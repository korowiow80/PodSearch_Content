Around 1994 I joined the band and introduced the FUNK factor which made the music more groove orientated. We managed together to compose several tunes which were then made into a CD by the title of In a Big Sea. Hard to imagine that was 13 years ago!
Unfortunately all good things come to an end at some point and I left the band in 96.</itunes:summary>

Rednek were a funk and hip hop band which toured through the 90&#039;s delivering an eclectic blend of funk n&#039; hip hop laced with lyrical rap and jazzy overtones. The band went through several line-up changes but always kept their up-front style through the strong rap/hip-hop vocal performances from front man Monty.

These two tracks are taken from one of the rehearsals during 1997 and were recorded on a sony walkman, therefore the mix is not ideal, but you can get the gist of what the band were about. I will try and dig some studio and live gig recordings in the near future.

A big thank you goes to all the members of Rednek who contributed with their dedication and funky sounds.</itunes:summary>

This eclectic funk track was created one evening around October 2006. It features Looped drums, bass, vibe guitar, percussion and a spoken vocal overdub on the subject of gravity, planets and starlight.

It is by no means finished as you will realise when you listen, I just need to hook up with some musicians. Doing solo tracks is nowhere near as good as collaborating with other like minded musicians.</itunes:summary>

    <itunes:summary>Love Travel and Funk :: 

This track kicked of with a simple bass line I funked up one evening in June, and is based on a good old D G sequence , so I thought I&#039;d add the rest of the instruments, which includes a drum loop, rhodes keys, rhythm guitar, and vocal overdubs.

I know.. the mix and production is not the george best, but at least it&#039;s encoded to 128kbps. 

The title of this tune is based on the nice feeling of having a combination of : LOVE : TRAVEL and FUNK : all at the same time, that is, if you are into these things... off course. The vocal narrative is about.. Frëe Travel and energy from Tesla&#039;s theories and experiments on freë energy sources. Aaah the name is wishful thinking.

&quot;Travelling - it&#039;s just the potential that exists&quot;

::  The love we give the love we share,
    The love we spread the love we show,
    will guide us through this time
    will spread through out the world.

If you want to spread some love, spread your own, and then add this one to the mix. ;-)</itunes:summary>
