            <description><![CDATA[Vicksburg was a Confederate fortress guarding the Mississippi River during the American Civil War.&nbsp; It was the only thing stopping the Union from taking control of the all-powerful Mississippi waterway.&nbsp; Although the Vicksburg Campaign is most famously associated with General Ulysses Grant (whose capture of the fortress is considered a major turning point in the war), there were many earlier Union campaigns to take control of Vicksburg.&nbsp; One of these campaigns, led by Navy Admiral David Farragut, is the focus of this episode.<br/><br/>The script for this episode was written by Jacob Bains from Texas.&nbsp; If you would like to submit your own script, please send it to militaryhistorypodcast@gmail.com<br/>]]></description>

			<title>Democracy in Iraq</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Democracy_in_Iraq.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Why has democracy failed in Iraq?&nbsp; Here are some potential theories, with their originators in parentheses:<br/>
<ul><li>Modernization (Rostow, Lipset): Iraq is not wealthy, urban,
modern, or secular enough to support democracy.&nbsp; It has not followed
the same path to development that Western democracies have set out, and
thus, it is not yet ready.</li><li>Cultural (Huntington, Weber): Iraqis are not inherently suitable
for democracy, simply because their culture favors an authoritarian
style of government.</li><li>Marxist (Moore, Marx): Iraq still has a strong landed elite and a
weak bourgeoisie, meaning that it is not ripe for class conflict and
thus, it is not ripe for social and political development</li><li>Voluntarist (Di Palma): Iraq lacks the strong leadership needed to usher the country into a democratic phase.</li></ul>

Each of these theories has its flaws and counterexamples, which will be
discussed in this episode.&nbsp; This is not meant to define one theory as
better than the rest...it is simply meant to put all ideas on the table.<br/>

Bush used in December of 2006 before choosing to commit the troop
surge.&nbsp; Things discussed include: the release of the Iraq Study Group
Report, the 2006 midterm elections, Bush's meeting with Generals Keane
and Downing, and Bush's relationship with General Petraeus and

            <description><![CDATA[Whether they are seen as acts of God, or as simple climate-related
occurrences, natural events have always had a sizeable impact on
military operations.<span>  </span>At the small end of the scale are the little changes in terrain or weather that may affect a battle or a small war.<span>  </span>For
example, many armies have postponed their campaigns due to inclement
weather conditions, and many militaries have suffered from rampant
disease.<span>  </span>On the other end of the scale are the
times when nature has so much of an impact that the fate of an entire
nation or civilization is decided upon it.<span>  </span>In
the words of Charles Darwin, these are times when “the war of nature”
results in the downfall of one party and the rise of another.<br/>
<ul><li>Colonization Smallpox: Rampant disease severely weakened the
Aztecs and Incas, allowing small bands of Spanish conquistadors (led by
Cortez and Pizarro, respectively) to easily overthrow two great empires.</li><li>Revolutionary Wind and Fog: Heavy winds subsided after the Battle
of Long Island, allowing American troops to evacuate and fight another
day.&nbsp; Their retreat was concealed by a dense fog.&nbsp; Later, just before
the Battle of Trenton, a heavy fog concealed the Americans long enough
to conduct a surprise attack which greatly boosted the morale of the
Continental Army.</li><li>Russian Winter: Cold temperatures forced Napoleon to retreat
after he failed to conquer Russia and find accommodations in Moscow.&nbsp;
The lack of grass and unfrozen roads resulted in the destruction of up
to 75% of Napoleon's Army as it marched back to France.</li></ul>

			<title>The Philosophy of War (2)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_Philosophy_of_War_2.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[According to Lawrence Keeley, &quot;90-95% of known societies engage in
war&quot;. Why? What compels homo sapiens to kill each other? Why do we
fight? Part one will describe two hypotheses.<br/><br/>War is Necessary:<br/>Aristotle
says in Nicomachean Ethics that &quot;we fight war so that we may live in
peace&quot;. This notion is echoed by many other famous thinkers including
Marx (an advocate of a final proletarian revolution in order to
establish a worker's paradise) and Zoroaster (the first monotheist to
discuss the final battle of judgment between good and evil).<br/><br/>War is Logical:<br/>Using
Darwin's logic, mankind continues to fight wars because it is the means
through which our species survives. Thomas Malthus adapted this into a
population argument, stating that humans fight wars in order to keep
populations small and manageable. Samuel Huntington took this one step
further by saying that war negates massive youth bulges. Lastly, John
Nash (the economist) proved, through game theory, that war is a more
logical choice than peace.<br/><br/>War is Accidental:<br/>AJP Taylor
argued that all wars are unintended and unhappy escalations of smaller
conflicts. Warmongering is neither inherent nor unavoidable. Taylor's
ideas link closely to the pacifistic ideas of Tolstoy and Gandhi.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/>Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle<br/>Communist Manifesto by Marx<br/>Holy Avesta, Holy Bible, Holy Qur'an<br/>Origin of Species by Darwin<br/>An Essay on the Principle of Population by Malthus<br/>Environmental Science by Richard Wright<br/>Clash of Civilizations by Samuel Huntington<br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[According to Lawrence Keeley, &quot;90-95% of known societies engage in
war&quot;. Why? What compels homo sapiens to kill each other? Why do we
fight? Part one will describe two hypotheses.<br/><br/>War is Rational:<br/>Sun
Tzu argued that political struggles would eventually lead to armed
conflict. Clausewitz took this one step further by saying that &quot;war is
a mere continuation of policy by other means&quot;. Machiavelli completed
this entire line of thought by saying that war was the most efficient
means of attaining any political goal.<br/><br/>War is Inevitable:<br/>Hobbes
argued that humans are inherently violent. Raymond Dart and Robert
Ardrey found a scientific basis for this by claiming that homo sapiens
became the dominant humanoid through their martial prowess (and we have
kept this prowess ever since). Another group of philosophers believe
that war can be attributed to the reckless aggression caused by
testosterone in males.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/>Sun Tzu's Art of War<br/>Clausewitz's On War<br/>Machiavelli's The Prince<br/>Mao's Quotations<br/>Hobbes' Leviathan<br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

			<title>Joan of Arc</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Joan_of_Arc.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<font size="3">Joan of Arc (1412-1431) was a poor peasant girl from
Lorraine. One day, she had a vision in which three saints urged her to
lead the French to victory over the English in the Hundred Years' War.
She traveled to Charles VII's court and was appointed head of the
French Army (headed to relieve the besieged city of Orleans) because
her unlikely presence would inspire hope in the French forces. Upon
arriving in Orleans, Joan launched several counterattacks against the
English and broke the siege in only eight days. Then, she led a
campaign to clear the English out of the Loire River Valley, eventually
liberating the city of Reims. <br/>
<br/>
During a later skirmish, Joan was captured and tried for heresy. She
was found guilty and burned at the stake. Later, she was exonerated and
made a saint. She has served a symbol of French nationalism and
feminist pride ever since.<br/>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Frederick_the_Great.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, is considered the best commander
of the European Enlightenment.&nbsp; Despite possessing relatively few
people and resources, he transformed the tiny Prussian state into a
great military power (which arguably wouldn't be brought down until
1945).&nbsp; Strategically, he modernized the Prussian military into a
well-trained, well-disciplined unit.&nbsp; He taught them to fire faster,
march with more precision, and deploy artillery quicker.&nbsp; Tactically,
he employed oblique tactics which massed all units on one side of the
battle line in order to sweep through the enemy forces one at a time
(instead of all at once).&nbsp; This allowed Frederick to achieve victories
against numerically-superior enemies at Hohenfriedberg, Rossbach, and
Leuthen.&nbsp; <br/>

			<title>Lincoln's Assassination</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Lincolns_Assassination.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth, a
southern sympathizer and a self-proclaimed modern-day Brutus, on April
14th, 1865 (five days after the end of the Civil War). Booth snuck into
Lincoln's viewing Booth at the Ford's Theater while Lincoln was
watching &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; and shot him in the back of the head.
Booth then jumped down onto the stage and ran out the back door. The
ensuing manhunt eventually caught up with him in the swamps of the
Potomac River. He was shot, and his co-conspirators were hanged.<br/><br/>The event has many interesting stories associated with it:<br/><ul><li>Lincoln
had a dream in which he walked into the East Room of the White House
and saw a casket. He asked the soldiers why there was a casket and the
soldiers told him that the President had been assassinated. He had the
dream three days before being assassinated.</li><li>Robert Todd
Lincoln, Abraham Lincoln's son, stood by his father's body as he passed
away. Strangely, Robert Todd Lincoln would also stand by the sides of
Presidents Garfield and McKinley (both shot by assassins) as they lay
dying.</li><li>Robert Todd Lincoln once fell onto the train tracks but was saved by Edwin Booth, John's brother.</li><li>Boston Corbett, the soldier who fatally wounded Booth, shot him in the exact same spot that Booth shot Lincoln.</li></ul>
There are also several conspiracy theories about the Lincoln Assassination:<br/><ul><li>Vice
President Johnson indirectly communicated with Booth on the day of the
assassination. He stood to gain the most from the death of Lincoln.</li><li>Confederate
Secretary of State Judah Benjamin might have ordered the assassination
of the opposing head of state for tactical reasons. Benjamin destroyed
all of his records after the surrender, and then fled to England and
never returned.</li><li>Secretary of War Edwin Stanton disliked Lincoln
for his moderate stance on many issues. Stanton prevented Ulysses Grant
(and his military escort) from attending &quot;Our American Cousin&quot; with
Lincoln (and potentially saving his life). He also lowered security on
the bridge that Booth used to flee into Maryland. He also destroyed a
few pages of Booth's diary before it was used as evidence in court.</li></ul>

			<title>Crassus vs. Spartacus</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Crassus_vs._Spartacus.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Crassus was the wealthiest man in Rome.&nbsp; Before he joined the First
Triumvirate with Pompey and Caesar, he struggled to make a name for
himself.&nbsp; His big break came with the outbreak of the Third Servile
War, when Spartacus led a slave rebellion throughout the Italian
Peninsula.&nbsp; Spartacus and his men wreaked havoc throughout the region,
defeating several Roman legions.&nbsp; Although his original plan was to
escape to Gaul and head home, Spartacus decided to head south towards
Sicily.&nbsp; However, his transport (the Cilician Pirates) failed to arrive
in time, and Crassus was able to bring his legions in from behind to
trap Spartacus.&nbsp; In the ensuing battle, Spartacus was killed and many
more slaves were crucified.&nbsp; Crassus achieved some fame but in the end,
his career would pale in comparison to Pompey and Caesar.&nbsp; He was
killed in Parthia after a failed showing at the Battle of Carrhae by
having molten gold poured down his throat.<br/>

			<title>The Anglo-Dutch Wars</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_Anglo-Dutch_Wars.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Today's episode's script was written by Andrew Tumath of Aberdeen,
United Kingdom.&nbsp; To submit your own script, please send them to me at
militaryhistorypodcast@gmail.com<br/>
<p style="font-family: georgia;">The Anglo-Dutch Wars were a series of the
distinct conflicts waged between England and the United Provinces (modern-day
Netherlands) in the middle years of the 17th-century. Fought for different
reasons, alongside different allies, and with different results, the wars
pitted the two great maritime powers of the period against each other, until
both came to realise that the real threat came from the France of Louis XIV.
Almost uniquely maritime in nature, there wasn’t a single action in the three
conflicts in which an English army faced a Dutch one.&nbsp; <br/>

            <description><![CDATA[This episode is an analysis of the environmental impacts of the current
war in Iraq.&nbsp; There are several major categories, each of which will be
discussed.&nbsp; This episode is meant to be an overview of the
rarely-discussed ecological situation in Iraq, rather than a persuasive
piece towards one viewpoint or another.&nbsp; The entire episode will
revolve around environmental issues--political and strategic issues and
biases will not be included.<br/>

The mighty American military during WWII would have been nothing
without its surprisingly-important rationing system.&nbsp; Food kept the
United States going, so therefore, it is well worth studying.&nbsp;
Throughout WWII and the years beyond, the US entered/exited several
&quot;eras&quot; of rations:<br/>
<ul><li>A Rations</li><li>B Rations</li><li>K Rations</li><li>C Rations</li><li>LRRP Rations</li><li>MREs</li></ul>

			<title>War in Bosnia</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/War_in_Bosnia.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[After the fall of the Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavian countries
began to divide along ethnic lines.&nbsp; Of the five states (Serbia and
Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, and Slovenia),
three of them began waging war:<br/>
<ul><li>Serbia (Orthodox Christians) under Slobodan Milosevic</li><li>Bosnia (Muslims) under Alija Izetbegovic</li><li>Croatia (Roman Catholics) under Franjo Tudjman</li></ul>

Initially, both Croatia and Serbia desired to take land from Bosnia.&nbsp;
However, as the war progressed, Croatia took the side of Bosnia in
order to push Serbia out of the region.&nbsp; Ethnic cleansing (especially
by the Serbs) was commonplace, and it wasn't until Croatian
intervention (on the ground with Operation Storm) and NATO intervention
(in the air with Operation Deliberate Resolve) that the war slowed
down.&nbsp; Eventually, after a four-year long siege of Sarajevo (the
Bosnian capital), the Dayton Accords were signed.<br/>
<br/>
However, the ethnic cleansing continued, most notably at Kosovo.&nbsp; After
another NATO intervention led by General Wesley Clark, peace was
restored again.<br/>

			<title>Operation Downfall</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Operation_Downfall.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Operation Downfall was the proposed invasion of mainland Japan by
Allied Forces near the end of WWII.&nbsp; It was canceled because the atomic
bombs were dropped and Japan surrendered, thereby removing the need for
a military conquest.&nbsp; It would have been the largest amphibious
invasion in history, and it would have been the first time that a
foreign power had set foot on mainland Japanese soil (in the country's
2500 year history).&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Operation Downfall had two parts: Operation Olympic (Nov 1945) and
Operation Coronet (March 1946).&nbsp; Both were commanded by MacArthur and
supported by Nimitz.&nbsp; Operation Olympic involved the I, V, IX, and XI
Corps storming the beaches of Kyushu (the southern main island) and
taking airbases to support Operation Coronet.&nbsp; Operation Coronet
involved the First Army and the Eighth Army, as well as numerous
British Commonwealth units, storming the beaches of Honshu near the
capital city of Tokyo.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
On the opposing side was Operation Ketsu Go, the Japanese defense of
its main islands.&nbsp; Most of Japan's forces (air and ground) were focused
on the island of Kyushu.&nbsp; Also, tens of millions of Japanese civilians
(all able-bodied civilians, men and women) were trained in basic
martial arts in order to repel the invasion.&nbsp; In addition, the Japanese
government created numerous suicide units to repel the invasion.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
All in all, it would have been one of the bloodiest battles in
history.&nbsp; An estimated 1 million Americans and 10 million Japanese
would have lost their lives.&nbsp; <br/>

			<title>The Peloponnesian War (Part Two)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_Peloponnesian_War_Part_Two.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
The Peloponnesian War was fought by Athens and Sparta in the late 5th
century BC.&nbsp; It was an epic war between two superpowers, and the
similarities to the Cold War are numerous.&nbsp; Since most people know
about the Cold War, since it was so recent, I will summarize this
episode via comparisons between it and the Peloponnesian War.<br/>

<br/>

This second episode covers the Amphipolis Campaign/Cuban Missile Crisis to the surrender of Athens.<br/>

<br/>

The Participants:<br/>

<ul><li>Athens/United States: wealthy, democratic, powerful navy, supported by numerous smaller states (Delian League/NATO)</li><ul><li>Initially led by Pericles/FDR: rulers during the expansion of their respective nations' geopolitical status<br/>
    </li></ul>
<li>Sparta/USSR: communist, totalitarian, powerful army, supported by numerous smaller states (Peloponnesian League/Warsaw Pact)</li><ul><li>Initially led by Archidamus II/Stalin: rulers during the expansion of their respective nations' geopolitical status</li></ul>
<li>Thebes/China: Weaker third power allied with Sparta/USSR</li></ul>


Timeline:<br/>

<ul><li>Persian Wars/WWII: Sparta/USSR and Athens/USA were originally allied in the fight against Persia/Axis</li><li>Pentecontaetia/Berlin Blockade: Sparta/USSR and Athens/USA
skirmish briefly over intermediate territory (Corinthian
Isthmus/Germany)</li><li>Archidamian War/Korean War: Sparta/USSR engages in a land war
with Athens/USA over intermediate territory (Corinthian
Isthmus/Germany).&nbsp; Results in a stalemate.</li><li>Pylos Campaign/Suez Crisis: Athens/USA intervenes in territory
close to Sparta/USSR in order to gain an economic and political
advantage.&nbsp; <br/>
  </li><li>Amphipolis Campaign/Cuban Missile Crisis: Sparta/USSR sneaks into the Athens/USA sphere of influence and creates an outpost.</li><li>Aegean Sea Propaganda Campaigns/Third World War: Sparta/USSR
provides support to revolutions in Athens/USA's sphere of influence.<br/>
  </li><li>Sicilian Expedition/Vietnam War: Athens/USA attempts to contain
Sparta/USSR's sphere of influence and fails miserably (loses lives and
money).</li></ul>


Where the analogy fails:<br/>

<ul><li>Sparta launches a successful, massive land invasion against
Athens (Problem: USSR never fought USA over Europe).&nbsp; Decisive victory
at the Battle of Mantinea<br/>
  </li><li>Sparta destroys the entire Athenian Navy at the Battle of
Aegospotami (Problem: USSR never defeated the American Navy decisively)</li><li>Athens surrendered to Sparta (Problem: The US won the Cold War)</li></ul>


So, the analogy isn't perfect, but it is still accurate in most
respects.&nbsp; After the Peloponnesian War, Thebes (the former third power)
swept down and became the new superpower (over both Sparta and Athens),
just like China seems to be becoming now (over the US).<br/>

			<title>Canadians at Vimy Ridge</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Canadians_at_Vimy_Ridge.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Battle of Vimy Ridge (April 1917) was a turning point in WWI. It
was the first great allied victory. It also continues to be the
greatest event in modern Canada's military history.<br/><br/>The 100,000 Canadians of the Canadian Corps were commanded by Arthur Currie.  Currie began numerous preparations including:<br/><ul><li>Giving maps to all Canadian troops, not just the officers</li><li>Training all Canadian troops on a replica of Vimy Ridge</li><li>Building an elaborate tunnel system underneath no man's land in order to carry men to the enemy front lines more quickly</li><li>Use air support (including the famous Billy Bishop, a Canadian flying ace) to protect against German recon<br/></li></ul>
The
actual battle began with a creeping barrage attack, in which over 1
million shells were fired by Canadian artillerymen. The creeping
barrage was followed by 20,000 charging Canadian troops, who
successfully all four trenches on Vimy Ridge. By midday on April 9th,
Hill 145 and the Pimple (a high point) were taken.<br/><br/>Four Victoria
Crosses were awarded in the battle. 3000 Canadians were KIA, and
another 7000 were wounded. 20,000 Germans were wounded and 4000 were
captured.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/><a href="http://www.northpeel.com/news/article/20719">http://www.northpeel.com/news/article/20719</a><br/><a href="http://www.legionmagazine.com/features/special/07-03a.asp?id=print#5">http://www.legionmagazine.com/features/special/07-03a.asp?id=print#5</a><br/><a href="http://wwii.ca/page9.html">http://wwii.ca/page9.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/vimy/">http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/vimy/</a><br/><a href="http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=14742">http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=14742</a><br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6373IRqSeU">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6373IRqSeU</a><br/><br/><span style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></span>]]></description>

			<title>The Most Dangerous Man in Europe</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_Most_Dangerous_Man_in_Europe.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>
&quot;The Most Dangerous Man in Europe&quot; was how Eisenhower described Otto
Skorzeny, Nazi Germany's most famous commando and special operations
leader.&nbsp; Before he became the leader of Jagdverbande 502 (a special
operations unit), Skorzeny fought on the Eastern Front and even won an
Iron Cross for bravery.<br/>
<br/>
His most famous mission was Operation Oak, the search and rescue of
Benito Mussolini, who had been captured and imprisoned by his rivals in
the Italy.&nbsp; Skorzeny led a glider assault on Gran Sasso Mountain, where
Mussolini was being held, and captured him without having to fire a
single shot.&nbsp; Skorzeny brought Mussolini back to Hitler.&nbsp; Hitler was
overjoyed.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Skorzeny was tasked to lead many other commando missions including:<br/>
<ul><li>Operation Rosselsprung: Kidnap Josip Tito (the future leader of communist Yugoslavia)</li><li>Operation Panzerfaust: Kidnap the son of Miklos Horthy (king of Hungary) to persuade him to stay in the Axis</li><li>Operation Greif: Infiltrate behind allied lines at the battle of the bulge and spread chaos and confusion</li></ul>

After the war, Skorzeny was imprisoned in Darmstadt prison.&nbsp; From the
prison, he operated the ODESSA network to smuggle Nazis (out of
Germany) to safety.&nbsp; He was put before a war crimes tribunal at one
point, but he was acquitted.&nbsp; On July 27th, 1948, he escaped from the
prison thanks to the help of several SS colleagues (disguised in
American uniforms).&nbsp; He then fled to Franco's Spain, Nasser's Egypt,
and Peron's Argentina.&nbsp; In Argentina, he fell in love with Eva Peron.&nbsp;
At the same time, he managed to secure large portions of the Bormann
treasure, named after Martin Bormann (Hitler's secretary) who smuggled
Nazi wealth out of Germany just before the Third Reich's collapse.&nbsp; He
died in 1975 of cancer.<br/>

			<title>The Sword of Allah (Part Two)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_Sword_of_Allah_Part_Two.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Sword of Allah refers to Khalid ibn al-Walid, the prophet
Mohammad's top general. Khalid commanded over 100 battles and never
lost, making him the most undefeated general in history. He usually
fought in the front lines either as a cavalry commander or as a
champion dueler. This is the first of a two-part episode. This part
will cover Khalid's conquest of Byzantine Syria:<br/><br/>Some famous
battles on the Syrian front include: Bosra, Ajnadayn, and Damascus. The
Siege of Damascus saw the first use of Khalid's unit of elite
cavalrymen, the Mobile Guard. However, the greatest battle in the
theater was the Battle of Yarmouk. Khalid had removed from command by
Umar (Abu Bakr's successor) but he still had operational command
because the nominal commander respected him so much. The Battle of
Yarmouk was fought between 100,000 Byzantines and 30,000 Arabs along a
battle line 12 miles long. After a series of significant duels
(including one where Khalid personally persuaded an enemy commander to
convert to Islam), the main battle began. For the first few days, it
was a stalemate. Eventually, though, Khalid managed to maneuver his
cavalry all the way around the Byzantines and flank them.<br/><br/>Soon after the battle, Umar, who believed that Khalid was gaining too much power, removed Khalid from command completely.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/><font size="2">Dictionary of Battles by David Chandler<br/><a href="http://www.ezsoftech.com/islamic/ohod.asp">http://www.ezsoftech.com/islamic/ohod.asp</a><br/><a href="http://islambyquestions.net/moreAbout/Hunayn.htm">http://islambyquestions.net/moreAbout/Hunayn.htm</a><br/><a href="http://islam.pakistanway.com/showtopic.aspx?topicid=266&typeid=25">http://islam.pakistanway.com/showtopic.aspx?topicid=266&amp;typeid=25</a><br/><a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/10_abu_bakr.htm">http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/10_abu_bakr.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045249/Khalid-ibn-al-Walid">http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9045249/Khalid-ibn-al-Walid</a><br/><a href="http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/00_abu_bakr.htm">http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Articles/companion/00_abu_bakr.htm</a><br/><a href="http://www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=1206">http://www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=1206</a><br/><a href="http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/muslimwars/articles/yarmuk.aspx">http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/muslimwars/articles/yarmuk.aspx</a><br/><font size="3"><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font></font></font>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Sword of Allah refers to Khalid ibn al-Walid, the prophet
Mohammad's top general.&nbsp; Khalid commanded over 100 battles and never
lost, making him the most undefeated general in history.&nbsp; He usually
fought in the front lines either as a cavalry commander or as a
champion dueler.&nbsp; This is the first of a two-part episode.&nbsp; This part
will cover Khalid's conquests of Arabia and Persia:<br/>
<br/>
Khalid ibn al-Walid originally fought with the Meccan Quraiysh tribe
against Mohammad and the Muslims.&nbsp; However, he converted after the
Battle of the Trench and joined the forces of Mohammad.&nbsp; His first
campaign as a Muslim commander was into Ghassanid Territory to fight
the Battle of Mutah, in which he led an expert retreat after the first
three Muslim commanders were killed.&nbsp; His second campaign involved
attacking south and east in order to conquer the Arabian Peninsula.&nbsp; He
participated in the conquest of Mecca and in the Battle of Hunayn.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
After Mohammad's death, Abu Bakr took over and formed the Rashidun
Caliphate (the first of three great Islamic Empires with the other two
being the Umayyad and Abbasid Dynasties).&nbsp; Khalid led the campaign to
reconquer all the tribes that left the Muslim confederation after
Mohammad's death.&nbsp; Specifically, he commanded the Muslims at the Battle
of Yamama, which was fought against the &quot;liar prophet&quot;, Musailima.<br/>
<br/>
After the Arabian Peninsula was retaken, Khalid was put in charge of
the Rashidun invasion of Iraq (which was held by the Sassanid
Persians).&nbsp; Some of the famous battles of the invasion include the
Battle of Chains, the Battle of Ullais, the Battle of Hira, and the
Battle of Al-Anbar.&nbsp; However, the most famous is the Battle of Walaja,
which is known as the eastern Battle of Cannae because of Khalid's
successful double envelopment of the Persians.&nbsp; To this day, Khalid and
Hannibal are the only ones to pull this off against a numerically
superior force.&nbsp; The Battle of Firaz is also important because Khalid
defeated a Persian army ten times his own (in numbers).&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The second part of this episode will cover Khalid's exploits in Syria.<br/>

			<title>Warsaw Uprisings - Contemnit Procellas</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Warsaw_Uprisings_-_Contemnit_Procellas.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Warsaw is the capital of Poland.&nbsp; It's motto is &quot;Contemnit Procellas&quot;,
which means &quot;it defies the storms&quot;.&nbsp; It is a fitting motto because
Warsaw continues to be the site of many uprisings, rebellions, and
power shifts.&nbsp; Two of them were especially devastating:<br/>
<ul><li>Warsaw Ghetto Uprising (1943): Led by Mordecai Anielewicz of the
ZOB and the ZZW.&nbsp; 1000 Jewish resistance fighters vs. 2842 German SS
forces.&nbsp; Jews are defeated, and deportations to extermination camps
continue.&nbsp; <br/>
  </li><li>Warsaw Uprising (1944): The largest underground movement in all
of WWII.&nbsp; Poland's attempt to assist the Allied war effort and make a
statement to the USSR that they are not interested in being occupied.&nbsp;
The Polish Home Army (AK) manages to hold off the Germans for a while
but, without Russian or Western assistance, the resistance crumbles.</li></ul>

Eventually, the war ended and Poland became part of the Warsaw Pact
(signed in Warsaw).&nbsp; 45 years later, Poland would be the first country
to revolt from Soviet rule.&nbsp; Warsaw is now the 8th most populous city
in the EU.<br/>

			<title>DARPA's Revolution in Military Affairs</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/DARPAs_Revolution_in_Military_Affairs.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) was founded in 1958 in order to ensure that the science gap
remained in the US's favor.&nbsp; Many great empires, such as the Mongols,
Chinese, Ottomans, Mughals, and later, the Soviets, fell from grace
because they missed out on major military revolutions, such as the
Gunpowder Revolution, the Two Industrial Revolutions, and the
Information Revolution.&nbsp; America was determined to not let it happen to
them.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Since its creation in 1958, DARPA has been at the forefront of technology and innovation.&nbsp; It's inventions since 1958 include:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Satellites</li>
  <li>GPS</li>
  <li>M-16 Rifle</li>
  <li>ARPANET (predecessor to the Internet)</li>
  <li>Stealth Fighters (F-117, B-2, F-22)</li>
  <li>Cruise Missiles</li>
  <li>UAVs (Predator, Global Hawk)</li>
  <li>UGVs (SWORDS, TALON, Packbot)</li>
</ul>







DARPA now focuses on nine major areas:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Robust, Secure, Self-Forming Networks</li>
  <li>Detection, Precision ID, Tracking, and Destruction of Elusive Targets</li>
  <li>Urban Area Operations</li>
  <li>Advanced Manned and Unmanned Systems</li>
  <li>Detection, Characterization, and Assessment of Underground Structures</li>
  <li>Space</li>
  <li>Increasing the Tooth To Tail Ratio</li>
  <li>Biorevolution</li>
  <li>Core Technologies</li>
</ul>







Many of its current &quot;Revolution in Military Affairs&quot; projects fall
under the Future Combat Systems Program.&nbsp; This includes the Future
Warrior battlesuit that can change color, carry more, become harder
than kevlar, heal the user, connect directly back to the command post,
sense dangers, change temperatures, and reinforce human muscles.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[This episode is a summary of the USS Scorpion incident of 1968 and a review of the book, <a href="http://www.scorpiondown.com/">Scorpion Down</a>,
by Ed Offley (Published by Perseus Books). The USS Scorpion, a
Skipjack-class nuclear submarine, was heading from the Mediterranean
Sea to Norfolk, Virginia, when it mysteriously sank, making it only the
second nuclear submarine that the US Navy has ever lost. The US Navy
and other authors claimed that the USS Scorpion and its 99 crew members
were lost because of a weapons accident or because of mechanical
failure. However, according to Ed Offley, the USS Scorpion was sunk by
the Soviets in retaliation for the US sinking the Soviet K-129
diesel-electric sub a few months before. <br/><br/>The book is written
by an experienced and well-qualified author. It is a must-read for
anybody who was involved with the submarine or with the search, and it
is a recommended read for any submarine enthusiasts or conspiracy
theory enthusiasts. To purchase, visit www.scorpiondown.com.<br/>

			<title>Major General Andrew Jackson</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Major_General_Andrew_Jackson.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Andrew Jackson was the 7th President of the United States.&nbsp; He had the
fourth highest rank of all the presidents, below Washington,
Eisenhower, and Grant.&nbsp; He is also considered to be the nation's ninth
greatest president, after Lincoln, FDR, Washington, Jefferson, Teddy
Roosevelt, Wilson, and Truman.&nbsp; Therefore, he is the second greatest
warrior-president in US History, after only George Washington, himself.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Jackson's military career began in the War of 1812.&nbsp; First, he
defeated Chief Red Eagle of the Creek Indians at the Battle of
Horseshoe Bend.&nbsp; Then, he defeated Sir Pakenham of the British at the
Battle of New Orleans.&nbsp; Even though the war was over at this point,
Jackson delivered Britain one of its greatest defeats in history, while
only suffering 21 casualties.&nbsp; In the Seminole War that followed soon
after, Andrew Jackson captured Spanish Florida and became its
territorial governor, thereby founding the state of Florida, which is
currently America's fourth most powerful state.<br/>
<br/>
Andrew Jackson's personal life was a tough one.&nbsp; &quot;Old Hickory&quot; got into
103 duels.&nbsp; He famously defeated Charles Dickinson, thought by many to
be the nation's greatest dueler, despite being shot two inches from the
heart.&nbsp; In the Senate Chamber, Jackson also sat next to Thomas Hart
Benton, the man who had shot him repeatedly while he lay on the floor
in a hotel in Nashville in a fight a few years earlier.&nbsp; While
president, he beat his would-be assassin with his own cane until his
aides apprehended him.&nbsp; Lastly, at his funeral, his pet parrot had to
be removed because it was swearing too much (a skill taught to it by
Andrew Jackson, himself).<br/>
<br/>
This episode only covers Andrew Jackson's life up to his presidency.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[As Supreme Allied Commander of the Southwest Pacific Area, Douglas MacArthur led an island-hopping campaign (Operation Cartwheel) known as &quot;hit em where they aint&quot;.&nbsp; He avoided major Japanese garrisons and conquered from Australia, up through New Guinea, and to the Philippines.&nbsp; Upon wading ashore at Leyte during the Battle of Leyte, he proclaimed &quot;I have returned&quot;.&nbsp; MacArthur was chosen to lead Operation Downfall (the invasion of Japan), but the war ended before the campaign began.&nbsp; After being present at the signing of the Japanese surrender aboard the USS Missouri, MacArthur became the military governor of Japan and led the reconstruction and occupation.&nbsp; One of his most famous acts as the governor was to exonerate Emperor Hirohito. <br/><br/>In 1950, MacArthur became the commander of UN Forces in the Korean War.&nbsp; After North Korea had pushed the South Koreans all the way to Pusan, MacArthur led a giant amphibious left hook into Inchon.&nbsp; He cut off the North Korean supply lines and pushed them all the way back to the Yalu River.&nbsp; MacArthur suggested to Truman that nuclear weapons be used, and he was fired as a result.&nbsp; He gave a famous speech to Congress in which he said, &quot;old soldiers never die, they just fade away&quot;.&nbsp; After that, he stayed away from the public (although he almost became a vice presidential candidate) until he died in 1964.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/>Armchair General (November 2005): Douglas MacArthur<br/>The Guinness Book of Military Blunders by Geoffrey Regan<br/>The Oxford Book of Military Anecdotes by Max Hastings<br/>The Pacific War Companion by Daniel Marston<br/>Reader's Digest Illustrated History of WWII<br/>The Dictionary of Battles by David Chandler<br/>http://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=3&amp;list=Ground<br/>http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/douglasmacarthurfarewelladdress.htm<br/><br/>Military History Podcast is sponsored by Armchair General Magazine]]></description>

			<title>The British Empire (Part 2)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_British_Empire_Part_2.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The British Empire is the largest (14.1 million square miles) and most
populous (532 million people) empire in history. It is the reason why
English is one of the world's most important languages, why 1/3 of the
world drives on the left, and why much of the world uses the
parliamentary system. Another testament to its power is the fact that
one of its former colonies, the United States of America, is the
current hyperpower.<br/><br/>In addition to colonizing the British Isles
and North America (discussed in part one), Britain colonized islands in
the South Atlantic, the South Pacific, and the Mediterranean (for the
purpose of Royal Navy bases). Britain also colonized Australia as a
penal colony. A joint-stock company, the British East India Company,
also controlled India from 1600 to 1857, when power was transferred to
the British crown as a result of the Sepoy rebellion. Significant
territorial gains were also made in Africa after the Berlin Conference
of 1884 during the Scramble for Africa time period. However, all of
these possessions became independent one-by-one after WWII, with the
exception of a few overseas territories. Most of the former colonies
still have ties to Britain through the Commonwealth of Nations.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/><font size="2"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2003_34_thu_01.shtml">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/2003_34_thu_01.shtml</a><br/><a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/uk/armada/back/backd.html">http://www.bl.uk/learning/histcitizen/uk/armada/back/backd.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.britishempire.co.uk/timeline/colonies.htm">http://www.britishempire.co.uk</a><br/>The Penguin Book of Historic Speeches by Brian MacArthur<br/>The Dictionary of Battles by David Chandler<br/>The Guinness Book of Military Blunders by Geoffrey Regan<br/><font size="12" face="&quot;"><font size="2">The <st1:city st="on"><st1:place st="on">Oxford</st1:place></st1:city> Book of Military Anecdotes by Max Hastings</font><br/><font size="3"><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.armchairgeneral.com">Armchair General Magazine</a></font></font></font></font>]]></description>

one of its former colonies, the United States of America, is the
current hyperpower.<br/>
<br/>
The British Empire began in 1066 with the Battle of Hastings, where
William of Normandy defeated King Harold II of the Saxons.&nbsp; Since then,
England has consolidated power by annexing Wales, Scotland, Ireland,
the crown dependencies, and numerous other territories and colonies
around the world.&nbsp; For example, thanks to Francis Drake's defeat of the
Spanish Armada in 1588, the United Kingdom has been able to expand
throughout the New World.&nbsp; In North America, Britain founded 13
colonies along the eastern seaboard of the modern-day United States.&nbsp;
North of these colonies, Britain founded the Dominion of Canada after
it defeated the French at the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.<br/>
<br/>
The next episode focuses on British expansion into Central America, South America, Africa, Asia, and the South Pacific.<br/>

			<title>Blitzkrieg</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Blitzkrieg.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>
Blitzkrieg (lightning war) was the military doctrine of Germany during
the first half of WWII.&nbsp; It consisted of an all-mechanized army blowing
through the enemy lines (via air support and artillery support) so fast
that the enemy would be overwhelmed and defeated.&nbsp; Blitzkrieg relied on
a highly mobile and highly professional army.&nbsp; It was developed after
WWII by Heinz Guderian, author of Achtung: Panzer.<br/>
<br/>
Blitzkrieg warfare was applied in five major places: Spanish Civil War,
Invasion of Poland, Battle of France, North Africa Campaign, Operation
Barbarossa.&nbsp; Each time, Germany's enemy was too surprised to
effectively defend itself.&nbsp; However, as the German war machine ran out
of resources and technical superiority, blitzkrieg methodology began to
disappear (at least in the German form).<br/>
<br/>
However, German blitzkrieg was neither the first nor the last use of
maneuver tactics in a combined arms fashion.&nbsp; Other examples include:
German Schlieffen Plan in WWI, Russian Deep Operations in WWII,
Operation Shock and Awe in Iraq War.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[The Falklands War is one of the few modern wars between two modern
adversaries (in this case, Argentina and Britain).&nbsp; The war was over
the Falkland Islands, off of the southeastern coast of Argentina which
Britain held and Argentina claimed.<br/>
<br/>
General Leopold Galtieri, leader of Argentina, decided to act because
he needed something to justify his military government.&nbsp; He launched
Operation Azul to successfully capture the islands.&nbsp; Margaret Thatcher,
leader of Britain, decided to respond militarily.<br/>
<ul><li>Air War: Operation Black Buck (UK) conducts air raids against
Argentinean targets.&nbsp; Argentina attempts to respond with its own air
force but fails.</li><li>Sea War: ARA General Belgrano is sunk by the HMS Conqueror (the
first and only nuclear submarine kill in history).&nbsp; The HMS Sheffield
is sunk by an Exocet missile.</li><li>Ground War: SAS conducts successful raid against Pebble Island
Airfield.&nbsp; Main Royal Marines force lands in East Falkland Islands and
defeats Argentinean defenders at Goose Green, Top Malo, Mount Harriet,
Two Sisters Ridge, Mount Longdon, Wireless Ridge, Tumbledown.&nbsp; British
retake capital city of Stanley.&nbsp; Argentina surrenders.</li></ul>

            <description><![CDATA[The Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), also known as Saddam's Qadisiyyah, the
Holy Defense, and the Iraqi-Imposed War, had a devastating effect on
both participants.&nbsp; The war features many attacks and counterattacks,
though in the end, nothing changed.&nbsp; Some causes of the war include:<br/>
<ul><li>Khuzestan Border Dispute</li><li>Struggle for Middle Eastern Supremacy</li><li>Sunni vs. Shiite Schism</li><li>Shatt al-Arab Waterway Dispute</li><li>Iranian-sponsored assassination attempt against Tariq Aziz (Iraqi minister)</li></ul>

Iraq's invasion of Iran went well at first.&nbsp; With technological and
tactical superiority, the Iraqis were able to retake the waterway and
much of Khuzestan.&nbsp; However, thanks to Iran's powerful air force and
its motivated militias, the Iraqi offensive was stopped.&nbsp; In 1982,
Operation Undeniable Victory took back much of what was lost for the
Iranians.&nbsp; In fact, the Iranians even went on a counter-offensive and
invaded Iraq.&nbsp; However, they were stopped at Basra thanks, in part, to
chemical weapons.&nbsp; Then, the Iraqis counterattacked and pushed the
Iranians back to pre-war borders.&nbsp; A ceasefire was agreed upon and the
war ended.<br/>
<br/>
Both sides had been supported by foreign powers, including the United States and the Soviet Union.&nbsp; <br/>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Nader_Shah-Napoleon_of_Persia.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Nader Shah was the founder of the Afsharid Dynasty of Persia, lasting
from 1736 to 1747.&nbsp; During this time, this &quot;second Alexander&quot; returned
Persia to its Sassanid-era borders.&nbsp; After pushing the anti-Safavid
Afghan invaders out of Persia, Nader invaded Afghanistan and took the
cities of Kabul, Kandahar, and Lahore.&nbsp; In the western theater, Nader
Shah gained many cities from Ottoman Mesopotamia, including Najaf,
Karbala, and Basra.&nbsp; However, he was stopped at the walls of Baghdad.&nbsp;
In the Eastern Theater, Nader Shah defeated the Mughals decisively at
the Battle of Karnal.&nbsp; From here, he continued on into Delhi, where he
indirectly killed 30,000 civilians and took many crown jewels,
including the Peacock Throne (valued at $1 billion dollars now) and two
180+ carat diamonds.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Nader Shah also conquered Oman and Bahrain.&nbsp; He founded the modern
Persian Navy.&nbsp; He even tried to reconcile Shiite Islam and Sunni Islam
but failed.&nbsp; Upon his assassination in 1747, the Persian Empire
descended, once again, into chaos.&nbsp; <br/>

			<title>Machiavelli's Prince</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Machiavellis_Prince.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Niccolo Machiavelli was a political and military philosopher around
1500AD in Florence, Italy during the Italian Renaissance.&nbsp; His name is
associated with shrewd, cunning rule.&nbsp; His most famous work, The
Prince, features many tips for princes to conquer territory (whether it
is decentralized, or centralized):<br/>
<ul><li>Destroy the previous hereditary line</li><li>Attack the strong, leave the weak</li><li>Act unilaterally</li><li>Live in the conquered territory</li><li>Send in colonists rather than soldiers</li><li>Commit all crimes simultaneously</li></ul>

Machiavelli's perfect &quot;Prince&quot; has a military background and extensive
knowledge in history, specifically military history.&nbsp; The Prince should
cultivate a loyal local militia, rather than having to rely on
mercenaries or auxiliaries.&nbsp; Large military campaigns should be
conducted frequently in order to distract the populace.<br/>

			<title>Shamil Basayev-Chechnya's Bin Laden (2)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Shamil_Basayev-Chechnyas_Bin_Laden_2.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Shamil Basayev became involved in the nearby Dagestan War after he lost
his bid for president. This prompted Vladimir Putin to launch the
Second Chechen War, which successfully reclaimed Grozny for the
Russians. Since then, Chechnya has been officially under Russian
control, but there is still a strong insurgency.<br/><br/>In 2003,
Shamil's subordinate launched an attack on a theater in Moscow. 850
hostages were taken and demands were made (the Chechens wanted an
immediate Russian withdrawal from Chechnya). After a few days of
negotiation, Putin allowed the Russian Spetsnaz to enter. The Spetsnaz
pumped a sleeping agent into the theater and knocked many of the
terrorists and hostages asleep. The Spetsnaz then entered and killed
all of the terrorists. Afterwards, many of the hostages got sick from
the gas.<br/><br/>In 2004, Shamil's men launched an attack on a school in
Beslan. 1200 teachers, parents, and children were taken hostage and
held in atrocious conditions for several days. Eventually, the Russians
raided the school. Many civilian casualties resulted from the fire that
resulted and approximately 1/4 of the hostages were killed.<br/><br/>In 2006, Shamil was killed (probably by Russian security forces).<br/><br/> For more information:<br/> <font size="2"><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/chechnyas-bin-laden/2006/07/11/1152383739940.html">Theage.com</a><br/>http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/shamil/shamil.htm<br/>http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2002/1104/cover/story.html<br/>http://www.caucasus.dk/publication1.htm<br/>http://www.smallwarsjournal.com/documents/wolvesden.htm<br/>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm<br/>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3624136.stm<br/>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3627406.stm<br/></font><br/> <font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Shamil Basayev is a politician and self-proclaimed terrorist fighting
for Chechnya's independence from Russia. Chechnya is a small Muslim
republic in southern Russia. Basayev has ties to Al Qaeda, the
Mujahideen, and many other terrorist networks.<br/><br/>He was active in
the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict, where his Abkhaz Battalion helped to
fight off the Georgian Army. This Abkhaz Battalion was then brought
back to defend Chechnya's capitol city of Grozny. Shamil held off
Russia's invading force (which went in under Yeltsin) for awhile but he
eventually had to flee.<br/><br/>In June 1995, when things weren't
looking good for the Chechen separatists, Shamil led an attack on a
hospital in Budyonnovsk and took 1800 people hostage. The
hostage-taking eventually resulted in a Russian withdrawal from
Chechnya, and Shamil became a national hero. A few months later, Shamil
would lead an assault of Grozny and he succeeded in taking the capital
back from the Russians. Due mostly to Shamil, the Russians lost the
First Chechen War.<br/><br/>For more information:<br/><font size="2"><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/in-depth/chechnyas-bin-laden/2006/07/11/1152383739940.html">Theage.com</a><br/>http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents/shamil/shamil.htm<br/>http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2002/1104/cover/story.html<br/>http://www.caucasus.dk/publication1.htm<br/>http://www.smallwarsjournal.com/documents/wolvesden.htm<br/>http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/chechnya2.htm<br/>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3624136.stm<br/>http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3627406.stm<br/></font><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Area_51.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode was written by Brian Liddicoat, a real estate attorney in Northern California. <br/><p>The words â��<st1:place st="on"><st1:placename st="on">Groom</st1:placename>  <st1:placetype st="on">Lake</st1:placetype></st1:place>â��
and â��Area 51â�� have achieved an almost myth-like quality thanks to
interest in UFOs and shows like the X-Files. But the real history of
this base is even more interesting than the fiction. The names â��Area
51â�� and â��Groom Lakeâ�� refer to a large flight test base in the Nevada
Desert, about 100 miles north of Las Vegas. The facility was originally
built by Lockheed in the 1950s to support early secret tests of the U-2
spyplane. It has hosted the first flights of some of <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>â��s
most ground-breaking aircraft, including the F-117 stealth fighter. Now
operated by the US Air Force as a detachment of the Air Force Flight
Test Center at Edwards Air Force Base, the <st1:placename st="on">Groom</st1:placename> <st1:placetype st="on">Lake</st1:placetype> facility continues to secretly test <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>â��s most secret aviation technology. </p>

			<title>Invading Iraq (2003)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Invading_Iraq_2003.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode will only cover the period between March 2003 and May 1 2003. <br/><br/>Reasons for Invading Iraq:<br/><ul><li>Iraq's possession of WMDs<br/></li><li>Saddam's link to Al Qaeda</li><li>Iraq's failure to respect no-fly zones</li><li>Tyrannical part of the Axis of Evil</li></ul>
The
United States Congress supported military action against Iraq, but the
UN did not approve of it. The US launched Operation Cobra II with the
coalition of the willing (consisting of 49 countries) and many military
contractors.&nbsp; The main invasion was in the South, where there were
three fronts:<br/>
<ul><li>Western Front: US's 3rd Infantry Division goes through Najaf and Karbala towards Baghdad</li><li>Central Front: US's 1st Marine Expeditionary Force goes through Nasiriyah towards Baghdad</li><li>Eastern Front: UK's 1st Armored Division goes through Basra towards Baghdad</li></ul>

A secondary invasion in the North was led by the 10th Special Forces
Group and the Kurdish Peshmerga.&nbsp; This force pushed through Mosul and
Kirkuk towards Baghdad.<br/>
<br/>
The actual invasion of Baghdad took place early in April, when Colonel
Perkins invented the concept of Thunder Runs--rapid mechanized thrusts
into the city to inspire shock and awe.&nbsp; Two thunder runs were sent
into Baghdad and eventually the city (minus Saddam Hussein) was taken.<br/>
<br/>
On May 1st, 2003, President Bush declared Mission Accomplished (excerpt in episode).<br/>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/French_Foreign_Legion.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The French Foreign Legion was founded in 1831 as France's non-citizen
military. Over the years, it consisted of many refugees, colonial
citizens, and people trying to start a new life. The training is hard
and only one in seven applicants makes it. After they complete their
tour of duty, a Legionnaire may receive a 10-year residential permit
and French citizenship.<br/><br/>The Legion's most famous military action
was in the Battle of Camaron in the Maximilian Affair in Mexico in
1863. 62 Legionnaires were defending a convoy when they were attacked
by 2,000 Mexican troops. The Legion fended off wave after wave until
they eventually ran out of ammo. At this point, they charged with their
bayonets. Their heroic actions saved the convoy. Since then, the French
Foreign Legion has served with honor and distinction in many major
world conflicts including the Franco-Prussian War, WWI, WWII, Vietnam
War, and Desert Storm.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/><a href="http://french-foreign-legion.com/">http://french-foreign-legion.com/</a><br/><a href="http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/E/escape_to_the_legion/legion.html">http://www.channel4.com/life/microsites/E/escape_to_the_legion/legion.html</a><br/><a>Galenet: French Foreign Legion</a><br/>Military History Magazine (September 2005): Intrigue <br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

			<title>Iranian Hostage Crisis (1979)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Iranian_Hostage_Crisis_1979.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Iranian Revolution of 1979 was fought between Shah Pahlevi
(supported by America and hated for his pro-American beliefs) and
Ayatollah Khomeini (and anti-American Islamist).&nbsp; Khomeini succeeded in
taking power from the Shah and created the Islamic Republic of Iran.&nbsp;
During the turbulent years that followed, 300 militants seized 63
hostages from the American embassy in Iran and held them for 444 days.<br/>
<br/>
Months of negotiations ensued and eventually, 11 of the hostages were
released prematurely.&nbsp; The others were almost rescued by President
Carter in Operation Eagle Claw, but due to a sandstorm, the operation
was a disastrous failure.&nbsp; It was such a great failure that the US
reformed its military and created a new unified combatant command,
SOCOM, and a new special forces regiment, the 160th SOAR.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The Iranians remained steadfast in their imprisonment of the hostages
until September 1980, when Iraq invaded Iran and launched the Iran-Iraq
War.&nbsp; As a result, Iran wanted a quick resolution to the hostage issue
and thus, the Algiers Accords were signed by the United States and
Iran.&nbsp; The hostages were returned on Reagan's inauguration day.&nbsp;
However, tensions between these two countries still exist today (see
Iranian capture of 15 British sailors).&nbsp; <br/>

            <description><![CDATA[The battle of Thermopylae was fought between 7000 Greeks under Leonidas
(including 300 Spartans) and 500,000-2.5 million Persian troops under
Xerxes. Xerxes had marched across the Hellespont towards Greece because
he wanted Greece to become a satrapy of his and submit to his divine
will by giving him earth and water. The two armies met at a
50-foot-wide pass in Northern Greece and here, a small phalanx of Greek
hoplites held off wave after wave of Persian infantrymen, cavalrymen,
and Immortals. The Spartans demonstrated their bravery again and again,
and their lifelong devotion to military training proved to pay off.<br/><br/>Eventually,
Ephialtes (a Greek traitor) led the Persians around the pass to the
rear of the Greek defenders. Surrounded, the Spartans and Thespians
were killed by a volley of arrows. Leonidas, himself, looked forward to
dying because the oracle at Delphi prophesized that his death would
save Sparta.<br/><br/>For more information:<br/>300 (Movie)<br/><a href="http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/persian_wars5.php">http://www.iranchamber.com/history/articles/persian_wars5.php</a><br/>Histories by Herodotus<br/><a href="http://www.greektexts.com/library/Herodotus/Polymnia/eng/242.html">http://www.greektexts.com/library/Herodotus/Polymnia/eng/242.html</a><br/>Extreme War by Terrence Poulos<br/>Military Anecdotes by Max Hastings<br/>Military History Magazine (January 2006): Spartan Stand at <st1:place st="on">Thermopylae</st1:place><br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a> and the <a href="http://www.airwar-worldwar2.com/">International Research and Publishing Corporation</a></font>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Hashshashins (where we get our word &quot;assassins&quot;) were active during
the Abbasid Era of the Arab Period of Hegemony within the Islamic
Period of Hegemony. The Hashshashins were Nizari Ismaili Shiite
Muslims. They were led by Hassan-i-Sabah who, through the use of
hashish, gave his recruits the impression that he was God and he wanted
them to do his will. Until the coming of the Mongols under Hulagu Khan,
the Hashshashins were very good at their job and they assassinated many
high-profile people.<br/><br/>Though they are one of the most famous
assassin groups, they are by no means the only ones. Others include Al
Qaeda, the Mafia, the Black Hand, the IRA. The CIA, for example, is
reported to have made 638 attempts to remove Castro from power.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/>Military History Magazine (October 2002): Perspectives<br/>Islamicity.com<br/>Al Qaeda Training Manual<br/>Quran<br/>638 Ways to Kill Castro<br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a> and the <a href="http://www.airwar-worldwar2.com/">International Research and Publishing Corporation</a></font>]]></description>

			<title>Knights Templar</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Knights_Templar.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Knights Templar was a Christian military order founded during the
Crusades in order to protect Christian pilgrims traveling to the Holy
Land.&nbsp; These &quot;Monks of War&quot; were highly disciplined and they
participated at many major battles during all nine Crusades, including
the pivotal Battle of Hattin.&nbsp; They also founded the first modern
checking/credit system, which made the organization wealthy enough to
buy the island of Cyprus.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The Templars were exempt from all laws (except those given by the Pope)
and as a result, they were feared by the kings of Europe.&nbsp; One king,
Philip the Fair, decided to deal with the problem and on Friday the
13th, he simultaneously betrayed and backstabbed all of the Templars.&nbsp;
The Templars then disappeared from history, though many groups (such as
the Freemasons), have claimed that they are extensions of this famous
organization.<br/>

			<title>Clausewitz's Principles of War</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Clausewitzs_Principles_of_War.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Carl Von Clausewitz was a military philosopher during the time of
Napoleon.&nbsp; His most famous contribution is the book, On War, which
outlines nine principles of war that are used in officer schools for
many Western armies including the United States Army.&nbsp; They are:<br/>
<ul><li><font size="2">Mass</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">&quot;Get there first with the most&quot;</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: Mass-based armies of Russia (ex. infantry) and the US (ex. M4 Sherman Tanks) during WWII led to general victory <br/>
      </font></li></ul>
<li><font size="2">Objective</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">Choose an objective and stick with it</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: Coalition troops maintained the
objective in Operation Desert Sabre and didn't try to do too much by
entering Iraq, which we now know would have caused major problems.<br/>
      </font></li></ul>
<li><font size="2">Offensive</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">Seize the Initiative</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: General McClellan's Army of the Potomac in the American Civil War failed to seize the initiative</font></li></ul>
<li><font size="2">Maneuver</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">Move to more advantageous positions</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: Hannibal's Army at the Battle of Cannae maneuvered around the larger Roman Army and defeated it</font></li></ul>
<li><font size="2">Unity of Command</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">Place your entire force under the command of a single entity</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: Japanese defenders on Iwo-Jima wasted
lots of time and effort by switching commanders halfway through the
preparation effort</font></li></ul>
<li><font size="2">Security</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">Don't let the enemy rob you of your advantages</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: Japanese Navy at Midway lost its element of surprise (because its communications were intercepted) and lost</font></li></ul>
<li><font size="2">Simplicity</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">Keep your plans clear and simple</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: Guerrilla militiamen (ex. Aidid's
militia in the Battle of Mogadishu) have a much simpler plan that the
professional armies they have to fight</font></li></ul>
<li><font size="2">Surprise</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">Attack when the enemy least suspects it</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: Germanic tribes slaughtered 24,000 professional Roman soldiers at the Battle of Teutoberg Forest</font></li></ul>
<li><font size="2">Economy of Force</font></li><ul><li><font size="2">Allocate your limited forces wisely</font></li><li><font size="2">Example: Germany Army during WWII did not get immediately overrun despite a 13million-56million numerical disadvantage</font></li></ul>
</ul>

1957 was defined by the Cold War and defined by the Eisenhower
Presidency.&nbsp; 1957 was when Eisenhower was inaugurated for a second term
in office, and during this term, the Eisenhower Doctrine (US defense
against all Soviet aggression), NASA, the European Economic Community,
and the United States were all created.&nbsp; Around this time, Eisenhower
was also responsible for the ending of the Little Rock Nine Crisis, the
end of Joseph McCarthy's Red Scare, the closing of the Science Gap
between the US and the USSR (who was already a space power via
Sputnik), the nomination of Earl Warren (14th Chief Justice), and so on.<br/>
<br/>
1957 was also the birth of my mom.&nbsp; Happy Birthday, Mom.<br/>

			<title>European Martial Arts</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/European_Martial_Arts.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>
<span style="color: black;">Despite the fact there is a 
            more than 2,400-year-old military tradition within Western civilization 
            of close-combat proficiency, few subjects have received as unfortunate 
            neglect by historians and academics than the martial arts of Western 
            Europe. But a growing amount of modern research has centered on the 
            historical methods of <i>using</i> various types of Medieval and Renaissance 
            swords and weaponry in historically accurate and martially sound manners.<span> </span>This emerging study of historical European 
            <i>martial arts </i>involves a fascinating combination of military 
            history, fencing history, literature, art, language, and archaeology.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: black;">The history of European arms and armor is

    itself one of established continuity marked by sudden developments of necessitated

    innovation.<span>&nbsp; </span>As new tools were devised, so too

    were new methods for using them. These methods in turn influenced still newer designs.<span>&nbsp; </span>By studying the historical systems for employing

    such arms and armor, we come to the best possible understanding for how and why they were

    designed as they were. This further leads to a greater appreciation for the little known

    martial arts of the age.</span> <br/>

            <description><![CDATA[China's People's Liberation Army is threatening to the United States
Armed Forces because it is fighting a &quot;People's War&quot; (7 million Chinese
troops vs. 2.5 million US troops) under &quot;modern conditions&quot; (China's
GDP will exceed America's by 2011). China also has significant
international backing from the UN, ASEAN, SCO, etc. Therefore, these
two superpowers are destined to clash in some way. <br/><ul><li>When (analysis of each area is included in episode):</li><ul><li>Unconventional Warfare: US is way ahead</li><li>Air Forces: US is ahead</li><li>Naval Forces: US is ahead</li><li>Ground
Forces: US is ahead, but China is quickly catching up (this means that
China will be able to fight regional conflicts but not global ones)</li></ul>
<li>Where (analysis of each area is included in episode):</li><ul><li>Taiwan</li><li>Kazakhstan</li><li>North Korea</li><li>Middle East</li><li>India</li><li>Southeast Asia</li></ul>

			<title>Iraq Study Group Recommendations</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Iraq_Study_Group_Recommendations.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The
Iraq Study Group Report's Recommendations Sections gives a total of 79
recommendations for how the US should proceed in Iraq.&nbsp; Diplomatically,
the US should do more by launching the New Diplomatic Offensive
accompanied by the creation of a Support Group (full of regional and
world powers) in order to discuss and compromise on a variety of
issues.&nbsp; This support group should include Iran and Syria because, even
though the White House has problems with their respective governments,
both countries would benefit from negotiating since both countries put
a lot of effort into Iraq.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Also, the US should threaten withdrawal whenever the Iraqi Government
does not reach its benchmarks on time (these include the ratification
of the Petroleum Law, the Militia Law, etc.).&nbsp; Even if it does reach
these benchmarks, though, the US should begin a gradual rollback of
forces.&nbsp; First, active combat forces should be moved into Iraqi Army
Brigade protection roles, Iraqi Army training roles, and Iraqi Army
support roles (Special Operations, Air Support, etc.).&nbsp; Then, these
training forces should also be slowly pulled out of Iraq as the Iraqi
security forces gain more power.&nbsp; By early 2008, the US should be 100%
training and 0% occupation.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The Iraq Study Group
is a bipartisan commission led by James Baker and Lee Hamilton. This
episode summarizes the recommendations section of the Iraq Study Group
Report. The previous episode featured the Iraq Study Group's assessment of the current situation.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[The Iraq Study Group Report's Assessment section is an excellent
summary of post-war Iraq.&nbsp; Some topics addressed include the division
of the country into Kurd, Shiite, and Sunni regions, the lack of unity
in Parliament, the powerful hold that Muqtada Al-Sadr has on Prime
Minister Nouri al-Maliki, the fierce fight over oil revenues, the lack
of Iraq's own security force, and so on.&nbsp; <br/>

            <description><![CDATA[The United States Secret Service was originally founded (in 1865) as an
anti-counterfeiting unit in the Treasury Department.&nbsp; However, once
President McKinley was assassinated, the Secret Service assumed
presidential protection duties.&nbsp; As of 2002, the Secret Service
(Special Agents and the Uniformed Division) is part of the Department
of Homeland Security.&nbsp; They are also part of Marine One, Air Force One,
and Cadillac One (all of which are described in this episode).&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Throughout their history, the Secret Service has witnessed and/or
foiled many assassination attempts including ones on: Teddy Roosevelt,
FDR, Truman, Kennedy, Ford, Reagan, Clinton, and Bush Jr.&nbsp; <br/>

            <description><![CDATA[Viktor Anatolyevich Bout is the world's most notorious arms dealer
since the end of the Cold War.&nbsp; His success lies in the fact that
Russia had many arms depots and planes lying around after the end of
the arms race.&nbsp; Bout was able to take advantage of this and build an
air empire which could carry arms to all sides at a moments notice in a
reliable fashion.&nbsp; Bout's clients include: the United States, the
United Nations, Angola, Congo, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Iraq, Taliban,
Northern Alliance, Somalia, and so on.&nbsp; Despite the INTERPOL warrant
for his arrest, Viktor Bout is still conducting both legal and illegal
operations because world leaders rely on him to do their dirty work for
them.&nbsp; <br/>

            <description><![CDATA[Mao and the Chinese Communist Party's victory was both psychological
and physical.&nbsp; The psychological is a combination of power vacuum in
rural China, the incompetency of the GMD, and the populist policies of
Mao.&nbsp; The majority of this episode is my opinion on why the final
reason is the most important.&nbsp; The physical relies on 3 major campaigns
conducted by the Communists: Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin.&nbsp; The final
few minutes of this episode discuss this Chinese Civil War (1945-1949).<br/>

			<title>The Lion of the North</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_Lion_of_the_North.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Listen to &quot;The Lion of the North&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gustavus Adolphus II the Great, the Lion of the North, was an innovator
as the king of Sweden and the commander of its armies.&nbsp; His innovations
include the conscription system, the tribute system, the squadron-based
organization system, the Swedish infantry weaponry, and the artillery
regiment system.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
All of these useful improvements were demonstrated during the Baltic
Campaigns and during the Thirty Years War.&nbsp; One example is the Battle
of Breitenfield, in which he defeated a larger Holy Roman Empire Army,
despite the fact that one of his allies fled during the battle.&nbsp; He was
killed a few years later in another one of his victories, the Battle of
Lutzen.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The Lion of the North (the name was given to him by Protestants in
Germany) is, without a doubt, the greatest commander in Swedish history
and the greatest commander in the 1600s.&nbsp; <br/>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Medal_of_Honor_in_Iraq.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[There have only been two medal of honor winners in Operation Iraqi
Freedom thusfar (despite the Iraqi War having lasted just as long as US
involvement in WWII, when there were 464 medals awarded).&nbsp; They are the
3rd and 4th medals awarded since the Vietnam War.<br/>
<ul><li>Paul Ray Smith (posthumous): Single-handedly fought off 100 enemy
Iraqi Republican Guardsmen with an M2 Browning Machine Gun and
essentially saved the lives of his 16 men and the 100 wounded in the
nearby aid station near Saddam Hussein International Airport.</li><li>Jason Dunham (posthumous): Saved the lives of his fireteam as he
smothered a grenade with his head, sacrificing his life in order to
stop the blast from reaching his companions.&nbsp; He is the first marine to
receive the medal since 1945.</li></ul>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/English_Longbowmen.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In the history of archery, the title for most important invention
probably goes to the English Longbowmen (or the Mongolian Recurve Bow
which you can learn more about in the &quot;Mongolian Fighting Tactics&quot;
episode).&nbsp; English Longbowmen brought about the end of the
cavalry-dominated era and retained dominance over Europe for a period
of around 300 years.&nbsp; Specifically, they allowed the English to
dominate the French at the battles of Crecy (1346), Poitiers (1356),
and Agincourt (1415).&nbsp; Though the English eventually lost the Hundred
Years War, the English Longbowmen still made their mark.<br/>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Propaganda.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Propaganda has been used in war since the beginning of war itself.&nbsp;
Alexander the Great used it, Genghis Khan used it, the Catholic Church
used it, the American Founding Fathers used it, Joesph Goebbels of Nazi
Germany used it, and the United States currently uses it.<br/>
<br/>
There are three types of propaganda: white, grey, and black.<br/>
<br/>
There are many techniques for propaganda, including: assertion,
bandwagon, card stacking, glittering generalities, lesser of two evils,
name calling, pinpointing the enemy, plain folks, testimonials, and
transfers.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[The Naval Ages: Galleys, Sails, Steam, Missiles.&nbsp; This episode focuses on the third naval age, the Naval Age of Steam.<br/>
<br/>
The Third Naval age began with ironclad battleships, also known as
pre-dreadnoughts, which effectively used artillery guns, iron plating,
and steam power.&nbsp; The keynote war of this naval era is the
Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), specifically the Battles of Tsushima
Strait and Port Arthur.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
Once the HMS Dreadnought was created, the dreadnought battleship era of
the Naval Age of Steam began.&nbsp; This era would last until WWII.&nbsp; The
keynote battle of this era was the Battle of Jutland in WWI.<br/>
<br/>
The Third Naval Age ended in WWII as a result of the aircraft carrier,
which replaced battleships as the principle ship of the fleet.&nbsp; <br/>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Operation_Enduring_Freedom.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Operation Enduring Freedom, specifically the 2001 war in Afghanistan,
was the first step to President Bush's war on terror.&nbsp; It is known as
the greatest special forces war ever fought because of the US's heavy
reliance on a few highly-trained operatives on the ground pinpointing
targets for a high-tech force in the air.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The war was fought between the Coalition (consisting mostly of US
forces)/Northern Alliance (Afghan rebels) and the Taliban (Afghan
government)/Al Qaeda (led by Osama bin Laden).&nbsp; The was was pretty much
one-sided, with the Northern Alliance ground offensive easily sweeping
through Kabul, the capital of the Taliban, and Kandahar, the military
stronghold of the Taliban.&nbsp; The one battle that the Coalition/Northern
Alliance arguably lost was the Battle of Tora Bora, in which Osama bin
Laden was cornered but somehow escaped.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it is the insurgency that is causing problems for the new government led by Hamid Karzai.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
The war is seen as a &quot;good war&quot; by both sides of the political aisle.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[The Red Raiders of the 22nd Bombardment Group were involved in almost
every single major action in the Pacific Theater of World War II.&nbsp;
Starting out as a medium bomber group (equipped with the B-25 Mitchell
and the B-26 Liberator), the &quot;silver fleet&quot; turned into a heavy bomber
ground once it was outfitted with the new B-24 Liberator heavy bomber.&nbsp;
<br/>
<br/>
The group's amazing five-year history is explained thoroughly in the
book: Revenge of the Red Raiders (The Illustrated History of the 22nd
Bombardment Group during WWII).&nbsp; This illustrated encylopedia contains
over 1000 pictures (w/detailed captions), 5 comprehensive appendices,
and 624 pages of detailed (albeit thick) information.&nbsp; The pros and
cons of the book are discussed within the episode.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[Now that we are in the information age, armies everywhere have begun
research on robotics, both surface ones and airborne ones.&nbsp; This
episode is about the surface ones.<br/>
<br/>
Robots are useful because they never get distracted, they never get
tired, and they never get fearful.&nbsp; Also, commanders don't have to
worry about human loss when they are using robots.&nbsp; Some of the more
famous robots currently used include:<br/>
<ul><li>MDARS: Autonomous, resembles R2D2 from Star Wars, patrols and secures DoD storage sites</li><li>TOV: Teleoperated, resembles a Humvee, used to identify enemy armor and designate air strikes</li><li>TALON/SWORDS: Teleoperated, miniature tanks equipped with a variety of sensors and weapons</li><li>Packbot: Teleoperated, man-portable, durable and used to scout out the other side of a wall</li><li>AUV: Autonomous, underwater, used to identify aquatic minefields</li><li>Super Scorpio: Teleoperated, underwater, used to recover lost naval equipment</li></ul>

            <description><![CDATA[If you ask a historian why the study of history is important, he/she
would probably respond with: &quot;to not repeat the mistakes of the past&quot;.&nbsp;
This is true, history does help us improve from our mistakes.&nbsp; However,
we also must keep in mind that trivial events (i.e. accidents) do
happen, and they do manage to alter the course of history
significantly.&nbsp; Therefore, this statement must be taken with a grain of
salt.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
For example,<br/>
The powerful Persian Empire, and consequently Zoroastrianism, rose as a
result of the one bodyguard peering on a Lydian king's wife naked.<br/>
The legendary Roman Republic began as a result of one Roman woman getting raped by an Etruscan man.&nbsp; <br/>
The infamous Middle East conflict and the continued dispute over
control of Jerusalem resulted from one Roman soldier accidentally
dropping a torch on the Second Temple.&nbsp; <br/>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Napoleon_Emperor-Death.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode begins with
two victorious campaigns for Napoleon. The first was against the
Russians and the Austrians (the Third Coalition), whom he defeated at
the Battle of Austerlitz (which is considered his greatest tactical
masterpiece). Then, he defeated the Prussians and Russians in the War
of the Fourth Coalition at Friedland, Jena, and Eylau. However, this
marked the beginning of the end for Napoleon because he four major
cracks began to form within his empire: the failure of the Continental
System against Britain, the prolonged guerilla uprising in Spain, the
Austrian defense at the Battle of Wagram, and the failure of the long
and harsh campaign into Russia.<br/><br/>Once Napoleon was weak, the
other nations formed a Sixth Coalition which finally defeated Napoleon
at the Battle of the Nations. Napoleon lost much of his army and was
forced to abdicate once Paris was lost. He was exiled to Elba but later
came back and formed another army during the period known as the 100
days. The 100 days ended with the Battle of Waterloo, in which the Duke
of Wellington (Britain) defeated Napoleon's inexperienced army.
Napoleon was once again exiled, this time to St. Helena, where he
stayed until his death.<br/><br/> For more information, read:<br/>                      <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2"><font>            </font>Military History Magazine (February 2002): Napoleon’s Haitian Guerilla War<br/><font>            </font>Military History Magazine (August 1999): Final French Triumph in <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region><br/><font>            </font>Military History Magazine (December 2005): <st1:place st="on"><st1:city st="on">Austerlitz</st1:city></st1:place><br/><font>            </font>Military History Magazine (October 2005): Nelson at Trafalgar<br/><font>            </font>Armchair General Magazine (July 2005)<br/><font>            </font>The <st1:city st="on"><st1:place st="on">Oxford</st1:place></st1:city> Book of Military Anecdotes by Max Hastings<br/><font>            </font>Extreme War by Terrence Poulos<br/><font>            </font>The Guinness Book of Military Blunders by Geoffrey Regan<br/><font>            </font>Dictionary of Battles by David Chandler<br/><font>            </font>World Book (1992): Napoleon<br/></font></p>

            <description><![CDATA[As First Consul, Napoleon set out for Italy and again defeated the Austrians at the Battle of Marengo. Also, around this time, Napoleon became consul for life and soon after, he was crowned Emperor of France. However, as emperor, Napoleon still had problems, namely in Haiti (where a rebellion under Toussaint L'Overture had taken place). In addition to losing this war, Napoleon lost the key naval battle of Trafalgar to Lord Nelson of the British Royal Navy. This made it so that Britain would always remain a thorn in the side of Napoleon's Europe. <br/><br/>For more information, read: <br/><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Military History Magazine (February 2002): Napoleon’s Haitian Guerilla War <br/>Military History Magazine (August 1999): Final French Triumph in <country-region st="on"><place st="on">Egypt</place></country-region> <br/>Military History Magazine (December 2005): <place st="on"><city st="on">Austerlitz</city></place> <br/>Military History Magazine (October 2005): Nelson at Trafalgar <br/>Armchair General Magazine (July 2005) <br/>The <city st="on"><place st="on">Oxford</place></city> Book of Military Anecdotes by Max Hastings <br/>Extreme War by Terrence Poulos <br/>The Guinness Book of Military Blunders by Geoffrey Regan <br/>Dictionary of Battles by David Chandler <br/>World Book (1992): Napoleon <br/></font></p>

            <description><![CDATA[Napoleon's tactics and innovations (described in detail in this episode), allowed him to rule Europe for several years. This can be seen in his victorious Italian Campaign (against the First Coalition), as well as his victories in Egypt at the Pyramids and at Aboukir Peninsula. After these two great victories, Napoleon returned to France and participated in a coup which formed a consulate government with himself as the First Consul (the most powerful man in France). <br/><br/>For more information, read: <br/><p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2">Military History Magazine (February 2002): Napoleon’s Haitian Guerilla War <br/>Military History Magazine (August 1999): Final French Triumph in <country-region st="on"><place st="on">Egypt</place></country-region> <br/>Military History Magazine (December 2005): <place st="on"><city st="on">Austerlitz</city></place> <br/>Military History Magazine (October 2005): Nelson at Trafalgar <br/>Armchair General Magazine (July 2005) <br/>The <city st="on"><place st="on">Oxford</place></city> Book of Military Anecdotes by Max Hastings <br/>Extreme War by Terrence Poulos <br/>The Guinness Book of Military Blunders by Geoffrey Regan <br/>Dictionary of Battles by David Chandler <br/>World Book (1992): Napoleon <br/></font></p>

			<title>Arabs vs. Israelis (1967)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Arabs_vs._Israelis_1967.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Six Day War of 1967 was fought between Israel and an Arab Coalition
(including Jordan, Syria, Egypt, and Iraq).&nbsp; Israel used the Egyptian
blockade of the Straits of Tiron, the massing of Egyptian tanks against
the Israeli border, the Syrian shelling of Galilee fishermen, and the
Syrian plan to divert drinking water from Israel as reasons for
launching their attack.<br/>
<br/>
Operation Focus was the Israeli air campaign, which easily wiped out
the air forces of the entire Arab Coalition.&nbsp; Following Operation Focus
was a charge eastward into Jordan's West Bank.&nbsp; The Israelis quickly
captured the eastern part of the holy city of Jerusalem.&nbsp; At the same
time, the IDF charged southwards towards Egypt's Sinai peninsula and
Gaza Strip.&nbsp; The IDF, led by future prime minister Ariel Sharon,
quickly dispatched the Egyptian army and conquered the entire Sinai
region.&nbsp; On the Syrian Front, the Israelis charged up the Syrian Golan
Heights on Day 5 of the Six Day War and took them.&nbsp; <br/>
<br/>
All four of these regions are still in dispute.&nbsp; Israel returned Gaza and Sinai, but not the Golan Heights or the West Bank.<br/>

            <description><![CDATA[The future US Air Force's backbone consists of one fighter aircraft and one bomber: the F22 Raptor and the B2 Spirit. <br/><br/>F22 Raptor:<br/>
Set to replace the F117 Nighthawk and the F15 Eagle, this $350 million
stealth fighter aircraft is the ultimate air superiority weapon. In
addition to carrying a significant amount of air-to-air missiles (ex.
AIM-120 and AIM-9), the F22 can travel at Mach 2.42 into enemy airspace
without being detected. Also, its radar will allow it to see all
enemies way before the enemies suspect anything. The radar also has the
ability to jam an enemy aircraft's systems, while the computer can
easily link up with an allied F22s computer. When it comes to precision
ground strikes, the F22 relies on its JDAMs and SDBs.<br/><br/>B2 Spirit:<br/>
At $2 billion each, the B2 is worth more than twice its weight in solid
gold. Though it is slow, it can go anywhere in the world with only one
in-flight refueling. Its greatest feature, however, is its boomerang
flying wing design which allows it to have a radar signature equivalent
to that of a small bird. But just because it is stealthy does not mean
that it cannot carry a huge payload. In fact, it can carry 80 &quot;dumb
bombs&quot;, 36 cluster bombs, 16 &quot;smart bombs&quot;, and 16 nuclear bombs. Also,
it can drop 16 different bombs at 16 different targets simultaneously.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/>USAF Fast Facts by Trident Press International<br/><a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.f22fighter.com">www.f22fighter.com</a><br/><a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/stealth-bomber6.htm">How Stealth Works in the B2</a><br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Soldiers of Fortune, or
Mercenaries, have been used in war since the advent of war itself. The
Persians, the Romans, the Greeks all used mercenaries in their armies.
The trend continued into the middle ages when German Landsknechts and
Swiss Pikemen were in high demand. Other famous mercenary groups
include Cossacks, Ronin, and Pirates. <br/><br/>Now, the standard
definition of Mercenaries is given to us by Article 47 of Protocol I of
the 1949 Geneva Convention, which states that mercenaries are neither
combatants nor prisoners of war. Currently, the most popular form of
mercenary is the PMC (Private Military Contractor), which supplies
soldiers to governments to help them guard high profile targets, defend
installations, train local police, and so on. <br/><br/>Bounty Hunters are also still used by bail bondsmen to ensure that their clients go to court when they are supposed to.<br/><br/>Soldier of Fortune Magazine is designed to be read by the mercenary.<br/><br/><font size="2">For more information, read:<br/>Military History Magazine (June 2003): Cossack Pirates in the Black Sea<br/><a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.privatemilitary.org">www.privatemilitary.org</a><br/><a href="http://www.blogger.com/o%09http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/17/spotlight/">CNN Special on Mercenaries</a></font><br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://www.armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[In 1994, President Clinton
prepared to launch an invasion of Haiti (then led by the brutal General
Cedras). The goal was to remove General Cedras and put President
Aristide back into power. The following military preparations were made
(each of these is discussed in depth in the episode):<br/><ul><li>2
Aircraft Carriers containing air support, special operations, and the
10th Mountain Division were afloat just outside of Haiti.</li><li>US Marines were on landing craft ready to land on the island.</li><li>82nd Airborne Paratroopers were at North Carolina Air Base ready to drop into Haiti.</li><li>Navy Seals were prepared to invade and/or were already on the island of Haiti.</li></ul>

Clinton's diplomatic team (consisting of President Jimmy Carter,
General Colin Powell, and Senator Sam Nunn) were sent to Haiti earlier
in the day and managed to get Cedras to step down 30 minutes before the
planned invasion. Operation Uphold Democracy was then initiated to keep
the peace in Haiti.<br/><br/><font size="2">For more information, read:<br/>US Special Forces by Samuel Southworth<br/><a href="http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/where.htm"><font style="text-decoration: underline;">US Carrier Locations</font></a><br/>My Life by Bill Clinton</font> <br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

This collection of quotes on the 5 elements of war (Path, Heaven,
Earth, Leader, and Law) has had a profound impact on military history.&nbsp;
Many of the world's most famous generals have used the book.&nbsp; Likewise,
many of the world's military training schools require the book as
reading.&nbsp; <br/>

Arnold: Conspired to hand West Point over to the British (an action

the American Revolution)</li><li>Aaron Burr: Killed the President
and later conspired to rule over a Western American Empire (which would
have plunged the country into an East-West Civil War)</li><li>John Anthony Walker: Led the Walker Spy Ring which sold ALL of the US war plans during the Vietnam War to the Soviets</li><li>Aldrich
Ames: Revealed to the Soviets the names of ALL the American spies
currently operating in the Soviet Union. Many of them would be killed
as a result.</li><li>Robert Hanssen: Revealed to the Soviets the
location where American leaders would hide in the event of nuclear war.
Also sold the US missile launch plans in the event of a nuclear war.</li></ul>

            <description><![CDATA[Though they are not the only great walls of history, the following four certainly rank high:<br/><ul><li>Great
Wall (Started around 200BC): This wall, which is 25 feet high and 25
feet thick, was built to keep Mongol Invaders out of China. It was
equipped with many watchtowers and smoke signaling systems. However,
this Wonder of the Medieval World is deteriorating due to weather and
American corporate influence. Recently, the wall was cleared by a
skateboarder (The first time a non-motorized vehicle cleared the Wall).</li><li>Hadrians
Wall (Started around 100AD): This wall, which was only 6 yards high,
spanned across the entire width of Britain. It was used by the Romans
to defend against Scottish tribes. The wall was supplanted by Roman
garrisons and forts.</li><li>Maginot Line (Built from 1930-1935):
This line of forts was created along the Franco-German border, in order
to stop an expected German offensive to the West. However, in WWII, the
Germans simply went around the line via the Low Countries. Therefore,
the term Maginot is associated with &quot;something that is relied on but
fails&quot;.</li><li>Atlantic Wall (Built during WWII): This line of
defenses was created by the Germans along the Atlantic Coasts of Norway
and France. It was intended to deter an Allied amphibious invasion of
Fortress Europe. However, the Allies still continued with their attack
and were able to break through at Normandy. However, this massive
collection of defensive tools greatly slowed the Allied advance.</li></ul>

After being a child hostage of the Romans for much of his youth, Attila
would ascend to the throne with this brother Bleda. Attila soon killed
Bleda and took absolute power over the Huns.<br/><br/>Under Attila, the
Huns would constantly raid the outskirts of Byzantine Empire. At one

<ul><li>In the Winter War between the Finns and the Soviets, the Finnish
ski troops used guerilla tactics to stop a much larger enemy.&nbsp; Their
high mobility gave them an advantage in the cold conditions (of which
the Soviets were not used to).</li><li>The 10th Mountain Division, a special operations unit in the US,
is trained in harsh terrain operations, including ski warfare.&nbsp; They
are a rapid-response unit and have conducted many operations in the
1990s.</li></ul>

Bicycle Warfare:<br/>
<ul><li>Bicycles are cheap, light, fast, and can carry a surprisingly large amount of baggage</li><li>When Japan invaded Singapore in WWII, they used bicycles on
gravel and pavement to give the impression of a much larger tank
force.&nbsp; This prompted a British garrison that was 3x the size of the
Japanese invading force to surrender.</li></ul>

            <description><![CDATA[Nuclear
weapons, first created as a result of the Manhattan Project, come in
many forms. The ones dropped on Japan, for example, were plutonium and
uranium atomic bombs which used nuclear fission (breaking a larger
nucleus into two smaller fragments). Hydrogen bombs, on the other hand,
use nuclear fusion (fragments combined into a larger nucleus).<br/><br/>Over
time, nuclear delivery also improved. Early on, only gravity bombs were
used (ex. US bombers circulated around the USSR ready to drop gravity
bombs). However, by the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, rockets and
ballistic missiles were developed to carry warheads.
Submarine-launchable and backpack nukes also exist.<br/><br/>Because the
power of nuclear technology is so great, a policy of Mutually Assured
Destruction has been adopted. In other words, both sides don't launch
nuclear weapons out of fear that the other side will launch their own.<br/><br/>Currently, there are seven countries known to possess nuclear weapons, and two who are thought to possess them.<br/><br/>For more information, read:<br/><font size="2">Physics 6th Edition by Cutnell and Johnson<br/>The Cold War by Mike Sewell<br/><a href="http://www.nuclearfiles.org/">http://www.nuclearfiles.org</a><br/><a href="http://www.thebulletin.org/doomsday_clock/">http://www.thebulletin.org/doomsday_clock/</a><br/><br/></font><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a></font>]]></description>

&quot;screaming eagles&quot;.&nbsp; Their motto is &quot;Rendevous with Destiny&quot;, and they
are officially known as air assault infantry.&nbsp; Their training is one of
the toughest in the Army.<br/>
<br/>
Some of their battles in WWII include: Pathfinding during D-Day,
Operation Market Garden, and the Battle of the Bulge.&nbsp; The division
also participated in the Vietnam War (ex. Hamburger Hill), during
Desert Storm, and during Operation Cobra II (otherwise known as
Operation Iraqi Freedom).<br/>

distinguished career includes the titles of Army Chief of Staff,
5-Start General of the Army, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State,
and aide to General Pershing. He excelled both in the field (earning
various medals and helping to train others during WWI), as a tactical
commander (masterminding the US victory in WWII by emphasizing mass
movement and morale), and as a statesman (engineering the Marshall plan
which would rebuild Europe, as well as increase the US's power in the
heating-up Cold War). <br/><br/>These accomplishments showed through
when he became Time Magazine Man of the Year twice, in 1944 and 1948.

            <description><![CDATA[In the 1800s, the
Ottoman Empire was instructed by both France and Russia to protect
Catholic and Orthodox Christians that were within its empire. These two
instructions conflicted and the Ottomans chose to side with France.
Seeing an opportunity to limit Russian expansion, Britain, Austria and
Prussia also support the &quot;Allies&quot; (France, Ottomans). This angered
Russia and it invaded the Danubian Principalities in 1853, as well as
destroyed the Ottoman Black Sea fleet at the Battle of Sinop.<br/><br/>The
Allies then sent an ultimatum (which was accepted by the Russians) but
didn't stop the attack. They landed on the Crimean Peninsula and began
the Siege of Sevastopol (the Russian naval base). Twice, the Russians
tried to break out, including once at the Battle of Bacalava. This
battle witnessed the famous Charge of the Light Brigade (which ended in
a slaughter of British cavalrymen). Eventually, the Russians
surrendered and the Crimean War ended.<br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a><br/><br/></font>For more information, read:<br/><font size="2">The Guinness Book of Military Blunders by Geoffrey Regan<br/>Military History Magazine (April 2006): Crimean War Siege<br/><a href="http://www.crimeanwar.org/cwrsentry.html">http://www.crimeanwar.org/cwrsentry.html</a><br/><a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/history/crimea/immcauses.html">http://www.victorianweb.org/history/crimea/immcauses.html</a></font>]]></description>

			<title>Urban Warfare at Stalingrad</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Urban_Warfare_at_Stalingrad.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Urban warfare is a
different style of warfare because an enemy could be hiding anywhere,
each house must be cleared out individually, and no powerful weapons
may be used out of fear for collateral damage. However, it is
disadvantageous to use because of the danger it puts your own civilians
in. Despite this, however, many weaker enemies resort to urban warfare
in order to combat a powerful enemy. For this reason, the US has
developed MOUT (Military Operations on Urban Terrain) training.<br/><br/>The
Battle of Stalingrad (1942-43) in WWII is a prime example of urban
warfare. It was initiated due to Operation Barbarossa, the German push
eastward towards Moscow. Stalingrad was a key target due to its
symbolic name and its industrial capacity. Initially, the Russians
under Zhukov were almost completely pushed out of the city by Paulus's
Sixth Army. However, powerful Russian tank, skilled Russian snipers,
and masses of Russian soldiers (whose life expectancy was less than 24
hours) fought back and even surrounded the Germans in Operation Uranus.
Eventually, after a failed rescue attempt by Manstein's German Army,
Paulus surrendered and the Russians won the battle.<br/><br/><font style="font-style: italic;">Military History Podcast is sponsored by <a href="http://armchairgeneral.com/">Armchair General Magazine</a><br/><br/></font>For more information, read:<br/><font size="2">The Dictionary of Battles by David Chandler<br/>The Guinness Book of Military Blunders: Operation Barbarossa by Geoffrey Regan<br/>http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/wwii/stalingrad/default.aspx</font>]]></description>

			<title>Liquid Fire</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Liquid_Fire.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The following are three famous forms of
liquid fire throughout military history in chronological order: Greek
Fire (used at sea), Flame Throwers (used on land), Napalm (used from
the air).<br/><ul><li>Greek Fire: Invented by Callinicus in 673AD, it
was one of the reasons why the Byzantine Empire survived. Impossible to
extinguish, incredibly adhesive, and ignited by water, it was extremely
useful in naval battles and in defending the city of Constantinople.
For these reasons, the Byzantine Empire always tried to keep Greek Fire
their own secret. In 1453, the secret was lost forever and we still
don't know how to replicate it.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>Flame Throwers:
Invented by Richard Fiedler in 1901, the most common form is the
backpack flamethrower. The backpack flamethrower has two canisters: one
for compressed flammable gas, and the other for flammable liquid. They
were used especially in WWII to eradicate Japanese from tunnel systems,
but they are effective against all kinds of fortification. However,
they are extremely dangerous to the user, and only useful in certain
circumstances.</li></ul>
 <ul><li>Napalm: First used in WWII, it was
a key part of air power during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. In
the latter, it was especially useful against entrenched Vietcong; in
the former, it was especially useful against tanks. However, it is
considered an inhumane weapon and in 1980, the UN decreed that it
shouldn't be used against civilians.</li></ul>

			<title>The Ninja - Spy and Assassin</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_Ninja_-_Spy_and_Assassin.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Ninja's, often thought
of as the world's first special forces, were prominent throughout
Japanese warfare in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries. Centered mainly
in the Iga and Koga province, ninjas trained under the supervision of
the shonin (village leader).<br/><br/>In order to enter a home, a ninja
used foldable saws (to break down doors), handclaws (to climb walls),
flotation shoes (to walk across a moat), and disguises (usually as a
yamabushi monk or a zen monk). Contrary to popular opinion, ninjas did
not always dress in black.<br/><br/>Once inside the home, the ninja used
many techniques to move and listen secretly. They used irogome (colored
rice) to leave messages for future ninjas or some other ally. To listen
in on a conversation, ninjas used a small tube that could be used to
listen through walls. Then, to retreat, the ninja used smoke &quot;grenades&quot;
and flash &quot;grenades&quot;. <br/><br/>As for the assassin aspect of ninjas,
their main weapon was a short sword with shuriken (throwing stars)
hidden in the hilt. Other weapons include makibashi (caltrops filled
with poison), a traditional bow, and a shinobi-gama (a sickle with a
chain attached). <br/><br/>There were some female ninjas, although they were used less frequently.<br/><br/>For more information, read<br/><font style="font-weight: bold;">Military History Magazine (March 2006): Intrigue (Ninjas)  </font>and   <p class="MsoNormal" style="font-weight: bold;"><a href="http://www.taots.co.uk/content/view/31/27/">http://www.taots.co.uk/content/view/31/27/</a><br/></p>

			<title>King Shaka Zulu</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/King_Shaka_Zulu.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Shaka was born to a Zulu chief and a lower-class woman named Nandi. Throughout his life, Shaka would care for Nandi and was greatly affected by her death in 1827 (when he killed thousands of Nandi's subjects so that he would have people to mourn with him). Early on, Shaka became the "apprentice" of Chief Dingiswyao, a great military leader. After proving himself as a soldier, he was eventually allowed to become military chief of the Zulus.

As military chief, he created three new tactics:

    * Shaka used short iklwa stabbing spears instead of long assegai throwing spears. This showed how Shaka used close combat effectively throughout his campaigns.
    * Shaka created a buffalo formation which consisted of the chest, the two horns (flanking forces), and the loins (reserve forces).
    * Shaka forced all the people he conquered to join his force or die. This policy of assimilation made his army grow rapidly.

Shaka's two great wars were both fought against the Ndwandwa tribe, led by Chief Zwide. During the first war, Shaka defeated a much larger force under Nomahlanjana by fighting off several assaults at the top of Qokli Hill. During the second war, Shaka defeated an enemy force under Soshangane at a river crossing and in a plain.

Just before his assassination, Shaka's Zulu nation spanned 2 million square miles consisting of 250,000 citizens and 40,000 soldiers. He had killed around 2 million enemy soldiers during his campaigns.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Alexander_the_Great_-_Part_Two.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Alexander then met Darius at Issus, where he again defeated a much larger Persian Army. In the course of this battle, Alexander captured Darius' family, including Queen Stateira (who would later die in capitivity), and his daughter (the most beautiful woman in the world).

For the next few years, Alexander captured Egypt and several port cities including Tyre.

Eventually, Alexander headed eastward and defeated Darius for the last time at Gaugamela. Darius, however, managed to get away, but was later killed by his brother Bessus. Soon after this battle, Alexander met King Porus of India at the Hydaspes River. Alexander defeated King Porus, but this battle discouraged his men from fighting any longer.

After a long trek, which resulted in 3/4 of his men dying, Alexander returned to Babylon where he was either killed or assassinated. After his death, his kingdom was split into three regions under the Antigonids, the Seleucids, and the Ptolemies.

            <description><![CDATA[Alexander, who was destined to be great since before he was born, ascended to the Macedonian Throne at the age of 20 after his father, Philip, was murdered. After regaining control of Greece, Alexander crossed the Hellespont into Asia Minor to liberate Greeks and to defeat the Persians.

Alexander first met Darius of Persia at the Battle of Granicus River, where he defeated the much larger Persian Army with his phalanxes. Alexander almost died in this battle. After he routed the Persians, Alexander slaughtered 18,000 Greek mercenaries, in order to punish them for helping the enemy. Throughout the rest of his campaign, Alexander would show himself to be brutal towards his enemies.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Military_Medicine.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Medicine has been used in the military since 1274BC in the Battle of Kadesh (Egyptians vs. Hittites), and 400BC by Hippocrates, the father of medicine. However, field hospitals and medical care on the frontlines is a fairly recent invention (around 1492 by the Spanish and the Moors). Since then, there have been major innovations in every major war:

    * Napoleonic Wars: Larrey, Napoleon's chief surgeon, creates the "flying ambulance", the idea of amputation, and the policy of treating wounded according to severity of injuries, not rank.
    * 1864 Geneva convention: Red cross adopted as military medicine emblem
    * World War I: The RAMC (royal army medical corps) invents a three zone-system for collection, evacuation and distribution. They also categorize the wounded into less-serious, serious, and hopeless.
    * World War II: Medics become integrated into fighting units. Medics also have access to morphine and plasma.
    * Korean War: MASH units are created to serve as mobile field hospitals.
    * Vietnam War: Medevac helicopters are used to evacutate the wounded to a hospital in under 2 hours.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Armor_and_Siege_Weapons.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Armor has been used throughout history as a way to siege or breach a stronghold. For example:

    * The Greeks used helepolises, which were massive siege towers with nine stories of catapults, ballistas, and ranged infantry.
    * 2000 years later, another major advancement was made in World War I with the invention of the "tank". This tank (the most famous of which was the Sturmpanzerwagen A7v) had a variety of problems and was introduced too late in the war to be effective.
    * In World War II, tanks were again used in a much more effective way. The Germans used tanks in their blitzkrieg lightning warfare by concentrating them in a small area, and breaching through the enemy lines. Later in the war, the US copied this strategy with their own light Sherman tanks.
    * During the Cold War, the US developed M1 Abrams tanks to counter the Russian T-90s. This tank is still dominant today, although experts believe that it will become obsolete within the next 20 years.

            <description><![CDATA[Erwin Rommel (due to propaganda by Goebbels) was considered a hero to both the allies and the axis. "Only Napoleon had made a comparable impression on the British" -BH Lidell Hart. The following are major eras in his life:

    * WWI: As a junior officer, Rommel became the youngest man to win the Pour le Merite (the most prestigious award in the German Army) for his actions at the Battle of Longarone.
    * Between the Wars: Rommel wrote Infantry Attacks and Tank Attacks. This greatly impressed Hitler, and eventually led to gaining more power in the Army.
    * WWII (France): Led the 7th Panzer Divison (also known as the Ghost Divison) in a mad dash towards the Atlantic in the initial battle to conquer France.
    * WWII (Africa): Led the Afrika Korps in roller coast campaign across north Africa, the southern flank of Europe. He was finally defeated at the Battle of El Alamein.
    * WWII (Atlantic Wall): Submitted a plan for the defense of Europe which was tragically disregarded by the German command.
    * Rommel is suspected of plotting to assassinate the Fuhrer. Hitler forces him to commit suicide.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Roman_Fighting_Tactics.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
Roman military tactics (which revolved around heavy infantry) can be divided up into two distinct periods: before the Marius reforms, and after the Marius reforms (around 100BC).

    * Pre Marius: In each legion, there would be dozens of maniples consisting of around 120 men each. The heavy infantry of a legion would contain hastati, princeps, and triarii. They would be supported by velites skirmishers, and their flanks would be protected by equites cavalry. The tortoise, hamstringing, the wedge, and vastatio were some of the tactics used at this time,
    * Post Marius: The basic unit of the military became an enlarged maniple. Now, instead of three distinct heavy infantrymen, they were simply called legionaries. Auxilaries (non-Romans trying to gain citizenship) also played an important support role.

            <description><![CDATA[The Mongols, nomads from the Steppes (north of China), were first united by Genghis Khan in 1206. Genghis Khan led the Mongols across Eurasia via innovative and effective military tactics.

    * The Mongols were oriented around extreme mobility. They carried their houses with them, drank their own horse's blood to stay alive, and could travel up to 100 miles per day.
    * The Mongols had an elaborate priority-mail-system which allowed orders to be transmitted rapidly across Eurasia.
    * Genghis Khan used combined fake retreats with accurate Manguadai Horse Archers to pick off his European enemies.
    * Genghis Khan slaughtered a few cities, in an attempt to scare all other cities to surrender without a fight. He, being a practical leader, also valued smarts more than bravery.

            <description><![CDATA[Smedley Butler, also known as "The Fighting Quaker" or "Old Gimlet Eye", was an outspoken member of the Marine Corps in the early part of the 20th century. He served in many parts of the world including Central America, the Caribbean, and the Far East. His many acts of heroism include:

    * Tientsin: Butler and five other men carried a wounded officer 17-miles through heavy fire to get the officer medical attention. The four enlisted men in the group were award the Medal of Honor (officers were ineligible).
    * Veracruz: Butler became one of the 56 men awarded the Medal of Honor for service in occupying Veracruz, Mexico.
    * Haiti: Butler led a counterattack against a numerically superior number of Cacos Rebels. He also led an assault into a Cacos rebel fortress, earning him his second medal of honor.
    * Butler exposed a coup (proposed by industrialists and bankers), thereby preserving FDR's presidency.

            <description><![CDATA[The following four topics are all stands by the US military. This is just a small selection of famous stands since there are many more (some of which will be mentioned in a future episode).

    * Alamo (1836): Lt. Col. Travis leads the Texian defense of the Alamo against a numerically superior foe, the Mexicans led by Santa Anna. The Texians cannot hold and every male is killed.
    * Little Bighorn (1876): Lt. Col. Custer underestimates the Lakota/Cheyenne forces in the area (under the leadership of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull). Custer is overwhelmed and all of his men are killed.
    * Khe Sanh (1968): The US military base near the border of North and South Vietnam is besieged by numerically superior NVA forces. Using heavy bombers, the US troops break the siege and damage the NVA significantly.
    * Mogadishu (1993): Operation Restore Hope in Somalia suffers a major defeat when special forces groups executing "Operation Gothic Serpent" are trapped in the city. After a horrendous night of fighting, they are rescued by UN forces.

            <description><![CDATA[The Battle of Pharsalus was fought in Greece in 48BC. The two combatants were Caesar and Pompey, the two greatest generals of the Roman Republic (they were also the last).

Despite Rome being famous for its invulnerable legions, the battle was decided by cavalry. More specifically, Caesar won the battle after he defied Pompey's massive cavalry charge.

Caesar then proceeded to become dictator for life of Rome, consequently starting the Roman Empire.

            <description><![CDATA[The Romans were, without a doubt, the most dominant force in the Western Mediterranean throughout most of their history. However, these titans still had their share of catastrophic defeats. The four most notable being:

    * Battle of Lake Trasimene (217BC): Hannibal, being pursued by Flaminius of Rome, hides in the forests to the north of Lake Trasimene. He then ambushes Flaminius, surrounds him, and easily defeats him.
    * Battle of Cannae (216BC): Hannibal proves that superior tactics can make up for inferior numbers. Hannibal, using a pincer motion, surrounds the slow Roman forces and slaughters them.
    * Battle of Arausio (105BC): Boiorix of the Cimbri takes advantage of the two un-cooperative Roman commanders and easily defeats them.
    * Battle of Teutoberg Forest (9AD): Ariminus of the Germans conducts many hit-and-run attacks on the Romans until every single one of their 24,000 man force is dead.

            <description><![CDATA[The Battle of Chaldiran was fought in northwestern Persia in 1514. It was fought between the Ottomans (dominant Sunni Muslims from Turkey) and the Safavids (inexperienced Shiite Muslims from Persia). The Ottomans, who had both a numerical advantage and a technological advantage, easily won the battle. However, they chose not to continue the campaign into the Safavid capital.

After this battle, the Ottomans experienced a short period of growth, followed by centuries of decline. They were eventually defeated in WWI.

As for the Safavids, they experienced a long period of growth until they too were finally overcome by Afghan clans in 1722.

            <description><![CDATA[The Gulf War (lasting from 1990-1991) began when Iraq invaded its neighbor Kuwait.  This was the second invasion launched by Iraq in the past decade, with the first being the Iran-Iraq War.  It can be divided into four phases:

    * Desert Shield: Buildup of US and coalition troops in Saudi Arabia
    * Desert Storm: Incredibly successful air strike on key Iraqi missile installations and SCUD missile launchers.  The Smart Bomb became a keynote image of this phase.
    * Desert Sabre: A tank charge through Kuwait and into Iraq.  The US M1A2 Abrams tanks encountered little opposition.
    * Desert Farewell: A withdrawal of coalition troops after securing the independence of Kuwait.

            <description><![CDATA[
Cyrus the Great, though he did not found the First Persian Empire, did conduct four expeditions which made it the sole power in the Middle East and Anatolia. His empire would last for the next 200 years until the coming of Alexander the Great. The four campaigns were:

   1. Conquering Media: With the help of Harpagus, Cyrus invaded Media currently ruled by Astyages. Astyages was his grandfather and his attempted-murderer.
   2. Conquering Lydia: Cyrus conquers Sardis, the capital of the Lydian Empire (under the rule of Croesus). After the Lydian Empire fell, Croesus became an adviser to Cyrus.
   3. Conquering Assyrians: Cyrus conquered Babylon, the capital of the Assyrian Empire. He entered the city via draining the Euphrates River.
   4. Conquering the Massegatai: Cyrus attempted to conquer Queen Tomyris of the Massegatai (a Scythian Tribe), but was tragically killed by a volley of arrows

            <description><![CDATA[The Battle for Iwo Jima, "sulfur island" of the Pacific, was a battle between the elite US marines and the stout-hearted Japanese defenders.  The Japanese, after years of preparation, had created an extensive tunnel network that prevented them from being hurt by the naval bombardment. 

Consequently, when the Fifth Amphibious Corps (VAC) landed, they had to fight 22,000 well-entrenched Japanese, complete with banzai charges and other intimidating tactics.  In the end, the US death toll was 10% and the Japanese death toll was 99% (with the other 1% being captured).

            <description><![CDATA[
Non-lethal technology has always been a goal of military strategists. It provides the same effect of killing without all the horrible consequences (ethical, tactical, etc.). For example, Joshua's capture of Jericho in the bible is a prime example of non-lethal technology.

Now, we have various methods of non-lethal warfare, both anti-personell and anti-material.

    * Lasers: Used to give the illusion of imminent death
    * Electromagnetic Pulse Weapons: Disables all electronic equipment in a given radius
    * A weapon that "turns off" all guns in its vicinity
    * Insect Sex Pheromones: Attracts all nearby insects to infest a certain enclosure
    * Netgun: Fires a strong net to disable people or vehicles, also serves as an obstacle
    * Acoustics: Vibrations caused from sound waves have many devastating effects

            <description><![CDATA[Christendom, the most powerful domain in the world for the past 1500 years, was frequently permeated and even brought to the brink of ruin many times. Three of these "close calls" include:

    * Battle of Tours (732AD): Charles the Hammer of Franks vs. Abd er Rahman of Moors in France
    * The Golden Horde (1230sAD): Batu Khan invades Eastern Europe, plans to invade Germany
    * Siege of Vienna (1529AD): Suleiman II of Ottomans vs. Charles II of Austrians at Vienna

Each of these events could have ended Christendom prematurely and stunted important ages such as the Renaissance, Industrial Revolution, as Imperialism.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The First Persian War includes the Persians being defeated by the Athenians at the Battle of Marathon. The Persians started this war out of anger for the Athenians and their support of the Ionian Revolt. This battle is also where we get the name for our modern-day Olympic Game: The Marathon.

The Second Persian War includes the famous Greek stand at Thermopylae, the brilliant Athenian naval victory at Salamis, and the catastrophic Persian defeat at the Battle of Plataea. Following this war, the Persians would not reenter Greek affair until briefly in the Peloponnesian Wars. This also set the stage for Alexander the Greats conquering of Persia in the 4th century BC.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[
Biological warfare has been a part of war since 1,000 BC when the Chinese burned toxic vegetables and hoped the fumes would travel towards the enemy.  Since that time, biological warfare has become dealier and more precise, yet there is always the risk of collateral damage.

In the past few decades, world powers have worked to outlaw biological weaponry for their gruesome effects and their "unfairness" in war.  However, biological warfare continues to be a threat both in war, and at home.]]></description>

They are trained to camouflage themselves, shoot a high-ranking enemy soldier, and extract themselves from the area without the enemy ever knowing they were there.

Snipers have a unique mindset in that they are highly solitary, must stay in the same position for hours, and must be able to kill an enemy without even giving them a chance.  For these reasons, snipers have earned their fair share of medals and recognition.]]></description>

			<title>Gladiatorial Combat</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/Gladiatorial_Combat.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Ever since 326BC, the Romans have been conducting gladiatorial fights, originally for funerals, and later for pure entertainment. Gladiators are highly disciplined slaves trained at ludi. At one point, their excellent fighting ability posed a threat to Rome itself.

There were various types of gladiators including the essedari (charioteers) and retiarii ("the fisherman") that fought animals or each other. Sometimes, these gladiators were loaded on to two boats and naval battles were conducted.

Although the practice died down by 500AD, gladiatorial combat kept the Roman people happy and is a staple of Roman society.]]></description>

			<title>The Great Escape</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/5_The_Great_Escape.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In 1944, Allied airmen interned at Stalag Luft III (the supposedly escape-proof POW camp run by the Luftwaffe) performed the greatest prison escape in history. Masterminded by Roger Bushell of the RAF, the prisoners used everything at their disposal to mask their escape operations. In the end, they created a tunnel 30 feet deep, 336 feet long, and 87 prisoners managed to escape.

Eventually, all but 3 escapees were recaptured or murdered by the Gestapo at Hitler's orders. A few dozen prisoners and history books are all that remains of this great escape from Stalag Luft III.]]></description>

			<title>Hannibal is at the Gates</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/geo47/The_Second_Punic_War.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Hannibal Barca, commander-in-chief of Carthage during the Second Punic War, is famous for crossing the Alps with his entire army (which included War Elephants) in an attempt to invade Rome from the north. He also displayed military genius countless times by outsmarting and slaughtering the greatest soldiers in the world, the Roman legions, at the Battles of Cannae, Trebbia, and Ticino.

Later in the Second Punic War, Hannibal was recalled back to Carthage where he fought the Battle of Zama against Scipio of the Romans. Although he lost the battle and ended his life in shame, Hannibal was still respected in the Roman World (hence the phrase "Hannibal is at the Gates", which was used by mothers as a threat against misbehaving children).

			<title>Valor in the Ancient World</title>

            <description><![CDATA[Today, awards like the Medal of Honor are presented to warriors who display valor on the battlefield. However, thousands of years ago in the Ancient World, there were no official medals. In no way does this mean that there was a shortage of valor. Far from it.

    * Leonidas I of Sparta, for example, led 300 Spartans against 10,000 Persians and managed to hold them off for days.
    * Mucius Scaevola saved the city of Rome via burning off his own hand
    * Horatius Cocles held the entire Etruscan army at Sublican bridge

			<title>Retiring the M16</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://geo47.libsyn.com/retiring_the_m16]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The M16 rifle and its 3 variants (the M16A1, M16A2, and M4 carbine) have been the standard rifle for the US Armed Forces since 1957, almost 50 years! Although it was off to a shaky start, it has earned its "dynasty" status.

Now, as we approach 2006, the US is about to replace the M16 family with the new XM family of weapons. This family includes the XM-8 (which will replace the current M16A2) and the XM-29 (which will replace the current M4 carbine as the special-ops weapon).]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Throughout History, canines have been a vital element of warfare. In the early days of the Roman Empire, almost 2000 years ago, dogs were outfitted with armor and trained to attack the enemy. Great leaders like Fredrick the Great and Napoleon have also used wardogs in their military operations. And more recently, in the Civil War, WWI, WWII, and the Vietnam War, individual dogs have become so courageous that they have been reccomended for the Silver Star and countless Purple Hearts.

However, the wardog has become obsolete in the past few decades with the invention of superior weaponry and tactics. But still, organizations like "The National War Dogs Memorial Project" are trying to preserve K-9 history.]]></description>
