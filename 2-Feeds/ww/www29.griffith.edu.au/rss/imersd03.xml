      <title>Final Drinks</title>
      <link>http://www29.griffith.edu.au/</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>About the Band: The band GPMR came together to record a song co-written by Gaye Pegler and Wade Gregory, Final Drinks.  As well as having an exquisite voice, vocalist Megan Radford was a clear choice to sing Gaye’s words for a personal reason: Megan’s mother Margaret lost her battle with cancer in late 2005, Gaye in early 2006. With luscious strings by Youka Snell and Rani Jeong, and compassionately supported by Tom Flenady’s bass and Joel Hardy’s flugelhorn, GPMR were honored to be working in such professional and inspiring surroundings. They hope that the sum of all these parts come together to allow Gaye’s final words to shine, and to pay tribute to the memories of Gaye Pegler and Margaret Radford.</p><p>About the Song: Final Drinks is a song inspired by the words of Gaye Pegler. Diagnosed with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) in 2000, Gaye wrote a reflective poem whilst sitting with husband Michael at Mooloolaba beach several years into her illness. She passed these words onto her friend Wade Gregory, and together they composed Final Drinks. Gaye lost her long battle with cancer in early 2006, and felt truly blessed to have had a song in which to express herself.</p>]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Phunk Shui is here! And they’re set to have a major impact on the Australian funk fusion scene. Based in Brisbane, their unique style of fusion draws as much from Jazz and Latin influences as it does from Funk and Hip-Hop. One of Phunk Shui’s greatest strengths is that all it’s members bring something exciting and different to the music.  Right from the start, the combination of Cleon’s jazz piano with Ben’s funk bass formed the basis of the Phunk Shui ‘sound’.  However, due in no small part to the addition of Luke and Gabriel, that ‘sound’ has evolved into something special.</p><p>Individually the members of this four piece unit have no shortage of experience having played with acts as diverse as The New York Opera, The National Radio Big Band Orchestra of Bucharest, La Gran Salsa, Gorgonzolla, Phoebus, and Glockenspiel. This is just the beginning for Phunk Shui, who are currently preparing material for they’re debut album. However, if you just can’t wait to hear them, you can catch Phunk Shui at one of their local gigs. Check Phunk Shui.net for details and watch this space!</p>]]></description>
