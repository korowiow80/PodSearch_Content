            <description><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Chen began the mutech degree in 2008, and since then has landed on several different interests, namely band arranging, sampling found sounds, music 2.0 ideologies, songwriting, beat-making, gigging, press and public relations and artist management. "This mutek program is not only showing me the skills to be a better musician or engineer, but also inspiring me to dive into the real-world of public relations, artist management, audio industries and other full-on music business professions."</p>

<p>This indie R&B piece is "a song about writing a song" and is from Andrew's debut album (released in September 2009). It represents a "DIY bedroom recording" production aesthetic, where Andrew has performed all the voices and instruments and collected all the "found sounds," crafting the mix using Apple's Logic software. Mastering was done by mutek alumni Dominic McGlinn.</p>]]></description>

As well as having an exquisite voice, vocalist Megan Radford was a clear choice to sing Gaye’s words for a personal reason: Megan’s mother Margaret lost her battle with cancer in late 2005, Gaye in early 2006. With luscious strings by Youka Snell and Rani Jeong, and compassionately supported by Tom Flenady’s bass and Joel Hardy’s flugelhorn, GPMR were honored to be working in such professional and inspiring surroundings. They hope that the sum of all these parts come together to allow Gaye’s final words to shine, and to pay tribute to the memories of Gaye Pegler and Margaret Radford.</p><p>About the Song: Final Drinks is a song inspired by the words of Gaye Pegler. Diagnosed with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) in 2000, Gaye wrote a reflective poem whilst sitting with husband Michael at Mooloolaba beach several years into her illness. She passed these words onto her friend Wade Gregory, and together they composed Final Drinks. Gaye lost her long battle with cancer in early 2006, and felt truly blessed to have had a song in which to express herself.</p>]]></description>
