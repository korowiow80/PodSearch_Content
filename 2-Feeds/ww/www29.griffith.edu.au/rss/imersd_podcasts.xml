        <description>'Behind the Music' presents intimate insights from leading musicians into what happens ‘behind the scenes’ as they prepare their art. In music performance, technology, composition, education and research, creative activities are often a response to musical questions arising directly from their artistic practice.  These presentations offer a valuable opportunity to reveal a range of creative processes as artists share their personal approaches to such issues. </description>

<p>The Passion of Friedemann Bach.</p>

<p>Because we are uncertain what is of value we are uncertain about what should be taught. Not long ago a musical education was a classical music (Blake, 2010) education. More recently a jazz education has been an alternative. Now as pop is the subject of serious study the entertainment business is collapsing under the strain of piracy, self-production and self-promotion, and the remix culture spoken of by Lessig (2001). Should the first thing taught now be how to produce a video and upload it to youtube? Followed by how to set up myspace and facebook pages? Before moving on to mastering garageband? What of scales, arpeggios, harmony and tonality? Aren't these the basics of music? Well no, they weren't found carved on stone tablets. They were the subjects of vigorous debate in the 18th century, another time when who paid, who played, on what, who listened, where, why and what it might mean were up for grabs. These questions about music are fundamental and provocative.</p>

<p>In spite of his father's peerless investment in him as a musician, Friedemann Bach, Sebastian's favourite, eldest, and most talented son ended up unable to make a living during this period. Why?</p>]]></description>

<p>Intercultural music, although divergent in nature, sits on a parallel platform of significance in today’s climate of globalisation. An intercultural stance in creating electroacoustic music can offer a unique opportunity to fuse tradition and technology and delve into a deeper understanding of the world. It can foster a stronger dialogue at a time where an awareness and understanding of international cultures is becoming imperative. Intercultural electroacoustic music has the capacity to provide a framework for collaboration that can contribute to preserving and exposing rich music traditions across the globe and promote the infinite possibilities of electroacoustic music to a global audience. It can be disseminated in an accessible manner and underpin the current desire for cultural exchange and understanding.  </p>

<p>This seminar explores the creative process of Leah Barclay’s recent intercultural collaborations including Uruvam in India, Juxtapose in South Korea and Cypress Trilogy in Australia.</p>]]></description>

<p>Robert Davidson is the founder, artistic director and bassist of Topology, a leading contemporary classical band. He studied composition with Terry Riley in the US and worked as a bassist in the Australian Opera, Sydney Symphony and Queensland Symphony before commencing an academic career at QUT and now UQ as a music lecturer. His work often focuses on the boundaries between language and music.</p>

<p>Recorded sound and images have remarkable power to effect a kind of time travel. Fascinated by this property, Davidson makes music that integrates archival images and sounds, particularly recorded speech. In "Australians", he creates "voice portraits" which provide musical frames for the inherent and individually distinctive melodies and rhythms found in the spoken intonation of eminent Australians from Kingsford-Smith to Fiona Stanley. These works draw on the oral history archives of the National Library of Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive. Davidson will explain and demonstrate his approaches in this talk.</p>]]></description>

<p>Diabelli's massive commissioning project of variations on his waltz from 50 composers came to fruition in 1823.  The fascinating kaleidoscope of inventive techniques and textures offers intriguing insights into many composers who warrant further investigation.  The innocuous theme also inspired Beethoven’s final monumental piano work.  This presentation examines some questions that arise: the notion of collaborative composition, the question of performance practice in a work that rests virtually unacknowledged in the shadow of the ‘canon’, and the ways that artistic coherence can be imbued into such a diverse creative concept.  An original piano of the period is featured.</p>]]></description>

<p>Where East and West collide  - the music of Kim Cunio.
<br />What happens when two opposing worlds collide in a composer, that of traditional devotional music that is learned and performed orally, and the world of writing music for a living that naturally leads to music being created for functional as well as aesthetic reasons. Cunio's music attempts to reconcile these two worlds; notation and oral tradition are equal partners alongside technology and the processes of recording and producing music. This lecture looks the compositions contained in the following projects: Music of the Dead Sea Scrolls (Art Gallery of NSW and Israeli Department of Antiquities 2000), Buddha Realms (ABC 2002), Ishq (Art Gallery of NSW (2007) and The Thread of Life (Foundation for Universal Sacred Music 2006).</p>

<p>Bringing Reflexive Writing and Personal Storytelling to the Creative Arts.
<br />Autoethnography is an autobiographical genre that connects the personal to the musical, cultural, social, and political. In this lecture, Professor Ellis explores how to bring this personal storytelling approach into music and the creative arts more broadly.</p>

<p>Professor Ellis is one of the world's leading experts on autoethnography. She has published four books—Fisher Folk: Two Communities on Chesapeake Bay; Final Negotiations: A Story of Love, Loss, and Chronic Illness; The Ethnographic I: A Methodological Novel about Autoethnography, and Revision: Autoethnographic Reflections on Life and Work—as well as four edited collections, and more than one hundred articles, chapters, essays, and autoethnographic stories. She has served as President of Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction and chair of two divisions of national organizations, "The Ethnography Division" of National Communication Association and "The Emotions Section" of American Sociological Association.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Visions for Virtual Music: How the Web Got Wired for Sound</b></p>

<p>Visiting Senior Fulbright Specialist William Duckworth presents his views on the future of web-based music making. He is well positioned to do so: a decade ago, on June 10th, 1997, he and media artist Nora Farrell created Cathedral, the first on-going interactive work of music and art online. Featuring the PitchWeb -a custom-designed multi-user virtual instrument that allows global site visitors to perform with each other online and live in concert with the Cathedral Band- their work blurs the boundaries between composer, performer, and audience.</p>

<p>Today, Duckworth and Farrell are developing iOrpheus. a public opera for the promenades of the South Bank Parklands on 31 August 2007. With tableaus of the central moments of the Orpheus legend appearing and reappearing in various unexpected locales, iOrpheus is an undertaking that explores the artistic transformation of scale, as it progresses from in the ear, to in concert, to in the streets.</p>

<p>In his Twilight Lecture, Duckworth will discuss his work online, touching on the concepts of distributed composition, and collective creative processes of present and future. The lecture will also include a display of the sights and sounds of Cathedral, a behind the scenes look at the iOrpheus development, and a brief journey through early sounds online when, for music, the Web was the new frontier.</p>

Surviving the 'double cultural cringe' from the northern hemisphere and the southern states has nevertheless been a significant subtheme attached to this journey, with mixed and at times interesting and unexpected results. This talk will be much more than a trip down memory lane, but inevitably some of the more interesting and under acknowledged aspects of the Conservatorium's story will be brought to light.</p>]]></description>

Free Improvisation - thought by many to be a rarefied and abstract art form - is simply misunderstood.

            <description><![CDATA[Professor Erica McWilliam. (11/04/2006)

Recent educational scholarship draws attention to problems that arise for young people when performance goals are pursued to the exclusion of learning goals. This flies in the face of the idea that learning and performing are a neat complementary set. Erica McWilliam's presentation will explore the links between learning, 'unlearning' and performance, using ideas about pedagogy that are in many respects counterintuitive. This includes challenging the idea that good teachers provide clear explanations, minimise errors and pay close personal attention to their students.]]></description>
