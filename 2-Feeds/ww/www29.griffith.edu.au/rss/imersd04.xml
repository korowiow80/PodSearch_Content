            <title>Across the Pacific - New Music for Piano, Violin and Percussion - 31st March 2010</title>
            <link>http://www29.griffith.edu.au/radioimersd/content/view/238/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Scraping chairs, porcelain bowls, prepared piano and car drum-brakes were just a few of the instruments featured in “Across the Pacific: New Music for Piano, Percussion and Violin.” Performed by Anna Grinberg on piano, Graeme Jennings on violin and Vanessa Tomlinson on percussion, the concert showcased chamber music works from composers …across the pacific. Commencing with a forty minute trio work from 1992, “Schtyx” is an instrument-specific work by Alvin Curran that recycled it’s melodies, launched cardboard boxes full of sampled objects across the room and asked the violins to howl at the moon. Composed by Anthony Moles in 2008, “Trigger” referred to the mechanisms of the instruments used in the work as they are ‘triggered’ by a striking action.  The final piece, “Varied Trio” from 1986, was composed by Lou Harrison and comprised of four movements. Features of note include the porcelain bowls of the second movement and the melodic style even prevalent throughout the percussion. </p>

            <itunes:summary>Scraping chairs, porcelain bowls, prepared piano and car drum-brakes were just a few of the instruments featured in “Across the Pacific: New Music for Piano, Percussion and Violin.” Performed by Anna Grinberg on piano, Graeme Jennings on violin and Vanessa Tomlinson on percussion, the concert showcased chamber music works from composers …across the pacific. Commencing with a forty minute trio work from 1992, “Schtyx” is an instrument-specific work by Alvin Curran that recycled it’s melodies, launched cardboard boxes full of sampled objects across the room and asked the violins to howl at the moon. Composed by Anthony Moles in 2008, “Trigger” referred to the mechanisms of the instruments used in the work as they are ‘triggered’ by a striking action.  The final piece, “Varied Trio” from 1986, was composed by Lou Harrison and comprised of four movements. Features of note include the porcelain bowls of the second movement and the melodic style even prevalent throughout the percussion.

            <link>http://www29.griffith.edu.au/radioimersd/content/view/235/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A new realisation of the music of Hildegard of Bingen. Hildegard of Bingen was an undoubted visionary. She had transcendental experiences throughout her life, and these experiences informed her worship and her sense of the world. In the medieval environment, it was seen as possible to have a direct link with the angels and the holy spirit; and it is this sense of wonder that The Sacred Fire seeks to explore.</p>

<p>In the last decade there have been many recordings of the music of Hildegard, ranging from the historically informed works of ensembles such as Sequentia, to a number of adventurous fusion recordings that have sought to combine this wonderful music with all sorts of modern sounds. The Sacred Fire is both of these. It is faithful in a historical sense, but is also musically adventurous. This is not the flippant adventure of those who combine a keyboard or hastily composed chord scheme with the original music, but the result of an exacting realisation process.</p>

<p>A meeting of members of the original ABC commission (Kim Cunio, Heather Lee, Tunji Beier, Rebbecca Frith), with members of the Queensland Conservatorium, Vanessa Tomlinson, Nicholas Ng and Jan Baker Finch. Each member has a varied and wonderful international career.</p>

Copland's vivid setting of In The Beginning for a'capella chorus and mezzo soprano soloist is rarely performed, while Bloch's Sacred Service is also not well known in Australia. Choral textures combine with a small ensemble of winds and brass for Stravinsky's unique setting of the traditional Mass text.

This program prominently features the Viennese waltz style, opening with one of the genre's great masterpieces, Johann Strauss' "Emporer Waltz", and concluding with Richard Strauss' "Rosenkavalier Suite". Juxtaposed to this music in three-four time is the Prelude to "Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg", a powerful statement in marching style by Wagner who influenced all subsequent composers, including most notably Richard Strauss. Performing in the newly arranged suite from "Der Rosenkavalier" will be three outstanding Conservatorium alumni singing some of the opera's most famous scenes. Doctoral student Armin Terzer will perform Strauss' brilliant second concerto for French Horn.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This program commemorates the 250th anniversary of Handel's death with a suite from his Water Music. Haydn makes another appearance this season with one of his last symphonies, the so-called "Drum Roll". Prize-winning Conservatorium student Maxine Byrne will be heard in one of the finest French concertos for the flute, composed by Andrew Jolivet. Prokofiev's First Symphony is nicknamed "Classical" because of its early 20th Century resonances with Haydn - in fact it was one of the first 'new-classical' works in a twentieth century context - a truly sparkling finale for this concert.</p>

This is the second time they have performed at Jazz Cafe and this time their set entirely consisted of reinterpretations of jazz standards, many of them ballads. </p>

<p>Every year Conservatorium students have the opportunity to compete for a solo appearance with one of our orchestras, and in some years the large number of prizewinners enables us to present an extra concerto concert. This special event will have a particularly Russian theme, with concertos by Tchaikovsky and Stravinky, complemented by a most intriguing timpani concerto by long-time principal timpanist of the Berlin Philharmonic, Werner Tharichen.  This is a wonderful showcase opportunity for our students in a dazzling evening of solo concertos.</p>]]></description>

<p>One piece is excerpted here - Globokar's 1997 solo percussion work, Pensée écartelée. “Performing Globokar's work brilliantly was percussionist Vanessa Tomlinson, who in Pensée écartelée presented a performance that would have made Animal from the Muppet Show proud.” – Die Presse, Vienna.</p>

<p>The project was based on the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice and written for and with the Brisbane South Bank precinct. The performance was a 2.5 hour event, enacted as a series of encounters with the central moments of the Orpheus legend appearing and reappearing in various unexpected locales within the parklands. This public opera created guided moments where park visitors—using their everyday digital devices—could interact artistically with parallel worlds as they move through the events of their daily lives. The performers numbered in the hundreds and consisted of  Conservatorium students, staff and citizens of Brisbane (children and adults).</p>
