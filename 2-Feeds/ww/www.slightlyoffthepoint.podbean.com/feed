<p>Can you really watch two games at once?  Every day is like Saturday for Harry Redknapp.  Jermaine Jenas is ambulatory.  The quickest pitch-side report in history.  How not to silence a partisan home crowd (by letting them score).  Ray Wilkins is a weatherman.  Jamie Redknapp causes Glen Hoddle to blush.</p>

<p>In this installment (an installment worthy of the final itself) we examine RTE&#8217;s interplanetary broadcasting policy, Gypsy Rose Eamo sees all our futures and &#8217;Van Bommel the Barbarian&#8217; parts 13, 14 and 15.</p>
<p>After a match/tournament that &#8216;threw up&#8217; more questions than it answered we have several of our own - Why Was Sting Refereeing the Game? What&#8217;s the Point of Dirk Kuyt?, Who Had Van Persie?, What Ancient Art Form is Favoured by the Spanish as a Means of Communication? (it&#8217;s not mime!) and Who&#8217;s Going to North Korea?</p>
<p>And that would appear to be that - at least until the inevitable best of&#8230;

<p>Then the individuals of Ghana take on the team of Uruguay Liam Brady is revealed as a massive hypocrite, Bill sounds bored after a boring match and a boring shootout and Johnny Giles tries not to swear.</p>
<p>Also today we have an update on the 2010 World Leapfrog Championships which are getting very dangerous.</p>
<p>There are two new slots: Let&#8217;s Rewrite History with Eamon Dunphy and Grammar with Gilesie</p>
<p>A couple of entries in the &#8216;Is This Racist?&#8217; slot and instead of &#8216;Innuendo of the Day&#8217; we have the &#8216;S&amp;M Slot of the Day&#8217;.</p>
<p>Enjoy.

		<itunes:summary>Kickfest 2010 sees Craig Burley turn into Rab C Nesbitt, ITV try and paint the world orange, Lionel Messi play for Brazil (?) and Adrian Chiles demonstrate how he hates children and Liam Brady refusing to collect on a bet for moral reasons...

Then the individuals of Ghana take on the team of Uruguay Liam Brady is revealed as a massive hypocrite, Bill sounds bored after a boring match and a boring shootout and Johnny Giles tries not to swear.

Also today we have an update on the 2010 World Leapfrog Championships which are getting very dangerous.

There are two new slots: Let's Rewrite History with Eamon Dunphy and Grammar with Gilesie

A couple of entries in the 'Is This Racist?' slot and instead of 'Innuendo of the Day' we have the 'S&#x38;M Slot of the Day'.

Enjoy</itunes:summary>
