     Passion is an often times overlooked and under valued quality.  On more than one occasion, the defining moment of a given contest occurred as a result of passion.  So, where does your heart rest?  It was not until these past few months that I have had the right combination of experiences to fully value passion.

Notes &#8211; There's no &quot;I&quot; in team!

By Ernest Shaw, PMP

While it is a fact that there is no &#8220;I&#8221; in team, there definitely is an &#8220;I&#8221; in failure.  Depending upon what your outlook and final desire, that supposed missing &#8220;I&#8221; can become quite significant.  Team building is as much a science as it is an art as there are no absolutes and there are no guarantees.  A team is defined as &#8220;a number of persons associated together in work or activity or as a group on one side.&#8221;   With this definition in mind there really is no room for &#8220;I&#8221;.  While the first impression might be of a cheesy clich&#233;, there is a great deal of truth and power in the that there is no &#8220;I&#8221; in team . . .

How many times have you either heard or said, &#8220;Call me when you get there.&#8221; during the course of your life?  I can tell you for one, if you have kids, at least 200 zillion times!  That statement always seems to come from a situation where someone wants to be made aware of a persons where abouts and time of arrival.  Which is incredibly similar to conveying progress on projects and the associated milestones . . .

Who came up with that saying anyway?  The world may never know however, I know for a fact that it wasn't me!  You hear it everywhere . . . in stores, in political campaigns, and from average Joe's everyday.  As it relates to project management, I see this statement as a declaration, or commitment, to a project once commenced.  It is rare if ever a project of complexity runs from beginning to end without at least one potentially derailing event.  An example of this is the United States Apollo 13 Space Mission and the now infamous words of astronaut Jim Lovell exclaiming, &#8220;Ahh, Houston, we've had a problem.&#8221;

Project management is a skill that we all have and utilize daily on varying levels.  Parenting, mentoring,  charitable serving in religious service, and just plain life in general.  In each of these situations, and life, we each utilize the core project management processes of Initiation, Planning, Execution, Control, and Closure.  It is this daily exercise of the basic processes that allow each of us to ascend to higher levels of project management . . .

     In addition to the technical aspects associated with project management [initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure] leadership is also a skill, which must be developed and mastered.  To some, leadership is the process of determining the direction the crowd is heading, charging to the front and yelling, &quot;This way follow me!&quot;   . . .

     In addition to the technical aspects associated with project management [initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure] leadership is also a skill, which must be developed and mastered.  To some, leadership is the process of determining the direction the crowd is heading, charging to the front and yelling, &quot;This way follow me!&quot;   . . .

     I borrowed this quote and reference because they both effectively summarize success.  To be successful in any endeavor one must understand the process, the players and the positions being played.  In the above quote, there is no distinction for any of the players.  Every morning, it is abundantly clear that all must perform at their best in order to survive.  As I see things, what is true on the great plains of Africa also holds true in the concrete and glass jungle of contemporary business . . .

     While not overtly stated in a project management text that I have read, self-confidence and believing in ones self is a critical attribute for all project managers.   Self-confidence is often times believed to be an innate characteristic of the person displaying such however, that is often times not the case.  Self-confidence can be derived from many means one of which is will.  True statement, we all have the ability to will ourselves  . . .

     It is often said that upwards of 90% of a project manager&#8217;s energy is spent on communications.  90% is a huge portion of ones time however is sensible as most projects involve people which, by default, require communications.  It would be easy if we could just beam thoughts and ideas to our team members however, science hasn&#8217;t quite figured out how to do that just yet.  Still, 90% is a large amount of time and energy to dedicate to any single subject . . .
