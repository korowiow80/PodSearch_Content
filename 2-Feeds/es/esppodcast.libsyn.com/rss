			<title>ESP Tipcast 15: Recovery at what cost?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://esppodcast.libsyn.com/esp-tipcast-15-recovery-at-what-cost]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">On Tipcast 15 we pick up from our discussion on recovery by evaluating when maximal recovery each day hinders maximal training adaptation. By examining training as a stressor with a long-term positive outcome, we can make an informed decision about when to pull out all your tricks. Reviewing the <a href="http://ukpmc.ac.uk/articles/PMC2928513" target="_blank">research</a>, suggests that mitigating the all the &ldquo;Bad&rdquo; of training, like anti-oxidant production, blocks much of the post exercise adaptive process.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">We hope you&rsquo;ll think twice before using:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">Finally we wrap up with tips on when and how to use recovery techniques, particularly those that enhance the response vs. just reduce it. The human body is one of the most sophisticated and adaptive systems on the planet geared for survival. If the adaptive process was all bad we wouldn&rsquo;t have made it out of Africa!</span></p>

			<title>Episode 32: Preparing for triathlon - Swim to T1 with Jay Peluso</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://esppodcast.libsyn.com/episode-32-preparing-for-triathlon-swim-to-t1-with-jay-peluso]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">On this month's podcast we talk about how to get faster from the swim to T1 with Coach <a href="http://www.peluso-law.com/index.php?p=faq" target="_blank">Jay Peluso</a> of <a href="http://pelusoopenwater.com/" target="_blank">Peluso Open Water</a>. The triathlon adage that <em>you can't win the race in the swim but you can definitely lose it </em>makes swimming a critical, but often mis-trained leg of triathlon. Coach Jay breaks down what to do with your first tri coming up, or how to be at your best as the biggest races of the season approach. Learn about the essential tools for swim training and how to finish off your swim for a great T1! Jay takes a very matter of fact approach that is effective and immensely popular here in Richmond, and you won't want to miss out on the interview.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Also on the podcast, I discuss where your training needs to be going into March and we get a first glimpse at my new training wheels, the top notch <a href="http://www.notubes.com/ZTR-Crest-26-Stock-Wheelset-P450C31.aspx" target="_blank">ZTR Crest</a>&nbsp;from <a href="http://www.notubes.com" target="_blank">Stan's No Tubes</a>. I'll reserve my full review for now, but suffice it to say, the Crest are no second rate wheel set. Good enough to race right out of the box and weighing just over 1400 g, you can't beat the performance and value of this wheel! I cannot thank Stan's enough for their support this season and I cannot wait to bury the competition on the MTB.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Finally, be sure to support all our sponsors, including <a href="https://guenergy.com/store/drinks/electrolyte-brew.html" target="_blank">Gu Brew</a> and Gu's newest drink, <a href="https://guenergy.com/store/roctane/ultra-endurance-drink/tropical-fruit.html" target="_blank">Roctane</a>, which will ignite your performance.</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">On the podcast this month, we talk with the founder of the <a href="http://www.kansascyclist.com/links/UrbanKansasCityCommunityOfCycling.html" target="_blank">Urban Kansas City Community of Cycling</a>, <a href="mailto:manlyguy4304@yahoo.com" target="_blank">Kenneth Walker</a>. Ken is longtime cyclist, who is working to build a better, fitter community through cycling. He works to get urban minorities cycling and racing. Ken races himself, and recently saw his saw become Missouri State Road Champion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Also on the podcast, I revisit my training and discuss where you should be in your own training! We have a comparison review of two INOV-8 shoes, as well,&nbsp;</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; font-size: small;">the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: medium; color: #0000ff;"><a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/UK/Product-View-FLite-195.html?L=26" target="_blank"><span color="#4182b8" style="color: #4182b8;">INOV-8 F</span>-Lite 195</a>&nbsp;</span>to the <span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://www.inov-8.com/New/UK/Product-View-XTalon-212.html?L=27" target="_blank">X-Talon 212</a>. <span style="font-size: small;">While a bit like comparing a baking apple to a snacking apple, both are used for trail running, though neither seems ideally suited to the typical trail. The F-LIte is very much an light weight (195 g)&nbsp;</span></span>all-purpose urban assault shoe. It is super comfortable and light, but never seems to find its niche on either the road or trail. On the road they feel "flat" and unlively, on the trail they deliver a tactile awareness, but fall short on responsiveness. However, this last point maybe more personal preference. I think they will offer a suitable alternative to my X-Talons for less aggressive X-Terra courses, and would recommend them for runners looking for a minimalist cross-trainer or a show that will allow for use on the road and trails; a side note, INOV-8 road specific shoes are NOT suited to many of trails due to lack of traction. The F-Lites offer good traction and hold well on wet rocks, but can hold a candle to the X-Talon in either of these areas. As far as trail shoes go, the X-Talon is simply the best shoe I've found. They fit like a glove, almost never cause blisters (which many shoes do on me), stick to almost any surface and give a tactile feel to the trail like no other shoe I've worn. The raised cleats offer an odd, somewhat slow feeling on paved sections, but also protect the feet from stones buy raising the foot off ther ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Trebuchet MS'; -webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 2px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 2px; font-size: small;">My overall&nbsp;<strong><span style="font-size: medium;">rating on the F-Lite is a B</span></strong>, based on what I expected compared to the X-Talon and Road-X shoes I've worn. They are a worthy buy and would work well in a variety of conditions. As for the X-Talons, I&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: medium;"><strong>rate them as an A</strong></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>. </strong><span style="font-size: small;">They are durable (look at both shoes here) and offer superb performance on the trails, and are good enough to use in races with short paved sections. Bottomline, given the choice of free shoes or paying for these, I'll pay.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

Product review on Spider Tech pre-cut shoulder samples

I found that the versitility and durability of the product were exceptional. With strips for nearly every area of the body, its tough to find that variety. Plus the tape comes in a variety of colors. However, the pre-cut strips may not be adequate for all individuals and can be difficult for unskilled hands to apply. Fortunately, they make individual rolls too. So check out the full review!&nbsp;

Training update and how to work through writers block on your plan. Plus tips for those coming back from injury.
Book review 7-11, How an unsung band of American cyclists took on the world-and won

Other notes from the show include our new website coming Jan 1, thanks to Jonathan Hall at flyboxmedia.com and LIMITED COACHING AND TRAINING PROGRAMS.
Finally, keep those EMAILS coming and be entered to win some awesome Rudy Project eyewear!&nbsp;

Music for this podcast was provided by Treadmill Trackstar&nbsp;and included:
I belong to you
Careen the cat
Shouldn't I take
Hands off

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This month's show is jam packed with podcasty goodness! We talk with CTS founder, Lance Armstrong mentor and coach, and possibly the single most influential person in the web-base coaching industry, Chris Carmichael. Also on the podcast, we talk with Paul Craig, president of Rudy Project North America&nbsp;about the company, its history, the new Fluo Helmet and eyewear line&nbsp;and what it means to be the smallest company in the market. This was a great interview on the real world of eyewear!
In addition to the interviews, we review the New Rule of Lifting for Abs by Lou Schuler and Alwyn Cosgrove. The book is anything but an abs only book and a great total body rules book for strength and fitness. We have news and notes, a special announcement, and we feature new music from Treadmill Trackstar's latest album, Leaving Ohio.
As I said, jam packed with podcasty goodness!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It has been a long time since our last podcast, but the light at the end of the tunnel is nearly here! First, we want to send out our deepest regrets to Aldo Sassi's family. I was scheduled to interview Sassi the weekend of his death, but could not reach him. I read the news Monday morning. However, we plan to build on the loss of Sassi's great mind and bring to you amazing guests in 2011, plus some great offers and opportunities from our sponsors.</p>
<p>The Next podcast will be up very soon!</p>]]></description>

			<title>Episode 17: Darcy Norman returns to talk strength training and optimizing performance </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://esppodcast.libsyn.com/episode-17-darcy-norman-returns-to-talk-strength-training-and-optimizing-performance-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[On the final podcast of 2009 co-host Isaac Howe and I chat with Darcy Norman about why, when and how of strength training for endurance performance. We discuss why weight gain concerns over strength training are unfounded, why strength training means far more pumping iron, how to implement your individual program and how strength and the FMS fit into a year-round program. Darcy also gives us the inside scoop on the latest happenings at Team Columbia-HTC; 86 wins don't happen by luck!

We also thank our two biggest supporters, Honey Stinger (www.honeystinger.com) and Rudy Project (rudyprojectusa.com). ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[On our next show we tackle the debate between volume and intensity, address the myth's of training at lactate threshold on the Sixth Sense Analysis (6SA), and welcome our first guest, Dr. Tom Swensen, Associate Professor in Exercise & Sport Sciences at Ithaca College and author on numerous performance related studies.  Swensen will discuss his latest research and to explore the debate between the need for high volume, 'base' endurance training (ET) prior to specific or high intensity interval training (HIT) dispelling much of the prevailing dogma regarding endurance training. Drawing on a slew of recent studies by Paul Laursen, Martin Gibala and Kirsten Burgomaster, we show how very short, explosive interval training can not only match up to ET, but also surpass it!  Moreover, rather than simply argue to forget longer endurance sessions, we explain how to incorporate HIT into your overall program to maximize performance, or even health and fitness.  We will also be featuring the latest music from former Chalk FarM front man, Michael Duff.

			<title>ESP I-POWER PODCAST #4 Show Notes</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://esppodcast.libsyn.com/esp-i-power-podcast-4-show-notes]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Sixth Sense Analysis discussed a paper by de Bruign et al in EJAP showing that by doing a series of 15 maximal breath holds subjects were able to increase EPO levels by 24%, which was on par with exposure to altitude exposure of about 6000 ft.  EPO remained elevated for nearly 5 hrs.  The findings suggest why Hct and Hb levels are higher among free divers.

The off-season: TAKE A BREAK!  You need to stay active and and move into your winter/off-season program, which should include things other than your main sport,like strength training.  Take stock in your have in your "tool box? – your STRENGTHS.  Decide what cost you the most last year, or even the past few years.  Usually there’s 2 or 3 things that pop up.  BAM!  You have your winter focus.
•	12 – 16 weeks focus on these 2 or 3 things and let your schedule dictate your schedule.  If your work schedule doesn't fit the typical training model with Monday as a rest day then use something that does.  Flexible periodization allows you to accommodate disruptions and other problems, where linear is more rigid.
•	Strength training doesn't need to be at the gym.  A home system can work, but either way, use a full range of motion when possible.
•	DON’T FEAR INTENSITY! Shorter intervals can help sprints AND Time trialing/steady efforts like threshold.
Pre-season: 	Taper back strength training, but don’t feel the need to stop altogether.  Plan a few big rides, or even a camp.  These blocks of endurance really help you find your rhythm on the bike. Hammer rides in moderation!  Alternate often!  

In -Season: most of your focus should be placed on honing your fitness, reducing volume before important events and adding volume and reducing intensity when not competing.  This change of pace can really help keep you progressing.  And don’t forget, it’s ok to take a break!

Show concept.

			<title>ESP I Power Podcast 3 Show notes</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://esppodcast.libsyn.com/esp-i-power-podcast-3-show-notes]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[n the latest Podcast we talk about Power Training and its application to an endurance training program. Briefly mentioned in the show is the term Motor Unit, illustrated above. One of the primary reasons for utilizing supplemental (off related to strength) training in addition to specific endurance training is the difficulty in activating 'High Threshold' motor units - these are motor units that are on the high end of power development (ie, fast twitch). They are bigger, but also require more recovery time, whereas endurance motor units, usually more slow twitch fibers, are very durable. Focusing solely on one endurance training neglects the fast motor units, which get smaller and hard to activate, and may even be lost completely with aging, and emphasizes lower power slow units. The phrase "USE IT OR LOSE IT!" takes on a literal meaning here. The program discussed on the show describes a yearly plan like this: OFF-SEASON – 12 weeks (Nov-Jan) PRE-SEASON – 8 weeks (Feb-Mar) IN-SEASON 1 – 12 weeks (Apr-Jun) IN-SEASON 2 – 12 weeks (Jul-Sep) This leaves October open, which is often a ‘gray’ area of the year. However, it’s not a time to do nothing, maybe just nothing structured. A specific block of training might include perhaps a rotating 14 day plan that focuses on two, or maybe three (if off-season) areas but the layout for each period is the same. Case in point: Let’s say sprinting is your week area, but you generally have good sustained power (ie, 5 min) and tend to get better with short attacks, but recovery isn’t always ideal, and you only have one day per week you can ride on the road. Then I might suggest TWO phases, the first focusing on: * ONE heavy weight/power day, ONE Moderate day with an easy trainer ride * ONE LIGHT day with a road ride. * TWO short interval days. The second cycle would have: * ONE HEAVY lift day * ONE light lift day with a road ride * ONE interval day with medium/short intervals or long (5 min) * Another easy ride. Combined, that’s about 14 of training with rest days. Then you start over again.]]></description>
