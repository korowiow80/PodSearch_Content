      <title>Announcement Using Fred, one of Macintosh's speech synthesizer voices.</title>
      <description>It has been a while since I've put a new podcast here.
In the near future, I'll be putting new podcasts online again.
Thanks for your patience.

This is Fred, one of the Macintosh speech sythesizer voices, for esl.podoatic.com.


I just put this online so you can hear a voice synthesizer.
I do not recommend trying to sound like this voice.</description>
