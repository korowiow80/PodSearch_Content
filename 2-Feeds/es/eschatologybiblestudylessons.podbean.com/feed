			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this study of Daniels 70 Weeks prophecy, we focus on the larger picture which includes the events of chapter 7, namely the little horn. It is obvious that the character which receives the center of attention is the little horn. The reason behind the other characters is the context which they provide for the manifestation of the little horn&#8217;s appearance.</p>
<p>The imagery of Daniel 7 is the role the beasts play in the last days of Ancient Israel. The context clearly focuses on judgment, the parousia, and the destruction of the enemies of God.

		<itunes:summary>In this study of Daniels 70 Weeks prophecy, we focus on the larger picture which includes the events of chapter 7, namely the little horn. It is obvious that the character which receives the center of attention is the little horn. The reason behind the other characters is the context which they provide for the manifestation of the little horn's appearance.

The imagery of Daniel 7 is the role the beasts play in the last days of Ancient Israel. The context clearly focuses on judgment, the parousia, and the destruction of the enemies of God. In that respect, the chapter is an enlargement and recapitulation of the vision of chapter two. This is one of the ways in which Daniel's book follows the format of visions in the book of Revelation.

The key to unraveling the prophetic message of the little horn and the consummation is understanding the nuances of how the text reads. Read it too fast and it's likely that you will form conclusions of events which appear to happen but do not. For this reason, the recording has some landmarks for your.

We're also preparing a study chart to go along with it at the main site, so be sure to check it out at AllThingsFulfilled.com. Send us any feedback you have. We hope you enjoy this little study on Daniel's 70 Weeks featuring the Little Horn of chapter 7,</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>The Prophets of God Experience Layoffs</h1>
<p><em>The prophets</em> exercised a unique function in Israel, primarily to teach the law of God as delivered to Moses, but also to issue warnings and call forth the judgments contained within the law when people refused to obey it.</p>
<p>A major part of the role of the prophet was that of Seer or forth-teller. Through the inspiration of God they were able to foretell the future. This marked their divine office as so unique that Moses wrote, that if the thing prophesied did not come to pass, that is the word which the Lord has not spoken, (Duet. 18:18-21)</p>
<p>Today, many are speaking words claiming to be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the prophets of God.</span> Yet, God spoke of the time which would come to pass that the prophets would pass out of the land of Israel. Today&#8217;s podcast focuses on that text and shows the outcome of ignoring the message. <a title="The Prophets of God" href="http://www.allthingsfulfilled.com/do-the-prophets-of-god-yet-speak/" target="_blank">For more information and to see the chart for the lesson by Click Here.</a></p>
<h2>Huge Job Loss For the Prophets</h2>
<p>As many prophets considered the prospect of job loss, others turned to new occupations. The issue was not without pre-warning. The Hebrew prophets experience huge layoffs during the intertestament period. They were accustomed to supplementing their income from agriculture and other pursuits.</p>
<p>What is hard to explain is how some got rehired after the company shut down. It is this phenomenon that is somewhat addressed in the podcast message. Not only have some reopened offices that had a mandate for closing, they&#8217;ve continued to persuade people that the office is not closed and attempt to maintain operations.</p>
<h3>Ongoing Investigations of the Prophets</h3>
<p>For this reason, some are conducting their own investigations of the documents related to the shut down of the prophetic office. They are astonished at the findings.</p>
<p>One common thread in which they all agree is that there most certainly was a date announced for the termination. Now they have to try the case to see if God lied or if the defendants (those claiming to be<strong> the prophets</strong> of Israel) are lying.</p>
<p>Most of these prophets are not found in Israel, but rather in Christian churches. Ofter they&#8217;re intention is not to be deceptive, many are ignorant of the laws and instructions given to the prophets.

		<itunes:summary>The Prophets of God Experience Layoffs
The prophets exercised a unique function in Israel, primarily to teach the law of God as delivered to Moses, but also to issue warnings and call forth the judgments contained within the law when people refused to obey it.

A major part of the role of the prophet was that of Seer or forth-teller. Through the inspiration of God they were able to foretell the future. This marked their divine office as so unique that Moses wrote, that if the thing prophesied did not come to pass, that is the word which the Lord has not spoken, (Duet. 18:18-21)

Today, many are speaking words claiming to be the prophets of God. Yet, God spoke of the time which would come to pass that the prophets would pass out of the land of Israel. Today's podcast focuses on that text and shows the outcome of ignoring the message. For more information and to see the chart for the lesson by Click Here.

<p>The Jewish prophets, often imitated but never duplicated belong to a class all to themselves. They were unique and of limited duration. It is common for some to claim to be prophets today, i.e. inspired men and women who&#8217;s word hold&#8217;s equal rank to those written in scripture. Nevertheless the Jewish prophets saw their own efforts as fading into a more permanent form.</p>
<p>Daniel 9:24, speaks of the time of sealing up vision and prophecy. Zechariah 13:1-5, warns against pretending to be a prophet after the prophetic era has closed. Moses gave the litmus test for a true prophet saying that if the thing prophesied does not come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord has not spoken.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen many examples of the alleged prophesied imminent end times in our day yet, it has not occurred. This causes many to believe God&#8217;s word is untrustworthy. However, it is not a matter of God&#8217;s veracity but of the interpreter&#8217;s claim to be a prophet. The audio messages offers more on the subject.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The year 2012 is dawning upon us and with it will be more speculation on the end of the world. In today&#8217;s podcast we present some of the reasons why 2012 will be another year as the previous as far as the end of the world as we know it is concerned. The End of the World May 21, 2011 was exposed as the work of charlatans preying upon the uninformed masses who believed that the end was near. Many sold possessions believing they would be raptured from the earth.</p>
<p>It is sad that some radio ministries carry more authority with people than the Bible. We&#8217;re not against radio ministries. We have one of our own. What we hope to encourage is that people read to ensure they are not being sold a bill of goods about the end of the planet.</p>
<p>Such fatalism sounds good, is commercially profitable but is not scriptural. Check out today&#8217;s podcast for more information on the end of the world 2012. Also visit the blog for the written version here at  <a title="End of the World 2012" href="http://www.allthingsfulfilled.com/waiting-for-the-end-of-the-world-2012/" target="_blank">End of the World 2012 AllThingsFulfilled.com</a></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As history would prove, the time of judgment has arrived for Israel. In September, the UN may decide upon the statehood of the Palestinian people.

<p>Some have opposed the President for his stand on requesting a peace process based on the 1967 borders. They are shouting this is <a title="Obama Israel and Palestine" href="http://www.allthingsfulfilled.com/israel-palestinian-conflict-becomes-obama-israel-issue/" target="_blank">un-American and anti-Semitic.</a> Usually, the moral card is often played in politics but it is unlikely that the moral card can be played with Israel. What are the implications for Dispensationalism and Christian Zionists who support Israel? Are they for peace? Are they willing to follow principles of the Bible?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Birth Pangs of the New Creation</h1>
<p><em>The analogy of the birth pangs</em> in Romans 8, demonstrate very clearly that the last days events of resurrection, the coming of the Lord and birth of the new nation or creation was imminent. Dispensationalists skew the meaning of the text by focusing on geopolitical and socioeconomic events of the current time. Eschatology in scripture is not a subject for modern media news headlines, yet, many get their vision for the end directly from the most sensational news story.</p>
<h2>Mello Means About to Be, An Event Soon to Occur</h2>
<p>At least three times, God indicated <a href="http://www.allthingsfulfilled.com/the-last-days-dvd-series/">the imminent proximity of the end in Romans 8:17-23</a>. He uses the words &#8220;the present time&#8221; versus the glory about to be (mellousan) revealed in us. This word means something that is soon to occur. Scholars often through bias, mistranslate and apply the word to a long protracted future, but the context suggests always reveals an imminent time.</p>
<h2>Firstfruits Suggest A Harvest is Already Underway</h2>
<p>Another word in the context which suggests imminence is the concept of Firstfruits. The firstfruits, from aparche suggests that the harvest is already underway. Harvest is an analogous term used for the end times events. See Matthew 3:10-11 where John the Baptizer speaks of separating the chaff from the wheat. Jesus uses a similar analogy in the parable of the tars.</p>
<h2>Birth Pangs - Imminent Consummation of Pregnancy</h2>
<p>The third term of imminence in the text is that of the birth pangs. We cover this in more detail in the recording. The <strong>birth pangs </strong>suggest a women who as gone into labor and is about to deliver a child. The time is extremely urgent and immeinent. This hardly is a fitting term for a last days program that is already near to being two millennia. Such does not &#8220;cut the mustard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The solution is found is applying these terms in their imminent context, showing these events to have already occurred. As you listen to today&#8217;s podcast, note the references and seek to understand them as they were first utter to first century disciples.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Birth Pangs of the New Creation
The analogy of the birth pangs in Romans 8, demonstrate very clearly that the last days events of resurrection, the coming of the Lord and birth of the new nation or creation was imminent. Dispensationalists skew the meaning of the text by focusing on geopolitical and socioeconomic events of the current time. Eschatology in scripture is not a subject for modern media news headlines, yet, many get their vision for the end directly from the most sensational news story.
Mello Means About to Be, An Event Soon to Occur
At least three times, God indicated the imminent proximity of the end in Romans 8:17-23. He uses the words "the present time" versus the glory about to be (mellousan) revealed in us. This word means something that is soon to occur. Scholars often through bias, mistranslate and apply the word to a long protracted future, but the context suggests always reveals an imminent time.
Firstfruits Suggest A Harvest is Already Underway
Another word in the context which suggests imminence is the concept of Firstfruits. The firstfruits, from aparche suggests that the harvest is already underway. Harvest is an analogous term used for the end times events. See Matthew 3:10-11 where John the Baptizer speaks of separating the chaff from the wheat. Jesus uses a similar analogy in the parable of the tars.
Birth Pangs - Imminent Consummation of Pregnancy
The third term of imminence in the text is that of the birth pangs. We cover this in more detail in the recording. The birth pangs suggest a women who as gone into labor and is about to deliver a child. The time is extremely urgent and immeinent. This hardly is a fitting term for a last days program that is already near to being two millennia. Such does not "cut the mustard."

The solution is found is applying these terms in their imminent context, showing these events to have already occurred. As you listen to today's podcast, note the references and seek to understand them as they were first utter to first century disciples.

It should become very clear as Abraham&#8217;s lineage is traced that he has no physical descendants who were to inherit the promises through him. Study carefully the Gen. 22 and observe what he does to Isaac then compare with Hebrews 11:17-19.</p>
<p>Based on those events no physical descendant of Abraham could have an inheritance to the promises of Gen. 12:3. In fact, not even Christ himself, which is why he had to die to the realm of the flesh and rise in the realm of the Spirit.
