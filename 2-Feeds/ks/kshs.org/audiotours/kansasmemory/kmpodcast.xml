<title>Governor Mike Hayden Interview</title>

<link>http://www.kshs.org/p/kansas-memory-podcast/10092</link>
<author>lfredericksen@kshs.org (Lin Fredericksen)</author>
<description>Kansas governor Mike Hayden held office from January 12, 1987 - January 14, 1991. Hayden grew up in Atwood in northwest Kansas and relied heavily on support from agriculture and the rural areas of the state in his 1986 campaign. During his administration a comprehensive state highway plan was passed and statewide reappraisal was implemented. Hayden lost his bid for re-election to Kansas' first woman governor, Joan Finney, largely because of the reappraisal controversy.</description>

<title>Governor John Carlin Interview</title>

<link>http://www.kshs.org/audiotours/kansasmemory/069_john_carlin_interview.htm</link>
<author>lfredericksen@kshs.org (Lin Fredericksen)</author>
<description>This features excerpts from the second interview with Kansas Governor John Carlin, who held office from January 8, 1979 to January 12, 1987. In 1978, in a surprise upset, he defeated the Republican incumbent Governor, Robert Bennett, in his bid for re-election. In this interview, Carlin recalls that Bennett initially won, not because he was a popular choice, but because his Democratic opponent was Vern Miller, the controversial Wichita sheriff and Kansas Attorney General from 1971-1975. Carlin ran for a third non-consecutive term as governor in 1990 in one of the most interesting Democratic primary races in Kansas history.</description>

<description>Kansas Governor John Carlin held office from January 8, 1979 to January 12, 1987. He was elected to the Kansas legislature in 1970 and was Minority Leader of the House from 1975-1977; then Speaker of the House from 1977-1979, when Democrats unexpectedly won a majority. In 1978, Carlin upset incumbent Governor Robert Bennett's re-election bid by only 16,335 votes. The interview is the basis for Dr. Bob Beatty's article, "Be willing to take some risks to make things happen," published in Kansas History, vol. 31 (Summer 2008). Video and a complete transcript of the interview is available on Kansas Memory.</description>

<author>lfredericksen@kshs.org (Lin Fredericksen)</author>
<description>William Avery would have never become a politician if not for a series of disastrous floods in Kansas in the mid 20th century. He was the third generation of Averys farming near Wakefield, in Clay County, when President Truman appropriated funds to build two dams in the Blue Valley that would inundate his farm. Avery became an opposition leader and was elected to serve in the Kansas Legislature from 1951-1955, and went on to serve in the U. S. House of Representatives from 1955-1965, though he was unable to stop the dam project. In 1965, Avery became Kansas 37th governor. Video and a complete transcript of the interview is available on Kansas Memory.</description>

<description>This podcast features excerpts from the letters written home by young Clark Bruster of Waverly, New York during the fall of 1917 while he was training with U. S. Artillery Battery A at Fort Riley, Kansas. Some artillery are still drawn by horses during WWI and Clark describes their drills in detail. He is proud of what an accomplished horseman he has become, but saddened that he is missing the birth of his first niece.</description>

<author>lfredericksen@kshs.org (Lin Fredericksen)</author>
<description>Clark Bruster's great-grandfather was an early settler of Waverly, N. Y., a village on the New York/Pennsylvania border. Harvey and Cora Bruster raised Clark and his brothers there in the early 1900s. Waverly had about 6,000 residents at that time. Clark had finished school and begun working as a meat salesman in nearby Elmira, when the U.S. entry into World War I changed his life dramatically. From Fort Slocum on Long Island, Clark boarded a train to travel to Fort Riley, Kansas, in June 1917, to begin training with an Artillery Battery. These are excerpts from letters he wrote to his family from Fort Riley during the summer and fall of 1917. They begin on June 21st, the week the first U.S. troops were landing in France.</description>

<description>Susan Bixby Dimond and her husband Will made the long journey from her family home in Mayville, New York, to Osborne County, Kansas, in February 1872 to begin a promising new life in the West.   Susan was a 30 year-old former schoolteacher; Will was a Civil War veteran from Pennsylvania who worked as a blacksmith in addition to farming.  Their severest test came during the winter of 1874 and 1875, after millions of locusts had descended on the Midwest the previous summer, decimating every shred of vegetation.  The settlers only survived due to the generous relief shipments from the East.  The excerpts were reading today are from January through March of 1875, before the locusts returned and destroyed that years crops as well.</description>

<description>John William Gardiner was the third of nine children in the large Gardiner family. His parents, William and Susan, were farmers who moved from Missouri to Jefferson County, Kansas Territory, in March 1855 when John was four years old. These excerpts are from the diary he kept in 1875 while completing classes in Leavenworth in order to obtain his teaching certificate, then teaching at a new school in Winchester in Jefferson County. He impatiently waits for letters from his girlfriend, Mattie. He enjoys musical performances and often sings himself. His diary gives us a first hand look at what it was like to be a one room school teacher in a blossoming frontier town</description>

<title>James Butler &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok Letter</title>

<link>http://www.kshs.org/audiotours/kansasmemory/060_james_hickok_letter.htm</link>
<author>lfredericksen@kshs.org (Lin Fredericksen)</author>
<description>Before he became the &quot;Wild Bill&quot; of legend, James Butler Hickok was one of hundreds of immigrants who streamed into Territorial Kansas hoping to acquire a piece of the Indian reservation lands that were coming onto the market. After the Kansas/Nebraska Act passed in 1854, Northeast Kansas was no longer Indian Territory and it turned into a battleground between the pro-slavery and free-state settlers. James grew up in Troy Grove, Illinois, where his father, William Alonzo Hickok, was an abolitionist who helped slaves escape to the North. James was 19 when he journeyed to Johnson County, Kansas, in June 1856. Records show James tried to pre-empt a claim for 160 acres of Shawnee land in February 1858. It turned out, that land had already been claimed for Wyandotte Float Land. After that, James tried to acquire some Delaware Reservation land, but was again unsuccessful. The violence along the Missouri/Kansas border was at its peak when Hickok arrived and he mentions his involvement in the Battle of Hickory Point in this letter that he wrote to his brother Horace from Kansas on November 24 and 27th, 1856.</description>

<description>Robert Fonzo Layher enlisted in the U. S. Navy in 1939 and was assigned to the North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego, when he resigned his commission to join the American Volunteer Group. This was a covert operation that served with the Chinese Air Force under U. S. General Claire Chennault. Since it was organized before the U. S. declared war on Japan, the pilots were technically working for a private military contractor to guarantee that supplies reached the Republic of China's armed forces through Burma, during the Japanese occupation of eastern China. Hear Layher's story of flying with the secret air force that preceded the U.S.'s entry into WWII.</description>

<description>Mabel Holmes, a longtime Topeka resident, kept a daily diary from January 1, 1935-December 31, 1939. During this time, storms resulting from the severe drought conditions blanketed the state in dust so thick that it could be pitch black in the middle of the day; Kansans were coping with an economic depression even worse than our current one; the threat of a second World War in Europe was looming. Against this backdrop, Mabel talks about the news, weather, shopping, outings with her sister, Elma and their friends and her volunteer work with her church and local women's groups. It's a personal time capsule of an era when Kansas and the nation was experiencing unprecedented change.</description>

<title>The Indian War of 1868-69, part 2</title>

<author>lfredericksen@kshs.org (Lin Fredericksen)</author>
<description>In 1868, raids by hostile Indian bands on the western frontier increased as the white population of Kansas swelled after the Civil War and railroads were built father west. George Armstrong Custer and the 7th U. S. Cavalry were assigned to pursue the Indian tribes to their winter camps and force them to return to the reservations. In Kansas, Governor Crawford quickly raised a volunteer regiment, then decided to resign from office and lead the 19th Kansas Cavalry himself. They joined Generals Sheridan and Custer shortly after the attack on Black Kettle's Village. The troops accompanied Custer on his mission to retrieve two Kansas women, Anna Morgan and Sarah White, who had been abducted during the fall. George Jenness, the commander of Company F of the 19th Kansas, wrote this account of the winter expedition based on his diaries. </description>

<description>In 1868, raids by hostile Indian bands on the western frontier increased as the white population of Kansas swelled after the Civil War and railroads were built father west. That winter the U. S. Army, led by General Sheridan, decided to pursue bands of Cheyenne, Sioux and Comanche to their winter camps and force them to return to government reservations by destroying their food and horses. General Custer and the 7th U. S. Cavalry were chosen for this winter campaign. In Kansas, young governor Samuel Crawford, outraged by the continuing violence, received permission to quickly raise a regiment of Kansas men to assist the U. S. troops. At the last minute, Crawford decided to resign from office and lead 19th Kansas Cavalry himself. They marched southwest from Wichita to join Generals Sheridan and Custer. George Jenness, the commander of Company F of the 19th Kansas, wrote this account of the winter expedition based on his diaries.</description>

<description>Ned Beck continued writing in his diary throughout the summer of 1880, so we have his first-hand account of Holton, Kansas' 4th of July festivities. Holton planned to hold a community picnic on July 3rd, since July 4th fell on Sunday that year, but it was an unusually rainy summer and that Saturday was no exception, so the celebration was somewhat subdued.  Just like kids today, Ned's favorite part of the holiday was the fireworks.  Here's his description of the events of that week.</description>

<description>Another school year is coming to a close in Holton, 
            Kansas. Final exams; class picnics; summer baseball teams forming--it 
            could be May 2009--but 11 year old Ned Beck wrote this diary in 1880. 
            This podcast features Ned's diary entries during late May. Moses and 
            Mary Beck are enlarging their home to accomodate their full household: 
            Ned, or Edward, their oldest son, his younger brother William, who 
            is 7, and two daughters: Mattie, 9, and Clara, 3. In addition, they 
            have a 17-year-old servant named Ida Walton living with them and two 
            young male boarders, Charles "Ed" Rose and Fred Brown. Ned's father 
            ran a drug store and published the Holton newspaper, The Recorder. 
            Ned and his younger brother, Will, often helped out in their father's 
            businesses, in addition to doing farm chores. Hear about the activities 
            that filled Ned's summer days.</description>

<description>In the late 19th century, American tax laws favored Northeastern industrialists, who amassed enormous fortunes, while farmers in rural America found it harder and harder to make a living. The Farmer's Alliance, combined with other labor movements, formed The People's Party and took control of the Kansas House of Representatives in 1890. Kansas newspaper editor, William Peffer, represented the Populists in the U. S. Senate from 1891 to 1897. This podcast is drawn from his editorials, which championed the economic reforms the farmers called for.</description>

<description>Samuel Reader joined the Kansas State Militia in Shawnee County when the war broke out between the North and South, but they didn't see action until "Price's Raid" in the late fall of 1864.  Samuel wrote this eye-witness account of the Battle of the Big Blue in 1898, based on his 1864 diary entries.  The Militia helped delay the advance of the Confederate troops, even though they were inexperienced and outnumbered 6-to-1.  They suffered heavy losses and Samuel was among the men taken prisoner by the Rebels.  He soon escaped and witnessed Price's defeat at the Battle of Mine Creek in Linn County three days later.</description>

<description>Samuel began keeping a daily record of his life at the age of thirteen and continued faithfully until he died in 1914 at the age of 78.  In 1855, when he was just 19, he moved from Illinois to Kansas Territory.  These passages are from Samuels diary of 1861, when the war between the North and South is just beginning.  Most of Samuels narration is about their every day struggle to raise livestock and produce enough crops to survive in the harsh Kansas climate. He includes copies of his letters home to his family in Illinois.</description>

<itunes:summary>Samuel began keeping a daily record of his life at the age of thirteen and continued faithfully until he died in 1914 at the age of 78.  In 1855, when he was just 19, he moved from Illinois to Kansas Territory.  These passages are from Samuels diary of 1861, when the war between the North and South is just beginning.  Most of Samuels narration is about their every day struggle to raise livestock and produce enough crops to survive in the harsh Kansas climate. He includes copies of his letters home to his family in Illinois.</itunes:summary>

<author>kgoodman@kshs.org (Kirsten Goodman)</author>
<description>"In early December of 1944, Second Lieutenant Martin Jones of the 106th Division of the Army moved through Belgium to the German border. Jones and his division were scattered through the Ardennes forest when the Germans began moving tanks across the border. The battle that ensued, called the Battle of the Bulge, lasted from December 16, 1944 through January 25, 1945 and claimed over 75,000 casualties and prisoners of war. He recalls the engagement and his subsequent capture at the hands of the Germans. Jones was from Osage City, Kansas, and his experiences were recorded by the Rice County project, part of the Kansas Veterans of WWII Oral History Grant Project, funded by the Kansas Legislature in 2005.

<title>Eastern Cowboy - Harry Boehme Fine</title>
<link>http://www.kshs.org/audiotours/kansasmemory/043_harry_fine.htm </link>
<author>skeckeisen@kshs.org (Sara Keckeisen)</author>
<description>In the spring of 1915, fifteen year old Harry Fine graduated from the Princeton Preparatory School in Princeton, New Jersey. That fall, he headed west to spend a year as a working cowboy in Maple Hill, Kansas. Harry's father, founder and headmaster of the Princeton Preparatory School, thought Harry could use some "real-life" experience before he continued his studies. Before he left home, Harry promised his parents he would write every week with an account of his adventures. His parents saved his letters, dated between October 1915 and June 1916. They give an interesting and colorful picture of cowboy life and growing up in early 20th century Kansas.

<author>mchurch@kshs.org (Michael Church)</author>
<description>This podcast features two stories recorded by visitors to the Forces of Nature exhibit, currently on display at the Kansas Museum of History through January 9th, 2009. In the first segment, farmer and author Thomas Holmquist describes a 2007 flood on his farm in Saline County near Smolan. The second recording is by Holmquist's wife, Marlysue Esping-Holmquist. She describes the history of their farm and how it was obtained through an allotment system in 1868 by her ancestors, who didn't realize it lay in the flood plain near Dry Creek.  These recordings are available on the Historical Society's website for primary sources, Kansas Memory, at www.kansasmemory.org.

This podcast features entries from Martha's diary that describe her courtship and first marriage to John W. Shaw, a post man in Topeka, Kansas.  In these entries, Martha is in her early twenties and describes her involvement with several boyfriends, including breaking off an engagement with one of them.  She is very candid about her feelings and many of her diary entries are very emotional.  At this point in time, it is difficult to determine if these accounts are her actual feelings, the highs and lows of young women, or if she is being flirtatious and melodramatic, which might have been part of the expected standards of courtship and marriage in the late Victorian era.  </description>

<description>Children's lives have changed dramatically in America in the last hundred years.  Today we take it for granted that children will attend public school and not work full-time, but in the early 1900's, laws regulating child labor were still evolving.  Hear what Kansas parents and business owners had to say about these laws when they first took effect.</description>

<title>A Gift of Opportunity:  Harry Colmery and the GI Bill of Rights</title>
<link>http://www.kshs.org/audiotours/kansasmemory/026_colmery_harry.htm</link>
<author>pmichaelis@kshs.org (Pat Michaelis)</author>
<description>Harry Colmery, a Topekan, is credited with writing the initial draft of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as the GI Bill of Rights.  He was part of a committee formed by the national American Legion to secure benefits for those men and women who served in World War II.  This pod cast features Colmery's testimony to Congress about what the United States owed to the men and women who had fought for the freedom and liberty of their country. Many historians credit the GI Bill with the rise of a college-educated middle class and with the increase in home ownership among U.S. citizens.  </description>

<description>Dwight D. Eisenhower--a sailor???  In 1910, Dwight D. Eisenhower requested an appointment to West Point or the naval academy from his U. S. Senator Joseph Bristow of Salina, Kansas.  This podcast features the letters he wrote to Senator Bristow and allows the listener to speculate on how the course of history may have been changed if Eisenhower--the future Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force and 34th President of the United States--had served in the U. S. Navy rather than the U. S. Army.  The text for this podcast was written by Jerry Veatch, KSHS volunteer.  </description>

<title>Elam Bartholomew:  An Ordinary and Extraordinary Kansan</title>
<link>http://www.kshs.org/audiotours/kansasmemory/022_bartholomew_elam.htm </link>
<author>pmichaelis@kshs.org (Pat Michaelis)</author>
<description>In many ways, Elam Bartholomew was a typical Kansas settler as he encountered most of the challenges facing those settling on the Great Plains.  He is an extraordinary Kansan because he recorded his life's events for 60 years in his daily diaries.  He settled in Kansas in 1874.  He returned to Illinois to marry and returned to Rooks County, Kansas, with his new wife Rachel in 1876.   This podcast is based on excerpts from the diary for 1877 and 1878.  It details his farming activities and those of his neighbors, with whom he traded work.  It includes his comments on the birth of his first child, a land dispute among neighbors, organizing literary societies and a church, fighting prairie fires, and reports of an Indian raid.  Though not documented in the diary, Bartholomew is also extraordinary because he was nationally known as a naturalist who studied fungi that grew on grain products.  He is credited with identifying several hundred new species.  </description>

<title>The Never Ending Struggle for Equality</title>
<link>http://www.kshs.org/audiotours/kansasmemory/020_struggle_for_equality.htm </link>
<author>pmichaelis@kshs.org (Pat Michaelis)</author>

<description>As the citizens of Territorial Kansas were writing constitutions that would determine whether or not slavery was allowed in Kansas, they were also debating the issues of voting rights for blacks (in the versions that excluded slavery) and women.  This debate was occurring across the nation among abolitionists and supporters of the woman's suffrage movement.  This podcast features documents that address the arguments in favor of allowing most adults to vote in elections.  The preamble to the constitution of the Moneka Woman's Rights association lists the rights women did not have.  A pamphlet by several prominent Kansans during the 1867 suffrage campaing outlines arguments in favor of votes for women and blacks.  The final document reports the results of women voting in municipal elections for the first time in 1887.  </description>

<title>The Exodusters</title>

<author>lfredericksen@kshs.org (Lin Fredericksen)</author>
<description>After the Civil War, freed slaves in the South faced an uncertain future. Economically destitute, they struggled to establish schools and buy their own land. The establishment of the sharecropping system, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the entrenchment of segregation made their chances for success remote. In 1877, when Reconstruction ended, and federal troops withdrew,Black families began to leave the South by the thousands, looking for a better future. They were called Exodusters. Excerpts from letters written in 1879 help tell the story of the Exodusters journey to Kansas.</description>

<title>John Brown:  Compassionate or Violent</title>
<link>http://www.kshs.org/audiotours/kansasmemory/016_john_brown.htm </link>
<author>pmichaelis@kshs.org (Pat Michaelis)</author>

<description>John Brown was an ardent anti slavery proponent.  Because of his well know acts of violence including his raid on the government arsenal at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, he is often portrayed as a terrorist or madman.  He was also a dedicated and compassionate family man.  The excerpts used in this podcast show the private side of Brown.    However, his personality was extremely complicated and a few letters can only serve to encourage the listener to learn more about this complex man.  A letter from Lydia Maria Child indicates that she does not approve of his actions but she supports his cause.  The text for this podcast was written by Jerry Veatch, KSHS volunteer.  </description>

S. Whitney to her uncle proclaiming her determination to support the free state cause.
