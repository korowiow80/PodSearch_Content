			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode of the Spiraken Movie Review, We close out the month of  Swords, Sorcery, and Sweaty Shirtless Guys with a film possibly worthy of the fantasy genre.So kick back and relax and Xan, Deke and Kal, go through scene by scene and review the 1984 manly and barbarianesqe fantasy film &#8220;Conan the Destroyer&#8221; directed by Richer Fleischer and starring Sarah Douglas (wasn&#8217;t she in Superman 2), Wilt &#8220;The Stilt&#8221; Chamberlain (would you trust him to guard your underage hot virgin niece?), Sven-Ole Thorsen (look kids, It&#8217;s La Fours&#8230; again), Grace Jones (She&#8217;s a man, she has to be), Mako ( Still Considered the Greatest Voice Actor Ever), Olivia D&#8217;Abo (If she wasn&#8217;t Underage&#8230;), Tracey Walter( Most Useless sidekick Ever, and Bob got what was coming to him in Batman ), Arnold Schwarzenegger (now no longer the Governator), with a special cameo by Andre The Giant (Greatest WWF Wrestler arguably)</p>

And for you our listeners, Xan, Deke  and Kal go all out and review one of the greatest Christmas Movies of All Time   &#8220;Die Hard&#8221; directed by John McTiernan and starring Bruce Willis, Reginald Veljohnson and Alan Rickman.</p>

<p>For the first part of this episode Deke, Xan and Kal do their very first Spiraken Email Review and discuss the 3 emails sent to us. Then, after discussing some of the future releases in Film, They proceed to get down and dirty with John McClane in this week&#8217;s review. They talk about awesome corporate bosses, ponder about where one can hire a minion and comment on the incompetence of the LAPD in this movie. However due to an error in the recording software, Xan and Co. had to perform a Christmas miracle and reconstruct this entire podcast. So the audio quality of this episode is a little shakey and the ending is a little weak but otherwise we hope you enjoy it.  Remember we have two contests going on right now. The Top 10 Movie Vehicles of All Time Contest and the big Tronouski quote Contest. For more info please check the forum under contests for rules and prizes.

<p>Deke and Xan go through this awesome movie and debate on Conan&#8217;s masculinity, punching camels, the flamability of hairgel, and what makes Crom angry. Besides this, they also test out a new segment, reading texts from last night (www.tfln.com) as well as go through a brief overview of their personal history together and wonder why hippies allow their children to partake in controlled substances. Kal also makes an apperance as he gives his feeling on what makes this movie good.  Violence and Beheading awaits you in this episode, so hope you are ready for it</p>

So for this episode  Xan, Bell-chan, Fightbait (John Paul) &amp; Kal examine the otaku condition with the infamous <strong>Trilogy of Otakudom</strong>. So listen as Kal reviews the lighter side of being a manga, anime, and video game fan in the Outstanding College Series  &#8220;Genshiken&#8221; by Kio Shinoku, while Fightbait explores the evil depths of hikikimori, lolicons, moe and drug use in the depressing yet funny manga adaption &#8220;Welcome to the NHK&#8221; by Tatsuhiko Takimoto.

Bell-Chan adds to the mix with a unique perspective on how long this podcast has been around as well as why Xan did it. Xan also gets into a discussion with Kal about the recent state of Scanlations and Shonen Jump&#8217;s stance on it. Thanks to all the listeners who contributed to this episode with a voicemail or email. So to Deke, LokeyC, Hope, Tim, Sasser, and the Illustrious Daryl Surat, Thank you very much . Unfortunately, Xan was unable to include everyone&#8217;s because of time constrants as well as poor audio quality. So to Jasper, Malicite 23, Ruby, Hannyness, Susishi, Mrtodokichi and Saphire, sorry about not being able to use your stuff. I will try to include it next tiem. This episode has lots of unique sound effects which help make the podcast more interactive. There is also a lot of cool background music that makes the episode even more awesome. Also remember to stay for the stinger. If you get the reference you are awesome!!!  Remember to check out Xan&#8217;s antics on the Fightbait.com podcast . Tell us about this podcast, if you loved it, if you hate it. Send an email to spiraken@gmail.com and give us congratulations for reaching episode 100. Or if you really want to be creative. leave a voicemail at 206-350-8462.  Thank you and to all the children&#8230; CONGRATULATIONS!!!

While this manga will probably never be released in America due to it insulting everyone from the jewish to germans to prison inmates and americans. it is truly a bizarre and odd and dramatic manga. Also Xan rants and raves as usual/

While intriguing, this episode may be a little bit distressing especially when Xan begins to comptenplate the meaning of life and why it is so short. Hope you enjoy the episode and don&#8217;t try to get depressed by this.

This episode was done in advance so no new news. Xan forgot to explain this in the episode but here is some additional information about Koi Kaze
<p>The manga which Xan reviewed is very sad. Not sad in a cry baby sad but rather in a meloncoly way. Rarely does a manga, which deals with incest, show the negative side of that kind of relationship. Koi Kaze examines this topic and shows the forbidden love between two who should not be in love The characters in this manga are in a situation which should never be even thought of. It goes against several taboos and is something that they both know to be wrong but they stick with it. The fact that Koshiro is concerned about the social taboos and the reprecussions of Nanoko and his actions shows how developed a manga this is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE!!!Xan &amp; The Spiraken Manga Review does not condone this type of relationship and while it is shown in this work of fiction to be romantic, in reality, there are serious negative implications and results to an incestuous relationship. Besides religious and social taboos, there are also several biological taboos which should never be crossed. </strong></p>
<p>Also remember Xan will be attending AnimeNext in New Jersey, June 12th-14th so check it out and if you see him there you get a t-shirt Check Out Xan&#8217;s Article on Anime3000.com as well as his sidekickery on  the Fightbait Anime &amp; Gaming Podcast  And finally, we are still looking for the voice of THE WHEEL OF MANGA. Send an mp3 or a voice mail of you saying Wheel of Manga and see if you can become the wheel of manga voice.</p>

He and Guest Host Baz insult several demographics and even talk bad about Star Wars, Lord of the Rings,Star Trek, and even video games like Smackdown vs Raw, Burnout Paradise, and Call of Duty. Sorry that this was not a full review episode, I tried to keep it as clean as I could but well, when i hang out with Baz, things go a little haywire.  Episode 41 will be back to basics about reviewing manga I promise. If this is your first exposure to spiraken, go back and listen to earlier episodes. OFFICIALLY THE LONGEST EPISODE EVER

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the Society for providing information and reviews of Manga&#8217;s website, also known as Spiraken. We are a manga review podcast that reviews and discusses various mangas each week. Each episode we review 2 different mangas and give them a rating.</p>
<p>The ratings are:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in">1) Have a Priest purify itâ¦.and 	then we burn it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in">2) Your typical reading materialâ¦at 	your local Correctional Facility or Psychiatric Institution.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in">3) A gift from crazy Aunt Muriel&#8230;okay but forgettable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in">4) Borrow it from a friend and never return it&#8230;unless offered Pocky.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in; margin-bottom: 0in">5) Reallly, really fucking cool. If you do not buy this right now 	your blood will dry out, your brain will freeze, and your soul will 	be forfeit to the great Zomagustar! Mwa ha ha ha! <font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">(Hail Ippallazo!)</font></p>
<p>Also here are some basic concepts and terms we use in this podcast.</p>
<p><em>manga</em>- the Japanese word for comics and print cartoons. In their modern form, manga date from shortly after World War II but have a long, complex history in earlier Japanese art.</p>
<p>In Japan, manga are widely read by people of all ages, so that a broad range of subjects and topics occur in manga.
