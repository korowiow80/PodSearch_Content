      <media:title>March 5: Rusty McClure and Coral Castle</media:title>
      <media:text type="plain">March 5, 2011. New York Times best-selling author Rusty McClure
(&quot;Crosley,&quot; &quot;Cincinnatus&quot;) joins us to discuss Florida's Coral Castle
and the mysterious man who built it, Edward Leedskalnin. How did this
tiny man move these huge rocks? Was there supernatural or alien forces
at work? And how does Ed tie into those titans of 20th century
industry, the Crosley Brothers? Rusty takes us on a fascinating
journey to find those answers.</media:text>
