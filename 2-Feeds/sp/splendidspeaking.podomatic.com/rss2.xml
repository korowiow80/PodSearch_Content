      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/36369/600x600_3453291.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hi and welcome to the latest podcast from Splendid Speaking. In this recording we're going to break with tradition and feature an interview with someone who's been using Flo-Joe's new writing critique and correction service for CAE, that's the Certificate in Advanced English. I'm speaking with Giada from Italy and at the time of the interview Giada was preparing for the CAE exam. I'm very pleased to be able to report that Giada passed and is now the proud owner of the Certificate in Advanced English. Well done Giada!

If you're interested in finding out more about Flo-Joe's CAE Writing Critique and Correction  service please contact us at info(at)flo-joe(dot)co(dot)uk and we'll send you further information.

In this recording we're going to break with tradition and feature an interview with someone who's been using Flo-Joe's new writing critique and correction service for CAE, that's the Certificate in Advanced English. I'm speaking with Giada from Italy and at the time of the interview Giada was preparing for the CAE exam. I'm very pleased to be able to report that Giada passed and is now the proud owner of the Certificate in Advanced English. Well done Giada!

'Why is music important around the world?'

which was taken from the CPE Handbook available from the Cambridge ESOL website.

      <title>Re-Posted: Spontaneous Talks</title>
      <description>This recording was first published in October 2006 and features Corina from Romania. In this interview we looked at the skill of giving spontaneous talks, a task in the CPE speaking paper and used the topic:

'Why is music important around the world?'

which was taken from the CPE Handbook available from the Cambridge ESOL website.

      <title>Effective Questions and Active Listening</title>
      <description>How good are you at making conversation with a complete stranger? Do you find it easy thinking of things to say or questions to ask? Well, this podcast features a conversation between two people who had never met before and who talked for the first time together through Skype. We have Solange from Brazil and Vukosava who is currently living in Portugal. This was a 'getting to know you' opportunity and the focus was on asking questions and showing interest in what the speaker has said. As you listen decide how well Solange and Vukosava managed to hold a natural and interesting conversation. In particular, decide how well they ask questions and also if they show interest in what the other has said. Finally, make a note of their use of English, which we'll look at in the feedback section. Let's listen to Solange and Vukosava. </description>

      <title>Responding to Questions (1)</title>
      <description>This podcast features Jedrzej from Poland, who is aiming to pass CPE (Certificate of Proficiency in English) offered by Cambridge ESOL. This was our first meeting in Skype and the session was a getting-to-know-you opportunity.An important skill to use in a situation where you are trying to showcase yourself or your English skills is the ability to give full answers to questions, particularly when closed 'Yes/No' questions are asked such as: 'Do you ...', 'Have you ...', 'Is it ...' , etc. To prepare for this interview Jedrzej used Unit 2 of 'Splendid Speaking', which looks at strategies for answering questions fully, in particular the use of examples to avoid replying simply with 'Yes/No' answers.As you listen decide how well Jedrzej managed to do this. Did he give full answers, even to closed 'Yes/No' questions? Finally, make a note of Jedrzej's use of English, which we'll look at in the feedback section. Let's listen to Jedrzej. Apologies for the distortion at the end of the recording, which was due to interference on Skype.</description>
