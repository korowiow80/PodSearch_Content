Drinking game words?  Boom or varations of such.  (We recommend that you drink water, but any beverage will do, even adult ones if you&#8217;re of age!)

First and foremost we had a great time on the Rock!

Spartan Math: 2 days of rain + 1 creative Race Director + 4500 athletes = 1 sloppy, crazy, muddy rad race day!  Over 4,500 athletes took it on September 24th.  One of those runners was our special guest: Stephanie Vaughan, who took the top female spot!  Stephanie, 28, with a background in skiing &#8211; Division 1 in college, arrived at Staten Island without her bag and found a pair of shoes in the discarded shoe pile that fit and those shoes helped her get a first place female finish!

Some highlights: The Hurricane Heat again had over 150 participants, Hobie Call took the top spot again and we had Al Harrington and some Biggest Loser contestants come run and they did an amazing job!  For a more indepth Staten Island Recap &#8211; Official Race Report can be found here.  http://blog.spartanrace.com/staten-island-rocks-the-super-spartan/

Chicago Race is shaping up to be pretty bad ass.  Yes, I said bad ass.  We are having a NIGHT hurricane heat -  http://blog.spartanrace.com/midwest-hurricane-heat-after-dark/.  Anytime mandatory gear involves headlamps and light sticks you know it&#8217;s going to be awesome! 

There is a price increase in Chicago on October 1st, so get signed up now!  Interesting note, our Race Director Mr. Mike Morris is flying out to the venue tonight to design the course &amp; obstacles this week so get ready for some mayhem!
Get registered HERE!

Malibu!  Spartan Race heads to the West Coast on November 19th and Heats are filling up fast!  We had to move the 9 &amp; 9:30 competitive heats to 8 &amp; 8:30 just to accommodate more racers!  We will have exciting new launches at this race as well&#8230;&#8230;.stay tuned ; ) And there will be a Hurricane Heat so keep your eyes opened for registration!  Register HERE!

Texas cash prize emails went out this week!  The cash prize heats will be selling out fast &#8211; top 10% were invited to compete for $10,000 for the first female and first male in the heat!  There will be a rad after party in Glen Rose so bring your dancing AND running shoes!  Register HERE!

VIDEO
No Video this week!

Drinking game words?  Boom or varations of such.  (We recommend that you drink water, but any beverage will do, even adult ones if you&#8217;re of age!)

First and foremost we had a great time on the Rock!

Spartan Math: 2 days of rain + 1 creative Race Director + 4500 athletes = 1 sloppy, crazy, muddy rad race day!  Over 4,500 athletes took it on September 24th.  One of those runners was our special guest: Stephanie Vaughan, who took the top female spot!  Stephanie, 28, with a background in skiing &#8211; Division 1 in college, arrived at Staten Island without her bag and found a pair of shoes in the discarded shoe pile that fit and those shoes helped her get a first place female finish!

Some highlights: The Hurricane Heat again had over 150 participants, Hobie Call took the top spot again and we had Al Harrington and some Biggest Loser contestants come run and they did an amazing job!  For a more indepth Staten Island Recap &#8211; Official Race Report can be found here.  http://blog.spartanrace.com/staten-island-rocks-the-super-spartan/

Chicago Race is shaping up to be pretty bad ass.  Yes, I said bad ass.  We are having a NIGHT hurricane heat -  http://blog.spartanrace.com/midwest-hurricane-heat-after-dark/.  Anytime mandatory gear involves headlamps and light sticks you know it&#8217;s going to be awesome! 

There is a price increase in Chicago on October 1st, so get signed up now!  Interesting note, our Race Director Mr. Mike Morris is flying out to the venue tonight to design the course &amp; obstacles this week so get ready for some mayhem!
Get registered HERE!

Malibu!  Spartan Race heads to the West Coast on November 19th and Heats are filling up fast!  We had to move the 9 &amp; 9:30 competitive heats to 8 &amp; 8:30 just to accommodate more racers!  We will have exciting new launches at this race as well&#8230;&#8230;.stay tuned ; ) And there will be a Hurricane Heat so keep your eyes opened for registration!  Register HERE!

Texas cash prize emails went out this week!  The cash prize heats will be selling out fast &#8211; top 10% were invited to compete for $10,000 for the first female and first male in the heat!  There will be a rad after party in Glen Rose so bring your dancing AND running shoes!  Register HERE!

Drinking game code words: &#8220;zombie&#8221; and/or &#8220;brains&#8221;.  
Holla!  (Not to be confused with hola) we hit the airwaves to talk Staten Island, Chicago, and even a little Texas.  We also had a special undead guest.  So, Staten Island, the Sept. 24 event Super Spartan Race presented by Dolphin Fitness of Staten Island, is an eight-plus mile Super Spartan &#8211; a trail run with over 15 obstacles. Competition is expected to attract 7,500 weekend warriors on Saturday, Sept. 24 at Wolfe&#8217;s Pond Park Preserve, Hylan Blvd. and Cornelia Avenue (between Seguine and Luten Avenues), Staten Island, N.Y. Races start at 9 a.m. and continue every 30 minutes until approximately 3 p.m. on both days. Children ages 5 to 13 can compete in the Junior Spartan Adventure on a specially-designed &#189;-mile course at 12:05 p.m. on Saturday. Proceeds benefit the Max Cure Foundation (www.maxcurefoundation.org).

We also talked about the Hurricane Heat which is making another appearance at a Spartan Race &#8211; bright and early 5:30 AM Saturday morning featuring Joe D, Carrie aka Shawty, Tom, and I think we may have talked Maurya into the craziness!  Tommy and Domenic shared their experiences in Amesbury where the heat was born.

We have a rad contest for free race entries &#8211; the I am Leonidas Contest
Free Spartan Race entry every day for the remainder of 2011 and a season pass for 2012 the last day of each month.  Click here: http://basno.com/7hhe1f5e, enter your email address to get your name in the hat, and then post the badge to confirm your entry!

Chicago is bringing the Hurricane Heat to the Windy City with a NIGHT HEAT!!!  It&#8217;s Death Race meets obstacle race you&#8217;ll get the chance to run with our founders and staffers from Spartan Race in a unique and memorable way. Beginning at 6:15 PM Friday, October 14th on the Cliffs Insane Terrain Park venue it will take you through the course in groups with the goal of just finishing the course. No chips, no clock, just a fun run Spartan-style that represents what our company and our athletes are about&#8230; getting up when you&#8217;re knocked down and finishing what you start.  Mandatory gear: Headlamp and Glow sticks! Additional mandatory gear will be supplied to those entered

Texas Championships include a $20,000 cash prize for the top male and female of the day.  The top 10% of the finishers from our 2011 series will be getting invited to participate in the special cash prize heat!  It&#8217;s going to be an amazing race - fast, muddy, and fully of water crossings!  Race Director Mike Morris says, &#8220;Compared to some of our other courses, this is a relatively flat, but there are still some quick ups and downs, super-cool technical sections, river crossings, and big, Texas style obstacles.  You will get wet, your lungs will burn, and you will have an awesome story to brag to your buddies about after finishing this course. 

Maurya&#8217;s Wimp to Spartan campaign is nearly complete when she toes the line in Staten Island.  Check out her newest blog post where she talks about her journey and there&#8217;s video footage.  Love it!  www.mscanspartan.blogspot.com

Zombie apocolypse?  Well, maybe not, but the Spartan Chicks are going to be doing some SpartanZombie chicking on October 22 in the inagural Zombie Run in Darlington, MD.  Zombie ambassador Ryan Goff joined us to talk about the race and how Spartan chicks will join the ranks in Zombieland for an amazing day of racing and a great after party! 

Check out their site for more details and come run for YOUR life on October 22nd.  More races are on the schedule for 2012!  www.runforyourlives.com

We talked about PA, the fact that Spartan has rad gear, rad chicks, and 2012 season of bad assness!  Maurya talked about her wimp to Spartan campaign courtesy of CrossFit South Brooklyn (Shane Williams is one cool dude) and we talked a lot about race day gear (NO COTTON).  Carrie told bad jokes, Maurya played with her hair, Margaret gave good information and Jim just tried to stay sane.

We hit half a million FB fans when Jared Griffin &#8220;liked&#8221; Spartan race at 4:29 CST on Wednesday, August 17th. Blake Davis guessed the time and scored a set of four entries to an upcoming Spartan Race! Show hosts, Shawty Carrie Adams and Jim Collison held down the fort and gave updates about and M_Scan was notably absent, but we carried on and even talked about the 2012 schedule!

      <itunes:summary>So, we had a pretty big week at Spartan last week. We hit half a million FB fans when Jared Griffin &#8220;liked&#8221; Spartan race at 4:29 CST on Wednesday, August 17th.
