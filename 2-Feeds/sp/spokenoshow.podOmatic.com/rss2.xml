      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1129223/600x600_880041.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here&#8217;s another one for all you lovers out there.  DJ LUVBUG and Suga Mama chose to take things a bit further on the erotic side with smooth sexy music and HOTT FIYAH spoken word...sure to get your mental juices flowin&#8217;

We mixed a smooth concoction of ol&#8217; skool jamz including artists like Walter Jackson, Marvin Gaye, Kleer, The Smith Connection, Donald Byrd, Chaka Khan, Rick James, and a few others.  We also got some super sexy poetry by Suga Mama and Mz. Denyce.

For more poetry from Mz. Denyce, you can visit www.myspace.com/d_qt or http://www.theblackpoetrycafeonline.com/

We thank each and every last one of you for tuning into the SPOKEN ORGASM SHOW and for downloading this FLYness &#61514;

Here&#8217;s a shout out to a few of the places that show us love:

New Jersey
Boston, Massachusetts
D-Troit, Michigan
Knoxville, TN
Niagra Falls Area

Louisiana
Oklahoma city
Kansas
Denver, CO
And last but not least of the US love is dedicated to my people in Cali - Los Angeles and surrounding areas&#8230;mad mad love to ya&#8217;ll!  If it wasn&#8217;t for one particular, super special, man in LA, this show wouldn&#8217;t be happnin&#8217; right now&#8230;.don&#8217;t worry baby, you will make it home soon&#8230;.love you&#8230;
