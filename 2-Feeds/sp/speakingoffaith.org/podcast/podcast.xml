   <title>Getting Revenge and Forgiveness (May 24, 2012)</title>
   <description>Michael McCullough describes science that helps us comprehend how revenge came to have a purpose in human life. At the same time, he stresses, science is also revealing that human beings are more instinctively equipped for forgiveness than we've perhaps given ourselves credit for. Knowing this suggests ways to calm the revenge instinct in ourselves and others and embolden the forgiveness intuition.</description>

   <title>The Last Quiet Places (May 10, 2012)</title>
   <description>Gordon Hempton says that silence is an endangered species. He defines real quiet as presence -- not an absence of sound, but an absence of noise. The Earth, as he knows it, is a 'solar-powered jukebox' and quiet is a 'think tank of the soul.' We take in the world through his ears.</description>

   <title>The Body's Grace (May 3, 2012) [encore]</title>
   <description>Matthew Sanford says he's never seen anyone live more deeply in their body -- in all of its grace and all of its flaws -- without becoming more compassionate toward all of life. He is a renowned yoga teacher, and he has been paralyzed from the chest down since he was 13. He teaches yoga to the able-bodied and adapts yoga for people with ailments and disabilities, including military veterans. With Krista Tippett, he shares his story on finding his own way in to what we call the mind-body connection, and what might be discovered there. His wisdom holds lessons for how all of us can fully inhabit our bodies across the span of our lives.</description>

   <title>Contemplating Mortality (April 26, 2012)</title>
   <description>What if we understand death as a developmental stage -- like adolescence or mid-life? Dr. Ira Byock is a leading figure in palliative care and hospice in the United States. He says we lose sight of "the remarkable value" of the time of life we call dying if we forget that it's always a personal and human event, and not just a medical one. From his place on this medical frontier, he shares how we can understand dying as a time of learning, repair, and completion of our lives.</description>

   <description>Sitting Bull is best known for defeating General Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn. But for many Lakota, his resistance to federal appropriation of sacred lands reflects humility towards the land and compassion towards his people -- with his death 120 years ago being his ultimate moment of sacrifice.

   <title>Remembering God (April 12, 2012)</title>
   <description>The poet Christian Wiman is giving voice to the hunger for faith -- and the challenges of faith -- for people living now. After a Texas upbringing soaked in a history of violence and a charismatic Christian culture, he was agnostic until he became actively religious again in his late 30s. Then he was diagnosed with a rare form of incurable blood cancer. He's bearing witness to something new happening in himself and in the world.</description>

   <title>What We Nurture (March 29, 2012) [encore]</title>

And, in a light-hearted moment that is an audience pleaser, Boorstein shares what GPS might teach us about &quot;recalculating&quot; and our own inner equanimity.</description>

   <description>How do we prime our brains to take the meandering mental paths necessary for creativity? New techniques of brain imaging, neuropsychologist Rex Jung says, are helping us gain a whole new view on the differences between intelligence, creativity, and personality. He unsettles some old assumptions -- and suggests some new connections between creativity and family life, creativity and aging, and creativity and purpose.</description>

   <title>The Losses and the Laughter We Grow Into (March 15, 2012)</title>
   <description>Being able-bodied, Kevin Kling says, is always only a temporary condition. Part funny guy, part poet and playwright, part wise man, Kling is known for NPR commentaries in his Minnesota accent that sounds straight out of the movie Fargo. With Krista Tippett, you'll hear his own special angle on life's humor and its ruptures. Born with a partially disabled left arm, in his 40s he then lost the use of his fully functional right one after a motorcycle accident nearly killed him. Take in his wisdom on the losses we're born with, and the losses we grow into -- and why we turn these things into stories.</description>

   <title>The Ecstatic Faith of Rumi (March 8, 2012) [encore]</title>
   <description>The 13th-century mystic and poet Rumi is a best-selling author in the modern West who has long influenced Islamic thought and spirituality, though his Muslim identity is often lost in translation. Enter the exuberant world of Rumi with Iranian-American poet and scholar Fatemeh Keshavarz. Delve into why Rumi matters in our time and how he understood searching and restlessness as a kind of arrival. And through a lush production of his words and poetry -- layered in Persian and English -- experience how he saw every form of human love as a mirror of the divine. And, how Rumi inspired the whirling dervishes.</description>

   <itunes:summary>The 13th-century mystic and poet Rumi is a best-selling author in the modern West who has long influenced Islamic thought and spirituality, though his Muslim identity is often lost in translation. Enter the exuberant world of Rumi with Iranian-American poet and scholar Fatemeh Keshavarz. Delve into why Rumi matters in our time and how he understood searching and restlessness as a kind of arrival. And through a lush production of his words and poetry -- layered in Persian and English -- experience how he saw every form of human love as a mirror of the divine. And, how Rumi inspired the whirling dervishes.</itunes:summary>

   <title>Uncovering the Codes for Reality (March 01, 2012)</title>
   <description>Could codes like we see in computer programs be in the DNA of the cosmos? The physicist James Gates is a leading string theorist who is evolving mathematics to convey truth much like poetry does. He reveals why string theory stretches our imaginations about the fundamental nature of reality. And he shares what his life in science has taught him about how fallibility makes us more complete, and imagination makes us more knowledgeable.</description>

   <title>Meredith Monk's Voice (February 16, 2012)</title>
   <description>Meredith Monk is a kind of archeologist of the human voice. She says that "the voice could be like the body" -- flexible and fluid with practice. Through music as through meditation, the longtime Buddhist practitioner pushes the boundaries of what we can do without words. And she tells Krista Tippett what she's learned about mercy and impermanence, spirit and play. A lush hour of music and thought not to be forgotten.</description>

   <title>The Inner Landscape of Beauty (January 26, 2012) [encore]</title>   
   <description>John O&apos;Donohue was an Irish poet and philosopher beloved for his insistence on beauty as a human calling and a defining aspect of God. The human soul hungers for beauty, John O&apos;Donohue insisted, and we feel most alive in its presence. It returns us often in fleeting but sustaining moments to our highest selves. And a neglect of beauty, he believed, is at the heart of our deepest modern crises.</description>

   <itunes:subtitle>John O&apos;Donohue discusses the role beauty plays in human life and spirituality.</itunes:subtitle>   
   <itunes:summary>John O&apos;Donohue was an Irish poet and philosopher beloved for his insistence on beauty as a human calling and a defining aspect of God. The human soul hungers for beauty, John O&apos;Donohue insisted, and we feel most alive in its presence. It returns us often in fleeting but sustaining moments to our highest selves. And a neglect of beauty, he believed, is at the heart of our deepest modern crises.</itunes:summary>

   <description>Journalist Joanna Brooks gives us an inside view of this "Mormon moment" of American life, a moment of deepened self-searching with the emergence of a viable Mormon presidential candidate. Brooks, who writes the blog, "Ask Mormon Girl," describes herself as unorthodox, but still passionately planted in this culture that is as much an identity as a faith.</description>

   <title>A Voice for the Animals with Dr. Alan Rabinowitz (October 13, 2011) [encore]</title>
   <description>A profound stutter as a child left Alan Rabinowitz virtually unable to communicate and to prefer animals to people. He became a wildlife biologist and made his name as an explorer in some of the world's last wild places -- discovering new animal species, encountering human communities believed to be lost, and most of all working for the survival of the world's endangered big cats. We hear about his extraordinary insights into the animal-human bond; and also about the dramatic personal odyssey that has brought him across the years to rediscover &quot;the human side of things&quot; -- both in life, and in the evolving science of wildlife conservation.</description>

   <description>Sherry Turkle&apos;s book, &quot;Alone Together,&quot; created a catchword for anxiety about the alienating potential of technology. But that&apos;s not really her message. We explore the real challenge she poses -- that we can and must lead examined lives with our digital objects -- actively shaping technology to human purposes.</description>

   <title>Words That Shimmer with Elizabeth Alexander [The Civil Conversations Project] (July 28, 2011) [encore]</title>
   <description>Poetry is something many of us seem to be hungry for these days. We&apos;re hungry for fresh ways to tell hard truths and redemptive stories, for language that would elevate and embolden rather than demean and alienate. Elizabeth Alexander shares her sense of what poetry works in us -- and in our children -- and why it may become more relevant, not less so, in hard and complicated times.</description>

   <title>Lovingkindness (Metta) Meditation with Sylvia Boorstein [audio extra]</title>

We explore the real challenge she poses -- that we can and must lead examined lives with our digital objects -- actively shaping technology to human purposes.</itunes:summary>

   <title>A Wild Love for the World (March 17, 2011) [encore]</title>
   <description>Joanna Macy is a Buddhist philosopher of ecology and an exquisite translator of the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke. We take that poetry as a lens on her wisdom, at 81, about the great dramas of our time: ecological, political, and personal. Rilke sought the shape of meaning in a now-vanished central Europe at the turn of the last century. Joanna Macy&apos;s vision took shape in crucibles of the 20th century; she sees us at a pivotal moment in history -- with possibilities of unraveling, or of creating a life-sustaining human society.</description>

   <description>Science and religion are often pitted against one another; but how do they complement, rather than contradict, one another? Physicist and theologian John Polkinghorne applies the deepest insights of modern physics to think about how the world fundamentally works, and how the universe might make space for prayer.</description>

   <title>Words That Shimmer (January 6, 2011)</title>
   <description>Poetry is something many of us seem to be hungry for these days. We&apos;re hungry for fresh ways to tell hard truths and redemptive stories, for language that would elevate and embolden rather than demean and alienate. Elizabeth Alexander shares her sense of what poetry works in us -- and in our children -- and why it may become more relevant, not less so, in hard and complicated times.</description>

   <title>A Wild Love for the World (September 16, 2010)</title>
   <description>Joanna Macy is a Buddhist philosopher of ecology and an exquisite translator of the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke. We take that poetry as a lens on her wisdom, at 81, about the great dramas of our time: ecological, political, and personal. Rilke sought the shape of meaning in a now-vanished central Europe at the turn of the last century. Joanna Macy&apos;s vision took shape in crucibles of the 20th century; she sees us at a pivotal moment in history -- with possibilities of unraveling, or of creating a life-sustaining human society.</description>

   <description>We&apos;ll delve into the world and meaning of the approaching Jewish High Holy Days -- ten days that span the new year of Rosh Hashanah through Yom Kippur&apos;s rituals of atonement. Sharon Brous, a young rabbi in L.A., is one voice in a Jewish spiritual renaissance that is taking many forms across the U.S. The vast majority of her congregation are people in their 20s and 30s, who, she says, are making life-giving connections between ritual, personal transformation, and relevance in the world.</description>

   <description>Jacqueline Novogratz is bringing a new term, "patient capitalism," to the global economic table. She runs the Acumen Fund, which is charting a third way between investment for profit and aid for free. It has a strong moral -- even spiritual -- core, and its investors&apos; returns come not in money but in social change.  </description>

   <title>A Voice for the Animals (July 22, 2010)</title>
   <description>A profound stutter as a child left Alan Rabinowitz virtually unable to communicate and to prefer animals to people. He became a wildlife biologist and made his name as an explorer in some of the world&apos;s last wild places -- discovering new animal species, encountering human communities believed to be lost, and most of all working for the survival of the world&apos;s endangered big cats -- lions, jaguars, tigers. We hear about his extraordinary insights into the animal-human bond; and also about the dramatic personal odyssey that has brought him across the years to rediscover &quot;the human side of things&quot; -- both in life, and in the evolving science of wildlife conservation. </description>

   <title>The Ethics of Eating (July 15, 2010) [encore]</title>
   <description>Barbara Kingsolver describes an adventure her family undertook to spend one year eating primarily what they could grow or raise themselves. As a citizen and mother more than an expert, she turned her life towards questions many of us are asking. Food, she says, is a &quot;rare moral arena&quot; in which the ethical choice is often the pleasurable choice.</description>

   <title>A Monastic Revolution (July 1, 2010) [encore]</title>
   <description>Shane Claiborne is a leading spirit in a gathering movement of young people known as the New Monastics. Emerging from the edges of Evangelical Christianity, they are patterning their lives in response to the needs of the poor -- and the detachment they see in our culture&apos;s vision of adulthood. With virtues like simplicity and imagination, Shane Claiborne and his community, The Simple Way, are taking on the gap between the churches they were raised in and in what they perceive as the essence of Christianity.</description>

   <title>The Spirituality of Parenting (June 17, 2010) [encore]</title>
   <description>More and more people in our time are disconnected from religious institutions, or find themselves creating a family with a spouse from another tradition or no tradition at all. We sense that there is a spiritual aspect to our children&apos;s natures and wonder how to support and nurture that. Our guest, Rabbi Sandy Sasso, says the spiritual life begins not in abstractions, but in concrete everyday experiences. And children need our questions as much as our answers.</description>

   <title>Preserving Words and Worlds (May 6, 2010) [encore]</title>
   <description>We travel to a monastic library that rescues manuscripts from across the centuries and across the world. And there are worlds in this place on palm leaf and papyrus, in microfilm and pixels -- stories of ordinary life as well as the rise and fall of civilizations. We explore this with Fr. Columba Stewart, a Benedictine monk and its executive director, and Getachew Haile, an Ethiopian scholar who has led some of its most intriguing work. In their lives as in this work, the relevance of ancient manuscripts to people of the present, and the cultural cargo of the past itself, are revealed in a new light.</description>

   <title>Getting Revenge and Forgiveness (March 25, 2010) [encore]</title>
   <description>Michael McCullough describes science that helps us comprehend how revenge came to have a purpose in human life. At the same time, he stresses,  science is also revealing that human beings are more instinctively equipped for forgiveness than we&apos;ve perhaps given ourselves credit for. Knowing this suggests ways to calm the revenge instinct in ourselves and others and embolden the forgiveness intuition.</description>

   <description>Robert Wright&apos;s book, &quot;The Evolution of God,&quot; charts an intellectual path beyond the faith versus reason debate. He takes a relentlessly logical look at the history of religion, exposing its contradictions. Yet Wright also traces something &quot;revelatory&quot; moving through human history. In this public conversation -- recorded before a live audience -- we explore the story he tells, the import he sees in it for our culture, and where it has personally taken him.</description>

They tell of a gathering network of survivors who share their grief, their stories of loved ones, and their ideas for lasting peace.

We open up the subject of prayer and explore how it sounds and what it means in three different traditions and lives -- with Anoushka Shankar, Stephen Mitchell, and Roberta Bondi.</itunes:summary>

   <title>The Spiritual Audacity of Abraham Joshua Heschel (December 3, 2009)</title>
   <description>Heschel insisted that the opposite of good is not evil, it is indifference. Born into an esteemed Hasidic family in Poland in 1907, he was a mystic who wrote transcendent, poetic words about God. At the same time, he marched alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and organized religious leadership against the war in Vietnam, embodying the social activism of the biblical prophets he studied. We explore Heschel&apos;s teachings and his prophetic legacy -- his &quot;spiritual audacity&quot; -- for people in our time.</description>

   <title>The Freelance Monotheism of Karen Armstrong (November 5, 2009)</title>
   <description>Karen Armstrong speaks about her progression from a disillusioned and damaged young nun into, in her words, a &quot;freelance monotheist.&quot; She&apos;s a formidable thinker and scholar, but as a theologian she calls herself an amateur -- noting that the Latin root of the word &quot;amateur&quot; means a love of one&apos;s subject. Seven years in a strict religious order nearly snuffed out her ability to think about faith at all. Here, we hear the story behind Armstrong&apos;s developing ideas about God.</description>

   <title>Jaroslav Pelikan and the Need for Creeds (October 22, 2009)</title>
   <description>For many modern Americans, the very idea of reciting an unchanging creed, composed centuries ago, is troublesome. But, the late Jaroslav Pelikan was a scholar who devoted his life to exploring the vitality of ancient theology and creeds. He insisted that even modern pluralists need strong statements of belief. We revisit Krista&apos;s 2003 conversation with him, as they discuss the history and nature of creeds, and how a fixed creed can be reconciled with an honest, intellectual faith that changes and evolves.</description>

   <description>Ibrahim Al-Marashi, our second voice in Revealing Ramadan, is a scholar of modern history with a focus on the Middle East and political communications. His profile was heightened when an article he wrote in 2002 was plagiarized by the British and American governments to justify the invasion of Iraq. An Iraqi-American, he grew up and studied in California and has taught in the U.S., Turkey, and currently in Spain. The curiosity that took him to Madrid flows into the Ramadan story he likes to tell.</description>

	  <title>The Novelist as God (August 20, 2009)</title>
	  <description>Mary Doria Russell has grappled with large moral and religious questions on and off the page. We discover what she discerned -- in the act of creating a new universe -- about God and about dilemmas of evil, doubt, and free will. The ultimate moral of any life and any event, she believes, only shows itself across generations. And so the novelist, like God, she says, paints with the brush of time.</description>

		  <itunes:summary>Diane Winston appreciates good television, studies it, and brings many of its creators into her religion and media classes at the University of Southern California. In what some have called a renaissance in television drama, we examine how TV is helping us tell our story and work through great confusions in contemporary life. And, we play clips from &quot;The Wire,&quot; House,&quot; &quot;Lost,&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.</itunes:summary>

	  <title>The Science of Trust: Economics and Virtue (July 9, 2009)</title>
	  <description>In a few breathtaking months, we&apos;ve culturally moved from seeing Wall Street as an icon of thriving civil society to discussing its workings with book titles like &quot;House of Cards&quot; and &quot;Animal Spirits.&quot; As part of our ongoing Repossessing Virtue series, we&apos;ll talk to pioneering neuroeconomist Paul Zak. We look at what science is learning about trust, fair play, and empathy -- and what these qualities have to do with human character and economics.</description>

	  <title>Joe Carter and the Legacy of the African-American Spiritual (June 18, 2009)</title>
	  <description>The spiritual is celebrated in American culture and beyond. It is the source from which gospel, jazz, blues, and hip-hop evolved. It was born in the American South, created by slaves, bards whose names history never recorded. We celebrate the life of Joe Carter, who explored the meaning of the Negro spiritual in word and song -- through its hidden meanings, as well as its beauty, lament, and hope.</description>

	   <title>Repossessing Virtue: Living Differently, Beyond Economic Crisis (May 14, 2009)</title>
	   <description>A new installment in our ongoing series, Repossessing Virtue, bringing the voices of our listeners into the conversation we&apos;ve been building online and on-air since the economic downturn began last year. Many are grappling with the shame that comes in American culture with the loss of a job, and many are seeking community in old places and new. For some, economic instability -- a kind of life on the edge -- is not new. They&apos;ve been cultivating virtues of patience, self-examination, service and good humor that might help us all.</description>

   <title>The Spirituality of Parenting (May 7, 2009)</title>
   <description>More and more people in our time are disconnected from religious institutions, or find themselves creating a family with a spouse from another tradition or no tradition at all. We sense that there is a spiritual aspect to our children&apos;s natures and wonder how to support and nurture that. Our guest, Rabbi Sandy Sasso, says the spiritual life begins not in abstractions, but in concrete everyday experiences. And children need our questions as much as our answers.</description>

	   <title>The Biology of the Spirit (March 12, 2009)</title>
	   <description>Former surgeon Sherwin Nuland reflects on the meaning of life by way of scrupulous and elegant detail about human physiology. He speaks about his sense of wonder at the body&apos;s capacity to sustain life and support our pursuits of order and meaning, and why he believes the human spirit is an evolutionary accomplishment of the brain. The three-pound human brain, he says, is the most complex structure that has ever existed on this planet.</description>

	   <description>The second program in our ongoing series on moral and spiritual aspects of living in and beyond economic crisis, this time with wise voices from religion, science, industry, and the arts -- including Rachel Naomi Remen, Prabhu Guptara, Sharon Salzberg, Martin Marty, Esther Sternberg, Anchee Min, Majora Carter, and Vigen Guroian.. As the economy has faltered, we&apos;ve grasped to understand what went wrong, and how. But beneath economic explanations and remedies, these questions compel us to other kinds of reflection: On qualities of human nature that ultimately determine economies and markets; on qualities of humanity that we want to cultivate in ourselves and our children. How will we redefine what matters in this moment? Who will we be for each other?</description>

   <itunes:summary>The Harvard Humanist chaplain Greg Epstein finds that these economic times have prompted him to think about community and activism differently. He finds humanists and atheists are learning to define themselves in terms of activism and outreach rather than just protesting the religious faithful.</itunes:summary>

   <title>Preserving Words and Worlds (January 15, 2009)</title>
   <description>We travel to a monastic library that rescues manuscripts from across the centuries and across the world. And there are worlds in this place on palm leaf and papyrus, in microfilm and pixels -- stories of ordinary life as well as the rise and fall of civilizations. We explore this with Fr. Columba Stewart, a Benedictine monk and its executive director, and Getachew Haile, an Ethiopian scholar who has led some of its most intriguing work. In their lives as in this work, the relevance of ancient manuscripts to people of the present, and the cultural cargo of the past itself, are revealed in a new light.</description>

	  <title>A History of Doubt (January 8, 2009)</title>
   <description>Poet and historian Jennifer Michael Hecht says that as a scholar she always noticed the &quot;shadow history&quot; of doubt out of the corner of her eye. She shows how non-belief, skepticism, and doubt have paralleled and at times shaped the world&apos;s great religious and secular belief systems. She suggests that only in modern time has doubt been narrowly equated with a complete rejection of faith, or a broader sense of mystery.</description>

   <description>Our SOF First Person series continues with Benedictine nun and author Joan Chittister. She&apos;s been thinking and writing about Christmas, the prism through which economic crisis is coming home uncomfortably to many of us right now. The gold, frankincense, and myrrh of the kingly biblical gift-givers, she&apos;s learned, are not displays of wealth but of blessings of character -- generosity, serenity, and spirit.

   <title>SOF FIRST PERSON (audio) | Repossessing Virtue: Prabhu Guptara on Applying Personal Moral Sense to One&apos;s Work Life</title>
   <description>As promised, we continue our SOF First Person project by turning to Swiss banking expert, Prabhu Guptara. Several years ago, Krista spoke with Guptara when the fallout of the Enron scandal was wreaking havoc on the U.S. economy and shaking investor confidence in corporate practices and business fundamentals. His message was simple but challenging, and also quite liberating for much of our audience -- bring your personal values into the workplace. For Guptara, doing this is one of the best ways of making ethical decisions that will lead to moral integrity -- and less corruption and scandal.</description>

   <title>The Sunni-Shia Divide and the Future of Islam (November 20, 2008)</title>
   <description>We seek fresh insight into the history and the human and religious dynamics of Islam&apos;s Sunni-Shia divide. Vali Nasr says that it is not so different from dynamics in periods of Western Christian history. But he says that by bringing the majority Shia to power in Iraq, the U.S. has changed the religions dynamics of the Middle East.</description>

     <title>Getting Revenge and Forgiveness (November 6, 2008)</title>
     <description>Professor of psychology Michael McCullough describes science that helps us comprehend how revenge came to have a purpose in human life. At the same time, he stresses, science is also revealing that human beings are more instinctively equipped for forgiveness than we&apos;ve perhaps given ourselves credit for. Knowing this suggests ways to calm the revenge instinct in ourselves and others and embolden the forgiveness intuition.</description>

		   <itunes:summary>The second part of our examination of religious energies below the surface of the 2008 presidential campaign. Conservative columnist Rod Dreher is an outspoken critic of mainstream Republican economic and environmental ideas and the conduct of the Iraq war, but he voted for George W. Bush twice. We explore the little-known story of religiously-influenced impulses within the conservative movement that diverge from the Religious Right.</itunes:summary>

		   <description>We&apos;ll delve into the world and meaning of the approaching Jewish High Holy Days -- ten days that span the new year of Rosh Hashanah through Yom Kippur&apos;s rituals of atonement. Sharon Brous, a young rabbi in L.A., is one voice in a Jewish spiritual renaissance that is taking many forms across the U.S. The vast majority of her congregation are people in their 20s and 30s, who, she says, are making life-giving connections between ritual, personal transformation, and relevance in the world.</description>

		   <title>The Origins and Impact of Pentecostalism (September 18, 2008)</title>
		   <description>Pentecostalism has appeared as a force on both sides of the current presidential campaign. News coverage of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin&apos;s Pentecostal background has overshadowed the fact that senior leaders of the Obama campaign and the Democratic National Convention are Pentecostal too. In 2006, Pentecostals from all around the globe traveled to the birthplace of this tradition -- Azusa Street in Los Angeles. We were there to cover the centennial celebration -- and now we bring this program into the present, exploring the origins, theology, and impact of this faith that now reaches an estimated half a billion people globally.</description>

	   <title>Fishing with Mystery (August 28, 2008)</title>
	   <description>James Prosek is a 33-year-old artist, writer, and fly-fisher who has always, as he puts it, found God &quot;through the theater of nature.&quot; From a young age he has been fascinated by trout, and now eel -- which he sees as &quot;mystical creatures&quot; -- and he&apos;s captured them physically and artistically, by way of both angling and paint. We explore the sense of meaning and ritual James Prosek developed along the way, including his concern with how we humans limit our sense of other creatures by the names we give them. We&apos;ll also hear the words of Henry David Thoreau, Bruce Chatwin, and Izaak Walton.</description>

   <title>The Power of Eckhart Tolle&apos;s Now (August 14, 2008)</title>
   <description>Host Krista Tippett creates a certain kind of space in her interviews, and this conversation is no exception. Tolle shares his youthful experience of depression and despair -- suffering that led him to his own spiritual breakthrough, and ultimately, freedom and peace of mind. He also explicates his view of what he calls &quot;the pain body&quot; -- the accumulated emotional pain that may influence us and our relationships in negative ways. And Tolle talks about spirit and God, and what those concepts mean to him.</description>

   <title>Living Vodou (August 7, 2008)</title>
   <description>Vodou is the African-based spiritual world of the people of Haiti, a living religion wherever Haitians are found. It involves dramatic rituals and drumming, trances and dreaming, and belief in a spiritual realm that mirrors the physical world and interacts with it. But contrary to popular notions, it has nothing to do with sticking pins into dolls. With Patrick Bellegarde-Smith, a scholar who is also a Vodou priest, we explore its practices and metaphysics.</description>

     <title>Recovering Chinese Religiosities (July 17, 2008)</title>
     <description>Put the words &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;China&quot; in a sentence together, and Western imaginations may go to indifference at best, to brutal repression at worst. Yet in grand historical perspective, China is a crucible of religious and philosophical thought and practice. Anthropologist and filmmaker Mayfair Yang says that the upheavals of the 20th century created an amnesia -— in the West as in China itself -- about this rich, pluralistic spiritual inheritance. She traces some of this story for us, and describes a subtle new revival of reverence and ritual.</description>

     <title>Joe Carter and the Legacy of the African-American Spiritual (July 10, 2008)</title>
     <description>The spiritual is celebrated in American culture and beyond. It is the source from which gospel, jazz, blues and hip-hop evolved. It was born in the American South, created by slaves, bards whose names history never recorded. The organizing concept of this music is not the melody of Europe, but the rhythm of Africa. And the theology conveyed in these songs is a potent mix of African spirituality, Hebrew narrative, Christian doctrine, and an extreme experience of human suffering.</description>

     <title>The Ethics of Eating (July 3, 2008)</title>
     <description>Author Barbara Kingsolver describes an adventure her family undertook to spend one year eating primarily what they could grow or raise themselves. As a citizen and mother more than an expert, she turned her life towards questions many of us are asking. Food, she says, is a &quot;rare moral arena&quot; in which the ethical choice is often the pleasurable choice.</description>

     <description>Kate Braestrup is a writer, mother and a chaplain to game wardens on search-and-rescue missions in Maine.

     <description>Karen Armstrong speaks about her progression from a disillusioned and damaged young nun into, in her words, a &quot;freelance monotheist.&quot; She&apos;s a formidable thinker and scholar, but as a theologian she calls herself an amateur -- noting that the Latin root of the word &quot;amateur&quot; means a love of one&apos;s subject. Seven years in a strict religious order nearly snuffed out her ability to think about faith at all. Here, we hear the story behind Armstrong&apos;s developing ideas about God.</description>

     <description>More and more people in our time are disconnected from religious institutions, at least for part of their lives. Others are religious and find themselves creating a family with a spouse from another tradition or no tradition at all. And the experience of parenting tends to raise spiritual questions anew. We sense that there is a spiritual aspect to our children&apos;s natures and wonder how to support and nurture that. The spiritual life, our guest says, begins not in abstractions, but in concrete everyday experiences. And children need our questions as much as our answers.</description>

     <title>Exploring a New Humanism (March 27, 2008)</title>
     <description>In a recent Pew poll, 16 percent of Americans identified themselves as &quot;unaffiliated&quot; - atheist, agnostic, or most prominently &quot;nothing in particular.&quot; Greg Epstein, a Humanist chaplain at Harvard, described himself that way until he discovered the tradition of humanism. He is passionate about articulating an atheist identity that is not driven by a stance against religion but by positive ethical beliefs and actions.</description>

   <title>SOF EXTRA (video) | Bach&apos;s Bible</title>
   <description>Johann Sebastian Bach&apos;s compositions, Dr. Thomas Rossin says, stemmed from his private faith - a faith evidenced by Bach&apos;s handwritten notes in his Bible. Hear about the Bible&apos;s nomadic journey and its possible influence of his &quot;Mass in B Minor&quot; - what the late, great scholar of creeds, Jaroslav Pelikan, holds up as an example of the &quot;best we&apos;ve ever done.&quot;</description>

   <title>The Need for Creeds (March 20, 2008)</title>
   <description>For many modern Americans, the very idea of reciting an unchanging creed, composed centuries ago, is troublesome. But, Jaroslav Pelikan, who died on May 13, 2006, was a scholar who devoted his life to exploring the vitality of ancient theology and creeds. He insisted that even modern pluralists need strong statements of belief. Here, we revisit Krista&apos;s 2003 conversation with him, who, then, in his 80th year, had released a historic collection of Christian faith from biblical times to the present and from across the globe. They discuss the history and nature of creeds, and how a fixed creed can be reconciled with an honest, intellectual faith that changes and evolves.</description>

   <title>Liberating the Founders (March 13, 2008)</title>
   <description>Warning: this conversation may not mirror what you learned in school. The culture wars of recent years, journalist Steven Waldman says, hijacked Americans&apos; understanding of the country&apos;s founders and of the meaning of religious liberty. This hinders people from grasping what is really at stake in the current debates about the relationship between government and religion. It may even distort the wisdom we might bring to young democracies around the world.</description>

   <title>The Inner Landscape of Beauty (February 28, 2008)</title>
   <description>John O&apos;Donohue was an Irish poet and philosopher beloved for his book &quot;Anam Cara&quot; — Gaelic for &quot;soul friend&quot; — and for his insistence on beauty as a human calling and a defining aspect of God. Before his untimely death this year, he spoke with Krista in our studios. And so this hour has become a remembrance of him. But John O&apos;Donohue had a very Celtic, lifelong fascination with what he called &quot;the invisible world.&quot; And he would also surely see this also as a serendipitous continuation of his life&apos;s work — of bringing ancient Celtic wisdom to modern confusions and longings.</description>

   <title>Whale Songs and Elephant Loves (February 21, 2008)</title>
   <description>Katy Payne is an acoustic biologist with a Quaker sensibility. In a career that has spanned the wild coast of Argentina and the rainforests of Africa, she discovered that humpback whales compose ever-changing songs; and that elephants communicate across long distances by way of sounds beyond the realm of human hearing. She reflects on life in this world through listening to two of its largest and most mysterious creatures.</description>

   <title>No More Taking Sides (February 14, 2008)</title>
   <description>Robi Damelin lost her son David to a Palestinian sniper. Ali Abu Awwad lost his older brother Yousef to an Israeli soldier. But, instead of clinging to traditional ideologies and turning their pain into more violence, they&apos;ve decided to understand the other side -- Israeli and Palestinian -- by sharing their pain and their humanity. They tell of a gathering network of survivors who share their grief, their stories of loved ones, and their ideas for lasting peace. They don&apos;t want to be right; they want to be honest.</description>

   <title>Reflections of a British Muslim Extremist (February 7, 2008)</title>
   <description>British activist Ed Husain was seduced, at the age of 16, by revolutionary Islamist ideals that flourished at the heart of educated British culture. Yet he later shrank back from radicalism after coming close to a murder and watching people he loved become suicide bombers. He dug deeper into Islamic spirituality, and now offers a fresh and daring perspective on the way forward.</description>

   <title>Inside Mormon Faith (January 24, 2008)</title>
   <description>Americans have been hearing about Mormonism in the context of the presidential campaign. But we&apos;re learning about this faith of 13 million people indirectly, by way of rhetoric and defense. In this program, we avoid well-trodden, controversial ground and seek an understanding of some doctrinal and spiritual basics of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Robert Millet, a leading scholar of the church and a lifelong practitioner, describes a developing young religion with distinct mystical and practical interpretations of the nature of God, family, and eternity.</description>

   <title>Diplomacy and Religion in the 21st Century (January 3, 2008)</title>
   <description>The greatest threat in the post-Cold War world, says Douglas Johnston, is the prospective marriage of religious extremism with weapons of mass destruction. Yet the U.S. spends most of its time, resources, and weapons fighting the symptoms of this threat, not the cause. The diplomacy of the future, he is showing, must engage religion as part of the strategic solution to global conflicts.</description>

   <title>SOF EXTRA (video) | The Homes and Voices of Mason&apos;s Bend</title>
   <description>Auburn University&apos;s Rural Studio in western Alabama draws architectural students into the design and construction of homes and public spaces in some of the poorest counties in the United States. They&apos;re creating beautiful and economical structures that are unique in the world — and that nurture sustainability of the natural world as of human dignity. The iconographic structures of Mason&apos;s Bend have become synonymous with Sam Mockbee and the Rural Studio. We&apos;ve put together a feast of images and voices from the people who live and work there.

   <title>SOF EXTRA (audio) | Krista&apos;s Commentary on Consumption and Sustainability</title>
   <description>Krista says the globe should welcome the challenge of sustainability as an invitation -- a way to strengthen moral resources such as delight, dignity, elegance, and hope: 
			
			Our emerging national conversation about sustainability has a decidedly &quot;eat your spinach&quot; tone. We&apos;re steeling ourselves to enter the realm of sacrifice, and penance. But as I&apos;ve explored ethics and meaning in American life these past few years, I&apos;ve been struck by the heightened sense of delight and beauty in lives and communities pursuing a new alignment with the natural world. 
			
			Innovation in sustainability often begins, I&apos;ve found, with people defining what they cherish as much as diagnosing what is wrong. I think of Majora Carter. The cutting-edge project she founded, Sustainable South Bronx, began when she and the people of that borough began to reclaim their riverfront for refreshment and play. 
			
			I think also of the author Barbara Kingsolver, who found in a year of sustainable eating that when it comes to food, the ethical choice is also the pleasurable choice. And she says that as we face the grand ecological crises of our time, one of our most important renewable resources is hope. We simply have to put it on with our shoes every morning. 
			
			Recently we visited the Rural Studio at Auburn University in Alabama. There, architectural students build elegant homes and public spaces in poor communities. Long before sustainability was fashionable, the Rural Studio was innovating &quot;zero-maintenance&quot; design. This architectural philosophy shelters the body while honoring the environment and human dignity. 
			
			The writer Frederich Buechner has said that &quot;vocation&quot; happens when our deep gladness meets the world&apos;s deep need. I&apos;d like to propose the work of sustainability as an unfolding vocation – not merely a response to problems, but an invitation to possibility and a way to strengthen moral resources such as delight, dignity, elegance, and hope.</description>

   <title>An Architecture of Decency (November 15, 2007)</title>
   <description>We travel to western Alabama to the Rural Studio. Scattered across it are some 75 works of livable art — elegant, sustainable homes and public buildings in some of the poorest counties in the United States. They&apos;re the products of an architectural adventure. Here, architecture serves as a &quot;social art&quot; — and as a force for repairing the fabric of human community as well as the natural world.</description>

   <title>The Ethics of Eating (July 19, 2007)</title>
   <description>Author Barbara Kingsolver describes an adventure her family undertook to spend one year eating primarily what they could grow or raise themselves. As a citizen and mother more than an expert, she turned her life towards questions many of us are asking. What can climate change and sustainability really have to do my family&apos;s daily routines? Where does the food we eat come from? And why do we resist when the healthiest choices can be a delight?</description>

   <title>Marriage, Family, and Divorce (July 5, 2007)</title>
   <description>American ideals of courtship and marriage echo with Biblical imagery — &quot;bone of my bones&quot; &quot;flesh of my flesh.&quot; But what does the Bible really say, and how has it been taught across the centuries in which the institution of marriage has changed dramatically? With a rabbi and a New Testament scholar, we explore nuances of biblical teachings about marriage, family, and divorce — the surprising ambiguities of the New Testament and the striking practicality of Jewish tradition across the ages.</description>

   <title>Living Vodou (June 28, 2007)</title>
   <description>Vodou is the African-based spiritual world of the people of Haiti, a living religion wherever Haitians are found. It involves dramatic rituals and drumming, trances and dreaming, and belief in a spiritual realm that mirrors the physical world and interacts with it. But contrary to popular notions, it has nothing to do with sticking pins into dolls. With Patrick Bellegarde-Smith, a scholar who is also a Vodou priest, we explore its practices and metaphysics.</description>

   <description>A film based on Mariane Pearl&apos;s memoir, &quot;A Mighty Heart,&quot; opens in theaters, with Angelina Jolie in the starring role.

   <title>Joe Carter and the Legacy of the African-American Spiritual (June 14, 2007)</title>
   <description>We celebrate the life of performer, educator, and humanitarian Joe Carter with his exploration in word and song of the meaning of the African-American spiritual. Before his death last year at the age of 57, he traveled the world and introduced the spiritual to audiences from Novosibirsk to Nigeria. He had a singular understanding of the religious sensibility of this music -- its hidden meanings, as well as its beauty, lament, and hope.</description>

   <title>The Evolution of American Evangelicalism (April 12, 2007)</title>
   <description>Last month, conservative Christian leaders demanded that Richard Cizik be silenced or removed from his post. They charged that his concerns about climate change and torture have shifted attention away from moral issues such as gay marriage and abortion. But for Cizik, poverty, war, and the environment are moral issues too. We revisit Krista&apos;s 2006 conversation with Cizik that took many listeners by surprise.</description>

   <title>Sacred Wilderness, An African Story (February 22, 2007)</title>
   <description>Isabel Mukonyora has followed and studied a religious movement of her Shona people, the Masowe Apostles, that embraces Christian tradition while addressing the drama of African life and history. The founder of this movement, Johane Masowe, emphasized an ancient Jewish and Christian pull to the wilderness. Through her stories we explore modern African spirituality, diaspora, and finding meaning, as Mukonyora says, &quot;in the margins.&quot;</description>

   <title>Children of Abraham (February 8, 2007)</title>
   <description>Abraham is the common patriarch of Judaism, Islam, and Christianity. His story spans dramatic territory of the modern world — both physical and spiritual — beginning in southern Iraq and ending in the West Bank city of Hebron. Journalist Bruce Feiler went in search of Abraham to understand the crises and possibilities of the 21st-century world. The story of Abraham, Feiler says, illuminates God and politics, sacred geography, and modern spirituality.</description>

   <title>Whale Songs and Elephant Loves (February 1, 2007)</title>
   <description>Katy Payne is an acoustic biologist with a Quaker sensibility. In a career that has spanned the wild coast of Argentina and the rainforests of Africa, she discovered that humpback whales compose ever-changing songs; and that elephants communicate across long distances by way of sounds beyond the realm of human hearing. She reflects on life in this world through listening to two of its largest and most mysterious creatures.</description>

   <title>Diplomacy and Religion in the 21st Century (January 25, 2007)</title>
   <description>The greatest threat in the post-Cold War world, says Douglas Johnston, is the prospective marriage of religious extremism with weapons of mass destruction. Yet the U.S. spends most of its time, resources, and weapons fighting the symptoms of this threat, not the cause. The diplomacy of the future, he is showing, must engage religion as part of the strategic solution to global conflicts.</description>

   <title>Discovering Where We Live: Reimagining Environmentalism (January 11, 2007)</title>
   <description>Environmentalism and climate change are hot topics; yet they&apos;re still often imagined as the territory of scientists, expert activists, and those who can afford to be environmentally conscious. We discover two people who are transforming the ecology of their immediate worlds — Majora Carter, a secular urban strategist unraveling ties between ecology and injustice as she strives for balance and beauty in the South Bronx; and Calvin DeWitt, a scientist and evangelical Christian who&apos;s been pioneering sustainability in the rural Midwest for three decades.</description>

   <description>Robi Damelin lost her son David to a Palestinian sniper. Ali Abu Awwad lost his older brother Yousef to an Israeli soldier. But, instead of clinging to traditional ideologies and turning their pain into more violence, they&apos;ve decided to understand the other side — Israeli and Palestinian — by sharing their pain and their humanity. They tell of a gathering network of survivors who share their grief, their stories of loved ones, and their ideas for lasting peace.

   <title>The Soul in Depression (November 16, 2006)</title>
   <description>Nearly ten million Americans are diagnosed with clinical depression. And, as we have become more conversant about the disease, a body of literature has appeared by people who have struggled with depression and found it to be a lesson in the nature of the human soul. Krista engages some of these voices: author Andrew Solomon, poet and psychologist Anita Barrows, and Quaker educator Parker Palmer.</description>

And, Krista Tippett speaks with Seyyed Hossein Nasr, an esteemed Muslim scholar who brings a broad religious and historical perspective to hard questions about Islam and the West that have lingered uncomfortably in American life since 9/11.</description>

   <title>The Freelance Monotheism of Karen Armstrong (August 17, 2006)</title>
   <description>Karen Armstrong speaks about her progression from a disillusioned and damaged young nun into, in her words, a &quot;freelance monotheist.&quot; She&apos;s a formidable thinker and scholar, but as a theologian she calls herself an amateur -- noting that the Latin root of the word &quot;amateur&quot; means a love of one&apos;s subject. Seven years in a strict religious order nearly snuffed out her ability to think about faith at all. Here, we hear the story behind Armstrong&apos;s developing ideas about God.</description>

   <title>Gay Marriage: Broken or Blessed? Two Evangelical Views (August 3, 2006)</title>
   <description>Our culture&apos;s acrimonious debate on the morality of gay marriage has been framed in religious — largely conservative Christian — terms. With Richard Mouw and Virginia Ramey Mollenkott, we go behind the rhetoric to explore the human confusion, hopes, and fears this subject arouses. We&apos;ll name hard questions that these religious people on both sides of the issue are asking themselves, and that they would like to ask of others.</description>

   <itunes:subtitle>Evangelical voices on both sides of the gay marriage debate</itunes:subtitle>
   <itunes:summary>Our culture&apos;s acrimonious debate on the morality of gay marriage has been framed in religious — largely conservative Christian — terms. With Richard Mouw and Virginia Ramey Mollenkott, we go behind the rhetoric to explore the human confusion, hopes, and fears this subject arouses. We&apos;ll name hard questions that these religious people on both sides of the issue are asking themselves, and that they would like to ask of others.</itunes:summary>

   <title>Heart and Soul: The Integrative Medicine of Dr. Mehmet Oz (June 22, 2006)</title>

It has stressed medical treatment of biological ailments. Cardiovascular surgeon Mehmet Oz speaks about the intersection of Western medicine, human spirituality, and the physiology of the human heart.</description>

   <title>The Spirituality of Parenting (June 15, 2006)</title>
   <description>How do parents and grandparents nurture the spiritual and moral awareness of the children in our lives? Rabbi Sandy Sasso has written books that help children and adults of many backgrounds discuss religion and ethics together. The spiritual life, she says, begins not in abstractions, but in concrete everyday experiences. And children need our questions as much as our answers.</description>

   <title>A History of Doubt (June 8, 2006)</title>
   <description>Our guest, poet and historian Jennifer Michael Hecht, says that as a scholar she always noticed the &quot;shadow history&quot; of doubt out of the corner of her eye. She shows how non-belief, skepticism, and doubt have paralleled and at times shaped the world&apos;s great religious and secular belief systems. She suggests that only in modern time has doubt been narrowly equated with a complete rejection of faith, or a broader sense of mystery.</description>

   <title>The Need for Creeds (May 18, 2006)</title>
   <description>For many modern Americans, the very idea of reciting an unchanging creed, composed centuries ago, is troublesome. But, Jaroslav Pelikan, a scholar who has devoted his life to exploring the vitality of ancient theology and creeds, insists that even modern pluralists need strong statements of belief. Here, we revisit Krista&apos;s 2003 conversation with him, who, then, in his 80th year, had released a historic collection of Christian faith from biblical times to the present and from across the globe. They discuss the history and nature of creeds, and how a fixed creed can be reconciled with an honest, intellectual faith that changes and evolves.</description>

We learn how scientist and theologian John Polkinghorne applies the deepest insights of modern physics to think about how the world fundamentally works, and how the universe might make space for prayer.</description>

   <title>Exodus, Cargo of Hidden Stories (April 13, 2006)</title>
   <description>Avivah Zornberg is one of the great, creative interpreters of Talmud and Torah in the  ontemporary world. She guides us through the Exodus story that is commemorated during the eight days of Passover. Passover is also the backdrop of the Easter events of the Christian New Testament. We find meaning in the text that Cecil B. DeMille and Disney never imagined — about the worst and the best of human nature, and the realities and ironies of human freedom.</description>
