<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">Diverse Arts Collective helps woman turn job loss<br />
Into an opportunity to follow her dreams</span></h2>
<p>&#8220;Married in the Nick of Nine,&#8221; a newly released novel published by Diverse Arts Collective, officially launches on June 9, 2012. The company is excited about the book about a woman who wants to meet, fall in love with, and marry &#8220;The One&#8221; within nine months. But what&#8217;s equally interesting is the novel&#8217;s inception.</p>
<p>Not too long ago, Alretha Thomas was a secretary at an investment bank. On a Tuesday afternoon, her personnel manager asked to see her right away. “My stomach did a million flips. I whispered a prayer and headed to the conference room like a woman on death row,” Alretha said. Her fears were well-founded: After twelve years with the same firm, she was let go.</p>
<p>Alretha packed her belongings and called her husband with the bad news: She had joined the ranks of the unemployed. But according to Alretha, she had an ace in the hole, and that was her faith. When she prayed for guidance, it dawned on her she was now free to write. A graduate of USC with a degree in journalism, Alretha had always fantasized about a full-time writing career. In fact, she’d gotten an idea for a book earlier that year about a woman who wanted to meet, fall in love with, and marry “The One” before her thirtieth birthday. “I didn’t really believe anything would happen with ‘Married in the Nick of Nine.’ I had two-self-published novels and I didn’t want to self-publish a third. At the time, I had no hopes of getting a deal. I only had about thirty pages written.”</p>
<p>On a Friday, three days after being laid off, Alretha decided to do a test query. “I never expected to get a bite, especially not from my first query. But lo and behold, the agent responded immediately. I was shocked.” When the agent asked to read the entire manuscript, Alretha was filled with a mixture of glee and dread. “I thought about how long it would take me to finish the manuscript and worried that, by the time I was done, the agent would no longer be interested. So I got busy. My husband thought I was crazy.” For the next three days, from four o’clock in the morning until one the next morning, Alretha wrote nonstop. On the following Monday, she received another email from the agent asking if the manuscript had gotten lost in cyberspace. “I couldn’t believe it. By now I was close to finished. I had nearly seventy-thousand words; the book had practically written itself. I felt like Bradley Cooper in the movie “Limitless,” but instead of the fictional drug NZT, I was using faith and prayer to complete what I thought was an impossible task. I emailed the manuscript on Tuesday, September 27, 2011— four days after I started writing the novel and one week after I was laid off!”</p>
<p>Alretha received great feedback from the agent, but did not receive a deal. Encouraged, she began querying other agents and receiving more requests for the manuscript. However, after several passes, she decided it was time to let someone other than an agent read her work. So she reached out to Renni Browne at “The Editorial Department.” “I was told that my concept was great and my writing solid, but ‘Married in the Nick of Nine’ needed more work to get to the next level.” Alretha took in the feedback she received from Jesse Steele, an editor assigned to her novel and diligently worked on her book. After being laid off for four months, Alretha’s manuscript was ready for resubmission.</p>
<p>Alretha resubmitted her novel, and received positive reviews about her writing and the concept, but was told countless times by agents, that because of the sluggish economy and her status as a first-time author, they would be hardpressed to sell her book. Determined to introduce her story to the world, after several months, Alretha decided to self-publish through Diverse Arts Collective.</p>
<p>“Married in the Nick of Nine” is now available on Amazon.com. For more information regarding Alretha and or her novel, please go to <a href="http://www.marriedinthenickofnine.com/">http://www.Marriedinthenickofnine.com</a>.</p>

<p>Alretha is the author of several critically acclaimed and award winning plays, including the hit play One Woman, Two Lives. <a href="http://marriedinthenickofnine.com/">Married in the Nick of Nine</a> is her third novel. Her novels Daughter Denied and Dancing Her Dreams Away, praised by readers and book clubs across the country, debuted in 2008 and 2011, respectively.</p>
<p>===================================================</p>
<p>Cassandra Whitmore is facing yet another Valentine’s Day alone. Her love life is as dry as the Sharpie pen she uses to mark an even more dreadful day on her calendar—her upcoming 30th birthday. Driven by the maddening ticking of her biological clock, Cassandra is determined to meet, fall in love with, and marry “The One” within nine months. When Cassandra accompanies her cousin to a night club, her Type-A quest to meet a man is quickly rewarded by a stranger’s velvety, baritone voice asking if he might occupy the seat next to her. He’s Nicolas Harte, whose good looks leave Cassandra speechless, but not for long. After mustering enough courage to strike up a conversation, she learns Nicolas is everything she wants in a man—smart, successful, and available. There’s only one catch: He’s “GU” (geographically undesirable). Nonetheless, Cassandra falls in love with Nicolas and makes the uncharacteristic decision to move from Los Angeles to New York to be with him. But Cassandra gets a rude awakening when she discovers there’s something rotten in the Big Apple.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-14086 aligncenter" title="Celeste Johnson - KO Tax &amp; Financial Services ~ People You Need to Know Magazine" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Celeste-Johnson-KO-Tax-Financial-Services-People-You-Need-to-Know-Magazine.jpg" alt="Celeste Johnson KO Tax Financial Services People You Need to Know Magazine Power Spotlight: Celeste O. Johnson ~ KO Tax & Financial Services" width="610" height="553" /></p>
<p><strong>When I moved to Atlanta 28 years ago,</strong> little did I know that I would work 13 years with the #1 leader in the tax industry as Office Manager, PR Coordinator and Instructor for basic and advanced tax courses. As a result of my leadership, I was instrumental in developing innovative approaches resulting in improved compliance, increased tax revenues ($100K+) and outstanding customer service.</p>
<p><strong>In 1991, I was forced to re-evaluate my life and career</strong> when I was terminated from the job I enjoyed most. When I attempted to sue for wrongful termination, I was advised that I had no recourse of action because Georgia was an at will state. As a result, I vowed that no one would ever have that type of control over my livelihood and as a result, I became self-employed, started a wholesale travel company and later ventured into the tax industry.</p>
<p><strong>KO Tax and Financial Services offer</strong> tax preparation, tax courses and accounting services. Although we have the ability to serve anyone, our ideal clients are small business owners and homeowners. I love working with start-up businesses because it gives me the opportunity to set them on the right track and teach them financial responsibility without having to correct mistakes while they are still in the blueprint phase of their business. The best advice I can offer is to file and pay your taxes upfront and set realistic goals about your refund. Most importantly, I have the awesome opportunity to sow financial seeds into promising businesses or connect them to reliable services that will assist them in reaching their next level of success.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.kotaxandfinancialservices.com"><img class="size-full wp-image-12508 aligncenter" title="KO Tax &amp; Financial Services" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/KO-Tax-Financial-Services.jpg" alt="KO Tax Financial Services Power Spotlight: Celeste O. Johnson ~ KO Tax & Financial Services" width="610" height="220" /></a></p>
<p><strong>I guess that’s why my clients consistently</strong> express that I have a positive influence on their financial decisions making them feel relaxed and confident. It is customer feedback like this that drives us to continue our focused success of 1) Preparing tax returns with accuracy, patience and advice in an effort to ensure the client will not be contacted by the IRS about infraction on their taxes, 2) Increasing our year-to-year referrals from loyal customers and 3) Over-delivering in the service we provide whether it be tax or personal savings advice.</p>
<p><strong>Looking from the outside in, </strong>one would think that I attribute my success to having a thriving business, but my true success is being in a position to provide for my 2 daughters in college, as well as, overcoming cancer. I also attribute my success to maintaining a balanced life by taking interest in my <em>bowling League, reading, movie watching, going to the beach, travelling and visiting the Casino.</em></p>
<p><strong>No one would have ever been able to tell me that my perceived setbacks</strong> in life were setups for the life that I now enjoy today. As long as I keep God and my mantras of guidance before me, I can continue this journey of peace, freedom and being of true service to others.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mantras</span></strong></p>
<p><em>Look at life as a cycle you go through. Everything has a season.  Live, love and learn as much as you can and then release.</em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>I <em>shall pass this way but once. Therefore, any good that I can do or any kindness that I can show let me do it now, for I shall not pass this way again.</em></p>

<p>In 2010, actress and philanthropist Meagan Good (currently starring in the #1 movie <em>Think Like A Man</em>) partnered with long time friend Super Producer Kevin &#8220;Khao&#8221; Cates (TI, Jay-Z, R. Kelly, Ludacris) in his non-profit 501 (c) (3) organization <strong>Bridge DA </strong>(Developing Academics) <strong>Gap</strong>™. <em>Bridge</em> was formed in 2008 after Khao says he had an intense desire to &#8220;Be significant rather than just being successful.&#8221; At the peak of his multi-platinum music career, stepping out on faith, Khao walked out of the studio and took a year and a half off of music to write the <strong>Bridge DA Gap</strong> textbook. In the process, he spent nearly one million dollars in two years bringing his vision into reality.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge DA Gap</strong> is a text/workbook (written by Khao), CD and DVD curriculum that focus on mentoring and building character in our youth. There are twelve chapters in the book that include such subjects as Self-Esteem, Bullying, Gang Violence, Patience, Self-Determination and much more. Every chapter begins with an overview and ends with solutions. Each song on the CD corresponds with a chapter in the <strong>Bridge DA Gap</strong> textbook and were all produced by Khao.</p>
<p>Impressed with her friend’s tenacity, Meagan quickly became involved. First by becoming the spokeswoman as well as teaching the curriculum with Khao via the DVD component (that fits seamlessly into any teachers’ lesson plan), then by becoming a <strong>Bridge DA Gap</strong> board member.</p>
<p>Already in select schools and programs throughout the US, 2012 will be a landmark year for the <strong>Bridge DA Gap</strong> and the collaborative partnership with Meagan Good whose goal is to further expand the <em>Bridge</em> curriculum throughout as many communities as possible.</p>
<p>Even with her hectic schedule with the success of <em>Think Like A Man</em>, Megan still finds time to Bridge DA Gap. Not one to focus on the problems with our youth, Mr. Cates instead has developed a plan where “the solution is with Bridge DA Gap.”</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;">How to Add Vocal Impact as a Business Woman</span></h2>
<p>Women tend not to brag about their accomplishments, whether they are executive leaders in charge of large corporations, or businesswomen starting out. Training your voice skills will add impact to your presence, build confidence, realize goals, and boost recognition. There are three key vocal elements that businesswomen need to complete as part of their professional development package: voice projection, appropriate pitch level, and emphatic delivery.</p>
<p>How often have you been told that you have a quiet or a soft tone, which may be very pleasing; but, it may also convey a weakness of your business wisdom or power? Have you tried to speak louder only to end up with a sore throat or rising pitch and stress levels? Professional training in voice projection can make a difference to your presence. When you need to be heard at the back of the room or simply draw attention to the importance of your message, voice projection tools are your best friend.</p>
<p>Projecting the voice properly using diaphragmatic breathing techniques, similar to how actors train, will allow you to possess all the nuances and dynamism that you want to convey, without shouting or having a sore throat. The essence of projection is that you are using more air to support your speech, and can direct or aim your vocal sound farther away. With practice and focus, you can easily control the projected volume to meet any situation. A bonus factor is that this control will provide a &#8220;Plan B&#8221; to stop or manage any nervousness while speaking. Learning to use your breath is the foundation to your image and presence.</p>
<p>The second key element is controlling your vocal pitch level to exude confidence and attract listeners. Your pitch level will rise when your muscles, particularly around your throat and shoulders are tense. A nasal pitch caused by too much resonance in the nasal chamber can be an annoying sound for most listeners. The reaction you want is for your listener to follow through with your speech message; you do not want them to rush out of the room because of an irritating nasal sound. Again, through vocal exercises, you can discover your individual optimal pitch level, correct any speech distortions, and learn how to present a pleasing but persuasive voice.</p>
<p>Finally, women business entrepreneurs need to be aware of using their voice as a means to connect their story to convince a customer of its value. Negotiation of contracts, advocacy for non-profits, or sale of products occur because of your efficient voice power practice. This is a skill that can easily be learned by rehearsing and speaking a variety of literary and business materials. You learn to apply voice techniques working with these pieces to produce emphasis at critical points. This method includes developing pauses and changing pace with appropriate inflection to entice the listener to be attentive, involved, and moved by your speech.</p>
<p>For the business mom or the executive woman, knowing how to use your voice effectively will add recognition to yourself, and help you achieve a speech delivered with impact.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #993300;">1. You have a mission to accomplish!</span></h2>
<p>You are not here on earth merely to exist. You have a purpose, something special to offer the world and people are waiting for you to manifest this gift and bless their lives. The importance and urgency of your dream, calling, idea or goal prompts you to take action. Tomorrow is promised to no one, but you have your life right now. You must get your life back because you can&#8217;t quit and you can&#8217;t surrender &#8212; you are a woman on a mission!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;">2. Surprise! You already have the resources you need!</span></h2>
<p>What is it that you have in your hand? What experiences have you gone through? Who have you met? What lessons have you learned? What burns in your heart? Wow! You are already qualified, trained, talented or experienced in some specific area. You have gone through so much and sacrificed too much to continue on an unfulfilling life path because of &#8220;feelings.&#8221; You probably know that time doesn&#8217;t stand still in the hope that you will be in the right mood or frame of mind to act. The longer you wait, the slimmer your chances of action become. You deserve to feel good about your present and past accomplishments and what you can still do. Stand up and be counted today!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;">3. You are alive, energetic, creative, resourceful, strong, able and willing.</span></h2>
<p>There may never be another moment like this moment. The perfect time is when you are motivated, full of energy and in good health. If you can see, hear, think, read, talk, or walk &#8212;you are alive! You have every right in the world to feel good about your life! This is the time for you to churn creative and fresh ideas, turning them into reality. Get excited about something and &#8220;strike while the iron is hot!&#8221; Live your life fully now!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;">4. Opportunities are everywhere &#8212; waiting to be seized by you.</span></h2>
<p>There are so many opportunities, waiting to be seized by someone who will take the risk and do what is required. That someone is you! There is no time left to bemoan your life &#8230; this is your moment. Today is the time to move to the next level. Make that phone call, start that business, sign up for that class, forgive that person, help the needy, pursue that goal, pay off that debt, invest in that venture, go on that adventure, love again &#8212; believe again! A new phase has begun. Embrace it and move forward with confidence!</p>
<h2><span style="color: #993300;">5. You can choose to do better for yourself today.</span></h2>
<p>If you choose to put in the work required, you can earn more money, eat healthy, gain respect, reduce your stress, increase your happiness, find a good relationship, stop tolerating stuff that doesn&#8217;t work and so forth. Your foremost responsibility is to yourself. Give yourself a chance to attain your goals. Make the right choices and decisions, put your best foot forward and do everything necessary to ensure that you achieve success. What are you choosing today?</p>
<p>You can feel good again &#8230; yes, it&#8217;s possible! But first, you must get motivated toward a worthwhile goal &#8230; your life!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Daniel-Caldwell-Named-President-CEO-of-1st-Choice-Credit-Union2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13939" title="Daniel Caldwell - The Pride of 1st Choice Credit Union" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Daniel-Caldwell-Named-President-CEO-of-1st-Choice-Credit-Union2.jpg" alt="Daniel Caldwell Named President CEO of 1st Choice Credit Union2 The Pride of 1st Choice Credit Union: President/CEO Daniel Caldwell" width="596" height="653" /></a>Pride is one of those qualities that can go either way in a person. Someone with pride can be boastful and self-inflating, only caring about who they are. Or they can be strong and selfless, focusing on what they can do and who they can help.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see that the President/CEO of <a href="http://www.1stchoicecu.org/">1st Choice Credit Union</a>, Daniel Caldwell, has the right kind of pride. He’s proud of the work he does in a financial institution, working to fill the needs of people who are under-served in the banking industry. He’s proud of the <em>community</em> he serves. And he’s <em>proud</em> that his position allows him to <em>help</em> those who would otherwise struggle to financially succeed.</p>
<p>Sure, the CEO at a big bank might be proud of his work too. He may be proud of inflating fees and increasing the quarterly profit. He might be proud of serving a select and elite clientele. But there’s clearly a difference between that man, and Mr. Caldwell, who is passionate about giving people a chance.</p>
<p>1<sup>st </sup>Choice Credit Union offers all of the same products as banks. They also have many other in-house financial programs that make it possible for people to buy homes and vehicles &#8212; who would otherwise have slipped through the cracks at a large banking organization.</p>
<p>Daniel Caldwell’s proudest moment as Interim CEO, was being able to help someone get approved to buy a vehicle. After the member was turned down for financing at other organizations, Mr. Caldwell was able to say “YES” and get the keys into this member’s hands. How many banking CEOs could say that their proudest moment was measured by the look on someone&#8217;s face?</p>
<p>Daniel Caldwell’s pride also shines through in the <em>programs</em> that the credit union offers, and in the way members are treated at 1st Choice by his great staff.  Caldwell is proud that he has a Board of Directors and a staff who are all committed to serving the needs of the membership – and what is best for them is <em>always</em> the driving force when making decisions.</p>
<p>1<sup>st </sup>Choice Credit Union doesn’t just hold your money and finance loans; their programs are designed to help members gain financial stability, repair credit, and achieve goals. Caldwell notes that being turned down for financing isn’t the end of the line. 1<sup>st</sup> Choice Credit Union offers financial literacy education to help you take the steps to get approved in the future. They also offer a first-time home buyer’s workshop, where members can learn if they qualify for grants to help them buy their first home.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a financial institution that cares, call Atlanta’s <a href="http://www.1stchoicecu.org/">1st Choice Credit Union</a>, and experience the <em>pride </em>for yourself. (404) 832-5800</p>
