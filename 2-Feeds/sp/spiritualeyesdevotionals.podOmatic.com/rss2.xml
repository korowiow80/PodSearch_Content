      <title>Hearing God's Voice</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1125352/600x600_1475879.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever wondered if God can be heard? Are you going through a situation where you&#8217;re seeking to find out if the little voice you&#8217;ve been hearing is that of God, your flesh, or the voice of Satan? God does speak to us and we can hear His voice. But, we must be cautious that what we hear is indeed God's voice. Join me as we explore passages in the books of John, I John, II Timothy, Hebrews, I Thessalonians, Proverbs, Colossians, and Psalms to help us in how we determine the true and profound voice of God. </description>

      <title>Trust In The Lord</title>

Friends will come and go...family will support and oppose. But, the Lord will neither abandon us nor forsake us...and it is with Him we should place our trust. Join me as we explore passages in the books of Proverbs, Psalm, and Isaiah to help us understand the importance of trusting in the Lord.</description>

The best example of chivalry in the Bible is Jesus, who not only treated everyone He met with respect, but also put our needs above His own to be our Lord and Savior. Good character alone makes any man worthy of love. Simple acts of chivalry and courtesy shows respect. Men who practice this respectful behavior are much more engaging and appealing as potential mates. Old-fashioned etiquette will go a long way when winning over the heart of a lady.

      <title>Love Covers Sins</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1125352/600x600_846753.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love covers sins! It fuels relationships in a good way.. When we forgive, we don't keep score of offenses against us. Some people have vivid memories of past sins of others, but a vague memory for remembering their own sins. When Jesus died on the cross for our sins, he cried out, &quot;It is finished!&quot; When you say you forgive, remember Jesus' words on the cross. Let that be the end of it. Join me as we explore passages in the books of Proverbs, First Peter, and James in helping us learn how love covers sins.
