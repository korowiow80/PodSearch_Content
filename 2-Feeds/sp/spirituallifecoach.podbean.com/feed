<p>In this healing podcast, we are going to create the vibration in the key of C while chanting MAAAAAA  AUUUUUUUUUR. You can listen in at first and feel the sound vibration healing go through your entire body. Then listen once again, only this time chant with me and create the vibration within your own body for healing and atunement to the god within you.</p>
<p>You will notice that when you close your mouth over, just a little bit, to form the sound AU with a slight R sound at the end, the atonement brings you into the oneness with me and all creation.This will assist and heal you in so many ways from simply stress healing to raising your frequency and awakening to the god within.</p>
<p>This podcast is a track from my Guided Meditation CD &#8216;<a href="http://www.messagefromthegoddess.com/find-your-self-guided-meditation-mp3-album-cd">Find Your Self</a>&#8216;. Enjoy. <img src="http://www.podbean.com/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
