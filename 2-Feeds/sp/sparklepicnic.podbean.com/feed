			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is actually the 19<sup>th</sup> episode of &#8216;wtfiasp?&#8217;, despite what I say in the opening. I recorded this about six months ago and then sat on it for two reasons. Number one, it felt incomplete. It ends abruptly because we run out of battery AND tape. Number two, what was recorded was ended up being things I didn’t think would be smart to say on a podcast. However, nobody listens to this, so I&#8217;m not as horrified (except the people who do, usually end up being co-workers&#8230;). So tune in and hear Adam and I talk about brothers with substance problems, weird situations, and drugs. Lots of drugs.</p>
