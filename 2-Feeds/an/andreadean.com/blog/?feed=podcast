In this podcast I interview Tom Baldwin. Tom and his wife Shannon Casey own Uluwehi Farm, a permaculture farm in North Kohala on the Big Island. Tom talks about what permaculture is and how it helps farms and homesteads to be more productive. Tom just got back from a trip to Australia where he sat at the feet of the permaculture master- <a href="http://www.tagari.com/">Bill Mollison</a>, the founder of the permaculture system. Tom will be sharing that new knowledge and his permaculture farm experience in January when he is co-teaching a <a href="http://www.uluwehifarm.com/PermacultureCourse2010.html">Permaculture Design Certification course </a>with Craig Elevitch and Nik Bertulis, the course starts Jan 5th.<br />

In this podcast I interview Tyler Mongan, Founder and Publisher of the <a href="http://www.honuguide.com/">Honu Guide</a>- a guide for sustainable living in Hawaii. The <a href="http://www.honuguide.com">Honu Guide</a> is a resource book that is published once a year. The <a href="http://www.honuguide.com">Honu Guide</a> features well written articles on sustainability issues in Hawaii, and has a coupon book and resource directory that links people to green goods, services and organizations. Their distribution model is also innovative- organizations can sell the guide as a fundraiser for their organization. Schools take note- the Honu Guide is much healthier than a Krispy Kreme doughnut fundraiser! As a green business owner and writer- I think the Honu Guide is a great way to get the word out about my work.<br />

In this podcast I interview Guy Kaulukukui, Director of the <a href="http://www.kohalacenter.org/index.html">Kohala Center’s</a> Food Self-Reliance Program.<br />
<br/><br />
<div id="attachment_338" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 288px"><a href="http://www.andreadean.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/guy-kaulukukui-kohala-center-food-self-reliance.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-338" title="guy-kaulukukui-kohala-center-food-self-reliance" src="http://www.andreadean.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/guy-kaulukukui-kohala-center-food-self-reliance.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="235" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Guy Kaulukukui speaking at the North Kohala Food Forum</p></div><br />
Guy has been tasked with developing a &#8220;critical path&#8221; to food self-reliance for Hawaii Island- mapping a strategy for how the island will decrease food imports and the increase consumption of local food. Guy Kaulukukui, who has a Ph.D. in economics education is uniquely suited to this complex task of how to transition from a import economy to a locally-based economy.  Guy feels that it is important to increase the demand side of the food equation by reinforcing the message of eating locally produced food as well as working on increasing efficiency on farms to decrease the costs of local produce to the public.<br />

In this podcast I interview Zach Mermel about the <a href="http://transitionhawaii.ning.com/">Transition Town Movement in Hawaii.</a> The Transition Town Movement came out of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">Permaculture</a> Community. <a href="http://transitionculture.org/about/">Rob Hopkins</a> was teaching permaculture in Kinsale, Ireland and he challenged his students to think about a future that was post peak oil by creating an energy descent action plan. This document was the origin of what has now become the Transition Towns movement.  As Rob Hopkins writes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transition-Handbook-Dependency-Resilience-Guides/dp/1900322188"><em>The Transition Handbook: From Oil Dependency to Local Resilience</em></a>, “It is one thing to campaign against climate change and quite another to paint a compelling and engaging vision of a post-carbon world in such a way as to enthuse others to embark on a journey towards it.”<br />
<br/><br />
There are no official Transition Town communities here in Hawaii <em>yet</em>, but there are discussions afoot and communities who are beginning to discuss how to become transition towns. There is an online social network <a href="http://transitionhawaii.ning.com/">http://transitionhawaii.ning.com</a>/ where you can join the Hawaii conversation and learn more about the Transition Town movement. Zach Mermel started the social networking site <a href="http://transitionhawaii.ning.com/">transitionhawaii.ning.com</a> and has gone through the Transition Town training.<br />
