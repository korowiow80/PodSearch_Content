								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ PERFECT WORLDRecording Artist, Composer and Renaissance Woman SEAY talks about her muse and inspiration in creating her music. ABOUT SEAY“As rare and unique as an identical snowflake and more haunting than a scream in space”, “Evocative and extraordinary”, are but some of the descriptions that make up the remarkable sound of Seay (pronounced ‘say'). Originating Evocative Vocals, Lush orchestration, and intricate compositions, the beauty of Seay's spectacular one of a kind voice and music will dazzle your senses. “1 Voice”, Seay's extrordinary debut, under her label Tuscan Sun, hit the airwaves, spending almost a year on the charts and was followed by a Best New Age Song nomination for “Love Is The Ocean”.  Selections of her music are a regular addition on the syndicated program “Soundscapes” from Music Choice, Sirius XM SPA and many others. One of the highlights of her career has been being apart of XM's surround sound launch. Her music can be heard alongside Elvis Costello, Steely Dan, Enya, Sting, Norah Jones, Ray Charles and more.  'A Winter Blessing', continues the gorgeous and emotive fusion of music that is drawing listeners from across the globe. A Holiday Top 5 and Life Style Music Awards Nominee for Best Seasonal Album, &quot;A Winter Blessing&quot; is a gorgeous listening experience featuring Seay's spectacular voice alongside several renowned instrumentalists. Stay tuned!    ]]></itunes:summary>
