For some reason skype has been having issues and we wont be able to release a podcast this week. We got halfway through an episode when we realized the audio was spiking and dragging so of course that got canned. We tried several more attempts and we couldn't get rid of it and there was no way that I know of to fix it through editing. Hopefull over the next 4 or 5 days we can figure out whats wrong or I guess it's back to eyecreate with the ps3 eye (shudders)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/3731366726457962998-2582868298505274379?l=angrymanontheside.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/AngryManOnTheSidePodcast/~4/tF2JO05pfjU" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description><app:edited xmlns:app="http://www.w3.org/2007/app">2010-03-10T15:42:27.705-08:00</app:edited><thr:total xmlns:thr="http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0">0</thr:total><feedburner:origLink>http://angrymanontheside.blogspot.com/2010/03/skype-issues-grrrr.html</feedburner:origLink></item><item><title>Episode 23</title><link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/AngryManOnTheSidePodcast/~3/FboDLSB4IHk/episode-23.html</link><author>angrymanontheside@gmail.com (Icomeinpeace)</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2010 02:22:01 PST</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3731366726457962998.post-2562459317795708069</guid><description>Sup everyone, sadly this is an episode without the aide of Allenshok but he will be through moving and have his service hooked up shortly. This time around it really is just me so I start out by going over what I've been playing and my impressions of Heavy Rain. After that I do some news including the content included in the dlc for Borderlands, Bioshock 2 &amp; Heavy Rain.

This episode we listened to a few of you and put everything into a format. We started off with what we've been playing then touched on how I feel about Batman: Arkham Asylum and it's recent comparisons to Infamous. After that, we hit the news, some titles that Sony will show at TGS and some upcoming releases (MAG &amp;amp; Uncharted 2) and how we feel about all the different bonuses that are starting to accompany a single game depending on where you preorder it from. Lastly we talked about the upcoming Infinite Bits Convention that will be held in Miami Oct. 23rd - Oct. 25th.
