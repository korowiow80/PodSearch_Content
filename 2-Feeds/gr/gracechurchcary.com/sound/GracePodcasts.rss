Peter and John are described as "ordinary," which in Greek means "an ignoramus, an ignorant or unlearned person, an idiot."  This isn't describing them as an idiot like we think of an idiot today, but rather an idiot who simply believed that Jesus was who He said He was and that He did what He said He would do.  By the world's standards, they were idiots.  But regardless of how the world labels Christians, that is what God wants us to do - leave the world behind and be fully devoted to following Christ.

Those who explode on the spot, and those who push the anger deep inside and usually explode over something else later on.  In Matthew, Jesus tells us that we sin regardless of whether we commit the act outwardly or only in our hearts.  So even though someone who holds their anger in may think they are being obedient to Christ, they really are just sinning in their heart, just as someone who explodes is sinning outwardly.  We need to learn to deal with anger by spending time with God.  We need to ask ourselves, "Why am I angry?" and "Who can help me?"  Without taking these steps to get control of our anger, we can never fully be the person Christ wants us to be and achieve all that He wants us to achieve.

It is only love that can transform a sinful, selfish, and self-centered person.  Love doesn't seek its own good, but rather the good of others.  Love doesn't puff up itself.  It builds up others.

We want people to love us and welcome us for who we are and the way we are.  We know we aren't perfect and that we won't always agree.  Still we search for a place to "hang our hat."  We look for a place where we are accepted.  Acceptance is the patent expression of unconditional and sacrificial love, but acceptance is not an attachment to a behavior, it is an attachment to a person.  Acceptance is not, however, an approval of bad behavior.  We accept a person, but we may not approve of his choices, lifestyle, or behavior.  For the person being accepted, and loved, the fear of rejection is removed.  This is how Christ loves us, and because of this perfect love, God accepts us into His family, despite our behavior and sins.

Just take a quick look at the news to see all the rich, famous, and powerful people who are not content - wanting more money, more fame, more possessions, and more power.  We think that if we had some of the things that these rich and famouse people have, we'd be content; however, contentment has nothing to do with our circumstances.  Paul recognized this and wrote "I can do everything through Him Who gives me strength."  Until we realize that satisfaction is only found through Christ, we will never be completely content.

He told us about these things so that we could experience and have these 3 things in our life.  1. Peace: We live in a crazy world.  Jesus wants us to have peace.  A crazy world isn't conducive to peace.  Real peace is found in Jesus.  He has overcome the world.  2. Assurance: We live in a chaotic world.  Jesus wants us to have assurance.  In the midst or chaos, God still rules and reigns.  Real assurance comes through Jesus.  Our Father in heaven is watching over us.  3. Hope: We live in world that is coming apart - busting at the seams.  Jesus wants us to have hope.  Things may look dark and grim.  A brighter day is coming.  Real hope is grounded in Jesus.  There’s more to life than here and now.  He has overcome death, hell, and the grave.

We can really hurt others when our words are like arrows, piercing their soul with malice and spite.  Our words are really a reflection of what is in our hearts.  In Matthew, we're told that we will have to give an account "for every careless word."  Examine your speech - your interaction with the people in your life.  This will give you an indication of what is in your heart.  Then, allow God's Word to convict you and transform your heart.  As you change, you'll see how your words can then bring life and healing to others.

Pride is toxic to us because it means that we exalt ourselves above everyone else.  Pride sets us against one another.  Pride also sets us against God, because we are exalting ourselves above Him.  God hates pride.  Jesus humbled Himself and became obedient to death, even death on a cross.  As a result, God exalted Him to the highest place.
