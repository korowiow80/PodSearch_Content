        <itunes:summary>	John DeFries has dedicated most of his professional years to promoting the islands of Hawaii.  For the past 28 years, he has been directly involved with the State’s visitor industry.  Today, John sits as president and CEO of Hokuli’a Development, a 1550-acre master plan community on the Big Island.
	John owes his career inclination to the exposure that he has had with various cultures, which has also made him realize the value of his own customs and traditions.
	 “Engaging with people who come from different places in the world is probably an education that I value greatly even to this day,” he said. 
	John’s mother, who took care of him and his siblings as they grew up, continues to be his inspiration. But what made a profound impact in his outlook is the passing of his father when he was 28 years old.

“I realized that there needed to be seriousness about my future,” John said.  “It’s very easy for me to maintain a carefree attitude because I don’t have roots to speak of even within my own hometown.”  
	“But the loss of my father had a profound impact to the responsibility I had,” he added.  Along with the help he has received from mentors, John struggled though the rough path to success with determination.  
	“Along the way, several mentors, typically higher executives in the company took the time, took the patience, saw some potential and invested their time, energy and expertise in grooming me,” John said.  “I am extremely grateful for that.  I find myself reaching out in the same way to others that I meet.”
	John is well known for his work in bringing cultures, communities and business together.  He is member of the board of a number of community organizations including The Five Mountain Medical Community, Native Hawaiian Hospitality Association, and Native Hawaiian Culture and Arts Program - Bishop Museum.
	Listen to this interview and find out more about John’s rise to personal and professional success—all these and more only here on Greater Good Radio.

        <itunes:summary>	More than two years ago, Henry Montgomery saw a need to provide small companies in Hawaii professional accounting and financial services to help them stay afloat.  This mission—to provide smaller enterprises the same cost-effective accounting and financial management capabilities as the bigger organizations—became Montgomery Professional Services Corp. or MontPac’s primary driving force.

Indeed, not long before its establishment, MontPac has made significant impact on their clients, relying on the advantages of outsourcing and globalization.  
	“By leveraging outsourcing, small businesses can now obtain the type of “big company” accounting and financial management services at a fraction of the cost they would pay a U.S.-based accounting firm,” writes Henry in Outsourcing to Philippines (April 2008).
	Beyond cost arbitration, Henry also trusts that his company helps in the professional and economic upliftment of their employees offshore.
	MontPac serves as a textbook model of an organization leveraging outsourced talents to provide quality service and create much needed career opportunities otherwise not afforded in developing countries.
	Henry has held esteemed tenures in a wide array of organizations including Memorex, Fairchild Camera and Instrument, McKinsey &#038; Company and Arthur Andersen &#038; Company.  He co-authored &#8220;Enron Provides Lessons on Audits for Accountants and Public Companies&#8221; for the Washington Legal Foundation, and &#8220;Directors Need to Set the Tone&#8221; for the Silicon Valley Biz Ink.
	His vast corporate and professional experience aside, Henry is actively engaged in the non-profit arena.  Today he sits as treasurer to the Honolulu Symphony, a task perfectly aligned with his skills. 
	In this interview, Henry narrates his extensive professional background and his eventual foray in to entrepreneurship.  He shares with us the value of leveraging one’s skills and talents to create an impact to the wider community.
	Listen to this interview and find out why Henry chose to take on the entrepreneurial path after decades in the corporate setting.  Find out more about Henry Montgomery, chairman, chief executive officer and co-founder of MontPac, only here on Greater Good Radio.

        <itunes:summary>	Clinton Churchill&#8217;s personal and professional experience spans industries and geographies, and he uses this eclectic background as a tool to reach out to the community.
	A former commander of the Hawaii Air National Guard, Clint-who moved to the Islands with his wife 39 years ago-sits as trustee to The Estate of James Campbell, an organization administering the assets held in trust under the will of James Campbell.  He is also a Board member for the Bank of Hawaii and Hawaii Pacific Health, and an Executive Board Member and Past President of the Boy Scouts of America - Aloha Council

After retirement from the Air National Guard 12 years ago, Clint set up Acroflight Inc., an extreme air-tour company.  
	 Clint&#8217;s formula of work-life balance blends well for the 65-year old.  Despite the demands of his career, he is still able to a lot time for himself, and more importantly, spend time with his family.
	&#8220;Life is about priorities,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You have to figure out what you want to do and where your opportunities are-how to balance the different demands on your time.&#8221;
	&#8220;Family comes first,&#8221; Clint added.  &#8220;With family is really yourself.&#8221;
In the middle of it is a health-centered lifestyle which has helped him cope with the rigorous requirements of being a fighter pilot.
	&#8220;Exercise has always been important,&#8221; he claimed.  &#8220;Having an active life means being healthy.&#8221;
	&#8220;I found out that if I don&#8217;t get to exercise as much I have less energy.&#8221;
	An ethic of community service, the opportunity to serve, allowed Clint to move from organization to organization and experience different aspects of life.  Clint became involved early on in the Special Olympics and in healthcare through the Kapi&#8217;olani Medical Center, amongst countless others. 
	&#8220;Be engaged.  Be passionate about what you&#8217;re doing.  Be committed.&#8221; Clint advised.  &#8220;If you&#8217;re called on to do something, carry it through.&#8221; 
	In this interview, Clint shares his experiences as fighter pilot and subsequent commander of 154th Wing of the United States Air National Guard.  He also talks about the values he has acquired as a military personnel which he uses to this day as a social entrepreneur.
	Listen to this two-on-one conversation and find out about Clint&#8217;s career beginnings and what brought him to Hawaii and eventually become guardian of the skies as an Air Force pilot-all these and more only here on Greater Good Radio.

        <itunes:summary>	&#8220;I love being in charge of my own destiny,&#8221; says Carol Ai May, vice president and marketing manager of City Mill.
	Carol was born to a business-minded family, and tried to cultivate her entrepreneurial spirit while building a career in advertising after leaving college. She struggled while trying to climb the ranks but learned how to survive in the modern world.  She carved a successful career for herself in the advertising industry, but soon enough was asked to consider using her talents in marketing and advertising in the family business, City Mill.

Continuing to build the family business, Carol eventually followed her passion to apply in new businesses and founded Red Box Jewelry, and co-founded Simply Organized.
	Carol claims, &#8220;I love the entrepreneurial spirit,&#8221; and even goes as far as encouraging her own children, who are high-achievers in school, to venture into business rather than take on corporate roles.  
	Carol sits on the Board of a diverse set of community and social organizations including Child &#038; Family Service, Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii, UH Foundation, Parent Council, and University of Hawaii Arts &#038; Science Council.
	Exemplifying Carol&#8217;s entrepreneurial savvy and community dedication are the number of distinctions bestowed upon her through the years.  This includes 2007 Girl Scouts Women of Distinction Honoree, 2005 YWCA Leader Lunch Honoree, and a 2000 Small Business Hawaii Success Story awardee to name a few. 
	In this interview, Carol shares with us how she manages to juggle her time as mother and breadwinner. 
	Evan and Kari bring to the Greater Good fold Carol Ai May and her thoughts on female corporate and familial leadership.  Listen now and find out how Carol breaks through the glass ceiling, as a woman and child born to a traditional Chinese family-these and more only on Greater Good Radio.

After graduating from Stanford University in 1975, Jim joined the faculty of the Robert Louis Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, California, and rose through the school&#8217;s professional faculty ranks to become Academic Dean.  
	During his tenure at Stevenson, he earned an M.A. Degree in Private School Leadership at the University of San Francisco.  After eight years at the Stevenson School, he entered Harvard University to work on his doctorate degree in Administration, Planning and Social Policy and earned his Master’s Degree in that field in 1985, and his doctorate in 1991.  Jim was Headmaster of Catlin Gabel School in Portland, Oregon, prior to coming to Punahou where he has been tenured since 1993.

But getting in to the education sector was the farthest from Jim’s mind as a kid growing up in Hawaii.  
	“I thought I was going to law school after college,” he said.  “As a kid, politics was my primary goal.”
	This line of thought was born from more than a decade of involvement with the Punahou School.  
	“I think from the very beginning, this notion of public service was ingrained in me during my 13 years at Punahou,” Jim said.  “It might have been the school programs, or my teachers and coaches—all of them seem to have lived fulfilled lives.”
	Everything else seems to have just fallen onto their rightful place.    It may be serendipitous that Jim landed the presidency of one of Hawaii’s premier primary and secondary education institutions.  He is only the third president of Punahou School since World War II.
	“It’s not a job you can plan for,” Jim remarked.  “The position at Punahou opens every generation&#8212;there’s a lot of continuity, tradition, history, and longevity. “
	In this foremost Greater Good Radio interview for 2009, Jim talks about the advantage of Hawaiians in the global setting.  He said that there is something different and special about growing up in Hawaii and being exposed to a multicultural setting—a plus factor for president-elect Barrack Obama who once sat in class and mingled with classmates at Punahou School.

        <itunes:summary>	Walter Kirimitsu is the first non-clergyman to lead Saint Louis Schools Hawaii in its 160-year history.  Walter, a former Appeals Court Judge for Hawaii, sits as president, headmaster and chief executive officer of Saint Louis.
	He is a member of Saint Louis’ Gallery of Distinguished Achievers for his community leadership and outstanding contribution to the betterment of Hawaii and for upholding the banner as an exemplary Saint Louis gentleman.

Walter has displayed leadership qualities throughout his career, having been elected president of the Saint Louis student body council, president of the Associated Students of University of Hawaii, president of the Hawaii State Bar Association, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Saint Louis School, to mention a few.
	Greater Good Radio hosts Evan and Kari Leong talks to Walter about his career and the different challenges he has faced in his multi-faceted track record.  Walter, who has sat in the Board of Trustees of Saint Louis for many years, mentions that the presidency turned out to be much harder than initially thought.
	“The issues are much more evident being in the administrative position,” he remarked.
	But despite the blockades, Walter continues to push through with his mission of serving the community, primarily through education and volunteerism.
	“Memor et Fidelis, mindful and faithful, I take that mantra very seriously,” he said.
	“I’m very interested in doing what I can to perpetuate the lessons I’ve learned throughout life,” he said.  “I can honestly say that the conversations I’ve had with law clerks were the best times in my judicial days.  It was a great opportunity to shape their young minds.”
	Walter, who to this day serves the Specialty Courts of the Family Court, vouches for the importance of respect in personal and professional success. 
	“Respect to me is the fundamental value that one has to learn in order to be successful,” he mentioned.  “From respect, you develop people relationship and leadership qualities.”
	In this interview, Walter narrates the milestones that have led him to become a Hawaii judge, and talks about the importance of providing education to public and private schools about the country’s judicial system.

        <itunes:summary>	With little knowledge of the language, culture, and the country in general, Dominique Lemay left France for the Philippines more than two decades ago with an assignment as a social worker… barely knowing that he would stay for a long term.
	Five years from his arrival in the country, Dominique founded Virlanie Foundation, one of the country’s largest organization catering to street children and their families.  
	Dominique Lemay, social worker, founding president of Virlanie foundation and People Asia’s People of the Year 2008 awardee, talks about the why he left France and a relatively comfortable life to effectuate change in a community 13,000 kilometers away from his homeland.
	Listen to or read this interview as Dominique speaks to Greater Good Philippines about how he has come to love the Philippines and adopt to its culture, one that is far from his own.

Jay-R Patron:  We’re here with Dominique Lemay, founding president of Virlanie Foundation.  You founded Virlanie in 1992?
	Dominique Lemay:  1992, yes.  
	Jay-R Patron:  What do you do as president of the organization?
	Dominique Lemay:  I have three or four different ways to work at Virlanie.  As founder, I try to keep the mission from the beginning of the foundation.  Our mission is very simple, to take care and love our children, to give education to them and teach them to be responsible adults.  The second thing is, when I am abroad or even here in the Philippines, we need money.  Now we have one group to do that but before I was in charge of raising funds for the foundation.  Number three, I am here not to stay here in my office.  I am here also to go everywhere—to visit the children, to look into our programs, and to go outside to the streets and the bigger community to see what the problem is with the poor people and the children.  Number four, for me it’s also to think about the future of the foundation.  What is the challenge today?  What will happen in five years, ten years?  Find the problems today and try to give answers to these.  Today, I’m working with children 15 years old and below, because two years we had a new law.  The law said that we cannot put children below 15 in jail but unfortunately, we continue to put children below 15 in jail, for different reasons.  The challenge today is to try to push the politicians and the government to the change the ways and try to give answers to this problem.
	Jay-R Patron:  What is an ordinary day at work to you like?  I know you have mentioned that you have different tasks, but what about when you’re in the office?
	Dominique Lemay:  In the office, if I’m still in the office, I answer to my emails, I meet the staff, and I also go around the office.  Sometimes I go, two times a week, outside to the jails, in the streets, to the province, but not so much anymore.  I miss that.  I feel that I’ve become too much administrative but you know if you’re the boss you have to make time for this.  I’m a social worker and sociologist, I’m not an administrative guy or a manager but I have to do that.
	Jay-R Patron:  Briefly, will you tell us what Virlanie Foundation is?  What does it do?
	Dominique Lemay:  I’ll tell you the most important for me.  We started Virlanie Foundation to take care of the children that people do not like to take care.  That means if I go to jail, if I walk in the streets and see children, in my mind I see that I should take care of them.  Why do I have to take care of them if they have mothers?  We started the program to address a specific need. The foundation is ready to answer to that.  Of course, we have families because the children come from families, we also take care of the families.  20 years ago we have many children in the streets, now we have families in the streets, why?  Because the children become adults, live together in the streets and then have children.  Before we had the tendency to separate the child.  It is a big problem to separate the kids from their families to put in to homes.  We have to keep the family as one, keep them all together.  It’s like that.  
	Jay-R Patron:  How many children are there in total that is under Virlanie Foundation?  
	Dominique Lemay:  Inside the 13 homes we have 270 children, from zero, because they are babies, to 23.  And we have an area for special children.  Of course, even if the child turns 22 or 23 years old, from children they become adults, we cannot tell them to go.  If you’re a special person and we let you out in the streets, what will happen to you?  We have two homes in the province, in Cavite, to take care of them.  We train them to make various products.
	Jay-R Patron:  What was your drive in putting up this kind of organization?
	Dominique Lemay:  Good question.  Before I came here I was working in Caritas France.  I try in my own way, and I’m not perfect, to follow the gospel.  The gospel teaches that you have to love others and love yourself.  What’s important is to try to follow the gospel, take care and love the people, particularly the children.  That’s what I do, to take care of the children.  Particularly as a Christian I have to do that.  Second thing is, I have received many gifts in my life—from my parents and others.  I have to give back.  For me it’s not a job, it’s my life.
	Jay-R Patron:  You first came to the country in 1987, what made you come to the Philippines?
	Dominique Lemay:  A French NGO asked me to come here but I didn’t know anything about the country, as in zero.  Imagine 13,000 kilometers away from my country, from France.  
	Jay-R Patron:  What was your first impression of the country?
	Dominique Lemay:  When I arrived here, I only knew two names—Marcos and Cory Aquino.  I didn’t speak English.  Of course, I didn’t speak Tagalog.  Imagine, I went here to make a study.  The one in charge, the president of this NGO called me, “Dominique, you have money, maybe you can start a non-profit for children in Manila.”  I said, “Why?  I don’t know anything about the Philippines.”  She said, “You go there for one or two years, you go back to France.  You just start the NGO.”  I remember in Paris I worked in one church.  I went inside the church and prayed to God.  When I walked out of the church I wanted to know what I had to do, if I should stay in France or go to the Philippines.  When I went outside, I felt like I had to come here.  I went here for two years and flew back to France and worked for a big NGO.  After six months, I felt like I have not done what I had to do here.  So I came back.
	Jay-R Patron:  What has made you stay in the country?
	Dominique Lemay:  In my mind really, I feel comfortable in the country.  I’ve been to Africa, to South America to do some programs but, because my character—the way I walk—it’s compatible with Filipinos.  Of course, we have very different cultures.  Even after 20 years, sometimes I still don’t understand my staff.  But I say always, in Virlanie we have two different cultures but we respect each other.  And two have two different cultures, it’s much better as we can grow faster and better.  But it’s not always easy.  Sometimes my staff goes, “Dominique is going crazy again.”  But my staff also knows how to play with me.  
	Jay-R Patron:  What do you think are the traits of Filipinos that you find unique?  
	Dominique Lemay:  I feel that Filipinos are very open.  I feel that anyone can work with you.  What I say is that you have to respect each other.  Even if you don’t understand each other you have to respect.  You have your character, I have my character; you have your culture, I have my culture, and what I like about Filipinos is that they respect, and also, of course, the smiling.  When my friends ask me about Filipinos I say that they are really Asian people.  In my culture, to go from point A to point B, I will go directly.  But as Filipinos, you don’t go straight—you go up, right, left—and maybe someday you will at B.  But you still get to point B.  It’s two different ways and I respect the other way also.  After 20 years, I’ve known the character of Filipinos but what’s nice also is that every time I discover new and different things.  In my heart, I don’t want to go back to France.  I feel very comfortable here.
	Jay-R Patron:  And you have European volunteers.  How many are they?
	Dominique Lemay:  Around 30.  
	Jay-R Patron:  That’s a lot.  And they come from which countries?
	Dominique Lemay:  Many from France, Switzerland, Belguim, Germany, European countries.  But we also have in Canada in Quebec because we have a branch there.  We also have volunteers from Korea, we have a Korean foundation.  
	Jay-R Patron:  What do you do outside Virlanie?  What do you do for fun?  Do you have any hobbies?
	Dominique Lemay:  I have that (points to the aquarium), the fish.  I have aquariums everywhere but I don’t have much time to take care.  Before, I did a lot of feeding and cleaning but not so much now.  Last year, I was crazy about making a stamp collection.  When I was younger I did that.  I also like to read, and watch movies.  
	Jay-R Patron:  Do you watch classical French movies?
	Dominique Lemay:   I watch a lot of American films.  I also do watch French movies.  I’m very open to different genres.  But what I don’t like, and Filipinos like very much, are horror movies.  Actually that’s one of the differences between Europeans and Asians, even Americans because they like horror movies.  
	Jay-R Patron:  How did your career as a social worker start?
	Dominique Lemay:  When I was small I was in seminary.  I made some accounting studies and when I was 25 years old, Caritas asked me if I wanted to work in one center in Paris.  After 10 years in Caritas, I took a Masters in social work.  In France, you have to have social work experience to have your Masters.
	Jay-R Patron:  So you don’t have your formal classroom program to get your Masters?
	Dominique Lemay:  In the beginning no.  I worked in the field.  It’s good also because after one year in school you make your Master outside.  But you have to work for 10 years.
	Jay-R Patron:  How was your life back in France?  Can you describe how life was when you were younger?
	Dominique Lemay:  I have a family—three brothers and one sister, we’re five.  My father was an engineer for a big company, my mother stayed home and took care of us.  Even when I was younger I wanted to do good.  That’s why I went to the seminar.  In France, in the ‘50s there was a revolution in people’s way of thinking.  So in the seminary we started studying outside, not inside.  I was 22, 23 years old.
	Jay-R Patron:  How does family play in molding you as a person?
	Dominique Lemay:  I have children.  Four daughters, two in France and two here.  I realized, to do this kind of job, to be very busy, it’s difficult to have a family.  My daughter, one day she said, “You know papa, I want to do what you are doing.”  It was a long time ago but she continues to say that.  “When you become old, I’ll take your place.”  It’s difficult.  I know I don’t spend enough of my time for my children.  But my teacher in philosophy said that if you want some things, you have to say no to other things.  It’s difficult, for me, to be a president or founder of an organization and lead a family life.  I try to spend time with them, go out on the weekends or go on vacations.  
	Jay-R Patron:  How about faith?  How does faith play in your life?
	Dominique Lemay:  Very important.  I’m not the guy who prays every time.  But what I believe totally is that I am not alone to do this job.  I lost my son 10 years ago, and I am sure that he is with me to do this job.  He is God or somewhere, I don’t know where.  But I believe that he is with me to do this job.  Because I know I am not capable in doing this alone.  To believe in God, for me, is very important.  Because if I’m here to do this job, I believe that God asked me to do that.  Why did I come here?  Imagine I’m 13,000 kilometers away.  Why did I come to the Philippines?  I didn’t speak English, I didn’t speak Tagalog, and I didn’t know anything about the country, but I knew I had to start a foundation.  My faith in God gave me the permission to do that.  I think God asked me to do that and gave me the opportunity to do that.  I feel it’s like that.  I’m not perfect, I’m a sinner.  I don’t pray that much, but many people pray for me.
	Jay-R Patron:  Why is it important for people to give back, volunteer, engage in causes greater than themselves?
	Dominique Lemay:  When God asked me to be here, I’m very very happy to do that.  If I don’t do this job, I won’t be happy.  I would be frustrated.  I do this because it makes me happy.  If I’m not happy, I won’t do this job.
	Jay-R Patron:  What has been your greatest challenge and how did you overcome it?
	Dominique Lemay:  My first challenge was working with poor people in France because I didn’t know anything.  But that was my way to give back.  Now, when you talk about the Philippines, before I arrived here, I’ve read about the country in the newspapers and magazine.  In Paris, it was very violent because of the drug problem.  I said to myself, “If I didn’t work with street children, what will happen to me?”  What was happening in France was already violent.  For me, it was a big challenge to come here.  What I like to do here is really to try to change the people, the children.  If I can see one child smiling, for me that is progression from the challenge.  But we always have challenge, and that’s what I like also in my life.  Every time there’s new challenge.  If we finish something we have to do other things.
	Jay-R Patron:  What would you consider as your greatest life achievement?
	Dominique Lemay:  I think Virlanie, this foundation.  And I hope we continue this somewhere, I don’t know where.
	Jay-R Patron:  If there was one message that you would like to tell our readers or listeners about our conversation tonight, what would that message be?
	Dominique Lemay:  Always smile.  What I say to my staff, when they’re down, when they’re upset, to smile only.  When you go to the street, when you go everywhere, when you see one child or a family, smile at them, you don’t have to give money.  Maybe that can change their life.  You don’t have to do big things to change a life.  
	Jay-R Patron:  What can we expect from Dominique and Virlanie in the next months, years?
	Dominique Lemay:  We have to stabilize the foundation.  With the big problem in the world, we might have problems with sponsorship.  We have to stabilize financially the foundation.  But as always, we’re going to give the best we can give to our children, to our families.  Even in 10 years, we will continue to give.  You always have to try to push and say to yourself that even if it’s difficult today, because the children need that.  So many things happen to those children and they need even more of what we give them.  I say to the people when they ask why we need to do this to the children.  I say, “What you do with your own children, you have to do with them.”  There’s no difference.  This is what I want to say to my staff and to the people.  If no people love them, what will happen in their life?
	Jay-R Patron:  That’s it.  Thank you so much.

        <itunes:summary>	Barbara Hastings and Barbra Pleadwell are partners at one of Hawaii’s top 10 PR firms, Hastings &#038; Pleadwell.  H&#038;P has worked on environmental preservation, recycling, illegal dumping, tobacco control and homelessness.  They maintain their commitment to education through mentorship and an internship program at the firm.  
	To celebrate their 10th anniversary, Hastings &#038; Pleadwell launched a campaign called 10 Good Deeds for 10 Great Years.  The partners have been and are currently involved in a number of non-profit organizations and community initiatives.

“We put together a series of workshops that benefited people who might otherwise not be able to pay for them and we did pro bono public relations for campaigns that might have otherwise gone without,” says Pleadwell.
	Helping the community is deeply embedded in the heart and soul of H&#038;P as a company—with its principal owners actively engaging in charity.  According to Hastings, community giving has been an integral part of themselves, having been exposed to a multitude of dire situations, and their business as a public relations firm.
	“It’s part of the bedrock of who we are as well us who our agency is,” Hastings says.  “We had a lot of experience in this community with the need of people in the community – from health needs to food needs to environmental needs.”  
	She adds, “because we were in that field and we learned a lot in our communication tactics on the grassroots level, we learned those as a result of trying to help some of these disparate communities so we used some of that for our for-profit clients but we also want to give back to the community that help educate us.”
	In this interview, the partners take us in to the beginnings of their PR firm, and the challenges that have had to overcome to attain their current position as one of Hawaii’s best public relations companies.  They talk about mentorship, friendship, and developing and maintaining relationships with clients and the community.
	Greater Good Radio brings Barbra Hastings &#038; Barbara Pleadwell, two female powerhouse figures in Hawaii’s PR industry.  Listen now.

        <itunes:summary>	“What I saw in the Concierge at Ward was an opportunity to build relationships,” says Pono Shim, who has worked for Ward Properties for 17 years.  Seeing an open door to entrepreneurship, Pono accepted the concierge service for the Ward 16 Theatre, becoming its first strategic partner—and beyond this, he saw a brighter prospect in being able to bring individuals and businesses together.
	Today, the Concierge Services at Ward plays an important role in meshing people and building stronger ties within the Islands’ populace—and what started as a way of “keeping in touch” with friends and family has grown into a database of over 10,000 long term and trusted relationships.
Officially opening in August of 2001, the company strives in building value to consumers and revenues for partnered businesses and organizations.

According to Pono, the primary focus of their business operations has relationship marketing at the core.  By serving customers they hope to build trust and loyalty, and through the developed relationship build unique marketing programs.
	In this interview, Pono shares one of his experiences as a volunteer on the committee that chaired the Ho’olaulea at Kamehameha Schools.  One of their projects is a food drive for the poor.  As Pono makes an inventory of their collection, he comes across a plastic bag, which contains a cup and a half of flour.
	Pono explains that this donation is probably the most important of all they have collected.  The person who has donated it has probably given all or most of what he or she has.
	Greater Good Radio brings Pono Shim, entrepreneur and relationship marketing advocate, and his story about acceptance and invitation.  Listen to this interview and hear more about his narration, which has been included in The Greater Good: Life Lessons from Hawaii’s Leaders.
	All these and more only here on Greater Good Radio.
	BIO:
Pono Shim is the marketing executive and founder of Concierge Services at Ward.  Son of Alvin Shim, labor law specialist and attorney, and mother Marion Heen Shim, daughter of Honolulu City Councilman, Ernest Nalani Heen Sr, and her brother Walter Heen, Pono credits his business acumen and sound value system to God and his amazing family mentored environment.
	In his desire to bring the same five-star standard to the residents of Hawaii, Concierge Services was conceived, and Ward Cinema became its first strategic partner
	Utilizing the current and constantly evolving email network, as a means of communication, products and services are developed in response to his network of membership-for-value business. 
	Developing a reservation system for the largest cinema in the state, he expanded his membership services to include specials and discounts for his valued friends and network, from like-minded businesses who share his vision to provide the people of Hawaii products that are priced to accommodate the budgetary constraints of calling Hawaii their home.  Hotel concierge services which were exclusive to the visitor, is now provided to the resident, through Concierge Services, with products that are designed and priced with the local consumer in mind.
	In response to the growing needs of this network, he met with neighboring businesses to learn about their products and services and collaborated on developing a value packed package with Ryan’s Grill &#038; Bar, Dave &#038; Buster’s, and Border’s Books, to name a few.
	His constant update of more products and services has stirred interest in this new advertising venue, by many resident consumer driven businesses and the membership-for-value business model standard is the focus of developing new partnerships. 
	This model is fueled by his passion to improve the quality of life for the youth and future generations of Hawaii. Based on his standard of excellence philosophy, Pono has translated this to be service, loyalty and sensitivity, the characteristics that are inherent in the relationships he maintains. 
	With his beliefs about the potential of the youth of Hawaii, he is building a business that would allow them to realize their opportunities for success, which are not limited by the educational and economic norms of today.  This philosophy has him continually updating his business to include the fast growing technology and trends of today and educating and communicating these changes to his ever-increasing membership. He believes that with every technological advancement and loss of employment, there are enormous amounts of opportunities, and he struggles to maintain and communicate the service, loyalty and sensitivity in current and potential partnerships.
	What started as a way of “keeping in touch” with friends and family has grown into a database of over 10,000 long term and trusted relationships.  It is this trust that he has translated into a business model, he hopes will grow to meet his vision of empowering the people of Hawaii with the confidence to meet and grow with the ever-changing new Hawaii, regardless of educational credited shortfalls.
	His belief in challenging the youth, to compete in the fast paced world of today, without losing the value and integrity based in the family unit, has him involved in an increasing list of speaking engagements.
	He is also the current President of Kamehameha School’s Association of Teachers and Parents.  A founder of Pacific Wave Marketing LLC which is the IT Marketing Company which is licensed to developed Oceanic Time Warner Cable’s Kupa’a Program.
	His consultation services have been used by, but are not limited to:

        <itunes:summary>	Any one can be of service to others and to the environment in their own special way.  Regardless of financial and physical capacity, an individual may perform a civic duty by getting down to the basics.  
	For Chris Harris, one of the partners at Intech Management, Shredex and Island Shell, it is by collecting trash during a leisurely walk along the beach.  Having a strong connection with the ocean, Chris volunteers for the Surfrider Foundation and has been involved with the Blue Water Task Force doing water testing back in college.

Albeit not as actively involved as he hopes, Chris tries to fulfill his share to that piece of community obligation the best way he normally can by picking up rubbish.
	“I’m not as active as I&#8217;d like to be in the Surfrider Foundation but when they had the beach clean up days, I definitely participate in that,” he said.  “On a personal note, everyday when you go to the beach you can make a big difference just by picking trash up – just by breaking it down to the real basic stuff.”
	Greater Good brings Chris Harris, serial entrepreneur, to the airwaves talking about the importance of providence and care for nature.  In this interview, Chris mentions how he has learned to save and shares to listeners how he has come to value investing in the future.
	Find out more about Chris’ involvement in the community and the environment—and how his companies’ activities interweave to provide an effective and efficient production process.  All these and more only on Greater Good Radio.

        <itunes:summary>	Ron Nagasawa joined then fledgling Midweek in 1984 as a sales assistant.  Staying with the company for 24 years, Ron has seen the growth and development of the publication, which today has more than half a million in circulation.  Ron stepped up as publisher in 2001.
	In this Greater Good Radio interview, he talks about the beginnings of his career working for a foundation catering to disabled children in California.  Moving to Hawaii as a teacher for the Department of Education, Ron has worked with special children, which touched his heart and taught him many valuables lessons in life.

Ron also talks about how he has landed the job at MidWeek.  He shares how the publishing company enacts a community service—being an effective tool in disseminating information.  He mentions the magazines Most Wanted in Hawaii issues, which has gathered a well-deserved applause from civic groups and anti-crime organizations particularly the Crime Stoppers.  
	“It’s really effective and I think one year we had a 100 percent capture rate but every year it’s really very high and we’ve received awards from Crime Stoppers for being an effective media,” Ron said.  “In that sense again, it’s just really a tool by which we can help serve the community.”

        <itunes:summary>	Stan Masamitsu not only inherited a thriving business in a dynamic industry, he has also been imbibed, through his parents, with a heart and mind veered towards helping other people—albeit initially, Stan’s intention of joining non-profits was to publicize his company.  But to Stan, being able to contribute in a charitable way has had its greater fulfillment.
	“As I was getting involved in some of these non-profits I have personal satisfaction in knowing that I could be of assistance to somebody,” he said.

Stan is the brain behind Tony Group Autoplex, Hawaii’s first auto mall.  Stan conceptualized, built, and relocated dealerships into the complex, which began servicing the public in 2001.  He was named “40 under 40” Business Leader of the Year by Pacific Business news in 2006.  In 2007, Stan is nominated for the Time Magazine Quality Dealer Award.
	In this Greater Good Radio exclusive, Stan talks about the pros and cons of being the “boss’ son” and how he has proved himself worthy of being the company’s top honcho.  He also shares the value of being able to physically be in contact with his employees, which number to more than 500 individuals.
	“I don’t have an opportunity to talk to a lot of customers on a daily level so what I end up doing is more trying to have a connection with the people I work with so they basically become the extension of me,” he said.  “Just walking around or going on lunch with them or publicly recognizing them with something good that they did.”
	All these and more only here on Greater Good Radio.  And have your copy of The Greater Good: Life Lesson’s From Hawaii’s Leaders signed on Tuesday, November 13 at 6pm at Barnes &#038; Noble Ala Moana, and Saturday, November 17 at 12.00pm at Borders Ward Ave.

        <itunes:summary>	Greater Good Radio brings Barron Guss, president and chief executive officer of Hawaii’s largest human resources company, ALTRES.  During his free time, he can be found putting his imagination to work in design and technology projects.  He is a holder of three U.S. patents including a baby bottle design and a microchip-based, radio-frequency time and attendance system.
	He also designs radio control model aircraft and is invited to do flight demonstrations throughout the world.
	On top of his seemingly busy lifestyle, Barron actively supports the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Parents and Children Together (PACT), Blood Bank of Hawaii, and Adopt-a-Platoon.  He is currently President of the Board at Academy of the Pacific in Honolulu and is the former President of Temple Emanu-El in Honolulu. He is Rotarian and a lifetime member of the Academy of Model Aeronautics.

 In this interview, Barron talks about the importance of mentorship and open communication between family members involved in business.  He says that it is essential for parents to open up to their children and talk to them about their decisions and the reasoning behind their choices.
	“I’ve noticed in a lot of family businesses that the parent themselves forget to tell the child what they’re thinking; they forget to tell the child why they do things,” Barron says.  “I think what happens is parents assume – because this is my child, this is my offspring, they’re supposed to think like me, be like me, a chip off the old book.”
	“Communicate to your children – let them know specifically why you’ve made the choices,” he adds.
	Learn more about the different hues of family-run businesses and Barron Guss’ view about succession and why it does not necessarily have to be your own children to sit next at the helm.  All these only here on Greater Good Radio.  
	BIO:
Barron Guss is the President and CEO of ALTRES, Hawaii’s largest human resources company, serving hundreds of client companies and thousands of worksite employees on six islands. His father Bill Guss founded ALTRES in Honolulu in 1969 as a staffing services firm, and in the late 1980s, Barron Guss launched the company’s professional employer organization (PEO) division to provide outsourced human resource administration services.
	Since that time Mr. Guss has served the PEO industry and Hawaii’s employers through his lobbying efforts on both federal and state levels. In addition he is a former board member of the National Association of PEOs (NAPEO) and a current board member of ESAC, the national accreditation body for PEOs.  In 2000 ALTRES was ranked the #1 PEO in the nation by Professional Employers Journal.
	When he’s not helping client companies find a better way of doing business, he can be found putting his imagination to work in design and technology projects. He is a holder of three U.S. patents—including a baby bottle design and a microchip-based, radio-frequency time and attendance system. He also designs radio control model aircraft and is invited to do flight demonstrations throughout the world.  
	Mr. Guss enjoys family time with his wife Dede, and children, Raquel 18, Zachary 16, and Madison 15.  He has a long history of volunteerism, including active support for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, Parents and Children Together (PACT), Blood Bank of Hawaii, and Adopt-a-Platoon.  He is currently President of the Board at Academy of the Pacific in Honolulu and is the former President of Temple Emanu-El in Honolulu. He is Rotarian and a lifetime member of the Academy of Model Aeronautics.

        <itunes:summary>	Greater Good Radio brings to the airwaves Dustin Sellers, co-founder of ProService Hawaii, one of Hawaii’s largest outsourced employee administration companies.  In this interview, Dustin talks about the inception of ProService and its “soulful” origin – having been founded in the outer islands.
	He shares his opinion about soccer and why he believes that the state will be able to produce top-notch talents to represent the whole country.  Dustin likens the sport to business, which he says “is a long game with a few goals that make all the difference”.

ProService Hawaii represents close to $200 million in payroll with the average company having 20 or less employees.  Dustin leads this dynamic organization in both its business and community endeavors.
	“We spend about 300,000 dollars a year in the traditional large charitable donations but we do a lot of giving back to the community through giving our services for free,” Dustin says.  “There’s a number of organizations that we’re talking to now that we feel are doing really unique things in the market place where we can actually provide our services for free; giving them great healthcare rates, great workers comp rates, great TDI, in a way that they could not afford normally because they’re non-profits.”
	Dustin is on the advisory council for the Nature Conservancy and on the board of directors for Honolulu Bulls.  
	Listen and find out more about Dustin Sellers with his stories on the ups and downs of being an entrepreneur.

        <itunes:summary>	Greater Good features Mark and Cheryl Richards, founders and executives of The Maryl Group, a company that has earned an enviable reputation for master planned communities, commercial centers, custom residential homes, island architecture and impeccable construction.  
	In this interview, Mark and Cheryl share how they have wound up in Hawaii, engaging in the cyclical world of real estate when they have left a heavy equipment parts manufacturing business in California all for the very same reason.  This time around, the couple has been well equipped and fully prepared to face the uncertainties of new beginnings.  And with the help of the community, the Richards have faced the challenges head on.  Over time, they have built one of the most successful real estate firms in Hawaii.
	Maybe it is the partnership, the kindred spirits, that guide Mark and Cheryl towards successful personal and business lives.  They have been working together for more than three decades and their chemistry has worked on their favor. 
	“We’ve sat next to each other for 30 years now and everyone we know says, ‘How do you do this?’,” Mark said.  “It’s how we met, it’s how we grew up together.  So it’s the way we understand the world works; doesn’t work for everybody but it has worked for us really well.”
	Listen now and find out more about Maryl Group and the Richards – only here on Greater Good Radio. 
	BIO:
Mark Richards
In 1970, Mark Richards founded Racor Industries, Inc., which has become the world’s largest producer of diesel fuel filtration systems.  Growing to sales of $16 million in 1984, Racor was acquired by Parker Hannifin Corporation in 1985, then a $1.6 billion NYSE Fortune 500 Company.  Mark continued as General Manager of the Racor Division through 1986, when he moved to a consulting role in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii and founded a real estate development company.  
	Mark Richards is the President and Chief Executive Officer of Maryl Group, Inc.  From a three-person real estate development company, Maryl Group, Inc. has successfully expanded to become a company of statewide dimension that has earned an enviable reputation over two decades of real estate development, architecture, construction and sales and leasing of master planned communities, commercial centers, and custom residential homes.
	Many developers grew up in the construction business.  Maryl grew up in the manufacturing business where quality is measured in microns.  The rigorous performance measures done in the manufacturing business are almost unheard of in the world of hammers and nails, but to those who work with Maryl, they have instilled a discipline and attention to detail that virtually guarantees superior results. 
	To Mark, people make the difference.  Cliché, certainly, but equally certain is that people are the foundation and fuel behind Maryl’s extraordinary success.  The consistent and surprising quality of each and every project, regardless of size or cost per square foot, owes to the dedication of what are unquestionably the most talented people in the islands.  Mark’s culture for compassion and generosity rewards initiative and extra effort.  His values have filtered through the hearts of his team members and are the fundamental reason for Maryl’s and his own excellent reputation.
	In addition to his strong leadership and desire to aid his team members grow both professionally and personally, Mark makes the extra effort to give back to the community.  In 2006, the Richards’ and the Maryl companies have donated over $157,000.00 to various Hawaii charities including Adult Friends for Youth, Leadership Kaua’i, and the University of Hawaii - School of Architecture, just to name a few.   
	Maryl’s company vision, which Mark helped establish, best represents his personal philosophy.
	Maryl is a family of dedicated professionals, delivering innovative solutions and services with integrity and quality that exceed our customer’s expectations.  We are committed to improving the quality of life in our community.
	Cheryl Richards
After moving back to her hometown of Modesto California from San Diego in 1978, Cheryl Richards began working with Mark at Racor Industries in Modesto as his Executive Assistant.  In 1981 they married.  During this time, Racor became investors in a construction partnership with a close friend and general contractor.  They discovered they greatly enjoyed working together in design and construction.  Having fallen in love with Kona while vacationing there, and realizing the opportunity for real estate development on the Big Island, they made plans to move to Hawaii following the sale of Racor. 
	In February of 1987 they moved to Kona, and with Cheryl’s sister, Janine, began Maryl Development.  They decided on the name Maryl as a combination of their names.  Cheryl Richards is Vice President and Secretary of what has now become Maryl Group, Inc. with approximately 250 employees.  She works with every aspect of the company; working with the architects on design input, the finish materials and specifications selected for Maryl custom homes, and works with local designers in beautifully furnishing Maryl model homes, as well as Maryl offices on all islands.  She is in charge of planning the annual family picnic, as well as the annual holiday employee appreciation party.  She loves every aspect of her responsibilities with Maryl.
	A significant segment of Cheryl’s schedule is involved in all company contributions, believing in the importance of Maryl giving back to the community.  While contributing to the major needs of our state we also love supporting the keiki of Maryl employees in sports and special fundraisers.  While sponsoring many endeavors to support the youth in our community, Cheryl is also currently involved in the start of donating her personal time to the Kapiolani Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Honolulu, which has affiliations on all islands.
	With the marriage of Mark and Cheryl, together they have four children and eight grandchildren, which is a major source of pride and fun for them.
	To both Cheryl and Mark, Maryl is a great source of pride and love.  They believe in working hard, and having fun doing it!  As a result it is a great place to work and for the second year in a row has been voted the number one employer in the state of Hawaii.  This is because of each and every person that works at Maryl, it is not just a job, it is also family.

	Edgy uses film and the visual media to promote Hawaii to the world and uplift the cause of the marginalized people of the Islands.  She has received various accolades from a number of award-giving bodies including the Aloha Filmmakers Visionary Award at the 2005 Molokai Film Festival, Honolulu Star-Bulletin’s Ten Who Made A Difference in 2005, and Best Cinematography in the 2002 New York International Independent Film &#038;Video Festival.

In 2007 Edgy founded Pacific Network (www.PacificNetwork.tv), an Internet network of nine channels as a &#8220;Native Hawaiian portal to the world&#8221;.  Alliances include Time Warner Telecom, KGMB9 (CBS Hawaii affiliate), Hawaii Public Radio, University of Hawaii, Hawaii Business, Network Media, and several media resources including museums, travel and health organizations.
Evan and Kari Leong talks with Edgy about her career, how she has started in the film industry, and the various prominent film and music talents that she has collaborated with through the years.  She talks about Pacific Network, and the inspiration behind this kind of programming that works as the world’s window into Hawaii, its people and their culture.
	“30 percent of our programming is directly focused to reach native Hawaiians and one of our biggest mandates is to reach 450 thousand native Hawaiians who live all around the world,” she says.  “We know where they are for the most part in the United States, we would like to reach them and we also like to get them to talk to each other.”  
	Listen to this interview and hear more from Edgy Lee as she talks about the Hawaiian concept of Laulima or working together to achieve a common goal—referring to her media network and its sponsors who strive to connect the world to Hawaii through the visual medium.
	BIO:
	EDGY LEE  is a fifth generation Hawaii-born producer - filmmaker.  Her most recent film,
&#8220;The Hawaiians - Reflecting Spirit&#8221;, received rave national reviews and currently broadcasts
on PBS (American Public Television).  The film looks at Hawaii’s indigenous culture and their understanding of ecosystems oriented to sustainability; how the future of Hawaiians and
other native cultures impact others.  The film was presented at the opening of the Smithsonian Institution’s  Museum of the American Indian in Washington DC. 
	Edgy also produced two feature films on methamphetamine in unprecedented prime time simulcasts (eleven television stations through out the State of Hawaii) and continues to produce
short films on various social issues.  Other feature documentary work includes the award winning
“Waikiki In the Wake of Dreams” and “Paniolo O Hawaii ~ Cowboys of the Far West”.  
	Veteran Los Angeles Times film critic, Kevin Thomas, wrote &#8220;What Lee has done in irresistible
fashion is a splendid example of the enduring power of the traditional documentary. The kind
that brings alive an unfamiliar world in a straightforward manner that is as entertaining as it is informative.&#8221; 
	Other films include, “Papakolea, Story of Hawaiian Land”, recipient of the prestigious
Silver Award from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Independent Program.  In 1999
Edgy produced a CD with His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama,  a compilation of rare traditional
Tibetan music performed by Tibetan artists living in exile around the world, with narration by
Rev. Abraham Akaka and chant performed by Kumu John Lake.
	Classically trained in piano and violin, Edgy left Hawaii to study fine art at the San Francisco
Art Institute.  Living in California, she began modeling for the Nina Blanchard Agency and for the
next fifteen years, appeared in numerous television commercials, series &#038; feature films including
The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson and as co-host of the children&#8217;s series, &#8220;Bill Cosby&#8217;s Picture Pages&#8221;.  In 1987 she began to independently produce and write. As an in-studio record producer,
she worked with the late, famed Jamaican &#8220;Godfather of Reggae&#8221; Joe Higgs;  The Wailers, and other artists.  She has also composed music with jazz legend Wayne Shorter (CBS Records) and film composer,  Joseph Vitarelli. 
	Edgy’s latest project is scheduled to launch in Fall 2007.  It is the Pacific Network, an Internet network of nine channels designed as a “Native Hawaiian portal to the world”; a nexus for gathering and distributing news, entertainment, educational programs, event listings and interactive media.

        <itunes:summary>	Xerox has been credited for changing how we do business today.  The multinational company has invented the copier machine and, albeit lesser known, was behind a number of communication technology innovations that has marked the lifestyle revolution of our era – this includes the fax machine, laser printer, Ethernet, computer mouse and the first personal computer, the Alto.
	This leadership role has attracted Glenn Sexton to work and stick with the company – for 27 years and running.  Glenn started on sales and within five years has moved up to managerial level.  Today he is vice-president and general manager of Xerox Hawaii.

“Xerox is really on the forefront of many things,” he said.  “Technology of course, that has been well documented; but also developing people and training them formally and I really wanted to take advantage of those opportunities and also to be able to impart that on other employees and watch them grow to the organization.”  
	“In 27 years, I’ve had the pleasure and opportunity to watch others come on board, very inexperienced, but learn a lot and hopefully surpass me in many ways,” Glenn added.
	In this Greater Good Radio exclusive, Glenn talks about the value of experience and mentorship, and their importance in personal and professional growth.
	“There’s not substitute for experience,” he said.  “The best thing you can do is experience something, but you can’t experience everything, so the second best thing to do is to sit down with someone who has experienced things that you have not and learn from that person.”
	Listen now and find out more about Glenn Sexton – only here on Greater Good Radio. 
	BIO:
Glenn Sexton joined Xerox Corporation in Hawaii in 1980.  For three years he held several sales and marketing positions in Xerox Hawaii.
	In 1985, Glenn became Marketing Manager and fulfilled this role for four years and in 1986 and 1987 was named top Marketing Manager in the Nation.
	In January 1989, Glenn was appointed to the position of Sales Operations Manager, Western Region, headquartered in Orange County, CA.  For 18 months, his staff responsibilities included developing Marketing and Customer Satisfaction strategies, providing management training, and acting as an advisor to the Vice-President of the Western Region headquarters.
	In July of 1990, Glenn returned to Hawaii as the District Manager of Sales for Xerox Hawaii.  His geographic responsibilities encompassed Hawaii, Guam and Saipan.  In 1995, at age 35, he was promoted to Vice President &#038; General Manager for all operations in Hawaii and Micronesia – making Glenn the youngest person to hold a vice president/general manager title within the Xerox Corporation.
	Under Glenn’s leadership, Xerox Hawaii has become the most productive Xerox organization with the highest market share in the United States.  Xerox Hawaii employs over 250 employees and continues to be one of the corporation’s perennial top performers in customer loyalty, employee motivation, revenue and profit growth.
	In addition to chairing the Xerox Community Involvement program, Glenn’s community support efforts includes membership in the Board of Directors of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Hawaii, Rehab Hospital of the Pacific, Rehab Foundation and the Hawaii Educational Council.
	Glenn was born in Japan and resided there for 6 years.  He has lived throughout the mainland United States, but spent more than 30 years on Oahu.  He is a graduate of Leilehua High School and the University of Hawaii where he graduated with honors and a degree in English.  He and wife, Margie, have a 16-year-old son named Nicholas and a 13-year-old daughter named Kelsey.

        <itunes:summary>	Max Botticelli has been unwaveringly involved in Hawaii’s healthcare industry for more than five decades, and has been at the forefront in advancing the state of healthcare in the islands for many years.

He is firmly dedicated to saving people’s lives both in and out of business.  Max has been a member of a number of community healthcare institutions over the years and currently sits on the board of directors of Waikiki Health Center.
	Max believes that a key ingredient to running a successful organization and managing hundreds of employees is to have a common goal and unity in direction.

        <itunes:summary>	Moving is a stressful venture, according to president and CEO, Rebecca Parker, 20-year veteran of one of the largest and most progressive moving firms in the Pacific.  It is by taking care of the clients, and not just their belongings, that sets M. Dyer &#038; Sons approach to customer service apart from other players in the industry.
	With four decades of experience, M. Dyer &#038; Sons has learned how to cope with the stresses of moving incurred to clients, at times offering not just their core services but also empathy and a heart that understands their customer’s situation.

Beyond the needs of their customers, M. Dyer endeavors to provide a thriving work environment to their employees, and fulfill a double bottom line philosophy through proactive community involvement.  Rebecca’s leadership protracts the company’s deeply ingrained sense of charity.
	M. Dyer &#038; Sons believes in promoting from within.  In fact, all of their upper management staff has climbed from the lowest to the highest rung of their corporate ladder.  This philosophy, Rebecca says, provides a better quality base and a clear vantage point to look at their customers’ needs.
	“We believe in having a working family and I say that to all new hires that come on with us, ‘Welcome to the M. Dyer &#038; Sons Ohana’,” Rebecca says.  “And we mean that seriously.”
	Years ago, the Dyers developed a succession plan, which eventually resulted to the sale of the company to its employees.  Today, the company has approximately 60 employee owners – a unique concept, according to Rebecca, that drives up quality immensely.
	Listen to this interview and find out more about one of the most progressive moving firms in Hawaii and the Pacific, and its leader who relentlessly endeavor to serve the community through business and charity.
	BIO:
Rebecca L.M. Parker
	Executive Profile
	Rebecca Parker was promoted to President and CEO of M. Dyer &#038; Sons, Inc. in 2000.  She began her career with M. Dyer as the in house Accountant in 1986.  M. Dyer &#038; Sons provides quality full service relocation services to corporate clients, private families and the Department of Defense in addition to expanding into file records management beginning in 2001.  Ms. Parker offers more than two decades of transportation experience with a focus of increasing market share by improving brand awareness in addition to challenging employees to exceed client expectations by focusing on quality, and the expansion beyond the core business.  She has promoted employees from within the company as well as focusing on community involvement with a concern for our island environment.
	Beginning her career in trucking, Rebecca developed an interest in the transportation industry which began in the accounting department but expanded to human resources, sales, risk management, logistics and customer service areas.  With her guidance, M. Dyer acquired and developed a freight forwarding subsidiary and a records management division.  Overall company revenue has doubled in the past six years.
	In 1996, Medford and Masu Dyer after 30 years in business sold 100% of the company stock to the employees in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  The success over the past ten years is the result of educating the employees to the value of employee ownership.  We instill a sense of pride in providing quality service and pleasing clients which results in an increase in their employee stock value as well as pride in company ownership.  The employees of M. Dyer are moving the memories of the relocating family and this takes considerable care and attention to detail.
	We have implemented a number of employee awards to improve productivity, safety and quality service.  Each client has an opportunity and is encouraged to rate their service experience with M. Dyer &#038; Sons.  The crews with the highest quality score, receive a bonus.  The 2006 survey results reflect a 94% customer service index as superior.  As a family moves because of a major life change such as a new job, death, retirement, divorce or birth, the family is already dealing with many personal issues.  We train our employees to communicate with care and sensitivity which ultimately reduces the concern and stress associated with the relocation process for the family members.  In addition, all employees are on a safety team with quarterly training which has significantly improved our accident frequency and morale.  There is a safety bonus program that rewards the teams and all employees as we remain accident free.
	Ms. Parker also implemented a community involvement program.  Most employee owners are serving as scouting leaders, baseball, cheerleading and soccer coaches, and serving with many community non profit associations such as Goodwill, Hawaii Foodbank, Boy’s and Girl’s Club, American Cancer Society, PTA, donating time at homeless shelters, food drives and in church groups.  Employees are given time off to serve in the community.  We match all employee pledges to Aloha United Way.  We have a number of employees serving our country in the Hawaii National Guard.  The management team at M. Dyer strongly supports community participation and serves on many industry Boards.
	Throughout her career, Rebecca developed experience in logistics, client and employee relations, marketing as well as team building and leadership, technology implementation and operations management.
	Rebecca studied business and accounting at the University of California at Santa Barbara.  She has resided in Hawaii since 1979.

        <itunes:summary>	Sanford Murata makes productive and philanthropic use of his 41 years in the real estate industry.  He wants to pass on the knowledge and experience he has gained over the years by acting as a bridge to the disadvantaged, providing them opportunities that they may otherwise not receive from anywhere else.  
	As president and chief executive officer of Sanford Murata Inc., Sanford has learned to engrain a social value philosophy in his company’s business activities.

“What we’re doing is looking for ways in which we can serve the community, so the real estate projects that we take on has to have some kind of a community benefit – what I call ‘social value’,” Sanford claims.  “So we look for social value in a number of projects that we’re doing now that have that social value component to it.”
	In this Greater Good exclusive, Sanford talks about relationship and his belief in that relationships are created with the sincerity and values that one foregrounds.  
	“It’s not so much a conscious effort to build a relationship, it’s the way you lead your life,” he says.  “You lead your life based on your values and if you’re sincere about those values, the relationships will come about and it will grow.”
	Surely, you will learn a lot as you listen to a man who has been there, done that.  Find out all these and more only on Greater Good.

        <itunes:summary>	Tim Dick has co-founded not only some of the world’s top web companies but also a number of web-based initiatives veered towards uplifting the community and caring for the environment.  His various programs – TRUSTe.org, UseHalf.com, and Grassroots.org – have made huge and lasting impact on a broad scope of society.
	His sense of triple bottom line execution of business activities stems from parental didactics, which he believes has been a significant factor in his proclivity towards reaching out.

“The notion of social responsibility is something that I think you wind up sort of absorbing as a young person,” Tim says.
	Tim has expressed enthusiasm about the changing face of doing business in Hawaii and around the world.  He said that businesses engaging in social responsibility are broadening.
	“There are entrepreneurs and very successful business people who don’t participate that much in social responsibility although I think that’s beginning to change,” he said.  “I think it’s really broadening very significantly and the trends that you guys are looking at really is an exploding trend – that has made me very happy.”  
	With the launch of Hawaii Superferry, Tim has once again influenced society, this time in the realm of sea travel between Hawaii’s islands.

        <itunes:summary>	Five years ago, Keli’i Akina and his wife, Patty, recognized the need to open brighter prospects for young people who would become Hawaii’s future leaders.   In 2002, the couple founded the Center for Tomorrow’s Leaders to help identify some of the top future leaders and give them the best available training that they could get.
	Keli’i believes that most social problems can be alleviated through leadership.  And this has been his mission – to hone the skills and capabilities of the youth to become effective administrators of the community.

“If you take a look at all the problems that society is facing, the answer is always leadership,” Keli’i said.  “Sometimes the cause of the problem is leadership – but the solution to our problems is leadership.”  
	“We see a desperate need for leaders who are founded on character, who have confidence, and who care about the islands,” he added.
	In this Greater Good Radio interview, Keli’i talks about Hawaii Youth For Christ and his pet project, the Center For Tomorrow’s Leaders, and how the latter is fast becoming a source of pride for many of Hawaii’s people.  
	Listen now and find out more about Keli’i’s mission to uplift the community through the education and mentorship of tomorrow’s leaders. 
	BIO:
Ministry and Professional Background
	Keli’i Akina is president and C.E.O. of Youth for Christ Hawaii, the largest and longest running inter-denominational Christian youth ministry in the state of Hawaii.  Keli’i oversees the four core organizations in YFC Hawaii, which are: (1) Campus Life – the largest extra-curricular club movement in local high schools; (2) Fellowship of Christian Athletes – a national brand outreach to athletes and coaches; (3) Center for Tomorrow’s Leaders – one of the premiere youth leadership development organizations in the country; and (4) YFC for Parents – a ministry which provides resources and conferences to equip parents to raise their teenagers.  For nearly 27 years, Keli’i has served in nearly every capacity in Youth for Christ Hawaii and has represented the organization on a national level.
	Keli’i served as volunteer Chairman and C.E.O. of the Jesus Hawaii Project, an historic inter-denominational coalition of churches in Hawaii, for which he led a successful $1.7 million fund-raising effort immediately following the tragic events of September 11, 2001.  Additionally, he directed the uniting of 191 churches in the work of the Jesus Hawaii Project, which mailed nearly a half million copies of the award winning Jesus Video to virtually every residential mailbox in the state.
	In 2002, Keli’i was appointed to the Pacific Century Fellows, a leading public and business leadership program in Hawaii, based upon the White House Fellows program.  Keli’i preaches often in churches and at conferences locally and outside of Hawaii.  He also does consultation and public speaking in the areas of leadership, motivation, and management, for which he draws upon his training as a Certified Human Behavior Consultant from the Leadership Institute of America and Certified Facilitator from the Chemical Awareness Training Institute.  In 2003, Keli’i completed training with the Gallup Organization to become a StrengthsQuest Facilitator, enabling him to provide state of the art consultation in the area of helping leaders and organizations discover and develop their talents.  In 1996, the Hawaii State Legislature’s House of Representatives passed a resolution recognizing Keli’i for “…unselfish commitment of leadership, involvement, and effort” in the cause of serving the community.
	Academic Background
	Keli’i is currently on the faculty of Hawaii Pacific University as an adjunct professor of Humanities and Philosophy.  He has also taught philosophy at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  Keli’i graduated from the Kamehameha Schools and holds degrees in the History and Literature of Religions and in Philosophy from Northwestern University and the University of Hawaii.  He earned the Masters Degree in Comparative East-West Philosophy at the U.H. with the award of “distinction” for his thesis entitled: “Classical Confucianism as a Resource for a Chinese Approach to Human Rights in an East-West Context.” He is currently completing his Ph.D. in philosophy at the U.H.  Recently, Keli’i has lectured on Confucianism and political issues at the East-West Center Fellows Educational Program and was a panelist in the 2003 Shunzo Sakamaki Extraordinary Lecture event sponsored by the U.H. Outreach College.  Keli’i also recently lectured on “Asian Philosophy and Sustainable Economic Development in Asia” at the University of Hawaii School of Business Administration.  Keli’i’s extra-curricular academic activities include sponsorship of forums and panels, including “The Great Debate: Does God Exist?” which drew 1,147 attendees to the U.H. Campus Center Ballroom.
	Personal Background
	Keli’i and Patty live in Honolulu and have four children.  Keli’i has served as an elder and Sunday School teacher at Leeward Community Church of the Christian and Missionary Alliance.  He is also an active member and patron of the Honolulu Academy of Arts, The Contemporary Museum, and other cultural institutions.  When visiting major cities, Keli’i loves to explore art and science museums, explore used book stores and take in concerts and plays.

	BIO:
Marsha Nadalin
	1971-1973    I worked at different jobs trying to figure out what I wanted to do; ice cream parlor,
Bank of America, should I do what the rest of my family does and be in banking, restaurants, and took a lot of art classes at Palomar College in Palomar, California.
	1973-1975	Marinello Beauty College-Learned the skills to become a California Licensed Cosmetologist.
	1975-1979     Mitch and Co Haircutters-Worked as an assistant to the owner Mitch, and was given my own
                       Styling chair soon after and started building my own clientele.
	1979-1980	Traveled for a year with my best friend Mary Hildebrandt.  We went to Fiji Islands, New
Zealand, Australia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.  We had an unbelievable experience.
	1980-1982	Hawaii was the last stop of our travels where I met up with my sweetheart from California, Steven Nadalin.  I worked at International Haircutters in Koko Marina Shopping Center as a hairstylist.  The shop was relocated in the same shopping center and renamed Sean Thomas Salon.
	1982-1984	Sean Thomas Salon- I was given the opportunity to earn 20% of the salon by managing and overseeing the business for the owner Sean Giannetti.  This was a great chance for me to begin attaining skills to further my career as a possible salon owner myself one day.  In 1984 the salon was sold and renamed again to Ambiance Salon.  As a result I received my 20% payment and used the money for a downpayment on a townhouse in Hawaii Kai.  What a break!
	1984-1993	Ambiance Salon-  I worked for the new owners as a hairstylist and became the top in the
                       salon.
	1993-2006      Marsha Nadalin Salon-  I had another opportunity knock when the Percy Ansai, owner of
                       Susan Thomas Salon, in Kahala Mall called me out of the blue to offer to sell me the salon.
                       She had heard of me and my good reputation in the industry, and wanted to sell the business
                       to someone in the beauty industry that cared and had passion for it.  We came to an
                       agreement and I became the proud owner of Marsha Nadalin Salon.  In 1995 we remodeled
                       the salon to give it an up to date look, attracting female and male clients.  In 1998 we
                       expanded adding a spa where we offer facials, nails and massages.  In 2000 we opened the
                       Marsha Nadalin’s Aveda Experiencing Center in the Kahala Mall between Macy’s and
                       Long’s Drugs.  In 2004 we opened the Annex Marsha Nadalin across from Marsha Nadalin
                       Salon and Spa, where we added 6 more hairstyling chairs.

        <itunes:summary>	Being a university administrator is a daunting task; one has to deal with the academic programs offered to thousands of students, and also, manage hundreds of staff and faculty members.

	As a professional, Gene has worked in the administrative post of several of the United States’ top universities including Stanford, Columbia, and University of California – Irvine for more than two decades.  In 2005, he returned to Hawaii to share his expertise in running huge institutions.
Gene has held on to such cumbersome career for he believes in the value of his work.
	“For an educator, there’s not better feeling than to have a student who has had a tough time and come through it and achieve success,” Gene says.
	Gene Awakuni stars in this Greater Good Radio interview with his thoughts on overcoming the greatest challenge – one’s self.  Listen and find out more.

        <itunes:summary>	No employees, no plan, and no money – these were the challenges that attracted Bob Dove to run the state’s largest writer of workers&#8217; compensation insurance.  Under Bob’s leadership, Hawaii Employers’ Mutual Insurance Company, Inc. (HEMIC) was able to sign 292 policies amounting to $1.3 million in premiums, within its first month operation.
	HEMIC is a high quality, competitive insurance company that is today’s leader in Hawaii&#8217;s workers&#8217; compensation insurance industry.

Bob’s career in the insurance business spans 30 years.  This includes a four-year tenure in various senior management positions at the Texas Workers’ Compensation Insurance Fund, now operating as Texas Mutual.  
	In this Greater Good Radio exclusive, Bob talks about fitting in to the Hawaii community, or in any place for that matter.  According to Bob, it is the state of mind that separates successful assimilation to a culture.  
	“I think when you come in to a new situation, you can come in with the attitude that you’re going to find things that are familiar to you and the things that you like,” Bob said.  “Or you can come in with the attitude that, ‘I’m going to find everything that’s different and everything that I don’t like’.”
	“If you want to fit in to an environment, you can do it,” he added.  “Some place you have to work a little harder than others, but you can fit in.”

        <itunes:summary>	Stanford Carr has tilled the land from a very young age and gathered much knowledge as a vernal farmer.  This early childhood experience would eventually reflect on his professional career as one of the most innovative and dynamic real estate developers in the state.  
	Today, Stanford is president of Stanford Carr Development, an acknowledged leader in the Hawaii land development industry.  Stanford has founded the company in 1990 and has since changed the Hawaii landscape with his master-planned communities.

By early 2007, Stanford Carr Development would have completed over 3,000 homes with more than 1,000 new homes in development or under construction.  
	Stanford shares in this interview his story about growing up in Kula and learning about the basics of farming through neighbors.  
	At the age of 11, Stanford&#8217;s mother bought eight acres of farmland next to Kula Elementary School, where he met a neighbor named Herbert Kogan.  Kogan would stand as his guide and mentor, and sponsored him to start a farm on their property.  Stanford went everyday after school, and on weekends, to learn the ways of farming.  In return, he would help out his neighbor and other farmers with their needs, displaying a true sense of Aloha in this sleepy part of the islands.

	BIO:
Stanford S. Carr
President
Stanford Carr Development
	Born and raised on the island of Maui, Stanford Carr grew up surrounded by family and friends involved in every aspect of construction and development. In this environment, Carr sharpened his skills and developed his vision of island communities inspired by the cultural diversity and physical beauty of Hawai`i.  Now, thirty years later, Stanford Carr’s passion for excellence in architectural design and quality can be found throughout the islands.
	Since it was founded in Honolulu in 1990, Stanford Carr Development has become an acknowledged industry leader in creating distinctive and successful communities through innovative site planning, diversity in architectural design and product types, environmental sensitivity, and the use of cutting-edge technology and building materials. By early 2007, Stanford Carr Development will have completed over 3,000 homes with more than 1,000 new homes in development or under construction.  Stanford Carr is one of the most dynamic real estate developers in Hawai`i today.
	Stanford Carr has consistently delivered award-winning homes to the island communities of Oahu, Maui and the Big Island garnering 11 Western National awards and 46 local BIA awards.  On his island home of Maui, Carr’s very first development, included Pukalani Fairway Estates, won “Best in Show - Neighbor Islands” in the 1992 Building Industry Association Parade of Homes.  Most recently his Kulalani at Mauna Lani on the Big Island won “Best in Show - Neighbor Islands” in the 2006 Parade of Homes.  Carr attributes his developed eye and appreciation for the choreography of design with arts, architecture and interiors to his mother.
	Best known for The Peninsula at Hawaii Kai and Colony at the Peninsula on Oahu, Waikoloa Colony Villas, Kahakai Estates, and The Fairways at Mauna Lani on the Big Island, and the master planned community of Kehalani and Wailea Fairway Villas on Maui, Carr’s quality communities are reflective of a complete and thoughtful approach to the lifestyles of future residents and the homes they are looking for.
	Always mindful of the needs of the community as well as the real estate market, Carr’s master-planned communities include residential and commercial components as well as community parks and recreation areas.  Over ten years ago, Carr created a unique opportunity for Oahu residents looking for more affordable housing with his award-winning communities of Kekuilani, Village 4 and Iwalani, Village 5 at Kapolei.  These new and well-designed homes offered modern amenities and charming character at affordable prices.
	Giving back to the community is a core value of Carr’s corporate philosophy.  Currently he is involved as trustee of the University of Hawaii Foundation and has been reappointed to an additional nine-year term.   He also sits on the Board of Directors for Enterprise Honolulu, Hawaii Theatre for Youth and Youth at Risk.  Carr is also a member of the Building Industry Association of Hawaii and is actively involved in developing the new BIA Training Center.  In the past, Carr served on the Political Action Committee Trustee-Government Affairs Committee, as a director of the Hawaii Developer’s Council and as a member of the Governor’s Advisory Board for the Department of Hawaii Homeland.

        <itunes:summary>	“Every one has to work together to find solutions to problems that degrade the commons,” says Von Hernandez.    
	This is one of the missions that he and Greenpeace, where he has worked for more than 14 years, have undertaken—inculcating environmental consciousness to the community through social value awareness and   preaching individual responsibility in protecting Mother Nature.
	Von, who is now executive director of Greenpeace Southeast Asia, tirelessly promotes and advocates environmental protection.  His eye opener, or what he claims as “his baptism of fire”, was the 1991 Ormoc tragedy in Leyte province, where more than 8000 lives have perished due to flooding from the abnormal rainfall and landslides brought about by deforestation.
	Then a Green Coalition volunteer, he traveled to the province to participate in relief efforts.  After seeing the harrows and despair of the victims, Von vowed to take a step further and become a stauncher ally of the environment.

In this Greater Good Philippines interview, Von Hernandez talks about how he has become a volunteer for the environment and how his family, children especially, play their roles in pushing him further particularly in turbulent and challenging times.  Von also mentions having hope despite all the bleak signs.
	“This is the important message, our forecast is bleak but after the heavy rain, out comes the sunshine.”  
	All these and more only on Greater Good Philippines.  Click here to listen to the interview.
	Jay-R Patron:  What does being executive director for Greenpeace entail?  What do you do for Greenpeace Southeast Asia?
	Von Hernandez:  I just started as executive director for Greenpeace Southeast Asia last March, although I’ve been around.  I’ve been with Greenpeace Southeast Asia for years now, serving in various capacities, the last one being director of campaigns.  Greenpeace Southeast Asia is one of the national and regional offices of Greenpeace worldwide.  We have presence in 41 countries.  We have 29 national and regional offices.  Southeast Asia is one of the, what we call, regional offices.  Comprising the regional entity would be our operations in the Philippines, our operations in Thailand, and also Indonesia.  As executive director for a regional entity, I am overall and ultimately responsible for the viability of our operations.  By viability I mean the success of our campaigns, and also our financial self-sufficiency, to be able to operate and run better campaigns.  In the region we are running four major campaigns.  Most of them are also global in nature.  For example, planet and energy campaigns are priority campaigns.  We are on board the Rainbow Warrior now.  The ship is here in Manila, testament to this ongoing campaign that we are having in the region; dirty energy, exposing the problems with fossil fuel, and promoting the shift to renewable and clean energy.  That’s our priority campaign.  We also run our forest campaign in Indonesia, which has the highest rate of deforestation in the world today.  That’s also contributing to global warming.  In Thailand and the Philippines, we run what we call the Clean Water campaign.  This is a project of our toxic campaign against pollution, promoting clean production and industry.  We also run a campaign against genetically modified organisms.  In a way, this is the content of what we do in this region.  While we have actual presence in this three countries, our premise covers the whole Southeast Asia, places like Vietnam, Cambodia, where we should be able to protect our campaigning when the need arises.  As chief executive officer of our operations in Southeast Asia, I have to be able to juggle my self in between these three countries that also compete in priorities, at the same time, serve the interest of our campaigns, serve the interest of our fun-raising operations, our public outreach programs, as well as our supporters.  In the region, we have about 30…well not 30…at the moment it’s running between 22 to 25 thousand supporters in the region.
	Jay-r Patron:  How long have you been with Greenpeace?
	Von Hernandez:  I’ve been with Greenpeace close to 14 years now.  Before I joined Greenpeace, I was already in the environmental business in the Philippines.  I’ve led various campaigns before I joined Greenpeace.  I led a campaign against commercial logging in the country.  I joined Greenpeace in ’95 as part of a crusade we had then against the practice of dumping hazardous wastes from OECD or industrialized countries to poor nations.  I was one of the first Greenpeace campaigners in Asia before we even had the actual offices in this region.  My first project involved documenting and exposing this hazardous waste trend that was taking place.  The industrialized countries are taking advantage of the lack of environmental standards, the lack of controls, the lack of enforcement, in poor countries to justify that kind of thing using economic guises of recycling.  We were able to expose that, in fact, as a result of our campaigning, the international community decided to prohibit this practice and that culminated in agreement called the Battle Plan or as part of the Battle Plan.
	Jay-R Patron:  Where did you get that passion for environmental protection?
	Von Hernandez:  I have been often asked this question.  If you look at my history, my background, I started as a teacher.  I started assisting in college in the university and I was teaching Philippine Arts and Literature in the University of the Philippines before I got sucked into environmental work.  At that time,  I was doing a lot of volunteer work for this health relief organization that’s called “Kapwa Ko Mahal Ko”.  It’s no longer around but that that time it was one of the more active health charity organizations.  They were doing medical clinics and relief work for communities.  I was also helping out in the operations of another group called the Green Coalition, which was then involved in environmental policy.  I was dabbling on environmental issues until 1991 when disaster struck this central Philippine island, Leyte.  It’s called the Ormoc tragedy.  
	Jay-R Patron:  The flooding.
	Von Hernandez:  The flooding, where more than 8000 people perished.  But there was also this massive flashflood coming from the mountain that was because of the abnormal rainfall.  And this is the culmination of years of logging and mindless conversion of forest lands into agricultural lands in that area.  “Kawpa Ko Mahal Ko” sent a relief and rehabilitation team to Ormoc and I was part of that team.  That really, to me, was my baptism of fire.  It opened my eyes about the nature of environmental threats that people have been saying that, in fact, they’re emphasizing that the nature of the environment has become very much a survival issue especially for Filipinos living in these frontiers.  At that time, I decided to take my goals for the environment more seriously.  I left my teaching career in the university and started working full-time for environmental issues.  So I joined the Green Coalition.  I also initiated a number of campaigns in the Green Coalition including the community effort to clean up the Pasig River.  I also continued my advocacy against commercial logging, and at that time, I managed to tie up with international groups including Greenpeace, who have been doing these campaigns.  That’s how I go even more involved.  I’ve never stopped since.
	Jay-R Patron:  How important is your family’s role in shaping what you are as a person?
	Von Hernandez:  First of all, the kind of work, in my case especially…I have to constantly move around, I have to—in certain circumstances—I have to face risks also, for my safety.  Just being away from them, I have three kids and they’re all growing up, you need to have a very supportive family to be able to continue this kind of work.  At the same time, I draw my inspiration from my family from my children.  Whenever I see injustice, whenever I see environmental abuse I know that what to take care are issues of our children, the future, of our society and our nation.  So I think about them and to me that fuels my inspiration to continue doing the work that I do.
	Jay-R Patron:  As a person, what do you do to contribute to the minimization of your carbon footprint?
	Von Hernandez:  Carbon footprint.  As you know, we all have our contradictions.  In my case, it’s so difficult.  It’s really a challenge.  I ran a regional office.  I have to be constantly moving so the flying around, of course, I’m guilty of that.  But at the same time, you know that you have to do it otherwise the work will suffer.  I try to think about it as the work is actually helping create that change needed for industries for individuals, first of all, conscious about their contributions, their carbon footprint and we need to lower them.  Of course, we need to practice what we preach in terms of energy efficiency, in terms of waste management, in terms…simple things; unplugging, switching off.
	Jay-R Patron:  In your career, what has been the greatest challenge that you’ve had to overcome and how did you overcome it?
	Von Hernandez:  The greatest challenge.  There are so many challenges.  I initiated a campaign in the… around late 90s on dirty technologies including incineration and waste management.  Metro Manila constantly suffers from the problem, even now.  You see that the problem is still there, pretty much.  I had to campaign against a proposed solution.  They were proposing incineration as a way out of this crisis.  So I initiated that campaign.  Incineration will not make that problem disappear rather, it will convert the problem, the pollution problem, much more difficult to solve or deal with.  So we had to campaign against this proposal and that campaign brought me in confrontation with business interests, brought me in confrontation with government officials, and also foreign governments, against chamber of commerce, all the mainstream established interest who were promoting this kind of solution to the problem.  On the other hand, I had to work with communities, I had to work with local groups and others, to put together this coalition against the migration to dirty technologies.  We won that campaign, but not without fears for my well-being.  I’ve received a lot of intimidation as part of that campaign.  And we won that campaign, and that culminated in to the passage of the Clean Air Act in 99-2000.  
	Jay-R Patron:  What is the most important lesson that you’ve learned in your career that you still keep to this day?
	Von Hernandez:  One of my mantras in life is to always excel, to constantly reinventing your channels.  Once you’ve attained an objective, you don’t stop at them.  You move on but next time, you try to find ways to do it even better.  I’m not afraid to make failures.  I do make failures, I do make mistakes.  I fail in some of my projects but that is how I learn.  I keep reminding myself, so long that I don’t repeat those mistakes, and add value to do work that I do in the future.  That’s one of my mantras, excel and pay forward; not to glorify failure or glorify mistakes but to learn from them.

Jay-R Patron:  As I look at your bio I see a lot of awards.  Out of all those awards, what do you see as the most valuable?
	Von Hernandez:  The awards they’re just recognitions of the work that you’ve done.  Let me put it this way, in all my work as an environmentalist, I’ve seen…I’ve worked with communities, all levels… and I would say the most rewarding is seeing change in different levels, the community level, when you are being able to empower communities to resist an incinerator, a landfill for example, being proposed in their area and actually being able to do it.  To me, that is validating those types of local victory, and then putting that together, working with other groups, promoting a different policy makes it even more lasting.  The fact that we won the Clean Air Act and the Ecological Wasteland Act would be proof of how we are changing mindsets, this time involving decision-makers, policy-makers.  The greatest validation for me is seeing how people are shifting their mindsets away from dirty practices.  Before when you talk to a local official, at the barangay level, maybe even a man on the street, and you ask how to deal with waste, the automatic answer would be to bury or burn, right?  In fact you still see these episodes happening in our daily lives; burning garbage in the streets, backyard burning.  But now, there is greater awareness that there is another way.  Not many people… a lot of people still have to practice it but they know that burning is bad.  They know the right set of response, which include segregation and composting.  I talked to local government officials, and the fact that it’s already an embedded policy, they know that that is the first thing that they have to do.  To me that is very gratifying, that we are and I have witnessing a mind shift.  Global warming and even the greater threat of ecosystems collapse, the more urgent our mind shift becomes… the awards are just awards.  At the end of the day they’re just recognitions for the good effort but what is truly awarding is being part of the shifting paradigm and being able to catalyze that somehow.
	Jay-R Patron:  Considering what you’ve just said, would you consider that as your greatest accomplishment?  If not, what is your greatest life accomplishment so far?
	Von Hernandez:  So far?  I haven’t really… because to me the work continues.  But anyway, I would consider my greatest life accomplishment is seeing this paradigm shift actually taking place.  In fact, one of the things that I’m really aiming for at the moment is I want to see in my lifetime governments really taking action and moving away from dirty fossil fuels towards the next… solar generation, shifting us from dirty fuel to a renewable, clean energy.  I want to see the current leadership transform the interest of the future and this is what’s driving me now.  And when I talk about climate impact, environmental impact, I often think about my children, that in fact, we are no longer talking about their children, but it is this generation of young children and young adults alike who will now suffer from the brunt of climate change if we don’t do anything.  So that drives me.  I want to see, while we have a narrow window of action, I want to see that change actually take place.  I’ve seen that change happen.  In my work in other, on waste for example, in incineration, I’ve seen that change happen and it’s still happening.  If you look at communities around the country, we have 40 thousand barangays.  Maybe if you do a survey, how many of these barangays are actually doing ecological waste management?  Maybe less than 10 percent.  I did that survey five years ago, it was about five percent.  I know that level of compliance is increasing.  More and more dumpsites are being shut down and more and more communities are demonstrating the priority of this approach beginning with cross-segregation; material recovery rather than material destruction.  So there is a change of mindset in terms of thinking about how we should approach and use our resources.  While the problem still persists, we still see garbage in the streets, we know the days of dirty practice are dwindling, and that we are moving towards a cleaner… it will take time but I have no doubt that we are moving towards the right direction.
	Jay-r Patron:  It seems that what you do is not just for the environment but also for the community.  Why do you think it is important for Filipinos to give back to their community and do their part in the conservation and preservation of environmental resources?
	Von Hernandez:  Come to think of it, the environment is really the base of all kinds of human activities.  Without a clean environment, we actually don’t have base for economic development.  At the end of the day, you may have good economic growth rate but you cannot make money.  If all the water is dirty, all the air is polluted, life would not be possible.  So, the environment is also the context within which all other human activities take place.  Our relationships, work, employment, industry, all these happen in the context of… so it is important that that connection is established and that connection is actually acknowledged.  We are constantly fighting for giving preferential treatment for environmental issues.  It’s one of those things; we campaign on specific issues but at the same time we are pushing for (24:13) to be recognized, the role of environmental and human economic development.  What was the question again?
	Jay-R Patron:  Why is it important for Filipinos, our countrymen, to give back to the community, pay it forward, for the community and for the environment?
	Von Hernandez:  For the community, we have to look out for each other.  We have to look out for the interest not only of yourself, your family, you have to… when you talk about resources, these are shared resources we are talking about; water, river, the fish, food coming from the forest, these are shared resources.  I don’t think it’s right that some people benefit from the exploitation of those resources at the expense of others.  Companies and even individuals pollute the river, in a way they are violating the rights of others.  That cannot continue.  Everyone has a right to a clean environment.  Every one has a right to live in a safe and healthy environment.  On the other hand, there is nothing in our laws that give companies and abusive industries the right to take away our resources.  So we start with this concept of human rights and concept of environmental (25:58) to define the basic rights.  So protecting the global commons should be a community undertaking, protecting the commons.  Everyone benefits from the commons, therefore, everyone has to work together to find solutions to problems that degrade the commons.
	Jay-R Patron:  If there was one message out of what is discussed this morning that you would like to tell our listeners or our readers, what would that message be?
	Von Hernandez:  I think the message can be summed up with one word, which is hope.  We see that the signs are really bleak, if we look at the global reports, the narrative coming from the scientific process on climate change, that narrative is telling us that we have practically a hundred months to act, take drastic measures to reverse this climate change, 100 months.  People can just easily say, “Let’s give up.  What’s the point?  We’ll all die.”  The other day, I was visiting this dumpsite, Smokey Mountain dumpsite, and the problem is still persisting. That gets to me.  You’re campaigning and you still see, by and large the problem still remains.  Easily one can give up.  At the same time, I see communities taking initiative and I see for example, local governments moving to clean energy.  We were in Legazpi just the other week, and the governor issued a statement saying that the province will not support coal.  I see in this initiative, even at that local level, I see that that is where hope lies.  That is where change will happen.  People are slowly taking the initiative to make our democratic institutions work for a greener future.  This is the important message, our forecast is bleak but after the heavy rain, out comes the sunshine.  If you’ve seen what I’ve seen, the environmental destruction, abuse, you want to just give up and lose all kinds of hope.  One drives my anger, the other inspires me.
	Jay-R Patron:  What can we expect from you and Greenpeace Southeast Asia in the coming days, weeks, months, years?
	Von Hernandez:  The most urgent in our view, that’s why we have the Rainbow Warrior here in the Philippines, we are pushing for the passage of the Renewable Energy law, to catalyze this shift away from dirty fossil fuel and towards clean energy.  That law has been stalled in congress, it’s been pending, it’s been languishing in the House of congress for many years now and we hope our campaign push and momentum generated by this visit will help push that education finally.   We are confident that we can get that passed and we’d also like to stop all this new proposals of dirty coal power stations.  I think there are nine being lined up.  That flies in the face of government rhetoric on climate change.  One the one hand, we are one of the most battered nations in terms of extreme weather.  The Albay, Bicol region is in fact the hottest hot spots in the world when it comes to climate impact.  So exposing that hypocrisy on the part of the government, at the same time, saying yes to solutions promoting… providing them with the critical map and way forward to make that shift.  That is what we are looking at in the immediate term.  On the longer term, we are looking at how we will be able to move away from this fixation on development.  When I talk about development, it’s not like we are anti-progress, but the kind of development path that is taken by Asian countries including the Philippines, unfortunately it is a dirty development path that will lead us to ecological ruin.  We are sacrificing our security.  So we want to move away from this dirty development model.  In the case of the Philippines, leap frogging over dirty technologies, leap frogging over the mistakes of the West.  We cannot follow that development path.  If we follow the development path of Europe or America, I don’t think the planet will be able to sustain that.  
	Jay-R Patron:  Just like India and China.
	Von Hernandez:  Just like India and China, that’s impossible.  We probably need six more planets just to be able to sustain this massive need for resources.  So we need to be able to leap frog over those mistakes and immediately make the shift.  I think in the long term, it is going to be much better for our society.  If government’s today invest in dirty fossil fuel, that traps us in to maybe another 25 years of dirty energy, that cycle, dirty energy and climate change.  It’s hard to get away from that.  But if we make the shift now, then we anticipate that that is the right direction for the future.  I’m very excited about how we actually push our government, our decision-makers in making that change.  I don’t think our nation can afford another, maybe a decade of vacillating short-sighted leadership.  That’s why it is important that we continually apply the pressure.  Even communities can send that message to decision-makers.  The thing is many of the events happening in this country.  Many of the decisions being made for our sake are decisions being made in closed doors and the community and the people are always the last to know.  We must resist it and make sure that we also participate in shaping the narrative of our society.

        <itunes:summary>	At a young age of 21, Shelley Wilson decided to start her business, Wilson Homecare.  She was recognized in 2003 by Pacific Business News as one of Hawaii’s 40 Under Forty, and was one of the fastest 50 companies two years in a row.  Her company was also recognized in Forbes Magazine with an outstanding small business award.  She’s actively involved with different business community organizations such as the Chamber of Commerce and the Healthcare Association of Hawaii to name a few.  And she also provides international support to aid underprivileged children in Africa and Vietnam.
	Shelley Wilson came to Hawaii from the frigid weather of Iowa to ameliorate from an accident incurred from her military duty.  Incapacitated for several years, Shelley was admitted to the Tripler Army Medical Center where she awaited full-recovery.  Her humbling experience with her friends and medical staff during her convalescence galvanized her to stay in Hawaii and put up her own business veered towards care for the sick and injured.

But the beginning stage of her entrepreneurial endeavor is not without its share of trials and tribulations.  For many years, Shelley worked without pay, getting by through several jobs to keep her business alive.  Thanks to a number of individuals who believed in her mission, Wilson Homecare survived to become one of the State’s most outstanding small businesses.  
	In this interview, Shelley Wilson talks about relationships and the value of developing and maintaining good rapport with people sharing the same goals and values.  
	“There are certain people that show up in your life that believe in what you’re doing and they have the same visions, the same passion, or they see it in you and they’re willing to help out along the way,” she says.
	Find out more about Shelley Wilson’s truly inspiring story, only here on Greater Good Radio.
	BIO:
SHELLEY WILSON
FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, WILSON HOMECARE
	Inspired by her own personal experience with the need for quality and compassionate homecare, Shelley Wilson opened Wilson Homecare in 1996.  She has guided its growth into one of the state’s most successful private homecare agencies, with more than 200 employees providing personal home healthcare services in residences across O‘ahu.
	The story of Shelley and WHC is one of resilience, can-do entrepreneurial spirit and service to our community. During her career in the military as an Army medic, a severe car accident left Shelley with multiple broken bones and injuries. While in recovery she realized how beneficial it would have been to have had homecare services, which unfortunately were not available in her area. Years later, after moving to Hawaii and working in the healthcare field, she was motivated to start her own business providing quality homecare services at affordable prices. As a disabled veteran, Wilson was able to use her military leadership skills to create a top-flight team of highly competent and compassionate caregivers able to provide clients with premium home healthcare services.
	Since establishing the agency, Shelley’s management skills have earned her a number of awards, including Pacific Business News’ “40 under Forty” and Wilson Homecare has twice been named one of the newspaper’s “Fastest 50” companies.
	Wilson is also active in the business community, serving as a board member for The Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii and is the incoming chair of its Health Issues Committee, board member of the Hawaii Society of Corporate Planners and is the 2007 president-elect for the local chapter board of the Organization of Women Leaders. Shelley is also a member of the Healthcare Association of Hawaii, National Organization of Female Executives, National Association of Homecare and the Better Business Bureau of Hawaii. 
	Between devoting the majority of her time to her business and community organizations, Wilson also provides international support to aid underprivileged children. She traveled to Africa with Rotary International to help vaccinate children for polio eradication and spent one month in Vietnam with the “Kids Without Borders” humanitarian group.  Shelley has touched the lives of hundreds of individuals, from needy children in foreign countries to local families here in Hawaii.

        <itunes:summary>	Admiral RJ “Zap” Zlatoper’s work life spans four different careers, a verification of his versatile and well-rounded mindset.  Admiral Zlatoper was a former commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the world’s largest naval command encompassing half the Earth’s surface, and including more than 190 ships, 1600 aircraft, and 200,000 personnel, with an operating budget of $5 billion per year.  
	After a distinguished naval career, he became co-chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc., a banking software company rated 45th on the Forbes magazine list of the 200 best small companies in the U.S.

Admiral Zlatoper has served for over 10 years as the chief executive officer of large organizations in the national defense and commercial sectors.  Today he is a trustee to The Estate of James Campbell, a private trust which administers real estate assets valued at more than $2 billion.
To Admiral Zlatoper, physical and spiritual development is an essential tool needed to become a successful leader.
	He talks about his “management-by-walking” style as corporate head and how showing concern for employees provides motivation and inspiration that can significantly affect performance and output.  
	“I walked around the spaces in some area or another everyday and more or less just stick my head and ask my employees how things are going,” Admiral Zlatoper says.  “After about six moths people realized that it was more than a perfunctory how are things going.  It was “Well I got a little problem here” “Okay do you have all the help that you need or can we help up the other end of the building here.” 
	Admiral Zlatoper shares in this interview his experiences as military figure and corporate chief.  He talks about the value of mentorship and putting trust to one’s peers.  He shares how faith, generally speaking, contributes significantly to one’s struggle over trials and adversities.
	Evan and Kari bring to listeners a great leader, and an even greater advocate of humanity.
	BIO:
Admiral R. J. “Zap” Zlatoper, USN (Ret.)
Trustee
The Estate of James Campbell
	R.J. “Zap” Zlatoper assumed his current position as the 24th Trustee of The Estate of James Campbell on the 1st of July, 2000 after successful earlier careers in the high technology industry and the United States Navy. During his service in the private and public sectors, Admiral Zlatoper has served for over 10 years as the Chief Executive Officer of large organizations in the national defense and commercial sectors.
	The Estate of James Campbell is a private trust which administers real estate assets valued at more than $2 billion, with holdings that span Hawaii and 16 states on the U.S. mainland.   Its largest project to date is the development of the City of Kapolei which is expected to become a major urban center rivaling today’s downtown Honolulu. 
	Prior to joining The Estate of James Campbell, Admiral Zlatoper served as Co-Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Sanchez Computer Associates, Inc., a banking software company rated 45th on the Forbes magazine list of the 200 best small companies in the U.S.  From 1997 through 2000, Admiral Zlatoper was instrumental in the addition of new offices, business associations, and partnerships worldwide, as well as corporate acquisitions, as Sanchez grew from a $50 million market capitalization organization to a $1 billion corporation.  
	Before joining Sanchez, Admiral Zlatoper completed a distinguished naval career.  His final assignment was Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, the world’s largest naval command encompassing half the Earth’s surface, and including more than 190 ships, 1600 aircraft, and 200,000 personnel, with an operating budget of $5 billion per year.  In this command he was directly responsible for naval relations with 45 countries throughout the Asia Pacific rim.  A combat experienced naval aviator with over 4,000 flying hours and 1,000 carrier landings, in addition to numerous operational assignments, he also served as:  the Chief of Naval Personnel; a Battle Group Commander in Desert Storm and Desert Shield; a Carrier Air Wing Commander; the Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense; the U.S. 7th Fleet’s Chief of Staff; an Executive Assistant on the staff of the Secretary of the Navy; and a Program Coordinator for the F/A-18 jet aircraft on the Navy staff in Washington, D.C.
	He has received numerous personal decorations including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal; the Navy Distinguished Service Medal; the Legion of Merit; the Distinguished Flying Cross; the Meritorious Service Medal; the Air Medal; and the Navy Commendation Medal (with Combat “V”); plus various campaign and unit awards.  He is the honored recipient of the Japanese Grand Cordon of the Rising Sun and the Korean Presidential Tong Il medal.
	Throughout his professional career, he has been called regularly to testify before the U.S. Congress.  He has contributed to many Washington “think tank” studies; served as a consultant for several commercial corporations, as well as the Center for Naval Analysis; published articles on management, logistics, and naval strategy; and serves on the advisory boards and boards of directors of five corporations.   He is the honorary Consul General for Slovenia in Hawaii.  
	Admiral Zlatoper’s academic achievements are several.  He holds an Honorary Doctorate in Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a Master’s degree in Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Master’s degree in Administration from the George Washington University, and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from RPI.  He is a distinguished graduate of the Naval War College.  Admiral Zlatoper regularly lectures on leadership, management, and military matters at universities and corporate conferences around the country and overseas.
	Community involvement is very important to Admiral Zlatoper.  He currently is a Trustee for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a Regent for Chaminade University, and a Board of Advisors member of the School of Business &#038; Public Management at the George Washington University.  Admiral Zlatoper serves on the boards of the Pacific Aviation Museum Pearl Harbor; the East-West Center; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Foundation; Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii – Military Affairs Council; Catholic Charities Hawaii; and is a member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society of the United Way.  
	His hobbies include:  reading, competing in triathlons, jogging, swimming, scuba, body boarding, and golf . . . each of which he pursues with enthusiasm, but without great distinction.  A native of Cleveland, Ohio, Admiral Zlatoper and his wife, Barry (formerly Barry Lane Oliver of Virginia Beach, Virginia), have two grown children on the mainland&#8211;Ashley, a medical doctor, and Michael, an advertising executive.

	STORY SUMMARY »
	Ever wondered how Hawaii&#8217;s most successful business leaders rose to the top? You might be surprised by the answers.
	
	About two years ago, Evan and Kari Leong started a radio and television show featuring in-depth personal conversations with notables &#8212; many of whom rarely grant interviews. &#8220;Greater Good Radio,&#8221; along with the television show that adds a visual element to the audio exchange, resonated with so many people that the young husband-and-wife team decided to write a book as part of their ongoing volunteer effort to inspire others to give back to the community.
	They took some of the best transcripts from those interviews and reduced them to several readable paragraphs in sections such as &#8220;What&#8217;s Your Purpose?&#8221; &#8220;Follow Your Passion&#8221; and &#8220;The Importance of Family.&#8221; The result is an inspiring and readable volume &#8212; now available in paperback, just in time to serve as motivation for new graduates.
	FULL STORY »
	By Katherine Nichols
knichols@starbulletin.com
	A sentence in Evan Leong&#8217;s introduction to the book he wrote with his wife, Kari Leong, explains everything about how the print project evolved. &#8220;As it turns out,&#8221; he wrote, &#8220;what was first envisioned as a success-in-business book has become a book on life itself.&#8221; Attending 12 funerals in 2004 helped Evan discover his purpose: &#8220;To inspire as many people as possible and to help them make a positive difference in their lives.&#8221;
	&#8220;The Greater Good: Life Lessons from Hawaii&#8217;s Leaders&#8221; emerged from the well-respected radio and television shows by the same name &#8212; projects the hosts, the Leongs, launched as a public service effort of their own while raising two young children and running their own Bubble Tea Supply Co.
	In the two years since the radio show began, they have invited dozens of prominent Hawaii business leaders to share the personal and professional stories that led to their success. The open, casual discussions usually reveal determination, failures, regrets, inspirational turning points and a commitment to giving back to the community.
	
&#8220;The Greater Good:  Life Lessons from Hawaii&#8217;s Leaders&#8221; by Evan and Kari Leong (Watermark, $24.95 hardcover)
	Paperback edition ($19.95) may be preordered at bookstores and at booklineshawaii.com.
	To hear interviews from the Leong&#8217;s radio show visit www.greatergoodradio.com.

	For the book, Kari and Evan chose 45 of the best half-hour radio/television interviews and reduced each one to several concise, readable paragraphs.
	&#8220;I think people like the book because they can get inspired daily while waiting for someone in their car,&#8221; Evan said of the 207-page volume that&#8217;s easily consumed in short bursts. &#8220;We kind of wrote it the way we would want to read it. And it gives a human perspective to things. A lot of people are getting involved in the community as a result.&#8221;
	Published by Watermark, the book is divided into sections titled &#8220;What&#8217;s Your Purpose?&#8221; &#8220;Follow Your Passion,&#8221; &#8220;Giving Back,&#8221; &#8220;Overcoming Adversity,&#8221; &#8220;Building Relationships,&#8221; &#8220;The Importance of Family&#8221; and &#8220;Undeniable Faith.&#8221; Six or seven community leaders contribute to each chapter with brief essays about their lives and work in an effort to &#8220;provide different perspectives on these themes,&#8221; said Evan. A brief biography of the contributor sits in the corner of each piece.
	

&#8220;The Greater Good&#8221; is illustrated with images of local leaders as children. Top row from left: Dennis Francis, president and publisher, Star-Bulletin and MidWeek; Joan Bennet, president and CEO, Bennet Group Strategic Communications; Stephen B. Metter, CEO, MW Group; Sanford Murata, president, Sanford Murata Inc.; Stephen Ai, president and CEO, City Mill. Bottom row: Crystal K. Rose, partner, Bays, Deaver, Lung, Rose &#038; Holma; Dick Gushman, CEO, DGM Group; Rick Blangiardi, president and general manager, KGMB; Nate Smith, president and CEO, Time Warner Cable.

	A story from John Dean, managing partner of Startup Capital Ventures and former CEO of Silicon Valley Bank, recalled a bank officer, Bob Huffman, who developed ALS, or Lou Gehrig&#8217;s disease, while he and Dean tried to turn around the First National Bank of Oklahoma City, which was &#8220;hemorrhaging losses&#8221; at the time.
	Part of the plan to improve the business involved creating a new set of core values. Everyone wanted to make a commitment to the community and build trust and respect for the employees. But this occurred in a most unexpected way. When Huffman became ill and quickly lost the ability to walk and talk, his fellow employees helped care for him, and the bank arranged for a van to transport Huffman and his wheelchair to work each day.
	&#8220;Seeing Bob day in and day out was an inspiration to many of us at the bank,&#8221; Dean wrote. Ironically, in those two years the bank went from &#8220;a failed institution to the most profitable bank in the state. And I would argue that our commitment to Bob and to all employees is what drove the turnaround.&#8221;
	Nainoa Thompson explored navigating with your heart &#8220;when you can&#8217;t see with your eyes,&#8221; and retired Navy Capt. Jerry Coffee recalled his seven years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. His turnaround occurred when he stopped saying, &#8220;Why me?&#8221; and began asking God to prepare him to be a &#8220;better, stronger, smarter person in every possible way,&#8221; and to use the time &#8212; much of it spent in solitary confinement &#8212; productively.
	An especially moving essay came from U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye. He remembered joining the military as an 18-year-old private in 1943, when people of Japanese descent were finally allowed to serve their country. In understated language he recounted his multiple, severe wounds and the harrowing transport to the medical tent. Doctors had given up on him until a chaplain &#8212; who realized the young Inouye would fight for his life at all costs &#8212; urged the medical team to provide more immediate attention. Inouye received 17 transfusions, barely escaping death.
	In the section about family, Robin Campaniano, president and CEO of AIG Hawaii Insurance Co., explained how missing the opportunity to teach his children to ride bicycles altered his professional choices. &#8220;I canceled my upcoming trip, didn&#8217;t give the speech I had been working on, and shortly thereafter, left my position.&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;If your family life is balanced, everything else will follow.&#8221;
	Indeed, Evan Leong noted that the &#8220;number one regret from the interviewees was not spending enough time with their children when they were young.&#8221;
	Keeping everything in perspective is part of the larger picture for the Leongs. Their primary goal with the Greater Good projects has always focused on assisting social services and nonprofits in a way that transcends their own ability to directly volunteer by igniting in others the passion to help. In addition, they are mobilizing partnerships between corporations, government and nonprofit organizations so each can help the other and, in turn, benefit the community.
	&#8220;All of what we&#8217;re doing now is bringing the community together,&#8221; Evan said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the 21st-century ahupuaa.&#8221;
	They end the book with a simple statement that will resonate with anyone yearning for success and wondering about the path that will lead them there: &#8220;You have the ability to create a better life. Make your life a work of art. Create your life to make a difference.&#8221;

        <itunes:summary>	Women provide the foundation for families, so communities rely on them. This is why the Women&#8217;s Fund of Hawaii, a grant-making foundation reformed in 2005 as an independent nonprofit, is dedicated to supporting women and girls in the islands. The slogan says it all: &#8220;When women thrive, families and communities prosper.&#8221;
	Buehler said they provide grants to small, community-based organizations that directly address the challenges facing women and girls. Instead of funding operational budgets of larger institutions, the Women&#8217;s Fund targets groups in which &#8220;a small grant would have maximum impact,&#8221; or underwrite a specific program within an organization.
	
	&#8220;When I was asked to join the board of directors and I saw the great work they were doing, I took time to reflect on all the blessings in my life and the female mentors who made such a huge impact,&#8221; said Women&#8217;s Fund Tea &#038; Champagne chairwoman Kari Leong. Doing the same for other girls, she realized, &#8220;could make an impact on their lives that would last forever and affect their future choices. If we don&#8217;t support women, who are the heart of the community, oftentimes the community starts to suffer. When our families are balanced and healthy, our community is balanced and healthy.&#8221;

        <itunes:summary>	Bob Hiam started off at Hawaii Medical Service Association’s Claims department processing claims for the business, a core activity for an insurance company.  Patience and perseverance paid off well that 37 years later, he stepped at the helm of Hawaii’s largest health insurance provider – providing healthcare coverage to more than half of the State’s population.
	“It’s an interesting business.  It had opportunities,” Bob says.  “HMSA was growing and adding business at the time and I believe that being at the right place at the right time has a lot to do with things.”  
	“I was there and just sort of worked up thru the levels of management and levels of responsibility,” he adds.

Bob never regrets staying with HMSA for the longest time, and working with wonderful colleagues on a job that he loves stands as the most important factor for his loyalty to the company.
	“Time goes fast and I’ve never regretted not trying anything else,” he claims.
	Bob has passion for his job, and he believes that it is hard to get up in the morning and go to work without a sense of dedication and commitment to one’s mandated tasks.  In this Greater Good Radio, he talks about mistakes and the courage to face misapprehensions.   
	“If anybody goes thru and doesn’t make any mistakes, they probably didn’t do enough or take enough risks,” Bob says.
	Listen to this interview and find out more about what it takes to cast longevity in to your career.

        <itunes:summary>	More than highly innovative products, the founders and owners of C4 Waterman, Hawaii-based manufacturers of surfing equipment, have taken to fore the marketing of their lifestyle.  Todd Bradley, Brian Keaulana, and Mike Fox base their business philosophy on the four core disciplines of a waterman – balance, endurance, strength, and tradition – leading to their C4 brand.  And beyond their mission of advocating the waterman way of life, the C4 owners have grounded a foundation that they hope would protract their already socially veered mindset.  
	Four months in to their business venture, Bradley, Keaulana and Fox are already riding the huge and fast waves of entrepreneurial success that they wish to reflect back to the community soon.

“Our growing pains right now are how to implement the really huge opportunities ahead of us,” Bradley said.  “So once we start to get a control of that, it’s within our game plan and our mission statement to create a foundation that would give back to the community.”
	The business partners and long time friends believe in the power of the water to heal, which is where they want to focus their community initiative.
	“That’s what our foundation would be, a water-oriented thing,” Bradley said.  “It brings you back to reality and helps you clear your head.  Makes your mind right.”
	Todd Bradley and Brian Keaulana share their experiences growing up in Hawaii and how they have become role models to many of the islands’ children.
	Listen now and find out more only here on Greater Good Radio.
	BIO:
	Todd Bradley
Like his partners, it&#8217;s hard to believe Todd Bradley ever sleeps. He lives what he loves and wastes no time in doing so. Balancing family life with a highly successful career in brand-building, sales and marketing, he somehow still managed to reach elite levels in a slew of sports, particularly canoe paddling and surfing. His passion and energy are huge driving forces in the C4 mission of further exploring the waterman lifestyle. 
	Brian Keaulana
Son of legendary, pioneering Hawaiian waterman &#8216;Buffalo&#8217; Keaulana, Brian&#8217;s ocean roots run deep. In both work and play, his life is defined by the ocean. Professional stuntman, stunt coordinator, featured in films such as Riding Giants and Billabong Odyssey, his accomplishments all stem from a life in the ocean. Born and raised on the beach at Makaha, Brian has made major contributions to the surfing world both by way of his own sporting achievements, and through his ocean safety expertise that rewrote the safety and possibilities of enjoying the ocean, saving countless lives along the way. A master of tandem, canoe surfing, big-wave riding, and tow-in, his experience cannot be surpassed.

        <itunes:summary>	Leah Bernstein sits as president of Mountain Apple Company.  Leah has been with Mountain Apple Company since 1980 where she began as a receptionist with only two co-workers. With her involvement, the company continues to achieve unprecedented growth every year of Mountain Apple&#8217;s existence.
	Leah has been involved in the music industry since she was 12, helping out with tons of paper work at the tremendously successful Dunhill Records.  Leah has become a crucial instrument in the promotion of Hawaiian tunes to the rest of the world.

Leah quickly learned and absorbed the spirit of Hawaiian music having been trained in the wild environment of the entertainment business in Los Angeles.  However, for her the learning process involved leaving behind a mentality of superiority over the islanders.  
	 “No one really ever lasts that thinks that they can teach Hawaii how to do it, whatever it is,” she says.  “Whatever business it is, whatever you’re trying to get done.”  
	“I think the best way to communicate is to fit in to the culture you’re in and see what advantages you’re bringing to the table for the other party.  It’s a win-win,” she adds.
	Evan and Kari Leong talks to Leah Bernstein about her career in the music industry, her experience with Hawaii&#8217;s premier recording company, being a female corporate leader, and working as a staunch advocate of Hawaiian music.  
	Hear more about her and Mountain Apple&#8217;s community involvement, and the wonderful array of talents they have served through the years—only here on Greater Good Radio.

David is honored as PBN Business Leader of the Year for 2006 for his outstanding performance in the service lodging and hospitality industry.

David shares why he has become a key advocate in the revamping of the education system in the State, and how he has become such an active promoter of academic learning.
	In the after show, he explains the difference between service and hospitality, giving more importance to the latter with regards to the hotel industry.  David also shares the qualifications that he looks for in the company’s prospective employees, pointing to hospitability and adeptness to work in a team environment as crucial in the workforce’s values.

	Nomination of David Carey, President and CEO,
Outrigger Enterprises For PBN Business Leader of the Year
	Executive Summary
As a business visionary, an advocate for tourism, and a tireless champion for education and the military, W. David P. Carey III – President and CEO of Outrigger Enterprises – has made countless invaluable contributions to Hawaii’s economy, as well as to the community at large. 
	Under his leadership, Outrigger Enterprises has evolved to become the largest independent and locally controlled lodging company in Hawaii, and one of the fastest-growing lodging companies in the Pacific. 
	His vision for Waikiki Beach Walk – a new, $460 million, hotel-retail-entertainment center that is the largest redevelopment project in the history of Waikiki – will bring new life and vitality to an aging part of Waikiki, and serve as a catalyst for further economic development throughout the state. 
	David has lead the discussion in promoting tourism, both now and in transforming it into a sustainable model for the future. He has played an active role in promoting economic development throughout the state. He has been a dynamic leader in the issues that will shape Hawaii’s future, especially public and private education, and a strong military presence in the islands.
	For these and many other reasons, David Carey is Pacific Business News’ Business Leader of the Year.
	Background
David Carey’s educational credentials are impressive. He has a B.S. in electrical engineering from Stanford University, a J.D., cum laude, and an M.B.A., with distinction, from the Santa Clara University. He was a member of the Beta Gamma Sigma Honor Society.
	After graduation in 1982, David move to Honolulu and was an attorney specializing in corporate and real estate law at Carlsmith Wichman Case Mukai and Ichiki. Outrigger Hotels was one of his major clients where he handled several hotel and real estate acquisitions, as well as overall corporate restructuring.
	He subsequently went to work directly for Outrigger as executive vice president and general counsel in 1986. He was named president of the company in 1988, and chief executive officer in 1994.
	Outrigger Enterprises
Under his leadership, Outrigger has evolved from a small hotel company to a multi-faceted international corporation that is as recognized travel marketing leader.
	Outrigger Hotels &#038; Resorts, a division of Outrigger Enterprises, Inc., operates two hotel brands – Outrigger Hotels &#038; Resorts and OHANA Hotels &#038; Resorts &#8212; as well as a portfolio of Outrigger Resort Condominiums and the Outrigger Resort Club timeshare division. With more than 3,000 employees, the company oversees more than 50 hotels, resorts and condominiums throughout the Pacific Region, representing more than 12,000 hotel rooms and condominium units in Hawaii, Micronesia, Australia and the South Pacific.
	Not only has the company undergone tremendous growth and expansion under his direction, David has helped make Outrigger a role model for incorporating Hawaiian cultural values throughout every aspect of its operations. 
	David has also promoted technological innovation throughout the company. Thanks to his leadership, the company was the first non-national chain to integrate on-line technology into its reservation system with travel intermediaries such as Expedia and the major tour operators to the State of Hawaii. To this day Outrigger maintains its status as a tech leader by using technology as a tool to drive down costs and maintain competitiveness in the marketplace. 
	David’s deep commitment to fostering teamwork and to using “upward” appraisals to promote team spirit and cooperation are just two of the ways he has underscored Outrigger’s dedication to promoting employee advancement and development, not to mention make the company a fun and rewarding place to work.
	Thanks to David’s vision and leadership, not only has Outrigger helped promote the romance and magic of Waikiki around the world, it remains one of Hawaii’s most beloved kama’aina companies.
	Waikiki Beach Walk
A decade ago, David Carey had a vision to create a new kind of travel destination in Waikiki, one that would re-energize the area and keep Hawaii competitive in the global tourism marketplace. 
	In April 2005, David’s vision was realized when Outrigger Enterprises broke ground on one of its most exciting endeavors yet &#8212; Waikiki Beach Walk, which is expected to open in November 2006. 
	When completed, Waikiki Beach Walk will capture the best of Hawaii’s natural environment and rich culture, but in an exciting destination complex that will be the first of its kind in Waikiki. Forty retail shops, 6 restaurants and bars, and an open pedestrian plaza integrated among three new and/or completely renovated hotels, and one vacation ownership property will be featured. Visitors and guests alike will want to stroll, shop, dine and enjoy quality entertainment in the lushly landscaped, open-air, Hawaiian-style, setting.
	David played a key role in updating Waikiki zoning codes to enable this kind of comprehensive master-planning to finally take place. 
	Not only will Waikiki Beach Walk help create new jobs and opportunities for local businesses, it will bring back local residents to Waikiki by creating a gathering place especially for them.
	Details regarding Waikiki Beach Walk Phase Two, which is still in the planning stage, will be announced soon. 
	Supporting Education
David has been an active advocate for quality education in Hawaii. He is on the advisory council of the UH College of Business. He has played a key role in helping the Department of Education to run more effectively and efficiently. In his role as Chair of the Interagency Work Group, David helped the Hawaii State Department of Education make the transition to a more effective and professionally run organization. 
	In the private school arena, as a Trustee and Chair of the Building and Grounds Committee, David was instrumental in guiding development and construction of Punahou’s new Case Middle School.
	Supporting the Military
David has also helped to ensure a strong military presence in Hawaii. He has had a long history of supporting both the senior flag officers and enlisted personnel that temporarily call Hawaii their home. As the Chair of the Chamber of Commerce Military Affairs Council, he has led the MAC delegation to Washington D.C., and has worked with senior military leadership here in Hawaii.
	He has also made certain Outrigger continues to make military personnel and their families feel welcome – and appreciated – in Hawaii.
	Business Philosophy
David has employed several key philosophies throughout his career. Hire good people, and give them the tools and support they need to succeed. Invest time in explaining the “why” behind business strategies, which in turn motivates and enables people to help you achieve your goals. Most people spend a considerable part of their day at work, so it’s got to be fun.
	Activities and Interests
Carey is a member of numerous business and community organizations, including the Blood Bank of Hawaii, the Hawaii Hotel Association, the Board of the Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, Hawaii Business Roundtable, American Bar Association, Young President’s Organization, Urban Land Institute and the Hawaii State Bar Association. He is a member and former president of the Oahu Visitors Bureau, on, and a former board member of the Hawaii Tourism Authority, and the University of Hawaii Foundation. 
	He and his wife Kathy – who is an assistant coach for the University of Hawaii’s women’s soccer team – have four children. Carey is an avid golfer and an occasional tennis player.

        <itunes:summary>	Robert Alm is senior vice president of public affairs at Hawaiian Electric Company.  Robert sits as a lecturer for the Public Administration program at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  He serves in more than a dozen community organizations including Helping Hands Hawaii, Boys and Girls Club of Hawaii, and Family Independence Initiative, to name a few.
	Robbie is an Honorary Ali&#8217;I of the Royal Order of Kamehameha I.  He received the Volunteer of the Year Award 2000 from the Alexis de Tocqueville Society of Honolulu.  In the same year, the National Society for Fund Raising Executives (NSFRE) awarded Robbie the Outstanding Volunteer Fund Raiser Award.

According to Robbie, a key for companies to successfully build a relationship with the community is to listen.  He notes that businesses thrive because of the communities they are in and these communities have expectations on how they should conduct their activities.  Without having to meet these expectations, or effectively negotiate a win-win deal, businesses won’t flourish.
	“Communities have expectations about how they want to be treated,” says Robbie.  “I think you start not by what you want to do as a company, but by what people want you to do—what they have been angry that you’ve done in the past, what they’ve liked that you’ve done, especially when you’re a regulated business like us because we are dependent on what government says is ok for us to do, what the public says.”  
	“If you don’t ask them, it’s kind of hard to get it right.  So the first thing we do is listen.  I spend a lot of time listening and we still do that today.  It is very important,” he adds.
	Greater Good Radio brings Robbie Alm as he talks about his involvement with the Live Aloha Program.  Robbie says that the program has drawn hundreds of thousands of supporters from Hawaii and other regions around the world.  Since its inception 12 years ago, Live Aloha continues to gather followers, who want to imbibe in themselves a simple yet crucial tenet of individual responsibility.

        <itunes:summary>	Raynette Tinay is president and chief executive officer of C&#038;J Telecommunications, Inc.  Raynette runs and operates the largest call center in Hawaii.  She fulfills her double bottom line by providing pro bono call center service to non-profit organizations, which have included Easter Seals Hawaii and Abilities Unlimited to help them in their fundraising efforts.
	Despite only reaching the 7th grade, Raynette has strived to learn about the various aspects of life and living.  She has gathered inspiration from her family and close friends to become a successful businesswoman and community leader.

Without proper academic edification, Raynette has used the next available resources to educate herself—personal and others’ experiences.  This Greater Good Radio reveals how she has learned substantial amount of lessons from her children’s education.
	“By reading my son’s musical notes, I taught myself how to play the piano,” Raynette says.  “I benefited a lot from my children’s education, just by the simplest things.”
	In this interview, we get reacquainted about facing adversity head on and not giving up when the situation seems unforgiving.  Raynette Tinay has lived a life many of us could only gather from the news and she shares her experience with us so we would learn and realize that sometimes there are people in more dire situations than us.  
	Listen to this interview and know more about the importance of education and family, facing trials, getting up from a fall, and a whole gamut of life lessons that can surely help us in our day-to-day struggles.
	BIO:
Raynette Tinay is the President and CEO of C&#038;J Telecommunications, Inc. and its’ 2 dbas, Paradise Baskets and Bobalicious.
	Raynette’s education is 7th grade at King Intermediate School in Kaneohe.  Leaving school due to unpleasant and abusive conditions at home, she is self taught in every area of her life.  Getting married and having children at a young age, she had then dedicated her life to her household and family.
	Then, at the age of 29, when her youngest child was 10, she decided that there must be more than cleaning and taking care of her children. She was missing something!  That something was personal growth!
	So….she applied for a job, at what was then, GTE Directories.  On the condition that she gets her GED, she was hired.  She worked full time, took care of her family and went to night school.   After three months she received her GED from Aiea High School.  The transition from “home work” to “work work” was difficult in the beginning.  The balancing act was quite stressful.  
	After working for GTE for 5 years, in 1990, she accepted a position at C&#038;J Telecommunications, Inc. as Administrative Manager.  
	Today, with the help of her children, Raynette owns and operates the largest Call Center in Hawaii.   C&#038;J has diversified itself to become a full service “service”.   For instance, answering the phone for a physician, taking messages and making appointments, all the way to billing the insurance companies for that appointment.   Diversification has been a theme at C&#038;J and that in itself is both challenging and exciting.  
	Working with her children has afforded her the ability to venture out and offer pro bono Call Center and Fulfillment Services for Easter Seals Hawaii and Abilities Unlimited in their fundraising efforts.  These 2 particular organizations hold a dear part in Raynette’s heart as her brother was an Easter Seals beneficiary.
	Raynette is married, the mother of 4 and the grandmother of soon to be 11!

        <itunes:summary>	Jeff Chung and KBFD TV took an unprecedented leap in the local Hawaii media and grabbed the opportunity to bring Korean and other Asian films and TV shows in to the Islands’ broadcast spectrum.  With the introduction of subtitling, Asian programming has become even more popular, not only with Asian-Americans but also the whole community. 
	Chung’s family-run broadcast company started with hour-weekly broadcasts on KIKU-TV in 1976.  Two years later, television broadcasts were increased to four hour weekly on the same channel.  In 1986, under FCC license, KBFD TV became a full-powered UHF channel and Hawaii’s only locally-owned independent TV station.

Greater Good Radio brings Jeff Chung, president and general manager of KBFD TV; and vice president of The Asia Network, the first Korean cable network carried by cable systems in continental US.  In this interview, Jeff talks about his role as chairman of the board of the Hawaii International Film Festival—being the first to be a leader of a major film festival outside of Korea that is of Korean ancestry.  He also speaks of the role of the media, especially television, in shaping the society—and in his case, being able to provide for and influence the ethnic community in the State of Hawaii.  
	Listen now and discover more about Jeff Chung and his belief in the power of the media, and how he uses this power for the greater good of the society.
