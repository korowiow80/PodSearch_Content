Lysistrata, Uber-Ancient-Greek-Activist, calls women to join her in a sex strike until desperation brings the men to their...senses.Lysistrata is the third and last of Aristophanes&apos; peace plays, says translator Alan H. Sommerstein in his preface to the play:  it was &apos;&apos;conceived at a time when Athens was going through the most desperate crisis she had known since the Persian War.&apos;&apos; As I say in this introduction to the play, although I&apos;ve known about Lysistrata for decades, I&apos;d always assumed it was a fairly grave play.  Don&apos;t get me wrong--I prefer Greek tragedy to many forms of spectacle currently on Broadway!  But Lysistrata is a bawdy comedy and, although one could argue that women would never achieve the solidarity necessary to carry off an effective sex strike, Aristophanes nails human foibles and stereotypes as recognizable to a 21st Century listener as to the audience of its first production in 411 B.C.Stay tuned for the reading of LYSISTRATA.</description>

<description>The American Psychological Association is sponsoring a Blog Party to mark Mental Health Month.  This podcast is a reading from Judith Lewis Herman&apos;s book Trauma and Recovery:  The aftermath of violence--from domestic abuse to political terror.  In this Chapter, titled A Forgotten History, Herman discusses how the women&apos;s movement brought violence against women into public awareness and put it on the trauma spectrum.  Today, as a result of feminist activism, we recognize that rape, domestic violence and incest result in post-traumatic stress disorder.</description>

<description>&apos;&apos;In the public discourse the fetus has been elevated to an equal status with a living, breathing human being.  More and more, women are viewed as the enemy of children, requiring the State&apos;s intervention to protect their developing children from them.  But, in reality, women still conceive, nurture, give birth to and, in most cases, are the primary caregivers of children.  Women are being reduced, once again, to the incubators of future generations with total responsibility but no power.  That is the same oppressive view that the women&apos;s movement sought to challenge.  It is not just abortion, but women&apos;s power to control their destinies that is at stake.&apos;&apos;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These words were written in 1995 by Laura Kaplan, who was a member of Jane, the underground abortion service that developed in Chicago before abortion was legalized in Roe v. Wade.  In her book, The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service, Kaplan narrates an age-old story replayed in the context of the women&apos;s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s.  The story reminds us that abortion has been and will always be a decision &apos;&apos;rooted in the concrete conditions&apos;&apos; of a woman&apos;s life.  &apos;&apos;She will weigh her decision and then try to act on it.  This is what women have always done, irrespective of the law or even of the risks to their own lives.&apos;&apos;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this podcast, I connect The Story of Jane to the current abortion battles, and then read excerpts of Kaplan&apos;s introduction to this riveting and relevant story for all women.</description>

<description>Goodbye, cursive!  &lt;br&gt;Last week a friend with young children in the public schools said &apos;&apos;Did you know they&apos;re not teaching cursive in school anymore?  How are my kids going to sign their names?&apos;&apos;  We scratched our heads--we didn&apos;t know.  A few days after this, when my husband was going through boxes of his family&apos;s photos, documents and artifacts, he found a small leather book that had belonged to his great-grandfather.  Its aging, delicate pages were filled with poems and wishes to be remembered, all in cursive styles from days gone by.  Listen to these poems and heartfelt demonstrations of friendship read aloud.  You can also visit http://madamaambi.blogspot.com to see cursive styles from the late 1800&apos;s.</description>

In this podcast, I read aloud the opinion of the Court, which inquires into, &apos;&apos;and in this opinion place some emphasis upon, medical and medical-legal history and what that history reveals about man&apos;s attitude  toward the abortion procedure over the centuries.&apos;&apos;  Justice Blackmun discusses &apos;&apos;Ancient Attitudes, The Hippocratic Oath, The common law, The English statutory law, The American law, The position of the American Medical Association, and The position of the American Public Health Association.&apos;&apos;  I discovered many fascinating insights into the underpinnings of the current abortion battles still raging in 2011.

<description>Jennifer Pozner comes out swinging as she takes aim at the &apos;&apos;Reality TV&apos;&apos; industry and its ever-growing universe of so-called &apos;&apos;harmless&apos;&apos; shows in her book REALITY BITES BACK: The Troubling Truth About Guilty Pleasure TV, published by Seal Press.

This is an important book, fun to read, and what Library Journal has determined &apos;&apos;an essential read.&apos;&apos;  Pozner&apos;s research and analysis are mind-blowing, but you really have to hear Jennifer Pozner in person to understand the passion and knife-sharp wit she brings to her work.</description>

<description>Patty Sherman says that she &apos;&apos;escaped&apos;&apos; her abusive marriage in 2000.  In June of this year, 2010, she passed the ninth anniversary of her freedom, healing process and the recovery of her self.  Patty speaks out to educate the public because she knows that it&apos;s hard, if not impossible, to understand how it happens and how hard it is to leave an abusive marriage unless you have either lived through it or you have done intentional research about the pathologies that drive husbands to control and berate their wives.In this interview we discuss how it&apos;s possible for an educated and skilled woman to fear her husband, to lose her confidence or the right to discuss dysfunctional dynamics in their marriage and to develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  In hindsight, Patty has come to understand some of the warning signs of the cycle of abuse and the traps victims can fall into, such as believing that &apos;&apos;I had let it happen to me.&apos;&apos;  Through therapy and self-education, she now knows she didn&apos;t deserve the abuse she received.  Patty hopes that by speaking out she can help other victims realize that there is nothing they did to bring abuse upon themselves, nothing they can do to mollify a husband&apos;s need to control them, keeping them fearful and dehumanized, why it&apos;s hard to leave and how it&apos;s possible to get help.</description>

<description>Jen Nedeau blogs about Women&apos;s Rights at Change.org.  She&apos;s not a seasoned feminist who has it all figured out in fact, her feminist awakening began only a year ago.  But she understands that women of her generation have grown up with a dangerous sense of equality that does not sync with real-world politics.

<itunes:summary>Jen Nedeau blogs about Women&apos;s Rights at Change.org.  She&apos;s not a seasoned feminist who has it all figured out in fact, her feminist awakening began only a year ago.  But she understands that women of her generation have grown up with a dangerous sense of equality that does not sync with real-world politics.  This interview was recorded in March of 2009.</itunes:summary>

<description>Interview with Rachel Blum, recorded April 11, 2009, roughly a year since she began transitioning from living as a man to living as a woman.  Although there is much to say about the issues presented in a story like Rachel&apos;s, I find that I am profoundly moved by what Rachel has shared with me, and can only frame this conversation with music that expresses my feelings.  Very brief selections from a live recording of La Traviata with Alfredo Kraus and Maria Callas are included in this podcast.</description>

<description>WAM! Bang! Blogher!  Born with an innate sense of fairness, Veronica organized her first protest in 2nd grade and by the time she was in high school knew she was feminist.  Veronica is ubiquitous in the blogosphere as well as speaking at conferences this year, and our conversation covers her work in reproductive justice, the marketing of mommyblogging and her work on legislation in her home state of Illinois.

<description>&apos;&apos;SPEAK! is a group of women of color media makers.  With contributions from all over the U.S., these recordings are testimonials of struggle, hope, and love.  Proceeds of this album will go towards funding single mothers traveling to the 2009 Allied Media Conference in Detroit, MI.&apos;&apos; (from the album liner notes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here is my interview with Adele Nieves, who produced the album as well as contributed its first track.  This CD packs a punch, and you&apos;re welcome, you needed that. Powerful, lyrical, musical, beautiful, angry, strong and vulnerable, Adele Nieves and the women of SPEAK! are not sitting around waiting to be granted a seat at the table. They have discovered themselves. So, if you&apos;re ready to shut up, sit down and listen to radical women of color media makers, you can buy the CD at www.speakmediacollective.com.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The interview opens with Adele reading her piece, Why Do You Speak?, and our conversation ends with a taste of Wishful Thinking by Alexis Pauline Gumbs. Watch for this poem set to music to be released as a single on iTunes! You will want it and you will want to give it to every woman you know.&lt;br&gt;</description>
