            <description><![CDATA[<p>This episode is basically a long-winded rundown of my recent SoCal/Hawaii solo run. I wanted to get Allyson in on the fun but she's got the flu this week and I didn't want to bug her :) I also included some bits from some recent voicemails I requested and a demo of a song that hasn't ever been released officially, called 'Almost 50 Like I Am'. When the f**k is iTunes gonna pick thi podcast up? Maybe i'll quit the band if they don't soon.</p>]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://kevinseconds.libsyn.com/the-econoline-sessions-podcast-with-kevin-seconds-episode-2]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I REALLY struggled with this one. It wasn't that I wasn't into it, I was. I just felt like I didn't have much to talk about or share. Boy, what a croc of shit that is...in this episode, I chirp on about my terrible procrastinating. I play GOTCHA with Allyson and her ironic, hipster ways. I share my recent version of the Ramones classic, Listen To My Heart. I talk about myself more and answer peoples' question about me. I include a tiny snippet of a recording in made at 2 in the morning at my gym of this chubby club chick who spent her gym time, talking about getting drunk after she left (close your eyes and the audio snippet sounds eerily like something from a crappy porn but it's not). I play weird shit on the Moog app on my iPhone and most importantly, I debut all the really cool new show IDs I begged for from Facebook pals. This episode is EPIC!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The "pilot episode". I started recording this just before Christmas 2011 and decided to mix and match audio and subjects because I didn't have my shit together enough to have a game plan before I started. Whatever. My wife Allyson joins me for a talk about what a fuckin' grinch I am and not just at Christmas. I also talk about a recent de-friending of a friend on Facebook, the first day of this new year. Oh, and I included my new song, "Don't Let Me Lose Ya" with a special guest vocal appearance by....yep, Al. &nbsp;Enjoy.</p>]]></description>
