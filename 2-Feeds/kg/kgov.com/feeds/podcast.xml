Neanderthals were MAN&lt;/strong&gt;: Now that geneticists have sequenced the entire &lt;a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/328/5979/710.full" target="_blank"&gt;Neanderthal genome&lt;/a&gt;, they have proved wrong many of the world's leading evolutionists who had long claimed that Neanderthals were not &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;a href="http://RealScienceFriday.com/list-of-not-so-old-things" title="RSF's List of Not So Old Things"&gt;young age of the earth&lt;/a&gt;, and that life had to be specially created because it is&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="kgov.com/information-based" title="RSF: The Best Cell Biology DVD"&gt;information based&lt;/a&gt;, prove that Man was specially created and that there never was such a thing as an ape/human ancestor. Now, DNA proves that Neanderthal men and women were fully man, that is, they were &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, because along with many other indicators, genetically they are closer to  modern humans than two living chimps of the same species are to one another!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;* Answers in Genesis Keeping RSF Informed&lt;/strong&gt;: The current edition of the flagship publication of Ken Ham's Answers in Genesis presents a great series of caveman articles by David Menton, John UpChurch, Andrew Snelling, Mike Matthews, and Georgia Purdom, including as Purdom &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v7/n2" target="_blank" title="Answers magazine issue; article currently not online..."&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;, "two modern chimps of the same species will have more DNA variation than Neanderthals or Denisovans have to modern humans." Taking the lead from &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/am/v7/n2" target="_blank" title="Spring 2012 edition"&gt;Answers&lt;/a&gt;,  RSF co-hosts Bob Enyart (above left) and &lt;a href="http://evolutionfairytale.com" target="_blank"&gt;Fred Williams&lt;/a&gt; (right) put themselves in a &lt;span&gt;caveman&lt;/span&gt;'s moccasins :) to figure out why Neanderthal (and others) lived in caves and why they looked so different. RSF believes that "&lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;", Neanderthal, etc., lived in caves only temporarily, to escape bad weather, etc., and they looked so different only because of ethnic differences which were often exaggerated by &lt;a href="http://www.answersingenesis.org/articles/arj/v3/n1/neanderthals" target="_blank" title="See Anne Habermehl's Enigmatic Neanderthals paper at AiG  "&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://KGOV.com/files/images/science/Neanderthal-Tattersall-lg.jpg" title="enlarge image"&gt;&lt;img src="http://KGOV.com/files/images/science/Neanderthal-Tattersall.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 9pt 3px 0px; border: 2px solid black;" height="377" width="286" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;* Preemptively Correcting Evolutionists&lt;/strong&gt;: Invariably, when evolutionists get proven wrong on a major prediction, even one in print for decades, atheist and other Darwinist listeners to RSF will claim, "Evolutionists never said such a thing." Even before our RSF Caveman program aired, the guys told an evolutionist about the Neanderthal sequencing, who replied, "Evolutionists never claimed that Neanderthals were a difference species." So, to the evolutionists who post at &lt;a href="http://www.evolutionfairytale.com/forum/" target="_blank" title="Creation forum that readily enforces its rules on evolutionists"&gt;EvolutionFairytale.com&lt;/a&gt; and at the BEL forum at &lt;a href="http://www.theologyonline.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=42" target="_blank" title="WARNING: Rough and tumble environment..."&gt;TheologyOnline.com&lt;/a&gt;, before you accuse someone of making an error, it would help if you fact checked your own claim. Preemptively today, Bob Enyart's 12-year-old son Michael found this 1995 book and checked it out of his local public library, &lt;em&gt;The Last Neanderthal&lt;/em&gt;, a book sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History. The author, paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall, described as "one of the most respected authorities on the subject," claimed that the word "'human' is extremely ill-defined," and that, "As used here, 'human' ... is more lossely employed to refer to all primates that share a common ancestry uniquely with us, from &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; on." This is science by definition. It reminds us of the evolutionists who argue that we should simply "define" various domestic dog breeds as different species. Thus, like magic, by science by definition they can then prove that speciation occurs commonly. Viola! On classification, Tattersall went on to say that, "in my view and that of a growing number of colleagues, there is no good reason to doubt that the Neanderthals deserve recognition as a species of there own." Except that they were not. And DNA doesn't lie. So Tattersall knew of no good reason, that is, other than that creationists disagreed with him. And since creationists have a better track record regarding scientific predictions, on those grounds alone Tattersall should have been more cautious. For then, he wouldn't have been falsified just a few years later on yet another major prediction from Darwinists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://kgov.com/The-Real-Science-Friday-Caveman-Show" target="_blank"&gt;read more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BobEnyartLive/~4/9o7Gj-4HzXg" height="1" width="1"/&gt;</description>
