            <description><![CDATA[<span>This is a Special Edition of <i><strong>A Music To Swear By Show</strong></i> featuring my new <i><strong>Music On The Wild Side</strong></i> podcast series that highlights all my CDs. It will be a brief podcast (5-10 minutes)&nbsp;that will have sample songs, jingles, skits, and parodies about all different areas of news and things going on. This first episode features a song about the brand new Apple iPhones just released (they’re nice!). It’s called <i><strong>iPhonatic</strong></i> and its upgraded version, <i><strong>iPhonatic</strong> 2.1, </i>will be on my new CD <i><strong>Music To Swear By – A Second Dose</strong></i> that will be available this fall. Both my <i><strong>Science On The Wild Side</strong></i> CDs are available for purchase at cdbaby.com/cd/rickquarles and individual songs can be listened to and purchased at iTunes, Rhapsody, Napster, Payplay.fm, Snocap.com, and many others. <strong>My </strong><i><strong>Music To Swear By</strong> </i>CD is currently available at cdbaby.com/cd/rickquarles3 and should soon be available at those other places, too. Hope you enjoy. You can leave any comments and suggestions on my podcast blog page.</span>]]></description>
