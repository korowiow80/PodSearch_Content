            <title>9/16/07- Show 2 segment 2-Interview with Rick Vallini, founder of HomeFixers &amp; author of NY Times best seller FLIP: How To Find, Fix And Sell Houses For Profit</title>
            <description>&lt;br /&gt;
Interview with author of Flip: How to Find, Fix and Sell Houses for Profit Rick Villani&lt;br /&gt;

Rick Villani bought, fixed up and sold his first investment property 15 years ago, and he hasn’t stopped since. Villani turned his passion for rebuilding houses into a thriving business with the launch of HomeFixers Corp. in 2001. The firm assists real estate investors in assessing, renovating and selling houses for profit. HomeFixers, which has affiliate offices in Dallas, Houston, Atlanta and Orlando, has consulted on more than a thousand fix-and-flip projects.

For the six years prior to launching HomeFixers, Villani worked for Fortune 500 computer maker, Dell Inc. During that time, he became one of the company’s top salesmen and quickly moved into management. He developed Dell’s training program for its billion-dollar peripherals sales division and later moved into a business development role launching other sales divisions within the company. 

Before Dell, Villani started and sold two companies — an apparel business and a gourmet food company.  He started his career after college as an account executive for an advertising agency working on national packaged goods products.

Villani graduated in 1985 from the University of Texas at Austin with a bachelor’s degree in advertising. He wrote his first book, Life’s Little Construction Book, in 1995. The author lives in Austin, Texas, with his wife, Carrie, and their three children, Emily, Jack and Anne. His interests include cooking, reading philosophy, sailing and running.</description>
