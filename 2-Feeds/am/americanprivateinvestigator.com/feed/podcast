		<itunes:summary>The May 2012 podcast of The American Private Investigator with your host, Paul Jaeb of Heartland Investigative Group, features Mike McIntee and Paul Jaeb with the API news segment. Hear about how Lake County officials near Chicago hired a private investigator to look into two deaths in the county jail, how a private investigator is helping in a missing college student case that stumped police due to lack of leads, how a Washington state man got a sentence after threatening an investigator with a weapon, and how Ikea France admits hiring an investigator to spy on customers and employees.
Next, Terry Cox, CLI, current National Director of the National Association of Legal Investigators, and Ellis Armistead, CLI, President of Heartland Investigative Group, join Paul to talk about how to handle very large, media driven criminal cases. Terry and Ellis gained their expertise in cases that were sensational in their time. Among these, Terry Cox handled the Mary Winkler preacher’s wife murder trial in Tennessee, and Ellis handled federal appeal of Timothy McVeigh. Hear the details about each case, how each got involved, what attracts a media frenzy, how press scrutiny can affect the investigator’s personal life, and learn how to balance the work without losing your core clients.
Regular contributor Peter Psarouthakis of ISPLA joins Paul with a legislative update and to talk about what’s going on nationally among private investigators. Hear about the latest bills, such as the right to carry reciprocity act, and what ISPLA is doing to support this bill and the private investigator industry. Hear how ISPLA was at the forefront in Indiana where the legislature introduced a bill to repeal mandatory licensing of private investigators, security guards and a host of other professions. Learn how ISPLA helped kill that bill and how your involvement can help protect and support the industry.
Tune in next month to learn about how investigators expand their businesses into other areas, like security, forensics, pre-employment screening, and get the scoop on using metrics within your company to better manage your business.

		<itunes:summary>The February 2012 podcast of The American Private Investigator with your host, Paul Jaeb of Heartland Investigative Group, features Mike McIntee and Paul Jaeb with the API news segment.  Learn about a recent BBC Breakfast feature on PI industry licensing and stopping illegal activities, such as phone hacking.

Next, hear why PIs are being asked to help out in cases of missing fryer oil in LA. Then get the scoop on PIs helping a mayor’s group gather evidence against gun retailers involved in illegal selling practices.

Then, Phil Becnel of Dinolt Becnel &amp; Wells Investigative Group LLC joins Paul to talk about his election in October 2011 to president of the Private Investigators Association of Virginia and his new book, Principles of Investigative Documentation. Phil gives Paul and listeners a sneak peek at key elements to best investigative documentation practices along with examples and practical applications.

Learn about taking verbatim statements from hostile or unhelpful witnesses and obtaining declarations from friendly witnesses. Get tips on the best note taking methods, setting documentation retention timelines and criteria, and more practical guidelines to fine tune your practice and the way you present yourself for better results. Regular contributor Alan Goodman joins Paul to talk about how to set client expectations and what happens if you don’t. Learn how to better communicate with difficult clients and outlandish requests right out of the gate. Hear Paul and Alan review and expand on key points mentioned by fellow investigator Kevin Cosgrove in his article for Pursuit Magazine entitled, “Dealing With Client Expectations.” Get practical advice from Alan and Paul on how to be upfront, careful, practical, and about the lessons seasoned investigators have learned in the field that can help you avoid pitfalls and build your practice.

Hear about how British Parliament’s Home Affairs Committee Chairman Rt Hon Keith Vaz MP announced an inquiry into regulating Private Investigators. Next, how more companies are relying on private investigators to keep up on social media for investigating employees, relationship management problems, and competitors. The next story focuses on state licensing of private investigations and cross-state investigations. Also in the news, are you going to need a license to do Google Search or risk a felony?
Regular API guest, Dave Pelligrinelli, CEO at AFX Search, joins Paul to talk about best practices and pitfalls for pricing private investigative services. Learn how to avoid competing on price and how to price your services in a way that’s sustainable for your customer and for your business.
Hear Sue Ginsburg, President and CEO, GrowthLynx, on how to use and build your LinkedIn profile to grow your business. Learn easy steps for getting started as slowly as you wish, and how businesses use this fast-growing media to network for new clients and client retention.
Next, Pat Clawson joins Peter Psarouthakis, ISPLA, and Alan Goodman, Lawyers Investigating Service for the year in review round table on the state of the Private Investigator industry. New guest Pat Clawson is a former award-winning investigative reporter for CNN and NBC News, a registered private investigator in Virginia, a CJA Investigator in the District of Columbia, a Certified Process Server in Michigan, and a longtime open government and freedom of information advocate.
Peter starts this segment with a review of the latest legislative issues concerning privacy, access to information, destruction of federal records, camera legislation and covert surveillance, and ISPLA’s involvement.
Next, Pat provides commentary about the tightening of privacy protections, what’s driving this effort, and what can investigators do to be heard given that privacy advocates have the advantage.
Hear Alan’s commentary on legislative issues in his locale and how investigators can educate legislators on the way investigators act as private law enforcement and use information tools to protect citizens as well as provide justice for those facing criminal charges.
Learn more about how Pat Clawson uncovered the destruction of federal records, and hear Pat and Peter with background details about the effort to stop the destruction, why the media isn’t airing this story, and what you can do to help.
Pat implores investigators to pick up the phone and call the Chief Judge in your district to let them know how the record destruction issue impacts using this information to protect citizens and provide justice. This education and direct outreach about the impact of this destruction can help change the tide if enough investigators get involved. In addition, investigators can sign the petition at http://ispla.org/fedrecords (http://ispla.org/fedrecords).

Dave recently tweaked his business plan and offers a new perspective on developing an agency and the importance of switching one’s mindset from that of a private investigator to an agency owner. Paul and Dave discuss that clients want to pay for answers to problems, not for a service.  Dave will be a regular contributor to the podcast.
Alan Goodman with Lawyers Investigating Service, Inc. and Paul have a discussion on licensing and current trends affecting the profession.  And, as usual, Paul and producer Mike McIntee open the show with the API News segment.

The January 2011 podcast of The American Private Investigator with your host, Paul Jaeb, features an API News Update with Mike McIntee, and a roundtable with Rich Robertson of R3 Investigations and Ellis Armistead of Heartland Investigative Group focusing on death penalty investigation, as well as upcoming industry events with Alan Goodman of Lawyers Investigating Service, Inc., and a critical legislative update by Peter Psarouthakis of ISPLA.
In the death penalty case roundtable, Rich and Ellis give in depth coverage about how they come upon and investigate death penalty cases, the ideal skill set and training for tackling both investigation and presentation of the case, and the challenges, practical aspects, and best practices for handling death penalty cases successfully while keeping the rest of your investigative practice intact.
Next, Alan Goodman uncovers the key upcoming industry events, and then joins Rich and Ellis to share his views on the benefits and potential pitfalls of handling death penalty investigations.
Peter Psarouthakis joins the podcast to talk about the current flurry of critical legislative activity affecting the investigative industry, how ISPLA monitors, tracks, and advocates, and how all investigators can get involved both as advocates and by joining ISPLA, gaining the additional benefit of ISPLA’s cost saving member insurance program.

		<itunes:summary>The July 2010 podcast of The American Private Investigator with your host, Paul Jaeb, opens with Mike McIntee, the podcast&#039;s producer, with our new feature: The API News Update.

Craig is also a visiting assistant professor in the Department of Communication Studies at the University of Montana. In this podcast, Craig discusses the anonymous survey he&#039;s developed for the industry.

Craig will share all the findings with all private investigators and process serving agencies who take the survey at http://bit.ly/pi-survey (http://bit.ly/pi-survey). Note that info submitted is confidential and will not be linked back to individual investigators or firms. Next, Peter Psarouthakis of ISPLA gives an update ISPLA&#039;s vital involvement as legislative advocates working with Congress, lobbyists, and others on bills ranging from anti-spoofing, surveillance, social security access, and financial reform. In his segment, Peter reveals the latest on a critical exemption for private investigators on a bill regarding placement of a GPS tracking device on their vehicle without their knowledge or consent. Peter also invites any state association, group of investigators, or security professionals who need help in creating new law, or combat or mend a law on behalf of the investigative and security industries to contact ISPLA at www.ispla.org (http://www.ispla.org/).
