Meanwhile, Felicity Ford shows us her favourite knitted walking stick cosies and Peter Wyton performs his poem about getting chucked out of a pub... for knitting.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Recorded at the UK's first &lt;a href="http://www.iknit.org.uk/stitchnbitchday.html"&gt;Stitch 'n' Bitch Day&lt;/a&gt; in November 2007. (Features: &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/girlanddean"&gt;Girl and Dean&lt;/a&gt; &amp;middot; &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/debbiestoller"&gt;Debbie Stoller&lt;/a&gt; &amp;middot; &lt;a href="http://www.missability.com/"&gt;The Missability Radio Show&lt;/a&gt; &amp;middot; &lt;a href="http://www.myspace.com/peterwytonpoet"&gt;Peter Wyton&lt;/a&gt;)

			<title>Chiptunes: Nintendo Music</title>
			<link>http://mcld.co.uk/flatfour/archivedownload/FlatFourRadioChiptunesNintendoMusic/FlatFourRadioChiptunesNintendo.mp3</link>
			<description>Flat Four has been looking into the world of music made on &quot;retro&quot; computers - the models of computer produced in the early 80s. These computers have limited sound capabilities, and what with human nature being the way it is, that seems to have inspired lots of musicians to work hard at playing with and challenging those limitations, and making a wealth of innovative music in the process. The programmes feature interviews with some of the original &quot;gods&quot; of 8-bit music, as well as members of the modern &quot;demo scene&quot;, and other people who have decided that these retro sounds are where it&#039;s at. And even more, the programmes feature lots and lots of really excellent music. Beat that!</description>

			<description>Auden Prim could be one of the best new bands in the world, never mind the UK. Hailing from Norway originally, but then deciding that Liverpool would be a fun place to base themselves, they perform a blistering and well-honed set - as evidenced by this recording from the launch event for the Curious Generation nights.</description>

			<description>A documentary tribute to the anti-war protest marches which took place around the world on April 12th 2003, during the build up to Gulf War II. All the sounds in this piece were recorded on the London demo that day. The recording captures the enthusiasm and the motivation in the protesters and speakers&#039; own words, and the exuberance of the marching drums that accompanied them.</description>
