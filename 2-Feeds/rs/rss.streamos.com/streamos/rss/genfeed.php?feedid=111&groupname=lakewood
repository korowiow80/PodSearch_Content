      <description>The same God that opens doors will close doors. Maybe you prayed and didn't get the job you really wanted or a relationship didn't work out. It's easy to allow rejection to lead to discouragement and think that God is not working in your life. But God sees the bigger picture for your life. He knows where every road is leading and where the dead ends are.

Proverbs 20:24 says, "A person's steps are directed by the Lord. How then can anyone understand their own way?"

When you realize you are in the palm of God's hand and that nothing happens without His divine purpose, then you will begin to see and realize that the closed doors are just as important as the open doors.</description>

      <description>We all go through disappointments, setbacks and things we don't understand. Maybe you prayed for a loved one, but they didn't get well. Or, maybe you worked hard for a promotion, but you didn't get it. You stood in faith for a relationship, but it didn't work out. 

Proverbs 20:24 says, "Since the Lord is directing our steps, why do we try to figure out everything that happens along the way?" 

Instead of trying to find a reason behind everything that happens, one of the best things you can do is release it to God and let it go. God is directing you every step of the way. He has a way of causing all things to work together for your good. Your part is to trust and release.</description>

      <description>Isaiah 14:27 says, "The LORD of hosts has purposed, and who will annul it?" (ESV)

God's plan for your life can't be stopped by a bad break, someone leaving you, an injustice or a mistake.

It's easy to think that because we aren't where we want to be in life, or we've made poor decisions or faced unfortunate setbacks that God's plans for our life are over. Nothing you have done or haven't done can cancel you from your destiny as long as you keep God first place and continually seek Him. When you don't see a way, God can make a way. When it looks like it's over, God has the final say.</description>

      <description>It's easy to focus on others' faults and what we would like to change about them. But, God is the one that put the talents, creativity and strengths into each person. 

Isaiah 64:8 says, "We're the clay and you're our potter: all of us are what you made us." (The Message)

Our job isn't to change people. Learn to accept that God is the one directing their steps, making them and molding them into who He wants them to be. If you'll learn to love, honor and accept people for who they are right now, your relationships will go to a whole new level.</description>

      <title>#537 - God Loves Imperfect People</title>
      <link>http://www.joelosteen.com/pages/podcastitem.aspx?pid=45&amp;audio=true</link>
      <author>info@joelosteen.com (Joel Osteen)</author>
      <description>God loves and uses imperfect people. We all make mistakes. But because Jesus died and rose from the grave, every mistake we will make or ever make has been paid in full. Don't let shame and guilt keep you from receiving God's love any longer. Psalm 103:12 (NIV) says, "As far as the east is from the west, our sins are removed from God's memory." Since God has removed them from His memory, it's time we do the same and move forward with God and receive His love and mercy. 

You may have made mistakes, but God still believes in you, loves you and has an amazing future in store. Keep your heart toward God, and He will show Himself strong on your behalf!</description>
