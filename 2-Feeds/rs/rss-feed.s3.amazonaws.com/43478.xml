      <description>You don&amp;#8217;t know darkness unless you know light. And you don&amp;#8217;t know light unless you know darkness. The darkness is a mandatory part of the process. If you have a goal to achieve more success, more money, greater projects, greater prosperity, you&amp;#8217;ve got to go through those times of incredible doubt, despair, freaking out, worry, concern &amp;#8211; those things just come up. And what they do is they cause you to consider what is next. They cause you to consider what might be missing. So, you have to have those dark moments. I just want you take this thought into your body: Success ultimately is nothing more than a series of well-managed breakdowns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please check out this powerful training program, and get on your way to achieving massive action!&amp;#10;http://www.matthewferry.com/massiveaction/</description>

      <description>How do you pick a life coach! I think that the main thing you need to do is decide what exactly you want to get out of the life coach process. For example, my specialty in the process is happiness and peace, and then utilizing that to be an action. But that&amp;#8217;s not everybody&amp;#8217;s specialty.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please check out this powerful training program http://www.matthewferry.com/program/</description>

      <description>A lot of people say, &amp;#8220;If I take on a lot of responsibility, I&amp;#8217;m going feel trapped and I won&amp;#8217;t have the freedom that I want.&amp;#8221; I&amp;#8217;m here to tell you that, actually, that&amp;#8217;s the exact opposite. The more responsibility you take on in your life, the projects, the things that you&amp;#8217;re up to, the things that you&amp;#8217;re committed to in your life, the more freedom you have. Because when you take responsibility, you basically say, &amp;#8220;I am the creator of this. I&amp;#8217;m going to make this happen.&amp;#8221;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please check out powerful training program:&amp;#10;http://www.matthewferry.com/program/</description>

      <title>The Power of Connective Communication</title>
      <link>http://rss-feed.s3.amazonaws.com/video/30709_1_Power_of_Connective_Communication.mov</link>
      <description>When you are outcome-oriented in your communication, you&amp;#8217;re going to have a more difficult time communicating versus when you are connection-oriented. When your goal is to connect with a person, understand them and their world, to know who they are, see what they&amp;#8217;re up to, you&amp;#8217;re going to find that things just go effortlessly. It&amp;#8217;s smooth. It&amp;#8217;s easy. But when you&amp;#8217;re selfishly oriented, trying to make what you want happen &amp;#8211; trying to produce and outcome in your communication, you&amp;#8217;re just going to find that things are difficult and hard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I recommend that you spend your time working on being concerned, trying to understand, seeking to appreciate. And what you&amp;#8217;ll find is: Communication is a breeze there.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please check out powerful training program:&amp;#10;http://www.matthewferry.com/program/</description>

      <description>If you pay attention to your mind, you will see that it is judging, assessing, evaluating, quantifying, categorizing everything.

      <description>If you want to be happy, then you need to stop pretending that you are psychic. You need to quit pretending that you can look at the outside of people and see who they are. You can not. You have no idea who people are. You look at someone and you think, Oh, that is what that person is. And then, they do something different, it breaks your expectations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sign Up Today for Inspired Action Weekly and Receive bonuses including A Private Weekend Retreat with Matthew Ferry.&amp;#10;http://www.matthewferry.com/program/</description>

      <title>How to be Happy</title>
      <link>http://rss-feed.s3.amazonaws.com/video/30709_1_How_to_be_Happy.mov</link>
      <description>There is a fallacy that says if you work really hard right now and make lots of money, then you will be able to make yourself happy. It does not work that way. So, what if you will make a lot of money and you get to the place where you envision. Oh, the clouds part, the sun is shining through, and there&amp;#8217;s angels singing, and there is harps playing. But you are still be unhappy. Why, Because happiness is a skill. Happiness is not something that is externally located. So although you can get momentary hits of happiness through external things, ultimately, the long-term happiness comes from you implementing a set of skills.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 Reasons 2011 Will suck and How to Make Sure It Wont&amp;#10;http://matthewferry.com/bestyearever2011/</description>

      <description>Here are three actions that you can take that will make you happy.  The first action is called devotion.  What exactly does devotion mean,  It is a way of being. It is about being in the moment, and doing what you are doing in that moment to the very best of your ability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 Reasons 2011 Will suck and How to Make Sure It Wont&amp;#10;http://matthewferry.com/bestyearever2011/</description>

      <description>Happiness is not a choice, it is a skill. Recently, I read an article that said that happiness is a choice, and I completely disagree. When you are unhappy, it is a reaction. The way I see it, happiness is not a choice, it is a conditioned response.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 Reasons 2011 Will suck and How to Make Sure It Wont&amp;#10;http://matthewferry.com/bestyearever2011/</description>

      <description>I do not think this is going to be very politically correct, but I would like to point out that happiness is really for stupid people.  Because those who over think things, can&amp;#226;&amp;#8364;&amp;#8482;t be happy.  Thinking, in general, does not lead to happiness. &amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 Reasons 2011 Will suck and How to Make Sure It Wont&amp;#10;http://matthewferry.com/bestyearever2011/</description>

      <description>Something that I want you to notice is that nobody else is really ever changing. What is changing is your perspective or point of view. So many of my friends who are engaged in the Inspired Action Weekly program are radically changing their point of view, and they are becoming so much happier, so much more attractive, so much more productive.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 Reasons 2011 Will suck and How to Make Sure It Wont&amp;#10;http://matthewferry.com/bestyearever2011/</description>

      <description>Recently, one of my clients wrote to me with the question, What do I do, when I find myself reacting negatively to the people that I love, And I start by saying, lets define love. I say that love is acceptance, total and complete acceptance of all people and all situations, at all times. Now, that is not easy to attain.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4 Reasons 2011 Will suck and How to Make Sure It Wont&amp;#10;http://matthewferry.com/bestyearever2011/</description>
