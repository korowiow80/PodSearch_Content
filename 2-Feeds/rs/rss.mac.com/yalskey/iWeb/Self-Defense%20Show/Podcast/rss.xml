Talk of physical resistance (offensive) techniques!!!  I know you all out there have been waiting for it.  Now, here it is.  After 68 previous episodes on all kinds of other violence protection issues, I feel there is finally enough in the can to go ahead and talk about this over emphasized subject.  Now it's in the correct proportion to the other topics covered.  1/69th of effective self-defense is physical offense techniques!  LOL  Well, sort of.  Anyway, Charles is alone on this episode so brace yourselves for a lecture way over an hour again.  Charles reviews 12 physical tactics that can be used to cause emergency room level injuries to your assailant in order for you to escape or to stop the threat.  This episode goes very well with episode 028 in which we discuss Non-Combative Techniques, and episode 042 where we talk about defensive / protective techniques.  With the 028, 042, 069 episode combo, you should have generally all the techniques you will ever need..</description>

<itunes:summary>[CLEAN]  At last!  Talk of physical resistance (offensive) techniques!!!  I know you all out there have been waiting for it.  Now, here it is.  After 68 previous episodes on all kinds of other violence protection issues, I feel there is finally enough in the can to go ahead and talk about this over emphasized subject.  Now it's in the correct proportion to the other topics covered.  1/69th of effective self-defense is physical offense techniques!  LOL  Well, sort of.  Anyway, Charles is alone on this episode so brace yourselves for a lecture way over an hour again.  Charles reviews 12 physical tactics that can be used to cause emergency room level injuries to your assailant in order for you to escape or to stop the threat.  This episode goes very well with episode 028 in which we discuss Non-Combative Techniques, and episode 042 where we talk about defensive / protective techniques.  With the 028, 042, 069 episode combo, you should have generally all the techniques you will ever need... besides specialized scenarios.  So there you go all you technique fanatics out there.  Sorry, but in the scope of violence response training, physical techniques aren't that big in the picture.  And remember, your fighting spirit and righteous rage will determine about 60 to 70% of how effective your physical fighting back response will be.  only about a third of your physical response success is based on your knowledge and mastery of particular physical techniques.

Not all abusive partners have these signs, but most do.  And abusers don't need to have all of these characteristics either.
