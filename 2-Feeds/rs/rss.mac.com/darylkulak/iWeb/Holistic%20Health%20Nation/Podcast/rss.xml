<itunes:summary>Part 2 of our interview with Christopher Scipio, who is a holistic herpes specialist in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.  He gives us some more information about how to deal with herpes in a natural way. There is no cure for herpes, but there are definitely ways to reduce the symptoms without dangerous drugs.&#13;&#13;&#13;SPONSOR:  This podcast brought to you by the book “Health Insurance off the Grid,” your guide to affording the holistic lifestyle.&#13;&#13;Resources:&#13; Christopher Scipio’s Clinic - Naturopractica&#13; Christopher Scipio’s book “Making Peace With Herpes”&#13;  Christopher Scipio’s blog “Herpes Nation”&#13;  Ken Lay dies of stress - can we deny the mind-body connection any longer?  Ask your doctor why he is focusing on physical solutions only for heart attacks.  Obviously, the mind plays a part too.&#13;  Abraham Cherrix, a Virginia teen, is being forced to use chemotherapy for his cancer (Abraham’s Website, USA Today story, NewsTarget story)&#13;  We are moving from “male thinking” to “female thinking” in our healthcare.  Moving away from heroism, flashy technology to quiet therapies, caring for patients, low tech solutions.&#13;  Forty percent of bariatric surgery patients have complications within six months&#13;  2,000 hospitals have access to natural/organic food&#13;  Apple’s iTunes podcasting tutorials - great for newbie podcast listeners who aren’t familiar with how to listen to podcasts or organize them effectively&#13;  TV networks have their worst week in recorded history.  Where is everyone?  Well, it’s summer, but also people have migrated to cable channels, podcasts, video podcasts and YouTube.  Will we ever go back to network TV?
