<title>DISARMAMENT INSIGHT POD CASTS</title>
<link>http://web.mac.com/john_borrie/iWeb/Disarmament%20Insight%20pod%20cast%20site/Podcasts/Podcasts.html</link>
<description>As part of its work, Disarmament Insight is holding events throughout 2007 bringing together people from our target audiences in multilateral disarmament diplomacy.  &#13;The idea is to inspire them with some useful out-of-the-box perspectives and prompt them to discuss obstacles and challenges in human security-related work in new, more productive ways.&#13;We don’t report on the discussions between participants at those invitation-only events.  But we’re pod casting some of the presentations as we reckon they’re too good not to share.  Standard weasle-word disclaimers apply of course: what speakers say in their pod casts is their sole responsibility and doesn’t necessarily reflect the views or opinions of the United Nations, UNIDIR, Geneva Forum, their staff members or sponsors. &#13;With that out of the way, get prepared to be inspired too!&#13;If you like our pod casts, you can subscribe to download presentations as they become available by clicking on the ‘Subscribe’ link.</description>

But physics too has a long tradition of studying systems of many interacting components and has developed tools for understanding how such systems can generate collective behaviours that can't be anticipated by studying their components or their interactions in isolation. In this talk for Disarmament Insight on 25 September 2007, Dr. Philip Ball, author of the best-selling book "Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another", talks about the pros and cons of such approaches, and how arms control practitioners might benefit.
