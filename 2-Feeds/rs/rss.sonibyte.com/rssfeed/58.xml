					<itunes:author>NewPage Corporation</itunes:author>
					<itunes:subtitle>An interview with Maria Rodale of Rodale Inc.</itunes:subtitle>
					<itunes:summary>In this episode, Rodale shares her extensive research and family business&#39;s documented history as an organic pioneer, to illustrate why chemical-free farm systems are important to healthy environments and strong economies. 

?We?re not deciding for ourselves about the chemicals in our environment and in our bodies, unless we?re choosing organic,? Rodale states.

Understanding the relationship between the health of earth?s soil and people?s health is a part of the company?s rich history. Almost thirty years ago, Rodale?s father started a side-by-side comparison of organic versus chemical agriculture, entitled the Farming Systems Trial, the results of which garnered attention from scientists around the globe. 

?Organic farming is more productive, more profitable, more fuel efficient. And the surprise finding {from the Farming Systems Trial} was that organically farmed soil actually sequesters huge amounts of carbon, which means that it actually is one of the primary solutions to global warming.?</itunes:summary>

					<title>OnPaper Podcast-Skip Elliott of CSX</title>
					<link>http://aws.sonibyte.com/audio/OnPaper_PodcastSkip-5632.mp3</link>
					<itunes:author>NewPage Corporation</itunes:author>
					<itunes:subtitle>An interview with Skip Elliott of CSX.</itunes:subtitle>
					<itunes:summary>In this episode, Elliott shares how railroads are an energy efficient way to move goods on land, and offers listeners insight into how CSX has helped lead the industry in becoming the most environmentally-friendly transport option. In fact, according to CSX, trains can move a ton of freight more than 436 miles on a single gallon of fuel.

&quot;CSX is an important part of the sustainable supply chain,&quot; Elliott states. &quot;And as our customers and consumers in general are increasingly focused on the footprint of a product, the environmental advantage of shipping goods by rail is becoming even more apparent.&quot;

As a Charter Member of the EPA Smart Way Program and the first railroad to join the EPA&#39;s Climate Leaders Program, CSX is committed to developing long-term, comprehensive climate change strategies. In addition to inventorying its own greenhouse gas footprint, in 2008 CSX launched an online carbon calculator that calculates the carbon dioxide emissions savings of transporting freight by rail, thereby providing shippers and other interested parties the ability to select an environmentally sound shipping option among the many options available.

Additionally, since 2000, CSX has invested more than $1 billion to upgrade its locomotive fleet with technology that reduces both fuel consumption and air pollutant emissions. Through these efforts, the company has improved its fuel efficiency by approximately 90 percent since 1980.

Further demonstrating CSX&#39;s commitment to the environment, Elliott shares with On Paper listeners, &quot;As part of the Climate Leaders Program, CSX announced a plan to reduce the company&#39;s CO2 emission intensity by 8 percent by 2011. That&#39;s the equivalent of taking 441,000 cars off the road each year or burning almost six million fewer barrels of oil.&quot;</itunes:summary>

					<title>OnPaper Podcast-Jill Dumain of Patagonia</title>

					<itunes:author>NewPage Corporation</itunes:author>
					<itunes:subtitle>An interview with Jill Dumain of Patagonia.</itunes:subtitle>
					<itunes:summary>In this episode of On Paper, Dumain explains how Patagonia, a leading producer of quality outdoor clothing, uses business to inspire and implement solutions to the environmental crisis. Through participation in numerous organizations and industry efforts, Patagonia has collaborated with suppliers and competitors alike, to minimize the potential impact their worldwide supply chain and production practices could have on the earth.

&quot;We realize our company is much smaller than the people we have the potential to influence,&quot; explains Dumain. &quot;We have to influence companies larger than us if we are going to reach that ultimate goal.&quot;

As a founding member of the Organic Exchange, a business-to-business effort to stabilize the organic fiber market, Patagonia helped balance fiber supply with demand and as a result the Exchange is now examining the broader topic of sustainable textiles. And through participation in the Outdoor Industry Association&#39;s Eco-Working Group, Patagonia is helping to develop an eco-index for consumer products which will help outdoor companies, both large and small, measure where they are on the environmental impact scale, in turn offering guidance to make informed decisions regarding the production of their goods.

It is experiences like these, Dumain shares with On Paper, that have shown other companies the benefit of sharing environmental research, even with competitors.

&quot;We can work behind the scenes and share this information, that really is pre-competitive, and still compete on the merits of our design, durability, color, style,&quot; Dumain explains. &quot;It?s very powerful because it takes a lot of time to do environmental research and work. If you can share that with colleagues in other companies, everybody moves ahead so much faster.&quot;</itunes:summary>

					<itunes:summary>In this episode of On Paper, Chris Lloyd, Verizon&#39;s Executive Director of Public Policy and Strategic Alliances discusses Verizon?s involvement with the group Global e-Sustainability Initiative (GeSI). Lloyd outlines four areas where the group believes that information communication technology (ICT) can play a role in promoting more energy efficient behavior: using ICT and broadband to facilitate the development of smart grids, smart buildings, smart transportation and travel substitution.

&quot;The smart grid is going to deliver for electricity what the internet delivers for information,&quot; says Lloyd. &quot;We think by overlaying broadband and integrating it into the electric grid, it is going to make it a lot smarter.&quot; Lloyd further explains how communication technology and broadband technology combined in smart grids will provide consumers with demand side management information in order to make more energy efficient decisions in their household energy consumption.</itunes:summary>

Wasserman looks to three main areas to achieve these objectives: impact on communities; health, wellness and nutrition; and environmental impact.

&quot;When you look at the numbers, there is no bigger sector that has an impact on the planet and how people treat the planet, than the food and agriculture sector. And no bigger sector that has an impact on how people are going to use energy and interact with the climate then putting that together with facilities management sector,&quot; explains Wasserman.

					<itunes:author>NewPage Corporation</itunes:author>
					<itunes:subtitle>An interview with NewPage Corporation and World Resources Institute, from Fortune Brainstorm Green.</itunes:subtitle>
					<itunes:summary>In this episode of On Paper, Rick Willett, former President and CEO of NewPage Corporation and Craig Hanson, Director of People &amp; Ecosystems at the World Resources Institute, discuss the benefits of corporate - nonprofit partnerships, while outlining their current collaboration on Project POTICO (Palm Oil, Timber, Carbon Offsets). Project POTICO is a bold three-year, multi-million dollar initiative led by WRI and fully funded by NewPage Corporation to preserve endangered virgin rainforests in Indonesia, a region known for its high deforestation rate.

Project POTICO addresses the underlying economics of deforestation due to unsustainable palm oil cultivation. &quot;We are really supportive of long-term forest management,&quot; Willett explains. &quot;We have very good forestry practices in North America where the forests are well managed and are growing faster than they are being harvested. However, there are still issues internationally, and playing a role in having the world subscribe to a global standard for well managed forests is very important to our company, customers and employees.&quot;
