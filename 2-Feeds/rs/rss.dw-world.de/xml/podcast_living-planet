   <description>Biking around the world: our very own cross continental cyclist, London&#039;s Borris bikes, Bogota&#039;s Ciclovia, BASF&#039;s search for efficiency and Beijing&#039;s status envy are all in our look at international attitudes to cycling. We also hear reactions to the partial veto of Brazil&#039;s controversial forestry code.

Borris bikes impress LondonersLondon is the most recent city to introduce a program that&#039;s sweeping the world: the public bicycle scheme. Robin Powell reports on how it&#039;s been received, the bumps it&#039;s encountered and where it&#039;s going.

Bogota turns streets to parksThe Colombian capital of Bogotá is chaotic and chronically congested. Probably not the greatest place to ride a bicycle, but on a Sunday this metropolis of more than 8 million people is transformed.

Opposing logging turns deadly in CambodiaCambodians have been shocked in recent weeks by the killing of people protesting the destruction of the country&#039;s forests. Earlier this month a 14-year-old girl was shot dead as villagers demonstrated a notice to abandon their land. Her death followed the killing of one of Cambodia&#039;s most prominent activists in April, Chut Wutty, who was shot by a military policeman in mysterious circumstances.
	Report: Kyle James, Phnom Penh
Israelis and Arabs beat ammunition crates to owls&#039; homesOne of the problems faced by farmers the world over is mice. A conventional solution is to put down poison. In Israel, a better idea has emerged: barn owls, which eat the mice instead. Now the system is being trialed in Arab farms, but there&#039;s one inconvenient problem.
	Report:Iris Makler, Isreal
Hanging on to coracles in WalesWhen the Romans invaded Britain 2000 years ago, they were impressed by a small, simple water craft used by the Celts - particularly in Wales - to get across fast-flowing rivers. So effective was the original model that the coracle remains little changed since ancient times. Sian Griffiths braved rains and flood warnings in Carmarthen in West Wales to learn more.
	Report: Sian Griffiths, Carmarthen, Wales

	
	 

	 

	 

	 
What robots can do for electric carsPrice is one of the main reasons why many car-buyers have not made the leap to electric cars yet, as well as anxiety about range and where to recharge. Scientists at Munich&#039;s robotics expo, Automatica, believe that robots might hold the key to improving the outlook for these vehicles.

Catching bats and their virusesVirologists in Germany recently discovered that bats carry a far wider spectrum of viruses than previously assumed. So are we underestimating their role as a trigger for disease outbreaks among humans? DW speaks to researchers behind the study and goes on a bat capture.
	Report: Sonya Diehn
Gigaton gap grows at climate talksWith the UN&#039;s climate chief warning that current pledges to tackle global warming are pointing to a world hotter by 2.5 to 5 degrees Celsius, negotiations to limit climate change remain as daunting as ever. DW speaks to some of the experts involved in the challenge of adapting to a hotter planet.
	Report:Irene Quaile
Italy&#039;s dying breed of wild-mussel diversWhile Mediterranean mussels are nowadays mostly farmed, the little bay of Portonovo is a unique place where fishermen are still licensed to dive and hand-collect wild mussels. The tradition of mussel-diving is at risk of disappearing, but it’s not because supplies are running out.
	Report: Dany Mitzman, Portonovo
Ukraine&#039;s wolfmanA profile of Sergei Zhyli, a Ukrainian ecologist who has lived with wolves, mimicking their behavior, eating their food and even raising three pups on his own. His views on hunting have rendered him a lone wolf among the country&#039;s conservationists.

Europeans stress-test their treesWe use wood for just about everything, but as climate changes, so too change habitats for timber forests. In the first project of its kind, a scheme called Reinforce is trying to discover which trees are going to provide Europe with a steady supply of timber this century.
	Report: Robin Powell, Westonbirt, UK
Grannies knit for the planetWebsites like Etsy and DaWanda have propelled a huge revival in hand-made products. Grannies, Inc. is a similar, socially-conscious start-up. It&#039;s an online knitwear company where customers can design their own beanies, scarves and wrist warmers, and have them knitted by a grandma of their choice.
	Report:Cinnamon Nippard, Berlin

	 

	 

	 

	 
Off the grid with the WelkesNot many people have the opportunity to make all the energy they need for their own home and transport. For 42-year-old Jörg Welke, it&#039;s a dream come true. At least until the end of the year. He and his family are guinea pigs in a social experiment. They&#039;re trialing life in a super-efficient house.

India&#039;s problem with &#039;manual scavenging&#039;Some jobs are just so disgusting that most governments around the world have banned people from doing them. In India there&#039;s a trade that, despite bans, just won’t go away. It&#039;s called manual scavenging, which is a euphemism for hand-collecting other household&#039;s feces.

A Great Green Wall to halt the SaharaIn the West African nation of Senegal, an audacious project is underway to create a vast forest across the African continent. It&#039;s known as the Great Green Wall. The idea is to plant a belt of trees to stop the southern advance of the Sahara Desert.
	Report: Bobby Bascombe, Senegal (courtesy of PRI)
	 
&#039;Trashy Bags&#039; tackles Ghana&#039;s plastic problemBuying water in plastic sachets has become increasingly popular in West Africa in recent years. The half-liter translucent bags are seen as cheap and clean. But the makeshift solution to a water problem has created a huge trash problem, especially in the Ghanaian capital, Accra.
	Report: Vanessa Hermann, Hervé Gogoua (voiced: Joanna Impey)
One man&#039;s campaign to save the snow leopardRodney Jackson is one of the world’s foremost authorities on the elusive snow leopard, which lives on some of the earth’s highest mountain peaks in Nepal, Pakistan, India, Siberia, Mongolia and Tibet. Jackson’s relentless efforts over the past thirty-five years are credited with bringing back the snow leopard from the brink of extinction.

   <description>Dirty deeds: we visit some spills, old and new. We hear from the gas leak off Scotland; Amnesty hurls fresh allegations at Shell over its behavior in the Niger Delta; Ecuador presses ahead with its initiative to avoid drilling in its Yasuni national park; and the fuss over dredging the Elbe.

Total leak suggests lessons for industryTotal has been unable to plug the leak at its Elgin platform off the coast of Scotland since an accident on the 25th of March. The leak triggered an evacuation and fears surrounding a gas cloud at the site. Scientific assessments suggest little impact on the environment so far, but that&#039;s not the only concern for some.
	Report: Peter Shevlin, Aberdeen
Amnesty accuses Shell of masking Nigerian spillsThis week, the human rights organization Amnesty International took aim at Shell for its record in Nigeria&#039;s Niger Delta region. Amnesty says it has evidence that Shell strongly underreported a major oil spill there in 2008. DW spoke to Amnesty&#039;s Director of Global Issues, Audrey Gaughan, about the claims.
	Interview: Audrey Gaughan / Nathan Witkop
Plans to dredge the Elbe anger farmersGermany&#039;s northern states recently approved a deepening of the Elbe River. It will be the ninth time it has been dredged since the early 19th Century. This will free ships with a draught of 14.5 meters to reach Hamburg&#039;s port. But farmers and environmental groups are resisting the move.
	Report: Julian Bohne, Hamburg

	 

	 

	 

	 
Ecuador presses ahead with Yasuni initiativeIn September we reported how Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa delivered a novel ultimatum to the UN General Assembly: raise $100 million by the end of the year, or we&#039;ll be forced to exploit the oil beneath our national park. The idea is to compensate countries for the environmental services that they are providing for everyone on Earth. We hear where things stand.

UK wind farms compete with bogsIn Scotland, great swathes of peatland habitat are being used to build wind farms. Yet peatlands are a natural sink for carbon dioxide, and when they dry, they release it. Are some of the UK&#039;s wind farms counterproductive?  The Carbon Payback Calculator hopes to deliver the answer.
	Report: Peter Shevlin, Glasgow
What&#039;s in BP&#039;s fines for Louisiana&#039;s womenTwo years ago this week, an explosion on BP&#039;s Deepwater Horizon platform in the Gulf of Mexico set in motion one of the world&#039;s largest oil spills to date. BP faces billions of dollars in fines. Some see the money as an opportunity to heal not just the environment, but Louisiana&#039;s appalling wage gap between men and women.
	Report: Zoe Sullivan, New Orleans
The WWF hunts for trouble in BotswanaSpain&#039;s King Juan Carlos, honorary president of WWF&#039;s Spanish chapter, made headlines this week when he injured himself in Botswana on a trip to hunt elephants. The revelations have sparked debate about the image of the WWF and whether elephant-hunting can be justified for conservation.
	Report: Irene Quaile
A mystery illness plagues Galapagos sea lionsThe Galapagos Islands are best known as a seminal stopping point for the young Charles Darwin on the journey that led him to the theory of evolution. Home to many unique animals, the Galapagos remain a focus for science. Today, tourists can enjoy the playful sea lions, but the mammals appear to be under siege.

Eager beavers save Ukraine&#039;s peatlandsThe draining and burning of peat bogs may account for up to 6 percent of manmade greenhouse gas emissions, according to a recent UN report. A project in Ukraine is looking to flood and restore thousands of hectares to their natural state.
	Report: Saroja Coelho, Polisia, Ukraine

The sun dims for Germany&#039;s solar subsidiesLast year Germany installed a whopping 7.5 gigawatts of new solar panels. For a country with a third of the sunlight of Spain, the solar industry is booming. Or perhaps bubbling, say its critics. Amid a raft of bankruptcies due to competition and reductions to incentives, is the sun rising or setting on Germany&#039;s solar experiment?
	Report: Jonathan Gifford, Berlin
Coating promises to improve solar panelsLatvia might not spring to mind as a hub for solar technology, but the small Baltic nation may have come up with a technology that could boost solar panel&#039;s efficiency considerably.
	Report:  Ģederts Ģelzis, Riga
La Nina takes toll on ParaguayIn Paraguay, people are suffering from a severe drought. The country is the hardest hit by La Nina in Latin America. Thousands of small farmers’ livelihoods have been affected across the country.
	Report: Sam Cowie, Asuncion
Cost of extreme weather risesLast year was an especially bad year for weather extremes like the drought in Latin America. Reinsurance companies – the companies that insure the insurance industry – have a big stake in keeping track of natural disasters, and they say weather extremes are taking up a growing share of their payouts.
	Report: Fabian Schmidt (presented by Kate Laycock)
Earth Hour from BerlinLast weekend saw millions of people around the world turn off their lights for a symbolic moment. Since 2007, Earth Hour has spread around the world, drawing millions of participants from dozens of countries.

Stuttgart begins powering cars with food wasteA recent study found that Germans throw away an incredible 11 million kilos of food a year. While much of this is turned into compost, German researchers in Stuttgart are trying to find another use for this organic matter. They want to take biowaste from the fruit and vegetable market to power cars with natural gas.
	Report: Kate Hairsine, Stuttgart
Improving European recycling ratesThis week, official figures showed that 25 billion glass bottles and jars were collected for recycling in the EU in 2010, the latest year for available data. That meant glass recycling rates held steady at around 68 percent, according to the European Container Glass Federation. But recycling figures for other waste are much lower. DW spoke to participants of a project aiming to change this.
	Report: Julian Bohne, Hamburg
Dennis Buchmann sticks a face on meatMost of us don&#039;t see the fields where vegetables are grown or the conditions in which animals live before they&#039;re rendered into shrink-wrapped packets of meat in the supermarket. Dennis Buchmann wants to tackle this disconnection. A meat-eater, concerned about animal welfare, his idea is MeineKleineFarm - which means my small farm. He draws attention to meat by giving it a face.
	Report: Cinnamon Nippard, Berlin
&#039;Planet under Pressure&#039; greets AnthropoceneThis week more than 2,800 experts from around the world gathered in London for yet another large environmental conference. The Planet under Pressure meeting aired a slew of proposals and warnings all aimed at steering the direction of this year&#039;s 20-year follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit.
	Report: Robin Powell, London
An interview on reshaping the UNEven to people who don&#039;t track these things closely, it&#039;s clear that two decades of United Nations climate talks have achieved very little. One of the policy briefs presented in London proposes ambitious reforms for international bodies like the UN and World Trade Organisation, to equip them for the 21st century.

   <description>The contractors who work in the radioactive areas of France&#039;s nuclear power plants have banded together to fight for safer working conditions; skiers and wildlife share the mountain at a ski resort in Vermont; an OECD report predicts a bleak future for the planet unless we change our consumption habits; and activists try to revive a dead river in Sao Paolo. French nuclear workers fight for safer working conditionsIn France, they&#039;re known as nuclear nomads: the contractors who work in radioactive areas of nuclear plants. They&#039;re underpaid for the dirty work they do, and often operate in dangerous conditions. Now they&#039;ve formed and association and some are even suing over alleged workplace violations.
	Report: Suzanne Krause / Dagmar Breitenbach
A ski resort goes greenAlpine ski resorts are not known for being particularly environmentally friendly. Trees are cut down to make wide runs, energy is used for the lifts and artificial snow is produced to keep the slopes covered when the weather isn&#039;t cooperating. But there&#039;s one ski resort in Vermont in the US that&#039;s taken a different route. Kateri Jochum strapped on her skis to take a tour.
	Report: Kateri Jochum
OECD paints bleak picture with 2050 predictionsA new report by the OECD predicts a massive population and a growing economy that will put a lot of pressure on the world&#039;s resources and ecosystems. The organization&#039;s Environmental Outlook to 2050 warns that the pressure may simply be too much.
	Report: Richard Fuchs
Activists try to revive a dead river in Sao PaoloBrazil&#039;s Tiete River turns into an open sewage once it reaches the city of Sao Paulo and has become a symbol of poor water management in the developing world. But some activists are stepping up and try to bring the river back to life.

Germany aims to double its resource efficiencyEnergy is frequently in the news these days. Germany in particular has been getting a lot of press for its efforts to switch mostly to renewables. Something that hasn&#039;t been getting that much attention is another environmentally friendly plan, a new attempt to slash the country&#039;s resource consumption.
	Report: Andre Leslie
Liberia&#039;s for-profit recycling centreIn Liberia, electronic waste, frequently from Europe, is strewn on the streets, the swamps and the forests. One young man has an entrepreneurial idea. He runs Liberia&#039;s first recycling centre, at the back of a busy, bustling market.
	Report: Tamasin Ford

	 

	 

	 

	 
Colombia&#039;s tire-cookerEvery year, four and a half million tires are consumed in Colombia. That means that tires, upon tires, upon tires, end up in landfills where they refuse to decompose. Or, they&#039;re burned and release toxic gases. It’s an environmental problem around the world, but one Colombian thinks he has a solution.
	Report: Nadja Drost

	 

	 

	 

	 
Canada pressures the EU over tar sandsBy June, the European Union is due to decide how to handle oil imports coming from tar sands in Canada.  The fuel’s carbon footprint is the subject of dramatic debate in Canada, with scientists, politicians and indigenous groups battling back and forth. The fight has now moved to Europe as the fuel&#039;s status becomes the focus of a bitter lobbying tussle between Canada and environmental groups.
	Report: Teri Schultz
The unlikely maker of the world&#039;s greenest fridgeThe tiny land-locked Southern African country Swaziland is the unlikely manufacturer of a new generation of clean refrigerators. A local company, together with a coalition of European backers, has come up with a low-tech fridge that promises to free rural Africans from a dependence on kerosene-powered-coolers.

   <link>http://www.dw.de/dw/episode/0,,15696399,00.html?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss</link>
   <description>Law and the environment – we speak to environmental lawyer and ClientEarth CEO, James Thornton; Germany&#039;s environmental zones and air pollution; the EU drums up support for its energy roadmap for 2050; and we hear about greening up music festivals.
German air pollution rises despite green zonesSince 2008, environmental zones in Germany have restricted where heavily polluting cars can drive, yet air pollution levels are higher than before the scheme began.
	Cars in Germany are required to display a sticker identifying how much particulate pollution the vehicle pumps out. The stickers are colour coded red through to green. Without a sticker, drivers face fines for entering any of the country&#039;s environment zones. Yet this week, Germany&#039;s Federal Environment Agency came out with some disappointing news for efforts to curb air pollution. 

	Report: Andre Leslie
Suing for the environmentJames Thornton can claim to have sued the UK out of building new coal plants.
	James Thornton is a lawyer and CEO of ClientEarth, a non-profit organization that campaigns for better environmental laws. In the eighties, hehelped sue the Reagan administration into enforcing the Clean Water act and today his organization conducts similar campaigns in Europe. We began by asking him why the earth should need legal representation.

	Interview: James Thornton / Nathan Witkop
EU touts benefits of energy roadmapSenior European Union leaders said this week that nearly eliminating carbon emissions from Europe&#039;s energy by the middle of the century may work out to be little more expensive than sticking to fossil fuels.
	This week EU leaders met with energy industry figures, civil society groups and academics in Brussels to build support for the bloc&#039;s 2050 Energy Roadmap.

	Report: Christoph Hasselbach (Sean Sinico)
Greening up music festivalsEvery year across Europe, music festivals attract tens of thousands of revelers. Meeting these visitors&#039; food, waste, accommodation and energy needs is no small task.
	Festivals can take on the proportions of a small city, as can their environmental impact. In recent years, there&#039;s been a push among organizers to reduce their events&#039; footprints. Even big-name festivals like Lollapalooza in the United States are trying to make a difference. Our correspondent speaks to two event planners about sharing solutions.

   <description>We hear from a push in Hamburg to tackle cruise ships&#039; port-based soot emissions; plans for Europe&#039;s biggest gold mine divide a small town in Romania; an energy austerity drive gathers support amid campaigning for France&#039;s presidential elections; and tsunami tourism in Aceh.You can listen to the show online or subscribe to Living Planet as a podcast. Click on the links below for the individual items.Hamburg wrestles with increasing cruise ship pollutionEnvironmental groups have long criticized the shipping industry for the pollution it creates – both at sea and in port.In port, cruise ships still need to run their engines to maintain electricity for what sometimes amounts to a small city on board. With the number of vessels visiting Hamburg expected to grow from 100 to 150 this year, pollution is becoming a problem. A campaign is underway to stop cruisers from running their engines while moored, but the challenge is proving difficult. 
Report: Julian Bohne, HamburgMassive gold mine plans divide Romanian townThe Romanian village of Rosia Montana has just 3,000 residents, but could be set to become the largest gold mine in Europe.Preparations for the project go back at least 10 years. In that time, it has divided locals into two opposing camps: those who support the mine and those who fear it will destroy the area&#039;s tourist potential and archaeological remains. 

Report: Tom Wilson, Rosia Montana, RomaniaFrench energy austerity drive gathers supportAs France prepares for presidential elections in April, a team of energy experts, engineers and architects sense an opportunity to get their agenda on the national agenda.In the wake of last year&#039;s Fukushima disaster, NegaWatt is pushing to liberate France of nuclear power by 2050. Its appeal to energy austerity is attracting attention from left to right.

Around half of the 230,000 people who died in the disaster came from this part of Indonesia. The area holds a terrible fascination for many and today growing numbers of tourists are coming to the province to see for themselves the relics of destruction.

   <title>Living Planet: Fracking in the US and Europe</title>
   <link>http://www.dw.de/dw/episode/0,,15598890,00.html?maca=en-podcast_living-planet-948-xml-mrss</link>
   <description>This week we look at two examples of fracking in the US and Europe; as South Sudan and its northern neighbor resume revenue-sharing talks, we look at the role of oil in their conflict; and a molecule to cool the planet – is its recent discovery good news for the climate?You can listen to the show online or subscribe to Living Planet as a podcast. Click on the links below for the individual items.Oil&#039;s role in SudanThis week Sudan and South Sudan resumed talks on sharing the proceeds of oil revenues.After decades of intermittent war, South Sudan gained formal independence from its northern neighbor last year. It inherited most of Sudan&#039;s oil, but it&#039;s not clear how the two countries should split the revenues. Many observers fear that if a fair and transparent agreement isn&#039;t reached soon, the two sides are destined to resume fighting. DW asked Dana Wilkins from the campaign group Global Witness, which focuses on corruption in extractive industries, to lay out the problem. 
Interview: Dana Wilkins / Nathan WitkopFracking faces tighter controls in USWith the dangers of nuclear power playing out in Japan, tensions in the Middle East pushing up oil prices, and climate scientists arguing for the phase out of coal, the United States is desperate for some energy alternatives.One that has seemed promising in recent years is natural gas, which burns more cleanly than coal. With demand for gas driving up the price, hard to reach deposits have become lucrative. And that has led to a boom in &quot;fracking&quot; to get to them. It&#039;s a technique whose proponents say is vital for cleaner, stable energy and whose detractors say is an environmental and health risk. 

Report: Sandy Hausman, Southwest VirginiaAustrians say they can do &#039;clean&#039; frackingIt&#039;s not just North Americans who are keen on fracking. There&#039;s a boom in the technique happening around the world.
Here in Europe, many countries are concerned about the reliability of the region&#039;s main gas supplier, Russia, and fracking allows them to reconsider their own real estate for previously useless deposits. In Austria, proponents claim to have developed a cleaner method of fracking, but it still divides the community. 

Report: Kerry Skyring, HerrnbaumgartenA molecule to cool the planetCould the planet be working harder than previously thought to naturally mitigate climate change?It&#039;s a question that&#039;s intriguing an international research team, which recently discovered a molecule first hypothesized in the 1950s. The naturally occurring compound is part of a class of molecules that help break down pollution and turn it – eventually – into clouds that may help cool the planet. To find out more about the discovery – published in Science magazine last week – we spoke to one of the researchers on the project.

Click on the links below for the individual items.Aviation&#039;s problem with Europe&#039;s carbon tradeThe European Union&#039;s emissions trading scheme (ETS) was extended to aviation on January 1 in the face of intense opposition from foreign and domestic carriers. So does the EU&#039;s resolve make a global deal more, or less, likely?Europe&#039;s carbon market is the biggest in the world. It was introduced in 2005, but starting this year it was extended to air travel for the first time. Any airline taking off or landing in a European airport will need to account for at least part of that journey&#039;s emissions on the ETS. It&#039;s not just foreign airlines that are upset. European carriers are also dissatisfied. We take a look at some of the competing concerns. 

Reporting: Nathan Witkop, Holly FoxInterviewees: Andreas Bartels; Ulrich Schulte-Strathaus; Bill HemmingsWhat&#039;s driving a spike in shark attacks?A spate of lethal shark attacks in Western Australia has provoked fears and questions among locals and tourists alike. Though shark sightings are common in Australia, deaths are rare.On average, about one person has died of shark attack in Australia each year for the past 50 years. But in Western Australia, four people have died in the last 18 months. The government there recently approved millions of dollars for safety programs. DW went to the beach to look behind the attacks.

   <description>Looking back at 2011: Japan&#039;s Fukushima nuclear disaster; Germany to phase out nuclear energy; smart grids necessary to handle renewables; France fights over its controversial nuclear power plant in Fessenheim; concerns about methane plague Brazil&#039;s Belo Monte dam; Europe&#039;s emissions trading scheme upsets air carriers.You can listen to the show online or subscribe to Living Planet as a podcast. Click on the links below for the individual items. Nuclear safety expert looks at Japan&#039;s Fukushima nuclear disasterJapan&#039;s Fukushima nuclear crisis began with a magnitude 9 earthquake that unleashed an enormous Tsunami on March 11. Three reactors at the plant suffered meltdowns.It was only in December that Japan&#039;s government said the reactors had reached a state of &quot;cold shutdown.&quot; Lothar Hahn, former head of GRS, an agency which briefs the German government on nuclear safety talked about when the Japanese crisis began. 

Interview: Nathan WitkopGerman Chancellor Merkel does away with nuclear energyWhen Japan&#039;s nuclear crisis began, people in Germany immediately drew parallels with the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union. People&#039;s support for nuclear energy plummeted.Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had just extended the lifespan of nuclear plants, buckled under the pressure. She announced a surprise freeze in the policy.

Report: Ben Knight Smart grids are crucial to handle renewables&#039; fluctuating supply, experts sayToday, renewables supply around 20 percent of electricity in Germany. But there&#039;s a downside to using renewable energy: it&#039;s the fluctuating supply.To offset this, supporters say governments need to invest in &#039;smart grids.&#039; Professor Olav Hohmeyer, an energy advisor to the German government explained why it&#039;s crucial to build smart grids.

Interview: Nathan WitkopFight over France&#039;s most controversial nuclear power plant in Fessenheim heats upFrance is more dependent on nuclear energy than any other country. But things might be about to change.This year, the country&#039;s opposition forged an alliance to scale down France&#039;s reliance on nuclear power. Meanwhile, President Sarkozy&#039;s administration has left open the possibility of shutting down the country&#039;s oldest reactor, Fessenheim, when the results of a &#039;stress test&#039; are released in January. 

Report: Diana Fong, Fessenheim, FranceConcerns about methane plague Brazil&#039;s Belo Monte damFukushima may have made 2011 a transformative year for energy – how we make it, its impact on us and the world around us. But it&#039;s not just Europeans who have been reviewing their energy choices.Brazil gets most of its energy from a renewable source – hydroelectric dams. This year it approved a massive new project: the Belo Monte dam on the Xingu River in the northern state of Para. 

Report: Jon Beaupre, Altamira, Brazil / Claes Andreasson Europe&#039;s emissions trading scheme upsets international air carriersOn January 1, Europe&#039;s emissions trading scheme is set to be extended to the aviation industry. Airlines using terminals in the EU will have to offset at least part of its emissions.International carriers are angry, but it seems they will have to comply. Last week the EU&#039;s top court threw out a legal challenge launched by US airlines. Back in September, Teri Schultz covered the show down between carriers and legislators.

On the one hand, potential oil revenues dwarf Uganda&#039;s national debt. On the other hand, from Nigeria to Sudan there are plenty of examples of countries where oil hasn&#039;t served as a silver bullet for development.

Scientists make a breakthrough in predicting earthquakesA team of American scientists has made a discovery that could identify an imminent quake.From hurricanes to volcanoes and even Tsunamis, humans have made great strides in developing early warning systems for deadly natural phenomena. Earthquakes are another matter, but that may be about to change.

Report: Nik Martin, UKTaipei 101 aims to be the world&#039;s tallest &#039;green&#039; buildingThough Taiwan may be better known for its rapid growth than its environmental credentials, the island has a new monument to sustainability.Nearly 40 percent of the world&#039;s energy ends up being consumed in buildings. So making them more efficient could lead to substantial savings for the environment and companies&#039; energy bills.
