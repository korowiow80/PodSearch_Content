 <title>Krynoid Podcast 030: The Romans</title>
 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/54</link>
 <description>&quot;Close your eyes and Nero will give you a big surprise!&quot;

Yes, Jim and Martin decide whether it&#039;s thumbs up or thumbs down for the second season sand &amp; sandals epic, The Romans, featuring a doddery old codger with a lyre (and Maximus Petullian of Corinth).
 
All Roman life is here - lions, gladiators, a shipwrecked galley, a poisoned chalice and a lecherous lunatic of an Emperor.

The Doctor plays air lyre, Vicki giggles and Ian and Babs get (possibly) post-coital. Oh well, when in Rome...

 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/53</link>
 <description>“It&#039;s what you wunted, isn&#039;t it?”

Yes, the dulcit tones and unusual pronunciation of nobody’s favourite companion, Adric. Loathe him or loathe him, the young Alzarian first appeared on our screens in Full Circle and here Jim and Martin sift through the wreckage.

This Season 18 classic features some dithering old men, a mysterious scab, unscripted animated corpses, (literally) intrusive camera work and The Long Walk of Login. What is the secret of the Marshmen? Who is The Rani’s toy boy? And will Romana ever rid herself of her embarrassing and unsightly veins?

For all this and significantly less, listen now!

&lt;!--break--&gt;
In the latest Krynoid Podcast, Jim and Martin cast their peepers over this Peter Davison 2-parter and ponder the provenance of Anthony Ainley&#039;s accent, worry about Kamelion&#039;s head falling off and groove to the crazy disco sounds of King John and his Lovely Lute.
&lt;!--break--&gt;
The Doctor has a sword fight, Tegan moans about the cold and Turlough looks out of a window. Unmissable stuff.

And Dr Phill from the Adventures in Time, Space and Music podcast joins us to provide some welcome professionalism.

 <description>&quot;Klokleda partha menin klatch,haroon haroon haroon,Klokleda sheenah tierra natch,haroon haroon haroon,

What&#039;s all that about then? It&#039;s the Venusian lullaby from The Curse of Peladon of course. In the latest Krynoid Podcast Jim and Martin take a look at this 1972 Pertwee 4-parter where the third Doctor gets a rare foray off Earth to help a mini-skirted King bring his world out of the dark ages despite the best efforts of his troublesome High Priest.

There&#039;s alien creatures galore including the return of the Ice Warriors, the mighty (or not so mighty) Aggedor, a goggle-eyed bogey in a jar... and then there&#039;s Alpha Centauri who I can&#039;t describe here as it may offend.

 <description>&quot;I&#039;m Romanadvoratrelunder&quot; &quot;I&#039;m so sorry, is there anything we can do?&quot;

Jim and Martin are back and this time they take a look at The Ribos Operation, the 1978 Robert Holmes story that kicked off the Key to Time season.

In this one we get to see a mad old antler-wearing crone, a giant rubber lizard, a toothless heretic and a pair of galactic conmen attempting to sell a planet to a ranting nobleman. Tom Baker plays it for laughs with varying success and we&#039;re introduced to a new assistant - the Doctor&#039;s not impressed but your hosts most certainly are!

Any good? Well for once there is disagreement, but which one of us is right? Listen in and make your own minds up.

 <title>Krynoid Podcast 024: Resurrection of the Daleks</title>
 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/48</link>
 <description>&quot;Hello boys. Just in time for the fun!&quot;

This time around Jim and Martin give the Krynoid treatment to Peter Davison&#039;s 1984 outing Resurrection of the Daleks. Yes, those dreaded pepperpots are back, this time looking for help from their creator, but Davros isn&#039;t playing ball.

Listen in as we solve the problem of the disappearing Dalek, discuss the (in)competence of a certain mechanical engineer, consider the toilet habits of Rodney Bewes and try to make sense of a convoluted and hole-ridden plot. Oh, and there&#039;s some hilarious death scenes as well...lots of them.

Oh, and there&#039;s some hilarious death scenes as well...lots of them.

 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/47</link>
 <description>&quot;Gentlemen, I&#039;ve got news for you. This lighthouse is under attack and by morning we might all be dead. Anyone interested?&quot;

Here we go again. This time it&#039;s back to 1977 for the Tom Baker classic Horror of Fang Rock. It&#039;s dark, it&#039;s cold, it&#039;s foggy and there&#039;s a green pulsating blob on the rampage intent on electrifying everyone in its path! Not a good day to be a lighthouse keeper.

But is the story any good? You betcha! Join us and we&#039;ll tell you why.

 <description>&quot;Geniussssss!&quot;

Jim and Martin take on the 1969 Pat Troughton 6-parter The Seeds of Death, where they discover a plot by the Ice Warriors to terraform the Earth by sending deadly seedpods from the Moon. 

It&#039;s the future and not only do we have T-MAT, enabling instantaneous movement around the world, but fashion has evolved and everyone is wearing polyester jumpsuits with their pants on the outside!
Oh, and we can control world weather using 4 levers labelled &#039;Dry&#039;.

There&#039;s also a lot of lumbering about, a lot of hissing and a heck of a lot of foam!

 <title>Krynoid Podcast 021: Time and the Rani</title>
 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/45</link>
 <description>&quot;I&#039;ve had enough of this drivel!&quot;

Yes, it&#039;s the one you&#039;ve all been waiting for. Jim and Martin cast their collective eyes over the much-maligned Sylvester McCoy premiere, Time and the Rani. 

It&#039;s a story of kidnapped geniuses, very heavy asteroids, repressed aliens and a big secret behind a locked door. All this and some of the best effects ever seen in classic Who!

Unfortunately it also features a rubbish regeneration, a big wobbly brain, some dreadful acting and two versions of Mel (three if you count the hologram).

But is it really as bad as everyone says it is? Well, there is a short answer to that question but why not listen to us ramble on about it for a couple of hours before we reach the inevitable conclusion.</description>

 <title>Krynoid Podcast 020: The Time Warrior</title>
 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/44</link>
 <description>&quot;Waaaaauughhhh...MICE!&quot;

Jim and Martin put Time and the Rani on hold and instead take a look at something good - the 1973/74 Jon Pertwee season 11 opener, The Time Warrior.

It&#039;s a medieval tale of a toad-faced alien warrior and a war-mongering, wine-swilling robber baron with time travel and Dot Cotton thrown into the mix. Not only the first Sontaran story, but also the first time the Doctor&#039;s home planet is named. And, of course, it features the first appearance of the wonderful Elizabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith.

Join us as we salute Liz and discover whether or not her first story is up to scratch.</description>

Well, the new Matt Smith series is upon us and, never ones to be accused of having their fingers on the pulse, Jim and Martin head back to 1964 to take a look at the William Hartnell classic, The Keys of Marinus! Along the way they discover google-eyed brains in jars, a trouserless young man, a sex-starved hunter and clumsy flipper-footed villains.

Can the Doctor and friends find the five keys and restore order to Marinus or will the evil Yartek get his hands on them? Can William Hartnell remember his lines? And just what is inside those wetsuits? Join us to find out...</description>

And what a tale it is, featuring as it does Home Counties bumpkins, a Rickmansworth quarry and a selection of blobby Soup Dragon impersonators.

 <description>Why could a pig never become a sailor? He can&#039;t look aloft! 

What are we on about? It&#039;s the 1983 Peter Davison story Enlightenment of course, the subject of the latest Krynoid Podcast. Jim and Martin take a long look back at this twentieth anniversary tale which not only features the hilarious joke above but also draws to a close the Black Guardian trilogy of stories.

Why not have a listen as we discuss an Eternal who is infatuated with Tegan (as were we!), some rather good / pretty poor model work (depending on who you believe), a pantomime performance from Nurse Gladys Emmanuel, and just who is the best Davison companion?

But to top it all there is the first and last acting performance of Leee John, legendary vocalist of 80s pop band Imagination. Oh dear...</description>

 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/37</link>
 <description>It is a fat Controller!

Jim and Martin head back to 1985 to take a look at Colin Baker&#039;s second outing, Attack of the Cybermen - a violent tale involving comets, diamond heists and time travel. And behind it all is a big fat man in a garish costume - no, not the sixth Doctor, we do of course mean the Cyber Controller.

There&#039;s also plenty of blasts from the past with a visit to a certain junkyard, the recurring character of Lytton and you&#039;d better know your Cyber history or you may be scratching your head through the second episode.

But is it a classic or a clanger? Come inside and find out...

 <title>Krynoid Podcast 014: The Seeds of Doom</title>
 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/36</link>
 <description>It&#039;s time to play in the green cathedral!

Jim and Martin tackle a real gem and the story that spawned this very podcast. Yes, it&#039;s the 1976 Tom Baker classic The Seeds of Doom!

The Doctor visits the South Pole in just his hat and scarf and runs into Boycie who&#039;s there to nick an intergalactic vegetable for his loonie employer. Much violence and fisty-cuffs later the vegetable is the size of a house! Aided by a cross-eyed old bint (that&#039;s Amelia Ducart not Sarah-Jane) the Doctor attempts to save the day once again. Will he succeed? Well of course he will, but tune in any way and we&#039;ll talk you through it.

 <title>Krynoid Podcast 012 The War Machines</title>
 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/34</link>
 <description>Doctor Who is required! Yes, Jim and Martin head back to 1966 and give you the lowdown on William Hartnell story The War Machines.

We investigate the strange scent eminating from the Post Office Tower and discuss the incredible ability the War Machines have to knock over packing crates! We see two new companions join the show as the current one disappears half way through the story! What&#039;s more, there&#039;s a tramp who seems to be auditioning for a part in Oliver the musical and the lead actor seems to be working from a different script to everyone else! 

Can Doctor Who save the day? Tune in and find out...

 <title>Krynoid Podcast 011 Spearhead from Space</title>
 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/32</link>
 <description>Destroy! Total destruction!

Jim and Martin turn their attention towards the 1970 Jon Pertwee classic Spearhead from Space. 
Not only the first story for the third Doctor, this is the very first story to be filmed in colour, the only story to be shot on film, and introduces the Autons to an unsuspecting public!

But is it any good? Well, you&#039;ll have to listen to find out our views on plastic-faced secretaries, a naked Doctor sporting a tattoo, giant rubbery tentacles and of course those boiler-suited, scarf-wearing killer Autons!

 <link>http://krynoidpodcast.jellycast.com/node/10</link>
 <description>Happy Easter!

This time Jim and Martin delve into the murky, black and white (but mostly white) world of The Mind Robber - the classic 1968 Patrick Troughton story of Greek Myths, off-white robots and somewhat-less-than-super heroes.

We discuss repetition, Scottish clan identification, repetition, mercifully-absent elephants, repetition, Rapunzel&#039;s range of hair products, repetition and how VidFIRE stops Jim feeling sick. Oh, and repetition.
