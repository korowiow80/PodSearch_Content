            <link><![CDATA[http://joebeta.libsyn.com/pgr115_what_we_talkin_about]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Preheat your oven to 410 and put Episode 115 of the Post Game Report in for approximately 60 minutes. This is a treat that takes some time. Phoenix410, your Iron Chef this week is joined by SugarFree, HeroicSuperman and Talking About Gamers co-host Robbiejo for a podcasting treat. We tried to get HeroicSuperman to open up about Kayne and Lynch 2 and Mafia 2 but he wasn't feeling particularly motivated by the content of the games to really talk about it at length. What follows after the mediocre sequel talk is a genuine conversation about the state of the PlayStation Move and Microsoft's Kinect.</p>
<p>To close the show, we do our best impression of Podtacular and talk an awful lot about Halo: Reach and the overall Halo Universe.</p>
<p>Serve this episode up with a fine wine (or a glass of water if you're underage) and enjoy.</p>

Without JVB and HeroicSuperman by our sides, we called in Peterocc from Gamertag Radio to fill the void. Believe it or not, we had a 25 minute discussion that started with Soldier's opinion of the Kayne and Lynch 2 demo. We also spend a lot of time talking about the total experience of Madden 11. I know what you're thinking, without JVB on the show this week, who will carry the mantle for NFL 2K5? You'll have to listen to find out. Rounding out episode 113 is a talk about the role communites currently play and should play within the game development process. In this podcaster's opinion, there were lots of thought provoking statements made during this talk, hopefully you will agree.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>So we knew Godfree was coming on this week to talk about the Mafia 2 Launch Parties in Miami and New York. But we didn't plan on Parris from Remember When showing up to join the fun. What resulted was a podcast that could have easily lasted over 3 hours. Instead you get those two along with the main crew of SugarFree, JVB, SoldierX01, Phoenix410 and HeroicSuperman. We promise you wont be disappointed.</p>
<p>We have some strong impressions on the Medal of Honor Beta (note, strong does not mean positive). Heroic Superman's revisiting of the sleeper hit Darksiders leads to an interesting discussion about God of War 3. Godfree weighs in on the latest Summer of Arcade release for the Xbox Live Arcade, Castlevania HD. And of course, JVB has a new topic in his ever-evolving "Analyze This" segment. Good times.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's time for the Post Game Report to issue its closing statement on E3. JVB leads a serious discussion of everything the video game industry has to offer featuring Parris, Phoenix410, SugarFree, HeroicSuperman and special guest TG1_Eddie<br /><br />The first part of this episode is purely the Mind of Parris. Listen in for his thoughts about the press conferences from the "Big Three" - Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo - and detailed impressions of Kinect and Move. Naturally there are plenty of tangents and quick asides from all over Los Angeles. Due to some technical difficulties we couldn't get him to comment on Nintendo's 3DS, but rumor is, he is a believer.<br /><br />After the break the full crew takes over for their impressions including: SugarFree going to the balcony, JVB wanting more from PSN+, Phoenix still loving Gears of War, HeroicSuperman's high hopes for Kinect, and Eddie's obsession with trying to "catch 'em all". We will return with PGR Proper next week including SoldierX's full impressions of E3.<br /><br />As always, leave us feedback at our email address - pgr@talkingaboutgames.com, find us on twitter @PostGameReport or chime in on the forums.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>With E3 right around the corner, the Post Game Report has some  predictions for you. Some bold, some beautiful, some good, some bad,  some outright ugly. SugarFree hosts JVB, SoldierX, Phoenix410 and  HeroicSuperman for another week of banter, jokes and the occasional  comment on something video game related. Before the E3 talk we have some  thoughts on the iPhone 4 and whatever the heck Mortal Kombat: Rebirth  is.</p>
<p>As an appetizer for E3 2010, we each highlight a  disappointment from E3 2009.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[With E3 right around the corner, the Post Game Report has some  predictions for you. Some bold, some beautiful, some good, some bad,  some outright ugly. SugarFree hosts JVB, SoldierX, Phoenix410 and  HeroicSuperman for another week of banter, jokes and the occasional  comment on something video game related. Before the E3 talk we have some  thoughts on the iPhone 4 and whatever the heck Mortal Kombat: Rebirth  is.
As an appetizer for E3 2010, we each highlight a  disappointment from E3 2009. For the main course: predictions for  Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony with a few miscellaneous predictions  sprinkled on top. You might not want to listen to this podcast while you  are driving. One prediction in particular will cause traffic accidents.  And did I mention that the Godfather, Parris is back again this week?  Oh, well he is. You're welcome.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The other title nominee for Episode 99 was the Super Lightning Round,   however it lost the coin toss this week. Anyway...SugarFree, JVB,  SoldierX and Phoenix410 have gathered to discuss a multitude of news  topics for the week.

Phoenix  has some kind words for the 3D movement, especially if it involves The  Dark Knight. Soldier breaks out his crystal ball for the first round of  E3 2010 predictions. JVB has a man-crush on Kevin Butler. And SugarFree  loves the idea of watching baseball games on his PS3.</p>
<p>To be  honest with  you, that doesn't even come close to the range of topics we cover on  Episode 99 of the Post Game Report. You're better off just listening to  the fun that ensued.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Where has the time gone? All of a sudden Episode 100 is just a few weeks  away. Before we get to triple-digits, Episode 98 of the Post Game  Report is yours for the taking. SugarFree is joined by SoldierX,  Phoenix410, HeroicSuperman and our guest, Joe Haygood (<a id="z:-i" title="@mclazyj" href="http://twitter.com/mclazyj">@mclazyj</a>)  from <a id="f2h5" title="Aeropause.com" href="http://www.aeropause.com/">Aeropause.com</a>. We try something a little  different this week - fewer topics with deeper discussion. Let us know  what you think as we break down the Gears of War 3 trailer and what the  Spring launch date means for the game, Microsoft, and...Project Natal?  Also the guys Mark and Execute Splinter Cell: Conviction. Soldier has  finished the game, multiple times, and has his final thoughts ready for  you. HeroicSuperman and SugarFree also join the Sam Fisher Fan Club for a  spoiler free discussion about the highs and lows from Ubisoft's notable  diversion from the status quo. Finally there's an extended Community  Questions segment that features questions and answers as diverse as the  Talking About Games Community.

<p style="margin: 0px;">The Penny Arcade Expo in Boston is in full swing and we have the podcast to prove it. There are too many people participating in this podcast to list in this short summary, however we are not short personality. But believe me, there are plenty of laughs to be had as we dissect our first full day inside the Hynes Convention Center. Day 1 conversation topics include the official announcement of USB hard drive support for the Xbox 360, the games we've seen or played and we provide some commentary on the panels we saw during the day.</p>

<p>We are oh so very close to Boston. The anticipation is killing us. Join us for this, the last podcast before we dine on Clam Chowder for the weekend. The full crew of JVB, SugarFree, Phoenix410, SoldierX and HeroicSuperman welcome Talking About Gamers own Golf Rat and The Godfather, Parris for a lively discussion of the week that was. Games discussed include the Splinter Cell Conviction Demo, Perfect Dark HD, an update on Soldier's Dog Tags in Battlefield Bad Company 2 and of course, God of War 3. The discussion also touches on what, if any game, will be a system seller for Sony and why the rumored USB support for the Xbox 360 might not be a great idea.</p>]]></description>

JVB, SugarFree, SoldierX01, HeroicSuperman and frequent guest TG1_Eddie are joined by Paul from the Video Game Jocks to spread some joy into your ear buds. Among the discussion points this week are Modern Warfare 2 patches, Mirror's Edge on your iPhone, and gamers going gaga over Mega Man 10. Plus we spend a healthy amount of time talking about Dante's Inferno from the recently released Demo (which you should download) to the &quot;Divine Edition&quot; coming to the PlayStation 3 exclusively.</p>
<p>Also there is a special segment after the show devoted to the MTV sensation, Jersey Shore. It's an uncensored conversation, but this podcaster believes it is well worth your time.</p>

<p>Another episode of the Post Game Report is ready to go, did you miss us? This week SugarFree, JVB, SoldierX25 and HeroicSuperman have a lot to talk about. Lord Voldemort has shown his ugly side and gamers are not pleased with Infinity Ward's decision to remove dedicated servers from their highly anticipated sequel. Ratchet and Clank are back for another round of Dual-Shocky Goodness, find out which of the hosts will be picking this one up (and when). SugarFree gives his impressions on Uncharted 2, how much koolaid has he consumed? And of course, Borderlands is the one game everyone is talking about, we have a length discussion about the good, the great, and the potential longevity of this highly anticipated Role Playing Shooter. Oh, and something about JVB wearing a dress?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Post Game Report - Episode 76: The Nathan Station</p>
<p>I can't think of a better way to start your work week than Episode 76 of the Post Game Report. Join SugarFree, JVB, SoldierX25 and HeroicSuperman on another epic journey through the latest in the video game industry. This week we discuss our favorite tracks on Lego Rock Band, discuss the upcoming demo availability schedule for Left 4 Dead 2, profess our love for Borderlands and of course Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. This week's lightning round consists of more Splinter Cell talk, pondering what color Wii-mote will be released next and the highly anticipated Spec-Ops mode from a game we cannot talk about.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you cannot be told how awesome Episode 76 is, you have to experience it for yourself. Enjoy.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Post Game Report - Episode 75: The M.A.S.H Unit</p>
<p>Neither Swine Flu, Mallet Tours nor Launch Parties can hold back the Post Game Report. Episode 75 is coming at you with an impressive collective of voices to fill the void left by some unfortunate absences. SugarFree and JVB welcome VicJo from Talking About Gamers, TG1_Eddie from the TAG Community and our special guest, The Scarfinger. This week the new voices have plenty of opportunity to shine as we discuss the latest campaign trailer from a game we're not allowed to talk about, the latest announcements about Left 4 Dead 2, future DLC for Forza 3 and have a lively discussion about all things Uncharted 2.</p>
<p>&quot;Man Tips&quot;, tangents, and a couple special segments from some familiar voices await you this week. Enjoy.</p>

Fable 3 has been announced, will Parris be there Day 1? Shadow Complex is a critical success but only one member of the PGR crew is a fan of this game. Where does District 9 rank among Parris' all-time Science Fiction movies? All of these questions are answered and we still have plenty of time to take an objective look at the big moves made by Sony regarding the PS3 Slim as well as a broader look at the future of the industry. And what podcast with Parris would be complete without a tangent to Lost?]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[JVB is late, SoldierX is an entrepreneur, and SugarFree loves Cortana. Out of context that makes no sense, but after listening to Episode 67 of the Post Game Report, you will find enlightenment. This week we are joined by RobbieJo of TalkingAboutGamers fame. Join us for an in-depth discussion of all things Fallout 3 including impressions of Mothership Zeta. If you haven't been paying attention, Soldier loves him some Fallout 3. We discuss the potential of the Activision Boycott that has caught the eyes and ears of gamers around the world. JVB brings a whiteboard up to the balcony this week to break down the X's and O's of Madden '10. Also, SugarFree attempts to justify spending $20 on a single item during our discussion about the Xbox Avatar Marketplace.]]></description>

			<title>Post Game Report: Episode 66 The Prenuptial Agreement</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/joebeta/PGR66_9-Aug-2009_mp3.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Post Game Report - Episode 66: The Prenuptial Agreement</p>
<p>Cozy up with that special someone as Phoenix410, SoldierX25, SugarFree are joined by Mr and Mrs LeftyBrown, The Married Gamers on Episode 66 of the Post Game Report. Believe it or not, when we aren't waving mallets at each other we also play video games. To celebrate this novelty we share our impressions of TMNT: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled and attempt to justify why this game was a waste of money. Soldier reminds us why Batman: Arkham Asylum was his game of E3 and why each of you should be playing the newly released demo. We follow the breadcrumbs to the PS3 Slim that everyone believes is coming to discuss how this inevitability will impact Sony's bottom line. There is also a rather lively discussion about GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra.</p>
<p>No animals were harmed in the recording of this podcast. But we can't say the same for childhood memories of Storm Shadow and Snake Eyes.</p>
