			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It’s  that time: holiday cheer, the sound of sleigh bells, and buy buy buy  our way into happiness. Yes Thanksgiving is a day to remember the many  blessings that have been given to us; our life, family, our jobs, and  our eternal salvation hidden in Jesus. We have so much to be thankful  for, yet as thanksgiving presents itself, many homes are planning how  they can chime in on the holiday sales, beating others to the stores,  gaining the best bargains on that new TV, or gathering all the videos  they can at that all time low price, and the attitude that fills the  malls; well its an attitude that’s everything but an attitude of  thankfulness.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Honking horns and <span> </span>cursing  can be heard in the shopping mall parking lots, cutting in line,  shoving and pushing is found on the inside of the stores across the  nation, and the thankfulness found on that day; well I guess it only  lasts until the turkey has begun to digest. We find people uptight, and  stressed, neglecting to take a moment to remember what the Lord has done  in their lives. Listen scripture says in the book of Hebrews 13:5</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Keep  your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you  have, because God has said; “never will I leave you never will I forsake  you. So we can say with confidence, the Lord is my helper, I can not be  afraid what can man do to me?</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>I  encourage you; take your time remembering what the Lord has done for  you this year. The year may have presented its trials, you may have had  to endure some tribulations, but be encouraged by the fact that God, the  God who created you, loves you, and will never leave you abandoned. So  when you&#8217;re out doing your holiday shopping, remember the greates gift  that has been given to you, is not only priceless, but it&#8217;s free; so  give it away; the love of Jesus Christ.</span></span></p>

Twas the night before Christmas
Joseph and Mary on the Run
Knowing King Herod wanted the head of their son,
They came to the inn, there weren’t rooms anymore
Not a bed, not a cot, not room on the floor.
Mary went out to the fields with the cows and the horses
She gave birth to our savior all heaven rejoices.
Joseph arrived and said “what did I miss”
But when he saw baby Jesus he offered a kiss.
A star brightly shines for the world to see
Is God saying I now unite you unto me.
Believe in my son and you’ll never die,
Draw near unto me and to you I’ll draw nigh.
God said anything you ask in Jesus name you’ll receive,
Give love unto others and you’ve done t for me.
Though Santa is jolly and places gifts under your tree
My gifts will not perish if you live unto me.
So remember this Christmas to keep Jesus your sight.
Merry Christmas to all and to all a good LIFE</itunes:summary>

<p> Have you found difficulty finding time to pray? Have you found difficulty while trying to hear the voice of the Lord speak to you? Television, Compact Disks, Radio, and other media outlets have become a very loud noise in our homes these days. Trying to find a quiet place in our homes to read our Bibles and pray is rarity, but that doesn&#8217;t make spending some quiet time with God any less important. God desires that we would set some time aside to spend with him, but the truth is that we&#8217;ve made cell phone calls, social networking, programmed T.V. and Radio a priority while wondering why we just don&#8217;t hear the Lord speak to us. Truth is&#8230;if we want to hear from the Lord, then we need to make some changes.</p>
<p>Matthew 6:6 says: When you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut the door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place, and your father who sees in secret will reward you openly.</p>
<p>You see sometimes we just need to shut the door to the things that are going on around us. we need to shut off the TV, shut off the radio, silence the phone, and spend some time with God, I tell you the truth, not only will the Lord hear your prayer, He will speak to you, give you direction, and give you a hope that is greater than any sitcom, phone call, or radio program could ever give.</p>

It&#8217;s pretty funny, while at the same time the message really makes you think about the way that you live your life. Are we living to build up a Kingdom of our own on this earth? Or are we striving and pursuing an eternal kingdom with the Lord?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all had to pose for a picture at one time or another; a wedding photo, a school photo, a mugshot-well hopefully not a mugshot but I think you get the idea. We strike our best pose, and let out our best smile, showing our best side, hoping that the camera will magnify our best facial qualities, while hiding the pimple we woke up with or that cracked tooth that whistles every time we speak. We take these pictures so that we can remember the event or the date. And there&#8217;s no doubt that we want to look our best so we can remember how good we appeared as well. But let me ask you, in the midst of always trying to look good, smile beautifully, and hide our facial insecurities, have we neglected the most important part of our appearance? Have we forgotten that Jesus wants to take on the main appearance in our life?</p>
<p>Colossians 3:1 If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God. Set your minds on the things above, not on the things of the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory.</p>
<p>Listen Jesus wants to appear in you and I. He wants to be the one who shines through us. Jesus wants His love to shine brighter than our teeth and our highlights. Jesus wants to be bigger than our hair and our muscles. Jesus wants to appear in us whether we&#8217;re asleep or awake, rich or poor, sick or healthy, and the good news is that His appearance will never fade. I encourage you, next time your looking in the mirror preparing for your families photo time, remember the one who wants to take center stage in your life, and ask yourself, &#8220;Is Jesus appearing in me today?&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever had a friend who complained about everything? The quality of the air, the little things that people do, and even the smell of watermelon? I&#8217;ve often noticed people in the community complaining about everything and anything, in fact, complaining seems to be a major topic for most peoples discussion doesn&#8217;t it? So here comes the question-why? Why do we spend so much of the time that we have with one another complaining, when we could be using it to lift one another up?</p>
<p>Scripture tells us in Philippians 2:14 to do everything without complaining. And what should we say that the word everything means? Yep everything means everything. You see God wants us to focus on the goodness that He has bestowed on us, the blessings that God has given to us. God wants us to live this life with a thankful heart. But if we keep complaining about every little thing that comes our way, then we had better get used to the misery of life. We shouldn&#8217;t expect the Lord to give anything to us if we remain in a constant stink about everything. I encourage you to focus on the good things in life. Even though Aunt Edna may always talk with her mouth full, be thankful your family has food to eat. Every time you have to sit in traffic, be thankful you have a car to sit in traffic with. You see, learn to look at the brighter, better, and good side of life. You&#8217;ll be a happier person because of it, and God will continue to pour out his blessings to you if you would just learn to stop complaining. And even though you may always go around saying &#8220;I hate that, I hate that&#8221; the truth is God is in heaven looking at your attitude saying the very same thing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much time do you spend on Twitter, MySpace, and Facebook? Did you know that the average person spends 5 minutes of every hour on a social network? 5 Minutes! That&#8217;s 2 Hours a day on a social network, meanwhile we have most of our population that claims that they just don&#8217;t have enough time to pray, and read the Word of God. Does this make any sense to you, cause it sure has me confused. We spend time writing little notes on Twitter to all of our followers whom we call Twits, yet we receive little to no strength, hope, or consolation from them. So why do we spend this time on a social network and neglect the lord? That my friend is a question that we all need to ask ourselves.</p>
<p>Listen, I encourage you to put down the computer and the smart phone for just a few minutes out of that time that you&#8217;re spending on a social network, and use this time to spend with the Lord. You&#8217;ll see that with the Lord you will find hope, peace, and a better life if you would take some of that time to speak with strangers, to have fellowship with God, and the best part of it is that God won&#8217;t call you one of His Twits, you&#8217;ll be a living, breathing, and communicating Child Of God.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our day to day lives it&#8217;s easy to joke and even pass off some intense circumstances with a joke, or funny comment. But I&#8217;ve noticed that this joking can also play into our spiritual lives as well, and my friend if you, or someone you know doesn&#8217;t know Jesus, there&#8217;s nothing funny about it.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s personalize this; have you ever tried to tell someone about Jesus and had them turn your faith into into a joke? Maybe you dont know the Lord, and you&#8217;ve been making Jesus Christ out to be some kind of joke in your life saying things like &#8220;I&#8217;ll live while I&#8217;m alive, and sleep when I&#8217;m dead&#8221;. Though it may sound appealing to do as you please while you&#8217;re alive, and then live for the Lord when you die, it just doesn&#8217;t work out that way my friend.</p>
<p>Listen the truth is that Jesus loves you, and there&#8217;s nothing that you can do to change that, but frankly speaking, if we choose to leave the door of our hearts closed while Jesus stands at the door knocking, then we shouldn&#8217;t expect the Lord to open the door to heaven when one day we come knocking either.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Revelation 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.</span></p>
<p>You see the Lord wants to enter into your life, to have fellowship with you, to love you, and to shape you into a man or woman after God&#8217;s own heart, and though you may claim that Jesus is the Lord of your life, the truth is in your heart. Ask yourself; is He is truly living in your heart, ask yourself if you&#8217;ve truly opened the door to your heart and are having fellowship with Him. If you&#8217;ve answered &#8220;No&#8221; then it&#8217;s time open the door and truly let Him live in you. Jesus doesn&#8217;t see this gift as joke and the truth is neither should we. So though our day to day conversation may be filled with jokes, let your relationship with God be confidently proclaimed as not just some passive relationship, but proclaim the truth, Jesus is your source of life.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever tried to reach God in a more intimate way but didn&#8217;t know how? Have you perused the aisles of your local book store, looking for a new and in depth method of prayer and worship in an effort to get Gods attention? Maybe you&#8217;ve even gone to the extents of learning to Yodel to God. Too often we think that God is looking to be impressed by our great extravagantefforts to reach Him in a new way with new methods, when in reality God just wants us to spend time with Him, yes, the key to the Lords heart is wrapped up in one very short verse.</p>
<p>! Thessalonians 5:17 says to &#8220;Pray Continually&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right! Two words, one short verse tells us that all we need to do to reach God; Pray Continually. We can pray while working or at School. We can pray while we&#8217;re eating, or driving to the store. You see praying continually means just that. So listen if you&#8217;ve purchased your DVD  lesson on &#8220;How to Yodel to God&#8221;. Put it down; that is of course unless you&#8217;re really looking to yodel. I encourage you to open your Bible, bow your head in Prayer, and reach the Lord in your prayers, and when you say amen-Begin your prayers again, because God is never tired of talking with you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: small;">I always wondered what an airline flight would be like without the food carts. What if the Plane took off, and left the food cart on the airport tarmac? Would it be chaos? Would there be screaming? Who knows, every flight that I&#8217;ve been on has always been nicely stocked with sodas, coffee, and enough peanuts to feed an elephant. But the question still remains, what if? Have you ever found yourself easily stressed, anxious, worried, and well let’s face it, even overreacting when the trials and hardships of life arise? It&#8217;s easy to worry about what we&#8217;ll eat, wear, of even drive when we look in our wallet and see nothing. But let’s not forget that God has you and I as His top priority, God promises to provide all of our needs, but we have a responsibility to keep our eyes on Him rather than on the hard pressing circumstances of life.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: small;">Matthew 6:31-34 Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ </span><a></a><span style="font-size: small;">For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. </span><a></a><span style="font-size: small;">But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. </span><a></a><span style="font-size: small;">Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day <em>is</em> its own trouble.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt; line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="color: black; font-family: &amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;serif&amp;quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="font-size: small;">So I encourage you to stop worrying about your life; what you’re going to eat, wear, or even about your future. God holds your life in His hands, so rather than seeking what you&#8217;ll eat, seek the Lord and do everything that you can do to be pleasing to him. And next time you begin to worry about your life, just remember that not only are you God&#8217;s top priority, but He hasn&#8217;t left your needs on the airport tarmac.</span></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve all heard of the many times that men and women have been left standing at the wedding altar and walking away without their hopeful marriage. I have even heard of people getting cold feet as they were reciting their vows, and suddenly backing out of the wedding altogether. This leaves their fience&#8217; with crushed hopes and dreams, and a life that was supposed to be a &#8220;Happily ever after&#8221; style life is suddenly crushed. So let me ask, has this ever happened to you? Now, maybe it hasn&#8217; lt happened to you in marriage, but what about in your relationship with God? Yes I&#8217;ve noticed that it&#8217;s easy to step to the altar and accept God&#8217;s Vow to love us, forgive us, and give us a hope and a future. But what happens when it&#8217;s your turn to fulfill your vows? To serve Him, Love Him, and follow Him regardless of the circumstances of life. Yes, many times we are more willing to take God&#8217;s hand and His benefits of our relationship but let me ask&#8230;if we don&#8217;t Give anything in return, Do we really expect Him to stick around? Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230;I&#8217;m not saying that God will leave us, I&#8217;m just trying to provoke your thoughts about the condition of your relationship with God. Many people gladly accept the benefits from the father, but accepting the responsibilities of being a Child Of God, that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p>The book of Nahum tells us to preform our Vows and the Wicked one will no more pass through us. And Jesus tells us in the book of Matthew 22:37 to Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. Jesus says that this is the first and the greatest commandment. </p>
<p>So I encourage you; step up to the altar and Give your life to the Lord. Live for the Lord and Love the Lord with all of your heart so that you can stand up and be proudly proclaimed a true and dedicated Child of God.</p>

		<itunes:summary>We've all heard of the many times that men and women have been left standing at the wedding altar and walking away without their hopeful marriage. I have even heard of people getting cold feet as they were reciting their vows, and suddenly backing out of the wedding altogether. This leaves their fience' with crushed hopes and dreams, and a life that was supposed to be a "Happily ever after" style life is suddenly crushed. So let me ask, has this ever happened to you? Now, maybe it hasn' lt happened to you in marriage, but what about in your relationship with God? Yes I've noticed that it's easy to step to the altar and accept God's Vow to love us, forgive us, and give us a hope and a future. But what happens when it's your turn to fulfill your vows? To serve Him, Love Him, and follow Him regardless of the circumstances of life. Yes, many times we are more willing to take God's hand and His benefits of our relationship but let me ask...if we don't Give anything in return, Do we really expect Him to stick around? Don't get me wrong...I'm not saying that God will leave us, I'm just trying to provoke your thoughts about the condition of your relationship with God. Many people gladly accept the benefits from the father, but accepting the responsibilities of being a Child Of God, that's another story.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever listened to those talk radio programs? You know the ones; these shows that take telephone calls from people who are desperately wanting to have their voices heard when all the while, there problems are left unsolved. There are many of these programs that are riding and thriving on the airwaves. Yes we live in a time where people are begging to complain and wine on the air in front of thousands of people, and why? Because they want to be heard and they want others to identify with them.  Unfortunately these programs are doing nothing more than exploiting our problems, and using our sorrows to make them money. They don&#8217;t solve our problems, they don&#8217;t calm our fears, and the truth is that when we hang up the telephone, our complaints are still there waiting for us. So the only answer is to call out to someone who can help, someone who will listen, and someone who cares.</p>
<p>Isiah 55:6 says- seek the Lord while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.</p>
<p>Psalm 5:2 says- listen to my cry for help my King, for to you I pray. In the morning Lord you hear my voice. I lay my request before you and I wait in expectation.</p>
<p>So listen, next time you need to talk to someone who truly cares, put down the phone, shut off the radio, and call on the Lord. Lay your request before Him, and the Lord will not only listen, but He will give you what you need to live this life in peace.</p>

Up and down, loop de loops, and finally you think to yourself &#8220;I should have just went on the Carousel&#8221;. Yes the Rollercoaster can be a scary and sickening adventure but there is one thing that is always reassuring, and that&#8217;s the fact that there is an operator of the ride who knows the track like the back of his hand; he knows when the ride goes up and down. The operator of the ride knows when it could get scary, and when it is nice and easy. The operator knows when it’s going to be a rough ride, or a smooth ride. He even knows that the Roller Coaster may very well make us sick; but the most comforting thing to everybody on that Roller Coaster is in knowing that the operator is there to make sure that we stay on track, and make it off the ride safely.</span></p>
<p style="line-height: 14.25pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #000000;">You know life can be a lot like a Roller Coaster; we have our ups and down, and sometimes we even have our loops. There are times when life is smooth, when other times life can be very rough. But the good news is that we too have an operator for this ride of life; that&#8217;s right, God is in control of our life. He knows when the ride may get scary, rough, and even sickening. But one thing is for sure; God is in control. </span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever met someone who appeared to be a Godly person. Somebody who stood upright, and stood out from amongst the world. Sure you&#8217;ve see them as they&#8217;ve carried their Bible into Church, spoke with a tamed toungue, and appeared to carry the virtue of love; the kind of person you&#8217;ve desired to be. However when their away from the Church there&#8217;s a different person that surfaces; a dirty talking, foul living individual who goes to church, but the fruit of a changed life is nowhere to be found on this tree. The question is-who are you fooling? Potty talk makes us look foolish, dirty joking reveals a heart rooted in perversion. And how is God glorified, and Christ represented amongst all of this?</p>
<p>Matthew 5:13 tells us that we are to be the light of Jesus to the world, a city on a hill. We&#8217;re even told to be like salt; a flavor that is easily recognized  amongst men. Yes we&#8217;re to live a life that represents our changed life. A life that represents the Love, and dedication that we have for the Lord.</p>
<p>So listen, if you&#8217;ve found your light to be growing dim, or your salt to be losing its flavor, then let me encourage you. Put away all filth and lust. Clean up your language, so you can be a clear representation of Christ to the world. And represent what God can do in a life just like yours.</p>

Matthew 5:13 tells us that we are to be the light of Jesus to the world, a city on a hill. We're even told to be like salt; a flavor that is easily recognized  amongst men. Yes we're to live a life that represents our changed life. A life that represents the Love, and dedication that we have for the Lord.

So listen, if you've found your light to be growing dim, or your salt to be losing its flavor, then let me encourage you. Put away all filth and lust. Clean up your language, so you can be a clear representation of Christ to the world. And represent what God can do in a life just like yours.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Have you ever found yourself to be in a Restaurant, ready to say grace while that specific prayer time gets continuously interrupted? Or maybe you’ve been at home in prayer, only to find yourself watching the clock or easily distracted by the telephone? I know; you’ve gone into your prayer closet to pray but found yourself cleaning the closet instead. Listen life can be quite busy in and of itself, but if we’re finding that our communication, and conversation with God is suffering, and even taking a back seat to the importance of your communication with the waiter at the restaurant, then it’s apparent, you’ve got a problem with your prayer life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Hebrews 4:16 says to come boldly to the throne of grace in prayer</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Psalms 37:4 tells us that our prayer is a delight to the Lord and He desires to hear our prayers</p>
<div></div>
<p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Calibri;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">So listen, next time you find yourself with divided attention in your prayers; remember that the Lord yearns for this time with you, so delight yourself in Him, with some one on one conversation.</p>
