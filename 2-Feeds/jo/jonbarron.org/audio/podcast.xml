 <title>Obesity Study: Larger Meal Portions Infers Status -- Health Podcast</title>
 <link>http://www.jonbarron.org/weight-loss/podcast-meal-portion-size-status</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Obesity statistics in the US convey a sad story:&amp;nbsp; more than two-thirds of all adults over the age of 20 now qualify as overweight or obese.&amp;nbsp; Yet, in spite of the endless array of available diet programs, products, and the constant media coverage highlighting the dangers of being overweight, we keep getting fatter and fatter, with obesity rates still on the climb. While many blame a willpower deficit for the failure of 95 percent of all diet attempts, a series of new studies has shed some light on a few other possible reasons that all the diet knowledge in the universe doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be making a dent.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have taken an IQ test at some point in your life, whether at school or through an evaluation, the number you achieved way back when may not be the same number you would score today.&amp;nbsp; That&amp;#39;s because IQs can change over the years, according to new research.&amp;nbsp; So instead of an IQ score being a benchmark of fixed intelligence that can be used as a predictor of success, it is really just a measurement of one &amp;quot;type&amp;quot; of intelligence at a randomly chosen point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent obesity study out of Australia has concluded that when people lose weight, their metabolism automatically slows down and they experience hormonal changes that increase appetite. The researchers theorized that these changes, not portion size, the types of food eaten, or lack of exercise, etc., explain why most dieters so quickly gain back what they lost.&amp;nbsp; Or to put it in simpler terms; being overweight is not your fault. It&amp;#39;s biology.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Junk Food Diets &amp; Male Infertility -- Men&#039;s Health Podcast</title>
 <link>http://www.jonbarron.org/natural-health/podcast-junk-food-male-infertility</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A recent study out of the Harvard School of Public Health, found that when men eat fatty, unhealthy food, their sperm lose the ability to move vigorously enough to make the journey all the way up the ovarian tube. A related study found that eating trans fats reduces sperm count. Added together, these facts seem to indicate that a junk food diet may lead men to male infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New Taxes Placed On Junk Food? -- Health Podcast</title>
 <link>http://www.jonbarron.org/natural-health/podcast-taxing-junk-food</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;By applying a tax to items like sugary drinks, greasy French fries, and foods such as cookies and doughnuts that have no nutritional value at all, the government would be making those foods more expensive and hopefully less appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Is Annual Mammography For Breast Cancer Screening Effective? -- Health Podcast</title>
 <link>http://www.jonbarron.org/alternative-cancer/podcast-annual-breast-cancer-screening</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;It is the expected norm within the medical community that women -- especially those over 40 or with a family history of breast cancer -- should get their annual mammography without fail.&amp;nbsp; But how effective of a tool is it in actually saving lives? According to a recent study by an international team of researchers at various European institutions, the answer is that it&amp;#39;s not especially effective.&amp;nbsp; Breast cancer screening was not shown to have a major impact on the reduction of breast cancer mortality in the recent past.&amp;nbsp; While the mortality rates from breast cancer have certainly gone down in most developed countries in the last two decades, it would seem that the lower numbers might not be attributable to mammography.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Could Exercise Prevent Alzheimer&#039;s?  Listen To Jon Barron&#039;s Health Podcast</title>
 <link>http://www.jonbarron.org/anti-aging/podcast-exercise-reduce-alzheimers-prevention</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;A new study recently released by the University of California in San Francisco, suggests that the single biggest risk factor leading to Alzheimer&amp;#39;s in the US is lack of exercise. Twenty-one percent of all instances of the disease, or 1.1 million cases, could be prevented if more people exercised regularly, according to the researchers.&amp;nbsp; Depression causes another 15 percent, says the study, smoking 11 percent, hypertension eight percent, obesity in midlife and low education each trigger seven percent, and diabetes correlates to three percent.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;p&gt;Why is it that In the world of &amp;quot;scientific&amp;quot; medicine, deeply ingrained beliefs (e.g. flu shots, statin drugs, antidepressants, hormone replacement therapy, fluoridated water, and amalgam fillings) are seemingly beyond challenge&amp;nbsp;-- no matter how much evidence you present to the contrary?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Avoid DEHA In Plastic Containers &amp; Bags -- Health Podcast</title>
 <link>http://www.jonbarron.org/detox/DEHA-dangers-plastic-containers-podcast</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Most plastic wrap contains a substance called DEHA, which has properties similar to phthalates&amp;mdash;those nasty components in BPA plastics. Like phthlates, DEHA acts as an endocrine disruptor in the body. Studies have linked it directly to liver tumors in mice, as well as to asthma in children and to a wide range of cancers. Listen to Jon Barron&amp;#39;s health podcast to learn how to avoid these toxins that are so commonly in our plastic containers and take back control of your health!&lt;/p&gt;
