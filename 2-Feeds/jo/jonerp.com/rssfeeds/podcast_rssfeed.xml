            <title>Video Blog: SAP Virtualization - Does it Matter?</title>
            <description>I was fortunate to have three opinionated SAP virtualization die hards, Chris Kernaghan, Martin English, and Tom Cenens subject themselves to my first official Hangout taping (note that Tomâ€™s correct Twitter handle is @tomcenens).
During the 40 minute video, we dug into some potent SAP virtualization topics.</description>

            <title>SAP and Social Media - BS or Value? Live from Madrid</title>
            <description>With all the JD-OD.com videos posted, it&apos;s time to catch up with the best of the audio, including this session from SAP TechED Madrid, on &quot;SAP Social Media: BS or Value.&quot; Taped live at my expert lounge session, this was a typical JonERP &quot;unpresentation&quot; with no slides, just an uncensored and hopefully valuable conversation. We talked for 25 minutes, digging into whether there is value in social media for SAP professionals and how you go about finding it.</description>

            <title>Technical SAP Skills in the Age of Outsourcing - Live from Madrid</title>
            <description>My first EMEA TechEd was a dandy. With all the JD-OD.com videos posted, it&apos;s time to catch up with the best of the audio, including this session on SAP technical skills from Madrid. Taped live at my expert lounge session on &quot;SAP Tech Skills in the Age of Outsourcing,&quot; we had a great 25 minute discussion about SAP technical skills at the crossroads. The audience was about equally divided between Basis folks and ABAPpers, so we balanced the talk between SAP administration and development skills.</description>

            <title>Debating the Value of SAP HANA</title>
            <description>Straight talk about HANA is hard to come by - but not with the group I pulled together for this international call. I have rarely looked forward to a call as much as this one, because I didn&apos;t know where the discussion would lead. I suspected we would have some significant points of debate and disagreement - I was not disappointed.

During this 60 minute podcast, you&apos;ll hear SAP Mentors and bloggers Vijay Vijayasankar, John Appleby, and Vitality Rudnytskiy talk HANA as only they can</description>

            <title>Live SAP Tech Skills Chat from Las Vegas</title>
            <description>Here&apos;s an annual tradition: my SAP TechEd skills chat, taped live from the Expert Lounge. Although there was some crowd noise, this recording came out pretty well and captured a range of views during a short 17 minute recording time. Since a major theme of the future of SAP technical skills is the convergence of functional and technical skills, I was fortunate to have SAP Business Process expert Jim Link amongst the participants in the taped discussion.</description>

            <title>Talking SAP Business ByDesign Partner Issues - with Tetlow and De Araujo</title>
            <description>SAP Business ByDesign (and on-demand in general) was not a focal point of the keynotes from TechEd Las Vegas and Bangalore. To get a better sense of where Business ByDesign stands from a field view, I taped this 30 minute podcast with two ByDesign partners, SAP Mentor Leonardo De Araujo of Beyond Technologies and Ray Tetlow of Skyytek Corporation. Leo and Ray provided an honest view of the strengths of ByDesign and where improvements are needed to reach its potential.</description>

            <description>During this 50 minute podcast, you&apos;ll hear SAP Mentors Vijay Vijayasankar and Harald Reiter give you their tips for getting the best HANA content in TechEd Las Vegas. The informal discussion then moves into the key news stories that might unfold at TechEd surrounding HANA, with the usual opinionated takes and views from the field. The last half of the podcast is an in-depth discussion of HANA skills issues based on what Harald and Vijay are learning from their work on HANA Proof of Concept (POC) projects.</description>

            <description>Based out of Bangalore, Vijayan Venkataraman of ERP Logic is an expert in the ByDesign SDK who has more experience in the product than most people in the world. During our twenty minute talk, I ask Vijayan about the use cases for the ByD SDK, how difficult it is to train, the skills needed, and what features he&apos;s looking to see in future releases.</description>

            <title>SAP Mobility Video Podcast - Summer Roundup + TechEd Questions</title>
            <description>With HANA stealing most of the Sapphire Now headlines, important mobilty questions lingered after the event. To get to the bottom of those, I taped a three way video podcast with fellow SAP Mentors John Appleby and Kevin Benedict. During this 40 minute video spiced with a bit of sassiness, we hashed out the burning SAP mobility questions and also discussed what SAP needs to pull off in TechEd season for it to be deemed a success from a mobility perspective.</description>

            <title>The State of SAP HANA - Four SAP Mentors Share Their Views</title>
            <description>The story of SAP HANA is unfolding so rapidly that it&apos;s hard to keep up - even if you are following the developments closely. Too often, there seems to be a gap between the HANA buzz and the reality on the ground. Before the SAP TechEd season kicks into high gear, now is the perfect time to take the HANA pulse. Fresh off of several sessions with the SAP HANA team, including blogger and Mentor meetings, Jon Reed pulled together three SAP Mentors for an international call to get their views on HANA as it stands today.</description>

            <title>Ask HANA Questions, Get Answers - Three SAP Mentors Talk to the SAP HANA Team</title>
            <description>At Sapphire Now 2011, the central importance of HANA to SAP&apos;s vision was made abundantly clear. But as a result, that made the questions raised by HANA&apos;s ascendancy that much more important to answer. The SAP Blogger Relations team proposed the idea of doing a HANA podcast with me as the moderator and referree and I agreed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;During this 40 minute podcast, you&apos;ll hear SAP Mentors John Appleby and Ethan Jewett pressing SAP on some of the key HANA questions they have been hearing from SAP customers. I jump in once or twice with thoughts of my own - otherwise, after my intro, this is a free-flowing discussion with SAP&apos;s Jake Klein and Thomas Zurek providing in-depth answers and a good deal of useful context to the HANA discussion</description>

            <title>SAP BI Roundtable - Thorny Questions Edition with James Taylor of Decision Management Solutions</title>
            <description>For this pre-Sapphire return of our semi-regular SAP BI podcast series, fellow SAP Mentor and co-host Vijay Vijayasankar and I talked with special guest James Taylor of Decision Management Solutions about some of the tougher BI questions SAP - or any other vendor for that matter - must tackle. During the 50 minute podcast, we move from a look at 4.0 to a discussion of the importance of business rules and the issues SAP needs to address with separate rules engines for operations and analytics (including two for operations, BRF Plus and NetWeaver BRM). We talk about why predictive analytics matter to companies, and why vendors struggle to deliver meaningful predictive analytics solutions. A lively discussion of the importance of unstructured data catches the three of us jousting a bit on the relative importance of text analytics versus other BI priorities. We veer into a HANA discussion before wisely saving most of that one for a different podcast down the road.</description>

            <description>To get a better handle on the issues with breaking into SAP in today&apos;s market, I had the chance to tape a unique podcast with Tom Michael of Michael Management. The podcast includes two &quot;students&quot; from Michael Management&apos;s Pay it Forward SAP Training Program (PDF), which sponsored SAP training for five job seekers to help them move into SAP during a challenging SAP job market. We begin the podcast with Tom posing some questions to me about breaking into SAP in today&apos;s market. Then we enter into a free flowing discussion, with Tom and I taking any and all questions from the two aspiring SAP professionals who joined us on the call and shared their stories with us.</description>

            <description>Since I had SAP Mentor Leonardo De Araujo of Beyond Technologies on the line, I figured we should go ahead and tape a spontaneous podcast on some topics of interest. The end result is a very informal chat that covers a series of topics, most of them SAP SME related. During the 20 minute podcast, Leo and I discuss his pending attendance as a Mentor at SAP DKOM, what he&apos;s learning about Business ByDesign as a potential future Canadian partner, and his take on the SME market and SAP All-in-One.</description>

            <title>The Road Ahead for SAP Consultants - The SAP Mentor View</title>
            <description>For several years, SAP professionals have looked forward to SAP Mentor Vijay Vijayasankar&apos;s annual blog post, &quot;The Road Ahead for SAP Consultants.&quot; In honor of this always-provocative blog post, Jon pulled together fellow SAP Mentors Vijayasankar and Leonardo De Araujo for an in-depth discussion/debate about Vijay&apos;s skills rankings for 2011 and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The result? An hour long talk that goes into detail on emerging skills in BusinessObjects, HANA and Business ByDesign, as well as how core skills like ABAP development are evolving.</description>

            <title>The Launch of ASUGNews.com: A Podcast with Thomas Wailgum and Courtney Bjorlin</title>
            <description>Few events in the SAP space take me by total surprise. The launch of ASUGNews.com, with Thomas Wailgum and Courtney Bjorlin at the helm, was one of those rare exceptions, forcing me to set aside those &quot;industry assumptions&quot; and take a fresh look at a new player in the ecosystem. To get at the editorial motivations behind ASUGNews.com, I got on the phone with Tom and Courtney for this 24 minute podcast. My goals? To ask them a few questions that had been bugging me, to get a better handle on what they have in mind for the site, and to get their takes on SAP in 2011</description>

            <description>What is SAP&apos;s hottest, sexiest new technology? No, it&apos;s not HANA, it&apos;s not ByDesign. In this humorous-turned-serious podcast, Jon Reed and special guest and SAP Mentor Thorsten Franz talk about a hype-worthy technology known to insiders as &quot;SAP Business Workflow.&quot; After 11 minutes of satirical riffing, Jon and Thorsten turn their attention to more serious matters as Thorsten talks about the overlooked power of SAP Business Workflow and what the Workflow Influence Team is doing to impact SAP Workflow&apos;s production direction</description>

            <title>SAP Influencer Summit and 2011 Direction - SAP Mentor Roundtable</title>
            <description>What did we learn from the SAP Influencer Summit that we can apply to SAP in 2011? Why is the meaning of &quot;Influencer&quot; changing and what was the controversy around that definition? How are Mentors impacting the definition of Influencer and the blurring of lines between bloggers, analysts, and SAP experts? What did we make of SAP&apos;s on-demand, mobility, and StreamWork strategies? To get at these questions and more, I pulled together fellow SAP Mentors John Appleby of Bluefin Solutions and Dick Hirsch of Siemens IT Solutions and Services.</description>

            <title>SAP Mobility Buzz Decoder Ring - With John Appleby and Natascha Thomson</title>
            <description>It all started with a blog post. After TechEd 2010, SAP Mentor John Appleby of Bluefin Solutions posted a blog on his take on SAP mobility. Natascha Thomson of SAP read the blog and some of it didn&apos;t make sense to her. It was a clear case of buzzword alert! Seeking clear answers, Natascha and John asked me to referee a discussion between them on &quot;FAQs on SAP Enterprise Mobility.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During this thirty minute podcast, Natascha grills John on SAP Enterprise Mobility. Buzzwords are defined as we dig into everything from the impact of consumer technology to Project Gateway to the implications of HTML 5. Those listeners who make it towards the end of the podcast will be treated to some comic relief as once again a cellular caller (John) drops off a podcast on Enterprise Mobility, proving once and for all that &quot;Always Connected&quot; is a modern myth.</description>

            <title>SAP Enterprise Mobility - Where Do We Go From Here? (Benedict and Appleby)</title>
            <description>Why did SAP mobility experts leave SAP TechEd (Vegas and Berlin) with more questions than answers? How has the enterprise mobility space evolved since Sapphire 2010? And what does SAP need to accomplish in mobility to win the confidence of customers and partners? To get at these questions and more, I was approached by fellow SAP Mentors John Appleby of Bluefin Solutions and Kevin Benedict of Netcentric Strategies, who asked me to DJ an open discussion on SAP moblity. The result was a forty minute podcast, which I felt was of the caliber and depth I look for in ERP Lounge podcasts, so I&apos;ve added this to the series.</description>

            <description>What went down with SAP BusinessObjects and BI at TechEd? What questions were answered from our last podcast? What is coming with BusinessObjects 4.0 - will it live up to the hype? What the heck is the new Semantic Layer anyway? And how did Vijay end up with 200 people at a BusinessObjects session? What feedback has SAP taken into account, and what burning questions still remain?</description>

            <title>SAP BI Burning Questions - SAP TechEd 2010 Preflight Discussion</title>
            <description>What are the burning questions about SAP BI as we head into SAP Teched season? Will the keynotes answer questions about in-memory and accelerated data access? And how do you get the most out of the show and justify your attendance when budgets are tight? As we continue our &quot;sporadic SAP BI podcast series,&quot; which is part of the ERP Lounge podcast editions, I dig into these questions with two fellow SAP Mentors: Vijay Vijayasankar of IBM and newly-named SAP Mentor Greg Myers, who is a Senior Business Intelligence Engineer at SEI Investments in Oaks, Pennsylvania, and who is also the Chair of the ASUG BusinessObjects Security &amp; Administration SIG.</description>

            <title>Implementing SAP Business ByDesign - Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt&apos;s Story</title>
            <description>There are many unanswered questions about SAP Business ByDesign. Some of them can be answered by documenting the experience of the 100 or so pilot customers who have been through a ByD install and come out the other side. In my second podcast with an SAP Business ByDesign pilot customer, I talk with Judson Wickham of Pinkberry Frozen Yogurt&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;about their ByDesign implementation process. During this 22 minute podcast, Judson explains why Pinkberry chose ByDesign and what issues they overcame along the way. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Judson is an ideal interviewee for my JonERP podcast series because of his background in on-premise ERP, in his case, PeopleSoft. During the podcast, Judson speaks to the skills transitions he needed to make and what SAP professionals interested in ByDesign work are up against in terms of skills evolution. Judson also shares his views on how SAP can improve ByDesign from here, and why the upcoming Software Development Kit (SDK) interests him from a customer&apos;s perspective.</description>

            <title>SAP BI Consulting - Strategies, Tools, and Skills Trends</title>
            <description>What it the future of SAP BI consulting? Why is there still lingering confusion over the SAP BusinessObjects tools amongst SAP users? And why is BI strategy an afterthought when it should really be incorporated into the core ERP implementation? To get a fresh take on these questions, I taped a podcast with Vijay Vijayasankar of IBM and Kevin McManus of McManus Consulting. Both these guys have deep SAP BI experience, and Kevin brings hands-on expertise in BusinessObjects tools into the conversation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the 55 minute podcast, we take a close look at which SAP BI skills are in demand. I ask the guys what separates a mediocre SAP BI consultant from an outstanding one. We talk about whether there are functional BI roles emerging, and why BI is becoming a skill that all SAP professionals need to reckon with. Is BI the &quot;holy grail&quot; of value realization for ERP projects? And is in-memory for real? Vijay and Kevin have answers to all these questions.</description>

            <title>Changing the Future of SAP Consulting - Roundtable</title>
            <description>The SAP consulting market is primed for change. Staffing layers with questionable value place obstacles between enterprise buyers and the best SAP consultants. While &quot;big box&quot; consulting models still have their place, SAP customers want to see alternatives that allow them to source subject matter experts directly, even sourcing them &quot;on demand&quot; for short term engagements. Internet technology and SaaS-influenced approaches create a fertile ground for SAP staffing innovation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To better understand the problems with the current SAP consulting model and the changes that are afoot, in this edition of The ERP Lounge, I invited three pioneers of new models to join me in a frank discussion. The result of our international teleconference was a 70 minute podcast that takes a hard look at the problems and offers up solutions that forge new ground for both consultants and SAP customers.</description>

            <title>The On-the-Job Realities of the SAP Business Process Expert - with Jim Link</title>
            <description>During this 20 minute podcast, Jim Link of Forest City gives me the project-tested scoop on many key BPX topics, including: how does a BPXer justify their value to the business, who do they report to, what role do process modeling tools play, and what SAP technical and functional skills do they need to succeed in the SAP Business Process Expert role.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Obviously, there are no universal answers to these questions - they are still being sorted out on a company to company basis. But for those listeners who want to understand how the pure BPX role can fit into the existing SAP personnel structure, and interact with Enterprise Architects, I trust you&apos;ll find this conversation as interesting as I did.</description>

            <title>Can You Have a Sustainable SAP Career in...Sustainability?</title>
            <description>Recently I taped a two-way discussion on careers in SAP sustainability with fellow SAP Mentor Jim Spath. Although Jim does not work in sustainability on a day to day basis, he&apos;s one of the most influential community voices in this area and has a 20 year background as an environmental engineer in his pre-SAP life. When we taped this thirty minute discussion, Jim and I were fresh off an SAP Mentor session on SAP&apos;s sustainabilty strategy with Jeremiah Stone of SAP. We wanted to react to that session - though some of it was &quot;not bloggable&quot; and we kept that content out. There were other SAP sustainability events to react to also, but mostly, we wanted to riff on SAP careers in sustainability and talk about the skills and the impact we can have by greening our SAP careers.</description>

            <description>With the release of his book - one of the most important business books in recent years (see my review on Amazon) - and with the reverberations of SAPPHIRENOW/ASUG Orlando still lingering, the timing was right to have Vinnie Mirchandani in The ERP Lounge to talk about his blogs on enterprise software and innovation. I wanted to dig into his opinionated takes on SAP and his critique of what he has dubbed the SAP &quot;egosystem.&quot; I was especially looking forward to asking Vinnie about how the &quot;polymath&quot; practices he describes in his book can be emulated by individuals in their own skills development. I wanted to ask Vinnie how you reconcile the need to have broad expertise with the problem of becoming a &quot;jack of alll trades, master of none.&quot;</description>

            <title>SAP Business ByDesign Skills and SaaS Consulting Changes - with Ray Tetlow</title>
            <description>I reported on the PAC Feeding the Ecosystem blog that the SAP Business ByDesign (ByD) conversation has shifted from technology debates to product rollout. A key part of that shift is taking a closer look at the skills needed to support ByDesign implementations and the different economics of SaaS consulting. One emerging voice in that conversation is Ray Tetlow of Skyytek. Ray spoke as an early ByD partner at SAPPHIRENOW Orlando. During this forty-seven minute podcast, Ray hits me with some rapid-fire answers to a slew of key ByD questions, such as how he intends to train ByD professionals, why SaaS consultants are easier to bring up to speed in ByD than &quot;on-premise&quot; SAP consultants, and the appeals and drawbacks of the SaaS consulting model.</description>

Andy starts by putting Jon on the JonERP hot seat and getting his conference reactions to SaaS/Business ByDesign, Sybase, and certification, then Jon returns the favor with questions to Andy on his conference takeways. Jon also surprises Andy with a question about how Oracle/JDE and SAP consultants compare.</description>

            <description>What&apos;s the latest on SAP certification? How did the Mentors fare on the SAPPHIRE floor and what did they learn in their conversations with SAP executives and ASUG members? And what are the keys to navigating a successful SAP career in the midst of technical change and skills commoditization? That&apos;s a meaty menu for a podcast!

            <title>SAP Solution Manager Roundtable - Hype Meets Reality</title>
            <description>When you begin a podcast, you never know how it will turn out. I had high hopes that the combined voices of Jim Spath, Tony de Thomasis, and Phil Avelar would advance the Solution Manager conversation with new insights and a clash of perspectives, but you never know. The end result exceeded my own expectations. With good humor but a frank style that underscored their different perspectives, these guys nailed it. We taped this four way, fifty minute podcast on Skype, and while the sound quality is solid, there is the occasional piece of background noise. I think you&apos;ll find that any occasional sound blips are more than worth it for the caliber of the content.</description>

            <title>Jon Reed Interviews SAP Mentor Gretchen Lindquist on ASUG 2009 and SAP Security Trends</title>
            <description>Sometimes in the glitz of Sapphire announcements, the ASUG part of ASUG/Sapphire gets less attention. To learn more about why the ASUG part of the conference matters - not only to SAP users, but to industry analysts - I invited Gretchen Lindquist, SAP Mentor and stalwart ASUG volunteer, to share her views on ASUG/Sapphire 2009 and the pros and cons of co-location. I also had the opportunity to ask Gretchen about trends in SAP Security from the vantage point of her work as chair of the SAP Security Interest Group (SIG) for ASUG.</description>

            <title>Jon Reed Interviews Vijay Vijayasankar on the Impact of Offshoring and SAP BPX Skills</title>
            <description>On March 20 of 2009, I spoke with Vijay Vijayasankar, Senior Managing Consultant at IBM and fellow SAP Mentor, and conducted one of the most important podcasts I have done since I started doing them almost two years ago. On my mind during the taping: my theory that SAP consulting is not just being impacted by the economy and will come roaring back later. I believe the changes in SAP consulting that are underway now are permanent in nature, and have implications for all SAP professionals. There was no one better to ask about these shifts than Vijay, who has broad market experience and has seen many of the changes I am talking about. Disclaimer: please keep in mind that the opinions Vijay expresses during this podcast are entirely his, and do not represent the view of his employer, IBM.</description>

            <title>SAP Tech Skills Chat with the Enterprise Geeks - TechEd Live Without a Net</title>
            <description>At SAP TechEd, I was involved with numerous video shoots and podcast tapings. But my favorite from the conference stands out clearly: this live SAP tech skills chat with the Enterprise Geeks. What stood out about this taping? It was live, without a net, talking without any script or planning on the future of SAP technical careers - with a live audience asking us questions and watching to see if our material and views were credible.</description>

            <title>One Man&apos;s Pursuit of His SAP Demo Jam Dream: Interview with Brian Dennett at SAP TechEd 09</title>
            <description>Too often, realizing SAP career dreams is seen as a process of seniority: until you have paid your dues for many years, you won&apos;t see the payback. While hard work is never a bad thing, Brian Dennett of Colgate-Palmolive has a different story: just two years into his SAP career, he was a Demo Jam finalist at SAP TechEd Phoenix 2009 (link to full SAP DemoJam replay). This was a powerful reminder that SAP career success in today&apos;s market has as much to do with late night bursts of content creation as it does with cubicle-based dues paying. To find out more about Brian&apos;s great story and get a view into his own career path, I had the opportunity to tape a live podcast with him at SAP TechEd 2009.</description>

            <title>Why SAP BPM Skillls are in Demand - SAP TechEd Live 2009</title>
            <description>Many still think of SAP BPM as futuristic stuff - images of &quot;business users putting on propeller hats&quot; might be one way to dismiss these trends. That&apos;s why I was excited to do a podcast with SAP&apos;s Greg Chase, who had approached me prior to SAP TechEd Phoenix to tell me about the customers SAP was hearing from who were looking for a type of SAP BPM skill set that was not readily available.</description>

            <title>SAP Enterprise Support, Saas, and Upgrades with Amit Bendov of Panaya</title>
            <description>One of the most controversial issues in the SAP community today is the question of SAP Enterprise Support and whether the support justifies the cost. In the flurry of blog posts on this topic, an important viewpoint can get overlooked: the day-to-day experience of SAP customers. Recently, Panaya, an SAP third party solutions provider, released their 2009 SAP Support Costs Survey. This survey put some meat on the bone of the hot topics in SAP support, such as the cost of support per user, the attitudes towards Enterprise Support, and the key support challenges that SAP users face.</description>

            <title>EPM, GRC, and the Future of SAP in a SaaS World - with Nenshad Bardoliwalla</title>
            <description>SAP is at a serious crossroads. The ERP market is in a state of significant disruption. The down economy has not only slowed sales; it&apos;s created a fertile ground for Software as a Service business models. As I say in the podcast, how SAP responds to these market challenges is going to have a lot to say about its future. Those of us who work in the SAP community have a lot at stake as well. On the consulting side, the commoditization of basic ERP skills is challenging consultants to find a &quot;higher skills ground.&quot;</description>

            <title>Abesh Bhattacharjee of SAP Labs on SAP Development Skills and SAP MII</title>
            <description>What are the keys to becoming a successful SAP developer? Why is SAP MII becoming such an important piece of functionality? And what do technical SAP folks need to learn from functional specialists and vice versa? In this podcast, Jon Reed of JonERP.com gets the answers to these questions with SAP Mentor Abesh Bhattacharjee of SAP Labs. In the debut of a podcast Jon and Abesh have been plotting since last December, Abesh shares the good news of the release of his new book on Implementing and Configuring SAP MII from SAP Press (co-authored by fellow SAP Mentor Dipankar Saha) and gives his insight on the importance of SAP MII and shop floor visibility to SAP users.</description>

            <description>Thomas Wailgum, Senior Editor of CIO.com and the man behind the &quot;Enterprise Software Unplugged&quot; blog, is a self-described &quot;wiseass.&quot; Those who follow his blog know that he isn&apos;t afraid to mix it up a little bit and poke a little fun at ERP heavyeights. What you might not know is that Thomas has been at CIO.com for 13 years - an amazingly long time given the ups and downs of dotcoms and online media. I wanted to get Thomas on a podcast and ask him how the ERP market has changed over his years at CIO.com, what he has learned from his interviews with CIOs, and get his take on the pros and cons of SAP in today&apos;s market. Thomas is also a fun ERP presence on Twitter, so you may want to follow him there.</description>

            <description>What&apos;s the best way to overcome inaccurate perceptions? By gathering comprehensive data. And what&apos;s the best way to put a vendor in context? Study the broader market. Eric Kimberling, President of Panorama Consulting, does both of these things in the ERP space. To get a better handle on keys to SAP project success (and how to avoid failure), as well as the impact of SaaS and the key skills ERP users should be cultivating, I invited Eric to join me and to share Panorama&apos;s findings with JonERP listeners. I also put him on the JonERP hot seat and asked him to make his own recommendations for SAP&apos;s future direction.</description>

During this twenty-six minute interview, Muhammad asks me for my take on what&apos;s hot and what&apos;s not from an SAP skills perspective. He had some excellent questions for me, including the value of certification and whether or not BPM skills can help an SAP consultant.</description>

            <description>Sometimes in the glitz of Sapphire announcements, the ASUG part of ASUG/Sapphire gets less attention. To learn more about why the ASUG part of the conference matters - not only to SAP users, but to industry analysts - I invited Gretchen Lindquist, SAP Mentor and stalwart ASUG volunteer, to share her views on ASUG/Sapphire 2009 and the pros and cons of co-location. I also had the opportunity to ask Gretchen about trends in SAP Security from the vantage point of her work as chair of the SAP Security Interest Group (SIG) for ASUG.</description>

            <description>In a sluggish economy, SAP professionals want to know where the action is. One area that looks promising in 2009: RunSAP and Solution Manager. But there&apos;s a problem: many SAP consultants (and project teams) are not yet clear on how the two products relate, nor are they clear on the skills needed to implement them. To shed light on this topic, Jon interviews Ajay Vonkarey, President of Alphasirius, a company with deep experience in both RunSAP and Solution Manager. Jon specifically invited Ajay to do this podcast because of Ajay&apos;s innovative thinking around RunSAP and Solution Manager skills trends.</description>

            <description>In the last installment in Jon&apos;s &quot;Tech Ed in Review 2008&quot; podcast series, he speaks with Dennis Howlett, SAP Mentor and &quot;Enterprise Irregular&quot; ZDNet blogger.

One highlight of the podcast? Dennis&apos; take on an important TechEd Berlin meeting between the SAP Mentors and SAP executives regarding the future of SAP development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jon counts on Dennis for straight talk about SAP, and this podcast is no exception. In this 26 minute interview, Dennis pulls no punches in his answers to SAP&apos;s co-innovation strategy and its new EcoHub initiative.</description>

            <description>SOA is having a major impact on how SAP professionals look at the skills they need going forward. But why does SOA matter to SAP in the first place?

            <title>Jon Reed Interviews Krishna Kumar and Paul Kurchina on &quot;Green, SAP, and eSOA&quot;</title>
            <description>Gas prices have been flirting with $5 a gallon recently. But as Krishna Kumar of Enterprise Horizons points out in this podcast, when most SAP customers implemented their first SAP systems, prices were closer to $1 a gallon. This massive change in the cost of energy has created both a crisis and an opportunity. On this podcast, we look at the opportunity side of the equation. Jon and Krishna are joined by Paul Kurchina, Director of the Kurmeta Group, and author of the recently released book In Pursuit of the Perfect Plant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The three of us take a closer look at the intersection between the corporate &quot;Green Movement&quot; and eSOA, and how these converging technologies are having a beneficial impact on the bottom line, while charting a better course for global energy consumption. Paul and Krishna also explain how SAP professionals can get more involved in the Green/eSOA space - a potentially great way to mix skills expansion with purposeful work.</description>

            <description>The SAP market is changing, but one thing remains a constant: the need for quality SAP professionals with the right skills combinations.

&lt;br /&gt;
Sit in with Jon and Kent as they discuss Kent&apos;s keys to attracting and retaining SAP talent, how SAP developers can stay relevant on projects and reduce the risk of being outsourced, and how Kent&apos;s project team has developed a different way of obtaining &quot;buy in&quot; for eSOA projects, building support &quot;from the bottom up.&quot; Kent also talks about the tools SAP professionals need to master to stay relevant, and how his project finds the right mix between outside consultants and internal training.</description>

            <description>Continuing his ongoing podcast series with SearchSAP, Jon Reed interviews Marco ten Vaanholt, Global Director of the SAP BPX Community, for a compelling look at the changing SAP skill set and what it takes to become a &quot;Business Process Expert.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the podcast, Marco describes his work with the SAP BPX community, and how BPX is working collectively to help define the skill set that SAP professionals will need to stay relevant on both the functional and technical side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jon asked Marco to be on this podcast because during TechEd 2007, Marco&apos;s presentation on becoming an SAP Business Process Expert (BPE) provided the most practical &quot;next steps&quot; for how an SAP consultant can evolve their skills that Jon had yet seen. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Marco came through on this podcast with an excellent overview of how the SAP market is changing, how BPX is supporting the SAP skills transition, and what consultants can do to keep their skills in line with the market.</description>

            <title>Jon Reed Interviews Krishna Kumar on SAP TechEd 2007</title>
            <description>To get an inside look at the key developments from SAP TechEd 2007, Jon Reed sat down with Krishna Kumar of Enterprise Horizons. Krishna was a presenter at TechEd 2007, and he is becoming a thought leader in the SAP community in terms of how to get a real return on investment from eSOA and Enterprise Services. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a technical visionary who has watched SAP&apos;s product line evolve for many years, Krishna has a knack for breaking down SAP technology in simple and precise terms. Jon turned to Krishna to help sort through what was real and what was hype at TechEd 2007.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The goal of the podcast was to place the events of TechEd 2007 in the context of SAP&apos;s &quot;Enterprise SOA&quot; technology stack. SAP is clearly staking its future on eSOA, but what does that mean to the SAP project team and the SAP consultant?</description>
