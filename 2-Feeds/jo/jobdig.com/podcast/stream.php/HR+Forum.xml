How do I deal with the Queen Bee Syndrome?  I work in HR.  My boss consistently places the blame rather than solve the problem.  There are not any hard, written procedures on how to deal with various scenarios to provide direction on completing reports or objectives.

She does not trust me, and I am losing trust with her secreting information from me that which is a part of my job.  Somehow, I see the tactics as insecurity on her part and a way of protecting her position.  

The CFO stated recently that he does not want any &quot;Turf Wars.&quot;  I do not believe that he is aware of how my boss is handling the situation.  The turf seems to be getting more difficult every day.</description>
