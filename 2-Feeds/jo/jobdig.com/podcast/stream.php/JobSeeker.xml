Many people can't let go of something that happened A long time ago. Maybe it was a conversation you had, or didn't have. Maybe it was a project you should have taken, or one that you let pass by. Maybe it was something you said on an interview, or didn't say. Everyone has &quot;something&quot; in their career that they wish they could change. So, know that you are not alone. It's not what happened that matters most now, but what you do going forward.</itunes:summary></item><item><title>Resume Mistakes Can Cost You The Job</title><description>Recently I was assisting an employer with the hiring process and reviewed many resumes that were sent in.

I can envision up to 15 qualified professionals each asking the interviewer for the job.

If everyone jumps through the same hoop, performing like a good little circus monkey, what's going to set you apart from other candidates?</description>
