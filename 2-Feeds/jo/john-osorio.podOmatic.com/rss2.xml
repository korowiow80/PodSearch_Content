      <title>Liquid Groove</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1005544/600x600_5353157.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Liquid Groove studio mix project allowed me to delve deeper into re-fix editing within Ableton Live. This time around, I relied heavily on edit re-arrangements which helped me re-shape the mix to give more flexibility and artistic expression creating a unique overall feel of the set. The peaks and valleys within the mix are a byproduct of the arrangement process which was constructed to reflect a more poetic foundation inherent within my musical mind's eye thus allowing the listener a harmonic connection to the overall flow.

The track selections carry themselves into each other with each drop and break down to eventual build up. I managed to dial the BPM tempo down to a more chill groovy house vibe which allowed for more deepness to come through. With this said, the project continues to maintain the digital jackin funk that has been prevalent in my current personal taste these days. That is to say, the styles represented in this mix capture the essence of what I currently produce, or of what I currently perform.

Crafting this studio set took my nearly two months, and it has been a labor of love reflecting the careful attention given to each and every track selected for the listener's enjoyment. It is literally a &quot;Liquid Groove.&quot; I do hope you enjoy it.If you do, please let me know by providing feedback, or by sharing it with your friends within your social media networks.

Cheers and enjoy the gift of music...

      <title>Funky Beat Astronaut</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1005544/600x600_4213314.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes... it's been a while since I've posted a mix, but I haven't been asleep at the wheel! First and foremost I want everyone to know that they can follow me on various platforms on the World Wide Web:

-- http://soundcloud.com/mixchemist 
-- http://mixcrate.com/mixchemist 
-- http://mixcloud.com/mixchemist 
-- @mixchemist on Twitter

There are a good number of mixes posted out there (this one included) which you can stream or download in High Quality (@320K), so do it... you know you want to!

Let's get down to business... Funky Beat Astronaut is a funky mixture of &quot;street&quot; House with a hint of disco and a peppering of breaks. I toiled with remixing/editing the track arrangement for about a week before I dropped them in Ableton to mix &amp; mash up. If you are familiar with the tracks selected in the play-list, you'll noticed I shorten them, and in some cases completely re-arrange tracks to preserve flow in the set.

Concept-wise, I wanted to create a polished structured energy for this studio mix, and I think this set achieves that goal by concentrating the majority of the tunes within one theme, or key. For a good part of the project I selected tracks in A minor and C major, but I also managed to insert tracks with signatures a few keys up and down the scale to give the set more organic variation. Vocals are also a critical component to the mix as it adds the human element to the set, and you'll hear samples galore with heavy effects added throughout.

The mastering was achieved by using Wave's L1, PSP's Vintage Warmer and a bit of standard EQ work to give the mix space eliminating offensive frequencies thus allowing for a clean listening environment.

If you like this mix, please let me know by providing feedback, or you can just be a voyeur and not say anything... ha ha!

As always...Enjoy the &quot;Gift&quot; of Music...

      <title>Funk-Melange</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1005544/600x600_3181109.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funk Melange is a mixture of Funk, Disco, House and Breaks that gets your booty moving and shaking to the syncopation of beats and basslines from the very start of Chuck Roberts Acappella to Nathan Stewart's Sweet Spot.  It is truly a bright and shiny Funk compilation that takes the listener deep into the mix of my personal interpretation of this warm and organic style. 
 

Within my many years of production study, I have found Ableton to be an incredible tool for creating &quot;mix productions.&quot; I call them productions because of the total and absolute control the producer/DJ has at his fingertips allowing him to take the mix in whatever direction he feels necessary to literally control the vibe. Don't like a part of a track?  That's okay... snip snip tuck tuck, add some beats/percussion, write a synth line/bassline over it, and viola, you have a transition that gels with your next track (or a short track that is all your own.)  My experimentation doesn't end there though, with the recent addition of the Akai APC-40 midi controller to my studio, the mixes will continue to get incredibly deeper and deeper.  Soon, I will have enough in my repertoire to take this style of mixing on the road to perform &quot;live.&quot;  I will certainly enjoy that day when it finally arrives!  

In the meantime take the time to listen, and if you like what you hear, always remember to do your part &amp; recommend, favourite, comment then follow.  Spread the Funk and unleash it because it's good for you!

      <title>Classic Summer Sounds</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1005544/600x600_672758.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mix was done the old fashioned way... It's a straight turntable mix...No Ableton, No Serato, No Mp3's, No Wav files, nada... it's clean, it's simple and to the point.  I wanted to post this piece to demonstrate some performance skills  and pay homage to the old turntable media.  I miss the roundness of vinyl, I miss the warmth of its sound, I miss the fidelity it produces, but honestly, I don't miss the price tag of the vinyl format.  I remember dropping hundreds of dollars monthly just to put together a decent set... Thankfully those days have gone by the wayside, and putting together smart sets don't cost as much anymore.  To further add, production vehicles such as Ableton, have allowed us to put our OWN music in our mixes... NOW that I like even more!

Be sure to check the show out the 2nd week of February 2007 as there will be a new Ableton produced down-tempo mix uploaded.  In the meantime enjoy this classic summer mix circa 2004

Cheers!

      <itunes:summary>This mix was done the old fashioned way... It's a straight turntable mix...No Ableton, No Serato, No Mp3's, No Wav files, nada... it's clean, it's simple and to the point.  I wanted to post this piece to demonstrate some performance skills  and pay homage to the old turntable media.  I miss the roundness of vinyl, I miss the warmth of its sound, I miss the fidelity it produces, but honestly, I don't miss the price tag of the vinyl format.  I remember dropping hundreds of dollars monthly just to put together a decent set... Thankfully those days have gone by the wayside, and putting together smart sets don't cost as much anymore.  To further add, production vehicles such as Ableton, have allowed us to put our OWN music in our mixes... NOW that I like even more!

Be sure to check the show out the 2nd week of February 2007 as there will be a new Ableton produced down-tempo mix uploaded.  In the meantime enjoy this classic summer mix circa 2004

Cheers!
