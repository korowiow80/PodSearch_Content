			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_355" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/when-are-people-going-to-see-me-for-what-i-am-an-impostor/women-w-white-mask-half-face-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-355"><img src="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Women-w-white-mask-half-face1-150x150.jpg" alt="Impostor" title="Women-w-white-mask-half-face" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-355" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Impostor</p></div>I’ve heard this question many times from clients. It might be a guy who became a teacher because he didn’t know what else to do but, truthfully, he doesn’t like working with kids every day. Instead, he sees all the flaws in the system and is inclined to be a catalyst for change, making suggestions, getting others involved in projects to improve things.</p>
<p>But, he doesn’t dare presume to do so because he doesn’t have the qualifications or credentials to speak or act according to his natural inclinations.  “Why would anyone listen to me?”</p>
<p>Or, it might be a woman who rose from Receptionist to VP.  She has a gift for<br />
managing others, for harnessing their strengths, talents, preferences, and<br />
motivations of others.  She is adept at determining what sort of work people<br />
are suited for, what will encourage them, and how their talents may be used to<br />
further corporate goals and objectives.</p>
<p>But everyday she goes to work thinking, &#8220;I’m not a REAL manager because I lack<br />
an MBA or other degree, formal training, piece of paper, recognition that tells<br />
me and others what I am, and when people find out that I have no credentials<br />
other than what I&#8217;ve done, I will be cast out!&#8221;</p>
<p>In both cases, our social self is talking.  Think about this for a minute.  We<br />
are swallowed up by the world and its systems and values. Society hands us<br />
templates for acceptance.  This is the development of the social self—that part<br />
of us that wants desperately to “fit in” to society.</p>
<p>We are, after all, social beings who want to be liked and loved by others. We<br />
spend our lives trying to become someone that people will like or look up to.<br />
In doing so, we sometimes harbor feelings of inadequacy&#8211;we’re not competent<br />
enough, sooner or later we’ll be exposed for what we are—a fraud!</p>
<p>This impostor syndrome is a psychological  phenomenon in which individuals are<br />
unable to own up to their strengths, or their accomplishments.  It causes them<br />
to feel like a fake, with a public face of competence that everyone sees, but<br />
another private face of anxiety, worry, or fear.  Instead of feeling like an<br />
integrated whole, they feel fragmented, compartmentalized, or conflicted about<br />
who they are and what they do.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because  we want to be recognized and rewarded for our authentic self.  This is<br />
our natural desire as human beings.</p>
<p>The word authentic is related to the notion of  truthfulness—it’s about being<br />
genuine, honest, faithful, reliable, the real thing.  In philosophical terms,<br />
it’s about living a life that is purposeful, meaningful, significant, in which<br />
your being is aligned with your doing.</p>
<p>We want to experience congruence between who we are and what we do.  We feel<br />
like impostors when are feelings are grounded in what we ‘can do’ or &#8216;have to,&#8217;<br />
instead of our natural strengths.</p>
<p>Being authentic for some, like the teacher mentioned above, is to acknowledge<br />
that teaching is not what he really wanted in the first place.  He might not<br />
know what he wants specifically, but he knows generally that he wants more of a<br />
fit between who he is and what he does for a living.</p>
<p>By focusing on those times in his life when he’s doing what he enjoys most and<br />
doing it well, and having those stories analyzed by a story expert like myself,<br />
he can get an accurate and reliable picture of his right work and have it<br />
matched to the kinds of work that will recognize, reward and motivate him for<br />
what he does naturally and effortlessly.</p>
<p>Each day his ideas, assumptions, beliefs about reality are being shaped by a<br />
job experience that forces him to do something he does not want to do.  He<br />
needs to see how his strengths match up to better jobfits, ones that are<br />
financially viable and attainable without further education.  When he does, he<br />
will have a vocabulary to communicate to others with clarity and confidence how<br />
he can add value to an organization as a catalyst.</p>
<p>For the receptionist turned VP, an analysis of her stories will create  a<br />
picture of her full motivational pattern.  She will see how she cannot do what<br />
she was born to do in terms of taking overall responsibility for accomplishing<br />
a goal or getting something done through actively directing or managing the<br />
efforts of others.</p>
<p>In the past, she may have been criticized by a parent or another significant<br />
person in life; perhaps, her natural strength was not appreciated or approved<br />
by them; or, perhaps the expression of her natural talents was not appropriate<br />
in certain social situations and caused problems.</p>
<p>Our strengths have a flip side; in some situations they are actually a weakness<br />
or detriment to our goals, e.g. treating your siblings, friends, spouse or<br />
children as employees who must operate or perform in the manner that you have<br />
identified as most effective, might produce results at work but creates<br />
friction on the home front.</p>
<p>By getting an accurate picture of her motivational pattern, she can leverage<br />
her strengths in a more conscious and direct manner into her job and delegate<br />
her non-strengths to others that complement her strengths, thereby increasing<br />
her managerial effectiveness, instead of letting her feelings of inadequacy<br />
drive her performance.</p>
<p>Do you feel like an impostor?  Relax.  You can integrate your being with your<br />
doing.</p>
<p>The understanding you need to do so is closer than you might think, right under<br />
your nose, in the facts, people and events of your personal story.</p>
<p>There is no need to suffer stress, worry, anxiety or fear about your work<br />
identity.  You are not a fraud!</p>
<p>The truth of who and what you are in terms of work will launch you to a new<br />
level of success, one that will support and energize you to work with more<br />
clarity and power.</p>
<p>You can be who you are and do what comes naturally for a living!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/you-cant-cheat-life/roll-the-dice_opt/" rel="attachment wp-att-344"><img src="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/roll-the-dice_opt-150x150.jpg" alt="roll-the-dice_opt" title="roll-the-dice_opt" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-344" /></a>&#8220;I really HATE my job!&#8221;  This is a phrase I hear almost every day as a career consultant who works with individuals in career transition. For example, when Elizabeth came to see me, she was 52 years old and had been working since her teens, and almost 30 years as a public servant sitting in front of a computer all day as an information analyst.</p>
<p>Her job required her to process about 90 email messages a day, plus 120 pages of info from the Internet, plus another 20 &#8220;alert&#8221; messages from subscriber-based services.  She estimated only 10 of these 200+ messages were truly relevant to her job.  She felt &#8220;stuck&#8217; in her cubicle reading all day.  She wasn&#8217;t the only one suffering from information overload.  Of the 10 analysts employed in her section, 5 were on long-term stress leave.  </p>
<p>Elizabeth herself appeared very fit and healthy.  But she felt trapped in her job.  She wanted help but felt severely constrained by her life circumstances. When she told me in no uncertain terms: &#8220;I hate my job!&#8221;  I asked her what she did with all that negative energy?  Was there an effigy of her boss that she could punch and kick during her lunch hours in order to discharge her frustration?  No.</p>
<p>There are only two ways to process that kind of negative energy.  One is to explode, such as the worst cases of “going postal” when a worker shoots his co-workers or boss.  The other way is more common:  we implode and the negative energy manifests in stress and dis-ease.</p>
<p>Although Elizabeth had a strong desire to do something, she felt unable to do anything because (1) she was only 3 years away from taking early retirement, and (2) she had two teenage children who aspired to a university education and needed her financial assistance. She felt compelled to continue down the same path.  I have a lot of compassion for individuals who feel trapped in this kind of employment situation: damned if they do leave their job (and risk financial insecurity) and damned if they don&#8217;t leave (and risk their health).  It is sometimes called the dilemma of ‘golden handcuffs.’</p>
<p>Every 6 or 12 months, I&#8217;d contact Elizabeth for an update, asking her how she was coping.  After two years, I got an email from her sister saying Elizabeth could not reply because doctors had found a tumor in her brain the size of a lemon.  Three months later (and 2 years after we met) I cut her obituary from the newspaper and closed her file.  She made it to age 54.  Like many people in her situation, she never collected that precious pension.</p>
<p>Her story inspires me to keep doing what I do. According to the <a href="http://www.who.int/mental_health/management/depression/definition/en/">World Health Organization</a>, depression is the number one cause of disability in North America.  It costs employers more money in lost productivity than any other illness. And the costs to society, in general, are huge.  We all know someone who is defeated by their job, perhaps a family member who is crushed by their job; or, a friend who is underemployed and humiliated by the mundane, boring, and repetitive tasks of their work; or, a colleague who has been rendered impotent by the hierarchical structures of the institution he or she works in.</p>
<p>I work with scores of people every year struggling with burnout, depression, confusion, and cynicism. In almost all cases involving lengthy career pain, there is a serious degradation in the energy levels, health condition, peace of mind, self-confidence, courage, self-respect, happiness, freedom, and other aspects of their personal well-being. That negative energy has to go somewhere, and the sad truth is, it often turns against our bodies in the form of serious lifestyle illnesses.  I am not suggesting that Elizabeth’s career pain caused her cancer but I know darn well that it contributed!  You can’t cheat life!</p>
<p>However, some individuals have heard Elizabeth’s story and told me they would trade places with her in a heartbeat.  They would relish the opportunity to sit in front of a computer every day reading emails in order to collect a public service salary and pension.  For some reason, they believe they are impervious to the very pressures and stresses that undermined the well-being of Elizabeth and her colleagues.</p>
<p>Common sense defies their assumption.  They too would experience stress, possibly burnout.  However, the stress of struggling to pay bills, looking for jobs, coping with unemployment also takes a toll on health and well-being.  The sad reality is that many individuals are managing career pain of one kind or another. If your work experience is full of pain, why not suffer in a cash-for-life public service job?  This reasoning is rooted in a belief that work is suppose to hurt, that’s just the way it is.  The temptation to cheat life is strong.  Roll the dice, and hope you beat the odds and actually get a chance to collect your pension and enjoy a long, healthy retirement. </p>
<p>There is another way to approach your career.  You don’t need to roll the dice and gamble away your life force.  We can approach career choice systematically, with deliberate intentions to make the most of our talents and motivations.  We can identify and define work settings that will recognize, reward and motivate us for what we do naturally and easily.  We can identify specific job titles that best match our unique combination of talents, motivations, acquired skills, experiences, values and priorities.  It&#8217;s a wonderful day when we can say in all honesty, &#8220;I know who I am and I&#8217;m glad I am me.&#8221;  This takes courage in a world that is constantly trying to make us into something else.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/fear-is-a-paper-tiger/paper-tiger/" rel="attachment wp-att-324"><img src="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/paper-tiger-150x150.jpg" alt="paper tiger" title="paper tiger" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-324" /></a>Most of the people I work with already have a job but they want to change careers.  They often say to me, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to have job joy, but I have these fears.&#8221;   What are they afraid of, exactly?</p>
<p>Usually, it’s the fear of negative consequences, i.e. if I quit my current job, even though I hate it, I will lose my regular paycheck, my comfortable lifestyle, and end up on the streets homeless and impoverished.</p>
<p>No one should quit a job until they have an accurate or reliable <a href="http://www.jobjoy.com/jobjoy_report.php">picture</a> of specific jobs in specific work settings that suits them.  That’s the first step in any career transition.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is there to be afraid of in putting together that picture?<br />
You still have your job, so you’re not facing immanent poverty. You probably<br />
aren&#8217;t afraid of succeeding, (although, the rare person might have some of<br />
that). So, it must be that you are afraid of not succeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Barry&#8217;s example</strong></p>
<p>Let me illustrate with a hypothetical but typical example.  Barry is a public<br />
servant with a comfortable job, but keen to get out of this job and into<br />
something more stimulating because “it&#8217;s way too bureaucratic, too boring, too<br />
slow.  One guy described it as a 30-year sentence. When I look at the big<br />
picture, I don&#8217;t doubt him.”</p>
<p>Barry loves public speaking, and is a natural showman, using his physical<br />
skills to impress people, e.g. he can hip-hop dance with backflips and other<br />
gymnastic moves, and this from a 40-year-old man!</p>
<p>We craft a vision to get him started in public speaking, but he can’t take the<br />
actions necessary to move forward with his plan.  “When I think about the<br />
speaking industry, I&#8217;m having trouble believing there&#8217;s an industry for it. ”<br />
Clearly, there is a public speaking industry with professionals who make a<br />
full-time living at it. That’s the reality, so it must be that Barry doesn’t<br />
believe that he can make a living at it.</p>
<p>In order to overcome his fear of failure, Barry talks about how he wants to get<br />
on the public speaking circuit, to do this or that with his life. And then he<br />
says,</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am afraid of taking risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the risk?” I ask.</p>
<p>&#8220;Losing my financial security.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Fear and Ego</strong></p>
<p>For folks who like talking about fear and risks, it&#8217;s hardly ever life and<br />
death. They are not astronauts or surgeons or bounty hunters or demolition<br />
experts where the word risk means something. They just don&#8217;t want to look like<br />
a fool to themselves and others. This is called ego.  They are making it about<br />
themselves, not the creation they want to make.</p>
<p>Fear-based concepts are always tied up in ego, which is where we hold all kinds<br />
of concepts about reality, most of which are not true, but are necessary to<br />
maintaining our particular identity.</p>
<p>You can believe all kinds of things, but if they rob you of the motivation<br />
necessary to take action that moves you towards what really matters to you,<br />
then those beliefs are limitations to getting what you want out of life.  In<br />
reality, those limitations are usually paper tigers &#8211;  things that seem as<br />
threatening as a tiger, but are really harmless. As I already pointed out, when<br />
you already have a job, there is no real risk in exploring other options.</p>
<p>If you act as if changing careers is a life or death issue, then you are not in<br />
touch with reality. This is what happened to Barry: by assuming that public<br />
speaking is so “risky” that he must guard against involvement, he limits his<br />
choices, and cuts off his chances of realizing a new, exciting, and lucrative<br />
career. By making it about his beliefs rather than what he wants to create, he<br />
stops himself before he gets started. His future becomes a self-fulfilling<br />
prophecy of failure.</p>
<p>What are the possibilities if you pursue what you want? There are two: you<br />
accomplish the result you want; you don&#8217;t accomplish the result you want.  Hard<br />
to see what there is to be afraid of so far.  The worst that can happen is that<br />
you don&#8217;t make it.</p>
<p><strong>Blowing over tigers</strong></p>
<p>Everybody fails at something in life, that’s normal.  In fact, psychologists<br />
tell us that we fail more often than succeed.  Our egos can take a hit and<br />
survive.  Conversely, we have all succeeded at things too.  We can learn to<br />
replicate success, to take effective actions to create a new career.</p>
<p>Fear is just another feeling, and a natural one that accompanies change of any<br />
kind.  So, if you are thinking about changing careers, then you will feel some<br />
fear but your feelings, good, bad, or indifferent, are not the measurement of<br />
how well you are doing at creating what matters to you.</p>
<p>Don’t focus on your feelings or beliefs, they might paralyze you.  Recognize<br />
the paper tiger that blocks your way forward. Just blow on it…and it topples.<br />
Then you are free to move on and make choices.</p>
<p>What matters is not your beliefs or your feelings, but only whether or not your<br />
next action moves you closer to your goal.  If it does, you’re ready to take<br />
another action; if it doesn’t then think about what you learned from it,<br />
determine what might be a more effective action, then take it.  This is how to<br />
change careers successfully.  This is how Barry, or anybody else, can move<br />
towards what matters to them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/s%e2%80%a6t%e2%80%a6r%e2%80%a6e%e2%80%a6t%e2%80%a6c%e2%80%a6h-your-ambition-to-succeed/stretchexercise1_opt/" rel="attachment wp-att-308"><img src="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/StretchExercise1_opt-150x126.jpg" alt="StretchExercise1_opt" title="StretchExercise1_opt" width="150" height="126" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-308" /></a>Another year has started.  Did you promise yourself that this is the year, now is the time to change careers?  You feel ready to make a real change in your life. </p>
<p>Changing careers requires some internal and external stretching to get you where you want to go.  In the same way that stretching physically helps prepare your bones and muscles for more vigorous activity, we need to stretch our ideas and actions in order to transform our career into a better jobfit, one that will recognize, reward, and motivate us for what we do naturally and effortlessly.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Stretch your ideas</strong>.  One of the biggest obstacles we face when thinking about a new career is a shortlist of options.  Most people can only think of 30 jobs off the top of their head—teacher, lawyer, doctor, dentist, postman, policeman, professonal athlete, singer, secretary, baker, banker, and the jobs we see or encounter on a daily basis.  But there are 60,000+ jobs operating in our economy and the truth is there is not one perfect job for you (perfection is an illusion) but up to several dozen jobs that you are suited for…if you only knew what they were.  Getting a proper assessment of your natural talents and motivations, combined with your existing education, experience, values, priorities—can open the door to many exciting career options, not to mention several excellent jobs that you can transition into quickly and easily.  </p>
<p>2. <strong>Expand your talents into a track record</strong>.  You may have a knack for public speaking but you can’t be a competent and accomplished public speaker unless you seek opportunities to speak with your authentic voice.  It’s hard to convince others of your knack for marketing unless you can design and deliver some impressive marketing collaterals.  To succeed with a career change, your talents must be developed into skills through genuine effort to meet some real goals. </p>
<p>3. <strong>Take the time necessary for expansion</strong>.  You’ve probably heard the old cliche that every overnight success took 20 years.  Transformation does not occur overnight.  Too many people kill their dreams by quitting too early.  They want the rewards now.  But taking responsibility for what you truly want from life requires time to plant and harvest.  If you’re not willing to invest some time and energy then I suggest you don’t really want a new career; instead, you probably want to replace your current income with something that is not as stressful, or as toxic, or as boring, or as [you fill in the blank].  Avoiding something you don’t want is not the same thing as creating something you do want.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Embrace the creative process</strong>.  Creating is a process that follows a proven format :  come up with a clear vision of a new career; look at where you are now clearly and objectively; then take effective actions to move you closer from where you are now to where you want to be in the future.  That’s it.  The creative process is not rocket science, anybody can do it.  But the key is to <em>do</em> it.  Take effective actions that move you closer to what you want.  Don’t waste time, energy or money by taking no action, or only a little action, or ineffective action.  Life is too short.  Commit to your transformation.  Perhaps you can move forward more quickly by getting help.  </p>
<p>Are you still feeling resistance to stretching your ambition, to grabbing the internal or external bull by the horns, and wrestling it to the ground once and for all?  Perhaps this is the year when you take deliberate, intentional and proven actions that move you forward.</p>
<p>Help is available to help you seize the day and stretch beyond what you thought possible. </p>

<p>I recently performed in a musical theatre production of ‘The Gifts of the Magi,’ a story about a young married couple—Jim &#038; Della Dillingham—who are living in New York in 1905 when Christmas rolls around and they have no money to buy each other gifts to express their love. </p>
<p>They have hit hard times because Jim is unemployed and Della gets a little sewing work now and then. In the end, the buy each other gifts that are very meaningul but are made by a huge sacrifice:  Della cuts and sells her beautiful long brown hair in order to buy a watch fob, for the very watch that Jim sells in order to buy Della pure tortoise shell combs for her beautiful long hair!  The fact that each was willing to make such a personal sacrifice for the other demonstrates their deep and genuine love for each other.  It makes no real sense, there is no good reason that explains what Jim and Della did out of love for each other.  Hope and love cannot be reasoned with.</p>
<p>I think the same idea stands behind the notion of doing what you love for a living.  It can’t really be reasoned with.  In fact, there are many good reasons for not doing so, reasons that sound very…well…reasonable.  It’s just too hard, too risky, to pursue what you really want; just accept the fact that you can’t have it and compromise.  Choose a career that is safe and learn to live with it.  [Or, do as I did as Soapy, the bum, in the musical, who does his best to get arrested in order to avoid work!  He's the comic relief...]</p>
<p>But the heart wants what the heart wants; it cannot be reasoned with.  Our life-spirit cries out for vitality, we want to feel engaged with life, living with purpose and meaning.  Is it any wonder that a career compromise often leads to a mid-life crisis, or depression (which is now the number one workplace disability)? I am not denying the fact that for some people there are formidable and genuine obstacles to making a significant change in one’s life.  But, in most cases, the obstacles to moving forward to a life of more vitality may be challenging but not impossible.</p>
<p>What is reasonable, I suggest, is to learn how to create what you truly want without compromise. What is not reasonable is to surrender to compromise, to give up on your natural talents and motivations, or the chance to explore the fullness of who and what you are in terms of your right work, or your highest aspirations and deepest values…it’s never too hard or too late. </p>
<p>The way I approach this issue with my clients is to separate what they enjoy doing both at work and outside of work from what they think is only possible. This is critical.  Most people can only think of 30 jobs off the top of their heads, and if none of those jobs light a fire in them, then they use this as an excuse not to explore their options further.  For example, there are over 60,000 jobs operating in our economy, with new ones being created every day because almost 50% of jobs are created for individuals who have a particular set of unique talents and skills. My job is to help identify and define those many opportunities, and develop a plan to move you into a better jobfit according to your time and priorities.</p>
<p>So here is a reasonable question: Is it reasonable to give up before you have had a chance to see what kinds of jobs you are truly suited for, and before any learning has taken place about how to move from where you are now into a better jobfit or career? I would say that is unreasonable and not terribly practical to squelch the self-honesty about what you might really want in terms of work.  A compromise can close the doors on one of your most important human instincts, the desire to create a career or work that really matters to you.</p>
<p>Hope and love make so many things possible.  That is a gift given to all of us.  We don’t have to settle for a reasonable compromise.  Incredible things occur every day, unlikely, unpredictable, unreasonable things that bring more vitality into the world.  These things are available to you too.  It starts with a commitment to explore your options. Don’t compromise on that creative urg to get an accurate and reliable picture of what you truly want.</p>
<p>Here at JobJoy, we are in the business of helping you get that picture and take effective actions to make it real.  In 2012, you can be in a very different position than you are as 2011 ends.  Our <a href="http://www.jobjoy.com/jobjoy_report.php">JobJoy Report</a> lays the foundation in which you are more able to create what you want in terms of a better career or job.  This <a href="http://instantteleseminar.com/?eventid=20848683">webinar</a> explains how it works as a gift that keeps on giving.  </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><div id="attachment_280" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/the-linkedin-advantage/sixdegrees_opt/" rel="attachment wp-att-280"><img src="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/SixDegrees_opt-150x150.jpg" alt="Networking" title="SixDegrees_opt" width="150" height="150" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-280" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Networking</p></div>Some job experts say that more jobs are now filled online through LinkedIn (LI) than all the job boards combined.</p>
<p>LI is, without a doubt, a major player in online job search; it is here to stay; and it’s influence continues to grow.  If LI were a country, it would be the 12the most populous country in the world!  I recommend that most job searchers learn to use it.  Why?</p>
<p>Hiring practices have changed a lot in the past 10 years because we have moved from an expansionary to a recessionary economy; instead of growing rapidly, the<br />
economy is shrinking slowly.</p>
<p>In an expansionary economy, employers have to hire a lot of people quickly in<br />
order to compete and prosper from selling their products and services.  This<br />
creates a &#8220;sellers market&#8221; with an advantage for job searchers because the<br />
demand for skilled labor outstrips supply.</p>
<p>For example, during the hi-tech boom, employers were looking for skilled labor<br />
in order to push their products out the door.  Job searchers could throw their<br />
resumes online using job boards, or post directly onto company websites, and<br />
if they had skills, experience or training that matched employer needs, they<br />
would get calls from recruiters or employers in a timely manner.</p>
<p>We are in a very different economy now.  Organizations are not expanding, they<br />
are cutting back, and no longer have the same need to hire lots of new<br />
employees.  Supply now exceeds demand.  To throw your resume online and expect<br />
the same response that you may have enjoyed during the hi-tech bubble is an<br />
unrealistic expectation.</p>
<p>And yet, that is exactly what I am hearing these days from so many clients.<br />
Their last job search experience occurred during the hi-tech bubble when it was<br />
relatively easy to get a job through an online job search.</p>
<p>But now, we live with a recessionary economy, a &#8220;buyers market&#8221; for employers,<br />
who no longer have an urgent need to go online to find employees.  Instead,<br />
they can afford to wait for candidates to come to them&#8230;by loading a resume<br />
onto the company website, or through referrals, or through networking.<br />
Employers can take the time to be picky and choosy. They no longer need job<br />
boards or recruiters to the same extent in order to fill the gap between demand<br />
and supply.</p>
<p>This is the reason, at least in part, for the success of LI.   Many managers<br />
themselves are going online to recruit candidates.  They are bypassing<br />
recruiters, even their own HR departments (which have been seriously downsized<br />
as companies cutback overhead), and using the features of LI to troll for<br />
candidates.</p>
<p>Therefore, it makes sense for job searchers to leverage themselves into the<br />
hiring process through LI, which is designed to help managers find you and vice<br />
versa.  How?</p>
<p><strong>Think strategically</strong></p>
<p>You have to join LI in order to use it, but it’s free.  Scroll to the bottom of<br />
their page and select their Learning Center link, which will help you Get<br />
Started and learn how to use LI efficiently and effectively.<br />
You can also use a search engine and type in the Q:  How to use LinkedIn for job<br />
search? And get lots of free advice from videos, webinars, articles, books, and<br />
more.</p>
<p>As the picture with this article shows, you have hundreds, thousands, of people<br />
in your goodwill network who want to help.  Your job is to make it easy for<br />
them to do so.  LI can help.</p>
<p>I specialize in helping clients with job change, with transitions from one<br />
career space to another.  So, before getting active on LI, I advise them to<br />
think about how they want potential employers to view them.</p>
<p>Do not use LI like a job board.  It’s not about posting your resume.  It’s a<br />
business networking tool and designed for that purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should I quit my job?&#8221; is not the first Q to ask yourself when making a career<br />
change.  Instead, think strategically about what you want to do and where to do<br />
it.  Where and what are the two Qs that I help my clients answer in very<br />
specific terms.</p>
<p>LI then can help translate those answers into real job opportunities in real<br />
work settings by identifying communities of interest.  LI will facilitate<br />
connections in that career space.  LI is about managing relationships in a way<br />
that facilitates your professional goals to break into that space.</p>
<p>Have a clear picture of your next career space and how you fit into it.  Know<br />
your value proposition and stay on message or, in the parlance of social media,<br />
stay on brand.  Consistency is the key!  It’s about packaging and positioning<br />
yourself online according to your right work, to the kind of work you most want<br />
to do, and that best suits you.</p>
<p>There is no need to rush into a public profile.  Before you build it, plan it!<br />
Think strategically.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/find-my-dream-job-i-dont-even-know-what-it-looks-like/blindspot/" rel="attachment wp-att-252"><img src="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/blindspot-150x150.jpg" alt="blindspot" title="blindspot" width="150" height="150" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-252" /></a>When it comes to career change, we often focus on the blind spots.</p>
<p>This is especially true if we have been recognized and rewarded for a particular skill, even though the skill might leave us cold<br />
or indifferent when using it to earn our living.</p>
<p>In other words, we confuse the means with the ends, or in JobJoy terms, we confuse a ‘can do’ skill with a motivation.  Let me<br />
explain by illustrating a specific case.</p>
<p>Writing is a skill that is highly valued in our education system.  In school, we all learn how to present ideas, information, narrative or descriptive images using the written word.  Some learn better than others.</p>
<p>These good learners develop strong ‘can do’ skills as a writer and go on to<br />
careers in education (e.g. professor) or the public service (e.g. policy<br />
advisor) or the private sector (e.g. resume writer) that involve a lot of<br />
writing as a core job duty.</p>
<p>Year after year they write reports, papers, letters, and other products.  They<br />
start to think of themselves as a writer because others relate to them that<br />
way, and pay them to write in a job.</p>
<p>Sometimes, this identity that we create for ourselves as a writer actually<br />
makes sense.  For example, I have had many clients who write business or<br />
academic papers very well.  But what really turns them on is creative writing,<br />
involving poetry, plays, or short stories.</p>
<p>Here’s how one client described the benefits of writing a play:  &#8220;I fully<br />
escaped into my writing. Writing made me feel emotions more vividly and<br />
discover feelings long dormant.  With play writing, I came alive. I felt like I<br />
was some kind of vehicle through which material completely outside my awareness<br />
traveled onto the page. I discovered that the more I let the characters loose<br />
on the page, the more they led my writing. This kind of writing was a full-body<br />
experience. I loved feeling so alive and physically sparked. I loved the energy<br />
I got from the activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, after a cathartic release of emotion, she never went on to write more<br />
plays, or other creative writing.  It wasn’t the craft of writing&#8212;the innate<br />
desire to effectively impress what you have to say onto the minds of<br />
readers—that motivated her; instead, it was breaking through emotional<br />
barriers, breaking through the existing limits of experience at that point in<br />
her life.</p>
<p>Writing was the vehicle not the destination.  She went on to an academic career<br />
and had to confront the reality of publish or perish.  She was not motivated to<br />
write academic papers for a living, even though she had been doing it for years<br />
in order to obtain a Master’s and PhD.</p>
<p>As she got older, doing what didn’t come naturally or easily became more<br />
difficult.  She needed to find a different career path.  But how could she find<br />
her dream job, when the only option she could think of involved writing?</p>
<p>Doing so meant she had to stop thinking of herself as a writer.  She needed to<br />
create a new identity for herself, one that harmonized with her natural talents<br />
and motivations.</p>
<p><a href="http://youtu.be/29R2nTUTcRw">Getting clarity</a> about what we do naturally and effortlessly is the first step<br />
to a successful career change.  Then it becomes possible to create a different<br />
picture of yourself at work.  Now you can see possibilities that are stimulating and financially viable!</p>
<p>A career assessment should give you an accurate and reliable picture of what that dream job looks like.</p>
<p>The next step is to find people in that new picture of work, and communicate to  them with confidence your value proposition.</p>
<p>The key is to have others pay you for what comes naturally and effortlessly.  That is job joy!</p>

<p>As a job searcher, it is essential to understand the nature of your relationship with a hiring manager, whether you are meeting him or her in a formal job interview or speaking to them informally in their office, at a conference, at a networking event, or any other venue.</p>
<p>1. <em>The most important person in the hiring process</em></p>
<p>Unless you start your own business and hire yourself, you will always be dependent on someone else to hire you.  That person is the most important person in the hiring process.  We call that person a “hiring manager,” not because they spend all their time hiring—far from it!—but because they have the power to hire you.  The person you report to in any organization is your hiring manager.</p>
<p>2. <em>Hiring managers are human beings too</em></p>
<p>When you go looking for a job, you are preoccupied, naturally and rightfully, with your own needs and priorities&#8211; you want a solid ROI on all that education  and experience you’ve already invested in your career.  You want a job that is fun, or lucrative, or easy, or challenging, or close to home, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p>In the same way, a hiring manager is interested, first and foremost, in protecting and promoting their own career.  And, s/he is not going to make a decision or take an action that might jeopardize their career. Remember, too, that in many cases, managers are not trained to hire (they are trained to manage plans, priorities, programs, projects, budgets, schedules, and so on), or they don’t enjoy hiring, or they are not very good at it.  As human beings, they are looking for an easier way to do things, including hiring.</p>
<p>3.<em> Hiring is a risk assessment exercise</em></p>
<p>Put yourself in their shoes:  they don’t know you.  It is human nature to fear what we don’t know.   To increase your chances of getting hired, it is important to understand the hiring process from their pov.  And, from their pov, the hiring process is a risk assessment exercise. </p>
<p>There is a lot of truth to the old cliche that ‘people hire who they know.’  Managers know that nobody is perfect; everyone has shortcomings, weaknesses, faults, biases, and prejudices–-things that pose a potential threat to the safety of his or her career.  Everyone has a downside.  It is easier to hire somebody you know because it is easier to assess their downside :  &#8220;I know Bob, Janet and Ricardo, each has strengths and weaknesses, but when I look at their shortcomings, can I still manage them? Are they a threat to my career?&#8221;</p>
<p>Think about formal interviews, and how many questions are designed to uncover weaknesses and shortcomings: What is your greatest weakness?  Describe a situation in which you were unsuccessful achieving a goal, and how did you respond?  How would you rate your ability to resolve conflict on a scale of 1 to 10, from low to high, then give me an example?</p>
<p>Sure, managers want employees who are competent in terms of knowledge and skills but those employees aren’t much good to them unless they can manage them easily.  Above all, a hiring decision for a manager is about feeling &#8220;safe&#8221; with them, safe in terms of protecting and promoting their own career as a manager.</p>
<p>4. <em>&#8220;Why should I hire you?”</em></p>
<p>Every job search campaign is a response to this simple question. It&#8217;s one that may be simple to ask, but it&#8217;s difficult to answer, especially when you focus your answer on the &#8220;you&#8221; part of the question. Your first inclination is to start your sales pitch, to convince a manager that you are a good choice. You want to highlight your features and benefits, such as &#8220;I&#8217;m reliable, dependable and hard-working.”</p>
<p>But, the truth is, you will do better in any interview when your focus on this question is on the &#8220;why&#8221; not the &#8220;you.&#8221;</p>
<p>5. <em>Tapping into pain points</em></p>
<p>I realize that this approach is counter-intuitive.  In fact, I ask my clients to write down the phrase, &#8220;It’s not about me!&#8221;&#8230;to remind them of this fundamental principle, since our inclination is almost always to focus on our needs and priorities first; or, our lack of experience, education, or credentials; or, our accomplishments.  These things may be relevant to a successful job search but they should not the primary element of your job search strategy.</p>
<p>Let’s step back for a moment and consider the priorities of a hiring manager again.  Managers are not focused on you when they are thinking of hiring.  They are thinking about their needs and priorities.  Managers are responsible for achieving the goals and objectives of their organizations…that’s why they get paid big bucks, have fancy job titles, and get perks.  However, it is not easy to attain those goals.  If it was easy, they could do all the work themselves and wouldn’t need employees!</p>
<p>But the nature of reality is adversity : things get in the way of corporate goals and objectives, such as problems, challenges, issues and pressures.  To a sales professional, these &#8220;things&#8221; are known as &#8220;pain points.&#8221;</p>
<p>In sales, it is important to understand the goals of your prospects and their pain points in order to determine how your product or service can make their pain go away and reach their goals.  The only difference between sales and job search is that you are the product or service for pain relief! </p>
<p>This is the agenda behind every hiring decision, i.e. the manager is looking for help around specific pain points. Your job in a formal or informal interview is to uncover that agenda.  Once you are in the door, it is important to get a hiring manager talking.  Listen for clues to their pain points.  Respond not with the features of your value proposition (i.e. your education, experience, personal traits) but with benefits (i.e. how you can help them with their pain points).</p>
<p>Obviously, we cannot cover here every possible scenario. I am outlining a strategic approach. The implementation of this strategy is up to you. That is why I strongly suggest that job searchers get professional help. There is a lot at stake in terms of your career. You want to optimize your time and energy.</p>
<p><em>Summary</em></p>
<p>Establish rapport with a manager by focusing on their needs and priorities. What is their agenda? What challenges, issues, problems, pressure points are driving this hiring decision? Flush out concerns. Find out what red flags the employer may have about hiring somebody they don&#8217;t know. Listen carefully for &#8220;sensitive&#8221; questions.</p>
<p>Many times informal interactions with a hiring manager can turn into formal interviews because a manager has a genuine need to hire. They warm up to you as the person asking the questions, and they want to make the most out of their time with you.</p>
<p>The truth is this :  there are always jobs and managers are always hiring.  Be prepared!</p>

He was thinking of switching programs from a BSc in Biology<br />
to something “more practical” like nursing because his two young siblings were in a nursing program that guaranteed a job after graduation.  He didn’t see much prospect of getting a job related to biology without further education, despite the fact that he is currently employed in an internship with one<br />
of the country’s largest health sciences companies!<span id="more-222"></span></p>
<p>Is this quest for job security a simple capitulation to market forces that are<br />
increasing their influence over us in terms of how we think and behave?<br />
Choices have consequences, and each choice constructs a thread that we will<br />
follow daily as we create a story for our life.</p>
<p>This young man views education as an economic goal.  Like most of us, he is<br />
simply following a formula that is considered practical and realistic: good<br />
education = good job, good money, good things.  This is the story he is<br />
living:  we exist in order to buy happiness.</p>
<p>And one of our deepest  fears is that we won’t get our share of the pie.  I<br />
remember that feeling well from my early 20s!  Is that a real fear, or one that<br />
is manufactured by others to serve their interests?</p>
<p>This young man won’t attend convocation ceremonies for another year but perhaps<br />
he should listen to advice given this year to engineering graduates at a local<br />
university by Leonard Lee, the founder and former CEO of a highly successful<br />
international company, <a href="http://leevalley.com">Lee Valley Tools</a>.</p>
<p>“If you go where your passion leads you, you will probably do very well,” he<br />
said, “although it is entirely possible that by doing that, you’ll never be<br />
able to afford that Jaguar.  But believe me, loving your work is more fun than<br />
than driving a Jaguar.”</p>
<p>And he ought to know.  Lee followed the same formula of grades=money; and, like<br />
most people of the middle class, he had a pleasant job that provided a modest<br />
sense of accomplishment, while still giving him time and energy for personal<br />
interests.  Most people would consider this a successful life, and simply<br />
settle in for the long haul as a comfortable  consumer and citizen of an<br />
affluent society.</p>
<p>But if we scratch the surface of comfort, we may find the frustration and<br />
dissatisfaction that drives people like Leonard Lee to change their lives.<br />
That formula of grades=money teaches young people that we can buy happiness in<br />
the face of convincing evidence that we cannot, e.g. drug addiction,<br />
alcoholism, teenage suicide, divorce, loneliness, and other despairs are modern<br />
plagues of the prosperous more than the poor.  We don’t believe it, at least<br />
not until we’re older and the accumulation of this evidence weighs heavily in<br />
the scales of our personal experiences.</p>
<p>The stakes are bigger than just the quality of our individual lives.  That<br />
formula grades=money  enhances runaway consumption and depletion of earth, air,<br />
and water of our planet.  We all pay a price for conspicuous consumption as the<br />
benchmark of success!  Driving a Jaguar is a sign of success.</p>
<p>Leonard Lee was a senior public servant when he quit his job at age 40 to<br />
pursue his love of woodworking.  He placed an ad in <em>Harrowsmith</em> magazine<br />
offering the first 1000-item catalog for $1.  Today, the same core business<br />
earns $100M a year!</p>
<p>Lee is now in his 70s, and has learned what many individuals learn later in<br />
life:  having work that energizes you is better than having things.  Joy is the<br />
source of vitality and a life rich with purpose and meaning.  Making money is a<br />
by-product not the purpose of work.   He’s had the Jaguar and he’s had the Joy;<br />
he says he’ll take the joy any day of the week.</p>
<p>Of course, the old formula grades=money is still true for certain careers, such<br />
as law, medicine, and engineering, where good grades are necessary for<br />
acceptance into professional schools.  And, all sorts of professional<br />
credentials are increasingly used to establish criteria for certain job<br />
postings in government and other large institutions.</p>
<p>But the world of work is changing rapidly due to social and economic pressures,<br />
especially in knowledge sectors, where independent study, community service,<br />
adventures and experience, large doses of privacy and solitude, are shaping the<br />
formation of new kinds of workers and workplaces. (see <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8Yt4wxSblc' >The Future of Work</a>).  Common sense and the human nature of business people prevails in this space, where most hiring and promoting is done the old-fashioned way, using performance and private judgment as the preferred measures.</p>
<p>Finding our place in the world is a function of the story we live.  One script<br />
is being written by our market-driven culture, telling us how to live according<br />
to what we buy.  It takes courage at any age to view this story critically.</p>
<p>Leonard Lee has handed over leadership of Lee Valley Tools to his son.  But he<br />
didn&#8217;t retire like his former public servant colleagues. Why retire from<br />
something you love doing?  Today he is developing <a href="http://www.canica.com">a line of surgical tools</a> for the health care sector.</p>
<p>Years ago, he realized there was a dissonance between his public and personal<br />
stories, his social self and his authentic self.  He took a risk to bring<br />
together what had been pulled apart for the sake of career.  What he got was a<br />
better story, a better life!  That is the message he wants to pass on to all<br />
young people.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/dick_portrait2_opt1-150x144.jpg" alt="dick_portrait2_opt" title="dick_portrait2_opt" width="150" height="144" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-213" />I&#8217;m an idiographer.  You might think I’m an idiot for saying so but idiography is actually the study of individual cases or events.  And that’s what I do as a career professional.  It is a proven, scientifically valid method for career assessment. </p>
<p>I demonstrated this method in some detail recently to colleagues in Las Vegas at the Career Management Alliance conference.  Heres’ what one of them wrote to me after attending my session:<span id="more-211"></span></p>
<p>“I so enjoyed your presentation.  I have long been perplexed by the emphasis career professionals place on assessments.  Although I have a masters in career development, and took a semester course on assessments, I have found them to be of very limited value in the work I do with clients.  Like you, I prefer the story approach as a more effective vehicle to discover the critical subtleties and nuances of their true essence.  Your presentation was a very refreshing change and was much appreciated!”</p>
<p>My clients come to me because they want to make a significant career transition.  In order to help them make on, I ask them to  <a href='http://youtu.be/29R2nTUTcRw' >write stories</a> about times in their life when they are doing what they enjoy most and doing it well.</p>
<p>I then analyze those stories for their key success factors in order to construct an accurate and reliable picture of their right work.  I match this picture to specific jobs in work settings that will recognize, reward and motivate them for what they do naturally and effortlessly.</p>
<p>We then work together on the practical and realistic stuff to move them for where they are now into a better jobfit, one that harmonizes with their motivational pattern.</p>
<p><strong>What is assessment?</strong></p>
<p>Assessment is all about answering two simple questions:  WHERE and WHAT?  Which organization or work setting will motivate me by recognizing and rewarding me for what I enjoy most and do best.  And, what are the job titles in that organization which best match up with my talents, skills, experience, education, and values. </p>
<p>To borrow a sports analogy :  it’s choosing a ballpark to play in, and the position you are best suited to playing.</p>
<p><strong>Two kinds of assessment</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have taken an assessment through school or work have used a <em>nomotheic</em> assessment tool.  That is a technical term for a tool that helps an individual search for general traits or characteristics, such as skills, values, aptitudes, interests, or personality traits. Some of these tools are self-assessment, and others need to be administered by a professional.  But they all use prescribed categories of characteristics and match them to careers.</p>
<p>The <em>idiographic</em> approach is not about particular strengths or traits.  It&#8217;s about the pattern!  At the risk of stating the obvious&#8211;like any meaningful story, our personal stories are greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>But our left-brain, cause-and-effect, linear, engineering-driven world (the mechanistic worldview)  tends to emphasize component parts, instead of spending more time looking for the relationships between the parts (the systemic or holistic worldview).</p>
<p><strong>The pattern of relationship between parts</strong></p>
<p>A personal story has many elements that influence individual behavior, including family of origin dynamics, a sense of place (geography) and time (history), key relationships, major illnesses, attitude to authority, and much more that can influence choices and outcomes.</p>
<p>For me, each component part of a story might be important but they are only important in how they interact when my client is in action doing what they enjoy most.  It&#8217;s the pattern!  And, yes, the component parts that make up the pattern are important.  In my case, I focus on certain key success factors.  That doesn’t mean the others are wasted, not at all. </p>
<p><img src="http://jobjoy.com/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/horse-cart_opt-150x133.jpg" alt="horse-cart_opt" title="horse-cart_opt" width="150" height="133" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-214" />This picture of a man in a cart trying to pull a horse looks ridiculous, doesn’t it?  This person is not going to get far. And yet, this is exactly where many of us end up in our careers because we put the cart in front of the horse.</p>
<p>Worse, yet, we neglect the horse as we develop our careers.  We focus on our social assets, filling our cart with acquired skills, education, credentials, contacts, and so on.  We invest so much time, energy, and money on these elements of career, that we neglect to nurture and develop what the horse represents:  natural strength, vitality, drive, energy, passion!</p>
<p>The story-telling approach to assessment focuses on the horse; that is, it helps our clients to remember and recount times in their lives when they were energized, full of life and vitality.  My job as an idiographer is to show them how those key success factors connect to real jobs in the real world of work, personally rewarding and financially sustainable jobs.</p>
<p>The cart is still their with all its goodies.  What is important is the correct relationship putting the horse in front of the cart.  Now the horse is pulling the cart with passion, drive, strength, and energy.  </p>
<p>Passion and profit are not mutually exclusive!  My job as a career professional is to make this connection real for my <a href="http://www.jobjoy.com/SuccessStories.php">clients</a>.</p>
