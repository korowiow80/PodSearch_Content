            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Two essays that will go into The Book are featured. The first deals with my recollection of President John Kennedy.. He was the hero of many in my parent's generation and the first president I remember.&nbsp; I saw JFK when he campaigned for office and his assassination still is vividly in my memory. The second shares the impact on me of President Barack Obama's recent announced support for same-sex marriage.</p>

We got over 170 advertiser to drop her show in the U.S. and Canada having flooded companies phones, faxes and emails that advertised on her TV show. I discuss the controversies and responses around Rush Limbaugh and Laura Schlessinger and how advertising agencies failed to protect their clients by warning them against running ads on controversial programs. I also explain the science behind purchasing radio and TV Advertising.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">I share the breakup of my thirteen-year marriage to Linda, the coming to terms with my depression and my coming out of the closet. This was an emotionally difficult period of my life but one where I grew stronger by facing my demons. I became a better parent to my son Nathaniel who remained with me after the divorce. Besides those interested in my life this will prove useful for others who are in or have been in mixed-orientatiion (or as I call them, heterosexless marriages) as well as any person dealing with their own coming out issues. Resources for both gay and straight spouses, their children and people coming out of the closet are also mentioned at the end of the podcast.</p>

			<title>Episode 79  - John Selig Outspoken (The Book) - Today Was My Day From Hell</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://johnselig.libsyn.com/episode-79-john-selig-launching-of-john-selig-outspoken-the-book-today-was-my-day-from-hell]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">This is an essay for my upcoming book entitled Today Was the Day from Hell. On January 12th 2012 a newspaper article in Canada's Globe and Mail Newspaper indicating that same-sex marriages in Canada, like Rodolfo's and mine where the couple lived in a country or state that wouldn't perform or recognized same-sex marriages would be invalidated in Canada and treated as if the never occurred. I was in a state of panic all day until I received a joint press release from several LGBT and mainstream organizations including Lambda Legal, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union, Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders and Freedom to Marry assuring same-sex couples married in Canada that our marriages were not in jeopardy and not likely to be. I decided to send an email to family, friends, activists, executive directors of LGBT organizations, elected officials and media friends (over 250 people). and I posted it on my Facebook page for more than 2,000 friends to read The purpose of the letter was to share my feelings of frustration and panic. As many of the people receiving the email were straight I wanted them to understand the challenges that gay people face over issues that straight people take for granted. I decided to turn the email into an essay for my upcoming book.</p>

			<title>Episode 1: Ken Manford of Family Pride, Jeffrey Reid Baker (Musician) and Gay Pride Commentary</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/johnselig/JSO_001_20070717.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Our first interview is with Ken Manford of the Family Pride organization. Ken and his partner Jeffrey Roach adopted their son from Guatemala at the age of 6 months.

Next we will have Jeffrey Reid Baker on. I am quite excited, most podcasts use creative commons licensed. Ours is fortunate in being able to feature some exciting music from a friend that I hadn’t had contact with in over 35 years Jeff is a musician who is both gifted and renown and is from my hometown living a mere 4 blocks from where my grandparents lived while I was growing up. You heard one of Jeff’s pieces as part of John Selig Outspoken’s introduction and you will hear small snippets as segways between different segments of the show. We will also feature one of Jeff’s pieces in its entirety as part of each podcast.

Jeff will be introduced by my lifelong friend, Les Moore, whom I have known for over 40 years. I know, I know, what a great name … Les Moore. I am going to have Les introduce Jeff since it was her brilliant idea to Jeff and I team up together. It has been a real thrill for me to get back in touch with Jeff. He has a sharp mind; a keen wit and I know that you are going to enjoy his music as much as I do.]]></description>
