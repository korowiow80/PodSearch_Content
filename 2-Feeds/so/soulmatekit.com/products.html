																	<br />Today I consider myself one of the most fortunate women I know. I am blissfully married to the most wonderful guy in the world, my soulmate, Brian.<br />
																	<br />
																	But, it wasn’t always this way.  <br />
																	<br />
																	While I had a very successful career as a book publicist and businesswoman, when it came to men I always seemed to end up with FROGS!  <br />
																	<br />
																	Then one day I made a decision to figure out how to manifest my very own Prince.  I decided to use the manifestation formulas that had worked so well in my career.  I became crystal clear about the type of man I desired and the type of partnership and relationship we would have together. I cleared out the clutter in my house AND in my heart. <br />
																	<br />
																	I learned and invented techniques, rituals, visualizations and prayers that helped me prepare my body, mind, spirit and home for an amazing relationship.  And they worked. I met my husband, Brian, who has exceeded all of my desires and expectations. He was and is everything I ever wished for.   <br />

														As someone who didn't meet and marry my soulmate until I was 44, I learned a lot along the way about what does and doesn't work in the world of love and romance. Creating the Soulmate Kit was my way of documenting the process I used so I could share the secrets with others. It's also a way for me to provide HOPE FOR THOSE WHO FEEL HOPELESS IN THE AREA OF ROMANCE. As you take the time to go through the techniques, rituals, prayers &amp; projects, you WILL begin to magnetize the man or woman of your dreams.<br />

																<br />
															</span>Sharon shares: &quot;I bought the Soulmate Kit in April 2008 because of my desire to have a life partner. I had read many books about how we can use the power within us to create what we desire in life. But still my relationship side of things was nowhere near what I desired.<br />
															<br />
																At the age of 29, I had had my fair share of incompatible partners and I just did not want another one. During my search for what could help me, I came across the Soulmate Kit by Arielle Ford and I am forever thankful to Arielle.<br />

													<p class="middleletterbody">There are many powerful tips and meditations in the book but one of the ideas I implemented was making space for my soulmate to be. In my closet, I made space for my partner to be. I also decided to buy some flowers, bought some candles and swapped my dull bedding for nice pink bedding. Instead of having one bedside lamp, I bought another one. I bought a spare toothbrush, spare towels, spare slippers and had everything ready for my new man. Talk of active faith!<br />
													</p>
													<p class="middleletterbody">Just two months later, I met my soulmate Kelvin. We are longtime childhood friends, but had not seen each other in about 14 years. However, on the day of our reunion, we connected and immediately knew that this was meant to be. It felt natural, comfortable and most amazingly the love that we developed for each other was deep felt. Kelvin surprised me with an engagement ring on the 5th of August 2008. If you had told me in April that I would be engaged in August, I would</p>
													<p class="middleletterbody"> have told you to get lost. But thanks to the Soulmate Kit, I did. And in October 2008 we got married. To me this is a miracle, and thanks to Arielle for sharing these tips.&quot;</p>
