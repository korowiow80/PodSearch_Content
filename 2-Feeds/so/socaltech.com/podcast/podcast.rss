<item><title>Interview with Danny Kastner, FanRocket</title><description>Southern California is an interesting environment for both technology and media, and in particular for the fascinating intersections of the two industries. One of the most interesting projects in recent months that combines the two is "It's Your Show",  an online, Internet project created by NBC's Carson Daly. It's Your Show rewards users who upload their own user-generated video content with prizes, and with eventual broadcast of the winners on a television show. For today's interview, socalTECH's Ben Kuo spoke with Danny Kastner, CEO of FanRocket (www.fanrocket.com), the firm that powered the technology behind the social networking and user generated content on It's Your Show, and got his perspective on how Hollywood is now starting to think about interactivity in conjunction with its programming.</description><comments></comments><link>http://www.socaltech.com/podcast/load/14.mp3</link><author>info@socaltech.com</author><itunes:author>socalTECH</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>Interview with Danny Kastner of FanRocket, the firm that powered the user generated content and social networking technology behind Carson Daly's It's Your Show.</itunes:subtitle><itunes:summary>Southern California is an interesting environment for both technology and media, and in particular for the fascinating intersections of the two industries.
