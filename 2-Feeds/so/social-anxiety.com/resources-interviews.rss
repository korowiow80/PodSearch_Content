     <title>Free Selective Mutism Seminar with Jonathan Berent and Major League Baseball Player
</title>
     <description>Kirk Reuter was a pitcher in the major leagues for 13 years, playing for the Montreal Expos and San Francisco Giants. In the course of his career, he won 130 games and in 2002, pitched a World Series game against the Anaheim Angels. During this time, he and his wife raised two wonderful children. One suffered from Selective Mutism.
While Selective Mutism - a complex anxiety disorder characterized by verbal phobia - impacts 7 out of 1,000 children (more than autism which impacts 6 out of 1,000), there is very little productive help worldwide!
In this unique, stimulating, realistic, and frank seminar, Jonathan Berent interviews Kirk and Karla Reuters who share their successful experience in treating this severe social phobia.
Hear firsthand why Selective Mutism persists in spite of the best intentions of parents and teachers, and what’s required to break the cycle of enabling its perpetuation. Learn how to differentiate between positive and negative accommodation of Selective Mutism and what’s involved in a successful treatment process.</description>

     <title>No Surgery-No Drugs: Free Seminar on How to Conquer Blushing, Obsessing, and Performance Anxiety </title>
     <description>Blushing and facial Hyperhidrosis (a condition characterized by abnormally increased perspiration) can create toxic levels of shame, embarrassment, humiliation, and anger. This, in turn, can readily lead to public speaking anxiety, social avoidance (phobia), substance dependence, career and relationship issues, depression, and other problems. The condition and ensuing problems, believe it or not, can be resolved with the proper psych-physiological therapy. This seminar offers you the opportunity to listen to a successful 27-year-old businessman describe in detail how he conquered his problem without medication or any invasive treatment.  At one point, his situation became so critical that was in a surgeon’s office, on the verge of an operation to sever his nerves.
