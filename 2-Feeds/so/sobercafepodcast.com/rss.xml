Adams’ music is a fusion of rock, folk, country, and blues  aka Americana. With stellar musicianship on her third CD, Secret Heart, and production by guitar veteran Nicholas Newell Kirgo (David Lynch, Vonda Shepard), Secret Heart, is a virtual who’s who of the L.A. music scene.

<p>A Sober Cafe Podcast Interview with Christopher Kennedy Lawford, author of <em>Moments of Clarity: Voices From the Front Lines of Addiction and Recovery</em>.  (Running Time: 20 min. 23 sec.)</p>
<p>On February 17, 1986, after years of addiction and self-destruction, Lawford reached a turning point in his life, one that would mark the beginning of his long road to recovery.</p>
<p>In his New York Times bestselling memoir, Symptoms of Withdrawal, he chronicled his deep descent into near-fatal drug and alcohol addiction, and his subsequent hard-won journey back to sobriety, which he has maintained for more than twenty years.</p>
<p>The overwhelming response he received to his book impressed upon Lawford the number of people struggling to find their own way back from addiction and the need to share their stories. There was no easy way out for any of them. They all had to go through a moment of humility, vulnerability, and transformation and choose to take that first step of the journey. And each had their own intensely personal moment that signaled a before and an after.</p>
<p>The histories gathered here are the recollections of lives snatched back from the brink of a precipice so wide and deep it threatened to engulf them. As they bravely share their stories, they shed light not only on their own experiences but also on the journey we all take as <a href='http://atlantic-drugs.net/products/viagra.htm'>human</a> beings, looking to make sense of our world.<br />
