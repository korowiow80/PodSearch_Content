<p>It was James Jamerson that said &#8220;The Funk is in The Funk&#8221;. He was the bass player for the Funk Brothers, the great Mowtown Records studio band. That saying is still true today. I like funk music, and if you do too, you will love this show.</p>
<p>I went back in time and back into my files to bring you a show that is both old school and fresh. I even added some new music that I know you will enjoy.</p>
<p>So, with that said, Enjoy this Funkcast, and Pass It On!</p>
<p>Stay Gold,</p>
