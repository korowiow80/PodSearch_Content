			<title>Soon...A Hopeful Beginning and the End of An Anti-W Blogging Era</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://soonerthought.libsyn.com/soon-a-hopeful-beginning-and-the-end-of-an-anti-w-blogging-era]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[


<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_pV6Yk8ybhzE/SWoWmcBA_VI/AAAAAAAAAi8/aViqp-qZsQ0/s1600-h/george-bush-sour.jpg"><img border="0" style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 282px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_pV6Yk8ybhzE/SWoWmcBA_VI/AAAAAAAAAi8/aViqp-qZsQ0/s320/george-bush-sour.jpg" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5290065561911360850"/></a><br/>As the inauguration of the man of change looms, an era of blogging ends: the anti-W blogosphere will collapse.<br/><br/>Blogs started in opposition to <a href="http://goodbye.us/">W and his clearly failed policies</a>
will no longer have their raison d'être; those that hang around will
have to make do with the entropic aftermath. Perhaps they will find new
fodder for their daily posts in supporting President Obama as he
grapples with cleaning up the <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hNsGNGP4CuCYzjN7l_IeYPxOW5awD95K9TE00">Bush/NeoCon mess.</a> <br/><br/>As
W--all hat and no cattle--rides his one-trick pony into the proverbial
sunset bloggers will turn from its fading light. They'll tie one on
that good night and hope that the Obama sunrise will obliterate the
hangover and be everything we hope it to be.<br/><br/>Most likely, it won't. <br/><br/>I
think Obama's a good man. A smart man and the best possible choice for
President. He has an able, sharp, experienced Vice President and a
talented Cabinet. However, he's one good, smart man saddled with the
problems and workload of at least ten good, smart men. He'll need the
country's support. <br/><br/>He won't get it from the hardcore
Rightwing. Of course, fringe racists will also cheer his failure. One
place you will see the resilience of the Radical Right will be in the
blogsphere. Count on numerous anti-Obama sites, replete with lies,
half-truths, straw-man arguments and fallacies to populate
exponentially like cancer cells in the body politic. <br/><br/>Obama,
however, is good at fighting back. He fights logically, strategically
and effectively. He'll still need his amen corner in the blogosphere,
but that core group will be smaller than the legion of anti-W bloggers
who banded together these past eight years.<br/><br/>SoonerThought was
one of those Anti-W sites. In the midst of Bush's criminal power grab,
I felt the need to make my opposition known. Therefore, SoonerThought
started as a WordPress site in 2005. It garnered more than 200,000 hits
before I downgraded it to this inexpensive, lower-profile blogger site
a year and a half ago. The site featured original commentary and meta
news, provoking some debate and even garnering national attention--most
recently when the selection of Sarah Palin put our link on the front
page of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Alaska Daily News.</span><br/><br/>The
site's companion podcast posted more than 60 popular episodes featuring
opinions, news and interviews with politicians, comedians, musicians
and best-selling authors like <a href="http://www.killinghope.org/">William Blum </a>and <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/">Greg Palast.</a> <br/><br/>I'm
proud of SoonerThought, proud of my words and proud that in some very
small way it contributed to political change. However, as the saying
goes, all good things must come to an end--especially when a sea change
of political thought sweeps the nation.<br/><br/>Your humble editor will
still make his opinions known, still be an activist, still write checks
to good candidates and still comment in the blogosphere. But
SoonerThought has come to its natural end. Similar to my sentiments
when I left the political stage in Oklahoma as a candidate, I say four
years is plenty. I have other things to say, other stories to tell.<br/><br/>President
Obama will have my unequivocal support--it will just manifest itself in
other ways, in other places. I hope you will support him, too. Our
country needs every good man and woman to come to its aid--whether in
the blogosphere, the voting booth, or the halls of power.<br/><br/>It's
my hope that the blogosphere can become more civil, and that civility
will seep back into our politics. It starts with you--those who write
the blogs, read them and comment on them. Yes, I have been guilty of
provocative, pugilistic and even nasty commentary. When political
arguments ignite, when you see your country crashing and burning, you
obviously get passionate. If I was uncivil at times, I apologize for my
tone, though not my beliefs. I now make it my practice to be civil and
constructive in my comments on other blogs, and hope you will, too.<br/><br/>As for SoonerThought, <a href="http://dc.about.com/od/specialevents/a/Inauguration.htm">January 20 </a>puts an end to our mission. Though the nation's work is far from done, this site's work is. <br/><br/>God bless America and our planet. Thanks for reading and listening.

In a confirmed report from CNN and other news services, 72-year-old Sen. John McCain has picked the scandal-tinged, 44-year-old Alaska
Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate on the GOP ticket for the White
House. McSame has thrown the long ball, hoping for a touchdown by

Ted Stevens' alleged criminal misconduct, and is polling more &quot;purple&quot; than red these days. It's also not that big in electoral votes: only three--the same as Joe Biden's Delaware.2.

taken a page from the George H.W. Bush playbook for this one. Gov. Palin, the new Dan Quayle. The stellar, record breaking Democratic National Convention
must have scared the crap out of the former maverick, making him into a
desperate old man who has just made one terribly dumb decision.6. If McCain were to, God forbid, succumb to old age or cancer, does anyone really think Palin could be an effective president? Joe Biden could easily take the reins if a tragic or unforeseen development arose that made it a necessity. Palin has admitted she doesn't even know what the &quot;vice president does every day.&quot; Imagine her as president. Sadly, Sarah Palin would be a worldwide laughingstock and a disaster for our nation.Bottom Line: Nice try, Senator. Enjoy your retirement.]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Biden takes a hit by funding vehicle that saved Iowans</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://soonerthought.libsyn.com/biden-takes-a-hit-by-funding-vehicle-that-saved-iowans]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<a href="http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071021/OPINION01/710210337/-1">From the Des Moines Register</a><br/><p><br/>You
probably didn't hear or read about four soldiers from an Ottumwa-based
Iowa National Guard unit being wounded in Iraq a few days ago.<br/><br/>It
rated only four paragraphs in the paper, which is probably
understandable given there were not many details available - including
the soldiers' names.<br/><br/>The Iowans were wounded when an improvised
explosive device - a roadside bomb - exploded next to their vehicle
during a patrol near the Iraqi city of Samarra. Two of the soldiers
were injured seriously enough to be flown to a military hospital at
Landstuhl, Germany. The two other members of the 833rd Engineer Company
were treated in Iraq and returned to duty.<br/><br/>Here's what initial news reports didn't say:<br/><br/>&quot;They
were in an RG-31 armored vehicle,&quot; said Lt. Col. Gregory Hapgood, chief
spokesman for the Iowa National Guard. &quot;If they'd been in a Humvee,
they would have been killed. A Humvee couldn't have withstood the
explosion.&quot;<br/><br/>You could call it &quot;Exhibit A&quot; in the argument over
whether to build more of the state-of-the-art armored vehicles for use
by U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not that you would think such a
thing would be a point of political controversy. But it is, and you can
ask Joe Biden if you don't believe it.<br/><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br/>More
than any other member of Congress, the Delaware senator has pushed for
funding and construction of thousands of Mine Resistant Ambush
Protected (MRAP) vehicles - including the RG-31 - the type that saved
the Iowa soldiers last week.<br/></span><br/>Why would championing these things cost a politician, when they are certain to protect American troops?<br/><br/>Well, <a href="http://www.joebiden.com/">Biden </a>is
a Democrat running for president. Democrats, particularly party
activists who will attend the caucuses, are loathe to back anybody they
even suspect might support the war in Iraq.<br/><br/>Biden opposes the
war, and it's not just jabbering. He's come up with a plan to divide
Iraq into three semi-independent regions with a strong central
government and a fair split of oil revenues. It may be the best idea
yet to resolve the ugly situation and get U.S. troops home.<br/><br/>Biden's
political problem: He cast a Senate vote in May in favor of a
supplementary appropriations bill to continue funding the war. The sole
reason is because the bill included funding for buying MRAP vehicles.<br/><br/>There
was, as they say, hell to pay. Especially because Democrat presidential
candidates Sens. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Christopher Dodd all
voted against the bill. Those candidates support appropriations for the
MRAP, just not when it is specifically tied to an Iraq war funding
bill. Their spinning translation? Biden voted for the funding,
therefore he supports the war.<br/><br/>Biden says the vote made him &quot;the
bastard at the family picnic.&quot; Anti-war activists held &quot;Impeach Biden&quot;
signs when he visited Iowa City. His staffers warned he would &quot;get his
skin ripped off&quot; if he attended an event in Council Bluffs.<br/><br/>All because of the vote. And he says he doesn't care.<br/><br/>&quot;As
long as there's one American kid over there, I'm voting the money for
these things,&quot; Biden said in a chat the other day during a stop in Des
Moines. &quot;It's the one way we can save lives before getting them out.&quot;<br/><br/>He
got an education a couple of years ago, during his fifth trip to Iraq,
when he saw one of the relatively few MRAP vehicles in the country.
Then he talked to some soldiers about an MRAP that had been hit by a
roadside bomb. It was a large vehicle known as a Cougar and it had
taken a direct hit. Soldiers explained to Biden it had been thrown 25
feet straight up and sustained massive damage. The soldiers inside were
shaken, but all walked away.<br/><br/>Like the situation with the Iowa soldiers, the vehicle saved their lives.<br/><br/>The
MRAP vehicles are built with a V-shaped undercarriage that deflects
shrapnel from mines and roadside bombs from the passenger compartment.<br/><br/>The
military estimates that MRAP vehicles would prevent from between 68
percent and 80 percent of deaths and injuries from the roadside bombs,
as compared to armored Humvees.<br/><br/>&quot;Seventy percent of all the kids
killed or wounded are from IEDs,&quot; Biden said. &quot;If you can extend life
expectancy by 80 percent by having MRAPs, how can you not fund it?&quot;<br/><br/>Then he pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, checked the numbers, and gave a startling bit of information.<br/><br/>&quot;From
March of 2003 to July 19, 2007, if we'd had MRAP vehicles in Iraq it's
reasonable to say that between 938 and 1,120 Americans who were killed
by IEDs would still be alive.&quot;<br/><br/>Manufacture of the new vehicles
is under way, largely because Biden became such a pain in the neck to

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[From the Des Moines RegisterYou
probably didn't hear or read about four soldiers from an Ottumwa-based
Iowa National Guard unit being wounded in Iraq a few days ago.It
rated only four paragraphs in the paper, which is probably
understandable given there were not many details available - including
the soldiers' names.The Iowans were wounded when an improvised
explosive device - a roadside bomb - exploded next to their vehicle
during a patrol near the Iraqi city of Samarra. Two of the soldiers
were injured seriously enough to be flown to a military hospital at
Landstuhl, Germany. The two other members of the 833rd Engineer Company
were treated in Iraq and returned to duty.Here's what initial news reports didn't say:&quot;They
were in an RG-31 armored vehicle,&quot; said Lt. Col. Gregory Hapgood, chief
spokesman for the Iowa National Guard. &quot;If they'd been in a Humvee,
they would have been killed. A Humvee couldn't have withstood the
explosion.&quot;You could call it &quot;Exhibit A&quot; in the argument over
whether to build more of the state-of-the-art armored vehicles for use
by U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Not that you would think such a
thing would be a point of political controversy. But it is, and you can
ask Joe Biden if you don't believe it.More
than any other member of Congress, the Delaware senator has pushed for
funding and construction of thousands of Mine Resistant Ambush
Protected (MRAP) vehicles - including the RG-31 - the type that saved
the Iowa soldiers last week.Why would championing these things cost a politician, when they are certain to protect American troops?Well, Biden is
a Democrat running for president. Democrats, particularly party
activists who will attend the caucuses, are loathe to back anybody they
even suspect might support the war in Iraq.Biden opposes the
war, and it's not just jabbering. He's come up with a plan to divide
Iraq into three semi-independent regions with a strong central
government and a fair split of oil revenues. It may be the best idea
yet to resolve the ugly situation and get U.S. troops home.Biden's
political problem: He cast a Senate vote in May in favor of a
supplementary appropriations bill to continue funding the war. The sole
reason is because the bill included funding for buying MRAP vehicles.There
was, as they say, hell to pay. Especially because Democrat presidential
candidates Sens. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and Christopher Dodd all
voted against the bill. Those candidates support appropriations for the
MRAP, just not when it is specifically tied to an Iraq war funding
bill. Their spinning translation? Biden voted for the funding,
therefore he supports the war.Biden says the vote made him &quot;the
bastard at the family picnic.&quot; Anti-war activists held &quot;Impeach Biden&quot;
signs when he visited Iowa City. His staffers warned he would &quot;get his
skin ripped off&quot; if he attended an event in Council Bluffs.All because of the vote. And he says he doesn't care.&quot;As
long as there's one American kid over there, I'm voting the money for
these things,&quot; Biden said in a chat the other day during a stop in Des
Moines. &quot;It's the one way we can save lives before getting them out.&quot;He
got an education a couple of years ago, during his fifth trip to Iraq,
when he saw one of the relatively few MRAP vehicles in the country.
Then he talked to some soldiers about an MRAP that had been hit by a
roadside bomb. It was a large vehicle known as a Cougar and it had
taken a direct hit. Soldiers explained to Biden it had been thrown 25
feet straight up and sustained massive damage. The soldiers inside were
shaken, but all walked away.Like the situation with the Iowa soldiers, the vehicle saved their lives.The
MRAP vehicles are built with a V-shaped undercarriage that deflects
shrapnel from mines and roadside bombs from the passenger compartment.The
military estimates that MRAP vehicles would prevent from between 68
percent and 80 percent of deaths and injuries from the roadside bombs,
as compared to armored Humvees.&quot;Seventy percent of all the kids
killed or wounded are from IEDs,&quot; Biden said. &quot;If you can extend life
expectancy by 80 percent by having MRAPs, how can you not fund it?&quot;Then he pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, checked the numbers, and gave a startling bit of information.&quot;From
March of 2003 to July 19, 2007, if we'd had MRAP vehicles in Iraq it's
reasonable to say that between 938 and 1,120 Americans who were killed
by IEDs would still be alive.&quot;Manufacture of the new vehicles
is under way, largely because Biden became such a pain in the neck to
his congressional colleagues on the issue. So far, $23.6 billion has
been appropriated for building and deploying 18,000 MRAPs in Iraq.
Ideally, they would replace all of the Army's up-armored Humvees in the
country.Biden promises to keep up the fight to see that funding continues.&quot;It's cost me politically,&quot; Biden said. &quot;But some things are worth losing elections over. This is one.&quot;You can bet the four Iowa National Guard soldiers who were wounded last week and their families would agree.Columnist John Carlson can be reached at (515) 284-8204 or jcarlson@dmreg.com

			<title>Cheney Out of Control?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://soonerthought.libsyn.com/cheney-out-of-control-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/chapters/pushing_the_envelope_on_presi/index.html">excerpt:</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Shortly after the first accused terrorists reached the U.S. naval
prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on Jan. 11, 2002, a delegation from CIA
headquarters arrived in the Situation Room. The agency presented a
delicate problem to White House counsel <a class="ckCharacterLink" title="Alberto Gonzales" href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/about/cast_of_characters/#gonzales">Alberto R. Gonzales</a>,
a man with next to no experience on the subject. Vice President
Cheney's lawyer, who had a great deal of experience, sat nearby.</p>


<p>The meeting marked &quot;the first time that the issue of interrogations comes up&quot; among top-ranking White House officials, recalled <a class="ckCharacterLink" title="John Yoo" href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/cheney/about/cast_of_characters/#yoo">John C. Yoo</a>,
who represented the Justice Department. &quot;The CIA guys said, 'We're
going to have some real difficulties getting actionable intelligence
from detainees'&quot; if interrogators confined themselves to treatment
allowed by the Geneva Conventions.</p>

 
<p>From that moment, well before previous accounts have suggested,
Cheney turned his attention to the practical business of crushing a
captive's will to resist. The vice president's office played a central
role in shattering limits on coercion of prisoners in U.S. custody,
commissioning and defending legal opinions that the Bush administration
has since portrayed as the initiatives, months later, of lower-ranking
officials.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://soonerthought.libsyn.com/episode-47-greg-palast-returns-5-4-07]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode welcomes back our friend <i>New
York Times</i> bestselling author and master muckraker Greg Palast, author of â��<a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/madhouse/index.php/order-the-book/">Armed
Madhouse</a>â�� (Penguin Paperback 2007). When Palast, an investigator of
corporate fraud and racketeering, turned his skills to journalism, he was
quickly recognized as, â��The most important investigative reporter of our timeâ��
[Tribune Magazine] in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Britain</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
where his first reports appeared on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/default.stm">BBC
television</a> and in the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/">Guardian</a>
newspapers.

<p>Author of another <i>New York Times</i>
bestseller, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452285674/sr=8-1/qid=1141325432/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-1828809-7219148?%5Fencoding=UTF8">The
Best Democracy Money Can Buy</a>, Palast is best known in his native USA as the
journalist who, for the <a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/">Observer</a>
(UK), broke the story of how Jeb Bush purged thousands of Black Florida
citizens from voter rolls before the 2000 election, thereby handing the White
House to his brother George. His reports on the theft of election 2004, the
spike of the FBI investigations of the bin Ladens before September 11, the
secret State Department documents planning the seizure of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>â��s oil
fields have won him a record six â��Project Censoredâ�� for reporting the news
American media doesnâ��t want you to hear. â��The top investigative journalist in
the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is persona non grata in his own countryâ��s media.â�� [<st1:place w:st="on"><i>Asia</i></st1:place><i> Times</i>.] He returned to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region> to report for <a href="http://harpers.org/">Harperâ��s Magazine</a>.</p>



<p>Palastâ��s Sam Spade style television and print exposÃ©â��s about elections manipulations,
War on Terror and globalization, as seen on BBC â��s Newsnight and Amy Goodmanâ��s <a href="http://democracynow.org/">Democracy Now!</a> His writings have won the
Financial Times David Thomas Prizeâ��and inspired the Eminem video, Mosh. â��An
American hero,â�� said Martin Luther King III. In the BBC documentary, <i>Bush Family Fortunes</i>, Palast exposed
George Bush Jr.â��s dodging the Vietnam War draft. Greg Palast, says Noam
Chomsky, â��Upsets all the right people.â��</p>



<p>Palast won the George Orwell Courage in Journalism Award for his BBC
documentary, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T7YWQ/qid=1141328979/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-1828809-7219148?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=130">Bush

<p><font size="3">Please&nbsp;understand: I respect the need for security on airliners. We must try to screen bad guys from doing bad things on our planes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">But I have to ask: <em>where do we draw the line for reasonable security?</em></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Nineteen murderous bastards allegedly used box cutters to take over the planes of 9/11. So now we cannot bring fingernail clippers on planes. <em>Okay.</em></font></p>
<p><font size="3">One idiot tries to set off </font><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1731568.stm"><font size="3">shoe bombs</font></a><font size="3">, so now we have to have remove our shoes to be checked. Lucky it wasn't an underwear bomb, I guess.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Now, its liquids you will not be allowed to bring any liquids of any kind (except medicines and baby formula) onto the plane and this will be a permanent rule (see below). What really pisses me off are rumors that they also want to </font><a href="http://blogs.smh.com.au/lostintransit/archives/2006/08/crucial_times_f.html"><font size="3">ban my iPod.</font></a><font size="3"> This is just ridiculous,&nbsp;stupid overkill.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Precautions are understandable, but really, where does it stop? I am fully willing to sign a form that says I understand flying is risky and that&nbsp;I will take my chances with<em> <a href="http://www.stupidsecurity.com/">reasonable</a></em></font><a href="http://www.stupidsecurity.com/"><font size="3"> security precautions</font></a><font size="3">. How about you?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="3">What I am not willing to do is sacrifice my dignity for ridiculous personal searches which&nbsp;add hours to the airport check-in. I am just not willing to&nbsp;get on this slippery slope to eventually losing all personal liberties right down to having a cup of Starbucks on the </font><a href="http://www.thedonovan.com/beth/archives/004649.html"><font size="3">overcrowded, smelly, poorly-operated planes</font></a><font size="3"> I must ride.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I know, I know, If I don't like it I can just drive; and&nbsp;I <em>do</em> drive now, whenever possible. But you and I know that airliners are simply indispensable for most business and vacation travel.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Therefore, I offer this:<em><b> Life is risky. Suck it up.</b></em></font></p>
<p><font size="3">Americans are smarter and tougher than our government seems to understand. Talk to us like adults. Tell us the risks, then let us decide. But this nanny-national security state stuff is just </font><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-seery/busted-bamboozlability-_b_26978.html"><font size="3">crushing the American way</font></a><font size="3">. Besides that, BushCo cynically and without apology </font><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/AR2006012601478.html"><font size="3">uses fear of terrorism as political ammo </font></a><font size="3">against their opponents. Just ask <state></state><place></place>Connecticut voters for Ned Lamont. No less an eminence than our </font><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/11/AR2006081100919.html"><font size="3">crooked Vice President has said that by voting for Lamont over Lieberman, we have aided and comforted the enemy.</font></a></p>
<p><font size="3">We should </font><a href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/home/"><font size="3">demand our government stop</font></a><font size="3"> imposing hysteria-induced security measures on us. As trite as it sounds, with every liberty lost, with every silly precaution&nbsp;imposed that changes our way of life,&nbsp;the bad guys win.</font></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="entry"><p><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><em>A Rant</em></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">You know what really pisses me off? That these flag waving, America-first, Jesus is my co-pilot NeoCons who have their noses so far up Bush's ass they <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/television/novak_says_plamewilson_suit_will_be_dismissed_40185.asp"><font color="#b85b5a">won't admit that Valerie Plame has a legitimate case</font></a> against the Administration. She was a covert agent who was outed because her husband, a decorated Republican-appointed ambassador, had the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/truth/interviews/"><font color="#b85b5a">temerity to tell the truth.</font></a></font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">It seems NeoCons can get behind and even lionize as heroes convicted criminals like G. Gordon Liddy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reagan_administration_scandals"><font color="#b85b5a">Ollie North, Elliot Abrams</font></a> and numerous others with no apparent irony or sense of hypocrisy; but when a person who is a legitimate hero happens to disagree with their Dear Leader, they <a href="http://factcheck.org/article231.html"><font color="#b85b5a">Swift Boat</font></a> them. &nbsp;</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">They are also the first to say that dissent is hazardous to our troops; unless our <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehren_Watada"><font color="#b85b5a">troops oppose the president</font></a> or when our spies tell the truth.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">&nbsp;</font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Note to NeoCons: If you love this country (a sentiment&nbsp;you practically salivate over on Fox News), you have to play by the rules.&nbsp; You do not take up arms against a brother. You do not expose a CIA agent in the name of political gotcha. You do not <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200508180005"><font color="#b85b5a">attack the mother of one our fallen soldiers</font></a> because you don't like her politics. Americans should not be doing this to each other, even under the reign of the divider/decider in Chief.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">I am also incensed by people who virtually worship NYC over 9/11 (which is fine), but laugh off disaster victims in New Orleans as <a href="http://www.repentamerica.com/pr_hurricanekatrina.html"><font color="#b85b5a">godless</font></a> or fools (<a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/wise10292005.html"><font color="#b85b5a">how stupid of them to live in a city that is below sea level! They deserved to drown!).</font></a>&nbsp;This is an historic American city, a crucial seaport and the home of American citizens. Stop laughing about the disaster, you assholes. If other Americans had done this kind of bullshit to Oklahoma City when the American terrorist McVeigh attacked us, I can assure you I and several of my fellow Okies would have tracked&nbsp;them down to kick&nbsp;their asses.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Down is up, up is down with NeoCons. Thank God <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/37947/"><font color="#b85b5a">America is waking up</font></a> to just how corrupt the entire movement is. To the 33 percent or so of Americans who are too A. Stubborn B. Dumb C. Mean to admit the truth, I say: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5167420.stm"><font color="#b85b5a">There's always Mexico.</font></a>&nbsp;Go south...you can still <a href="http://www.gregpalast.com/columns.cfm?subject_id=1&subject_name=Theft%20of%20Presidency"><font color="#b85b5a">steal an election</font></a> down there, ya bastards.</font></font></font></font></font></p>
