			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you stopped moving because you’re frozen in fear? Do you feel like you hit a brick wall where sales are concerned and don&#8217;t know what to do next?</p>
<p>This happens to many of us, particularly when we are walking down a new path or starting on a journey that leads us into unfamiliar territory. You are moving along, often at a fairly swift pace, and you suddenly stop frozen in your tracks. It&#8217;s as if there is a wall in front of you blocking your way. Upon closer examination you see a door. You slowly reach your hand out and turn the knob, timidly, because you aren’t sure what’s on the other side of the door.</p>
<p><strong>The locked door represents an obstacle on the road to achieving your goals.</strong></p>
<p>You may be stopped, standing in front of your own closed door right now. The thing is you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind that door. It could be opportunity. More money. More clients. You won’t know until you get it open.</p>
<p>But the door is locked you whine… (I don’t have samples, no one is hiring, I don&#8217;t have time, I don&#8217;t know where to find leads&#8230;) So what? Break it fricken’ down and see what&#8217;s there!</p>
<p><strong><em>Listen to this week’s podcast and discover what locked doors are stopping you from making the money you desire as a freelance copywriter.</em></strong></p>
<p>Take your freelance copywriting career to the next level, or find out if it is for you by completing our <a title="http://www.thecopywritinginstitute.com/downloads/DiscoveryPackage.docx" href="http://www.thecopywritinginstitute.com/downloads/DiscoveryPackage.docx" target="_blank">Copywriter Discovery Package and scheduling a complementary review with Kelly Robbins,MA, here</a>.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Have you stopped moving because you’re frozen in fear? Do you feel like you hit a brick wall where sales are concerned and don&#8217;t know what to do next?
This happens to many of us, particularly when we are walking down a new path or starting on a journey that leads us into unfamiliar territory. You are moving along, often at a fairly swift pace, and you suddenly stop frozen in your tracks. It&#8217;s as if there is a wall in front of you blocking your way. Upon closer examination you see a door. You slowly reach your hand out and turn the knob, timidly, because you aren’t sure what’s on the other side of the door.
The locked door represents an obstacle on the road to achieving your goals.
You may be stopped, standing in front of your own closed door right now. The thing is you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s behind that door. It could be opportunity. More money. More clients. You won’t know until you get it open.
But the door is locked you whine… (I don’t have samples, no one is hiring, I don&#8217;t have time, I don&#8217;t know where to find leads&#8230;) So what? Break it fricken’ down and see what&#8217;s there!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is all the buzz in marketing your freelance copywriting business today. In the last two weeks I have read at least 12 articles on pinterest (a Facebook or Twitter application) alone. Before that Google+ was a must-have for anybody who wanted to be anybody. It’s as easy to see how marketers can feel obligated to participate in social media as it is to quickly become overwhelmed with the variety of choices and maintenance required to achieve results. The enormity of creating a simple presence on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn in addition to creating and maintaining a website, blog, e-zine and all the other mediums available today is daunting.</p>
<p>With all the social media hoopla anyone could easily jump on the bandwagon and add one (or several) more things to their to-do list in the rush to keep up with the newest trends. Today’s advice is look before you leap. You don’t have to be everywhere to make money!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why does one aspiring copywriter quickly succeed and another struggle? Why do some painfully sweat to set their business up and attract clients while others seem to magically get business without putting much effort into it? Which are you – a struggler or an attractor?</p>
<p>I bet you know immediately which category you fall into, but understanding WHY you are in a specific category and then taking action to change direction is a completely different thing. It’s often hard to take an objective look at yourself and see what you are (or are not) doing that is prohibiting or stalling your success. This difficulty is often why we hire coaches, therapists or other professionals to help us create change. Outsiders can see things we can’t offer objective advice and tend to help us make strategic changes faster than we would on our own.</p>

<p>I have spent the last 2 weeks speaking with dozens of copywriters interested in taking control of their lives and proactively growing their business. While these copywriters may be great writers, what they aren’t doing is making money and attracting new clients.

<p>Listen to today&#8217;s podcast and learn what the copywriters that are struggling are doing and what the ones making money are doing. It&#8217;s NOT what everyone is telling you to do!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been having trouble reaching your goals and creating the  business and life you desire, odds are you will find several  self-sabotaging behaviors ruining your success. Self-sabotage, by  definition, is thoughts, feelings and actions that block your success by  working against your own self-interests. Only a crazy person would  consciously sabotage their own success, right? The thing is you are  probably not sabotaging yourself consciously. All of this is happening  underneath your radar in your subconscious. This is the first thing we  need to work through, recognizing those self-sabotaging behaviors.</p>
