			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So Disease Illusion hail from Italy and play a sort of Dark Tranquility/<a href="http://www.soundcult.com/metal/in-flames-come-clarity/" target="_blank">In Flames</a> melodeath, not a bad thing per say, but a pretty popular and filled genre, seems this is a re-invention of sorts, since the band was previously called &#8220;The Reapers&#8221; playing some Thrash Metal and now they are playing Melodic Death, interesting.<br />
<span id="more-1682"></span><br />
So Backworld starts up with &#8220;Last Murder&#8221;, you kinda get the feel for Disease Illusion&#8217;s sound barrage, its a pretty harsh old school Melodic Death Metal, not too shabby, with some metalcore/thrash flairs in between, but that&#8217;s not a bad thing, &#8220;Last Murder&#8221; is what you would expect from more old school melodeath, the melodic part comes from melodic guitar work and cleaner vocals, but not the &#8220;voice changes into a sissy girl&#8221; kind of melodeath, next up is &#8220;Eyes of Medusa&#8221; another solid track with break downs and nice melodic guitar work, &#8220;Predator&#8221; is a nice track that sounds a bit like the last track with a not so catchy chorus.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Ashes to Dust&#8221; is another solid track, still i see a pattern here, the songs are good but a bit too similar, &#8220;Denied&#8221; starts pretty nicely, but like everything here, it kinda then goes into the death part, don&#8217;t get me wrong, its not shit, its just good enough, &#8220;One Last Breath&#8221; is a bit of a fresher take, with more paced guitar tempos and some piano work, i liked it! probably my fav of the album, &#8220;The Truth&#8221; is also a bit different, drifting a bit into almost black metal territory, its a pretty nice track.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything into Nothing&#8221; is a back to form from the first part of the album, solid unremarkable track, &#8220;Redemption of the Dreamer&#8221; is sort of like most of the album, nice one listen, good guitar work, a bit of a muddled sound, then the album finishes up with &#8220;Light on this Earth&#8221; again a nice but nothing to call home about track.</p>
<p>Humm so what do i think of Disease Illusion&#8217;s Backworld, its pretty good and i like it, still production wise it sounds a bit muddled, and then the genre and their particular style makes the album a bit of a one trick pony, a nice pony but still with just one trick, Melodic Death works a lot around catchy hooks and here they are few and far between, and tracks tend to meld down and have little to no difference, even with the above standard melodic riff work, i would say if you are into Melodic Death Metal, then give it a go! If not&#8230; the Pass ^_^&#8217;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Its like beating a dead horse, there is such as thing as quitting while you are ahead, Fear Factory is one of my all time favorite bands and as such im kinda a bit biased towards then, but ever since &#8220;Digimortal&#8221; (a in my opinion half-hassed album), Fear Factory is pretty much dead to me, still they keep churning these things away, and so now we are presented with &#8220;The Industrialist&#8221;!<br />
<span id="more-1655"></span><br />
Baked piece of shit! Im not a revivalist that likes only old school stuff and for bands to keep sending the same thing over and over again, i kinda always hope they change with time, that they improve on their sound and send fresh new things to my brain, of course that does not guarantee WIN! but at least it keeps it fresh or at least shows some effort, alas not with Fear Factory, from Digimortal forward, all album covers are rehashed (all with versions of that FF V bullshit), all the song names were pulled from the fucking thesarus and the songs&#8230; don&#8217;t start me on that!</p>
<p>So here we have The Industrialist, and first track is&#8230; &#8220;The Industrialist&#8221;, starting up with a nice vintage &#8220;the world is in the shitter&#8221; <a href="http://www.soundcult.com/metal/ministry-rio-grande-blood/" target="_blank">Ministry</a> kind of thing, and that rolls into the most basic Fear Factory blast beat groove of all time, there is no connection between singing and music, Burton is there singing in the corner, while everyone else is blasting away somewhere else, hell the only good thing is that Burton avoided the distorted voice chorus only until the end, even Dino Cazares trademark simplistic playing is even more plain than ever&#8230;</p>
<p>Next up is &#8220;Recharger&#8221;, ohhh bland industrial that gets a distorted random chorus, at least in Digimortal they were kinda catchy, its cliche, boring and i&#8217;ve heard Fear Factory play this a thousand time, &#8220;New Messhiah&#8221; (god these track names make me laugh) again barely the same drumming patterns and the new emo-pop chorus just puts a cute bow on top of it, &#8220;God Eater&#8221; *giggle* ohhh &#8220;John Carpenter&#8217;s Evil Musical Twin&#8221;&#8230; no, not really, that was me being a bit hopeful, this repetitive bullshit is pissing me off!</p>
<p>&#8220;Depraved Mind Murder&#8221; give me a break, using a drill sound for added &#8220;heaviness&#8221;, its silly and the track is a dissociative mess of a sound, &#8220;Virus of Faith&#8221; i think i heard this one before, oh right it was the first track&#8230; and the chorus, makes me want to cry, its so shitty! &#8220;Difference Engine&#8221; HERE IT COMES! another generic rehash of a thousand Fear Factory tracks! (with recycled sound samples and everything), &#8220;Disassemble&#8221; is another (I&#8217;ve heard before) track, its un-original at best, &#8220;Religion is Flawed Because Man Is&#8221; is the bullshit excuse to put something more melodic in every Fear Factory album, &#8220;Human Augmentation&#8221; is more random soundbites, cause they probably needed some time filler and its hard to create all those original tracks.</p>
<p>Its incredible to me how Fear Factory were able to bland-n-nize their music so much, its barely industrial, barely death metal, its soo rehashed, i&#8217;ve heard these drum patters, these singing, these audio samples, all before&#8230; at least on Digimortal Fear Factory decided to try something new, a more basic approachable sound, and then they decided to stick to that sound until the end of times, every Fear Factory record from there on, and there are plenty! &#8220;Archetype&#8221; (in 2004), then &#8220;<a href="http://www.soundcult.com/metal/fear-factory-transgression/" target="_blank">Transgression</a>&#8221; (in 2005), then &#8220;Mechanize&#8221; (in 2009) and now this piece of shit &#8220;The Industrialist&#8221;, oh joy of joys, every single song from &#8220;Digimortal&#8221; to &#8220;The Industrialist&#8221; is a bland baked rehash of the precious song, its one formula, its one way of playing and one sound, its double bass white noise, skip this album, hell skip everything from here on out&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Born in the Pits of Portugal (although Hell could have been a good guess) in 2001 by the hands of Baal Sabbath (guitars, bass) and Devasth (vocals, programming), the intention was understandably to unleash the fiercest, most violent and destructive Black Metal manifestation ever.<br />
<span id="more-1595"></span><br />
Quite soon, the band started releasing Underground demos and the consequences were decently positive – a certain attention with higher printing numbers appeared, and reactions have been solidly supportive ever since, and for all the true reasons. I do not for a second doubt the good reasons that made Ketzer sign this Portuguese piece of Black Metal hatred. As NARGAROTH would have it, Black Metal ist Krieg, but it can also be written and performed with quality riffing and structure without losing any of the feeling. </p>
<p>LUX FERRE should by all means be hailed for the competent alliance of talent with feeling, not yielding to trends, but also not sticking around the pool of musical creative incompetence that seems to dominate the «raw» scene. But there are exceptions, few and far between.</p>
<p>The cold vocals, music that rebounds grimness, early MARDUK, Norwegian influences every now and then – the formula is complete. LUX FERRE absorb all the good influences and never sound dependent – and they do it with copious amounts of quality, of feeling, without ever becoming untrue. The sound is also quite okay – cold and distant on the one hand and, on the other, perfectly perceptible. Antichristian War Propaganda features a real drummer (who also happens to be Brazilian and is Lord Mantus, of MYSTERIIS, DARKEST HATE WARFRONT and ANCIENT BLOOD fame). The mastering was taken care of at the Necromorbus Studios (Sweden) and the German Ketzer Records released it. I like the international flair of the album.</p>
<p>Lux Ferre is the Latin origin of Luci fer, the Bearer of Light – a Light that, according to the band’s ideology is best disseminated through True War Satanic Black Metal, both musically and lyrically. The concept of the band clearly sets firm ground on Man’s primary feature: an instinctive impulse for self-destruction through War. Ideologies aside, this is highly explosive – grim and recommended stuff. One of the few BM bands that have of late succeeded in drawing my attention to the genre.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humm so Anachronaeon, unfortunately never heard of them, it happens! Still its a Swedish duo formed by Patrik Carlsson and Andreas Åkerlind, from the first couple of listens this album a blackish melodic death metal it has a bit a feel of a concept album with tracks flowing pretty well between themselves, also i liked the the cover art, you can check yourself on top, it does look pretty good! That or maybe lately I&#8217;ve been way too much around black metal hehehe, anyways here is &#8220;The Ethereal Throne&#8221;.<br />
<span id="more-1560"></span><br />
The album starts off with &#8220;Mary&#8221; a slow building melodic start, not too sure what i feel about it, sounds a bit&#8230; cheesy, then it goes into melodeath, even with my apprehension its a pretty solid track, &#8220;Essence Of My Becoming&#8221; starts up with a dread guitar work, its actually a very eerie doom track, i like it&#8230; a lot! it combines slow paced interludes with blastbeat death, its uncommon and pretty fresh, lots of variation, followed by &#8220;To Ashes&#8221; were we are back to more melodic death, with some nice quick burst guitar solos.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Whereabouts&#8221; starts a bit like Mary slow moving backdrop talking into melodic death blasting, its a bit&#8230; humm ok, i don&#8217;t get how it fits, but the melodeath sounds pretty good, &#8220;Defying My Master&#8221; starts again with the backdrop talking into melodic metal hummm with some pretty catchy riffs, probably my fav until now, &#8220;Seeds Of Darkness Sprouting In Light&#8221; brings back a bit of doom and melodic death, with some blasting guiding it along its way, &#8220;The Inevitable Day&#8221; is a softer track, more melodic easing up on the doom, kinda feels like its the point where they sound best, in between full force blasting and eery doomish rock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shattering The Earthly Bond&#8221; uhh sounds ominous and it actually plays ominous, blasting death all the way, good good hehehe, although by the end it gets a bit weirdly, anyhoo finishing it up with &#8220;A White Dove Flew Over The Prison Walls&#8221;, mostly a melodic track, its fitting, although it does end up in a melodic death solo into a repetitive ending, one thing i gotta say Anachronaeon do know their chops, and so it ends!</p>
<p>I must say, good job Anachronaeon, your name is hard to pronounce, but the music is solid as fuck, and a pretty good listen to boot, production is sharp, the music was well played and pretty crisp, also the vocals were good, although a bit monotone, i think it actually fits the music pretty well, guess Anachronaeon gets the seal of approval, if you are into sort of doomish melodic death concept albums, than this one is a keeper, go get it!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So &#8220;The Hardest Season&#8221;, i do wonder&#8230; what is (the hardest season)&#8230; anyhoo these boys hail from Italy, they are composed of Luca (vocals), Fabrizio (guitar), Valerio (bass), Riccardo (guitar), Roberto (drums) and from the first couple of listens (actually from the start) this is hardcore with flair, not too sure if its my fav style, but surely well played and very tight and focused, so lets get our hands on &#8220;Dawn&#8221; (humm&#8230; dawns, seasons&#8230; very&#8230; hehehe).<br />
<span id="more-1550"></span><br />
Ok from the get-go with &#8220;Confessions&#8221; you get the all too familiar hardcore blast/screamo, this permeates all through the album, be sure this is hardcore! Not that its a bad thing, just that &#8220;The Hardest Season&#8221; twisting and spasms don&#8217;t fall too far from the hardcore tree&#8230; sorry hehehe back to &#8220;Confessions&#8221; humm starting off with screaming blastbeating into a more mellow screaming, next up is &#8220;Dead Romantic&#8221; blasting away again, still like the track before tweaking here and there, eventually slowing it down to a sort of half breakbeat, pretty good! &#8220;Nightmare of You&#8221; sets pretty much the scheme, hardcore blasting into, slower dreadier passages&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleepless&#8221; you are up, and we get a more &#8220;new wave&#8221; hardcore, its good! but always with some breaks and kinks here and there, this is good stuff, &#8220;Tears Valley Sickness Blues&#8221; is a quicky hardcore blaster, then the melodic interlude with &#8220;The Foreword&#8221;, hummm not too sure about this one it does wind up into a a nice crescendo, just these melodic parts with backdrop vocals sound weird, the apply named &#8220;The Storm&#8221; is a bit a &#8220;stormy&#8221; hardcore track, &#8220;Desolation in Gb Minor&#8221; is a slowed down hardcore track, almost sludge, still pretty good contrast, and because of the slowed pace the vocals sound awesomely sharp, nice one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twentyeight to Ten&#8221; is back to blasting hardcore, building and yelling away to a chorus crescendo, kinda weird, but hardcorish for sure! &#8220;Last Fuckin&#8217; Scarred Lines&#8221; is more hard/hardcore and what a fitting way to finish a album&#8230; blasting away&#8230;</p>
<p>One thing I cant beat &#8220;The Hardest Season&#8221; is for being too formulaic, something hard to escape in the narrow landscapes of hardcore, i also like the position of the tracks, i normally have a issue with that, not in this album, especially cause some hardcore tracks if listen in succession might sound very similar, production is spot on, i really wasn&#8217;t expecting much from this album, but i can say i left this one pretty happy, if you are craving for some hardcore, give this one a try!</p>

Very much based upon the Satanist thought commando, the first demo Hell on Earth came out in 2000, featuring Vulgaris on drums. Several line-up changes afterwards, 2001 saw the release of Perdition, the demo that signed the band to Ordealis Records, through which they released yet this In Signo Suo.<br />
<span id="more-1546"></span><br />
Hmmm…. I cannot say whether it is a planned label policy, but many Ordealis bands choose album titles in Latin (check GHOLGOTH’s Somnus Mortis Imago or MÜTIILATION’s Majestas Leprosus).</p>
<p>What PERDITOR have to offer is probably more than just a musical release. The small amount of information I have gathered in the process points at a modern day VENOM way of life and music. Musically speaking, PERDITOR stroll down the alleys of early harsh BM with a number of Thrash influences (a very significant number of Thrash influences, in fact). </p>
<p>The next obvious step is considering this Dutch gathering as an old school act. Vocally, Cronos seems to have a semi-follower in Azazel, only the latter does have a voice of his own – and PERDITOR use backing vocals, as opposed to VENOM. I could swear I heard some mid-period MARDUK-inspired moments in In Signo Suo, then again it was probably an acoustic fata morgana.</p>
<p>Anyways, this unpolished recording I still much more listenable than most raw/ ‘true’ BM releases (my deepest trauma still is MAYHEM’s Pure Fucking Armageddon), and it sounds quite interesting. I cannot tell you much more about the band, because the promo pack does not include further information. However, you cand raw your own conclusions from tracks like Hellstorm, Nekromantik, Chaotic Demonic Raging Madness, Forthcoming Millennium and Empire of the Black (is this a reinforcement of anti-racist theories here?&#8230;).</p>
<p>PERDITOR will surely please fans of VENOM, DARKTHRONE, MAYHEM and some other acts deep into the old school BM spirit. Musically, PERDITOR did not convince me entirely, but either I think this is a rather good release.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the early demos and split release material, GORATH’s Belgian BM is back with the first full-length via Black Owl Records, after the rave reviews to The Blueprints of Revolution (2004).<br />
<span id="more-1542"></span><br />
What can you expect from an album titled Elite? You might as well think this is one glorious manifestation of raw BM with extreme Scandinavian attitude and underground ideology, raw production and frosty sound – but you would be tremendously wrong. </p>
<p>This is Black Metal, aye, but with very good production and songwriting skills, all of which have been the result of one man’s efforts: F. Dupont. Besides writing, Dupont has also produced the album, and despite the drum machine, it is a nice album all in all, especially seeing as the usage of the drum machine is balanced with the song structures. Less frosty than it would be if raw produced, but this has completely new dimensions.</p>
<p>These dimensions are also supported by strictly acoustic moments in tracks like Instrumental Intermezzo, which add more melancholy. The songs have good dynamics and do not become too repetitive. As a bonus to older band fans, Elite features some older songs re-recorded. In addition to the nine tracks the album consists of, there is also a cover track – of Britney Spear’s Toxic.</p>
<p>GORATH is not a live band, but chances are it might be possible to see them perform in the future.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first few notes of Endless End clearly depict LEX TALIONIS as an experimentalist technical band verging on the industrial. And what is more, the whole album is faithfully portraying the quality of LT’s music. A significant influence of classical music also plays its role here. It takes some time to be fully digested, but this is one of the most interesting albums of 2003. In fact, I cannot quite remember the last time I heard something like this from French shores.<br />
<span id="more-1539"></span><br />
I must admit these guys manage to write catchy (though not radio-friendly) tunes – the opener Endless End is a fine example of it, my absolutely favorite track. Second favorite is Cyborg.</p>
<p>Technically, the musicians are very good and know how to put their knowledge to excellent use. LEX TALIONIS are Jeremy (vocals, keys), Pierre-Marie Reverdy (guitars), Yannick Morisset (guitar) and Nicolas Gleizes (bass). As you will probably have noticed by now, there is not a human drummer, which is what makes the album less meritorious in a way – but the drum machine is finely worked with mega-fast speed, which most of the times pleases the ear (although it need not be so fast all the time). I can understand the absence of a human drummer: LEX TALIONIS are into machines and in the end, it is a sign of coherence.</p>
<p>The general atmosphere of the album is rather martial, in a successful combination of death, black and some electro. The subtitle of the album (Fusion of ancient ways with modern tech. support) points at the predominance of technology, Cybernetics, punctuated with neoclassical and progressive solos every now and then. And leads are numerous throughout The Supreme Aggression.</p>
<p>Rises the Soul of Nature Immortal Myth is classical-inspired. The band’s heterogeneous direct or indirect influences are clearly stated in each member’s thanks list. As for the cover concept, the band’s idea of what is Extreme Aggression appears to be sticking needles in lips. I can imagine it hurts.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grave seems to have been positively flooded with decently above the average BM releases in the last couple of weeks. That two of the albums have been released by Ketzer Records cannot be just a coincidence.<br />
<span id="more-1536"></span><br />
The Germans (PEST) may stand metaphorically for the annihilation of humans and animals, and all creatures bound to be affected by the plague – and the music certainly corroborates this aspect. PEST sets to play Black Metal – chaotic, annihilating, motivating, devastating, the summons of hymns to the Dark Arts.</p>
<p>Vado Mori is a good follow-up to Ära, better on a number of levels, particularly in building the tension, creating cold music with an atmosphere of Doom and Darkness, surrounded by the Slivery Mist of Oblivion. Some sort of Hlidskjalf-era BURZUM, only faster and exclusively as the intro is concerned. The album starts acoustically, but most songs are violent BM assaults interspersed with interludes. The calm before the Storm. PEST had me on the third page of the booklet, with a quote from Edgar Allan Poe’s magnificent poem The Raven. Good taste, gentlemen. Good taste.</p>
<p>The Darkness leads Onwards and, untrue as it may sound, Mr Blasphemy (vocals), Alex (vocals, guitar, poetry), Scum (guitar, bass) and Mrkok (drums and keys) should be praised for so grim an offering. This is one of those albums with which you feel too many words will be a waste of time. Stick to the sound, stick to the concept. Stick to 45 minutes that blast their way to Hell.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a remote region somewhere in Carlsbad, New Mexico (not Germany), four souls gathered to form KRYOBURN. Despite the distance, the heavier music broke boundaries and transfigured into classic madness.<br />
<span id="more-1532"></span><br />
Comprised of Les and Chris Huber, Todd Brashear (guitar, vocals) and Derrick Richards, KRYOBURN were summoned to existence in 1995 as a METALLICA/ PANTERA cover band, but the originals soon followed. Touring the USA since 2000 with no label support has earned the band the name «touring machine»». But they would not remain out of the label spotlight for long. The debut full-length is now released by Continental/ Rawhead and is set to conquer the world of cyber/ industrial metal. </p>
<p>The song-writing is not as complex as MESHUGGAH’s, but some passages are inevitably similar. The FEAR FACTORY resemblance is not so much for the usual cyber components or the production – Todd Brashea’s vocals come close to Burton C. Bell’s, and they do not sound repetitive or plagiary. The music in general sounds slightly predictable, though. PANTERA is usually an established comparison, but KRYOBURN are not quite in that league – they are more cyber, definitely, and have the same type of melody to find in Resurrection FEAR FACTORY. But they also have the power to make one listen to their CD time and again.</p>
<p>Enigmatic Existence reveals the power of PANTERA’s music allied to early FEAR FACTORY atmosphere and a great deal of energy, power and conviction in the process. The production has been mentioned already – it was conducted by Eddy Garcia, of PISSING RAZORS/ MINISTRY, and features the ideal characteristics for a robotic metal band, i.e., cyber metal. For some, this whole album might be viewed as homage to FEAR FACTORY, but it certainly sounds like a good start for a band that will please younger generations massively. Possible commercial success.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A black CD in a black and white environment – MAPLE CROSS set themselves to presenting oppositions in their The Next Chapter. Fortunately, their intention is not contrary to excellent playing skills and song-writing!<br />
<span id="more-1525"></span><br />
Having created their own label Verikauha Records, the Fins release an opus of relentless variety in aggressiveness  &#8211; from heavy metal-inspired music to Thrash drumming and glimpses of melodic Death, what The Next Chapter represents is an album full of addicting tracks, clearly independent and intelligently conceived. </p>
<p>I cannot quite give you a name for what music MAPLE CROSS play, because the richness of its hybridism makes a unique sound, making The Next Chapter a plentiful listen. All of this is aided by the strong an powerful production, aided by screams/ clean vocals / throaty chants inspired by 80’s Thrash and a touch of Scandinavian madness. And then there is a heavy Rock’n’Roll groove to the Next Chapter which only makes it the more worthwhile listening. And always addicting. ENTOMBED is a band I could think of while listening to MAPLE CROSS, but in all honesty, MAPLE CROSS are by far much more interesting and much less tedious. In fact, I cannot seem to find a hint at boredom in MC’s music – and that is to say a lot.</p>
<p>The Next Chapter is intensity, variety, independence and personality, in a homogeneously created sound scape called «MAPLE CROSS».</p>
<p>Now the masterpiece was put forth by Marco R. J. (vocals), Sami (guitar), Late TT (guitar), Ollari (bass) and Aki (drums). Favorite moments could be World Wide Mystery and Nothing Starts from the Beginning, the best fucking moment of the whole album! And believe me, these are short but intensive 35 minutes – I want more.</p>
<p>Compulsory album for lovers of successful Death/ Thrash/ Personality/ Individuality.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Grave is going traditional. Older fellers may have heard the name before – UK’s prog rock MAGNUM have been around since 1976 and have released a good number of albums by now. Core members Bob Catley (vocals) and Tony Clarkin (guitar) come back mightily accompanied by Mark Stanway (keyboards), Harry James (drums) and Al Barrow (bass).<br />
<span id="more-1520"></span><br />
Preceding Brand New Morning is ’02 not particularly successful comeback CD Breath of Life. Polemics aside, Brand New Morning is fairly good and tight, most songs are mid-tempo. The problem with BNM is the fact that songs are exactly that: invariably mid-tempo. There are no particularly slow or particularly fast songs – and that is ultimately the bane of Brand New Morning – only if you are looking for variation anyway.</p>
<p>Musically, Brand New Morning is not very distant from albums like Vigilante or A Storyteller’s Night – 9 songs partially acoustic (the Blue and the Grey), with piano (the Last Goodbye) and plain good ol’ rock and roll.</p>
<p>Despite not being exactly an expert in traditional (semi-)progressive rock, it is not difficult to recognize the album’s worth, but it is also harder to come to terms with the dominating mid-tempo. The details are there and the recipe is very successful for fans of the old days – it is just that tiny little thing called ‘tempo changes’ that is lacking. Enjoyable, nevertheless.</p>
