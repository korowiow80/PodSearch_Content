      <title>A New Christ by Wallace D. Wattles - Part Four; Attaining Cosmic Consciousness and Demonstrations and Attainment</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/46803/600x600_667620.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part 4; A New Christ - In this 4 part series you are going to meet, perhaps for the first time, the real Jesus of Nazareth. You will learn what kind of man He really was, and what his true mission and purpose on earth was.
&lt;p&gt;This series will not attempt to prove something about Christ; it will be an effort to ascertain by scientific study, what He was, how He lived, and what He taught. Too many people have studied Jesus from the standpoint of some preconcieved notion of Him or His mission, such an attitude always leads to eroneous conclusions.
&lt;p&gt;From the Book &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;A New Christ&quot; by Wallace D. Wattles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href='http://thepdi.com/SuccessLibrary.htm' target='_blank'&gt;Click here for the complete text of this classic for only $1.99.&lt;/a&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Please help our Ministry by making a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thepdi.com/Donation.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;small donation&lt;/a&gt; through our sponsors, the Personal Development Institute and ourWorld.

      <itunes:summary>Part 4; A New Christ - In this 4 part series you are going to meet, perhaps for the first time, the real Jesus of Nazareth. You will learn what kind of man He really was, and what his true mission and purpose on earth was.
This series will not attempt to prove something about Christ; it will be an effort to ascertain by scientific study, what He was, how He lived, and what He taught. Too many people have studied Jesus from the standpoint of some preconcieved notion of Him or His mission, such an attitude always leads to eroneous conclusions.

We see it and recognize it. It is not lurking in the shadows, like a thief in the night waiting to surprise us; it is not out of sight over the horizon like a distant tornado which we need not fear. &lt;p&gt;No, the issue today is clear and ominous. If we use atomic fision in the world of force, we face doom. &lt;p&gt;We are compelled this time really to look at the two ways which Jesus told us about, the way of Caesar which is the way of violence and force, and the way of the Kingdom of God, which is the way of cooperation, compassion and fellowship. &lt;p&gt;If we think thoughts of Caesar's world we give our allegiance to Caesar; but if we think the thoughts of Jesus, our allegiance is to the Highest Power for good.

It has 66 chapters just as the Bible has 66 books. The 39 chapters of Isaiah speak for the most part of law and judgement just as the 39 books of the Old Testament. The 27 chapters of Isaiah speak of comfort, restoration, and mercy under the Messiah just as the 27 books of the New Testament speak of Jesus the Christ. Isaiah contains all that is found in the rest of the Bible. 
&lt;p&gt;Isaiah preached for over a period of about 40 years and his message covers just about every theme and doctrine of the Bible. Let us consider six of the Great Statements made in the book of Isaiah and their application to us Today.

You will learn what kind of man He really was, and what his true mission and purpose on earth was.
&lt;p&gt;This series will not attempt to prove something about Christ; it will be an effort to ascertain by scientific study, what He was, how He lived, and what He taught. Too many people have studied Jesus from the standpoint of some preconcieved notion of Him or His mission, such an attitude always leads to eroneous conclusions.

      <title>The meaning and purpose of God's Word - Segment Eight; The Importance of Brokenness</title>

But there is a shell, a very hard shell on the outside. As long as the shell is not split open, the wheat cannot grow.
&lt;p&gt;The question here is not whether life exists inside the shell, but whether the shell on the outside is cracked open.
