We hear from the Nigerian Union of Journalists about the challenges facing its members and from IWPR&#8217;s Veronica Oakeshott on how these were addressed through training workshops and story production. Also British journalism professor Ivor Gaber and Lanre Arogundade, the director of the Lagos-based International Press Centre, discuss the programme&#8217;s election-related news service, Nigerian Election News Report, which assisted participants with their reporting of the ballot and consider the role the initiative can play in the future.</description>
