<span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Scripture Reference:</strong> Exodus-30:34-38, Leviticus 10:1-2, and 2nd. Corinthians 2:14-17 (NKJV)</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><br />
Follow along with Pastor Crane as he speaks using the Bible verses below.<br />
<span style="color: #000000;"><br />
<sup id="en-NKJV-23284"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-563" title="Holy_Bible" src="http://www.cbcmidway.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Holy_Bible.jpg" alt="" width="60" height="44" /></sup></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Exodus 30:34-38  </strong>  34And the LORD said to Moses: “Take sweet spices, stacte and onycha and galbanum, and pure frankincense with these sweet spices; there shall be equal amounts of each. 35 You shall make of these an incense, a compound according to the art of the perfumer, salted, pure, and holy. 36 And you shall beat some of it very fine, and put some of it before the Testimony in the tabernacle of meeting where I will meet with you. It shall be most holy to you. 37 But as for the incense which you shall make, you shall not make any for yourselves, according to its composition. It shall be to you holy for the LORD. 38 Whoever makes any like it, to smell it, he shall be cut off from his people.”</p>
<p><strong>Leviticus 10:1-2    </strong> 1Then Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer and put fire in it, put incense on it, and offered profane fire before the LORD, which He had not commanded them. 2 So fire went out from the LORD and devoured them, and they died before the LORD.</p>
<p><strong>2nd. Corinthians 2:14-17   </strong>14Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place. 15 For we are to God the fragrance of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing. 16 To the one we are the aroma of death leading to death, and to the other the aroma of life leading to life. And who is sufficient for these things? 17 For we are not, as so many, peddling the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Because the Bible Studies that have been so popular on the CBC website, and the fact that they were on static html files, PDF files, or .doc files, we have now simplified the way in which people may access the Bible Studies.  All studies are now on our main site instead of a separate web server folder. </p>
<p>There are three ways to access the Bible Studies.  <strong>(1.)</strong> Visit the Bible Study Index page which is located <a href="http://www.cbcmidway.org/?page_id=1300"><strong>here</strong></a>.  <strong>(2.)</strong> Visit the complete &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbcmidway.org/?cat=1125"><strong>Archive Page</strong></a>&#8221; and scroll down until you find the one you want.  <strong>(3.)</strong> You can use the &#8220;<strong>Search</strong>&#8221; function at the top left of each page, just below the header.  All you need to do is to type in a pertinent word related to your desired study and hit &#8220;Search&#8221;.  You should receive numerous suggestions in this way.</p>
<p>Additionally, a language translation system has now been installed on the site!  That means that visitors who are not too familiar with the English language will now be able to translate all &#8220;Posts&#8221; and &#8220;Bible Studies&#8221; into their home language.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong>Note:  </strong><a href="http://www.cbcmidway.org/?p=1277"><strong>View Part One Here</strong></a></p>
<h5>LESSON 11 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 15:1-20</strong></p>
<p><em>1 Then the scribes and Pharisees who were from Jerusalem came to Jesus, saying, 2 “﻿Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.﻿”  3 He answered and said to them, “﻿Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition? 4 For God commanded, saying, ‘﻿Honor your father and your mother﻿’; and, ‘﻿He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.﻿’ <span id="more-1280"></span></em>5 But you say, ‘﻿Whoever says to his father or mother, “﻿Whatever profit you might have received from me is a gift to God﻿”— 6 then he need not honor his father or mother.﻿’ Thus you have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition. 7 Hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy about you, saying: 8 ‘﻿These people draw near to Me with their mouth, And honor Me with their lips, But their heart is far from Me.  9 And in vain they worship Me,</p>
<p>Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.﻿’ ﻿”</p>
<p>10 When He had called the multitude to Himself, He said to them, “﻿Hear and understand: 11 Not what goes into the mouth defiles a man; but what comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.﻿”  12 Then His disciples came and said to Him, “﻿Do You know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?﻿”  13 But He answered and said, “﻿Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted. 14 Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind leads the blind, both will fall into a ditch.﻿”  15 Then Peter answered and said to Him, “﻿Explain this parable to us.﻿”  16 So Jesus said, “﻿Are you also still without understanding? 17 Do you not yet understand that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and is eliminated? 18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man. 19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies. 20 These are the things which defile a man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile a man.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 16:1-19</strong></p>
<p><em>1 Then the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and testing Him asked that He would show them a sign from heaven. 2 He answered and said to them, “﻿When it is evening you say, ‘﻿It will be fair weather, for the sky is red﻿’; 3 and in the morning, ‘﻿It will be foul weather today, for the sky is red and threatening.﻿’ Hypocrites! You know how to discern the face of the sky, but you cannot discern the signs of the times. 4 A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign shall be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah.﻿” And He left them and departed.</em></p>
<p><em>5 Now when His disciples had come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. 6 Then Jesus said to them, “﻿Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.﻿”  7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “﻿It is because we have taken no bread.﻿”  8 But Jesus, being aware of it, said to them, “﻿O you of little faith, why do you reason among yourselves because you have brought no bread? 9 Do you not yet understand, or remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets you took up? 10 Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many large baskets you took up? 11 How is it you do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread?—but to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees.﻿” 12 Then they understood that He did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</em></p>
<p><em>13 When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, “﻿Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?﻿” 14 So they said, “﻿Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.﻿”</em></p>
<p><em>15 He said to them, “﻿But who do you say that I am?﻿” 16 Simon Peter answered and said, “﻿You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.﻿” 17 Jesus answered and said to him, “﻿Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. 18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. 19 And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.﻿”</em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 15:1-20</strong></p>
<p>The scribes and Pharisees were unrelenting in their efforts to trap Jesus. A delegation of them came from Jerusalem, charging His disciples with uncleanness for eating with their hands unwashed, therefore violating the tradition of the elders.  In order to appreciate this incident, we must understand the references to clean and unclean, and must know what the Pharisees meant by washing. The whole conception of clean and unclean goes back to the ﻿OT﻿. The uncleanness with which the disciples were charged was entirely a ceremonial matter. If a person touched a dead body, for instance, or if he ate certain things, he contracted ceremonial defilement—he was not ritually fit to worship God. Before he could approach God, the law of God required him to go through a cleansing ritual.  But the elders had added tradition to the cleansing rituals. They insisted, for instance, that before a Jew ate, he should put his hands through an elaborate cleansing process, washing not just the hands, but also the arms up to the elbows. If he had been in the marketplace, he was supposed to take a ceremonial bath. Thus, the Pharisees criticized the disciples for failing to observe the intricacies of the washings prescribed by Jewish tradition.</p>
<p>Jesus reminded His critics that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">they</span> transgressed the commandment of God, not simply the tradition of the elders. The law commanded men to honor their parents, including supporting them financially if necessary. But the scribes and Pharisees (and many others) did not want to spend money for the support of their aged parents. So they devised a tradition by which to avoid their responsibility. When asked for help by father or mother, all they had to do was recite such words as these: “Any money which I have and which could be used to support you has been dedicated to God, and therefore I cannot give it to you,”  (quorban); and having recited this formula, they were free from financial responsibility to their parents. Following this devious tradition they had thus nullified the Word of God which commanded them to care for their parents.</p>
<p>By their crafty twisting of words they fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah 29:13. They professed to honor God with their lips, but their heart was far from Him. Their worship was worthless because they were giving higher priority to the traditions of men than to the Word of God.  Turning to the multitude, Jesus made a pronouncement of tremendous significance. He declared that not what goes into the mouth defiles a man, but rather what comes out. We can scarcely appreciate the revolutionary character of this statement. Under the Levitical code, what went into the mouth did defile a man. The Jews were forbidden to eat the meat of any animal which did not chew the cud and have cloven hooves. They were not allowed to eat a fish unless it had scales and fins.  Very definite instructions were given by God as to foods that were clean or unclean.</p>
<p>Now the Law-giver announced the real purpose for the Laws regarding foods; not to focus on the food, but to focus on the concept of INNER purity and wholesomeness.  He said that the food which His disciples ate with unwashed hands did not defile them. But the hypocrisy of the scribes and Pharisees—that was truly defiling.   When His disciples brought word that the Pharisees were offended by this denunciation, Jesus answered by comparing them to plants which had not been divinely planted. They were tares rather than wheat. They and their teachings would eventually be rooted up; that is, destroyed.  Though professing to be authorities in spiritual matters, they were as blind to spiritual realities as were the people they were leading. It was inevitable that both leaders and followers would fall into a ditch.</p>
<p>The disciples were undoubtedly shaken by this complete reversal of all they had been taught about clean and unclean foods.  Peter verbalized their unsettlement when he asked for an explanation.  The Lord first expressed wonder that they were so slow to understand, then explained that true defilement is moral, not physical. Edible foods are not intrinsically clean or unclean. In fact, no material thing is evil in itself; it is the abuse of a thing that is wrong. The food man eats enters the mouth, goes into the stomach for digestion, then the unassimilated residue is eliminated. His moral being is not affected—only his body. Today we know that “every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer” (1 Tim. 4:4, 5). The passage is not speaking of poisonous plants, of course, but of foods designed by God for human consumption. All are good and should be eaten thankfully. If a person is allergic to some, or cannot tolerate others, he shouldn’t eat them, but in general we can eat with the assurance that God uses food to nourish us physically.   If food doesn’t defile, then what does? Jesus answered, “&#8230; those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.” Here the heart is not the organ that pumps blood, but the corrupt source of human motives and desires. This part of man’s moral nature manifests itself by impure thoughts, then by depraved words, then by evil acts.   Some of the things that defile a man are evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, and blasphemies, (this Greek word includes slander of others).</p>
<p>The Pharisees and scribes were extremely careful concerning the ostentatious, punctilious observance of hand-washing ceremonies. But their inner lives were polluted. They majored in minors and overlooked the matters of real importance. They could criticize the disciples’ failure to keep uninspired traditions, yet plot to kill the Son of God and be guilty of the whole catalog of sin listed in verse 19.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 16:1-19</strong></p>
<p>The Pharisees and Sadducees represented two doctrinal extremes. But their hostility gave way to cooperation as they united in a common aim to trip up the Lord.  To test Him they asked Him to demonstrate a sign from heaven.  They were trying to put Him into a compromising position by getting Him to do some form of “miracle” that they could then call a demonic “sign”.  He answered by continuing the theme of the sky. When they saw a red sky in the evening, they forecast fair weather for the next day. They also knew that a red, threatening sky in the morning meant storms for that day. They had expertise in interpreting the appearance of the sky, but they could not interpret the signs of the times.</p>
<p>What were these signs? The prophet who heralded the advent of the Messiah had appeared in the person of John the Baptist. The miracles prophesied of the Messiah—things no other man had ever done—had been performed in their presence. Another sign of the times was the obvious rejection of the Messiah by the Jews and the movement of the gospel to the Gentiles, all in fulfillment of prophecy. Yet in spite of this incontrovertible evidence, they had no sense of history being made or of prophecy being fulfilled.</p>
<p>In seeking for a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sign</span> when He Himself stood in their midst, the Pharisees and Sadducees exposed themselves as an evil, spiritually adulterous generation. No sign would now be given to them except the sign of the prophet Jonah.  This would be the resurrection of Christ on the third day. A wicked and adulterous generation would crucify its Messiah, but God would raise Him from the dead.</p>
<p>The paragraph closes with the ominous words, “And He left them and departed.” The spiritual implications of the words should be obvious to all.</p>
<p>When His disciples rejoined the Lord on the east side of the lake, they had forgotten to take food with them. Therefore when Jesus greeted them with a warning to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, they thought He was saying, “Don’t go to those Jewish leaders for food supplies!” Their preoccupation with food caused them to look for a literal, natural explanation where a spiritual lesson was intended.  They were still worrying about a food shortage in spite of the fact that He who fed the 5,000 and the 4,000 was with them. So He reviewed the two miraculous feedings with them. The lesson that emerged concerned divine arithmetic and divine resourcefulness, for the less Jesus had to work with, the more He fed, and the more food there was left over. When there were only five loaves and two fish, He fed 5,000 plus and had twelve baskets of food left. With more loaves and fish, He fed only 4,000 plus and had left over only seven basketfuls. If we put our limited resources at His disposal, He can multiply them in inverse proportion to their amount. “Little is much if God is in it.”</p>
<p>In speaking of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees, the Lord had not referred to bread but to evil doctrine and conduct.  <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The leaven of the Pharisees is hypocrisy</span></em></strong>. They professed to study and follow the Word of God in smallest details, yet their obedience was external and shallow. Inwardly they were evil and corrupt.  <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The leaven of the Sadducees was rationalism</span></em></strong>. The freethinkers of their day, they, like the liberals of today, had built a system of doubts and denials. They denied the existence of angels and spirits, the resurrection of the body, the immortality of the soul, and eternal punishment. This leaven of skepticism, if tolerated, will spread and permeate like yeast in meal.</p>
<p><strong>Peter’s Great Confession (16:13–19) </strong></p>
<p>Up to this time, Jesus He had been leading His disciples to a true understanding of His Person as the Messiah.  Having succeeded in this, He now begins His journey to the cross.   He began by asking His disciples what men were saying as to His identity. The replies ran the gamut from John the Baptist, to Elijah, to Jeremiah, to one of the other prophets. To the average person He was one among many. Good, but not the Best. Great, but not the Greatest. A prophet, but not <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">the</span></em></strong> Prophet. This view would never do.  If He were only another man He was a fraud because He claimed to be equal with God the Father.</p>
<p>So He asked the disciples who they believed He was. This brought from Simon Peter the historic confession, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” In other words, He was Israel’s Messiah and God the Son.   Jesus pronounced a blessing on Simon, son of Jonah. The fisherman had not arrived at this concept of the Lord through intellect or native wisdom; it had been supernaturally revealed to him by God the Father. But the Son had something important to say to Peter also. So Jesus added, “And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.” We all know that more controversy has swirled around this verse than almost any other verse in the Gospel. The question is, “Who or what is the rock?” Part of the problem arises from the fact that the Greek words for Peter and for rock are similar, but the meanings are different. The first, petros, means a stone or loose rock; the second, petra, means rock, such as a rocky ledge. So what Jesus really said was “ &#8230; you are Peter (stone), and on this rock I will build My church.” He did not say He would build His church on a stone but on a rock.</p>
<p>If Peter is not the rock, then what is? If we stick to the context, the obvious answer is that the rock is Peter’s confession that Christ is the Son of the living God, the truth on which the church is founded. Ephesians 2:20 teaches that the church is built on Jesus Christ, the chief cornerstone. Its statement that we are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets refers not to them, but to the foundation laid in their teachings concerning the Lord Jesus Christ.   Christ is spoken of as a Rock in 1 Corinthians 10:4.  In this connection, a commentator named Morgan gives a helpful reminder:   “Remember, He was talking to Jews. If we trace the figurative use of the word rock through Hebrew Scriptures, we find that it is never used symbolically of man, but always of God. So here at Caesarea Philippi, it is not upon Peter that the Church is built. Jesus did not trifle with figures of speech. He took up their old Hebrew illustration—rock, always the symbol of Deity—and said, “Upon God Himself —Christ, the Son of the living God—I will build my church.”</p>
<p>“I will build My church.” Here we have the first mention of the church in the Bible. It did not exist in the ﻿OT﻿. The church, still future when Jesus spoke these words, was formed on the Day of Pentecost and is composed of all true believers in Christ, both Jew and Gentile, Spirit-indwelt.  “The gates of Hades shall not prevail against it”.   The powers of death will be defeated by the translation of living believers and by the resurrection of the dead in Christ.</p>
<p>“I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven” does not mean that Peter was given authority to admit men to heaven.  Keys speak of access or entrance. The keys which open the door of profession of faith are given in the Great Commission (Matt. 28:19)—discipling, baptizing, and teaching.  Peter first used the keys on the Day of Pentecost. They were not given to him exclusively, but as a representative of all the disciples. (See Matt. 18:18 where the same promise is given to them all.)</p>
<p>“Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.” This and a companion passage in John 20:23 are sometimes used to teach that Peter and his supposed successors were given the authority to forgive sins. We know that this cannot be so; only God can forgive sins.  What this refers to is a Hebrew concept called “halachah”; the allowing (or not allowing) of certain behaviors or actions based upon God’s Word, and is an authority that even Pastors in the modern age are supposed to use carefully and properly.</p>
<p><strong>A Study On “Binding And Loosing (Halachah)</strong></p>
<p>Since the modern Pastor is often called upon to guide and instruct his flock on matters that are not specifically mentioned in Scripture (due to changes in culture and practice), he needs to have a grounding in the authority that he has been given by Jesus in the area of interpretation and application of God&#8217;s Word.  This is an awesome responsibility, and is never to be entered into lightly.  It is to be done reverentially, and with a consistent and proper handling of God&#8217;s Word as the ultimate authority. </p>
<p><strong>BINDING AND LOOSING</strong> — a phrase describing the authority and power that Jesus assigned to His disciples, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">allowing them to forbid or allow certain kinds of conduct.</span></strong>   This phrase occurs only twice in the New Testament. In the first instance (Matt. 16:19), Jesus gave Peter “the keys of the kingdom of heaven” and told him “whatever you bind on earth will be bound [literally, “shall have been bound”] in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed [“shall have been loosed”] in heaven.” This means that Peter was granted the authority to pronounce the freedom or condemnation of a person in areas of behavior. The tense of the verbs “shall have been” indicates that this fact was already established in the will of the Father.      In Matthew 18:18 the same words were spoken by Jesus to all the disciples, granting them authority in matters of church discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 23:1-4</strong></p>
<p>1Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 2Saying,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat: 3All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, <em>that</em> observe and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</span></strong> 4For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay <em>them</em> on men’s shoulders; but they <em>themselves</em> will not move them with one of their fingers.</p>
<p><strong><em>The King James Version</em>.</strong></p>
<p>In the Old Testament, Hezekiah, king of Judah, chose a body of men who transcribed the ancient records for preservation, including the proverbs of Solomon (Prov. 25:1). The nature of the scribe’s work had changed by the time of Christ. He was no longer an officer of the king’s court; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">he had become a person who interpreted the Scriptures. The scribes soon became known for their study and knowledge of the Mosaic Law.</span></strong></p>
<p>After the Jews returned from the Captivity in Babylon, the era of the scribes began. The reading of the Law before the nation of Israel by Ezra (Nehemiah 8–10) signaled the nation’s return to exact observance of all the laws and rites that had been given. Following the Law and the traditions that had grown up around it became the measure of devotion and spirituality.</p>
<p>At first the priests were responsible for the study and professional communication of this legal code. But this function eventually passed to the scribes. Their official interpretation of the meaning of the Law eventually became more important than the Law itself.  This position of strength allowed these early scribes to enforce their rules and practices with a binding authority. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To speak of the scribes as interpreters of Scripture means that they provided rules for human conduct out of their study.</span></strong></p>
<p>By the time of Jesus, the scribes were a new upper class among the Jewish people. Large numbers of priests in Jerusalem before A.D.. 70 served as scribes. One of these was Josephus, the Jewish historian. Some scribes came from among the Sadducees. Others came from the ordinary priestly ranks. But the largest group of scribes came from among every other class of people, including merchants, carpenters, flax combers, tentmakers, and even day laborers, like Hillel, who became a famous Jewish teacher.</p>
<p>The young Israelite who devoted his life to become a scribe went through a set course of study for several years. Josephus began his preparation when he was 14. Students were in continual contact with the teacher, listening to his instruction. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The disciple-scribe first had to master all the traditional material and the unique method of interpretation of the Jewish Halachah. The aim was to give the apprentice competence in making decisions on questions of religious legislation and penal justice.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The city of Jerusalem was the center of this scribal knowledge and interpretation of the Law. Only ordained teachers could transmit and create the tradition; this was the matter studied to perfection by students often beginning at age 14. When they completed their study at the age of 40, they could be ordained. As members with full rights, they could act as judges, be called rabbis, and occupy positions in administration of justice, government, and education.</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sometimes the gospels refer to the scribes as lawyers (Matt. 22:35; Luke 7:30)—a title that identifies them as experts in the Mosaic Law. This Law was regarded as the sole civil and religious authority governing Jewish life.</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Christ allows their office as expositors of the law; <em>The scribes and Pharisees they sit in Moses’ seat </em>(v. 2), as public teachers and interpreters of the law; and, the law of Moses being the municipal law of their state, they were as judges, or a bench of justices; teaching and judging seem to be equivalent, comparing 2 Chr. 17:7, 9, with 2 Chr. 19:5, 6, 8.  They expounded the law, and taught the people how to apply it to particular cases. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;Whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> As far as they <em>sit in Moses’s seat,</em> that is, read and preach the law that was given by Moses’’ (which, as yet, continued in full force, power, and virtue), &#8220;and judge according to that law, so far you must hearken to them, as remembrances to you of the written word.’’ The scribes and Pharisees made it their business to study the scripture, and were well acquainted with the language, history, and customs of it, and its style and phraseology. Now Christ would have the people to make use of the helps they gave them for the understanding of the scripture, and do accordingly. As long as their comments did illustrate the text and not pervert it; did make plain, and not <em>make void, the commandment of God;</em> so far they must be observed and obeyed, but with caution and a judgment of discretion.</span>&#8220;           </p>
<p><em>The development of a specific application of the Law is called in Hebrew a &#8220;halacha&#8221;.  In order for the modern Pastor to develop &#8220;halacha&#8221; that apply to the situations that he is confronted with today; the following concepts must be kept in view at all times:</em></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A) No &#8220;halacha&#8221; must ever contradict a plainly stated precept of God&#8217;s Word.</span></strong>    For example, numerous modern &#8220;liberal&#8221; theologians have stated that homosexual behavior is allowable, as long as it is done in a &#8220;loving, committed relationship&#8221;.  However, this flies in the face of the revealed Word of God which plainly states that homosexuality is an abomination to God, and that those who engage in such activity will never inherit the kingdom of heaven.  This is a case where &#8220;political correctness&#8221; and personal agenda has resulted in a truly faulty &#8220;halacha&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">B) All &#8220;halacha&#8221; must be administered by the Pastor in the love of Christ, and to glorify HIM, not ourselves.</span></strong></p>
<p>The complaint that Jesus had against the Scribes was not that they administered the Law of Moses; it was the arrogance, pride, and hypocrisy with which they did so.  Pastors should never allow the people in their congregation to begin to treat them as &#8220;guru&#8217;s&#8221;, the source of all wisdom.  Our handling of God&#8217;s Word is a privilege that we have been given by grace, not a right that we have earned by our intelligence or skill.  All of our decisions should promote the glory of God, and should always be consistent with a humble, pure, and holy Christian life. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">C) Participants in a &#8220;halacha&#8221; should understand that a proper &#8220;halacha&#8221; IS BINDING, and that they are responsible for carrying it out.</span></strong></p>
<p>If the &#8220;halacha&#8221; has been properly arrived at, the Pastor has the authority to make it binding upon those involved.  Although the Pastor has no earthly authority to enforce it, his authority is seen in heaven, and the people involved will be held to it.  For example, if a couple seeks permission to marry, having been previously divorced, and the Pastor determines that they are NOT in a position to marry, and forbids them to marry; they might go to another Pastor, or to a Justice of the Peace, and marry anyway.  The Pastor cannot legally stop them, but their knowledge of his &#8220;halacha&#8221; will be held against them in terms of heavenly judgment, especially as it concerns the blessings of God being on their marriage.  This can have long-reaching consequences, especially if children result from the marriage.  Although the grace of God is always available to the repentant, willful disobedience of a properly given &#8220;halacha&#8221; is rebellion, and would be considered a sin as such, needing true repentance in order to be overcome.</p>
<h5>LESSON 12 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 16:21-28</strong></p>
<p>21 From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day.  22 Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, “﻿Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!﻿”  23 But He turned and said to Peter, “﻿Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.﻿”  24 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “﻿If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me. 25 For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. 26 For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?  27 For the Son of Man will come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then He will reward each according to his works. 28 Assuredly, I say to you, there are some standing here who shall not taste death till they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom.﻿”</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 17:14-21</strong></p>
<p>14 And when they had come to the multitude, a man came to Him, kneeling down to Him and saying, 15 “﻿Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers severely; for he often falls into the fire and often into the water. 16 So I brought him to Your disciples, but they could not cure him.﻿”  17 Then Jesus answered and said, “﻿O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him here to Me.﻿” 18 And Jesus rebuked the demon, and it came out of him; and the child was cured from that very hour.  19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “﻿Why could we not cast it out?﻿”  20 So Jesus said to them, “﻿Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘﻿Move from here to there,﻿’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. 21 However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 17:24-27</strong></p>
<p>24 When they had come to Capernaum, those who received the temple tax came to Peter and said, “﻿Does your Teacher not pay the temple tax?﻿”  25 He said, “﻿Yes.﻿”</p>
<p>And when he had come into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “﻿What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs or taxes, from their sons or from strangers?﻿”  26 Peter said to Him, “﻿From strangers.﻿”  Jesus said to him, “﻿Then the sons are free. 27 Nevertheless, lest we offend them, go to the sea, cast in a hook, and take the fish that comes up first. And when you have opened its mouth, you will find a piece of money; take that and give it to them for Me and you.﻿”</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 18:1-20</strong></p>
<p>At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “﻿Who then is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?﻿”  2 Then Jesus called a little child to Him, set him in the midst of them, 3 and said, “﻿Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. 4 Therefore whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. 5 Whoever receives one little child like this in My name receives Me.</p>
<p>6 “﻿Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to sin, it would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the sea. 7 Woe to the world because of offenses! For offenses must come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!</p>
<p>8 “﻿If your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life lame or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet, to be cast into the everlasting fire. 9 And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire.</p>
<p>10 “﻿Take heed that you do not despise one of these little ones, for I say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of My Father who is in heaven. 11 For the Son of Man has come to save that which was lost.</p>
<p>12 “﻿What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine and go to the mountains to seek the one that is straying? 13 And if he should find it, assuredly, I say to you, he rejoices more over that sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray. 14 Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</p>
<p>15 “﻿Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. 16 But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that ‘﻿by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.﻿’ 17 And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector.</p>
<p>18 “﻿Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.</p>
<p>19 “﻿Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. 20 For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparing the Disciples for His Death and Resurrection (16:21–28) </span></em></strong></p>
<p>Now that the disciples had realized that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of the living God, they were ready to hear His first direct prediction of His death and resurrection.  He must go to Jerusalem, must suffer many things from the religious leaders, must be killed, and be raised the third day. The news was enough to spell the doom of any movement—all except that last imperative—must &#8230; be raised the third day. That made the difference!</p>
<p>Peter was indignant at the thought of his Master’s enduring such treatment. Catching hold of Him as if to block His path, he protested, “Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!”   This drew a rebuke from the Lord Jesus. He had come into the world to die for sinners. Anything or anyone who hindered Him from this purpose was out of tune with God’s will. So He said to Peter, “Get behind Me, Satan! You are an offense to Me, for you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men.” In calling Peter Satan, Jesus did not imply that the apostle was demon-possessed or Satan-controlled. He simply meant that Peter’s actions and words were what could be expected of Satan (whose name means adversary). By protesting against Calvary, Peter became a hindrance to the Savior.  Every Christian is called to take up his cross and follow the Lord Jesus, but when the cross looms in the pathway ahead, a voice within says, “Far be it from you! Save yourself.” Or perhaps the voices of loved ones seek to deflect us from the path of obedience. At such times, we too must say, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me.”</p>
<p>Now the Lord Jesus plainly states what is involved in being His disciple: denial of self, cross-bearing, and following Him. To deny self is not the same as self-denial; it means to yield to His control so completely that self has no rights whatever. To take up the cross means the willingness to endure shame, suffering, and perhaps martyrdom for His sake; to die to sin, self, and the world.</p>
<p>The Lord anticipates two hindrances to discipleship. The first is the natural temptation to save oneself from discomfort, pain, loneliness, or loss. The other is to become wealthy. As to the first, Jesus warned that those who hug their lives for selfish purposes would never find fulfillment; those who recklessly abandon their lives to Him, not counting the cost, would find the reason for their existence.   The second temptation—that of getting rich—is irrational. “Suppose,” said Jesus, “that a man became so successful in business that he owned the whole world. This mad quest would absorb so much of his time and energy that he would miss the central purpose of his life. What good would it do to make all that money, then die, leave it all behind, and spend eternity empty-handed?”</p>
<p>He next made the startling statement that there were some standing there with Him who would not taste death before they saw Him coming in His kingdom. The problem, of course, is that those disciples have all died, yet Christ has not come in power and glory to set up His kingdom. The problem is solved if we disregard the chapter break and consider the first eight verses of the next chapter as an explanation of His statement. These verses describe the incident on the Mount of Transfiguration. There Peter, James, and John saw Christ transfigured. They were actually privileged to have a preview of Christ in the glory of His kingdom.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparation for Service through Prayer and Fasting (17:14–21) </span></em></strong></p>
<p>Life is not all a mountain-top experience. After moments of spiritual exhilaration come hours and days of toil and expenditure. The time comes when we must leave the mountain to minister in the valley of human need.   At the base of the mountain where the Transfiguration had taken place, a distraught father was waiting for the Savior. Kneeling down before Him, he poured out his impassioned plea that his demon-possessed son might be healed. The son suffered from violent epileptic seizures which sometimes caused him to fall into the fire and often into the water, so his misery was compounded by burns and near-drownings.   The father had gone to the disciples for help, only to learn that they had been powerless to cure.</p>
<p>“O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you?” is addressed to the disciples.  As soon as the epileptic was brought to Him, Jesus rebuked the demon, and the sufferer was instantly cured.  Puzzled by their powerlessness, the disciples privately asked the Lord for an explanation. His answer was straightforward: unbelief. If they had faith the size of a mustard seed (the smallest of seeds), they could command a mountain to be cast into the sea and it would happen. Of course, it should be understood that true faith must be based upon some command or promise of God. Expecting to perform some spectacular stunt in order to gratify a personal whim is not faith but presumption. But if God guides a believer in a certain direction or issues a command, the Christian can have utmost confidence that mountainous difficulties will be miraculously removed. Nothing is impossible to those who believe.</p>
<p>The directive for prayer and fasting is a command to employ spiritual weapons when involved in spiritual warfare.  Although not every “warfare” problem requires dedicated times of prayer and fasting, there are occasions where these disciplines need to be employed to overcome a particularly intense or deep-rooted enemy.</p>
<p><strong>Peter and His Master Pay Their Taxes (17:24–27) </strong></p>
<p>In Capernaum the collectors of the temple tax asked Peter if his Teacher paid the half-shekel used for carrying on the costly temple service. Peter answered, “Yes.” Perhaps the misguided disciple wanted to save Christ from embarrassment.  The omniscience of the Lord is seen in what followed. When Peter came home, Jesus spoke to him first—before Peter had a chance to tell what had happened. “What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth take customs and taxes, from their sons or from strangers?” The question must be understood in the light of those days. A ruler taxed his subjects for the support of his kingdom and his family, but he didn’t tax his own family. Under our form of government, everyone is taxed, including the ruler and his household.  Peter correctly answered that rulers collected tribute from strangers. Jesus then pointed out that the sons are free. The point was that the temple was God’s house. For Jesus, the Son of God, to pay tribute for the support of this temple would be equivalent to paying tribute to Himself.  However, rather than cause needless offense, the Lord agreed to pay the tax. But what would He do for money? It is never recorded that Jesus personally carried money. He sent Peter to the Sea of Galilee and told him to bring up the first fish he caught. In the mouth of that fish was a piece of money, one shekel, which Peter used to pay the tribute—one-half for the Lord Jesus and one-half for himself.  This astounding miracle, narrated with utmost restraint, clearly demonstrates Christ’s omniscience. He knew which one of all the fish in the Sea of Galilee had a shekel in its mouth. He knew the location of that one fish. And he knew it would be the first fish Peter would catch.  If any divine principle had been involved, Jesus would not have made the payment. It was a matter of moral indifference to Him, and He was willing to pay rather than offend. We as believers are free from the law. Yet, in non-moral matters, we should respect the consciences of others, and not do anything that would cause offense.</p>
<p><strong>Concerning Humility (18:1–6) </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Chapter 18 has been called the discourse on greatness and forgiveness. It outlines principles of conduct that are suitable for those who claim to be subjects of Christ the King. </em></strong></p>
<p>The disciples had always thought of the kingdom of heaven as the golden age of peace and prosperity. Now they began to covet positions of preferment in it. Their self-seeking spirit found expression in the question, “Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”  Jesus answered with a living object lesson. Placing a little child in their midst, He said that men must be converted and become as little children to enter the kingdom of heaven. He was speaking of the kingdom in its inward reality; in order to be a genuine believer a man must abandon thoughts of personal greatness and take the lowly position of a little child. This begins when he acknowledges his sinfulness and unworthiness and receives Jesus Christ as his only hope. This attitude should continue throughout his Christian life. Jesus was not implying that His disciples were not saved. All except Judas had true faith in Him, and were therefore justified. But they had not yet received the Holy Spirit as an indwelling Person, and therefore lacked the power for true humility that we have available to us today (but most of the time do not use as we should).   The greatest person in the kingdom of heaven is the one who humbles himself as a little child. Obviously the standards and values in the kingdom are exactly opposite those in the world. Our whole mode of thinking must be reversed; we must think Christ’s thoughts (see Phil. 2:5–8).</p>
<p>Here the Lord Jesus glides almost imperceptibly from the subject of a natural child to a spiritual child. Whoever receives one of His humble followers in His name will be rewarded as if he had received the Lord Himself. What is done for the disciple is reckoned as done for the Master.  On the other hand, anyone who seduces a believer to sin incurs enormous condemnation; it would be better for him to have a great millstone tied around his neck and be drowned in the ocean’s depths. (The great millstone referred to here required an animal to turn it; a smaller one could be turned by hand.) It is bad enough to sin against oneself, but to cause a believer to sin is to destroy his innocence, corrupt his mind, and stain his reputation. Better to die a violent death than to trifle with another’s purity! </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Concerning Offenses (18:7–14) </strong></span></p>
<p>Jesus went on to explain that it is inevitable that offenses should arise. The world, the flesh, and the devil are leagued to seduce and pervert. But if a person becomes an agent for the forces of evil, his guilt will be great. So the Savior warned men to take drastic action in disciplining themselves rather than to tempt a child of God.  Whether the sinning member is the hand or foot or the eye, better to sacrifice it to the surgeon’s knife than to let it destroy the work of God in another person’s life. Better to enter into life without limbs or sight than to be consigned to hell with every member intact. Our Lord does not imply that some bodies will lack limbs in heaven, but merely describes the physical condition at the time a believer leaves this life for the next. There can be no question that the resurrection body will be complete and perfect.</p>
<p>Next the Son of God warned against despising one of His little ones, whether children or any who belong to the kingdom. To emphasize their importance, He added that their angels are constantly in the presence of God, beholding His face. Angels here probably means guardian angels (see also Heb. 1:14).</p>
<p>These little ones are also the object of the tender Shepherd’s saving ministry. Even if one out of a hundred sheep goes astray, He leaves the ninety-nine and searches for the lost one till He finds it. The Shepherd’s joy over finding a straying sheep should teach us to value and respect His little ones.   They are important not only to the angels and to the Shepherd, but also to God the Father. It is not His will that one of them should perish. If they are important enought to engage angels, the Lord Jesus, and God the Father, then clearly we should never despise them, no matter how unlovely or lowly they might appear</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Concerning Discipline of Offenders (18:15–20) </span></em></strong></p>
<p>Explicit instructions are given concerning the Christian’s responsibility when wronged by another believer. First, the matter should be handled privately between the two parties. If the offender acknowledges his guilt, reconciliation is achieved. The trouble is that we don’t do this. We gossip to everyone else about it. Then the matter spreads like wildfire and strife is multiplied. Let us remember that step number one is to “go and tell him his fault between you and him alone.”   If the guilty brother does not listen, then the wronged one should take one or two others with him, seeking his restoration. This emphasizes the mounting seriousness of his continued unbrokenness. But more, it provides competent testimony, as required by the Scripture: “that ‘by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established’.” (Deut. 19:15). No one can measure the trouble that has plagued the church through failure to obey the simple rule that a charge against another person must be supported by the testimony of two or three others. In this respect, worldly courts often act more righteously than Christian churches or assemblies.</p>
<p>If the accused still refuses to confess and apologize, the matter should be taken before the local church. It is important to notice that the local assembly is the body responsible to hear the case, not a civil court. The Christian is forbidden to go to law against another believer (1 Cor. 6:1–8).   If the defendant refuses to admit his wrong before the church, then he is to be considered a heathen and a tax collector. The most obvious meaning of this expression is that he should be looked upon as being outside the sphere of the church. Though he may be a true believer, he is not living as one, and should therefore be treated accordingly. Though still in the universal church, he should be barred from the privileges of the local church. Such discipline is a serious action; it temporarily delivers a believer to the power of Satan “for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus” (1 Cor. 5:5). The purpose of this is to bring him to his senses and cause him to confess his sin. Until that point is reached, believers should treat him courteously but should also show by their attitude that they do not condone his sin and cannot have fellowship with him as a fellow believer. The assembly should be prompt to receive him back as soon as there is evidence of godly repentance.</p>
<p>Verse 18 is linked with what precedes. When an assembly, prayerfully and in obedience to the Word, binds disciplinary action upon a person, that action is honored in heaven. When the disciplined person has repented and confessed his sin, and the assembly restores him to fellowship, that loosing action, too, is ratified by God (see John 20:23).   The question arises, “How large must an assembly be before it can bind and loose, as described above?” The answer is that two believers may bring such matters to God in prayer with the assurance of being heard. While verse 19 may be used as a general promise of answers to prayer, in the context it refers to prayer concerning church discipline. When used in connection with collective prayer in general, it must be taken in light of all other teaching on prayer. For instance, our prayers must be:</p>
<p>1. In conformity to the revealed will of God (1 Jn. 5:14, 15).</p>
<p>2. In faith (Jas. 1:6–8).</p>
<p>3. In sincerity (Heb. 10:22a), etc.</p>
<p>Verse 20 should be interpreted in light of its context. It does not refer primarily to the composition of a NT church in its simplest form, nor to a general prayer meeting, but to a meeting where the church seeks the reconciliation of two Christians separated by some sin. It may legitimately be applied to all meetings of believers where Christ is the Center, but a specific type of meeting is in view here.   To meet “in His name” means by His authority, in acknowledgment of all that He is, and in obedience to His Word. No group can claim to be the only ones who meet in His name; if that were so, His presence would be limited to a small segment of His body on earth. Wherever two or three are gathered in recognition of Him as Lord and Savior, he is there in the midst.</p>
<h5>LESSON 13 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 18:21-35</strong></p>
<p>21 Then Peter came to Him and said, “﻿Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?﻿”  22 Jesus said to him, “﻿I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. 23 Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. 24 And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. 25 But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made. 26 The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, ‘﻿Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.﻿’ 27 Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.  28 “﻿But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, ‘﻿Pay me what you owe!﻿’ 29 So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘﻿Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.﻿’ 30 And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt. 31 So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done. 32 Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, ‘﻿You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. 33 Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?﻿’ 34 And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him.  35 “﻿So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 19:3-12</strong></p>
<p>3 The Pharisees also came to Him, testing Him, and saying to Him, “﻿Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for just any reason?﻿”  4 And He answered and said to them, “﻿Have you not read that He who made them at the beginning ‘﻿made them male and female,﻿’ 5 and said, ‘﻿For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh﻿’ ? 6 So then, they are no longer two but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.﻿”</p>
<p>7 They said to Him, “﻿Why then did Moses command to give a certificate of divorce, and to put her away?﻿”  8 He said to them, “﻿Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. 9 And I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery.﻿”  10 His disciples said to Him, “﻿If such is the case of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry.﻿”  11 But He said to them, “﻿All cannot accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been given: 12 For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He who is able to accept it, let him accept it.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Matthew 19:16-20:16</strong></span></p>
<p>16 Now behold, one came and said to Him, “﻿Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?﻿”  17 So He said to him, “﻿Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.﻿”  18 He said to Him, “﻿Which ones?﻿”  Jesus said, “﻿‘﻿You shall not murder,﻿’ ‘﻿You shall not commit adultery,﻿’ ‘﻿You shall not steal,﻿’ ‘﻿You shall not bear false witness,﻿’ 19 ‘﻿Honor your father and your mother,﻿’ and, ‘﻿You shall love your neighbor as yourself.﻿’﻿”  20 The young man said to Him, “﻿All these things I have kept from my youth. What do I still lack?﻿”  21 Jesus said to him, “﻿If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.﻿”  22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.  23 Then Jesus said to His disciples, “﻿Assuredly, I say to you that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. 24 And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.﻿”  25 When His disciples heard it, they were greatly astonished, saying, “﻿Who then can be saved?﻿”  26 But Jesus looked at them and said to them, “﻿With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.﻿”  27 Then Peter answered and said to Him, “﻿See, we have left all and followed You. Therefore what shall we have?﻿”  28 So Jesus said to them, “﻿Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 29 And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life. 30 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.       1 “﻿For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. 2 Now when he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. 3 And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace, 4 and said to them, ‘﻿You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.﻿’ So they went. 5 Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did likewise. 6 And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle, and said to them, ‘﻿Why have you been standing here idle all day?﻿’ 7 They said to him, ‘﻿Because no one hired us.﻿’ He said to them, ‘﻿You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right you will receive.﻿’  8 “﻿So when evening had come, the owner of the vineyard said to his steward, ‘﻿Call the laborers and give them their wages, beginning with the last to the first.﻿’ 9 And when those came who were hired about the eleventh hour, they each received a denarius. 10 But when the first came, they supposed that they would receive more; and they likewise received each a denarius. 11 And when they had received it, they complained against the landowner, 12 saying, ‘﻿These last men have worked only one hour, and you made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day.﻿’ 13 But he answered one of them and said, ‘﻿Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? 14 Take what is yours and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you. 15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things? Or is your eye evil because I am good?﻿’ 16 So the last will be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Matthew 18:21-35   Concerning Unlimited Forgiveness</span></em></strong></p>
<p>At this point Peter raised the question of how often he should forgive a brother who sinned against him. He probably thought he was showing unusual grace by suggesting seven as an outside limit. Jesus answered “not &#8230; seven times but up to seventy times seven.” He did not intend us to understand a literal 490 times; this was a figurative way of saying “Indefinitely.”  Someone might then ask, “Why bother to go through the steps outlined above? Why go to an offender alone, then with one or two others, then take him to church? Why not just forgive, and let that be the end of it?”   The answer is that there are stages in the administration of forgiveness, as follows:</p>
<p>1. When a brother wrongs me or sins against me, I should forgive him immediately in my heart (Eph. 4:32). That frees me from a bitter, unforgiving spirit, and leaves the matter on his shoulders.</p>
<p>2. While I have forgiven him in my heart, I do not yet tell him that he is forgiven. It would not be righteous to administer forgiveness publicly until he has repented. So I am obligated to go to him and rebuke him in love, hoping to lead him to confession (Luke 17:3).</p>
<p>3. As soon as he apologizes and confesses his sin, I tell him that he is forgiven (Luke 17:4).</p>
<p>Jesus then gives a parable of the kingdom of heaven to warn against the consequences of an unforgiving spirit by subjects who have been freely forgiven.   The story concerns a certain king who wanted to clear his bad debts off his books. One servant, who owed him ten thousand talents, was insolvent, so his lord ordered that he and his family be sold into slavery in payment of the debt. The distraught servant begged for time, promising to pay him all if given the chance.   Like many debtors, he was incredibly optimistic about what he could do if only he had time (v. 26). Galilee’s total revenue only amounted to 300 talents and this man owed 10,000! The detail about the vast amount is intentional. It is to shock the listeners and so capture their attention, and also to emphasize an immense debt to God. Martin Luther used to say that we are all beggars before Him; We cannot hope to pay.</p>
<p>When the master saw the contrite attitude of his servant, he forgave him the entire 10,000 talents. It was an epic display of grace, not justice.</p>
<p>Now that servant had a fellow servant who owed him one hundred denarii (a few hundred dollars). Rather than forgive him, he grabbed him by the throat and demanded payment in full. The hapless debtor pled for an extension, but it was no use. He was thrown into prison till he paid the debt—a difficult business at best, since his chance of earning money was gone as long as he was imprisoned.  The other servants, outraged by this inconsistent behavior, told their master. He was furious with the merciless lender. Having been forgiven a big debt, he was unwilling to forgive a pittance. So he was returned to the jailers’ custody till his debt was paid.</p>
<p>The application is clear. God is the King. All His servants had contracted a great debt of sin which they were unable to pay. In wonderful grace and compassion, the Lord paid the debt and granted full and free forgiveness. Now suppose some Christian wrongs another. When rebuked, he apologizes and asks forgiveness. But the offended believer refuses. He himself has been forgiven millions of dollars, but won’t forgive a few hundred. Will the King allow such behavior to go unpunished? Certainly not! The culprit will be chastened in this life and will suffer loss at the Judgment Seat of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 19:3-12   Concerning Marriage, Divorce and Celibacy</strong></p>
<p>Probably it was the multitudes that followed Him for healing that alerted the Pharisees to the Lord’s whereabouts. Like a pack of wild dogs, they began to close in, hoping to trap Him by His words. They asked if divorce was legal on any and every ground. No matter how He answered, He would infuriate some segment of the Jews. One school of thought took a very liberal attitude toward divorce; another was extremely strict.</p>
<p>Our Lord explained that God’s original intention was that a man have only one living wife. The God who created male and female decreed that the marriage relationship should supersede the parental relationship. He also said that marriage is a union of persons. God’s ideal is that this divinely ordained union should not be broken by human act or decree.   The Pharisees thought they had caught the Lord in a flagrant contradiction of the ﻿OT﻿. Hadn’t Moses made provision for divorce? A man could simply give his wife a written statement, then put her out of the house (Deut. 24:1–4).   Jesus agreed that Moses had permitted divorce, not as God’s best for mankind, but because of Israel’s backslidden condition: “Moses because of the hardness of your hearts permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.” God’s ideal was that there be no divorce. But God often tolerates conditions that are not His directive will.  Then the Lord stated with absolute authority that the past leniency on divorce was henceforth discontinued. Hereafter there would be only one valid ground for divorce—unchastity. If a person was divorced for any other reason and remarried, he was guilty of adultery.   Although not directly stated, it would seem from the words of our Lord that where a divorce has been obtained on the grounds of adultery, the innocent party is free to remarry. Otherwise divorce would serve no purpose not equally achieved by separation.   Sexual immorality, or fornication, is generally taken to mean adultery.  Later in the New Testament, the Apostle Paul adds the issue of abandonment as a valid reason for divorce, particularly if the abandonment is caused by the Christian witness of the innocent party.</p>
<p>When the disciples heard the Lord’s teaching on divorce, they proved themselves creatures of extremes by adopting the absurd position that if divorce is obtainable on only one ground, then to avoid sinning in the married state it would be better not to marry at all. But that would not save them from sinning in the single state.   So the Savior reminded them that the ability to remain celibate was not the general rule; only those to whom special grace was given could forego marriage. The dictum, “All cannot accept this saying, but only those to whom it has been given,” does not mean that all cannot understand what follows, but that they cannot live a continent life unless they are called to it.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus explained that there are three types of eunuchs. Some men are eunuchs because they were born without the power of reproduction. Others are so because they were castrated by men; oriental rulers often subjected the harem attendants to surgery to make them eunuchs. But Jesus especially had in mind those who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. These men could be married, and they have no physical impairment. Yet in dedication to the King and His kingdom, they willingly forego marriage in order to give themselves to the cause of Christ without distraction.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 19:16-20:16  Concerning Riches: The Rich Young Ruler </strong></p>
<p>A rich man intercepted the Lord with an apparently sincere inquiry. Addressing Jesus as “Good Teacher” he asked what he had to do to have eternal life. The question revealed his ignorance of the true identity of Jesus and of the way of salvation. He called Jesus “Teacher,” putting Him on the same level as other great men. And he spoke of gaining eternal life as a debt rather than as a gift.</p>
<p>Our Lord probed him on these two points. In asking, “Why do you call Me good? There is no one good but One, that is, God,” Jesus was not denying His own deity, but was providing the man with an opportunity to say, “That’s why I call You good—You are God.”   To test him on the way of salvation Jesus said, “But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” The Savior was not implying that man can be saved by keeping the commandments. Rather, He was using the law to produce conviction of sin in the man’s heart. The man was still under the delusion that he could inherit the kingdom on the principle of doing. Therefore, let him obey the law which told him what to do.   Our Lord quoted the five commandments dealing primarily with our fellow man, climaxing them by saying, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” Blind to his own selfishness, the man boasted that he had always kept these commandments.</p>
<p>Our Lord then exposed the man’s failure to love his neighbor as himself by telling him to sell all his possessions and give the money to the poor. Then he should come to Jesus and follow Him.  The Lord did not mean that this man could have been saved by selling his possessions and giving the proceeds to charity. There is only one way of salvation—faith in the Lord.  But in order to be saved, a man must acknowledge that he has sinned and fallen short of God’s holy requirements. The rich man’s unwillingness to share his possessions showed that he did not love his neighbor as himself. He should have said, “Lord, if that’s what is required, then I’m a sinner. I cannot save myself by my own efforts. Therefore, I ask You to save me by Your grace.” If he had responded to the Savior’s instruction he would have been given the way of salvation.  Instead, he went away sorrowful.</p>
<p>The rich man’s response prompted Jesus to observe that it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. Riches tend to become an idol. It is hard to have them without trusting in them. Our Lord declared that “it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” He was using a figure of speech known as hyperbole—a statement made in intensified form to produce a vivid, unforgettable effect.</p>
<p>It is clearly impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle! The “needle’s eye” has often been explained as the small door in a city gate. A camel could get through it by kneeling down, but only with great difficulty. However, the word used for “needle” in the parallel passage in Luke is the same word used to describe the needle used by surgeons. It seems clear from the context that the Lord was not speaking of difficulty, but of impossibility. Humanly speaking, a rich man simply cannot be saved.</p>
<p>The disciples were astonished by these remarks. As Jews living under the Mosaic code, by which God promised prosperity to those who obeyed Him, they correctly viewed riches as indicative of God’s blessing. If those who thus enjoyed God’s blessing couldn’t be saved, who could?   The Lord replied, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” Humanly speaking, it is impossible for anyone to be saved; only God can save a soul. But it is more difficult for a wealthy man to surrender his will to Christ than for a poor man, as evidenced by the fact that few rich men are converted. They find it almost impossible to replace trust in visible means of support for faith in an unseen Savior. Only God can effect such a change.</p>
<p>Peter caught the drift of the Savior’s teaching. Realizing that Jesus was saying, “Forsake all and follow Me,” Peter gloated that he and the other disciples had done exactly that; then he added, “What shall we have?” Peter’s self-life was showing, the old nature reasserting itself. It was a spirit each of us must guard against. He was bargaining with the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord assured Peter that everything done for Him would be rewarded handsomely. As to the twelve specifically, they would have places of authority in the Millennium. The regeneration refers to Christ’s future reign on earth; it is explained by the expression, “when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory.” We have previously referred to this phase of the kingdom as the kingdom in manifestation. At that time the twelve will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Rewards in the ﻿NT﻿ are closely linked with positions of administration in the Millennium (see Luke 19:17, 19). They are awarded at the Judgment Seat of Christ, but manifested when the Lord returns to earth to reign.</p>
<p>As to believers in general, Jesus added that all who have left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for His sake shall receive a hundredfold, and inherit eternal life. In this life, they enjoy a world-wide fellowship of believers that more than compensates for severed earthly ties. For the one house they leave, they receive a hundred Christian homes where they are warmly welcomed. For lands or other forms of wealth forsaken, they receive spiritual riches beyond reckoning.  The future reward for all believers is eternal life. This does not mean that we earn eternal life by forsaking all and sacrificing. Eternal life is a gift and cannot be earned or merited. Here the thought is that those who forsake all are rewarded with a greater capacity for enjoying eternal life in heaven. All believers will have that life but not all will enjoy it to the same extent.</p>
<p>The Lord closed His remarks with a warning against a bargaining spirit. He said to Peter, in effect, “Anything you do for My sake will be rewarded, but be careful that you are not guided by selfish considerations; because in that case, many who are first will be last, and the last first. This is illustrated by a parable in the next chapter. This statement may also have been a warning that it isn’t enough to start out well on the path of discipleship. It’s how we finish that counts.</p>
<p>Starting in 20:1, this parable is a continuation of the discourse on rewards at the end of chapter 19, illustrating the truth that while all true disciples will be rewarded, the order of rewards will be determined by the spirit in which the disciple served.</p>
<p>The parable describes a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers to work in his vineyard. These men contracted to work for a denarius a day, a reasonable wage at that time. Let us say they began to work at 6:00 a.m.</p>
<p>At 9:00 a.m. the farmer found some other unemployed laborers in the market place. In this case there was no labor-management agreement. They went to work with only his word that he would give them whatever was right.</p>
<p>At noon and at 3:00 p.m. the farmer hired more men on the basis that he would give them a fair wage. At 5:00 p.m. he found more unemployed men. They were not lazy; they wanted work but hadn’t been able to find it. So he sent them into the vineyard without any discussion of pay.  It is important to notice that the first men were hired as a result of a bargaining agreement; all the others left the matter of pay to the landowner.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the farmer instructed his paymaster to pay the men, beginning with the last hired and working back to the first. (In this way the earliest men hired saw what the others received.)   It was the same pay for all—one denarius. The 6:00 a.m. men thought they would receive more, but no—they too got one denarius. They were bitterly resentful; after all, they had worked longer and through the heat of the day.  In the farmer’s reply to one of them we find the abiding lessons from the parable. First he said, “Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what is yours, and go your way. I wish to give to this last man the same as to you.” The first bargained for a denarius a day and got the wage agreed on. The others cast themselves on the farmer’s grace and got grace. Grace is better than justice. It is better to leave our rewards up to the Lord than to strike a bargain with Him.</p>
<p>Then the farmer said, “Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with my own things?” The lesson, of course, is that God is sovereign. He can do as He pleases. And what He pleases will always be right, just, and fair. The farmer added, “Or is your eye evil because I am good?” This question exposes the selfish streak in human nature. The 6:00 a.m. men got exactly what they deserved, yet were jealous because the others got the same pay for working fewer hours. Many of us have to admit that it seems a bit unfair to us, too. This only proves that in the kingdom of heaven we must adopt an entirely new kind of thinking. We must abandon our greedy, competitive spirit, and think like the Lord.</p>
<p>Jesus closed the parable with the words, “So the last will be first, and the first last” (see 19:30). There will be surprises in the matter of rewards. Some who thought they would be first will be last because their service was inspired by pride and selfish ambition. Others who served out of love and gratitude will be highly honored.</p>
<p>Deeds of merit as we thought them, He will show us were but sin;  Little acts we had forgotten, He will show us were for Him. —Anon</p>
<h5>LESSON 14 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 20:17-28</strong></p>
<p>17 Now Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them, 18 “﻿Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death, 19 and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again.﻿”  20 Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons came to Him with her sons, kneeling down and asking something from Him.</p>
<p>21 And He said to her, “﻿What do you wish?﻿” She said to Him, “﻿Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the other on the left, in Your kingdom.﻿”  22 But Jesus answered and said, “﻿You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?﻿” They said to Him, “﻿We are able.﻿”</p>
<p>23 So He said to them, “﻿You will indeed drink My cup, and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on My right hand and on My left is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it is prepared by My Father.﻿”</p>
<p>24 And when the ten heard it, they were greatly displeased with the two brothers. 25 But Jesus called them to Himself and said, “﻿You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. 26 Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant. 27 And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave— 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 21:1-3</strong></p>
<p>1 Now when they drew near Jerusalem, and came to Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, 2 saying to them, “﻿Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Loose them and bring them to Me. 3 And if anyone says anything to you, you shall say, ‘﻿The Lord has need of them,﻿’ and immediately he will send them.﻿”  </p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Matthew 21:18-22</strong></span></em></p>
<p>18 Now in the morning, as He returned to the city, He was hungry. 19 And seeing a fig tree by the road, He came to it and found nothing on it but leaves, and said to it, “﻿Let no fruit grow on you ever again.﻿” Immediately the fig tree withered away.</p>
<p>20 And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, “﻿How did the fig tree wither away so soon?﻿” 21 So Jesus answered and said to them, “﻿Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, ‘﻿Be removed and be cast into the sea,﻿’ it will be done. 22 And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.﻿”</p>
<p><strong>Concerning His Death and Resurrection (20:17–28) </strong></p>
<p>It is apparent that the Lord was leaving for the trip to Jerusalem via Jericho. Once again He took the twelve disciples aside to explain what would happen after they reached the Holy City. He would be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes. He would be condemned to death by the leaders. Lacking authority to inflict capital punishment, they would turn Him over to the Gentiles (the Romans). He would be mocked, scourged, and crucified. But death would not keep its prey—He would rise again on the third day.</p>
<p>It is a sad commentary on human nature that, immediately after the third prediction of His passion, His followers were thinking more of their own glory than of His sufferings.   The mother of James and John came to the Lord asking that her boys might sit on either side of Him in His kingdom. It is to her credit that she wanted her sons near Jesus, and that she had not despaired of His coming reign. But she did not understand the principles upon which honors would be bestowed in the kingdom.   Jesus answered frankly that they did not understand what they were asking. They wanted a crown without a cross, a throne without the altar of sacrifice, the glory without the suffering that leads to it. So He asked them pointedly, “Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?” We are not left to wonder what He meant by the cup; He had just described it in verses 18 and 19. He must suffer and die.  James and John expressed ability to share in His sufferings, though perhaps their confidence was based more on zeal than knowledge.</p>
<p>Jesus assured them that they would indeed drink of His cup. James would be martyred and John persecuted and exiled to the Isle of Patmos.  Then Jesus explained that He could not arbitrarily grant places of honor in the kingdom; the Father had determined a special basis on which these positions would be assigned. They thought it was a matter of political patronage, that because they were so close to Christ, they had a special claim to places of preferment. But it was not a question of personal favoritism. In the counsels of God, the places on His right hand and left hand would be given on the basis of suffering for Him. This means that the chief honors in the kingdom are not limited to first century Christians; some living today might win them—by suffering.</p>
<p>The other ten disciples were greatly displeased that the sons of Zebedee had made such a request. They were probably indignant because they themselves wanted to be greatest and resented any prior claims being made by James and John!  This gave our Lord the opportunity to make a revolutionary statement concerning greatness in His kingdom. The Gentiles think of greatness in terms of mastery and rule. In Christ’s kingdom, greatness is manifested by service. Whoever aspires to greatness must become a servant, and whoever desires to be first must become a slave.  The Son of Man is the perfect example of lowly service. He came into the world not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many. The whole purpose of the Incarnation can be summed up in two words—serve and give. It is amazing to think that the exalted Lord humbled Himself to the manger and to the cross.  He gave His life a ransom for many. His death satisfied all God’s righteous demands against sin. It was sufficient to put away all the sins of all the world. But it is effective only for those who accept Him as Lord and Savior.</p>
<p> <strong>The Beginning Of The Triumphal Entry (21:1–3)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> </em></span></strong></p>
<p>On the way up from Jericho, Jesus came to the east side of the Mount of Olives where Bethany and Bethphage were located. From there the road skirted the south end of Olivet, dipped into the Valley of Jehoshaphat, crossed the Brook Kidron and climbed up to Jerusalem.  He sent two disciples to Bethany with the foreknowledge that they would find a tethered donkey, and a colt with her. They were to untie the animals and bring them to Jesus. If challenged, they were to explain that the Lord needed the beasts. Then the owner would consent.</p>
<p>The key to this passage is the prophecies given in the O.T..  Two different passages are fulfilled here:  Isaiah 62:11 and Zechariah 9:9. The former includes the lines,  “Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘See your salvation comes!</p>
<p>See, His reward is with Him, but His work lies ahead of Him.’ ”</p>
<p>The word for “salvation” here is “<em>yesha</em>,” identical with the name of the Messiah, Yeshua. Moreover, Isaiah describes this “<em>yesha</em> ” as a person, and not just any person, but God—since a person who <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span></em></strong> salvation must be God.</p>
<p>Zechariah 9:9 has these lines in it: “Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion! …</p>
<p>See, your king comes to you.  He is triumphant and victorious, humbly riding on a donkey, yes, on a colt, the offspring of a beast of burden.”</p>
<p>By combining the two verses Matthew gives a hint that God, the Salvation of Israel, the Messianic King and Yeshua of Nazareth are one. Also he hints at the two comings of the Messiah and the difference between them: at his first coming Yeshua is our final atoning sacrifice, bringing salvation by his death; therefore he rides into Jerusalem humbly on a beast of burden, ready to perform the work which lies ahead of him. But he will return, triumphant and victorious, as ruling king, rewarding the faithful—although for those who are faithful now, he has already begun to share the reward which he brings with him.</p>
<p><strong> The Barren Fig Tree (21:18–22) </strong></p>
<p>Returning to Jerusalem in the morning, the Lord came to a fig tree, hoping to find fruit on it to satisfy His hunger. Finding nothing on it but leaves, He said, “Let no fruit grow on you ever again.” Immediately the fig tree withered away.</p>
<p>Fig trees in Bible lands produced an early, edible fruit before the leaves appeared. This was a harbinger of the regular crop. If no early figs appeared, as in the case of this fig tree, it indicated that there would be no regular figs later on.  This is the only miracle in which Christ cursed rather than blessed—destroyed rather than restored life. This has been raised as a difficulty. Such criticism betrays an ignorance of the Person of Christ. He is God, the Sovereign of the universe. Some of His dealings are mysterious to us, but we must begin with the premise that they are always right. In this case, the Lord knew that the fig tree would never bear figs and He acted as a farmer would in removing a barren tree from his orchard.</p>
<p>When the disciples expressed amazement at the sudden withering of the tree, the Lord told them that they could do greater miracles than this if they had faith. For instance, they could say to a mountain, “Be removed and be cast into the sea,” and it would happen. “And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.”  Again, these seemingly unqualified promises concerning prayer must be understood in light of all that the Bible teaches on the subject. Verse 22 does not mean that any Christian can ask anything he wants and expect to get it. He must pray in accordance with the conditions laid down in the Bible.</p>
<h5>LESSON 15 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 21:23-45  </strong></p>
<p>23 Now when He came into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people confronted Him as He was teaching, and said, “﻿By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority?﻿”  24 But Jesus answered and said to them, “﻿I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I likewise will tell you by what authority I do these things: 25 The baptism of John—where was it from? From heaven or from men?﻿”  And they reasoned among themselves, saying, “﻿If we say, ‘﻿From heaven,﻿’ He will say to us, ‘﻿Why then did you not believe him?﻿’ 26 But if we say, ‘﻿From men,﻿’ we fear the multitude, for all count John as a prophet.﻿” 27 So they answered Jesus and said, “﻿We do not know.﻿”   And He said to them, “﻿Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.  28 “﻿But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, ‘﻿Son, go, work today in my vineyard.﻿’ 29 He answered and said, ‘﻿I will not,﻿’ but afterward he regretted it and went. 30 Then he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, ‘﻿I go, sir,﻿’ but he did not go. 31 Which of the two did the will of his father?﻿”</p>
<p>They said to Him, “﻿The first.﻿”  Jesus said to them, “﻿Assuredly, I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you. 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw it, you did not afterward relent and believe him.</p>
<p>33 “﻿Hear another parable: There was a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a winepress in it and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country. 34 Now when vintage-time drew near, he sent his servants to the vinedressers, that they might receive its fruit. 35 And the vinedressers took his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another. 36 Again he sent other servants, more than the first, and they did likewise to them. 37 Then last of all he sent his son to them, saying, ‘﻿They will respect my son.﻿’ 38 But when the vinedressers saw the son, they said among themselves, ‘﻿This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and seize his inheritance.﻿’ 39 So they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.  40 “﻿Therefore, when the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?﻿”  41 They said to Him, “﻿He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.﻿”  42 Jesus said to them, “﻿Have you never read in the Scriptures: ‘﻿The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone.</p>
<p>This was the Lord’s doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes’ ?  43 “﻿Therefore I say to you, the kingdom of God will be taken from you and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it. 44 And whoever falls on this stone will be broken; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder.﻿”  45 Now when the chief priests and Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking of them.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 22:1-14     </strong></p>
<p>1 And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said: 2 “﻿The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son, 3 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come. 4 Again, he sent out other servants, saying, ‘﻿Tell those who are invited, “﻿See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.﻿” ﻿’ 5 But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business. 6 And the rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them. 7 But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 8 Then he said to his servants, ‘﻿The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. 9 Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.﻿’ 10 So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.</p>
<p>11 “﻿But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment. 12 So he said to him, ‘﻿Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?﻿’ And he was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the servants, ‘﻿Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.﻿’  14 “﻿For many are called, but few are chosen.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 22:17-21</strong></p>
<p>17 Tell us, therefore, what do You think? Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?﻿”</p>
<p>18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, “﻿Why do you test Me, you hypocrites? 19 Show Me the tax money.﻿”  So they brought Him a denarius.</p>
<p>20 And He said to them, “﻿Whose image and inscription is this?﻿”</p>
<p>21 They said to Him, “﻿Caesar’s.﻿”  And He said to them, “﻿Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>Jesus’ Authority Questioned </strong></p>
<p>When Jesus came into the court outside the temple proper, the chief priests and the elders interrupted His teaching to ask who gave Him the authority to teach, to perform miracles, and to cleanse the temple. They hoped to trap Him, no matter how He answered. If He claimed to have authority in Himself as the Son of God, they would accuse Him of blasphemy. If He claimed authority from men, they would discredit Him. If He claimed authority from God, they would challenge Him.</p>
<p>The Lord offered to explain His authority if they would answer a question, “Was John’s baptism from heaven or from men?” John’s baptism should be understood as meaning John’s ministry. Therefore the question was, “Who authorized John to carry on his ministry? Was his ordination human or divine? What credentials did he hold from Israel’s leaders?” The answer was obvious: John was a man sent from God. His power came from divine appointment, not from human endorsement.</p>
<p>The priests and elders were in a dilemma. If they admitted that John was sent by God, they were trapped. John had pointed men to Jesus as the Messiah. If John’s authority was divine, why hadn’t they repented and believed on Christ?</p>
<p>On the other hand, if they said that John was not commissioned by God, they adopted a position that would be ridiculed by the people, most of whom agreed that John was a prophet from God. If they had correctly answered that John was divinely sent, they would have had the answer to their own question: Jesus was the Messiah of whom John had been the forerunner.   But they refused to face the facts, so they pleaded ignorance. They could not tell the source of John’s power. Then Jesus said, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.” Why should He tell them what they already knew but were unwilling to admit?</p>
<p><strong> Parable of the Two Sons (21:28–32) </strong></p>
<p>This parable is a stinging rebuke to the chief priests and elders for their failure to obey John’s call to repentance and faith. It concerns a man whose two sons were asked to work in the vineyard. One refused, then changed his mind and went. The other agreed to go, but never did.   When asked which son did the will of his father, the religious leaders unwittingly condemned themselves by saying, “The first.”</p>
<p>The Lord interpreted the parable. Tax collectors and harlots were like the first son. They made no immediate pretense of obeying John the Baptist, but eventually many of them did repent and believe in Jesus. The religious leaders were like the second son. They professed to approve the preaching of John, but never confessed their sins or trusted the Savior. Therefore the out-and-out sinners entered the kingdom of God while the self-satisfied religious leaders remained outside. It is the same today. Avowed sinners receive the gospel more readily than those with a veneer of false piety.</p>
<p> <strong>Parable of the Wicked Vinedressers (21:33–46) </strong></p>
<p>Further answering the question about authority, Jesus told the parable of a certain landowner who planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, installed a wine press in it, &#8230; built a tower, rented it to vinedressers, and went away to a distant country. At vintage-time &#8230; he sent his servants to the vinedressers to get his share of the crop, but the vinedressers beat one, killed one, and stoned another. When he sent other servants, they received the same treatment. The third time he sent his son, thinking they would respect him. Knowing full well that he was the heir, they killed him with the idea of seizing his inheritance.</p>
<p>At this point the Lord asked the priests and elders what the owner would do to those vinedressers. They answered, “He will destroy those wicked men miserably, and lease his vineyard to other vinedressers who will render to him the fruits in their seasons.”   The parable is not difficult to interpret. God is the landowner.  Repeatedly God sent His servants, the prophets, to the people of Israel seeking from the vineyard the fruits of fellowship, holiness, and love. But the people persecuted the prophets and killed some of them. Finally, God sent His Son, saying, “They will respect My Son” (v. 37). The chief priests and scribes said, “This is the heir”—a fatal admission. They privately agreed that Jesus was the Son of God (though publicly denying it) and thus answered their own question concerning His authority. His authority came from the fact that He was God the Son.</p>
<p>When the Savior asked what the owner of the vineyard would do, their answer condemned them, as He shows in verses 42 and 43. He quoted the words of Psalm 118:22: “The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.” When Christ, the Stone, presented Himself to the builders—the leaders of Israel, they had no place for Him in their building plans. They threw Him aside as useless. But following His death He was raised from the dead and given the place of preeminence by God. He has been made the topmost stone in God’s building: “God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name &#8230; ” (Phil. 2:9).</p>
<p>Jesus then bluntly announced that the kingdom of God would be taken from “religious” Israel and given to a “nation” bearing the fruits of repentance and faith.  The prophecy that the kingdom of God would be given to a nation bearing the fruits of it has been understood as referring to the church, composed of believing Jews and Gentiles—“a holy nation, God’s own people” (1 Pet. 2:9).</p>
<p>The chief priests and Pharisees realized these parables were aimed directly at them, in answer to their question concerning Christ’s authority. They would like to have seized Him then and there, but they feared the multitudes, who still took Jesus for a prophet.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the Wedding Dinner (22:1–14) </strong></p>
<p>Jesus was not through with the chief priests and Pharisees. In a parable of a wedding dinner He likened the kingdom of heaven to a certain king who arranged a marriage feast for his son. The invitation was in two stages. First, an advance invitation, personally conveyed by servants, which met a flat refusal. The second invitation announced that the feast was spread. It was treated contemptuously by some, who were too busy with their farms and businesses, and violently by others, who seized, abused, and killed the servants.</p>
<p>The king was so furious that he destroyed those murderers and burned their city. Scrapping the first guest list, he issued a general invitation to all who would come. This time there wasn’t an empty seat in the wedding hall.  Among the guests, however, was one who did not have a wedding garment. Challenged on his unfitness to attend, he was speechless. The king ordered him to be cast out into the night, where there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth.  Our Lord concluded the parable with the words, “For many are called, but few are chosen.”</p>
<p>As to the meaning of the parable, the king is God and His Son is the Lord Jesus. The wedding feast is an appropriate description of the festive joy which characterizes the kingdom of heaven.  The first stage of the invitation pictures John the Baptist and the twelve disciples graciously inviting Israel to the wedding feast. But the nation refused to accept. The words, “they were not willing to come” (v. 3), were climactically dramatized in the crucifixion.</p>
<p>The second stage of the invitation suggests the proclamation of the gospel to the world, both Jew and Gentile,  in the book of Acts. Some treated the message with contempt. Some treated the messengers with violence; most of the apostles were martyred.</p>
<p>The man without a wedding garment is one who professes to be ready for the kingdom but who has never been clothed in the righteousness of God through the Lord Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 5:21). Actually there was (and is) no excuse for the man without the wedding garment. As a famous commentator named Ryrie notes, it was the custom in those days to provide the guests with a garment if they had none. The man obviously did not take advantage of the offered provision. Without Christ, he is speechless when challenged as to his right to enter the kingdom (Rom. 3:19). His doom is outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. The weeping suggests the suffering of hell.</p>
<p>Verse 14 refers to the whole parable and not just to the incident of the man without the wedding garment. Many are called, that is, the gospel invitation goes out to many. But few are chosen. Some refuse the invitation, and even of those who respond favorably, some are exposed as false professors. All who respond to the good news are chosen. The only way a person can tell whether he is chosen is by what he does with the Lord Jesus Christ. As Jennings put it, “All are called to enjoy the feast, but not all are willing to trust the Giver to provide the robe that fits for the feast.”</p>
<p><strong>Another attempt to trap Jesus (22:17-21)</strong></p>
<p>Here we have an attempt by the Pharisees and Herodians to trap Jesus with His words. These two parties were bitter foes temporarily brought together by a common hatred of the Savior. Their goal was to lure Christ into making a political statement with dangerous implications. They took advantage of the Jews’ division over allegiance to Caesar. Some passionately opposed submitting to the Gentile emperor. Others, like the Herodians, adopted a more tolerant view.</p>
<p>They dropped a loaded question, “Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”</p>
<p>If Jesus answered, “No,” He would not only antagonize the Herodians, but would be accused of rebellion against the Roman government. The Pharisees would have hustled Him off and pressed charges against Him. If He said, “Yes,” He would run afoul of the Jews’ intense nationalistic spirit. He would lose much support among the common people—support which so far hindered the leaders in their efforts to dispose of Him.</p>
<p>Jesus bluntly denounced them as hypocrites, trying to trap Him. Then He asked them to show Him a denarius, the coin used to pay taxes to the Roman government. Every time the Jews saw the likeness and title of Caesar on the coin it was an annoying reminder that they were under Gentile authority and taxation.  Jesus asked them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” They were forced to answer, “Caesar’s.” Then the Lord told them, “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</p>
<p>The question had boomeranged. They had hoped to trap Jesus on the question of tribute to Caesar. He exposed their failure to give tribute to God. Galling as it was, they did give Caesar his due, but they had disregarded the claims of God on their lives. And One stood before them who is the express image of God’s Person (Heb. 1:3) and they failed to give Him His rightful place.</p>
<p>Jesus’ reply shows that the believer has dual citizenship. He is responsible to obey and support human government, as long as it does not conflict with God’s will. He is to pray for those in authority. As a citizen of heaven, he is responsible to obey God. If there is ever a conflict between the two, his first loyalty is to God (Acts 5:29).</p>
<p>In quoting verse 21, most of us emphasize the part about Caesar and skip lightly over the part about God—exactly the fault for which Jesus repremanded the Pharisees!</p>
<h5>LESSON 16 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 23</strong></p>
<p>1 Then Jesus spoke to the multitudes and to His disciples, 2 saying: “﻿The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat. 3 Therefore whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do. 4 For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers. 5 But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments. 6 They love the best places at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues, 7 greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called by men, ‘﻿Rabbi, Rabbi.﻿’ 8 But you, do not be called ‘﻿Rabbi﻿’; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren. 9 Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. 10 And do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ. 11 But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. 12 And whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.</p>
<p>13 “﻿But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men; for you neither go in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in. 14 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. Therefore you will receive greater condemnation.</p>
<p>15 “﻿Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel land and sea to win one proselyte, and when he is won, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.  16 “﻿Woe to you, blind guides, who say, ‘﻿Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obliged to perform it.﻿’ 17 Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold? 18 And, ‘﻿Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing; but whoever swears by the gift that is on it, he is obliged to perform it.﻿’ 19 Fools and blind! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift? 20 Therefore he who swears by the altar, swears by it and by all things on it. 21 He who swears by the temple, swears by it and by Him who dwells in it. 22 And he who swears by heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him who sits on it.</p>
<p>23 “﻿Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faith. These you ought to have done, without leaving the others undone. 24 Blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!</p>
<p>25 “﻿Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. 26 Blind Pharisee, first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that the outside of them may be clean also.</p>
<p>27 “﻿Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. 28 Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.  29 “﻿Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Because you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous, 30 and say, ‘﻿If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.﻿’</p>
<p>31 “﻿Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. 32 Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers’ guilt. 33 Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell? 34 Therefore, indeed, I send you prophets, wise men, and scribes: some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, 35 that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar. 36 Assuredly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.</p>
<p>37 “﻿O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing! 38 See! Your house is left to you desolate; 39 for I say to you, you shall see Me no more till you say, ‘﻿Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!﻿’ ﻿”</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Warning Against High Talk, Low Walk (23:1–12) </strong></p>
<p>In the opening verses of this chapter, the Savior warns the crowds and His disciples against the scribes and the Pharisees. These leaders sat in Moses’ seat, or taught the Law of Moses.  “The particular place in the synagogue where the leaders used to sit was known metaphorically as the seat of Moses or as the throne of the Law, symbolizing the succession of teachers down through the ages.” (William G. Braude and Israel J. Kapstein, 1975)   A third-century AD  “Chair of Moses” from Korazin is on display at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem;  they can also be found in Hamot, Tiberias and Delos (Greece).   See the notes on “BINDING &amp; LOOSING” from a previous lesson in this series.</p>
<p>Generally, their teachings were dependable, but their practice was not. Their creed was better than their conduct. It was a case of high talk and low walk. So Jesus said, “&#8230; whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do.”  They made heavy demands (probably extreme interpretations of the letter of the law) on the people, but would not assist anyone in lifting these intolerable loads.</p>
<p>They went through religious observances to be seen by men, not from inward sincerity. Their use of phylacteries was an example. In commanding Israel to bind His words as a sign upon their hands and as frontlets between their eyes (Ex. 13:9, 16; Deut. 6:8; 11:18), God meant that the law should continually be before them, guiding their activities. They reduced this spiritual command to a literal, physical sense. Enclosing portions of Scripture in leather capsules, they bound them to their foreheads or arms. They weren’t concerned about obeying the law as long as, by wearing ridiculously large phylacteries, they appeared super-spiritual. The law also commanded the Jews to wear tassels with blue cords on the corners of their garments, (Num. 15:37–41; Deut. 22:12). These distinctive trimmings were intended to remind them that they were a distinct people, and that they should walk in separation from the nations. The Pharisees overlooked the spiritual lesson and satisfied themselves with making longer fringes.   They showed their self-importance by scrambling for the places of honor at feasts and in the synagogues. They nourished their ego on greetings in the marketplaces and especially enjoyed being called rabbi (meaning “my great one,” or “teacher”).   Here the Lord warned His disciples against using distinctive titles which should be reserved for the Godhead. We are not to be called rabbi as a distinctive title because there is one Teacher—the Christ. We should call no man father; God is our Father.</p>
<p><strong>Woes against the Scribes and Pharisees (23:13–36) </strong></p>
<p>The Lord Jesus next pronounces eight woes on the proud religious hypocrites of His day. These are not “curses,” but rather expressions of sorrow at their fate, not unlike the expression, “Alas for you!”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1) obduracy and obstructionism.</span> They refused to enter the kingdom themselves, and aggressively hindered others from entering. Strangely, religious leaders are often the most active opponents of the gospel of grace. They can be sweetly tolerant of everything but the good news of salvation. Natural man doesn’t want to be the object of God’s grace and doesn’t want God to show grace to others.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2) appropriating of widow’s houses and covering it up by making long prayers.</span> Some modern cults use a similar technique by getting elderly widows, sometimes undiscerning believers, to sign over their property to the “church.” Such pretenders to piety will receive greater condemnation.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3) misdirected zeal.</span> They went to unimaginable lengths to make one convert, but after he was won they made him twice as wicked as themselves. A modern analogy is the zeal of false cults. One group is willing to knock on 700 doors to reach one person for their cause; but the final result is evil. As someone has said, “The most converted often become the most perverted.”</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4) deliberate dishonest reasoning.</span> They had built up a false system of reasoning to evade the payment of vows. For instance, they taught that if you swore by the temple, you were not obligated to pay, but if you swore by the gold of the temple, then you must perform the vow. They said that swearing by the gift on the altar was binding, whereas swearing by the empty altar was not. Thus they valued gold above God (the temple was the house of God), and the gift on the altar (wealth of some form) above the altar itself. They were more interested in the material than the spiritual. They were more interested in getting (the gift) than in giving (the altar was the place of giving).</p>
<p>          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">5) ritualism without reality.</span> The scribes and Pharisees were meticulous in             </p>
<p>         giving the Lord a tenth of the most insignificant herbs they raised. Jesus        </p>
<p>         did not condemn them for this care in small details of obedience, but He        </p>
<p>         charged them for being utterly unscrupulous when it came to showing         </p>
<p>         justice, mercy, and faithfulness to others.</p>
<p>          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">6) externalism.</span> The Pharisees, careful to maintain an outward show of          </p>
<p>         religiousness and morality, had hearts filled with extortion and self–        </p>
<p>         indulgence. They should first cleanse the inside of the cup and dish, that         </p>
<p>         is, make sure their hearts were cleansed through repentance and faith.           </p>
<p>        Then, and only then, would their outward behavior be acceptable.</p>
<p>          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">7) The seventh woe also strikes out against externalism.</span> The difference is          </p>
<p>         that the sixth woe is against the concealment of avarice, but the seventh         </p>
<p>         condemns the concealment of hypocrisy and lawlessness.   Tombs were         </p>
<p>         whitewashed so that Jewish people would not inadvertently touch them        </p>
<p>         and thus be ceremonially defiled. Jesus likened the scribes and Pharisees    </p>
<p>         to whitewashed tombs, which looked clean on the outside but were full of          </p>
<p>         corruption inside.</p>
<p>          <span style="text-decoration: underline;">8) outward homage, inward homicide.</span> The scribes and Pharisees          </p>
<p>         pretended to honor the ﻿OT﻿ prophets by building and/or repairing their         </p>
<p>         tombs and putting wreaths on their monuments. In memorial speeches,         </p>
<p>         they said they would not have joined their ancestors in killing the prophets.</p>
<p>         Jesus said to them, “Therefore you are witnesses against yourselves that        </p>
<p>         you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.” But how did they           </p>
<p>         witness this? It almost seems from the preceding verse that they          </p>
<p>         dissociated themselves from their fathers who killed the prophets. First,             </p>
<p>         they admitted that their fathers, of whom they were physical sons, shed          </p>
<p>         the blood of the prophets. But Jesus used the word sons in the sense of       </p>
<p>         meaning people with the same characteristics. He knew that even as they              </p>
<p>         were decorating the prophets’ graves, they were plotting His death.           </p>
<p>         Second, in showing such respect for the dead prophets, they were saying,          </p>
<p>         “The only prophets we like are dead ones.” In this sense also they were            </p>
<p>         sons of their fathers.</p>
<p>At this point the Messiah, the Son of God utters the thunderous words, “Serpents, brood of vipers! How can you escape the condemnation of hell?” Can Incarnate Love speak such scathing words? Yes, because true love must also be righteous and holy. The popular conception of Jesus as an innocuous reformer, capable of no emotion but love, is unbiblical. Love can be firm, and must always be just.   It is solemn to remember that these words of condemnation were hurled at religious leaders, not at drunkards and reprobates. In an ecumenical age when some evangelical Christians are joining forces with avowed enemies of the cross of Christ, it is good to ponder the example of Jesus, and to remember the words of Jehu to Jehoshaphat, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord?” (2 Chron. 19:2).</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Laments Over Jerusalem (23:37–39) </strong></p>
<p>It is highly significant that the chapter which, more than almost any other, contains some of the harshest words of the Lord Jesus, closes with His tears! After His bitter denunciation of the Pharisees, He utters a poignant lament over the city of lost opportunity. The repetition of the name—“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem”—is charged with unutterable emotion. She had killed the prophets and stoned God’s messengers, yet the Lord loved her, and would often have protectingly and lovingly gathered her children to Himself—as a hen gathers her chicks—but she was not willing.</p>
<p>Verse 39 looks forward to the Second Advent when a believing portion of Israel will accept Him as their Messiah-King. This acceptance is implicit in the words, “Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.”   The next time the inhabitants of Jerusalem would see Him after His death would be when they would look on Him whom they pierced and mourn for Him as one mourns for an only son (Zech. 12:10). In Jewish reckoning there is no mourning as bitter as that for an only son.</p>
<h5>LESSON 17 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 24 (NKJV)</strong></p>
<p>1 Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. 2 And Jesus said to them, “﻿Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.﻿”  3 Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “﻿Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?﻿”</p>
<p>4 And Jesus answered and said to them: “﻿Take heed that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in My name, saying, ‘﻿I am the Christ,﻿’ and will deceive many. 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.</p>
<p>9 “﻿Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. 10 And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. 11 Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. 12 And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But he who endures to the end shall be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>15 “﻿Therefore when you see the ‘﻿abomination of desolation,﻿’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place﻿” (whoever reads, let him understand), 16 “﻿then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. 18 And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. 19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 20 And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. 22 And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened.  23 “﻿Then if anyone says to you, ‘﻿Look, here is the Christ!﻿’ or ‘﻿There!﻿’ do not believe it. 24 For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you beforehand.</p>
<p>26 “﻿Therefore if they say to you, ‘﻿Look, He is in the desert!﻿’ do not go out; or ‘﻿Look, He is in the inner rooms!﻿’ do not believe it.  27 For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 28 For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>29 “﻿Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>32 “﻿Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. 33 So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors! 34 Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.  36 “﻿But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. 37 But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 40 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. 42 Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. 44 Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.  45 “﻿Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season? 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. 47 Assuredly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his goods. 48 But if that evil servant says in his heart, ‘﻿My master is delaying his coming,﻿’ 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards, 50 the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour that he is not aware of, 51 and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Predicts the Destruction of the Temple (24:1, 2) </strong></p>
<p>The discourse is introduced by the significant statement that Jesus went out and departed from the temple This movement is especially significant in view of the words He had just uttered, “ &#8230; your house is left to you desolate” (23:38). It reminds us of Ezekiel’s description of the glory departing from the temple (Ezek. 9:3; 10:4; 11:23).   The disciples wanted the Lord to admire the architectural beauty of the temple with them. They were occupied with the temporary instead of the eternal, concerned with shadows rather than substance. Jesus warned that the building would be so completely destroyed that not one stone would be left on top of another. Titus tried unsuccessfully to save the temple, but his soldiers put it to the torch, thus fulfilling Christ’s prophecy. When the fire melted the gold trim, the molten metal ran down between the stones. To get at it, the soldiers had to remove the stones one by one, just as our Lord predicted. This judgment was executed in a.d. 70 when the Romans under Titus sacked Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>The First Half of the Tribulation (24:3–14) </strong></p>
<p>24:3 After Jesus had crossed over to the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately and asked Him three questions:</p>
<p>1. When would these things happen; that is, when would the temple be destroyed?</p>
<p>2. What would be the sign of His coming; that is, what supernatural event would precede His return to the earth to set up His kingdom?</p>
<p>3. What would be the sign of the end of the age; that is, what would announce the end of the age immediately prior to His glorious reign? (The second and third questions are essentially the same.)</p>
<p>We should be clear that they were not talking about the end of the world (as in the ﻿KJV﻿), but the end of the age (﻿Gk.﻿, aiōn).</p>
<p>Their first question is not answered directly. Rather the Savior seems to merge the siege of Jerusalem in a.d. 70 (see Luke 21:20–24) with a similar siege that will occur in the latter days. In the study of prophecy, we often see the Lord moving almost imperceptibly from an early, partial fulfillment to a later, final fulfillment.   The second and third questions are answered in verses 4–44 of chapter 24. These verses describe the seven year period known as Daniel’s Seventieth Week, which will precede Christ’s Second Advent. The first three and one-half years are described in verses 4–14. The final three and one-half years, known as the Great Tribulation and the Time of Jacob’s Trouble (Jer. 30:7), will be a time of unprecedented suffering for those on earth.</p>
<p>Many of the conditions characterizing the first half of the Tribulation have existed to an extent throughout human history, but will appear in greatly intensified form during the period under discussion. Those in the church have been promised tribulation (John 16:33).  During the first half of the Tribulation, many false messiahs will appear who will succeed in deceiving multitudes. The current rise of many false cults may be a prelude to this, but it is not a fulfillment.  Many of these false religious leaders will claim to be the Christ.</p>
<p>There will be wars and rumors of wars. Nation (ethnos) will rise against nation (ethnos) (signifying what we now call “ethnic cleansing”), and kingdom (political entity) against kingdom (political entity).  We are currently seeing the establishment of this pattern in the world today as a prelude to what is to come.</p>
<p>Famines, pestilences, and earthquakes will occur in various parts of the earth. Even today world leaders are alarmed by the specter of famine due to the population explosion. But this will be accentuated by the shortages caused by wars.  Earthquakes are attracting increasing attention—not only those now occurring but also those that are expected.  Verse 8 clearly identifies this period as the beginning of sorrows—the onset of birth-pangs which will bring forth a new order under Christ as He establishes His 1,000 year Reign on this earth.</p>
<p>Faithful believers will experience great personal testing during the Tribulation. The nations will conduct a bitter hate campaign against all who are true to Him. Not only will they be tried in religious and civil courts (Mark 13:9), but many will be martyred because they refuse to recant. While such testings have occured during all periods of Christian testimony, they will intensify and be more wide-spread this period.  Many will apostatize rather than suffer and die. Family members will inform against their own relatives and betray them into the hands of bestial persecutors.</p>
<p>Many false prophets will appear and deceive hordes of people. These are not to be confused with the false messiahs of verse 5. False prophets claim to be spokesmen for God. They can be detected in two ways: their prophecies do not always come to pass, and their teachings always lead men away from the true God.</p>
<p>With wickedness rampaging, human affections will be less and less evident. Acts of unlove will be commonplace.  “But he who endures to the end shall be saved.” This obviously does not mean that men’s souls will be saved at that time by their enduring; salvation is always presented in the Bible as a gift of God’s grace, received by faith in Christ’s substitutionary death and resurrection. Neither can it mean that all who endure will escape physical harm; we have already learned that many believers will be martyred (v. 9). It is a general statement that those who stand fast, enduring persecution without apostatizing, will be delivered at Christ’s Second Advent. No one should imagine that apostasy will be a means of escape or safety. Only those who have true faith shall be saved. Although saving faith may have lapses, it always has the quality of permanence.   During this period, the gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed worldwide, as a witness to all nations. </p>
<p>There is a striking parallel between the events listed in verses 3–14 and those of Revelation 6:1–11. The rider on the white horse—false messiah; the rider of the red horse—war; the rider of the black horse—famine; the rider of the pale horse—pestilence or death. The souls under the altar are martyrs. The events described in Revelation 6:12–17 are linked with those in Matthew 24:19–31.</p>
<p><strong> The Great Tribulation (24:15–28) </strong></p>
<p>At this point we have come to the middle of the Tribulation. We know this by comparing verse 15 with Daniel 9:27. Daniel predicted that in the middle of the seventieth week, that is, at the end of three and a half years, an idolatrous image would be set up in the holy place, i.e., the temple in Jerusalem. All men will be ordered to worship this abominable idol. Failure to comply will be punishable by death (Rev. 13:15).   “Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place” (whoever reads, let him understand). &#8230; The erection of the idol will be the signal to those who know the Word of God that the Great Tribulation has begun. Note that the Lord wants the one who reads the prophecy to understand it.</p>
<p>Those who are in Judea should flee to the mountains; in the vicinity of Jerusalem their refusal to bow to the image would be quickly detected.  Utmost haste will be necessary. If a man is sitting on the housetop, he should leave all his possessions behind. Time spent in gathering belongings might mean the difference between life and death. The man working in the field should not return for his clothes, wherever he may have left them. Pregnant women and nursing mothers will be at a distinct disadvantage—it will be hard for them to make a speedy escape.  Believers should pray that the crisis will not come in winter with its added travel hazards.  “For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be.” This description isolates the period from all the inquisitions, pogroms, purges, massacres, and genocides of history. This prophecy could not have been fulfilled by any previous persecutions because it is clearly stated that it will be ended by the Second Advent of Christ.</p>
<p>The tribulation will be so intense that unless those days were shortened, nobody would survive.  If God allowed it to continue past the three and a half year point, no Human being would survive.  God, in His perfect timing knows exactly how long it will take to achieve the desired result, and will  not allow it to last one minute longer than that.</p>
<p>Verses 23 and 24 contain renewed warnings against false messiahs and false prophets. In an atmosphere of crisis, reports will circulate that the Messiah is in some secret location. Such reports could be used to trap those who sincerely and lovingly look for Christ. So the Lord warns all disciples not to believe reports of a secret Advent. Even those who perform miracles are not necessarily from God; miracles can be satanic in origin. The Man of Sin will be given satanic power to perform miracles (2 Thess. 2:9, 10).</p>
<p>Christ’s Advent will be un mistakable—it will be sudden, public, universal, and glorious. Like the lightning, it will be instantly and clearly visible to all.</p>
<p><strong>The Second Advent (24:29–31) </strong></p>
<p>At the close of the Great Tribulation there will be terrifying disturbances in the heavens. The sun will be darkened, and since the moon’s light is only a reflection of the sun’s, the moon will also withhold its light. The stars will plunge from heaven and planets will be moved out of their orbits. Needless to say, such vast cosmic upheavals will affect the weather, tides, and seasons on earth.</p>
<p>A faint idea of what it will be like is given in Velikovsky’s description of what would happen if a heavenly body came close to the earth and caused it to tilt on its axis:</p>
<p> “At that moment an earthquake would make the earth shudder. Air and water would continue to move through inertia; hurricanes would sweep the earth and the seas would rush over continents, carrying gravel and sand and marine animals, and casting them on the land. Heat would be developed, rocks would melt, volcanoes would erupt, lava would flow from fissures in the ruptured ground and cover vast areas. Mountains would spring up from the plains and would travel and climb on the shoulders of other mountains, causing faults and rifts. Lakes would be tilted and emptied, rivers would change their beds; large land areas with all their inhabitants would slip under the sea. Forests would burn and the hurricane and wild seas would wrest them from the ground on which they grew and pile them, branch and root, in huge heaps. Seas would turn into deserts, their waters flowing away.”</p>
<p>“Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven.” We are not told what this sign will be. His First Advent was accompanied by a sign in heaven—the star. Perhaps a miracle star will also announce His Second Coming. Some believe the Son of Man is Himself the sign. Whatever is meant, it will be clear to all when it appears. All the tribes of the earth will mourn—no doubt because of their rejection of Him.  Then “they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.” What a wonderful moment! The One who was spit upon and crucified will be vindicated as the Lord of life and glory. The meek and lowly Jesus will appear as Jehovah Himself. The sacrificial Lamb will descend as the conquering Lion. The despised Carpenter of Nazareth will come as King of kings and Lord of lords. His chariots will be the clouds of heaven. He will come in regal power and splendor—the moment for which creation has groaned for thousands of years.  </p>
<p>Notice that in a literal translation (Young’s) of verse 31, the believers will be gathered from the HEAVENS (plural), rather than from HEAVEN (singular), indicating that there are Christians living on the earth at that time.  </p>
<p><em>29`And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken;  </em></p>
<p><em>30 and then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth smite the breast, and they shall see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of the heaven, with power and much glory;</em></p>
<p><em>31 and he shall send his messengers with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens unto the ends thereof.</em>   </p>
<p>When He descends, He will send His angels throughout the earth to gather together His elect people. From all the earth they will gather to greet their Messiah and to enjoy His glorious reign.</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Fig Tree (24:32–35) </strong></p>
<p>“Now learn this parable from the fig tree.” Again our Lord draws a spiritual lesson from nature. When the branches of the fig tree become green and tender, you know that summer is near. We have seen that the fig tree pictures the nation of Israel (21:18–22). For hundreds of years Israel has been dormant, with no government of its own, no land, no temple, no priesthood—no sign of national life. The people have been scattered throughout the world.  Then, in 1948, Israel became a nation with its own land, government, currency, stamps, etc. Spiritually, the nation is still barren and cold; there is no fruit for God. But nationally, we might say that its branches are green and tender.  “So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the very doors!” Israel’s emergence as a nation means not only that the beginning of the Seventieth Week of Daniel is near, but that the Lord Himself is near, at the very doors!</p>
<p>After referring to the fig tree, Jesus added, “Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place.” “This generation” could not mean the people living when Christ was on earth; they have all passed away, yet the events of chapter 24 have not taken place. What then did our Lord mean by “this generation”?  I firmly believe the thought is: “the very generation that sees the beginning of these things will see the end.” The same generation (era) of people who see the rise of Israel as a nation will see the Lord Jesus coming in the clouds of heaven to reign.</p>
<p>To emphasize the unfailing character of His predictions, Jesus added that heaven and earth would pass away but His words would by no means pass away. In speaking of heaven passing away, He was referring to the stellar and atmospheric heavens, not to that heaven which is the dwelling place of God (2 Cor. 12:2–4). The dissolution of the heaven and the earth is described in 2 Peter 3:10–13 and mentioned again in Revelation 20:11.</p>
<p><strong>The Day and Hour Unknown (24:36–44) </strong></p>
<p>As to the exact day and hour of His Second Advent, “no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only.” This should warn against the temptation to set dates or to believe those who do. We are not surprised that angels do not know; they are finite creatures with limited knowledge.</p>
<p>While those living prior to Christ’s return will not know its day or hour, it seems that those familiar with the prophecy may be able to know the year. They will know, for instance, that it will be approximately three and one-half years after the idol image is set up in the temple (Dan. 9:27; see also Dan. 7:25; 12:7, 11; Rev. 11:2, 3; 12:14; 13:5).   In those days, however, most people will be indifferent, just as in the days of Noah. Although the days before the flood were terribly wicked, that is not the feature emphasized here. The people ate, drank, married, gave in marriage; in other words, they went through the routines of life as if they were going to live forever. Though warned that a flood was coming, they lived as if they were flood-proof. When it came, they were unprepared, outside the only place of safety. That is just the way it will be when Christ returns. Only those who are in Christ, the ark of safety, will be delivered.</p>
<p> Two men will be in the field; one will be taken away in judgment, the other will be left to enter the Millennium. Two women will be grinding at the mill; they will be instantly separated. One will be swept away by the flood of judgment; the other left to enjoy the blessings of Christ’s reign.  In view of the uncertainty as to the day and the hour, men ought to watch. If someone knows his house is going to be broken into, he will be ready, even if he doesn’t know the exact time. The Son of Man will come when least expected by the masses. Therefore, His people should be on the tiptoes of expectancy.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the Wise and the Evil Servants (24:45–51) </strong></p>
<p>In the closing section of this chapter, the Lord Jesus shows that a servant manifests his true character by how he behaves in view of his Master’s return. All servants are supposed to feed the household at the proper time. But not all who profess to be Christ’s servants are genuine.   The wise servant is the one who is found caring for God’s people. Such a one will be honored with vast responsibility in the kingdom. The master will make him ruler over all his goods.</p>
<p>The evil servant represents a nominal believer whose behavior is not affected by the prospect of his Master’s soon return. He begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards. Such behavior demonstrates that he is not ready for the kingdom. When the King comes, He will punish him and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, where people weep and gnash their teeth.</p>
<h5>LESSON 18 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 25</strong></p>
<p>1 “﻿Then the kingdom of heaven shall be likened to ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Now five of them were wise, and five were foolish. 3 Those who were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them, 4 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 5 But while the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept. 6 “﻿And at midnight a cry was heard: ‘﻿Behold, the bridegroom is coming; go out to meet him!﻿’ 7 Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. 8 And the foolish said to the wise, ‘﻿Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.﻿’ 9 But the wise answered, saying, ‘﻿No, lest there should not be enough for us and you; but go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.﻿’ 10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding; and the door was shut. 11 “﻿Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, ‘﻿Lord, Lord, open to us!﻿’ 12 But he answered and said, ‘﻿Assuredly, I say to you, I do not know you.﻿’ 13 “﻿Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</p>
<p>14 “﻿For the kingdom of heaven is like a man traveling to a far country, who called his own servants and delivered his goods to them. 15 And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability; and immediately he went on a journey. 16 Then he who had received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents. 17 And likewise he who had received two gained two more also. 18 But he who had received one went and dug in the ground, and hid his lord’s money. 19 After a long time the lord of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 20 “﻿So he who had received five talents came and brought five other talents, saying, ‘﻿Lord, you delivered to me five talents; look, I have gained five more talents besides them.﻿’ 21 His lord said to him, ‘﻿Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.﻿’ 22 He also who had received two talents came and said, ‘﻿Lord, you delivered to me two talents; look, I have gained two more talents besides them.﻿’ 23 His lord said to him, ‘﻿Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.﻿’</p>
<p>24 “﻿Then he who had received the one talent came and said, ‘﻿Lord, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not scattered seed. 25 And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the ground. Look, there you have what is yours.﻿’ 26 “﻿But his lord answered and said to him, ‘﻿You wicked and lazy servant, you knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered seed. 27 So you ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest. 28 So take the talent from him, and give it to him who has ten talents.</p>
<p>29 ‘﻿For to everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away. 30 And cast the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.﻿</p>
<p>31 “﻿When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory. 32 All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats. 33 And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. 34 Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘﻿Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world: 35 for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; 36 I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.﻿’ 37 “﻿Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘﻿Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? 38 When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? 39 Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?﻿’ 40 And the King will answer and say to them, ‘﻿Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.﻿’  41 “﻿Then He will also say to those on the left hand, ‘﻿Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: 42 for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; 43 I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.﻿’ 44 “﻿Then they also will answer Him, saying, ‘﻿Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?﻿’ 45 Then He will answer them, saying, ‘﻿Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.﻿’ 46 And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.﻿”</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the Ten Virgins (25:1–13) </strong></p>
<p>The first word, “Then”, referring back to chapter 24, clearly places this parable in the time preceding and during the King’s return to earth. Jesus likens the kingdom of heaven at that time to ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were wise and had oil for their lamps; the others had none. While waiting, all fell asleep.  The five wise virgins represent true disciples of Christ in the Tribulation. The lamps speak of profession, and oil is generally acknowledged to be a type of the Holy Spirit. The foolish virgins represent those who profess to hold the Messianic hope but who have never been converted and thus do not have the Holy Spirit. The bridegroom is Christ, the King; His delay symbolizes the period between His two Advents. The fact that all ten virgins slept shows that outwardly there was not much to differentiate them.</p>
<p>At midnight the announcement rang out that the bridegroom was coming. In the previous chapter we learned that His arrival will be heralded by awesome signs.</p>
<p>The virgins arose and trimmed their lamps—all wanted to appear ready. The foolish ones, lacking oil, asked the others for some, but were sent to buy some. The wise ones’ refusal seems selfish, but in the spiritual realm, no one can dispense the Spirit to another. Of course, the Holy Spirit cannot be purchased, but the Bible does use the literary figure of buying salvation without money and without price.   While they were gone the bridegroom came. The faithful saints will go in with Him to the marriage feast. The marriage feast is a fitting designation of the joy and blessing of Christ’s earthly kingdom. The wise virgins went in with him to the wedding; and the door was closed. It was too late for anyone else to get into the kingdom. When the other virgins came seeking admittance, the bridegroom disavowed knowing them—a clear proof that they had never been born again.</p>
<p>The lesson, Jesus said, was to watch, because the day and hour of His coming are unknown. Believers should live as if the Lord might come at any moment. Are our lamps trimmed and filled with oil?</p>
<p> <strong>Parable of the Talents (25:14–30) </strong></p>
<p>This parable also teaches that when the Lord returns, there will be true and false servants. The story revolves around a man who, before going on a long journey, assembled his own servants and gave to each varying amounts of money, according to his own ability. One got five talents, another got two, and the last, one. They were to use this money to bring income to the master. The man with five earned another five talents. The man with two doubled his also. But the man with one went and dug a hole and buried it.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see that Christ is the master and the long journey is the inter-advent period. The three servants are responsible to represent the interests of the absent Lord. They are given responsibility according to their individual abilities.</p>
<p>After a long time the lord came back and settled accounts with them. This depicts the Second Advent. The first two received exactly the same commendation: “Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.” The test of their service was not how much they earned, but how hard they tried. Each used his ability fully and earned one hundred percent. These represent true believers whose reward is to enjoy blessings and responsibilities in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The third servant had nothing but insults and excuses for his master. He accused him of being hard and unreasonable, reaping where he had not sown, and gathering where he had not scattered seed. He excused himself on the basis that, paralyzed with fear, he buried his talent. This servant was doubtless an unbeliever; no genuine servant would entertain such thoughts of his master.</p>
<p>His lord rebuked him as wicked and lazy. Having such thoughts of his master, why hadn’t he deposited his money with the bankers to earn interest? Incidentally, in verse 26, the master is not agreeing with the charges against him. Rather he is saying, “If that’s the kind of master you thought I am, all the more reason to have put the talent to work. Your words condemn, not excuse you.”</p>
<p>If this man had earned one talent with his talent, he would have received the same commendation as the others. Instead, all he had to show for his life was a hole in the ground! His talent was taken and given to the man with ten talents. This follows a fixed law in the spiritual realm: “To everyone who has, more will be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.” Those who desire to be used for God’s glory are given the means. The more they do, the more they are enabled to do for Him. Conversely, we lose what we don’t use. Atrophy is the reward of indolence.</p>
<p>The unprofitable servant was cast out—excluded from the kingdom. He shared the anguished fate of the wicked. It was not his failure to invest the talent that condemned him; rather his lack of good works showed that he lacked saving faith.</p>
<p> <strong>The King Judges the Nations (25:31–46)<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em> </em></span></strong></p>
<p>This section describes the Judgment of the Nations, which is to be distinguished from the Judgment Seat of Christ and the Judgment of the Great White Throne.</p>
<p>The Judgment Seat of Christ, a time of review and reward for believers only, takes place after the Rapture of the Church at the “last trumpet”. The Judgment of the Great White Throne takes place in eternity, after the Millennium. The wicked dead will be judged and consigned to the Lake of Fire (Rev. 20:11–15).</p>
<p>The Judgment of the Nations takes place on earth after Christ comes to reign, as verse 31 clearly states: “When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him.” If we are right in identifying it with Joel 3, the location is the Valley of Jehoshaphat, outside Jerusalem (3:2). The nations will be judged according to their treatment of Christ’s brethren.</p>
<p>It is important to notice that three classes are mentioned—sheep, goats, and Christ’s brethren. The first two classes, over whom Christ sits in judgment, are nations. The third class is Christ’s faithful brethren who refuse to deny His Name in spite of towering persecution.</p>
<p>The King places the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left. He then invites the sheep to enter His glorious kingdom, prepared for them from the foundation of the world. The reason given is that they fed Him when hungry, gave Him drink when thirsty, welcomed Him when a stranger, clothed Him when ill-clad, visited Him in sickness, and went to Him in prison. The righteous sheep profess ignorance of ever showing such kindnesses to the King; He had not even been on earth in their generation. He explains that in befriending one of the least of His brethren, they befriended Him. Whatever is done for one of His disciples is rewarded as being done to Himself.</p>
<p>The unrighteous goats are told to depart from Him into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels because they failed to care for Him. When they excuse themselves by saying they had never seen Him, He reminds them that their neglect of His followers constituted neglect of Himself.</p>
<p>Thus the goats go away into everlasting punishment, but the sheep into eternal life. But this raises two problems. First, the passage seems to teach that nations are saved or lost en masse. Second, the narrative creates the impression that the sheep are saved by good works, and the goats are condemned through failure to do good. As to the first difficulty, it must be remembered that God does deal with nations as such. ﻿OT﻿ history abounds with instances of nations punished because of their sin (Isa. 10:12–19; 47:5–15; Ezek. 25:6, 7; Amos 1:3, 6, 9, 11, 13; 2:1, 4, 6; Obad. 10; Zech. 14:1–5). It is not unreasonable to believe that nations will continue to experience divine retribution. This does not mean that every single individual in the nation will be involved in the outcome, but that the principles of divine justice will be applied on a national, as well as an individual basis.</p>
<p>As to the second problem, the passage cannot be used to teach salvation by works. The uniform testimony of the Bible is that salvation is by faith and not by works (Eph. 2:8, 9). But the Bible is just as emphatic in teaching that true faith produces good works. If there are no good works, it is an indication that the person was never saved. So we must understand that the Nations (composed of individuals) are not saved by befriending the remnant, but that this kindness reflects their love for the Lord.</p>
<p>Two other points should be mentioned. First, the kingdom is said to have been prepared for the righteous from the foundation of the world (v. 34), whereas hell was prepared for the devil and his angels (v. 41). God’s desire is that men should be blessed; hell was not originally intended for the human race. But if people willfully refuse life, they necessarily choose death.</p>
<p>Finally the Judgment of the Nations reminds us forcefully that Christ and His people are one; what affects them affects Him. We have vast potential for showing kindness to Him by showing kindness to those who belong to Him.</p>
<h5>LESSON 19 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 26</strong></p>
<p><strong>Verses 6-13</strong></p>
<p>6 And when Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, 7 a woman came to Him having an alabaster flask of very costly fragrant oil, and she poured it on His head as He sat at the table. 8 But when His disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, “﻿Why this waste? 9 For this fragrant oil might have been sold for much and given to the poor.﻿”</p>
<p>10 But when Jesus was aware of it, He said to them, “﻿Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a good work for Me. 11 For you have the poor with you always, but Me you do not have always. 12 For in pouring this fragrant oil on My body, she did it for My burial. 13 Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.﻿”</p>
<p><strong>Verses 17-29</strong></p>
<p>17 Now on the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, “﻿Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?﻿”</p>
<p>18 And He said, “﻿Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, ‘﻿The Teacher says, “﻿My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.﻿” ﻿’</p>
<p>19 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</p>
<p>20 When evening had come, He sat down with the twelve. 21 Now as they were eating, He said, “﻿Assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray Me.﻿”</p>
<p>22 And they were exceedingly sorrowful, and each of them began to say to Him, “﻿Lord, is it I?﻿”</p>
<p>23 He answered and said, “﻿He who dipped his hand with Me in the dish will betray Me. 24 The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born.﻿”</p>
<p>25 Then Judas, who was betraying Him, answered and said, “﻿Rabbi, is it I?﻿”</p>
<p>He said to him, “﻿You have said it.﻿”</p>
<p>26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, “﻿Take, eat; this is My body.﻿”</p>
<p>27 Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “﻿Drink from it, all of you. 28 For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. 29 But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom.﻿”</p>
<p>Verses 30-56</p>
<p>30 And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</p>
<p>31 Then Jesus said to them, “﻿All of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: ‘﻿I will strike the Shepherd, And the sheep of the flock will be scattered.﻿’ 32 But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.﻿”</p>
<p>33 Peter answered and said to Him, “﻿Even if all are made to stumble because of You, I will never be made to stumble.﻿”</p>
<p>34 Jesus said to him, “﻿Assuredly, I say to you that this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.﻿”</p>
<p>35 Peter said to Him, “﻿Even if I have to die with You, I will not deny You!﻿”</p>
<p>And so said all the disciples.</p>
<p>36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, “﻿Sit here while I go and pray over there.﻿” 37 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. 38 Then He said to them, “﻿My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch with Me.﻿”</p>
<p>39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, “﻿O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.﻿”</p>
<p>40 Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, “﻿What! Could you not watch with Me one hour? 41 Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.﻿”</p>
<p>42 Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, “﻿O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done.﻿” 43 And He came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.</p>
<p>44 So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 45 Then He came to His disciples and said to them, “﻿Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners. 46 Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.﻿”</p>
<p>47 And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>
<p>48 Now His betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “﻿Whomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him.﻿” 49 Immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “﻿Greetings, Rabbi!﻿” and kissed Him.  50 But Jesus said to him, “﻿Friend, why have you come?﻿”</p>
<p>Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took Him. 51 And suddenly, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.  52 But Jesus said to him, “﻿Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword. 53 Or do you think that I cannot now pray to My Father, and He will provide Me with more than twelve legions of angels? 54 How then could the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?﻿”  55 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, “﻿Have you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me. 56 But all this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.﻿”</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Verses 6-13 – An Eternal Memorial</strong></p>
<p>When Jesus was at the house of Simon the leper in Bethany, a woman came in and poured out a flask of very expensive perfume on His head. The costliness of her sacrifice expressed the depth of her devotion for the Lord Jesus, saying, in effect, that there was nothing too good for Him.  His disciples, and Judas in particular (John 12:4, 5), looked upon the act as an enormous waste. They thought the money might better have been given to the poor.</p>
<p>Jesus corrected their distorted thinking. Her act was not wasteful, but beautiful. Not only so, it was perfectly timed. The poor can be helped at any time. But only once in the world’s history could the Savior be anointed for burial. That moment had struck and one lone woman with spiritual discernment had seized it. Believing the Lord’s predictions concerning His death, she must have realized it was now or never. As it turned out, she was right. Those women who planned to anoint His body after His burial were thwarted by the resurrection (Mark 16:1–6).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus immortalized her simple act of love: “Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.” Any act of true worship fills the courts of heaven with fragrance and is indelibly recorded in the Lord’s memory.</p>
<p><strong>Verses 17-29 – The Last Supper</strong></p>
<p>Since we will be observing Passover in a few weeks with a full re-creation of the Last Supper, I will not go into much detail on this section now.</p>
<p>Jesus sent the disciples to look for a certain unnamed man who would lead them to the appointed house. Perhaps the vagueness of the instructions was designed to foil the conspirators who were plotting against Him.  At any rate, we note Jesus’ full knowledge of individuals, their whereabouts, and their willingness to cooperate. Note His words, “The Teacher says, ‘My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with My disciples.’” He faced His approaching death with poise. With perfect grace, He arranged the meal. What a privilege for this anonymous man to lend his house for this final Passover!</p>
<p>As they were eating, Jesus made the shocking announcement that one of the twelve would betray Him. The disciples were filled with sorrow. One by one they asked, “Lord, is it I?” When all but Judas had inquired, Jesus told them that it was the one who dipped with Him in the dish. The Lord then took a piece of bread, dipped it in the “sop” (called charoset), and handed it to Judas (John 13:26)—a token of special affection and friendship. He reminded them that there was a certain irresistibility in what was going to happen to Him. But that did not free the traitor from responsibility; it would be better for him if he had never been born. Judas deliberately chose to sell the Savior and is thus held personally responsible.</p>
<p>When Judas finally asked point-blank if he were the one, Jesus answered, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Matthew now records Christ giving the true meaning to certain elements of the Passover Meal.  The bread (a specific piece of unleavened bread known as the “afikomen”), and the third of the ceremonial cups (known as the cup of redemption), are specifically identified with the death of Our Lord as the true sacrifice of Passover.  As John the Baptist had said at the beginning of Jesus’ ministry, “Behold, the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world!”</p>
<p><strong>Verses 30-56</strong></p>
<p>Following the Lord’s Supper, the little band sang a hymn, taken from Psalms 113–118—“the Great Hallel.” Then they left Jerusalem, crossed the Brook Kidron, and climbed the western slope of Olivet to the Garden of Gethsemane.</p>
<p>Throughout His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus had faithfully warned His disciples concerning the pathway ahead. Now He told them that they would all dissociate themselves from Him that night. Fear would overwhelm them when they saw the fury of the storm breaking. To save their own skins, they would forsake their Master. Zechariah’s prophecy would be fulfilled: “Strike the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered” (13:7).</p>
<p>But He did not leave them without hope. Though they would be ashamed of their association with Him, He would never forsake them. After rising from the dead, He would meet them in Galilee.  Peter rashly interrupted to assure the Lord that although the others might desert Him, he would never do such a thing. Jesus corrected the “never” to “this night &#8230; three times.”   Still protesting his loyalty, Peter insisted that he would die with Christ rather than deny Him. All the disciples chimed in their agreement. They were sincere; they meant what they said. It was just that they didn’t know their own hearts.</p>
<p>After entering Gethsemane (meaning olive vat or olive press), Jesus told eight of the eleven disciples with Him to sit and wait, then took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee deeper into the garden.   He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed. He frankly told Peter, James, and John that His soul was exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. This was probably in part due to the unspeakable revulsion of His holy soul as He anticipated becoming a sin-offering for us. We who are sinful cannot conceive what it meant to Him, the Sinless One, to be made sin for us (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>“O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.”  In case we would think this prayer expressed reluctance or a desire to turn back, we should remember His words in John 12:27, 28: “Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour’? But for this purpose I came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name.” Therefore, in praying that the cup might pass from Him, He was not asking to be delivered from going to the cross. That was the very purpose of His coming into the world!</p>
<p>However, Jesus was also human.  No human in his right mind would be eager to be beaten, cursed, and crucified.  Jesus was not turning away from His task in the least, but He was human enough to express dismay at what was to come.</p>
<p>Returning to the disciples, He found them sleeping. Their spirits were willing; their flesh was weak. We dare not condemn them when we think of our own prayer lives; we sleep better than we pray, and our minds wander when they should be watching. How often the Lord has to say to us as He said to Peter, “Could you not watch with Me one hour? Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.”</p>
<p>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, expressing submission to the Father’s will. He would drink the cup of suffering and death to the dregs.</p>
<p>When He came to the disciples the second time, they were asleep again. Likewise the third time: He prayed, they slept. It was then He said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.”</p>
<p>The betrayal of the sinless Savior by one of His own creations presents one of the most amazing anomalies of history. Apart from human depravity we would be at a loss to explain the base, inexcusable treachery of Judas.  While Jesus was still speaking to the eleven, Judas arrived with a gang armed with swords and clubs.  Judas would use a kiss as the sign to help the mob distinguish Jesus from His disciples. The universal symbol of love was to be prostituted to its lowest use.   As he approached the Lord, Judas said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” then kissed Him profusely.</p>
<p>One of the disciples—we know from John 18:10 that it was Peter—drew his sword and cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant. It is unlikely that Peter had aimed for the ear; he had doubtless planned a mortal blow.  The moral glory of the Lord Jesus shines radiantly here. First He rebuked Peter.  We learn Luke that Jesus then healed the ear of Malchus—for that was the victim’s name (Luke 22:51; John 18:10). Is this not a wonderful display of grace? He loved those who hated Him and showed kindness to those who were after His life.</p>
<p>If Jesus had desired to resist the mob, He would not have been limited to Peter’s puny sword. In an instant He could have asked for and been sent more than twelve legions of angels (from 36,000 to 72,000, depending on which type of legion is meant). But that would only have frustrated the divine program. The Scriptures predicting His betrayal, suffering, crucifixion, and resurrection had to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Then Jesus reminded the crowds how incongruous it was for them to come out after Him with weapons. They had never seen Him resort to violence or engage in plunder. Rather, He had been a quiet Teacher, daily sitting in the temple. They could easily have captured Him then, but didn’t. Why come now with swords and clubs? Humanly speaking, their behavior was irrational.</p>
<p>Yet the Savior realized that man’s wickedness was succeeding only in accomplishing the definite plan of God. “All this was done that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Realizing there would be no deliverance for their Master, all the disciples forsook Him and fled in panic. If their cowardice was inexcusable, our cowardice in following the Lord is more so. They had not yet been indwelt by the Holy Spirit; we have.</p>
<h5>LESSON 20 – Matthew </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 28:16-20</strong></p>
<p>16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them. 17 When they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some doubted.  18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, “﻿All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. 19 Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 20 teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.﻿” Amen.</p>
<p><strong>The Great Commission (28:16–20) </strong></p>
<p>In Galilee the risen Lord Jesus appeared to His disciples at an unnamed mountain. This is the same appearance recorded in Mark 16:15–18 and 1 Corinthians 15:6. What a wonderful reunion! His sufferings were passed forever. Because He lived, they too would live. He stood before them in His glorified body.</p>
<p>Then the Lord explained that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth. In one sense, of course, He always had all authority. But here He was speaking of authority as Head of the new creation. Since His death and resurrection, He had authority to give eternal life to all whom God had given to Him (John 17:2). He had always had power as the creator of all things.  But now that He had completed the work of redemption, He had authority as the first-born from the dead—“that in all things He may have the preeminence” (Col. 1:15, 18).</p>
<p>As Head of the new creation, He then issued the Great Commission, containing “standing orders” for all believers during the present phase of the kingdom—the time between the rejection of the King and His Second Advent.</p>
<p>The Commission contains three <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">commands</span></em></strong>:</p>
<p>1. “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations.” This does not presuppose world conversion. By preaching the gospel, the disciples were to see others become learners or followers of the Savior—from every nation, tribe, people, and tongue.</p>
<p>2. Baptize “them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.”  In Biblical baptism, Christians publicly identify themselves with the Triune Godhead. They acknowledge that God is their Father, that Jesus Christ is their Lord and Savior, and that the Holy Spirit is the One who indwells, empowers, and teaches them.  The word ‘Name’ in verse 19 is singular. One name or essence, yet three Persons—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>3. Teach “them to observe all things that I have commanded you.” The Commission goes beyond evangelism; it is not enough to simply make converts and let them fend for themselves. They must be taught to obey the commandments of Christ.  The essence of discipleship is becoming like the Master, and this is brought about by systematic teaching of, and submission to, the Word.</p>
<p>Then the Savior added a promise of His presence with His disciples until the consummation of the age. They would not go forth alone or unaided. In all their service and travel, they would know the companionship of the Son of God.</p>
<p>Notice the four “alls” connected with the Great Commission: all authority; all nations; all things; always.</p>
<p>Nearly twenty centuries later His words have the same impact, relevance, and application to believers. </p>
<p>What are <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">we</span></em></strong> doing to carry out His last command?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Note: <a href="http://www.cbcmidway.org/?p=1280">View part two here</a></strong></p>
<h5>LESSON 1</h5>
<p>In looking at the words of Christ in the Gospels, we need to remember that three of the Gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) present a fairly unified view of the events recorded, and are therefore referred to as the SYNOPTIC (meaning “one view) Gospels.  John’s Gospel stands separately, and is mainly composed of material that is different from the others.<span id="more-1277"></span></p>
<p><strong>The Words Of Christ In Matthew (Part 1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 3:13-15<br />
</strong>13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him. 14 And John tried to prevent Him, saying, “I need to be baptized by You, and are You coming to me?”  15 But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it to be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he allowed Him.</p>
<p>All four Gospels relate this event  with unquestioned historical verification. While this section of Matthew’s gospel centers upon Galilee, Jesus now goes south to the Jordan River to be baptized (vs. 13). The word baptize (Gr baptizo) means to dip or immerse in water, indicating the true form of baptism by immersion. John forbade him (vs. 14) for the obvious reason that Jesus needed no repentance of sin and John felt unworthy of this opportunity. The tense of the Greek verb emphasizes that John tried to hinder him. Thus, this was no casual hesitation on the part of the Baptist.  Permit it to be so means allow it to be or let it happen. Jesus sought this outward identification with John’s ministry to fulfil all righteousness. By identifying Himself with those whom He came to redeem, Jesus inaugurated His public ministry as the Messiah. In regard to the Jewish religious observances, Jesus always met the duties of a faithful Jew: synagogue worship, attendance at  feasts, payment of the Temple tax, etc.<br />
During the Temptation in the Wilderness, Jesus makes comments in response to Satan that are very significant for us as Christians in our struggle against temptation.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 4:4</strong><br />
4 But He answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.’”</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 4:7<br />
</strong>7 Jesus said to him, “It is written again, ‘You shall not tempt the LORD your God.’ ”</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 4:10<br />
</strong>10 Then Jesus said to him, “Away with you, Satan! For it is written, ‘You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.’ ”</p>
<p>The victory in each aspect of the temptation is related to Jesus’ use of Scripture. His source of strength was obedience to the Father’s will and He would not even work a miracle to avoid personal suffering when such suffering was a part of God’s purpose for Him.  This is important for us, because the weapon that He used against Satan is the one weapon that we also have available: God’s Word.  Our knowledge of, and obedience to, the Bible is our real source of strength in this world.<br />
<strong>Matthew 4:17<br />
</strong>17 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”</p>
<p>The message of John the Baptist is now clearly proclaimed by Jesus Christ. However, Jesus, as the Messiah, is not calling on His listeners to prepare for the coming of the kingdom but rather announces that the kingdom is here. In a very real sense the first coming of the King is an honest, straightforward presentation of the kingdom promised by the Old Testament prophets to the people of Israel. Thus, we find unusual miracles attending Jesus’ presentation of this kingdom: incurable diseases and incomprehensible afflictions are cured by the power of His touch and His word. The kingdom blessings promised in Isaiah 35:5–6 to be fulfilled in a future kingdom, here become the credentials of the King in His first coming.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 4:18-19<br />
</strong>18 And Jesus, walking by the Sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen. 19 Then He said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of men.”</p>
<p>The invitation, Follow me, called these believers into a permanent ministry to be shared with Christ. I will make you fishers of men clearly indicates the nature of this ministry. They would receive special training in bringing men into the kingdom. These former fishermen would literally become fishers of men! There can be no doubt that aggressive personal evangelism was and still is a major priority in the believer’s life. Our obedience to the lordship of Christ is evidenced by our carrying forth the mission to which He has committed us.<br />
<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 5:1 – 7:29  (The Sermon On The Mount)<br />
</strong>Although this portion all contains one sermon, we will look at it in sections for ease of study.</p>
<p>1 And seeing the multitudes, He went up on a mountain, and when He was seated His disciples came to Him. 2 Then He opened His mouth and taught them, saying:<br />
3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 4 Blessed are those who mourn, For they shall be comforted. 5 Blessed are the meek, For they shall inherit the earth. 6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, For they shall be filled. 7 Blessed are the merciful, For they shall obtain mercy.<br />
8 Blessed are the pure in heart, For they shall see God. 9 Blessed are the peacemakers, For they shall be called sons of God. 10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 11 “Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake. 12 Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</p>
<p>The opening verses of the Sermon on the Mount indicate that this message deals with the inner state of mind and heart which is the indispensable absolute of true Christian discipleship. It shows the outward character and conduct of the true believer and genuine disciple.  Embodied in the Sermon on the Mount is a summation of Jesus’ basic ethical teaching of the life of a born-again man. While the Sermon on the Mount is not a way of salvation, neither is it only a message to those under the law, for it obviously goes beyond the law. It is a presentation of Christian discipleship which can be wrought in the soul of an individual only by the power of God. This message does not tell one how to be saved; it tells one what it is like to be saved. It explains the quality of the life changed by the saving grace of God. Its basic truths are reiterated everywhere throughout the New Testament epistles.  In the Sermon on the Mount Jesus states the spiritual character and quality of the kingdom which He wished to establish. The basic qualities of this kingdom are fulfilled in the church which He would establish. Virtually every section of this message is repeated in the substance elsewhere throughout the New Testament. There is nothing here to indicate that this message is to be limited in its application only to the people of Israel.</p>
<p>Blessed means “happy.” This is a basic description of the believers’ inner condition as a result of the work of God.  These Beatitudes, like Psalm 1, do not show a man how to be saved, but rather describe the characteristics of one who has been saved. The poor in spirit are the opposite of the proud or haughty in spirit. These are those who have been humbled by the grace of God and have acknowledged their sin and therefore their dependence upon God to save them. They are the ones who will inherit the kingdom of heaven. It is obvious in this usage that the kingdom of heaven is a general designation of the dwelling place of the saved.</p>
<p>Those that mourn … shall be comforted. The depth of the promise of these statements is almost inexhaustible. Those who mourn for sin shall be comforted in confession. Those who mourn for the human anguish of the lost shall be comforted by the compassion of God.</p>
<p>The meek … shall inherit the earth refers again to those who have been humbled before God and will inherit, not only the blessedness of heaven, but shall ultimately share in the kingdom of God upon the earth. Here, in the opening statements of the Sermon on the Mount, is the balance between the physical and spiritual promise of the kingdom. The kingdom of which Jesus preached is both “in you” and is yet “to come.” The Christian is the spiritual citizen of the kingdom of heaven now.  These future possessors of the earth are its presently-installed rightful heirs and even now they hunger and thirst after righteousness. They experience a deep desire for personal righteousness which is, in itself, a proof of their spiritual re-birth. Those who are poor and empty in their own spiritual poverty recognize the depth of their need and hunger and thirst for that which only God can give them. To hunger means to be needy. It is joined with to thirst; the born-again man has a God-given hunger and thirst (inner passion) for righteousness. This hungering and thirsting continues throughout the life of the believer. He continues to hunger and to be filled and to hunger and to be filled. God supplies his every spiritual need daily. This act of hungering and thirsting after righteousness is the by-product of a regenerated life.</p>
<p>This is the description of a man who has already been saved. Nowhere does the Bible command unbelievers to hunger after righteousness in order to be saved. Rather, Paul clearly states “there is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God” (Rom 3:11). The biblical writers make it clear that while man must come to Christ for salvation, it is not within man’s normal ability and desire to want to come to God. Therefore, God is depicted throughout the New Testament as the seeking Savior going after the lost. They shall be filled (Gr chortazō) refers to a complete filling and satisfaction. The psalmist proclaimed: “He satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness” (107:9). This filling comes from God, who is the total source of satisfaction of His people. It comes now and it will continue to come throughout eternity to those who hunger and thirst for it.</p>
<p>Those who are merciful … shall obtain mercy has reference to those who have been born again by the mercy of God. Because divine love has been extended to them, they have the work of the Holy Spirit in them producing a mercy which defies explanation by unregenerate men. Jesus Himself became the ultimate example of this when He cried from the cross, “Father, forgive them for they know not what they do” (Lk 23:34).  The believer does not show mercy in order to obtain mercy, he shows mercy because he has obtained mercy. In so continuing to show the evidence of the grace of God in his life he continues to receive that grace. In other words, he is not saved simply because he shows mercy and is kind to people. He shows mercy and is kind because he is saved.</p>
<p>Those who are truly saved shall see God. These are the pure in heart. Their lives have been transformed by the grace of God. They are not yet sinless but their position before God has been changed. They have the new birth, saving faith and holiness. The process of sanctification is ever conforming them to the image of Christ (Rom 8:29), which image consists in “righteousness and true holiness” (Eph 4:24). Purity of heart is both the end of our election and the goal of our redemption. We read in Ephesians 1:4, “He has chosen us that we should be holy” and Titus 2:14, “who gave himself for us that he might redeem us unto himself a peculiar people.” To which we add Hebrews 12:14, “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord.”</p>
<p>The next description deals with the peacemakers. They are the ones who are themselves at peace with God and live in peace with all men (cf. Rom 5:1). They are called “the” peacemakers for these are not social reformers, but rather the ones reformed by the regenerating power of the gospel. They are peacemakers because they themselves are at peace with God. They have entered into the peace of Christ and thus are ambassadors of God’s message of peace to a troubled world.  They shall be called the children of God. These only shall be called the sons of God! Throughout the Beatitudes Jesus clearly underscores that only those who have the life-changing qualities herein described are citizens of His kingdom.</p>
<p> As Jesus develops His message He makes it clear that such a life causes His people to be in direct contrast to the world in which they live. Therefore He reminds, Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake. The plural use of “you” in verse 11 indicates that He foresaw this persecution as touching all His followers. Notice II Timothy 3:12, “Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.” The nature of this persecution (Gr diōkō) implies a driving or chasing away, a withstanding or keeping one from his goal. This does not mean that every Christian will necessarily suffer physical abuse as evidence of true salvation. While many Christians have sealed their faith with their blood, many more have had to withstand the social temptations and pressures of the world in order to live effectively for Christ.</p>
<p>Again, Jesus warns that men shall revile you, and persecute you. This became true during His own ministry, in the lives of the apostles and throughout the history of the church. But in Tertullian’s words, “The blood of the martyrs became the seed of the church.” The persecution spoken of here is twofold. First, it involves a physical pursuing of the persecuted and secondly a personal attack of slander against them.</p>
<p>Rejoice is the command that grows out of the blessedness of the believer. The phrase “rejoice and be exceeding glad” means rejoice, but even more exalt! The believer who is the blessed one may not only rejoice in tribulation but he may rejoice exceedingly to the point of exaltation. Therefore, he glories in tribulation even as the Apostle Paul (cf. II Cor 1:3–7; 12:7–10). Great is your reward in heaven focuses attention upon the eternal, spiritual destiny of all things. If God is as real as He claims, if the Bible is true, if heaven is to be gained, then there is no temporary earthly trouble or persecution that can thwart the child of God from the eternal glory that lies ahead. In Romans 8:18, Paul proclaimed, “I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.”</p>
<h5>LESSON 2 – The Sermon On The Mount, Part 2</h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 5:13-48<br />
</strong>13 “You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavor, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men.<br />
14 “You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house.16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.<br />
17 “Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfill. 18 For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled. 19 Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 20 For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. 21 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgment.’ 22 But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raca!’ shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be in danger of hell fire.23 Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,24 leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.25 Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest your adversary deliver you to the judge, the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.26 Assuredly, I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.27 “You have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’28 But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.29 If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. 30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.<br />
31 “Furthermore it has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’ 32 But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.<br />
33 “Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’ 34 But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; 35 nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. 36 Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. 37 But let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes,’ and your ‘No,’ ‘No.’ For whatever is more than these is from the evil one.<br />
38 “You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’ 39 But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. 40 If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also. 41 And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. 42 Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away.<br />
43 “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 44 But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, 45 that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 46 For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 47 And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? 48 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Believers Are Salt and Light (5:13–16)<br />
</strong>Jesus likened His disciples to salt. They were to the world what salt is in everyday life: salt seasons food; it hinders the spread of corruption; it creates thirst; it brings out the flavor. So His followers add to human society, serve as a preservative, and make others long for the righteousness described in the preceding verses.  If salt loses its flavor, how can its saltiness be restored? There is no way to restore the true, natural taste. Once it has lost its flavor, salt is good for nothing. It is discarded on a footpath. Albert Barnes’ comment on this passage is illuminating:  The salt used in this country is a chemical compound—and if the saltiness were lost, or it were to lose its savor, there would be nothing remaining. In eastern countries, however, the salt used was impure, mingled with vegetable and earthly substances; so that it might lose the whole of its saltiness, and a considerable quantity [of salt without flavor] remain. This was good for nothing except that it was used, as it is said, to place in paths, or walks, as we use gravel.</p>
<p>The disciple has one great function—to be the salt of the earth by living out the terms of discipleship listed in the Beatitudes and throughout the rest of the Sermon. If he fails to exhibit this spiritual reality, men will tread his testimony under their feet. The world has only contempt for an undedicated believer.<br />
Jesus also calls Christians the light of the world. He spoke of Himself as “the light of the world” (John 8:12; 12:35, 36, 46). The relationship between these two statements is that Jesus is the source of light; Christians are the reflection of His light. Their function is to shine for Him just as the moon reflects the glory of the sun.  People do not light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they put it on a lamp-stand so that it will give light to all who are in the house. He did not intend that we hoard the light of His teaching for ourselves, but that we share it with others. We should let our light so shine that as people see our good works, they will glorify our Father in heaven. The emphasis is on the ministry of Christian character. The lives in which Christ is seen speaks louder than words.</p>
<p><strong>Christ Fulfills the Law (5:17–20)<br />
</strong>Most revolutionary leaders sever all ties with the past and repudiate the traditional, existing order. Not so the Lord Jesus. He upheld the Law of Moses and insisted that it must be fulfilled. Jesus had not come to abolish the Law or the Prophets, but to fulfill them. He clearly insisted that not one jot or one tittle would pass from the law until it was completely fulfilled. The jot, or yod, is the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet; the tittle is a small mark or projection that serves to distinguish one letter from another, much as the bottom stroke of a capital E distinguishes it from a capital F. Jesus believed in the literal inspiration of the Bible, even in what might seem small unimportant details. Nothing in Scripture, even the smallest stroke, is without significance.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Jesus Warns Against Anger (5:21–26)<br />
</strong>The Jews of Jesus’ time knew that murder was forbidden by God and that the murderer was liable to punishment. This was true before the giving of the law (Gen. 9:6) and it was later incorporated into the law (Ex. 20:13; Deut. 5:17). With the words, “But I say to you,” Jesus institutes an amendment to the teaching on murder. No longer could a person take pride in having never committed murder. Jesus now says, ”In My kingdom, you must not even have murderous thoughts.” He traces the act of murder to its source and warns against three forms of unrighteous anger.</p>
<p>The first is the case of a person who is angry with his brother without a cause. One accused of this crime would be in danger of the judgment—that is, he could be taken to court. Most people can find what they think is a valid cause for their anger, but anger is justified only when God’s honor is at stake or when someone else is being wronged. It is never right when ex pressed in retaliation for personal wrongs.</p>
<p>Even more serious is the sin of insulting a brother. In Jesus’ day, people used the word Raca (an Aramaic term meaning ”empty one”) as a word of contempt and abuse. Those who used this epithet were in danger of the council —that is, they were subject to trial before the Sanhedrin, the highest court in the land.</p>
<p>Finally, to call someone a fool is the third form of unrighteous anger that Jesus condemns. Here the word fool means more than just a dunce. It signifies a moral fool who ought to be dead and it expresses the wish that he were. Today it is common to hear a person cursing another with the words, ”God damn you!” He is calling on God to consign the victim to hell. Jesus says that the one who utters such a curse is in danger of hell fire. The bodies of executed criminals were often thrown into a burning dump outside Jerusalem known as the Valley of Hinnom or Gehenna. This was a figure of the fires of hell which shall never be quenched.</p>
<p>There is no mistaking the severity of the Savior’s words. He teaches that anger contains the seeds of murder, that abusive language contains the spirit of murder, and that cursing language implies the very desire to murder. The progressive heightening of the crimes demand three degrees of punishment: the judgment, the council, and hell fire. In the kingdom, Jesus will deal with sins according to severity.</p>
<p>If a person offends another, whether by anger or any other cause, there is no use in his bringing a gift to God. The Lord will not be pleased with it. The offender should first go and make the wrong right. Only then will the gift be acceptable.  God receives no worship from a believer who is not on speaking terms with another.  If you are wrong, be quick to admit it and make things right. If you remain unrepentant, your sin will eventually catch up with you and you will not only have to make full restitution but suffer additional penalties as well.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Condemns Adultery (5:27–30)<br />
</strong>The Mosaic Law clearly prohibited adultery (Ex. 20:14; Deut. 5:18). A person might be proud that he had never broken this commandment, and yet have his ”eyes full of adultery” (2 Pet. 2:14). While outwardly respectable, his mind might be constantly wandering down labyrinths of impurity. So Jesus reminded His disciples that mere abstinence from the physical act was not enough—there must be inward purity. The law forbade the act of adultery; Jesus forbids the desire.  Maintaining an undefiled thought life demands strict self-discipline. Thus, Jesus taught that if any part of our body causes us to sin, it would be better to lose that member during life rather than to lose one’s soul for eternity. Are we to take Jesus’ words literally? Was He actually advocating self-mutilation? The words are literal to this extent: if it were necessary to lose a member rather than one’s soul, then we should gladly part with the member. Fortunately it is never necessary, since the Holy Spirit empowers the believer to live a holy life. However, there must be cooperation and rigid discipline on the believer’s part.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Censures Divorce (5:31, 32)<br />
</strong>Under OT law, divorce was permitted according to Deuteronomy 24:1–4. This passage was not concerned with the case of an adulterous wife (the penalty for adultery was death, see Deut. 22:22). Rather, it deals with divorce because of dislike or “incompatibility.”   However, in the kingdom of Christ, whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery. This does not mean that she automatically becomes an adulteress; it presupposes that, having no means of support, she is forced to live with another man. In so doing she becomes an adulteress. Not only is the former wife living in adultery, whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.</p>
<p>The subject of divorce and remarriage is one of the most complicated topics in the Bible. It is virtually impossible to answer all the questions that arise, but it may be helpful to survey and summarize what we believe the Scriptures teach.</p>
<p><strong>EXCURSUS ON DIVORCE AND REMARRIAGE<br />
</strong>Divorce was never God’s intention for man. His ideal is that one man and one woman remain married until their union is broken by death (Rom. 7:2, 3). Jesus made this clear to the Pharisees by appealing to the divine order at creation (Matt. 19:4–6).   God hates divorce (Mal. 2:16), that is, unscriptural divorce. He does not hate all divorce because He speaks of Himself as having divorced Israel (Jer. 3:8). This was because the nation forsook Him to worship idols. Israel was unfaithful.   In Matthew 5:31, 32 and 19:9, Jesus taught that divorce was forbidden except when one of the partners had been guilty of sexual immorality.  Therefore, even though divorce is not the ideal, it is permitted in the case where one’s partner has been unfaithful. Jesus allows divorce, but He does not command it.  Some scholars (and myself) see 1 Corinthians 7:12–16 as teaching that divorce is acceptable when a believer is deserted by an unbeliever. Paul says that the remaining person is ”not under bondage in such cases,” i.e., he or she is free to obtain a divorce (for desertion).</p>
<p>In any discussion of this topic, the question inevitably arises, “What about people who were divorced before they were saved?” There should be no question that unlawful divorces and remarriages contracted before conversion are sins which have been fully forgiven (see, for example, 1 Cor. 6:11 where Paul includes adultery in the list of sins in which the Corinthian believers had formerly participated). Pre-conversion sins do not bar believers from full participation in the local church.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Christians who have been divorced unscripturally and then remarried can truly repent of their sin and be restored to the Lord and to the fellowship of the church. In the matter of divorce, it seems that almost every case is different. Therefore, the elders of a local church must investigate each case individually and judge it according to the Word of God. If at times, disciplinary action has to be taken, all concerned should submit to the decision of the elders.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Condemns Oaths (5:33–37)</strong><br />
The Mosaic Law contained several prohibitions against swearing falsely by the name of God (Lev. 19:12; Num. 30:2; Deut. 23:21). To swear by God’s Name meant that He was your witness that you were telling the truth. The Jews sought to avoid the impropriety of swearing falsely by God’s Name by substituting heaven, earth, Jerusalem, or their head as that by which they swore.<br />
Jesus condemns such circumvention of the law as sheer hypocrisy and forbids any form of swearing or oaths in ordinary conversation. Not only was it hypocritical, it was useless to try to avoid swearing by God’s Name by merely substituting another noun for His Name. To swear by heaven is to swear by God’s throne. To swear by the earth is to swear by His footstool. To swear by Jerusalem is to swear by the royal capital. Even to swear by one’s own head involves God because He is the Creator of all.  For the Christian, an oath is unnecessary. His Yes should mean Yes, and his No should mean No.</p>
<p><strong>Going the Second Mile (5:38–42)</strong><br />
The law said, “An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth” (Ex. 21:24; Lev. 24:20; Deut. 19:21). This was both a command to punish and a limitation on punishment—the penalty must not exceed the crime. However, according to the OT, authority for punishment was vested in the government, not in the individual.   Jesus went beyond the law to a higher righteousness by abolishing retaliation altogether. He showed His disciples that, whereas revenge was once legally permissible, now grace on our part was possible.</p>
<p>Humanly speaking, such behavior as the Lord calls for here is impossible. Only as a person is controlled by the Holy Spirit can he live a self-sacrificing life. Only as the Savior is allowed to live His life in the believer can insult (v. 39), injustice (v. 40), and inconvenience (v. 41) be repaid with love. This is “the gospel of the second mile.”</p>
<p><strong>Love Your Enemies (5:43–48)<br />
</strong>Our Lord’s final example of the higher righteousness demanded in His kingdom concerns the treatment of one’s enemies, a topic which grows naturally out of the previous paragraph. The law had taught the Israelites to love their neighbor (Lev. 19:18). Although they were never explicitly commanded to hate their enemy, this spirit underlay much of their indoctrination. This attitude was a summary of the OT’s outlook toward those who persecuted God’s people (see Ps. 139:21, 22). It was a righteous hostility directed against the enemies of God.<br />
But now Jesus announces that we are to love our enemies and to pray for those who &#8230; persecute us. The fact that love is commanded shows that it is a matter of the will and not primarily of the emotions. It is not the same as natural affection because it is not natural to love those who hate and harm you. It is a supernatural grace and can be manifested only by those who have divine life.</p>
<p>There is no reward if we love those who love us; Jesus says that even unconverted tax collectors do that! That type of love requires no divine power. Neither is there any virtue in greeting our brethren only, i.e., our relatives and friends. The unsaved can do that; there is nothing distinctively Christian about it. If our standards are no higher than the world’s, it is certain that we will never make an impact on the world.</p>
<p>Jesus said that His followers should return good for evil so that they might be sons of their Father in heaven. He was not saying that this was the way to become sons of God; rather, it is how we show that we are God’s children. Since God shows no partiality to either the evil or the good (in that both benefit from sun and rain), so we should deal graciously and fairly with all.</p>
<p>Jesus closes this section with the admonition: Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. The word perfect must be understood in the light of the context. It does not mean sinless or flawless. The previous verses explain that to be perfect means to love those who hate us, to pray for those who persecute us, and to show kindness to both friend and foe.</p>
<p>Perfection here is that spiritual maturity which enables a Christian to imitate God in dispensing blessing to everybody without partiality.</p>
<h5>LESSON 3 – The Sermon On The Mount, Part 3</h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 6<br />
</strong>1 “Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. 2 Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 3 But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, 4 that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.<br />
5 “And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 6 But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. 7 And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words.</p>
<p>8 “Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him. 9 In this manner, therefore, pray:<br />
Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name.  10 Your kingdom come.  Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.  11 Give us this day our daily bread.  12 And forgive us our debts, As we forgive our debtors.  13 And do not lead us into temptation, But deliver us from the evil one.  For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.<br />
14 “For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. 15 But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p>16 “Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. 17 But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, 18 so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.<br />
19 “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; 20 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. 21 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.  22 “The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. 23 But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!<br />
24 “No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.  25 “Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? 26 Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? 27 Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?  28 “So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; 29 and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. 30 Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?  31 “Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ 32 For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. 33 But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. 34 Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Give with Sincerity (6:1–4)<br />
</strong>In the first half of this chapter, Jesus deals with three specific areas of practical righteousness in an individual’s life: charitable deeds (vv. 1–4), prayer (vv. 5–15), and fasting (vv. 16–18). The name Father is found ten times in these eighteen verses and is the key to understanding them. Practical deeds of righteousness should be done for His approval, not for people’s.</p>
<p>He begins this portion of His sermon with a warning against the temptation to parade our piety by performing charitable deeds for the purpose of being seen by others. It is not the deed that He condemns, but the motive. If public notice is the motivating factor then it is the only reward, for God will not reward hypocrisy.<br />
It seems incredible that hypocrites would noisily attract attention to themselves as they gave offerings in the synagogues or handouts to beggars in the streets. The Lord dismissed their conduct with the terse comment: “They have their reward” (their only reward is the reputation they gain while on earth).   When a follower of Christ does a charitable deed, it is to be done in secret. It should be so secret that Jesus told His disciples: “Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.” Jesus uses this graphic figure of speech to show that our charitable deeds should be for the Father, and not to gain notoriety for the giver.<br />
This passage should not be pressed to prohibit any gift that might be seen by others, since it is virtually impossible to make all one’s contributions strictly anonymous. It simply condemns the blatant display of giving.</p>
<p><strong>Pray with Sincerity (6:5–8)<br />
</strong>Next Jesus warns His disciples against hypocrisy when they pray. They should not purposely position themselves in public areas so that others will see them praying and be impressed by their piety. If the love for prominence is the only motive in prayer, then, Jesus declares, the prominence gained is the only reward.  In verses 5 and 7, the Greek pronoun translated you is plural. But in verse 6, in order to emphasize private communion with God, “you” switches to singular. The key to answered prayer is to do it in secret (i.e., go into your room and shut your door). If our real motive is to get through to God, He will hear and answer.   It is reading too much into the passage to use it to prohibit public prayer. The early church met together for collective prayer (Acts 2:42; 12:12; 13:3; 14:23; 20:36). The point is not where we pray. At issue here is, why we pray—to be seen by people or to be heard by God.   Prayer should not consist of vain repetitions, i.e., stock sentences or empty phrases. Unsaved people pray like that, but God is not impressed by the mere multiplication of many words. He wants to hear the sincere expressions of the heart.</p>
<p>Since our Father knows the things we have need of, even before we ask Him, then it is reasonable to ask, “Why pray at all?” The reason is that, in prayer, we acknowledge our need and dependence on Him. It is the basis of our communicating with God. Also God does things in answer to prayer that He would not have done otherwise (Jas. 4:2d).</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Teaches the Model Prayer (6:9–15)<br />
</strong>In verses 9–13 we have what is generally called ”The Lord’s Prayer.” In using this title, however, we should remember that Jesus never prayed it Himself. It was given to His disciples as a model after which they could pattern their prayers. It was not given as the exact words they were to use (v. 7 seems to rule this out), because many words repeated by rote memory can become empty phrases.</p>
<p>Our Father in heaven. Prayer should be addressed to God the Father in acknowledgment of His sovereignty over the universe.</p>
<p>Hallowed be Your name. We should begin our prayers with worship, ascribing praise and honor to Him who is so worthy of it.</p>
<p>Your kingdom come. After worship, we should pray for the advancement of God’s cause, putting His interests first. Specifically, we should pray for the day when our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, will set up His kingdom on earth and reign in righteousness.</p>
<p>Your will be done. In this petition we acknowledge that God knows what is best and that we surrender our will to His. It also expresses a longing to see His will acknowledged throughout the world.</p>
<p>On earth as it is in heaven. This phrase modifies all three preceding petitions. The worship of God, the sovereign rule by God, and the performance of His will are all a reality of heaven. The prayer is that these conditions might exist on earth as they do in heaven.</p>
<p>Give us this day our daily bread. After putting God’s interests first, we are permitted to present our own needs. This petition acknowledges our dependence on God for daily food, both spiritual and physical.</p>
<p>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. This does not refer to judicial forgiveness from the penalty of sin (that forgiveness is obtained by faith in the Son of God). Rather this refers to the parental forgiveness that is necessary if fellowship with our Father is to be maintained. If believers are unwilling to forgive those who wrong them, how can they expect to be in fellowship with their Father who has freely forgiven them for their wrongdoings?</p>
<p>And do not lead us into temptation. This request may appear to contradict James 1:13, which states that God would never tempt anyone. However, God does allow His people to be tested and tried. This petition expresses a healthy distrust of one’s own ability to resist temptations or to stand up under trial. It acknowledges complete dependence on the Lord for preservation.</p>
<p>But deliver us from the evil one. This is the prayer of all who desperately desire to be kept from sin by the power of God. It is the heart’s cry for daily salvation from the power of sin and Satan in one’s life.</p>
<p>For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.<br />
Such a doxology is the perfect ending to the prayer.  It seems to be a paraphrase of 1st Chronicles 29:10-11, which says, “10 Therefore David blessed the LORD before all the assembly; and David said: “Blessed are You, LORD God of Israel, our Father, forever and ever.  11 Yours, O LORD, is the greatness, The power and the glory, The victory and the majesty; For all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, And You are exalted as head over all.”</p>
<p>Verses 14-15 serve as an explanatory footnote to verse 12. It is not part of the prayer, but added to emphasize that the parental forgiveness mentioned in verse 12 is conditional.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Teaches How to Fast (6:16–18)<br />
</strong>The third form of religious hypocrisy that Jesus denounced was the deliberate attempt to create an appearance of fasting. The hypocrites disfigured their faces when they fasted in order to look gaunt, haggard, and doleful. But Jesus says it is ridiculous to attempt to appear holy.  True believers should fast in secret, giving no outward appearance of it. To anoint your head and wash your face was a means of appearing in one’s normal manner. It is enough that the Father knows; His reward will be better than people’s approval.</p>
<p>Fasting has no merit as far as salvation is concerned; neither does it give a Christian special standing before God. A Pharisee once boasted that he fasted twice a week; however, it failed to bring him the justification he sought (Luke 18:12, 14). But when a Christian fasts secretly as a spiritual exercise, God sees and rewards. While not commanded in the NT, it is encouraged by promise of reward. It can aid in one’s prayer life by taking away dullness and drowsiness. It is valuable in times of crisis when one wishes to discern the will of God. And it is of value in promoting self-discipline. Fasting is a matter between an individual and God and should be done only with a desire to please Him. It loses its value when it is imposed from outside or displayed from a wrong motive.</p>
<p><strong>Lay Up Treasures in Heaven (6:19–21)<br />
</strong>This passage contains some of the most revolutionary teachings of our Lord—and some of the most neglected. The theme of the rest of the chapter is how to find security for the future.  In verses 19–21 Jesus contravenes all human advice to provide for a financially secure future. When He says, “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth,” He is indicating that there is no security in material things. Any type of material treasure on earth can be either destroyed by elements of nature (moth or rust) or stolen by thieves. Jesus says that the only investments not subject to loss are treasures in heaven.  This radical financial policy is based on the underlying principle that where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. If your money is in a safe-deposit box, then your heart and desire are also there. If your treasures are in heaven, your interests will be centered there.  This concept forces us to determine in our own life what the role of money is for us.  Is it a “treasure”, or merely a “tool” that God uses to accomplish His Will in our lives, and through us, in the lives of others?</p>
<p><strong>The Lamp Of The Body<br />
</strong>Jesus quotes a common proverb of the time and comments on it. If you have a “good eye.” This is in the Greek text, but the explanation is “if you are generous”, because in Judaism “having a good eye” means “being generous”, and “having a bad eye” means “being stingy.”</p>
<p><strong>You Cannot Serve God and Mammon (6:24)<br />
</strong>The impossibility of living for God and for money is stated here in terms of masters and slaves. No one can serve two masters. One will inevitably take precedence in his loyalty and obedience. So it is with God and mammon. They present rival claims and a choice must be made. Either we must put God first and reject the rule of materialism or we must live for temporal things and refuse God’s claim on our lives.   The word “Mammon” itself is a word that speaks of wealth; especially wealth that is used in opposition to God. Mammon is a transliteration of the Aramaic word mamon, which means “wealth, riches,” or “earthly goods.” It is related in ancient lore to a Babylonian deity of prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Worry (6:25–34)<br />
</strong>In this passage Jesus strikes at the tendency to center our lives around food and clothing, thus missing life’s real meaning.  Such worry is sin because it denies the love, wisdom, and power of God. It denies the love of God by implying that He doesn’t care for us. It denies His wisdom by implying that He doesn’t know what He is doing. And it denies His power by implying that He isn’t able to provide for our needs.</p>
<p>This type of worry causes us to devote our finest energies to making sure we will have enough to live on. Then before we know it, our lives have passed, and we have missed the central purpose for which we were made. God did not create us in His image with no higher destiny than that we should consume food. We are here to love, worship, and serve Him and to represent His interests on earth. Our bodies are intended to be our servants, not our masters.</p>
<p>The birds of the air illustrate God’s care for His creatures. They preach to us how unnecessary it is for us to worry. They neither sow nor reap, yet God feeds them. Since, in God’s hierarchy of creation, we are of more value than the birds, then we can surely expect God to take care of our needs.   But we should not infer from this that we need not work for the supply of our present needs. Paul reminds us: “If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat” (2 Thess. 3:10). Nor should we conclude that it is wrong for a farmer to sow, reap, and harvest. These activities are a necessary part of his providing for his current needs. What Jesus forbids here is multiplying barns in an attempt to provide future security independent of God (a practice He condemns in His story of the rich farmer in Luke 12:16–21.)</p>
<p>Worry about the future is not only a dishonor to God—it is also futile. The Lord demonstrates this with a question: “Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature?” A short person cannot worry himself eighteen inches taller. Yet, relatively speaking, it would be far easier to perform this feat than to worry into existence all the provisions for one’s future needs.</p>
<p>Next the Lord deals with the unreasonableness of worrying that we will not have enough clothing in the future. The lilies of the field neither toil nor spin, yet their beauty surpasses that of Solomon’s royal garments. If God can provide such elegant apparel for wildflowers, which have a brief existence and are then used as fuel in the baking oven, He will certainly care for His people who worship and serve Him.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that we should not spend our lives in anxious pursuit of food, drink, and clothing for the future. The unconverted Gentiles live for the mad accumulation of material things, as if food and clothing were the whole of life. But it should not be so with Christians, who have a heavenly Father who knows their basic needs.</p>
<p>If Christians were to set before them the goal of providing in advance for all their future needs, then their time and energy would have to be devoted to the accumulation of financial reserves. They could never be sure that they had saved enough, because there is always the danger of market collapse, inflation, catastrophe, prolonged illness, paralyzing accident. This means that God would be robbed of the service of His people. The real purpose for which they were created and converted would be missed. Men and women bearing the divine image would be living for an uncertain future on this earth when they should be living with eternity’s values in view.</p>
<p>The Lord, therefore, makes a covenant with His followers. He says, in effect, ”If you will put God’s interests first in your life, I will guarantee your future needs. If you seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, then I will see that you never lack the necessities of life.”   This is God’s “social security” program. The believer’s responsibility is to live for the Lord, trusting God for the future with unshakable confidence that He will provide. One’s job is simply a means of providing for current needs; everything above this is invested in the work of the Lord. We are called to live one day at a time: tomorrow can worry about its own things.</p>
<h5>LESSON 4 – The Sermon On The Mount, Part 4</h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 7<br />
</strong>1 “Judge not, that you be not judged. 2 For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. 3 And why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? 4 Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye’; and look, a plank is in your own eye? 5 Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.<br />
6 “Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces.<br />
7 “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. 8 For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. 9 Or what man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? 10 Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a serpent? 11 If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!<br />
12 Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.<br />
13 “Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. 14 Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it.<br />
15 “Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. 16 You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? 17 Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. 18 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. 19 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.<br />
20 Therefore by their fruits you will know them.<br />
21 “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. 22 Many will say to Me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?’ 23 And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!’ 24 “Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock: 25 and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. 26 “But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand: 27 and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall.”<br />
28 And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching, 29 for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.<br />
<strong>Do Not Judge (7:1–6)</strong><br />
This section on judging is one of the most misunderstood and misapplied portions of the New Testament.  Let’s see if we can clear some things up on this subject.  This command not to judge others includes the following areas:<br />
we should not judge motives, only God can read them;<br />
we should not judge by appearance (John 7:24; Jas. 2:1–4);<br />
we should not judge those who have conscientious scruples about matters that          <br />
     are not in themselves right or wrong (Rom. 14:1–5);<br />
we should not judge the service of another Christian (1 Cor. 4:1–5);<br />
we should not judge a fellow believer by speaking evil about him (Jas.4:11, 12).</p>
<p>Sometimes these words of our Lord are misconstrued by people to prohibit all forms of judgment. No matter what happens, they piously say, “Judge not, that you be not judged.” But Jesus is not teaching that we are to be undiscerning Christians. He never intended that we abandon our critical faculty or discernment. The NT has many illustrations of legitimate judgment of the condition, conduct, or teaching of others. In addition, there are several areas in which the Christian is commanded to make a decision, to discriminate between good and bad or between good and best. Some of these include:<br />
1. When disputes arise between believers, they should be settled in the church before members who can decide the matter (1 Cor. 6:1–8).<br />
2. The local church is to judge serious sins of its members and take appropriate action (Matt. 18:17; 1 Cor. 5:9–13).<br />
3. Believers are to judge the doctrinal teaching of teachers and preachers by the Word of God (Matt. 7:15–20; 1 Cor. 14:29; 1 Jn. 4:1).<br />
4. Christians have to discern if others are believers in order to obey Paul’s command in 2 Corinthians 6:14.<br />
5. Those in the church must judge which men have the qualifications necessary for elders and deacons (1 Tim. 3:1-13).<br />
6. We have to discern which people are unruly, fainthearted, weak, etc., and treat them according to the instructions in the Bible (e.g., 1 Thess. 5:14).</p>
<p>Jesus warned that unrighteous judgment would be repaid in kind: “For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged.” This principle of reaping what we sow is built into all human life and affairs. Mark applies the principle to our appropriation of the Word (4:24) and Luke applies it to our liberality in giving (6:38).</p>
<p>Jesus exposed our tendency to see a small fault in someone else while ignoring the same fault in ourselves. He purposely exaggerated the situation (using a figure of speech known as hyperbole) to drive home the point. Someone with a plank in his eye often finds fault with the speck in the eye of another, not even noticing his own condition. It is hypocritical to suppose that we could help someone with a fault when we ourselves have a greater fault. We must remedy our own faults before criticizing them in others.  Verse 6 proves that Jesus did not intend to forbid every kind of judgment. He warned His disciples not to give holy things to dogs or to cast pearls before swine. Under the Mosaic Law dogs and swine were unclean animals and here the terms are used to depict wicked people. When we meet vicious people who treat divine truths with utter contempt and respond to our preaching of the claims of Christ with abuse and violence, we are not obligated to continue to share the gospel with them. To press the matter only brings increased condemnation to the offenders.   Needless to say, it requires spiritual perception to discern these people. Perhaps that is why the next verses take up the subject of prayer, by which we can ask for wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Asking, Seeking, Knocking (7:7–12)<br />
</strong>If we think that we can live out the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount by our own strength, we have failed to realize the supernatural character of the life to which the Savior calls us. The wisdom or power for such a life must be given to us from above. So here we have an invitation to ask and keep on asking; to seek and keep on seeking; to knock and keep on knocking. Wisdom and power for the Christian life will be given to all who earnestly and persistently pray for it.<br />
Taken out of context, verses 7 and 8 might seem like a blank check for believers, i.e., we can get anything we ask for. But this is simply not true. The verses must be understood in their immediate context and in light of the whole Bible’s teaching on prayer. Therefore, what seems like unqualified promises here are actually restricted by other passages. For example, from Psalm 66:18 we learn that the person praying must have no unconfessed sin in his life. The Christian must pray in faith (Jas. 1:6–8) and in conformity with the will of God (1 Jn. 5:14). Prayer must be offered persistently (Luke 18:1–8) and sincerely (Heb. 10:22a).</p>
<p>When the conditions for prayer are met, the Christian can have utter confidence that God will hear and answer. This assurance is based on the character of God, our Father. On the human level, we know that if a son asks for bread, his father will not give him a stone. Neither would he give him a serpent if he had asked for a fish. An earthly father would neither deceive his hungry son nor give him anything that might inflict pain.  The Lord argues from the lesser to the greater. If human parents reward their children’s requests with what is best for them, how much more will our Father who is in heaven do so.</p>
<p>The immediate connection of verse 12 with the preceding seems to be this: since our Father is a giver of good things to us, we should imitate Him in showing kindness to others. The way to test whether an action is beneficial to others is whether we would want to receive it ourselves. The “Golden Rule” had been expressed in negative terms at least one hundred years before this time by Rabbi Hillel. However, by stating the rule in positive terminology, Jesus goes beyond passive restraint to active benevolence. Christianity is not simply a matter of abstinence from sin; it is positive goodness.</p>
<p>This saying by Jesus is the Law and the Prophets, that is, it summarizes the moral teachings of the Law of Moses and the writings of the Prophets of Israel. The righteousness demanded by the OT is fulfilled in converted believers who thus walk according to the Spirit (Rom. 8:4). If this verse were universally obeyed, it would transform all areas of international relationships, national politics, family life, and church life.</p>
<p><strong>The Narrow Way (7:13, 14)<br />
</strong>The Lord now warns that the gate of Christian discipleship is narrow and the way is difficult. But those who faithfully follow His teachings find the abundant life. On the other hand, there is the wide gate—the life of self-indulgence and pleasure. The end of such a life is destruction.   Jesus is saying that to follow Him would require faith, discipline, and endurance. But this difficult life is the only life worth living. If you choose the easy way, you will have plenty of company, but you will miss God’s best for you.</p>
<p><strong>By Their Fruits You Shall Know Them (7:15–20)<br />
</strong>Wherever the stern demands of true discipleship are taught, there are false prophets who advocate the wide gate and easy way. They water down the truth until, as C. H. Spurgeon said, “There is not enough left to make soup for a sick grasshopper.” These men who profess to be speaking for God come in sheep’s clothing, giving the appearance of being true believers. But inwardly they are ravenous wolves, i.e., they are vicious unbelievers who prey on the immature, the unstable, and the gullible.</p>
<p>Verses 16–18 deal with the detection of the false prophets: you will know them by their fruits. Their licentious lives and destructive teachings betray them. A tree or plant produces fruit according to its character. Thorn bushes cannot bear grapes; thistles do not bear figs. A good tree bears good fruit and a bad tree bears bad fruit. This principle is true in the natural world and in the spiritual world. The life and teaching of those who claim to speak for God should be tested by the Word of God: “If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them” (Isa. 8:20).<br />
The destiny of the false prophets is to be thrown into the fire. The doom of false teachers and prophets is “swift destruction” (2 Pet. 2:1). They can be known by their fruits.<br />
<strong>I Never Knew You (7:21–23)<br />
</strong>The Lord Jesus next warns against people who falsely profess to acknowledge Him as Savior, but have never been converted. Not everyone who calls Jesus, “Lord, Lord,” shall enter the kingdom of heaven. Only those who do the will of God enter the kingdom. The first step in doing the will of God is to believe on the Lord Jesus (John 6:29).   On judgment day when unbelievers stand before Christ (Rev. 20:11–15), many will remind Him that they prophesied, or cast out demons, or performed many wonders—all in His name. But their protestation will be in vain. Jesus will declare to them that He never knew them or acknowledged them as His own.</p>
<p>From these verses we learn that not all miracles are of divine origin and that not all miracle workers are divinely accredited. A miracle simply means that a supernatural power is at work. That power may be divine or satanic. Satan may empower his workers to cast out demons temporarily, in order to create the illusion that the miracle is divine. He is not dividing his kingdom against itself in such a case, but is plotting an even worse invasion of demons in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Build on the Rock (7:24–29)<br />
</strong>Jesus closes His sermon with a parable that drives home the importance of obedience. It is not enough to hear these sayings; we must put them into practice. The disciple who hears and does Jesus’ commands is like a wise man who built his house on the rock. His house (life) has a solid foundation and, when it is battered by rain and winds, it will not fall.</p>
<p>The person who hears Jesus’ sayings and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. This man will not be able to stand against the storms of adversity: when the rain descended and the winds blew, the house fell because it had no solid base.</p>
<p>If a person lives according to the principles of the Sermon on the Mount, the world calls him a fool; Jesus calls him a wise man. The world considers a wise man to be someone who lives by sight, who lives for the present, and who lives for self; Jesus calls such a person a fool. It is legitimate to use the wise and foolish builders to illustrate the gospel. The wise man puts his full confidence in the Rock, Christ Jesus, as Lord and Savior. The foolish man refuses to repent and rejects Jesus as his only hope of salvation. But the interpretation of the parable actually carries us beyond salvation to its practical outworking in the Christian life.<br />
As our Lord ended His message, the people were astonished. If we read the Sermon on the Mount and are not astonished at its revolutionary character, then we have failed to grasp its meaning.</p>
<h5>LESSON 5 – Matthew 8 – Miracles Proving Jesus’ Power (Authority)</h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 8<br />
</strong>1 When He had come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed Him. 2 And behold, a leper came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”  3 Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.  4 And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.”</p>
<p>5 Now when Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came to Him, pleading with Him, 6 saying, “Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, dreadfully tormented.”<br />
7 And Jesus said to him, “I will come and heal him.”  8 The centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But only speak a word, and my servant will be healed. 9 For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”  10 When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who followed, “Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel! 11 And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” 13 Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.” And his servant was healed that same hour.</p>
<p>18 And when Jesus saw great multitudes about Him, He gave a command to depart to the other side. 19 Then a certain scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”  20 And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”  21 Then another of His disciples said to Him, “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.”  22 But Jesus said to him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</p>
<p>23 Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him. 24 And suddenly a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered with the waves. But He was asleep. 25 Then His disciples came to Him and awoke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”  26 But He said to them, “Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?” Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 27 So the men marveled, saying, “Who can this be, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?”</p>
<p>28 When He had come to the other side, to the country of the Gergesenes, there met Him two demon-possessed men, coming out of the tombs, exceedingly fierce, so that no one could pass that way. 29 And suddenly they cried out, saying, “What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?”  30 Now a good way off from them there was a herd of many swine feeding. 31 So the demons begged Him, saying, “If You cast us out, permit us to go away into the herd of swine.”  32 And He said to them, “Go.” So when they had come out, they went into the herd of swine. And suddenly the whole herd of swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and perished in the water.  33 Then those who kept them fled; and they went away into the city and told everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men. 34 And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to depart from their region.</p>
<p><strong>Power Over Leprosy (8:1–4)<br />
</strong>A leper knelt before Jesus with a desperate appeal for healing. This leper had faith that the Lord could cure him, and true faith is never disappointed. Leprosy is an appropriate picture of sin because it is loathsome, destructive, infectious, and, in some forms, humanly incurable.   Lepers were untouchables. Physical contact with them might expose a person to infection. In the case of the Jews, this contact made the person ceremonially unclean, that is, unfit to worship with the congregation of Israel. But when Jesus touched the leper and spoke the healing words, the leprosy vanished immediately. Our Savior has power to cleanse from sin and to qualify the cleansed person to be a worshiper.</p>
<p>This is the first instance in Matthew’s Gospel where it is recorded that Jesus commanded someone to tell no one of the miracle done for them or of what they had seen (see also 9:30; 12:16; 17:9; Mark 5:43; 7:36; 8:26). This was probably because He was aware that many people, interested only in deliverance from the Roman yoke, wanted to make Him King. But He knew that Israel was still unrepentant, that the nation would reject His spiritual leadership, and that He must first go to the cross.</p>
<p>Under the Law of Moses, the priest also served as physician. When a leper was cleansed, he was obligated to bring an offering and to appear before the priest in order to be pronounced clean (Lev. 14:4–6). It was no doubt a rare event for a leper to be healed, so extraordinary, in fact, that it should have alerted this priest to investigate whether the Messiah had appeared at last. But we read of no such reaction. Jesus told the leper to obey the law in this matter.<br />
The spiritual implications of the miracle are clear: The Messiah had come to Israel with power to heal the nation of its illness. He presented this miracle as one of His credentials. But the nation was not yet ready for her Deliverer.<br />
Power Over Paralysis (8:5–13)</p>
<p>The faith of a Gentile centurion is introduced in striking contrast to the unreceptiveness of the Jews. If Israel will not acknowledge her King, the despised pagans will. The centurion was a Roman military officer in charge of about one hundred men, and was stationed in or near Capernaum. He came to Jesus to seek healing for his servant who had suffered a violent and painful paralysis. This was an unusual display of compassion—most officials would not have shown such concern for a servant.</p>
<p>Jesus marveled at the faith of this Gentile. This is one of two times when Jesus is said to have marveled; the other time was at the unbelief of the Jews (Mark 6:6). He had not found such great faith among God’s chosen people, Israel. This led Him to point out that in His coming kingdom, Gentiles would flock from all over the world to enjoy fellowship with the Jewish patriarchs while the sons of the kingdom would be thrown into outer darkness where they would weep and gnash their teeth. Sons of the kingdom are those who were Jews by birth, who professed to acknowledge God as King, but who were never truly converted. But the principle applies today. Many children privileged to be born and raised in Christian families will perish in hell because they reject Christ, while jungle savages will enjoy the eternal glories of heaven because they believed the gospel message.</p>
<p>Jesus said to the centurion, “Go your way; and as you have believed, so let it be done for you.” Faith is rewarded in proportion to its confidence in the character of God. The servant was healed instantly, even though Jesus was some distance away.</p>
<p><strong>The Miracle of Human Refusal (8:18–22)<br />
</strong>We have seen Christ exercising authority over disease and demons. It is only when He comes in contact with men and women that He meets with resistance—the miracle of human refusal.   As Jesus prepared to cross the Sea of Galilee from Capernaum to the east side, a self-confident scribe stepped forward pledging to follow Him “all the way.” The Lord’s answer challenged him to count the cost—a life of self-denial. “Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.” In His public ministry, He had no home of His own; however, there were homes where He was a welcome guest and He ordinarily had a place to sleep. The true force of His words seems to be spiritual: this world could not provide Him with true, lasting rest. He had a work to do and could not rest till it was accomplished. The same is true of His followers; this world is not their resting place—or at least, it shouldn’t be!   Another well-meaning follower expressed a willingness to follow Him, but had a higher priority: “Lord, let me first go and bury my father.” Most commentators indicate that the man’s father had not died yet, but that his words were rally a plea to avoid family strife by waiting until his father did die before openly following Jesus.  The basic trouble was expressed in the contradictory words: “Lord &#8230; me first.” He put self ahead of Christ.</p>
<p>Jesus answered him, in effect: “Your first duty is to follow Me. Let the spiritually dead bury the physically dead. An unsaved person can do that kind of work. But there is a work which you alone can do. Give the best of your life to what really lasts. Don’t waste it on trivia.” We are not told how these two disciples responded. But the strong implication is that they left Christ to make a comfortable place for themselves in the world.  However, before we condemn them, we should test ourselves on the two terms of discipleship enunciated by Jesus in this passage.</p>
<p><strong>Power Over the Elements (8:23–27)<br />
</strong>The Sea of Galilee is noted for sudden, violent storms that whip it into a churning froth. Winds sweep down the valley of the Jordan from the north, picking up speed in the narrow gorge. When they hit the Sea, it becomes extremely unsafe for navigation.   On this occasion, Jesus was crossing from the west side to the east. When the storm broke, He was asleep in the boat. The terrified disciples awoke Him with frantic pleas for help.  After rebuking them for their puny faith, He rebuked the winds and the waves. When a great calm descended, the men marveled that even the elements obeyed Jesus. How little they comprehended that the Creator and Sustainer of the universe was in the ship that day!</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Heals Two Demon-Possessed Men (8:28–34)<br />
</strong>On the east side of the Sea of Galilee was the country of the Gergesenes. When Jesus arrived, He met two unusually violent cases of demon possession. These demoniacs lived in cave-like tombs and were so fierce they made travel in that area unsafe.   As Jesus approached, the demons cried out, “What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?” They knew who Jesus was, and that He would finally destroy them. In these respects their theology was more accurate than that of many modern liberals. Sensing that Jesus was going to cast them out of the men, they asked that they might be transferred to a herd of many swine feeding nearby.</p>
<p>Strangely enough Jesus grant ed their request. But why should the Sovereign Lord accede to the request of demons? To understand His action, we must remember two facts. First, demons shun the disembodied state; they want to indwell human beings, or, if that is not possible, animals or other creatures. Secondly, the purpose of demons is without exception to destroy. If Jesus had simply cast them out of the maniacs, the demons would have been a menace to the other people of the area. By allowing them to go into the swine, He prevented their entering men and women and confined their destructive power to animals. It was not yet time for their final destruction by the Lord. As soon as the transfer took place, the swine ran violently down the steep place into the sea and drowned.  This incident demonstrates that the ultimate aim of demons is to destroy, and underlines the terrifying possibility that two men can be indwelt by the number of demons it takes to destroy two thousand swine (Mark 5:13).</p>
<p>The herdsmen ran back with news of what had happened. The result was that an aroused citizenry came out to Jesus and begged Him to leave the area.  If these Gergesenes were Jews, it was unlawful for them to raise pigs. But whether or not they were Jews, their condemnation is that they valued a herd of pigs more than the healing of two demoniacs.</p>
<h5>LESSON 6 – Matthew  9</h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 9<br />
</strong>1 So He got into a boat, crossed over, and came to His own city. 2 Then behold, they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you.”<br />
3 And at once some of the scribes said within themselves, “This Man blasphemes!”<br />
4 But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts? 5 For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise and walk’? 6 But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins”—then He said to the paralytic, “Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.” 7 And he arose and departed to his house.</p>
<p>9 As Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, “Follow Me.” So he arose and followed Him.<br />
10 Now it happened, as Jesus sat at the table in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Him and His disciples. 11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”<br />
12 When Jesus heard that, He said to them, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. 13 But go and learn what this means: ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.”</p>
<p>14 Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?”<br />
15 And Jesus said to them, “Can the friends of the bridegroom mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast. 16 No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for the patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear is made worse. 17 Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins break, the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”</p>
<p>18 While He spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshiped Him, saying, “My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her and she will live.” 19 So Jesus arose and followed him, and so did His disciples.<br />
20 And suddenly, a woman who had a flow of blood for twelve years came from behind and touched the hem of His garment. 21 For she said to herself, “If only I may touch His garment, I shall be made well.” 22 But Jesus turned around, and when He saw her He said, “Be of good cheer, daughter; your faith has made you well.” And the woman was made well from that hour.<br />
23 When Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd wailing, 24 He said to them, “Make room, for the girl is not dead, but sleeping.” And they ridiculed Him. 25 But when the crowd was put outside, He went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. 26 And the report of this went out into all that land.</p>
<p>27 When Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed Him, crying out and saying, “Son of David, have mercy on us!”<br />
28 And when He had come into the house, the blind men came to Him. And Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?”<br />
They said to Him, “Yes, Lord.”<br />
29 Then He touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be to you.” 30 And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one knows it.” 31 But when they had departed, they spread the news about Him in all that country.</p>
<p>36 But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd. 37 Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest truly is plentiful, but the laborers are few. 38 Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest.”<br />
<strong>Power to Forgive Sins (9:1–8)<br />
</strong>Rejected by the Gergesenes, the Savior recrossed the Sea of Galilee and came to Capernaum, which had become His own city after the people of Nazareth attempted to destroy Him (Luke 4:29–31). It was here that He performed some of His mightiest miracles.<br />
Four men came to Him, carrying a paralytic on a crude bed or mat. Mark’s account tells us that because of the crowd, they had to tear up the roof and lower the man into Jesus’ presence (2:1–12). When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, be of good cheer; your sins are forgiven you.” Notice that He saw their faith. Faith prompted the men to bring the invalid to Jesus, and the invalid’s faith went out to Jesus for healing. Our Lord first rewarded this faith by pronouncing his sins forgiven. The Great Physician removed the cause before treating the symptoms; He gave the greater blessing first.</p>
<p>When some of the scribes heard Jesus declare the man’s sins forgiven, they accused Him of blasphemy within themselves. After all, only God can forgive sins—and they were certainly not about to receive Him as God! The omniscient Lord Jesus read their thoughts, rebuked them for the evil in their hearts of unbelief, then asked them whether it was easier to say, “Your sins are forgiven you,” or to say, “Arise and walk.” Actually it’s as easy to say one as the other, but which is easier to do? Both are humanly impossible, but the results of the first command are not visible whereas the effects of the second are immediately discernible.   In order to show the scribes that He had authority on earth to forgive sins (and should therefore be honored as God), Jesus gave them a miracle they could see. Turning to the paralytic, He said, “Arise, take up your bed and go to your house.”  The visible healing of the paralytic was designed to confirm that the man’s sins had been forgiven, an invisible miracle. From this they should have realized that what they had witnessed was not a demonstration of God giving authority to men but of God’s presence among them in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. But they didn’t understand.</p>
<p>Jesus Calls Matthew the Tax Collector (9:9–13)<br />
The tense atmosphere building up around the Savior is temporarily relieved by Matthew’s simple and humble account of his own call. A tax-collector or custom house officer, he and his fellow officials were hated intensely by the Jews because of their crookedness, because of the oppressive taxes they exacted, and most of all, because they served the interests of the Roman Empire, Israel’s invaders. As Jesus passed the tax office, He said to Matthew, “Follow Me.” The response was instantaneous; he arose and followed; leaving a traditionally dishonest job to become an instant disciple of Jesus.</p>
<p>The meal described here was arranged by Matthew in honor of Jesus (Luke 5:29). It was his way of confessing Christ publicly and of introducing his associates to the Savior. Necessarily, therefore, the guests were tax-collectors and others generally known to be sinners!  It was the practice in those days to eat reclining on couches and facing the table. When the Pharisees saw Jesus associating in this way with the social riff-raff, they went to His disciples and charged Him with “guilt by association”; surely no true prophet would eat with sinners!   Jesus overheard and answered, “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.” The Pharisees considered themselves healthy and were unwilling to confess their need for Jesus. (Actually they were extremely ill spiritually and desperately needed healing.) The tax collectors and sinners, by contrast, were more willing to acknowledge their true condition and to seek Christ’s saving grace. So the charge was true! Jesus did eat with sinners. If He had eaten with the Pharisees, the charge would still have been true—perhaps even more so! If Jesus hadn’t eaten with sinners in a world like ours, He would always have eaten alone. But it is important to remember that when He ate with sinners, He never indulged in their evil ways or compromised His testimony. He used the occasion to call men to truth and holiness.</p>
<p>The Pharisees’ trouble was that although they followed the rituals of Judaism with great precision, their hearts were hard, cold, and merciless. So Jesus dismissed them with a challenge to learn the meaning of Jehovah’s words, “I desire mercy, and not sacrifice” (quoted from Hosea 6:6). Although God had instituted the sacrificial system, He did not want the rituals to become a substitute for inward righteousness. God is not a Ritualist, and He is not pleased with rituals divorced from personal godliness—precisely what the Pharisees had done. They observed the letter of the law but had no compassion for those who needed spiritual help. They associated only with self-righteous people like themselves.   In contrast, the Lord Jesus pointedly told them, “I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.” He perfectly fulfilled God’s desire for mercy as well as sacrifice. In one sense, there are no righteous people in the world, so He came to call all men to repentance. But here the thought is that His call is only effective for those who acknowledge themselves to be sinners. He can dispense no healing to those who are proud, self-righteous, and unrepentant—like the Pharisees.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Is Questioned About Fasting (9:14–17)</strong><br />
By this time John the Baptist was in prison. His disciples came to Jesus with a problem. They themselves fasted often, but Jesus’ disciples did not. Why not?<br />
The Lord answered with an illustration. He was the bridegroom and His disciples the wedding guests. As long as He was with them, there was no reason to fast as a sign of mourning. But He would be taken from them; then His disciples would fast. He was taken from them—in death and burial, and since His ascension He has been bodily absent from His disciples. While Jesus’ words do not command fasting, they certainly approve it as an appropriate exercise for those who await the Bridegroom’s return.</p>
<p>The question raised by John’s disciples further prompted Jesus to point out that John marked the end of one dispensation, announcing the new Age of Grace, and He shows that their respective principles cannot be mixed. To try to mix law and grace would be like using a piece of new, unshrunk cloth to patch an old garment. When washed, the patch would shrink, ripping itself away from the old cloth.  Or the mixture would be like putting new wine into old wineskins. The pressure caused by the fermentation of the new wine would burst the old skins because they had lost their elasticity. The life and liberty of the Gospel ruins the wineskins of ritualism.</p>
<p>Power to Heal the Incurable and Raise the Dead (9:18–26)<br />
Jesus’ discourse on the change of dispensations was interrupted by a distraught ruler of the synagogue whose daughter had just died. He knelt before the Lord, requesting Him to come and restore her to life. It was exceptional that this ruler should seek help from Jesus; most of the Jewish leaders would have feared the scorn and contempt of their associates for doing so. Jesus honored his faith by starting out with His disciples toward the ruler’s home.<br />
Another interruption! This time it was a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years. Jesus was never annoyed by such interruptions; He was always poised, accessible, and approachable.  Medical science had been unable to help this woman; in fact, her condition was deteriorating (Mark 5:26). In her extremity she met Jesus—or at least she saw Him surrounded by a crowd. Believing that He was able and willing to heal her, she edged through the crowd and touched the fringe (tzit-tzit) of His prayer shawl. True faith never goes unnoticed by Him. He turned and pronounced her healed; instantly the woman was made well for the first time in twelve years.</p>
<p>The narrative now returns to the ruler whose daughter had died. When Jesus reached the house, the professional mourners were wailing with what someone has called “synthetic grief.” He ordered the room cleared of visitors, at the same time announcing that the girl was not dead but sleeping.  The Lord took the girl by the hand and the miracle occurred—she got up. It didn’t take long for the news of the miracle to spread throughout the district.</p>
<p><strong>Power to Give Sight (9:27–31)</strong><br />
As Jesus departed from the ruler’s neighborhood, two blind men followed Him, pleading for sight. Though dispossessed of natural vision, these men had acute spiritual discernment. In addressing Jesus as Son of David, they recognized Him as the long-awaited Messiah and rightful King of Israel. And they knew that when the Messiah came, one of His credentials would be that He would give sight to the blind (Isa. 42:6-7). When Jesus tested their faith by asking if they believed He was able to do this (give them sight), they unhesitatingly responded, “Yes, Lord.”  Then the Great Physician touched their eyes and assured them that because they believed, they would see. Immediately their eyes became completely normal.  Man says, “Seeing is believing.” God says, “Believing is seeing.”  He wants us to believe Him simply because He is God.</p>
<p>Why did Jesus sternly warn the healed men to tell no one? He did not want to start a premature movement to enthrone Him as King. The people were as yet unrepentant; He could not reign over them until they were born again.  In their  gratitude for eyesight, the two men spread the news of their miraculous cure. While we might be tempted to sympathize, and even to admire their exuberant testimony, the hard fact is that they were crassly disobedient and inevitably did more harm than good, probably by stirring up shallow curiosity rather than Spirit-inspired interest. Not even gratitude is a valid excuse for disobedience.</p>
<p><strong>The Need for Harvest Workers (9:36–38)</strong><br />
Jesus traveled throughout the cities and villages, preaching the good news of the kingdom, namely, that He was the King of Israel, and that if the nation repented and acknowledged Him, He would reign over them. A bona fide offer of the kingdom was made to Israel at this time. What would have happened if Israel had responded? The Bible does not answer the question. We do know that Christ would still have had to die to provide a righteous basis by which God could justify sinners of all ages.</p>
<p>As He gazed on Israel’s multitudes, harassed and helpless, He saw them as sheep without a shepherd. His great heart of compassion went out to them. A great work of spiritual harvest needed to be done, but the laborers were few. The problem has persisted to this day, it seems; the need is always greater than the work-force.  The Lord Jesus told the disciples to ask the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into His harvest. Notice here that the need does not constitute a call. Workers should not go until they are sent.</p>
<h5>LESSON 7 – Matthew  10</h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 10:5-42<br />
</strong>5 These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: “Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans. 6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. 7 And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ 8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. 9 Provide neither gold nor silver nor copper in your money belts, 10 nor bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staffs; for a worker is worthy of his food.<br />
11 “Now whatever city or town you enter, inquire who in it is worthy, and stay there till you go out. 12 And when you go into a household, greet it. 13 If the household is worthy, let your peace come upon it. But if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. 14 And whoever will not receive you nor hear your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. 15 Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!<br />
16 “Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves. 17 But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues. 18 You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles. 19 But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; 20 for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.<br />
21 “Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death. 22 And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved. 23 When they persecute you in this city, flee to another. For assuredly, I say to you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.<br />
24 “A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. 25 It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household! 26 Therefore do not fear them. For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed, and hidden that will not be known.<br />
27 “Whatever I tell you in the dark, speak in the light; and what you hear in the ear, preach on the housetops. 28 And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will. 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.<br />
32 “Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven. 33 But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven.<br />
34 “Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword. 35 For I have come to ‘set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law’; 36 and ‘a man’s enemies will be those of his own household.’ 37 He who loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me. And he who loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me. 38 And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. 39 He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.<br />
40 “He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who sent Me. 41 He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward. And he who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward. 42 And whoever gives one of these little ones only a cup of cold water in the name of a disciple, assuredly, I say to you, he shall by no means lose his reward.”<br />
<strong>The Mission to Israel (10:5–33)<br />
</strong>The bulk of this chapter contains Jesus’ instructions concerning a special preaching tour to the house of Israel. This is not to be confused with the later sending of the seventy (Luke 10:1) or with the Great Commission (Matt. 28:19, 20). This was a temporary mission with the specific purpose of announcing that the kingdom of heaven was near. While some of the principles are of lasting value for God’s people in all ages, the fact that some were later revoked by the Lord Jesus proves they were not intended to be permanent (Luke 22:35, 36).<br />
First the route is given. They were not to go to the Gentiles or to the Samaritans. Their ministry was limited at this time to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.  The message was the proclamation that the kingdom of heaven was at hand. If Israel refused, there would be no excuse because an official announcement was to be made exclusively to them. The kingdom had drawn near in the Person of the King. Israel must decide whether to accept or reject Him.  The disciples were given credentials to confirm their message. They were to heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out demons. The Jews demanded signs (1 Cor. 1:22) so God graciously condescended to give them signs.   As to remuneration, the Lord’s representatives were to make no charge for their services. They had received their blessings without cost and were to dispense them on the same basis.  What arrangements were they to make for housing? When they entered a city, they were to look for a worthy host—one who would receive them as disciples of the Lord and who would be open to their message. Once they found such a host, they were to stay with him as long as they were in the city, rather than moving if they found more favorable living conditions.<br />
 <br />
Starting in verse 16, Jesus counsels the twelve concerning their behavior in the face of persecution. They would be like sheep in the midst of wolves, surrounded by vicious men bent on destroying them. They should be wise as serpents, avoiding giving needless offense or being tricked into compromising situations. And they should be harmless as doves, protected by the armor of a righteous character and faith unfeigned.  They should be on guard against unbelieving Jews who would take them into criminal courts and flog them in their synagogues. The attack against them would be both civil and religious.   They would be dragged before governors and kings for Christ’s sake. But God’s cause would triumph over man’s evil.  In their hour of seeming defeat the disciples would have the incomparable privilege of testifying before rulers and Gentiles. God would be working all things together for good.</p>
<p>They need not rehearse what they would say when on trial. When the time came, the Spirit of God would give them divine wisdom to answer in such a way as to glorify Christ and utterly confuse and frustrate their accusers. Two extremes should be avoided in interpreting verse 19. The first is the naive assumption that a Christian never needs to prepare a message in advance. The second is the view that the verse has no relevance for us today. It is proper and desirable for a preacher to prayerfully wait before God for the appropriate word for a specific occasion. But it is also true that in crises, all believers can claim God’s promise to give them wisdom to speak with divine intuition. They become mouthpieces for the Spirit of their Father.</p>
<p>Jesus forewarned His disciples that they would have to face treachery and betrayal. Brother would accuse brother. Father would betray his child. Children would become informers against their parents, resulting in the execution of the parents.  The disciples would be hated by all—not by all without exception, but by all cultures, nationalities, classes, etc., of men. “But he who endures to the end will be saved.” Taken by itself, this could seem to imply that salvation can be earned by steadfast endurance. We know it cannot mean this because throughout the Scriptures salvation is presented as a free gift of God’s grace through faith (Eph. 2:8, 9). Neither can the verse mean that those who remain faithful to Christ will be saved from physical death; the previous verse predicts the death of some faithful disciples. The simplest explanation is that endurance is the hallmark of the genuinely saved. Those who endure to the end in times of persecution show by their perseverance that they are true believers.</p>
<p>In Bible passages dealing with the future, the Spirit of God often shifts from the immediate future to the distant future. A prophecy may have a partial and immediate significance and also a complete and more distant fulfillment.  In verses 22 and 23 the Lord Jesus makes this kind of prophetic transition. He warns the twelve disciples of the sufferings they will undergo for His sake, then He seems to see them as a type of His devoted followers during the Great Tribulation. He leaps forward from the trials of the first Christians to those of believers prior to His Second Advent.</p>
<p>The disciples of the Lord would often have occasion to wonder why they should have to endure ill treatment. If Jesus was the Messiah, why were His followers suffering instead of reigning? In verses 24 and 25, He anticipates their perplexity and answers it by reminding them of their relationship to Him. They were the disciples; He was their Teacher. They were servants; He was their Master. They were members of the household; He was the Master of the house. Discipleship means following the Teacher, not being superior to Him. The servant should not expect to be treated better than his Master. If men call the worthy Master of the house “Beelzebub” (“lord of flies,” an Ekronite god whose name was used by Jews for Satan), they will hurl even greater insults at the members of His household. Discipleship involves sharing the Master’s rejection.</p>
<p>Three times the Lord told His followers not to fear (vv. 26, 28, 31). First, they should not fear the seeming victory of their foes; His cause would be gloriously vindicated in a coming day.</p>
<p>Second, the disciples should not fear the murderous rage of men. The worst that men can do is kill the body. Physical death is not the supreme tragedy for the Christian. To die is to be with Christ and thus far better. It is deliverance from sin, sorrow, sickness, suffering, and death; and it is translation into eternal glory. So the worst men can do is, in a real sense, the best thing that can happen to the child of God.<br />
 <br />
In the midst of fiery trials, the disciples could be confident of God’s care. The Lord Jesus teaches this from the sparrow. Two of these insignificant birds were sold for a copper coin. Yet not one of them dies outside the Father’s will, without His knowledge or His presence.   The same God who takes a personal interest in the tiny sparrow keeps an accurate count of the hairs of the head of each of His children. A strand of hair is of considerably less value than a sparrow. This shows that His people are of more value to Him than many sparrows, so why should they fear?</p>
<p>In view of the foregoing considerations, what is more reasonable than that the disciples of Christ should fearlessly confess Him before men? Any shame or reproach they might bear will be abundantly rewarded in heaven when the Lord Jesus confesses them before His Father. Confession of Christ here involves commitment to Him as Lord and Savior and the resulting acknowledgment of Him by life and by lips. In the case of most of the twelve, this led to the ultimate confession of the Lord in martyrdom.</p>
<p>Denial of Christ on earth will be repaid with denial before God in heaven. To deny Christ in this sense means to refuse to recognize His claims over one’s life. Those whose lives say, in effect, “I never knew You” will hear Him say at last, “I never knew you.” The Lord is not referring to a temporary denial of Him under pressure, as in Peter’s case, but to that kind of denial that is habitual and final.</p>
<p><strong>Not Peace But a Sword (10:34–39)<br />
</strong>Our Lord’s words must be understood as a figure of speech in which the visible results of His coming are stated as the apparent purpose of His coming. He says He did not come to bring peace but a sword. Actually He did come to make peace (Eph. 2:14–17); He came that the world might be saved through Him (John 3:17).   But the point here is that whenever individuals became His followers, their families would turn against them. A converted father would be opposed by his unbelieving son, a Christian mother by her unsaved daughter. A born again mother-in-law would be hated by her unregenerate daughter-in-law. So a choice must often be made between Christ and family. No ties of nature can be allowed to deflect a disciple from utter allegiance to the Lord. The Savior must take precedence over father, mother, son or daughter. One of the costs of discipleship is to experience tension, strife, and alienation from one’s own family. This hostility is often more bitter than is encountered in other areas of life.</p>
<p>But there is something even more apt to rob Christ of His rightful place than family—that is, the love of one’s own life. So Jesus added, “And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.” The cross, of course, was a means of execution. To take the cross and follow Christ means to live in such devoted abandonment to Him that even death itself is not too high a price to pay. Not all disciples are required to lay down their lives for the Lord, but all are called on to value Him so highly that they do not count their lives precious to themselves.   Love of Christ must overmaster the instinct of self-preservation. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for Christ’s sake will find it. The temptation is to hug one’s life by trying to avoid the pain and loss of a life of total commitment. But this is the greatest waste of a life—to spend it in the gratification of self. The greatest use of a life is to spend it in the service of Christ. The person who loses his life in devotedness to Him will find it in its true fullness.<br />
<strong>A Cup of Cold Water (10:40–42)<br />
</strong>Not everyone would refuse the disciples’ message. Some would recognize them as representatives of the Messiah and receive them graciously. The disciples would have limited ability to reward such kindness, but they need not fret; anything done for them would be reckoned as being done for the Lord Himself and would be rewarded accordingly.  To receive Christ’s disciple would be tantamount to receiving Christ Himself, and to receive Him was the same as receiving the Father who sent Him, since the one sent represents the sender. To receive an ambassador, who stands in the place of the government that commissions him, is to enjoy diplomatic relations with his country.</p>
<p>Anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward.  One who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward. Those who judge others by physical attractiveness or material affluence fail to realize that true moral worth is often cloaked in very humble guise. The way a man treats the most homespun disciple is the way he treats the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>No kindness shown to a follower of Jesus will go unnoticed. Even a cup of cold water will be grandly rewarded if it is given to a disciple because he is a follower of the Lord.   Thus the Lord closes His special charge to the twelve by investing them with regal dignity. It is true that they would be opposed, rejected, arrested, tried, imprisoned, and perhaps even killed. But let them never forget that they were representatives of the King and that their glorious privilege was to speak and act for Him.</p>
<h5>LESSON 8 – Matthew  11 </h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 11:2-19, 20-30<br />
</strong>2 And when John had heard in prison about the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples 3 and said to Him, “Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?”<br />
4 Jesus answered and said to them, “Go and tell John the things which you hear and see: 5 The blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them. 6 And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.”<br />
7 As they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? 8 But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed, those who wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses. 9 But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. 10 For this is he of whom it is written: ‘Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, Who will prepare Your way before You.’<br />
11 “Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. 12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force. 13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 14 And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come. 15 He who has ears to hear, let him hear!<br />
16 “But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their companions, 17 and saying: ‘We played the flute for you, And you did not dance; We mourned to you, And you did not lament.’<br />
18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Look, a glutton and a winebibber, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom is justified by her children.”</p>
<p>20 Then He began to rebuke the cities in which most of His mighty works had been done, because they did not repent: 21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. 22 But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you. 23 And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. 24 But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.”  25 At that time Jesus answered and said, “I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes. 26 Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight. 27 All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him. 28 Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”<br />
<strong>John the Baptist Imprisoned (11:1–19)<br />
</strong>Having sent the twelve on the special temporary mission to the house of Israel, Jesus departed from there to teach and to preach in the cities of Galilee where the disciples had previously lived.  By now John had been imprisoned by Herod. Discouraged and lonely, he began to wonder. If Jesus were truly the Messiah, why did He allow His forerunner to languish in prison? Like many great men of God, John suffered a temporary lapse of faith. So he sent two of his disciples to ask if Jesus really was the One the prophets had promised, or if they should still be looking for the Anointed One.</p>
<p>Jesus answered by reminding John that He was performing the miracles predicted of the Messiah: The blind see (Isa. 35:5); the lame walk (Isa. 35:6); lepers are cleansed (Isa. 53:4, cf. Matt. 8:16, 17); the deaf hear (Isa. 35:5); the dead are raised up (although not specifically prophesied of the Messiah; it was a miracle that proclaimed Jesus as God).  Jesus also reminded John that the gospel was being preached to the poor in fulfillment of the Messianic prophecy in Isaiah 61:1. Ordinary religious leaders often concentrate their attention on the wealthy and aristocratic. The Messiah brought good news to the poor.</p>
<p>Then the Savior added, “And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.” His gentleness, lowliness, and humiliation were out of character with the prevailing image of the militant Messiah. Men who were guided by fleshly desires might doubt His claim to kingship. But God’s blessing would rest on those who, by spiritual insight, recognized Jesus of Nazareth as the promised Messiah.  Verse 6 should not be interpreted as a rebuke to John the Baptist. Everyone’s faith needs to be confirmed and strengthened at times. It is one thing to have a temporary lapse of faith and quite another to be permanently stumbled as to the true identity of the Lord Jesus. No single chapter is the story of a man’s life. Taking John’s life in its totality, we find a record of faithfulness and perseverance.</p>
<p>As soon as John’s disciples departed with Jesus’ words of reassurance, the Lord turned to the multitudes with words of glowing praise for the Baptist.  John was a fearless preacher, an embodied conscience, who would rather suffer than be silent, and rather die than lie. John was a simple man of God whose austere life was a rebuke to the enormous worldliness of the people.<br />
John was a prophet—in fact, the greatest of the prophets. The Lord did not imply here that he was greater as to his personal character, eloquence, or persuasiveness; he was greater because of his position as forerunner of the Messiah-King.  This is made clear in verse 10; John was the fulfillment of Malachi’s prophecy (3:1)—the messenger who would precede the Lord and prepare the people for His coming. Other men had prophesied the Coming of Christ, but John was the one chosen to announce His actual arrival.  The statement that “he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he” proves that Jesus was speaking of John’s privilege, not his character. A person who is least in the kingdom of heaven does not necessarily have a better character than John, but he does have greater privilege.</p>
<p>From the opening of John’s ministry to his present imprisonment the kingdom of heaven had suffered violence. The Pharisees and scribes had vigorously opposed it. Herod the king had done his part to buffet the kingdom by seizing its herald.   “&#8230; And the violent take it by force.” This statement is capable of two interpretations. First, the foes of the kingdom did their best to take the kingdom in order to destroy it. Their rejection of John foreshadowed the rejection of the King Himself and thus of the kingdom. But it may also mean that those who were ready for the King’s advent responded vigorously to the announcement and strained every muscle to enter. This is the meaning in Luke 16:16: “The law and the prophets were until John. Since that time the kingdom of God has been preached, and every one is pressing into it.” Here the kingdom is pictured as a besieged city, with all classes of men hammering at it from the outside, trying to get in.  Whichever meaning one adopts, the thought is that John’s preaching touched off a violent reaction, with widespread and deep effects.</p>
<p>But the generation to whom Jesus was speaking was not interested in accepting either. The Jews who were privileged to see the Advent of their Messiah had no desire for Him or His forerunner.  Jesus compared them to peevish children sitting in the marketplaces who refused to be satisfied with any overtures. If their friends wanted to pipe so they could dance, they refused. If their friends wanted to play-act a funeral, they refused to cry.  John came as an ascetic, and the Jews accused him of being demon-possessed. The Son of Man, on the other hand, ate and drank in a normal manner. If John’s asceticism made them uncomfortable, then surely they would be pleased with Jesus’ more ordinary eating habits. But no! They called Him a glutton, a drunkard, a friend of tax-collectors and sinners. Of course, Jesus never ate or drank to excess; their charge was a total fabrication. It is true that He was a friend of tax-collectors and sinners, but not in the way they meant. He befriended sinners in order to save them from their sins, but He never shared or approved their sins.<br />
<strong>Woes on the Unrepentant Cities of Galilee (11:20–24)<br />
</strong>Great privilege brings great responsibility. No cities were ever more privileged than Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum. The incarnate Son of God had walked their streets, taught their people, and performed most of His mighty miracles within their walls. In the face of this overwhelming evidence, they had stubbornly refused to repent. Little wonder, then, that the Lord should pronounce doom upon them.  He began with Chorazin and Bethsaida. These cities had heard the gracious call of their Savior, yet willfully turned Him away. His mind reverted to the cities of Tyre and Sidon which had fallen under the judgment of God because of their idolatry and wickedness. If they had been privileged to see the miracles of Jesus, they would have humbled themselves in deepest repentance. In the day of judgment, therefore, Tyre and Sidon would fare better than Chorazin and Bethsaida. </p>
<p>Few cities had been as favored as Capernaum. It became Jesus’ home town after His rejection at Nazareth (9:1, cf. Mark 2:1–12), and some of His most extraordinary miracles—irrefutable evidences of His Messiah-ship—were performed there. Had vile Sodom, the capital of homosexuality, been so privileged, it would have repented and been spared. But Capernaum’s privilege was greater. Its people should have repented and gladly acknowledged the Lord. But Capernaum missed its day of opportunity. Sodom’s sin of perversion was great. But no sin is greater than Capernaum’s rejection of the holy Son of God. Therefore, Sodom will not be punished as severely as Capernaum in the day of judgment. Lifted up to heaven in privilege, Capernaum will be brought down to Hades in judgment. If this is true of Capernaum, how much truer of places where Bibles abound, where the gospel is broadcast, and where few, if any, are without excuse.</p>
<p>In the days of our Lord, there were four prominent cities in Galilee: Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, and Tiberias. He pronounced woes against the first three but not Tiberias. What has been the result? The destruction of Chorazin and Bethsaida is so complete that their exact sites are unknown. The location of Capernaum is not positive. Tiberias still stands. This remarkable fulfillment of prophecy is one more evidence of the Savior’s omniscience and the Bible’s inspiration.</p>
<p>The Savior’s Reaction to Rejection (11:25–30)<br />
The three cities of Galilee had neither eyes to see nor heart to love the Christ of God. He knew their attitude was but a foretaste of rejection on a wider scale. How did He react to their impenitance? Not with bitterness, cynicism, or vindictiveness. Rather He lifted His voice in thanks to God that nothing could frustrate His sovereign purposes. “I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes.”</p>
<p>We should avoid two possible misunderstandings. First, Jesus was not expressing pleasure in the inevitable judgment of the Galilean cities. Secondly, He did not imply that God had high-handedly withheld the light from the wise and prudent.  The cities had every chance to welcome the Lord Jesus. They deliberately refused to submit to Him. When they refused the light, God withheld the light from them. But God’s plans will not fail.</p>
<p>Those who consider themselves too wise and understanding to need Christ become afflicted with judicial blindness. But those who admit their lack of wisdom receive a revelation of Him “in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (Col. 2:3). Jesus thanked the Father for ordaining that if some would not have Him, others would. In the face of heart-breaking unbelief He found consolation in the overruling plan and purpose of God.</p>
<p>“Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son and he to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.” Ultimately, only God is great enough to understand God. Man cannot know Him by his own strength or intellect. But the Lord Jesus can and does reveal the Father to those whom He chooses. Whoever comes to know the Son comes to know the Father also (John 14:7).   To come means to believe (Acts 16:31); to receive (John 1:12); to eat (John 6:35); to drink (John 7:37); to look (Isa. 45:22); to confess (1 Jn. 4:2); to hear (John 5:24, 25); to enter a door (John 10:9); to open a door (Rev. 3:20); to touch the hem of His garment (Matt. 9:20, 21); and to accept the gift of eternal life through Christ our Lord (Rom. 6:23).   The object of faith is not a church, a creed, or a clergyman, but the living Christ. Salvation is in a Person; Jesus.<br />
 <br />
In order to truly come to Jesus, a person must admit that he is burdened with the weight of sin. Only those who acknowledge they are lost can be saved. Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ is preceded by repentance toward God.</p>
<p>In verses 29 and 30, the invitation changes from salvation to service.<br />
Take My yoke upon you. This means to enter into submission to His will, to turn over control of one’s life to Him (Rom. 12:1, 2).  As we acknowledge His lordship in every area of our lives, He trains us in His ways.<br />
 <br />
“For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” Again there is a striking contrast with the Pharisees. Jesus said of them, “For they bind heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers” (Matt. 23:4). This does not mean that there are no problems, trials, labor, or heartaches in the Christian life. But it does mean that we do not have to bear them alone. We are yoked with One who gives sufficient grace for every time of need. To serve Him is not bondage but perfect freedom.</p>
<p>J. H. Jowett says:<br />
“The fatal mistake for the believer is to seek to bear life’s load in a single collar. God never intended a man to carry his burden alone. Christ therefore deals only in yokes! A yoke is a neck harness for two, and the Lord himself is One of the two. He shares the labor of any galling task. The secret of peace and victory in the Christian life is found in putting off the taxing collar of “self” and accepting the Master’s relaxing “yoke.”</p>
<h5>LESSON 9 – Matthew 12</h5>
<p>1 At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. 2 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!”<br />
3 But He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: 4 how he entered the house of God and ate the showbread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? 5 Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless? 6 Yet I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple. 7 But if you had known what this means, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the guiltless. 8 For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.”</p>
<p>9 Now when He had departed from there, He went into their synagogue. 10 And behold, there was a man who had a withered hand. And they asked Him, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”—that they might accuse Him.<br />
11 Then He said to them, “What man is there among you who has one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold of it and lift it out? 12 Of how much more value then is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” 13 Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and it was restored as whole as the other.</p>
<p>24 Now when the Pharisees heard it they said, “This fellow does not cast out demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.”<br />
25 But Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them: “Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. 26 If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? 27 And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. 28 But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you. 29 Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? And then he will plunder his house. 30 He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad.<br />
31 “Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men. 32 Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come.<br />
33 “Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit. 34 Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. 35 A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things. 36 But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgment. 37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”</p>
<p>38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered, saying, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from You.”<br />
39 But He answered and said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. 40 For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. 41 The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here. 42 The queen of the South will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and indeed a greater than Solomon is here.<br />
43 “When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. 44 Then he says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came.’ And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. 45 Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.”46 While He was still talking to the multitudes, behold, His mother and brothers stood outside, seeking to speak with Him. 47 Then one said to Him, “Look, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, seeking to speak with You.”<br />
48 But He answered and said to the one who told Him, “Who is My mother and who are My brothers?” 49 And He stretched out His hand toward His disciples and said, “Here are My mother and My brothers! 50 For whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”<br />
<strong>Jesus Is Lord of the Sabbath (12:1–8)<br />
</strong>This chapter records the mounting crisis of rejection. The rising anger and hatred of the Pharisees are now ready to spill over. The issue that opens the floodgates is the Sabbath question.  On this particular Sabbath, Jesus and His disciples were passing through the grainfields. His disciples began to pluck heads of grain and to eat them. The law permitted them to help themselves to grain from their neighbor’s field as long as they did not use a sickle (Deut. 23:25).   But the Pharisees, legal nitpickers, charged that the Sabbath had been broken. Though their specific charges are not stated it is likely that they accused the disciples of: (1) harvesting (picking the grain); (2) threshing (rubbing it in their hands); (3) winnowing (separating the grain from the chaff).</p>
<p>Jesus answered their ridiculous complaint by reminding them of an incident in the life of David. Once, when in exile, he and his men went into the wilderness and ate the showbread, twelve memorial loaves forbidden as food to any but the priests. Neither David nor his men were priests, yet God never found fault with them for doing this. Why not?  The reason is that God’s law was never intended to inflict hardship on His faithful people. It was not David’s fault that he was in exile. A sinful nation had rejected him. If he had been given his rightful place, he and his followers would not have had to eat the showbread. Because there was sin in Israel, God permitted an otherwise forbidden act.   The analogy is clear. The Lord Jesus was the rightful King of Israel, but the nation would not acknowledge Him as Sovereign. If He had been given His proper place, His followers would not have been reduced to eating in this way on the Sabbath or on any other day of the week. History was repeating itself. The Lord did not reprove His disciples, because they had done no wrong.</p>
<p>Jesus reminded the Pharisees that the priests profane the Sabbath by killing and sacrificing animals and by performing many other servile duties (Num. 28:9, 10), yet are blameless because they are engaged in the service of God.<br />
12:6 The Pharisees knew that the priests worked every Sabbath in the temple without desecrating it. Why then should they criticize the disciples for acting as they did in the presence of One who is greater than the temple?</p>
<p>The Pharisees had never understood the heart of God. In Hosea 6:6 He had said, “I desire mercy and not sacrifice.” God puts compassion before ritual. He would rather see His people picking grain on the Sabbath to satisfy their hunger than observing the day so strictly as to inflict physical distress. If the Pharisees had only realized this, they would not have condemned the disciples. But they valued outward “religion” above human welfare.</p>
<p>Then the Savior added, “For the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.” It was He who had instituted the law in the first place, and therefore He was the One most qualified to interpret its true meaning.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Jesus Heals on the Sabbath (12:9–13)<br />
</strong>From the grainfields Jesus went into the synagogue.  Inside the synagogue was a man who had a withered hand—mute testimony to the powerlessness of the Pharisees to help him.  But suddenly he became valuable to them as a means to trap Jesus.  So they began by raising a legal quibble: “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?”<br />
Jesus answered by asking if they would pull one of their sheep out of a pit on the Sabbath. Of course they would! But why? Perhaps their pretext was that it was a work of mercy—but another consideration might be that the sheep was worth money and they would not want to incur financial loss, even on the Sabbath.  Our Lord reminded them that a man is of greater value than a sheep. If it is right to show mercy to an animal, how much more justified is it to do good to a man on the Sabbath!  Having caught the Jewish leaders in the pit of their own greed, Jesus healed the withered hand.</p>
<p><strong>The Unpardonable Sin (12:24–32)<br />
</strong> When Jesus healed a blind and mute demoniac, the common people began to think seriously that He might be the Son of David, the Messiah of Israel. This enraged the Pharisees. Unable to tolerate any suggestion of sympathy with Jesus, they exploded with the charge that the miracle had been performed by the power of Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.  When He read their thoughts, Jesus proceeded to expose their foolishness. He pointed out that no kingdom, city, or house divided against itself can continue successfully. If He was casting out Satan’s demons by the power of Satan, then Satan was working against himself. This would be absurd.  He had a second devastating answer for the Pharisees. Some of their Jewish associates, known as exorcists, claimed to have the power to cast out demons. Jesus neither admitted nor denied their claim, but used it to point out that if He cast out demons by Beelzebub, then the Pharisees’ sons (i.e. these exorcists) did also. The Pharisees would never admit this, but could not escape the logic of the argument. Their own associates would condemn them for implying that they exorcised by the power of Satan.</p>
<p>The truth, of course, was that Jesus cast out demons by the Spirit of God. His entire life as a Man on earth was lived by the power of the Holy Spirit. He was the Spirit-filled Messiah whom Isaiah had foretold (Isa. 11:2; 42:1; 61:1–3). Therefore He said to the Pharisees, “ &#8230; if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.” This announcement must have been a crushing blow. They prided themselves on their theological knowledge, yet the kingdom of God had come upon them because the King was among them and they hadn’t even realized that He was there!</p>
<p>Jesus was Satan’s conqueror.  He illustrates this by the story of the strong man. The strong man is Satan. His house is the sphere in which he holds sway. His goods are his demons. Jesus is the One who binds the strong man, enters his house, and plunders his goods. Actually the binding of Satan takes place in stages. It began during Jesus’ public ministry. It was decisively guaranteed by the death and resurrection of Christ. It will be true to a more marked degree during the King’s thousand-year reign (Rev. 20:2). Finally, it will be eternally true when he is cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10). At the present time the devil does not seem to be bound; he still exercises considerable power. But his doom is determined and his time is short.</p>
<p>Then Jesus said, “He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who does not gather with Me scatters abroad.” Their blasphemous attitude showed that the Pharisees were not with the Lord; therefore, they were against Him. By refusing to harvest with Him, they were scattering the grain. They had accused Jesus of casting out demons by the power of Satan while actually they themselves were the servants of Satan, seeking to frustrate the work of God.</p>
<p>Starting in verse 31, we see a crisis in Christ’s dealings with the leaders of Israel. He accuses them of committing the unpardonable sin by blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, that is, by charging that Jesus performed His miracles by the power of Satan rather than by the power of the Holy Spirit. In effect, this was calling the Holy Spirit Beelzebub, the ruler of demons.   By actively denying the Holy Spirit, the agent that draws men and women to the Savior, a person is “cutting the lifeline” so to speak.  Many people worry that they have committed the unpardonable sin.  The fact that a person is concerned is evidence that he is not guilty of it. Those who committed it were hard and unrelenting in their opposition to Christ. They had no qualms about insulting the Spirit and no hesitancy in plotting the death of the Son. They showed neither remorse nor repentance.</p>
<p><strong>A Tree Is Known by Its Fruit (12:33–37)</strong><br />
Even the Pharisees should have admitted that the Lord had done good by casting out demons. Yet they accused Him of being evil. Here He exposes their inconsistency and says, in effect, “Make up your minds. If a tree is good, its fruit is good and vice versa.” Fruit reflects the quality of the tree that produced it. The fruit of His ministry had been good. He had healed the sick, the blind, the deaf, and the dumb, had cast out demons and raised the dead. Could a corrupt tree have produced such good fruit? Utterly impossible! Why then did they so stubbornly refuse to acknowledge Him?  The reason was that they were a brood of vipers. Their malice against the Son of Man, evidenced by their venomous words, was the outflow of their evil hearts. A heart filled with goodness will be evidenced by words of grace and righteousness. A wicked heart expresses itself in blasphemy, bitterness, and abuse.  Jesus solemnly warned them (and us) that people will give account for every idle word they utter. Because the words people have spoken are an accurate gauge of their lives, they will form a suitable basis for condemnation or acquittal. How great will be the condemnation of the Pharisees for the vile and contemptuous words which they spoke against God’s Holy Son!   “For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” In the case of believers, the penalty for careless speech has been paid through the death of Christ; however, our careless speech, unconfessed and unforgiven, will result in loss of reward at Christ’s Judgment Seat.</p>
<p><strong>The Sign of the Prophet Jonah (12:38–45)</strong><br />
Despite all the miracles Jesus had performed, the scribes and Pharisees had the temerity to ask Him for a sign, implying that they would believe if He would prove Himself to be the Messiah! But their hypocrisy was transparent. If they had not believed as a result of so many wonders, why would they be convinced by one more? The attitude that demands miraculous signs as a condition for belief does not please God. As Jesus said to Thomas, “Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed” (John 20:29).</p>
<p>The Lord addressed them as an evil and adulterous generation; evil because they were willfully blind to their own Messiah, adulterous because they were spiritually unfaithful to their God.  He told them summarily that no sign would be given to them except the sign of the prophet Jonah, referring to His own death, burial, and resurrection. Jonah’s experience of being swallowed by the fish and then disgorged (Jon. 1:17; 2:10) prefigured the Lord’s passion and resurrection. His rising from among the dead would be the final, climactic sign of His ministry to the nation of Israel.  Just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so our Lord predicted that He would be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. This raises a problem. If, as generally believed, Jesus was buried on Friday afternoon and rose again on Sunday morning, how can it be said that He was three days and nights in the tomb? The answer is that, in Jewish reckoning, any part of a day and night counts as a complete period. “A day and a night make an onah, and a part of an onah is as the whole” (Jewish saying).</p>
<p>Jesus depicted the guilt of the Jewish leaders by two contrasts. First, the Gentiles of Nineveh were far less privileged, yet when they heard the preaching of the errant prophet Jonah, they repented with deep grief.  Second, the queen of Sheba, a Gentile outside of Jewish privilege, traveled from the South, at great effort and expense, for an interview with Solomon. The Jews of Jesus’ day did not have to travel at all to see Him; He had traveled from heaven to their little neighborhood to be their Messiah-King. Yet they had no room in their lives for Him—One infinitely greater than Solomon.<br />
 <br />
Now Jesus gives, in parabolic form, a summary of the past, present, and future of unbelieving Israel. The man represents the Jewish nation, the unclean spirit the idolatry which characterized the nation from the time of its servitude in Egypt to the Babylonian captivity (which temporarily cured Israel of its idolatry). It was as if the unclean spirit had gone out of the man. From the end of the captivity to the present day, the Jewish people have not been idol-worshipers. They are like a house that is empty, swept, and put in order.  Over nineteen hundred years ago, the Savior sought admittance to that empty house. He was the rightful Occupant, the Master of the house, but the people steadfastly refused to let Him in. Though they no longer worshiped idols, they would not worship the true God either.  The empty house speaks of spiritual vacuum—a dangerous condition, as the sequel shows. Reformation is not enough. There must be the positive acceptance of the Savior.  In a coming day, the spirit of idolatry will decide to return to the house, accompanied by seven spirits more wicked than himself. Since seven is the number of perfection or completeness, this probably refers to idolatry in its fully developed form. This looks forward to the time when the apostate nation will worship the Antichrist. To bow down to the man of sin and to worship him as God is a more terrible form of idolatry than the nation has ever been guilty of in the past. And so the last state of that man becomes worse than the first.</p>
<p><strong>The Mother and Brothers of Jesus (12:46–50)<br />
</strong>These verses describe a seemingly commonplace incident in which Jesus’ family comes to speak to Him. Why had they come? Mark may give us a clue. Some of Jesus’ friends decided He was out of His mind (Mark 3:21, 31–35), and perhaps His family came to take Him away quietly (see also John 7:5). When told that His mother and brothers were waiting outside to speak with Him, the Lord responded by asking, “Who is My mother and who are My brothers?” Then, pointing to His disciples, He said “Whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother.”   Blood relationships are superseded by spiritual considerations. Obedience to God will bring men and women, whether Jews or Gentiles, into vital relationship with Him.</p>
<p>Before leaving this incident, we should mention two points concerning the mother of Jesus. First, it is evident that Mary did not occupy any place of special privilege as far as access into His presence was concerned.</p>
<p>Second, the mention of Jesus’ brothers strikes a blow at the teaching that Mary was a perpetual virgin. The implication is strong that these were actual sons of Mary and therefore half-brothers of our Lord. This view is strengthened by such other Scriptures as Psalm 69:8; Matt. 13:55; Mark 3:31, 32; 6:3; John 7:3, 5; Acts 1:14; 1 Cor. 9:5; Gal. 1:19.</p>
<h5>LESSON 10 – Matthew 13</h5>
<p>3 Then He spoke many things to them in parables, saying: “Behold, a sower went out to sow. 4 And as he sowed, some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds came and devoured them. 5 Some fell on stony places, where they did not have much earth; and they immediately sprang up because they had no depth of earth. 6 But when the sun was up they were scorched, and because they had no root they withered away. 7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked them. 8 But others fell on good ground and yielded a crop: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 9 He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</p>
<p>10 And the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?”<br />
11 He answered and said to them, “Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. 12 For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. 13 Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. 14 And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says:<br />
‘Hearing you will hear and shall not understand, And seeing you will see and not perceive; 15 For the hearts of this people have grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, And their eyes they have closed, Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So that I should heal them.’  16 But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear; 17 for assuredly, I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.</p>
<p>18 “Therefore hear the parable of the sower: 19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is he who received seed by the wayside. 20 But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; 21 yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles. 22 Now he who received seed among the thorns is he who hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful. 23 But he who received seed on the good ground is he who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and produces: some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.”</p>
<p>24 Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; 25 but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way. 26 But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared. 27 So the servants of the owner came and said to him, ‘Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?’ 28 He said to them, ‘An enemy has done this.’ The servants said to him, ‘Do you want us then to go and gather them up?’ 29 But he said, ‘No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.” ’ ”</p>
<p>31 Another parable He put forth to them, saying: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field, 32 which indeed is the least of all the seeds; but when it is grown it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and nest in its branches.”</p>
<p>33 Another parable He spoke to them: “The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened.”</p>
<p>34 All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables; and without a parable He did not speak to them, 35 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: “I will open My mouth in parables; I will utter things kept secret from the foundation of the world.”</p>
<p>36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house. And His disciples came to Him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.”<br />
37 He answered and said to them: “He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. 38 The field is the world, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one. 39 The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels. 40 Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age. 41 The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness, 42 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. 43 Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!</p>
<p>44 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and hid; and for joy over it he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.</p>
<p>45 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking beautiful pearls, 46 who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.<br />
47 “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some of every kind, 48 which, when it was full, they drew to shore; and they sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but threw the bad away. 49 So it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come forth, separate the wicked from among the just, 50 and cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”</p>
<p>51 Jesus said to them, “Have you understood all these things?” They said to Him, “Yes, Lord.” 52 Then He said to them, “Therefore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.” 53 Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished these parables, that He departed from there.</p>
<p><strong>Parables of the Kingdom<br />
The Parable of the Sower (13:1–9)<br />
</strong>Jesus went out of the house where He had healed the demoniac and sat by the sea of Galilee.  As great multitudes gathered on the beach, He got into a boat and began to teach the people by parables. A parable is a story with an underlying spiritual or moral teaching which is not always apparent immediately. The parables that follow tell us what the kingdom will be like during the time between His First and Second Advents.</p>
<p>The first four were spoken to the multitude; the last three were given only to the disciples. The Lord explained the first two and the seventh to the disciples, leaving them (and us) to interpret the others with the keys He had already given.<br />
The first parable concerns a sower who planted his seed in four different types of soil. As might be expected, the results were different in each case.</p>
<p><strong>SOIL RESULTS<br />

<p>Jesus closed the parable with the cryptic admonition, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!” In the parable He was conveying an important message to the multitude, and a different message to the disciples. None should miss the significance of His words.  The Lord Himself interprets the parable in verses 18–23.</p>
<p>The Purpose of the Parables (13:10–17)<br />
The disciples were puzzled that the Lord should speak to the people in the veiled language of parables. So they asked Him to explain.  In His reply, Jesus distinguished between the unbelieving crowd and the believing disciples. The crowd, a cross-section of the nation, was obviously rejecting Him, though their rejection would not be complete until the cross. They would not be permitted to know the mysteries (secrets) of the kingdom of heaven, whereas His true followers would be helped to understand.  A mystery in the NT is a fact never previously known by man, which man could never learn apart from divine revelation, but which has now been revealed. The mysteries of the kingdom are  unknown truths concerning the kingdom.  The parables describe some of the features of the kingdom during the time when the King would be absent.</p>
<p>It may seem arbitrary that these secrets should be withheld from the multitude and revealed to the disciples. But the Lord gives the reason: “For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away.” The disciples had faith in the Lord Jesus; therefore, they would be given the capacity for more. They had accepted the light; therefore, they would receive more light. The Jewish nation, on the other hand, had rejected the Light of the world; therefore they were not only prevented from receiving more light, they would lose what little light they had. Light rejected is light denied.  Matthew Henry compares the parables to the pillar of cloud and fire which enlightened Israel while confusing the Egyptians. The parables would be revealed to those who were sincerely interested but would prove “only an irritation to those who were hostile to Jesus.”   So it was not a matter of whim on the Lord’s part, but simply the outworking of a principle which is built into all of life—willful blindness is followed by judicial blindness. They were a living fulfillment of the prophecy of Isaiah 6:9, 10. Israel’s heart had grown dull and their ears were insensitive to the voice of God. They deliberately refused to see with their eyes. They knew that if they saw, heard, understood, and repented, God would heal them. But in their sickness and need, they refused His help. Therefore, their punishment was that they would hear but not understand, and see but not perceive.  On The other hand, the disciples were tremendously privileged, because they were seeing what no one had seen before. The prophets and righteous men of the OT had longed to be living when the Messiah arrived, but their desire had not been fulfilled. The disciples were favored to live at that crisis moment in history, to see the Messiah, to witness His miracles, and to hear the teaching which came from His lips.</p>
<p>Explanation of the Parable of the Sower (13:18–23)<br />
Having explained why He used parables, the Lord now proceeds to expound the parable of the four soils. He does not identify the sower but we can be sure that it refers either to Himself (v. 37) or to those who preach the message of the kingdom. He defines the seed as the word of the kingdom (v. 19). The soils represent those who hear the message.</p>
<p>The hard-packed pathway speaks of people who refuse to receive the message. They hear the gospel but do not understand it—not because they can’t but because they won’t. The birds are a picture of Satan; he snatches away the seed from the hearts of these hearers. He cooperates with them in their self-chosen barrenness.</p>
<p>When Jesus spoke of rocky ground, He had in mind a thin layer of earth covering a ledge of rock. This represents people who hear the word and respond with joy. At first the sower might be elated that his preaching is so successful. But soon he learns the deeper lesson, that it is not good when the message is received with smiles and cheers. First there must be conviction of sin, contrition, and repentance. It is far more promising to see an inquirer weeping his way to Calvary than to see him walking down the aisle light-heartedly and exuberantly. The shallow earth yields a shallow profession; there is no depth to the root. But when his profession is tested by the scorching sun of tribulation or persecution, he decides it isn’t worth it and abandons any profession of subjection to Christ.</p>
<p>The thorn-infested ground represents another class who hear the word in a superficial way. They appear outwardly to be genuine subjects of the kingdom but in time their interest is choked out by the cares of this world and by their delight in riches. There is no fruit for God in their lives.</p>
<p>The good ground represents a true believer. He &#8230; hears the word receptively and understands it through obeying what he hears. Although these believers do not all produce the same amount of fruit, they all show by their fruit that they have divine life. Fruit here is probably the manifestation of Christian character rather than souls won to Christ. When the word fruit is used in the NT, it generally refers to the fruit of the Spirit (Gal. 5:22, 23).</p>
<p>The Parable of the Wheat and Tares (13:24–30)<br />
The preceding parable was a vivid illustration of the fact that the kingdom of heaven includes those who give only lip service to the King as well as those who are His genuine disciples. The first three soils typify the kingdom in its widest circle—outward profession. The fourth soil represents the kingdom as a smaller circle—those who have been truly converted.</p>
<p>The second parable—the wheat and the tares—also sets forth the kingdom in these two aspects. The wheat depicts true believers, the tares are mere professors. Jesus compares the kingdom to a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat. Unger says that the most common tare found in grainfields in the Holy Land is bearded darnel, “a poisonous grass, almost indistinguishable from wheat while the two are growing into blade. But when they come into ear, they can be separated without difficulty.”<br />
 <br />
The Parable of the Mustard Seed (13:31, 32)<br />
Next the Savior likens the kingdom to a mustard seed which He called the smallest of seeds, that is, smallest in the experience of His listeners. When a man planted one of these seeds, it grew into a tree, a growth that is phenomenal. The normal mustard plant is more like a bush than a tree. The tree was large enough for birds to nest in its branches<br />
The seed represents the humble beginning of the kingdom. At first the kingdom was kept relatively small and pure as a result of persecution. But with the patronage and protection of the state, it suffered abnormal growth. Then the birds came and roosted in it. The same word for birds is used here as in verse 4; Jesus explained the birds as meaning the evil one (v. 19). The kingdom became a nesting place for Satan and his agents. Today the umbrella of Christendom covers such Christ-denying systems as Unitarianism, Christian Science, Mormonism, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the Unification Church.</p>
<p>So here the Lord forewarned the disciples that during His absence the kingdom would experience a phenomenal growth. They should not be deceived nor equate growth with success. It would be unhealthy growth. Though the tiny seed would become an abnormal tree, its largeness would become “a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every foul spirit, and a cage for every unclean and hated bird” (Rev. 18:2).</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Leaven (13:33)<br />
</strong>Next the Lord Jesus compared the kingdom to leaven which a woman hid in three measures of meal. Eventually all the meal became leavened. A common interpretation is that the meal is the world and the leaven is the gospel which will be preached throughout the world until everyone becomes saved. This view, however, is contradicted by Scripture, by history, and by current events.<br />
Leaven is always a type of evil in the Bible. When God commanded His people to rid their houses of leaven (Ex. 12:15), they understood this. If anyone ate what was leavened from the first till the seventh day of this Feast of Unleavened Bread, he would be cut off from Israel. Jesus warned against the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees (Matt. 16:6, 12) and the leaven of Herod (Mark 8:15). In 1 Corinthians 5:6–8 leaven is defined as malice and evil, and the context of Galatians 5:9 shows that there it means false teaching. In general, leaven means either evil doctrine or evil behavior.  So in this parable the Lord warns against the permeating power of evil working in the kingdom of heaven. The parable of the mustard seed shows evil in the external character of the kingdom; this parable shows the inward corruption that would take place.  I believe that in this parable the meal represents the food of God’s people as it is found in the Bible. The leaven is evil doctrine. The woman is a false prophetess who teaches and beguiles (Rev. 2:20). </p>
<p><strong>The Use of Parables Fulfills Prophecy (13:34, 35)<br />
</strong>Jesus spoke the first four parables to the multitude. The use of this teaching method by the Lord fulfilled Asaph’s prophecy in Psalm 78:2 that the Messiah would speak in parables, uttering things kept secret from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation of the Parable of the Tares (13:36–43)<br />
</strong>The remainder of the Lord’s discourse was spoken to the disciples, inside the house.  In His interpretation of the wheat and tares parable, Jesus identified Himself as the sower. He sowed directly during His earthly ministry, and has been sowing through His servants in succeeding ages.  The field is the world. It is important to emphasize that the field is the world, not the church. The good seeds mean the sons of the kingdom. It might seem bizarre and incongruous to think of living human beings being planted into the ground. But the point is that these sons of the kingdom were sown in the world. During His years of public ministry, Jesus sowed the world with disciples who were loyal subjects of the kingdom. The tares are the sons of the wicked one. Satan has a counterfeit for every divine reality. He sows the world with those who look like, talk like, and, to some extent, walk like disciples. But they are not genuine followers of the King.</p>
<p>The enemy is Satan, the enemy of God and all the people of God. The harvest is the end of the age, which will be when Jesus Christ returns in power and glory to reign as King.  The reapers are the angels (see Rev. 14:14–20). During the present phase of the kingdom, no forcible separation is made of the wheat and the darnel. They are allowed to grow together. But at the Second Advent of Christ, the angels will round up all causes of sin and all evildoers and throw them into the furnace of fire, where they will weep and gnash their teeth.   The righteous subjects of the kingdom who are on earth during the Tribulation will enter the kingdom of their Father to enjoy the Millennial Reign of Christ. There they will shine forth as the sun; that is, they will be resplendent in glory.  Again Jesus adds the cryptic admonition, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</p>
<p>This parable does not justify, as some mistakenly suppose, the toleration of ungodly people in a local Christian church. Remember that the field is the world, not the church. Local churches are explicitly commanded to put out of their fellowship all who are guilty of certain forms of wickedness (1 Cor. 5:9–13). The parable simply teaches that in its present form, the kingdom of heaven will include the real and the imitation, the genuine and the counterfeit, and that this condition will continue until the end of the age. Then God’s messengers will separate the false, who will be taken away in judgment, from the true, who will enjoy the glorious reign of Christ on earth.</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Hidden Treasure (13:44)<br />
</strong>In the parable of the treasure, Jesus compares the kingdom to treasure hidden in a field. A man finds it, covers it up, then gladly sells all he has and buys that field.<br />
 <br />
<strong>The Parable of the Pearl of Great Price (13:45, 46)<br />
</strong>The kingdom is also likened to a merchant seeking beautiful pearls. When he finds a pearl of unusually great value, he sacrifices all he has to buy it.<br />
 <br />
<strong>The Parable of the Dragnet (13:47–50)<br />
</strong>The final parable in the series likens the kingdom to a sieve or dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. The fishermen sorted out the fish, keeping the good in containers and discarding the bad. <br />
 <br />
<strong>The Treasury of Truth (13:51, 52)</strong><br />
When He had finished the parables, the Master Teacher asked His disciples if they understood. They replied, “Yes.”  Because they understood, they were obligated to share with others. Disciples are to be channels, not terminals of blessings. The twelve were now scribes trained for the kingdom of heaven; that is, teachers and interpreters of the truth. They were like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old. In the OT they had a rich deposit of what we might call old truth. In the parabolic teaching of Christ, they had just received what was completely new. From this vast storehouse of knowledge they should now impart the glorious truth to others.</p>

<p><strong>1. Notes on Millennial Sacrifices, (Bottom of page)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Questions regarding the prophecies in the OT (Bottom of page)</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Eight items missing from Ezekiel&#8217;s Temple (Bottom of page)</strong></p>
<h5>Lesson 1: Introduction</h5>
<p>As we begin our study of End Times Prophecies, you need to know where I am coming from in terms of theological viewpoint.  As you probably know, every Biblical commentator has a certain viewpoint that they operate from, which directly affects and influences how they deal with the Scriptures (and associated information).  The fancy way of describing my view would be to say that I am a &#8220;Pre-Millennial Fundamentalist&#8221;.  What that really means is that I believe that there will be a series of events that are foretold in Scripture relating to a time period known as the “end times” or “latter days” which will occur immediately prior to a literal 1,000 year earthly reign of Christ, followed by the Eternal Kingdom.  <span id="more-1272"></span>I take the Bible literally, knowing that there is symbolism and allegory in God&#8217;s Word, but believing that what God specifically says is what He really means.  For example, I believe that there will be a real, literal &#8220;mark of the Beast&#8221; that people will choose to take at some point during the events of the 70th &#8220;week&#8221; of Daniel.  Although many modern commentators choose to teach that such material is only symbolic, I believe that God meant what He said, and that we need to be aware of the fact that a time will come when the people of the earth will have to knowingly choose whether or not to accept the mark of God&#8217;s enemy.</p>
<p>Another aspect of my &#8220;viewpoint&#8221; on Scripture is that I believe that the best way to study and interpret Scripture is in the light of Scripture.  By that I mean that whenever God uses symbols, or difficult to understand phrasing, you will find that He has explained His meaning in some other part of Scripture.  Using Scripture as its&#8217; own commentary by cross-referencing, and by studying the original languages of the Bible (Hebrew and Greek), you will find that the vast majority of what people see as &#8220;confusing&#8221; or &#8220;impossible to understand&#8221; is actually quite clear.  This is not to say that there aren&#8217;t still some &#8220;mysteries&#8221; in God&#8217;s Word, but it is not as unapproachable as most people think.</p>
<p>That being said, let’s look at a few guidelines for the study of prophecy:<br />
The first and most important guideline for studying prophecy is to seek the plain and normal meaning of the words and situations described within their historical context. Don’t come to a prophetic passage with a preconceived conclusion or interpretive system to force it into. Let the grammatical and historical context communicate the plain and normal meaning, and then incorporate that meaning into what you already know.</p>
<p>A second guideline for interpreting prophecy is: compare one prophecy with another, especially similar prophecies. Each prophecy unfolds a bit more of the total plan of God for the ages. Often there are overlapping and corresponding references in a few or several prophecies, though they may have been delivered hundreds of years apart. (Compare the description of “the Ancient of Days” in Daniel 7:9–14 with the “One like the Son of Man” in Revelation 1:13–16 and the Lamb in chapter 5:8–14.)</p>
<p>A third guideline for interpreting prophecy is to remember that the timing of the fulfillment may be uncertain. From God’s side of eternity the elements are complete and the prophecy is already fact. From man’s side, separate future events may seem to blend into one, as a person looking toward a range of mountains may see two peaks as one, not perceiving the valley between them or its size and unique characteristics.  This principle suggests that biblical prophecies may have several layers of fulfillment. Some of the events prophesied in the book of Daniel began to happen in the days of Babylon, Persia, and Greece.  But those prophecies were only partially fulfilled at that time. Classical scholars would see the second-century invasion of Jerusalem by Antiochus Epiphanes (in 167–164 B.C.) as a type or partial fulfillment of yet other future events which are yet to occur at the end of this age (Dan. 9:26, 27; 11:21–35).</p>
<p>The fourth guideline for interpreting prophecy is sometimes called the law of double reference. A prophecy may have a fulfillment both in the time of the prophet, and another in the perhaps distant future. For instance, the prophetic sign given to Ahaz in Isaiah 7:14 also refers both to the birth of a son by Isaiah’s wife (Is. 8:3) and to the birth of the Messiah by the Virgin Mary (Matt. 1:22; Luke 1:27).<br />
 <br />
Now that we’ve covered some of the basics, let’s begin our journey with the first “end times” prophecy in the Bible, which deals with the following question, “Is there a time limit to human history, and if so, where are we on the timeline?”</p>
<p><strong>Genesis 2:1-3  <br />
</strong>1 Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them, were finished. 2 And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Peter 3:8<br />
</strong>8 But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>
<p>The literal translation of the text of 2nd Peter 3:8 is “….. and a thousand years as DAY ONE”  This is important when we remember that the Jews did not have NAMES for days, like we do (we have Monday, Tuesday, etc.).  Their days were as follows:  Day One, Day Two, Day Three, Day Four, Day Five, Day Six, SABBATH.  Many commentators (and I agree with them) state that God established a pattern in the week of Creation that will reflect the pattern of human history.  We will have “six days” (6,000 years) of “regular” history, followed by a “day” (1,000 years) of “sabbath”, under the direct rule of Christ (commonly known as the Millennium).</p>
<p>If this is the case, where do we stand in “the week”?  Well, the current year in the Jewish calendar (which supposedly began counting at the creation of the world) is the year 5,766; which would leave us approximately 234 years left.  We can all breathe a big sigh of relief, right? </p>
<p>Well, NO!  You see, the current Jewish calendar was established by “sages” in the Middle Ages who calculated their times by the reigns of the various kings listed in the Old Testament.  However, more recent archeological finds in the Middle East have caused archeologists and historians at the University of Tel Aviv in Israel to state that the commonly accepted calendar is OFF by approximately 240 years!  If they are correct, then we could hit the big “6,000” VERY soon.</p>
<p>From “The Jewish New Testament Commentary”<br />
“According to Jewish tradition, there were 2,000 years without Torah—spiritual tohu—between the creation of Adam and the time when Abraham, aged 52, began convincing people to worship the one true God.<br />
The second 2,000 years supposedly lasted from then until 172 years after the destruction of the second Temple, that is, until 244 C.E. That was the year 4000 by the Jewish calendar, but no significant event in Jewish history took place then. However, biblical chronology has a number of uncertainties, so that not all agree that the Jewish calendar accurately dates the biblical beginning of creation. James Ussher, Archbishop of Armagh, Ireland, writing in the 17th century, placed the creation according to Genesis at 4004 B.C.E., exactly 4,000 years before Yeshua’s supposed birthdate (see Mt 2:1N).</p>
<p>Concerning the third 2,000 years, a footnote to this passage in the Soncino English edition of the Talmud says, “Messiah will come within that period. He should have come at the beginning of [it]; the delay is due to our sins.” It should be obvious that the Messiah who “should have come at the beginning” of the last 2,000-year period is in fact Yeshua, who did come then. The delay is not of his coming but of our recognizing him, and this delay is indeed “due to our sins.” For more on predicting when the Messiah is to come, see Mt 24:36N.<br />
Yet, as Kefa points out, there is a delay in his second coming; and this is, in a different sense, “due to our sins”: The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise … ; on the contrary, he is patient with you; for it is … his purpose that everyone should turn from his sins, literally, “that everyone should come to repentance” (see Mt 3:2N).”</p>
<p>This theory was also taught by the early church leaders and commentators, such as Origen, Justin Martyr, and others.</p>
<p>From “The Ante-Nicene Fathers, Volume 1”<br />
“THE FALSE AND THE TRUE SABBATH<br />
Further, also, it is written concerning the Sabbath in the Decalogue which [the Lord] spoke, face to face, to Moses on Mount Sinai, “And sanctify ye the Sabbath of the Lord with clean hands and a pure heart.” And He says in another place, “If my sons keep the Sabbath, then will I cause my mercy to rest upon them.” The Sabbath is mentioned at the beginning of the creation [thus]: “And God made in six days the works of His hands, and made an end on the seventh day, and rested on it, and sanctified it.” Attend, my children, to the meaning of this expression, “He finished in six days.” This implieth that the Lord will finish all things in six thousand years, for a day is with Him a thousand years. And He Himself testifieth, saying, “Behold, to-day will be as a thousand years.” Therefore, my children, in six days, that is, in six thousand years, all things will be finished. “And He rested on the seventh day.” This meaneth: when His Son, coming [again], shall destroy the time of the wicked man, and judge the ungodly, and change the sun, and the moon, and the stars, then shall He truly rest on the seventh day.”</p>
<p><strong>From “The Post Nicene Fathers, Volume 7, Lactantius”<br />
</strong>Therefore, since all the works of God were completed in six days, the world must continue in its present state through six ages, that is, six thousand years. For the great day of God is limited by a circle of a thousand years, as the prophet shows, who says “In Thy sight, O Lord, a thousand years are as one day.” And as God labored during those six days in creating such great works, so His religion and truth must labor during these six thousand years, while wickedness prevails and bears rule. And again, since God, having finished His works, rested the seventh day and blessed it, at the end of the six thousandth year all wickedness must be abolished from the earth, and righteousness reign for a thousand years; and there must be tranquillity and rest from the labors which the world now has long endured.”<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<h5>Lesson 2:  “As In The Days Of Noah”</h5>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:37-44<br />
</strong>37 But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 40 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. 42 Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. 44 Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.”</p>
<p><strong>How was it in the days of Noah?<br />
Genesis 6:5-12<br />
</strong>“5 Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. 6 And the LORD was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart. 7 So the LORD said, “I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth, both man and beast, creeping thing and birds of the air, for I am sorry that I have made them.” 8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD. 9 This is the genealogy of Noah. Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God. 10 And Noah begot three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth. 11 The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12 So God looked upon the earth, and indeed it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted their way on the earth.”</p>
<p><strong>2nd Timothy 3:1-5</strong><br />
“1 But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, 4 traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away! “</p>
<p>Our first lesson in this series discussed the fact that The Bible gives a general TIMELINE of the “latter days”; this second lesson discusses the MORAL and SPIRITUAL CLIMATE of these same “latter days”.  Although sin and lawlessness have existed in every generation since The Fall, the end times will be characterized by a higher degree of sinfulness.  In every generation, people have committed ACTS of sin, but the AIM of most societies was to encourage “good behavior”; but the final generation prior to the Millennium will  be characterized by an ACCEPTED lawlessness.  Sin will be both condoned and legitimized by the very entity that is supposed to RESTRAIN behavior; the STATE.  The culture, entertainments, legal and political systems, and home life will change the “expected norms” of “civilized” behavior from the historic standards of community, service, virtue, honor, truthfulness, sanctity of marriage and family, patriotism, and so on.</p>
<p>The specifics of this pattern of behavior are found in the list from 2nd Timothy:<br />
For men will be:<br />
lovers of themselves – looking out for number one, self-centered<br />
lovers of money – greedy, “anything for a buck”<br />
boasters – focusing on self-achievement and self-promotion<br />
proud – individual accomplishment, “I’m the best!”<br />
blasphemers – mocking the things of God<br />
disobedient to parents &#8211; de-emphasizing the family structure and authority<br />
unthankful – lack of gratitude for anything or anyone, “you owe it to me!”<br />
unholy – lacking purity or virtue<br />
unloving – real love is based in self-sacrifice, this will not be seen in relationships<br />
unforgiving – grudges, hard-feelings from childhood on up<br />
slanderers – anything can be said about anyone, whether its’ true or not<br />
without self-control – “I’ve got to have it ALL, NOW”<br />
brutal – vicious, violent, uncaring of the pain of others<br />
despisers of good – any virtue is seen as “weak”<br />
traitors – willing to betray family, friends, co-workers, your country, ANYONE<br />
headstrong – “It’s MY way or the HIGHWAY!”<br />
haughty – looking down on others for any one of a hundred reasons<br />
lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God – “If it feels good, do it!”<br />
having a form of godliness but denying its power – RELIGION, without RELATIONSHIP.  False doctrines, and “anything goes” Christianity.</p>
<h5>Lesson 3:  “The Exodus as a blueprint for the Tribulation”</h5>
<p>The Book of Exodus contains the blueprint for the last generation saints to endure the great tribulation until the Messiah comes. It is the story of the exodus from Egypt to the Promised Land; it is the pattern for the greater exodus from this world to the Messiah’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Moses wrote a song of deliverance (Exodus 15) at the first Exodus. Upon crossing the Red Sea and seeing Pharaoh’s chariots drowned, he sang that song – the song of Moses. I’m sure you have heard the words, &#8220;The horse and rider He has thrown into the sea.&#8221; But, did you know that Moses wrote a second song? The second song is also a song of deliverance and according the book of Revelation, it will be sung along with the song of the Lamb by tribulation saints at the end of the age. The second song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32) is for the greater Exodus. And they sang the song of Moses the bond-servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, &#8220;Great and marvelous are Thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Thy ways, Thou King of the nations. Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? For Thou alone art holy; For all the nations will come and worship before Thee, For Thy righteous acts have been revealed.&#8221; REVELATION 15:3-4</p>
<p>The children of Israel left Egypt with the clear expectation that they were going to the promised land – the land of milk and honey. However, they did not go directly to that land. Instead, they went into the great, terrible wilderness for 40 years and camped at 42 different places. Then, they came to the Jordan river and crossed over to the promised land.  Whereas, Israel camped 42 times, our tribulation is 42 months (3 ½ years). The Hebrew word for Egypt is Mitzrayim. It literally means trials and tribulations.</p>
<p>Lets look at some of the comparisons between the Exodus and the “FINAL” exodus:<br />
 Pharaoh and the Anti-Christ:  Pharaoh hardened his heart against the Lord and great judgment befell Egypt.  The Antichrist will also harden his heart against God and not remember the son of Joseph (Jesus the Messiah). Great judgments will befall the world and the Antichrist so that everyone will &#8220;know the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moses and Aaron – the two witnesses Moses and Aaron went into Pharaoh and spoke the Lord’s will, &#8220;Let My people go.&#8221; With each refusal, Moses and Aaron pronounced God’s judgments upon Egypt and Pharaoh. In like manner, we will have two witnesses prophesying in Jerusalem, pronouncing judgments upon the world, and warning the people, &#8220;Behold, Here is your God!&#8221;</p>
<p>God’s Judgments as Sets The ten plagues that hit Egypt were three sets of three judgments with a final judgment. They can be identified by where Moses was when the judgment is brought forth. Beginning with the first judgment, water into blood, the judgments came forth in this manner: At the river Nile, at the Palace, then unannounced. This pattern repeats itself through the first nine. Therefore, the judgments were actually three sets of three each. It is not that the judgments announced at the river Nile happened first then all the Palace announcements happened, etc. They were integrated with each other. In like manner, we can see that the future Revelation judgments are three sets of seven.</p>
<p>The Locusts and Darkness Judgment Judgment number eight and nine in ancient Egypt were particularly difficult. These preceded the final judgment. God demonstrates His great wisdom and judgment by doing the same with us in the great tribulation. In the final days of the tribulation, an asteroid, meteor, or comets strikes the earth in a deep impact scenario. According to the prophet Joel and John, great clouds billow up to darken the sun, moon, and stars. All the prophets have spoken of the world being in darkness before the coming of the Lord. From the abyss in the earth, demons come forth in this darkness to terrorize men. They are compared to locusts, following in mass and devastating everything in their path.</p>
<p>The 10 Tests in the Wilderness Israel was purposely tested in the wilderness. God wanted to transform the people and teach them to trust Him. And you shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not. And He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord. Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years. Thus you are to know in your heart that the Lord your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son. DEUTERONOMY 8:2-5 Beginning with the crossing of the Red Sea and ending with Israel’s rejection at Kadesh-Barnea, Israel failed 10 tests.</p>
<p>These tests are summarized by two categories (belief and obedience) as the following questions:<br />
 Belief and Trust: 1. Will God save us from Pharaoh (Antichrist)?<br />
                             2. Will God provide water?<br />
                             3. Will God provide food?<br />
                             4. Will God be with us to defend us?<br />
                             5. Is God the One and only, true God?</p>
<p>Obedience and Blessing: 6. Will we reject God’s provision?<br />
                                        7. Will we reject God’s presence?<br />
                                        8. Will we reject God’s salvation?<br />
                                        9. Will we reject God&#8217;s Anointed?<br />
                                       10. Will we reject God’s Kingdom?</p>
<p>At the Red Sea, Pharaoh and his chariots approached to slaughter the children of Israel. The unbelievers cried out that Moses had brought them out to die. But Moses answered and told the people to be quiet and see the salvation of God. God led them through the Red Sea and drowned the Egyptians before their eyes. When the great tribulation comes, the first test will be whether God will save us from the Antichrist and his chariots. Many believers have been told that the Antichrist will be very powerful in the world. The Antichrist will be given power for a specific period; however, our God will not forsake us nor abandon us to the enemy. He is a savior and His arm is not short to deliver those who take refuge in Him. The Apostle Paul makes reference to these tests explaining that they are to teach us. He also says they are intended for the people at the end of the ages (the last generation). Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. 1st CORINTHIANS 10:11</p>
<p>Wanting to return to Egypt It didn’t take long before the children of Israel began to mumble and grumble among themselves. The accommodations were not all that great. Food and water were questionable. Eventually, Moses’ leadership came into question. They complained that in Egypt they had cucumbers, melons, leeks and garlic; in the wilderness, all they had was manna. They also had taken a lot of gold from Egypt. What could they spend their gold on out in the wilderness? All of this led to various groups and individuals rising up in opposition saying that they should return to Egypt. In like manner, I can assure you that these very issues will present themselves in the great tribulation in the camp of believers. They will get hungry for McDonald’s french fries, Chinese take-out, and pizza delivery. What’s more, many believers will bring money with them, but there won’t be anywhere to spend it in the camp. The temptation will come and our own brethren will rise in opposition to camp leadership. The issue won’t be the leaders; the issue will be money, and they will want to go spend it back in the cities.</p>
<p>For the Fear of our Children The greatest concern and most difficult issue for Israel in the wilderness was preparing to enter the land of Israel. When the spies returned and said, &#8220;There are giants in the land,&#8221; the people believed that their enemies would kill their children. For this reason, they would not trust the Lord despite all that the Lord had done and shown them. In like manner, we will face our greatest test in believing that the Lord will protect and care for our children. The children of Israel didn’t believe the Lord; they were judged for their unbelief and disobedience in refusing to enter the land. So God took their children and took the land with them. The parents died one by one in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Crossing the River Jordan When Israel crossed the Jordan river, they entered the promised land as a nation. They had leaders, laws, and land. The Angel of the Lord went before them. They were no longer slaves to Egypt. They were a free people with a covenant from God. In like manner, we will be resurrected from the dead or changed by the rapture. We will have new bodies. We will have Jesus with us.  We will no longer be slaves to sin and the world; we will be free and servants of the Living God. We will receive another covenant – the covenant of peace. And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever. My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people. EZEKIEL 37:26-27</p>
<h5>Lesson 4:  “End Times Prophecies In The Psalms”</h5>
<p><strong>Psalm 2<br />
</strong>1 Why do the nations rage, And the people plot a vain thing? 2 The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the LORD and against His Anointed, saying, 3 “Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us.” 4 He who sits in the heavens shall laugh; The LORD shall hold them in derision. 5 Then He shall speak to them in His wrath, And distress them in His deep displeasure: 6 “Yet I have set My King On My holy hill of Zion.” 7 “I will declare the decree: The LORD has said to Me, ‘You are My Son, Today I have begotten You. 8 Ask of Me, and I will give You The nations for Your inheritance, And the ends of the earth for Your possession. 9 You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a  potter’s vessel.’ ” 10 Now therefore, be wise, O kings; Be instructed, you judges of the earth. 11 Serve the LORD with fear, And rejoice with trembling. 12 Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, And you perish in the way, When His wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him.</p>
<p>This psalm relates to the Second Coming of Christ and the establishment of the Millennial Kingdom.  Notice the attitude of the earth immediately prior to Christ’s coming.  The Father has decreed that The Son will inherit all the nations of the earth, and rule them with severity.  See Revelation 13:1-7, Revelation 19:11-19<br />
<strong>Psalm 96<br />
</strong>1 Oh, sing to the LORD a new song! Sing to the LORD, all the earth. 2 Sing to the LORD, bless His name; Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day. 3 Declare His glory among the nations, His wonders among all peoples. 4 For the LORD is great and greatly to be praised; He is to be feared above all gods. 5 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, But the LORD made the heavens. 6 Honor and majesty are before Him; Strength and beauty are in His sanctuary. 7 Give to the LORD, O families of the peoples, Give to the LORD glory and strength. 8 Give to the LORD the glory due His name; Bring an offering, and come into His courts. 9 Oh, worship the LORD in the beauty of  holiness! Tremble before Him, all the earth. 10 Say among the nations, “The LORD reigns; The world also is firmly established, It shall not be moved; He shall judge the peoples righteously.” 11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; Let the sea roar, and all its fullness; 12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it. Then all the trees of the woods will rejoice before the LORD. 13 For He is coming, for He is coming to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with righteousness, And the peoples with His truth.<br />
Christ will establish the court of His palace, and the peoples of the earth will bring praise into it.  He will judge the earth and all peoples with righteousness and truth.  See Ezekiel 44:1-3,  46:1-3</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 110<br />
</strong>1 The LORD said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.” 2 The LORD shall send the rod of Your strength out of Zion. Rule in the midst of Your enemies! 3 Your people shall be volunteers In the day of Your power; In the beauties of holiness, from the womb of the morning, You have the dew of Your youth. 4 The LORD has sworn And will not relent, “You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek.” 5 The Lord is at Your right hand; He shall execute kings in the day of His wrath. 6 He shall judge among the nations, He shall fill the places with dead bodies, He shall execute the heads of many countries. 7 He shall drink of the brook by the wayside; Therefore He shall lift up the head.</p>
<p><strong>See  Ezekiel 39:8-21</strong></p>
<p>These three psalm relate to the actual conquest of the earth by the Messiah, the warfare against God’s Anointed, and Christ’s victory over the massed armies of the earth.  He then establishes His Millennial Kingdom, and His palace, and directly rules and judges the earth.</p>
<p>After His resurrection, Jesus did not establish the kind of kingdom envisioned in the Old Testament. But history did not come to a close with Jesus’ death and resurrection. Some 2,000 years have passed since the events recorded in the New Testament took place. An appropriate question, then, is, What happened to the covenant promises made to David?  The best answer is not to assume that the covenant promises given to David were symbolic, and have been fulfilled “spiritually” in the blessings Christians now enjoy. The Old Testament prophecies are far too specific for that. The best answer is to link the ultimate fulfillment of the covenant promises to Christ’s return and the end of history.</p>
<p>Jesus promised to return (Matthew 24). This chapter of Matthew is eschatological. It describes events which will take place at history’s end. The Gospels speak of a time of terrible tribulation here on earth. Jesus speaks of His own return to earth in great power. Matthew wrote, “They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other” (Matt. 24:30–31).</p>
<p>Revelation 19 describes Jesus’ return in power to rule. This chapter of the book of Revelation depicts Jesus’ return and His victory over God’s enemies. Jesus is called KING OF KINGS and LORD OF LORDS (Rev. 19:16).  When Christ returns, He will not appear as suffering Savior but as King of kings. He will take the throne not only of Israel but of the whole world.</p>
<p>The early Christians expected the promises to David to be fulfilled at Jesus’ return. Today many Christians have concluded that the ancient covenant promises given to Israel were set aside by Jesus, and that the commitments given to Abraham and his descendants have been fulfilled symbolically in the church.  HOWEVER, this view was not held in the early church. The early Christians expected the covenant promises made to Israel to be fulfilled when Jesus returns. About A.D. 150 Justin Martyr wrote, “I and as many as are orthodox Christians, do acknowledge that there shall be a resurrection of the body, and a residence of a thousand years in Jerusalem, adorned and enlarged, as the prophets Ezekiel, Isaiah, and others do unanimously attest” (2Vol. I, p. 239).  The early church fathers integrated the teaching of Revelation with Old Testament prophecy and with Jesus’ own statements about the future found in Matthew 24 and Mark 13. Before the world came to an end, the church fathers expected Jesus to return and to institute the age of blessing spoken of in the Old Testament.</p>
<p><strong>THE DAVIDIC COVENANT HAD PROPHETIC APPLICATION</strong><br />
As we move into the prophets, we begin to see an additional dimension of the Davidic Covenant. David is always to have a descendant qualified to sit on his throne—until the promise to David is fulfilled in a ruler who will establish an endless kingdom.  In addition, the Old Testament prophets linked the coming ruler, called the Messiah, or Anointed One, with specific promises made to Abraham. David’s descendant will rule over a restored Hebrew kingdom, reestablished on the land promised to Abraham. God will bless His people then by being their God. And the Davidic King will be a banner to which even the Gentiles rally. So all families on earth will be blessed through Him.</p>
<p>The New Testament predicts a return of Jesus before the world ends. And it is as history draws to its close that the promises given Abraham are to be fulfilled by Jesus as God’s agent and as David’s great Son.</p>
<h5>Lesson 5:  “End Time Prophecies In Isaiah &#8211; The Messianic Kingdom”</h5>
<p>Isaiah 2:1-11</p>
<p>Isaiah 4:2-6</p>
<p>Isaiah 11:1 – 12:6</p>
<p>Isaiah 24:1 – 27:13</p>
<p>Isaiah 32:1 – 35:10</p>
<p>Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, looks beyond the current (for him) chaos to the glorious kingdom of the Messiah. In that day Jerusalem will be established as the religious and political capital of the world. The Gentile nations will make pilgrimages to Zion for worship and for divine instruction.  The King will arbitrate international problems and settle disputes for the people. As a result, there will be universal disarmament. The funds formerly spent on munitions will be spent on agricultural equipment. These opening verses resemble Micah 4:1–3, either because they are inspired by the same Holy Spirit or because one prophet could be quoting the other.</p>
<p>The section starting in chapter 4 looks forward to the glorious kingdom of Christ. He is the Branch of verse 2, beautiful and glorious. The ancient Chaldee paraphrase here reads, The Christ, or Messiah, of the Lord.  He is also the first fruit of the land, in whom the restored Israelites boast. Unbelievers will have been destroyed by the Lord Jesus at His Second Advent. Saved Jews, recorded for life in Jerusalem, will be called holy. The cleansing of verse 4 is accomplished by judgment and not by the gospel. Mount Zion will be covered by a canopy of cloud by day and of flaming fire by night, a symbol of God’s care and protection.</p>
<p>Isaiah 11 is one of the greatest passages on the Millennium in either the OT or the NT. In one of the quick transitions, so frequent in the prophets, we are now carried forward to the Second Coming of Christ.  First we see the lineage of the Son of David, a Rod from the stem of Jesse, who was David’s father (1 Sam. 17:12).<br />
Even wild animals will submit to Messiah’s rule, making it possible for a nursing child to play by the cobra’s hole.  One of the most glorious promises in all of Holy Scripture is the second half of v. 9, giving the reason for the ideal conditions during the Millennial Kingdom.</p>
<p>The Messiah will be a banner, attracting the Gentiles to Himself, and the seat of His authority will be glorious. The Lord will regather the remnant of His people from all directions of the compass. Judah and Israel (Ephraim) will live together in peace, and will subdue their enemies—the Philistines, Edomites, Moabites, and Ammonites. The tongue of the Sea of Egypt (the Red Sea) will be dried up, and the River (the Euphrates) will be reduced to seven streams so that the Jews can return to the land. A highway will connect Assyria and Israel so that the return from the north will be made easy.  In the glad millennial day, Israel will sing songs of thanksgiving and of trust. With joy the saved remnant will quench its thirst by drawing water from the wells of salvation. Israel will also sing as God’s missionaries to the nations, inviting them to come to Christ for satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Judgment on All the Earth (Chap. 24)<br />
</strong>The judgments of God seem to start with the land of Israel, but they widen to include the whole earth and even wicked beings in the heavens.  Then the prophet mourns the dread horrors of the Great Tribulation. It will be a time of treachery. Escape will be impossible. The earth will careen like a drunkard, as if struck by a mammoth quake. It falls to rise no more.  The wicked hosts in heavenly places will also be judged. This corresponds to Revelation 19:19, 20; 20:1–3. Kings of the earth who have served as their puppets will share in this judgment at the Second Advent of Christ. The Lord’s surpassing glory will put the sun and moon to shame.</p>
<p><strong>The Book of Songs (Chaps. 25–27)<br />
1. Israel’s Song of Praise for Kingdom Blessings (Chap. 25)<br />
</strong>Here the restored Jewish remnant praises the LORD for its deliverance through the Great Tribulation. Enemy cities have been pulverized, causing Gentiles to acknowledge Jehovah’s power. God has been to His people all that they needed.  On Mount Zion the Lord spreads a feast of the finest spiritual delights. He removes the covering of ignorance, the veil of Satanic blindness that has shrouded all nations. He conquers death abolishes sorrow, and removes the stigma from the Jewish people. The remnant will say “This is our God; we have waited for Him; we will be glad and rejoice in His salvation.”  Israel’s enemies, of whom Moab is perhaps representative, will be shamefully trampled.</p>
<p><strong>2. Judah’s Song to the Rock of Ages (Chap. 26)<br />
</strong>Back in the land, the restored remnant celebrates the life of faith and dependence. The righteous nation (redeemed Israel) experiences the perfect peace that comes from leaning hard on Jehovah. Regarding verse 3 the celebrated American Baptist hymnwriter, Philip P. Bliss, used to say “I love this verse more than any other verse in the Bible, ‘Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on Thee: because he trusteth in Thee.’”</p>
<p>Verses 7–19 seem to rehearse the prayers of the remnant when passing through the Tribulation. The Lord has smoothed the path for them and they have waited earnestly for Him to reveal Himself. Only when God acts in judgment will the wicked learn righteousness. God’s hand has been raised in readiness, but when it descends in fury they will be ashamed, and then there will be peace for Israel. The remnant has been ruled by many Gentile masters, but God is their true and only Lord. The nations that troubled Israel will not rise to trouble God’s people again. This verse does not deny the bodily resurrection of the wicked; it merely promises that the Gentile powers will never be restored.<br />
But after Israel goes through travail similar to that of childbirth, which seemingly has accomplished nothing, the nation will enjoy a resurrection. Jehovah answers His people’s prayer with a definite promise of national restoration when the refreshing dew of herbs (the Holy Spirit) is poured out on the land.  In the meantime, the Lord counsels the faithful remnant of His people to hide in secret chambers while He pours out His wrath on the apostate world.</p>
<p><strong>3. God’s Song over Redeemed Israel (Chap. 27)<br />
</strong>In the coming day of the LORD, Jehovah will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent (seen by some as Assyria), Leviathan that twisted serpent (seen by some as Babylon), and He will slay the reptile that is in the sea (seen by some as Egypt). Some commentators understand all three monsters as symbolizing Babylon. Still others see them as picturing Satan, who energizes world powers; he is called serpent and dragon (Gen. 3:1; Rev. 12:3; 13:2; 16:13).</p>
<p>In that day God will rejoice over His redeemed vineyard of red wine (Israel) with singing. He will guard it night and day. He has no more fury against His people. If any hostile powers were to arise against the remnant, He would burn them like briers and thorns. It would be better for such powers to turn to the Lord for protection and peace. In the Millennium Israel shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with fruit.  God has not dealt with Israel as with her Gentile overlords! No, His chastisement of Israel has been in measure and limited. He drove them off into exile to purge them of the sin of idolatry. This objective will be achieved when Israel utterly destroys every last vestige of images.<br />
In the meantime, Jerusalem is seen in ruins, as shown by calves grazing on the bushes, and women gathering boughs for firewood. All this has come because the people showed no spiritual discernment.  In a coming day, the LORD will thresh the true and the false within the land of Israel. Then He will regather those Jews who are dispersed in such Gentile nations as Assyria and Egypt. Back in the land, they will come to Jerusalem to worship the LORD.</p>
<p><strong>The Reign of the Righteous King (Chap. 32)<br />
</strong>The first five verses describe the Millennial reign of Christ. He is the king who reigns in righteousness; the princes may be the twelve apostles (see Matt. 19:28). “A man will be as a hiding place from the wind &#8230; ” —that Man is the Lord Jesus, providing shelter, protection, refreshment, and shade. No longer will judicial blindness afflict the people, nor will ears be closed to listening obediently. Those who now make rash decisions will have discernment, and those who now stammer will express themselves without hesitation. Moral distinctions will no longer be blurred. The senseless person will not be honored. The coming of Christ will reveal men in their true light. The fool and the knave will be exposed as such (and punished accordingly). The generous man also will be manifested and blessed.</p>
<p>Social justice and righteousness will permeate every aspect of life, resulting in peace, quietness, safety, and confidence. The enemy (forest) shall be leveled by the hail of God’s judgment and the city (its capital) shall be laid low. It will be a happy time, when people can safely sow beside all waters and when the ox and the donkey can range freely without danger.</p>
<p><strong>Woe to the Plunderer/Assyria (Chap. 33)<br />
</strong>33:1–6 The destructiveness and treachery of the Assyrian come back on him (vv. 1, 2). Then God’s people pray to the LORD for deliverance in their time of trouble. When God moves into action, a thunderous noise sends the nations scrambling. It is the Jews’ turn to pounce on the loot of the fleeing enemy and pick it over thoroughly. Christ is enthroned, filling Zion with justice and righteousness, thus making the times stable, and enriching His people with spiritual treasure.</p>
<p>A word goes out to godless Gentiles (you who are afar off) and to apostate Jews in Zion (you who are near). In the fire of God’s judgment, the burning of His wrath, the only ones who will survive are those who walk righteously and separate themselves from every form of evil.  Then secure and satisfied, the believing remnant will see the King in His beauty and the land whose borders are greatly expanded.</p>
<p>In the millennial Zion, the solemn appointed feasts will be held again. The city will be like a tent that is pitched securely and permanently. The LORD will be to Zion everything that a river is to a city—protection, refreshment, and beauty. No enemy galley or majestic ships will ever pass by, because the LORD is there.<br />
In the Kingdom, even the lame will be able to take the prey. Sickness will be over, and the iniquity of the people will be forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>Woe to All Nations (Chap. 34)<br />
</strong>In chapter 34 we have God’s indignation against all nations in general, and against Edom in particular. The latter may be representative of all the other nations. When Jehovah judges the Gentiles (nations) the air will reek from the decomposing corpses, and the mountains will melt away from the torrent of their blood. Even the stellar heavens will be convulsed.  The sword of the LORD, “intoxicated with blood,” will fall in fury on Edom, both on the common people (lambs, goats, rams) and on the nobles or leaders (wild oxen, young bulls, mighty bulls). It is the day of the Lord’s vengeance.</p>
<p>The Glory of the Coming Kingdom (Chap. 35)<br />
After the rebellious nations are destroyed, the glorious kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is introduced. Features of that period include increased fertility of the land and the personal presence of the Lord in glory and excellence. There will be mutual encouragement among the saints. Every type of disability will be removed, and great rejoicing will celebrate the transformation of the desert into well-irrigated fields.</p>
<p>In some editions of the Bible, the supplied summary titles at the tops of the pages of Isaiah read in substance, “Blessings on the church” and “Curses on Israel.” In fact, almost all these predictions are directly aimed at Israel—whether blessings or curses, and the church comes in later or by application. Jennings decries this unjust treatment of Israel by many Christians:<br />
We justly blame those who take all the promises of the Old Testament, and leave only the threatenings for the poor Jew, for in this they do greatly err; yet there is an element of truth in their contention, since “all the promises of God are Yea and Amen in Christ Jesus.” Their error is in saying that since God has no further use for Israel, these comforting forecasts apply, and only apply, to Christians, not to Israel as a nation at all! God be thanked that whatever is of a spiritual character does so apply: the material blessings that Israel shall enter into on the basis of the new covenant of grace are, in a spiritual sense, ours by that same grace. But that does not fulfill these promises that were given directly to Israel as identified with her Messiah, Jesus, and given her long before the Church of God was revealed at all.<br />
<strong> </strong></p>
<h5>Lesson 6:  “End Time Prophecies In Ezekiel”</h5>
<p><strong>PART 1 – Israel’s national rebirth and the great war</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel 37:1-14<br />
</strong>This prophecy began to be fulfilled in 1948, when Israel began to live as a nation again.  However, they are currently a SECULAR nation.  Not until the Second Coming will they be fully restored as a “spiritually alive” people.<br />
Ezekiel 38-39<br />
The first battle of Gog and Magog.  As near as I can figure it, this battle takes place at or near the beginning of the “seventieth week” of Daniel.  Notice which nation is missing from the list of Middle Eastern nations that will attack Israel.<br />
2 “Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 3 and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. 4 I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and lead you out, with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all splendidly clothed, a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords. 5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them, all of them with shield and helmet; 6 Gomer and all its troops; the house of Togarmah from the far north and all its troops—many people are with you.</p>
<p>Gog – a ruler (possibly his name, or title)<br />
Magog – a land that includes Mesheck and Tubal, (which are in Turkey)<br />
Persia – Iran<br />
Ethiopia – North Africa<br />
Libya – west of Israel along the north African coast<br />
Gomer – Southern Ukraine, slightly north of Istambul<br />
Togarmah – Western Armenian region</p>
<p>The phrases “After many days” and “in the latter years” very clearly project the events to the distant future of Israel’s last days before the Second Coming.</p>
<p>What could possibly justify such an all-out military effort by the Muslim confederacy that is described here? The text says “To take a spoil”.  The Arab nations despise Israel and call for her destruction.  Also, although they have tremendous oil wealth, their agricultural and other natural resources are somewhat scarce.  The development of Israel since 1948 has been phenomenal. It is also a known fact that the mineral wealth in the Dead Sea is of almost incalculable value! Much of it is used for production of fertilizer.  Israel also stands at a crossroads of world commerce. Whoever controls Israel could control much more.</p>
<p>The greatest military power in the world will not be able to stand when God lets loose His fury by causing mountains, valleys, and buildings to be leveled. Added to this will be inundating floods, fire and brimstone through volcanic eruptions, and even confusion in the troops taking each other’s lives, perhaps as an escape from the holocaust of the elements. Thus, God will be magnified, because it will be recognized that the Lord has done this.</p>
<p>The destruction of the great army will be almost total. The text states that but one-sixth will survive. However, scholars are not agreed on the meaning of the original construction. The bows and arrows may, without difficulty, be viewed as figurative of weapons of warfare of whatever kind they may be. Even the land of Magog, where many of the troops come from, will experience the wrath of fire from the Lord upon them.</p>
<p>To clean up a carnage of this magnitude, supernatural aid is required. Many, of course, will have had their permanent burial through the leveling of mountains and valleys. The ravenous beasts and birds of prey will clean off the flesh. While Israel is burying the skeletons and bones, seven months will transpire. All the people of the land will be involved in the clean-up. It has been estimated that if an individual buried two bodies a day the total may have been in the millions.<br />
This gruesome task would appear to have a very sobering influence spiritually. No doubt it will prove to be one of the means of leading Israel, as well as the Gentiles, to repentance and faith in the Lord.</p>
<p>Details of God’s purpose in His dealings with Israel are listed in the outline of chapter 39:21-29.   They are: to show His glory among the nations in verse 21; a deliverance from the king of the north in verse 22; the nations observing God’s purpose of chastening Israel in verses 23–24; then the nations observing Israel’s regathering in verses 25–28; and the regeneration of Israel in verse 29. It should be noted that Israel will be saved by God’s mercy, not by their merit; for the Lord will regather Israel for His name’s sake. The regathering of Israel will be one of the great demonstrations of God’s power. As Israel’s deliverance from Egypt was in the past, and the resurrection of Christ from the grave is for the present, so Israel’s regathering and regeneration in the future will eternally magnify the Lord.<br />

<h5>Lesson 7:  “End Time Prophecies In Ezekiel”</h5>
<p><strong>PART 2 –  The Millennial Temple, Worship, and Division of the Land<br />
Ezekiel 40 – 48</strong></p>
<p>The reason that the Millennial Temple is classified as an “end-times” prophecy is because it is a direct response by Jesus Christ to the “Tribulation Temple” of Revelation 11:1-2, Daniel 9:27, Matthew 24:15, where a Rabbinical form of the Mosaic sacrifices will be instituted, and where the Antichrist will declare himself to be god.  This false temple will be a place of un-holiness, while the Millennial Temple will be a place of holiness.</p>
<p>The Millennial Temple in Jerusalem (Chaps. 40–42)<br />
These chapters give the details of the temple which will be erected in Jerusalem. Many of the descriptions are admittedly difficult to understand, but the general outline can be seen. Paul Lee Tan writes:<br />
Non-literal interpreters maintain that this prophecy is a “symbol of the Christian church”. However, this major prophecy in the Book of Ezekiel contains descriptions, specifications, and measurements of the millennial Temple which are so exhaustive that one may actually make a sketch of it, just as one might of Solomon’s historic temple.</p>
<p>The Man with the Measuring Rod (40:1–4)<br />
In the opening verses, Ezekiel is given a vision of the city of Jerusalem and the millennial temple. In the fourteenth year after Jerusalem was captured, Ezekiel was taken up in visions and set on a very high mountain. He was shown a vision of the city of Jerusalem and the millennial temple by a man whose appearance was like &#8230; bronze. The prophet was commanded to fix his mind on everything he saw and to declare it to the house of Israel. This he does in the ensuing chapters.</p>
<p>Chapter 40 deals primarily with the area surrounding the temple; chapter 41 describes the temple itself.  The detailed measurements in chapters 40–43 remind us that in all our service we must build according to God’s specifications (see Ex. 25:40). Precise measurements also would seem to be meaningless unless this is to be a literal building. An allegory or type would scarcely be so architecturally precise. Also, no one has given a satisfactory explanation of the several parts if they are merely symbolic.</p>
<p><strong>The Millennial Worship (Chaps. 43, 44)<br />
</strong>Earlier in the Book of Ezekiel (11:23) we saw the glory cloud reluctantly leaving the temple at Jerusalem. But the glory of the God of Israel will return in the Person of the Lord Jesus when He comes to reign.  He will dwell forever in the midst of His people; no more will they practice spiritual harlotry (idolatry) and related abominations in the shadow of the temple.</p>
<p>The Millennial Administration (Chaps. 45, 46)<br />
45:1-8 &#8211; In the center of the land of Israel, a piece of land will be set apart for the LORD as a holy &#8230; district. It will be twenty-five thousand cubits by ten thousand. It will be divided into two strips. The top half will contain the sanctuary, and will also be for the priests. The lower half will be for the Levites.  At the bottom of the square will be a third strip, a common place, which will include the city of Jerusalem.  All the land to the east and west of this square, as far as the boundaries of the land, will belong to the prince.</p>
<p><strong>MILLENNIAL SACRIFICES<br />
</strong>In Ezekiel 43:20, 26; 45:15, 17 some of the offerings that will be presented during the Millennium are distinctly said to be for the purpose of making atonement. How can this be reconciled with Hebrews 10:12: “But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.” Or Hebrews 10:18: “Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin?”  As used in the OT, the word “atonement” (lit., covering) never means the putting away of sins. Hebrews 10:4 reminds us that “ &#8230; it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.” Rather the sacrifices were an annual reminder of sins (Heb. 10:3). What then did atonement mean? It meant that the sacrifices produced an outward, ceremonial cleanness. They conferred a ritual purification on people, enabling them to draw near as worshipers in fellowship with God. The sacrifices even made atonement for inanimate things, such as the altar (Ex. 29:37), where there could be no thought of remission of sins. All it means is that the altar was cleansed ceremonially and thus made fit for God’s service. When we read of the forgiveness of unintentional sin in connection with atonement (Lev. 4:20), it can only mean the removal of ceremonial defilement so that the person could draw near in worship.</p>
<p>In our day the word “atonement” has acquired a much wider and deeper meaning. It is used, for instance, to describe the entire sacrificial work of Christ by which our sins are put away and we are reconciled to God. But it never has this meaning in the Bible. (In Rom. 5:11 KJV, the word “atonement” should be “reconciliation,” as in NKJV and other versions.)<br />
The sacrifices in Israel’s history looked forward to the perfect and complete sacrifice of Christ. The sacrifices in the Millennium will commemorate His work on Calvary. They will be memorials for Israel just as the Lord’s Supper is for us.<br />
The passages in Hebrews do not rule out any sacrificial ceremony in the future. But they insist that no future sacrifices can ever deal effectively with sins, any more than they did in the past.</p>
<p><strong>The Millennial Land (Chaps. 47, 48)<br />
The Healing of the Waters (47:1–12)<br />
</strong>Ezekiel saw in a vision a river flowing from the door of the temple, past the altar, through the wall south of the east Gate, and down to the Dead Sea. The waters of the sea &#8230; will be healed, and fish will abound in it. Yates writes:<br />
The water of life is a favorite figure in the Old Testament. Desert areas need water that life may be possible. This stream which Ezekiel sees flowing from the Temple makes its way toward the arid regions of the Arabah. In an ever deepening stream it goes on its way to bring life and health and abundant fruit wherever it goes. It is the one remedy that is needed. Jesus took that figure as a basis for his sermon to the woman at the well.</p>
<p>This stream (which will be an actual geographical river) is a striking figure of the blessing, widespread yet incomplete (v. 11), that will flow out during the Millennial Reign of Christ. God will dwell in the temple and therefore a stream of blessing, ever increasing, will go forth to other places. Today God does dwell in our bodies (1 Cor. 6:19) and therefore a stream of blessing should be flowing to others around us (John 7:37, 38).  The river will bring life wherever it flows—a vivid picture of the life-giving ministry of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>The Boundaries of the Land (47:13–23)<br />
</strong>The future borders and divisions of the land are next given. The boundaries are described here.<br />
Within each tribal portion, the land will be divided by lot, according to the tribes of Israel, but strangers will not be excluded from an inheritance.</p>
<p>The Division of the Land (Chap. 48)<br />
48:1–7 It seems that the land will be divided in horizontal strips, from the Mediterranean to the eastern boundary of the land. The northernmost strip will be for the tribe of Dan (v. 1). Then below that, for Asher (v. 2), for Naphtali (v. 3), for Manasseh (v. 4), for Ephraim (v. 5), for Reuben (v. 6), and for Judah (v. 7).  South of Judah will be the portion already assigned to the prince, and including the sanctuary and the city of Jerusalem. This “holy district” will be a large square area bordering on the northern part of the Dead Sea. It will be divided into three horizontal strips, the northernmost one belonging to the priests, and having the Millennial temple in its center. The middle strip will be for the Levites, and the southern strip for the common people, with Jerusalem in its center. The remaining territory east and west of the square will belong to the prince.  Then south of the holy district will be sections for the tribes of Benjamin (v. 23), Simeon (v. 24), Issachar (v. 25), Zebulun (v. 26), and Gad (v. 27).<br />
48:28–35 The city will have twelve gates, three on each side, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Its name will be: Jehovah Shammah—THE LORD IS THERE.</p>
<p>This name reminds us of what was always in the heart of God: He loves His creatures so much that He always planned to have them close to Himself. He is ever searching, asking, “Where are you?”, calling to repentance and faith. As Son of God He even came down to earth to die for us. His wish will be fulfilled: man will be close to His heart. We can engage in and participate in His search for the lost even now, while living close to His heart here on earth. This is God’s desire for us.</p>
<h5>Lesson 8:  “End Time Prophecies In Daniel”</h5>
<p>Daniel 7:1-28<br />
In chapter 7, we have Daniel’s vision of four great beasts coming up from the sea.  These represent the four world empires.</p>
<p>The lion represents Babylon. The eagle’s wings suggest swiftness of conquest.<br />
The bear pictures Medo-Persia. The Persian section was raised up to greater importance than the Median. The three ribs which it held in its mouth perhaps represent the three sections of the Babylonian Empire which were sacked by the Medes and Persians under Cyrus—Babylon in the east; Egypt in the south; and the Lydian kingdom in Asia Minor.  The leopard is a type of Greece. Its four wings of a bird speak of the rapid expansion of the Grecian Empire. Four is the number of the world. Wings speak of speed. Within thirteen years Alexander conquered the world, marching as far east as India. Then he died at thirty-three—empty handed. The leopard’s four heads apparently set forth the division of the empire to four of Alexander’s generals after his death.</p>
<p>The fourth beast, powerful and destructive, was different from the others but had some of their bestial characteristics. It is described as dreadful and terrible, exceedingly strong, with huge iron teeth. It speaks of the Roman Empire, which would follow the Grecian Empire, would cease, and then, after a considerable space of time, would be revived. It is in this revived form that it would have ten horns, that is, ten kings, and a little &#8230; horn, i.e., the future head of the Revived Roman Empire—the Antichrist.</p>
<p>In verse 9, Daniel pictures the fifth and final world empire—the glorious kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ; He will be given universal dominion. The description of the Ancient of Days here resembles that of Christ in Revelation 1.  The Ancient of Days sits as a Judge in court (vv. 10, 26). The little horn and his empire are destroyed (v. 11). The other world empires also cease, but the nations and people continue (v. 12). The Lord Jesus is given universal dominion, a kingdom, the one which shall never be superseded (v. 14).</p>
<p>Daniel made special inquiry concerning the fourth beast which surpassed the others in cruelty and ferocity. He also wanted to know about the ten horns and the other horn before which three fell. He saw the little horn &#8230; making war with the saints of the Tribulation Period until the Ancient of Days came, ended their sufferings, and gave them the kingdom.  The unnamed interpreter explained the fourth beast, the ten horns, and the pompous little horn. The latter will blaspheme the Most High, persecute the saints, and intend to change the “times and seasons” (possibly referring to celebrations, holy days, or other religious observances, as with the proposed U.N. “World Calendar”, which is a strictly lunar based calendar that observes every cultures holy days as one integrated whole). </p>
<p><strong>Daniel 9:20-27<br />
</strong>While he was &#8230; praying, Gabriel, being caused to fly swiftly, reached Daniel about the time of the evening sacrifice. He told him that he was greatly beloved, a tremendous tribute, coming as it did from God Himself. He then gave him an outline of the future history of the Jewish nation under the figure of seventy weeks. Each “week” represents seven years. Since the prophecy is so crucial to understanding God’s program, we will examine it phrase by phrase.</p>
<p>Seventy weeks have been decreed for your people (Israel) and for your holy city (Jerusalem). The historical fulfillment of the first part of the prophecy shows that the weeks are weeks of years. Thus seventy weeks equal 490 years. We will see that the seventy weeks are divided into seven weeks plus sixty-two weeks, and then, after a time gap, one final week.</p>
<p>At the end of these seventy weeks, the following six things will happen:<br />
A) To finish the transgression, to make an end of sins. While this may refer in a general sense to all Israel’s sinful ways, it has special reference to the nation’s rejection of the Messiah. At the Second Advent of Christ, the surviving remnant  will turn to Him in faith and the nation’s transgression and sins will be forgiven.<br />
B) To make reconciliation for iniquity. The basis for reconciliation was laid at Calvary, but this refers to the time, still future, when the believing portion of the nation of Israel will come into the benefit and enjoyment of the finished work of Christ.<br />
C) To bring in everlasting righteousness. This, too, points forward to the Second Advent and the Millennium, when the King will reign in righteousness. It is everlasting righteousness in the sense that it will continue on into the eternal state.<br />
D) To seal up vision and prophecy. The main body of OT prophecy centers on the glorious Return of Christ to earth, and His subsequent kingdom. Therefore, the bulk of prophecies will be fulfilled at the end of the seventy weeks.<br />
E) And to anoint the Most Holy Place. At the beginning of the thousand-year reign, the temple described in Ezekiel 40–44 will be anointed or consecrated in Jerusalem.<br />
F) The glory will return in the Person of the Lord (Ezek. 43:1–5).</p>
<p>“So you are to know and understand that from the issuing of the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem.”  This was the decree of Artaxerxes in 445 B.C. (Neh. 2:1–8).</p>
<p>  Until Messiah the Prince. This refers not merely to the First Advent of Christ, but more particularly to His death (see v. 26a).</p>
<p>There shall be seven weeks (forty-nine years) and sixty-two weeks (434 years). The sixty-nine weeks are divided into two periods, seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.  The city shall be built again, with plaza and moat, even in troublesome times. Jerusalem would be rebuilt (during the first seven weeks) with public square and protective channel, but not without opposition and turmoil.  Then after the sixty-two weeks—that is, after the sixty-two week portion of time, which is really at the end of the sixty-ninth week, The Messiah shall be cut off. Here we have an unmistakable reference to the Savior’s death on the cross. A century ago in his book The Coming Prince, Sir Robert Anderson gave detailed calculations of the sixty-nine weeks, using “prophetic years,” allowing for leap years, errors in the calendar, the change from B.C. to A.D., etc., and figured that the sixty-nine weeks ended on the very day of Jesus’ triumphal entry into Jerusalem, five days before his death.</p>
<p>But not for Himself, or literally and have nothing. This may mean that He had received nothing from the nation of Israel, to which He had come. Or it may mean that He died without apparent posterity (Isa. 53:8). Or it may be a general statement of His utter poverty; He left nothing but the clothes that He wore.</p>
<p>And the people of the prince who is to come. This prince who is to come is the head of the revived Roman Empire, identified by some as the Antichrist. He will come to power during the Tribulation.  The PEOPLE are identified as the Romans.  Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The Romans, under Titus, destroyed Jerusalem and its magnificent gold-trimmed white marble temple in A.D. 70.  The end of it shall be with a flood. The city was leveled as if by a flood. Not one stone of the temple, for instance, was left on another. Titus forbade his soldiers to put Herod’s temple to the torch, but in order to get the gold they disobeyed, thus melting down the gold. To retrieve the melted gold successfully from between the stones they had to pry loose the great stones, thus fulfilling Christ’s words in Matthew 24:1, 2, as well as Daniel’s prophecy.</p>
<p>And till the end of the war desolations are determined. From that time on, the history of the city would be one of war and destruction. The end here means the end of the times of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>We now come to the seventieth week. As mentioned previously, there is a time gap between the sixty-ninth and seventieth weeks. This parenthetical period is the Church Age.  It is never mentioned specifically in the OT; it was a “mystery” hidden in God from the foundation of the world but revealed by the apostles and prophets of the NT period. However, the principle of a gap is nicely illustrated by our Lord in the synagogue at Nazareth (Luke 4:18, 19). Jesus quoted Isaiah 61:1, 2a but cut it short at “the acceptable year of the LORD” (His First Advent), and left off the judgment of His Second Advent: “and the day of vengeance of our God” (Isa. 61:2b). In between was to occur the whole Church Age.</p>
<p>Then he (Antichrist) shall confirm a covenant with many (the unbelieving majority of the nation of Israel) for one week (the seven-year period known as “the seventieth week of Daniel). It may be a friendship treaty, a non-aggression treaty, or a guarantee of military assistance against any nation attacking Israel.  But in the middle of the week he shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering. The Antichrist will turn hostile toward Israel, forbidding further sacrifices and offerings to Jehovah.</p>
<p>And on the wing of abominations. We learn from Matthew 24:15 that he will set up an abominable idolatrous image in the temple and presumably he will command that it be worshiped.  Shall be one who makes desolate. He will persecute and destroy those who refuse to worship the image.</p>
<p>Even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate. Terrible persecution will continue for the last half of the seventieth week, a period known as the Great Tribulation. Then the Roman prince, “the one who makes desolate,” will himself be destroyed, as decreed by God, by being cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:20).</p>
<h5>Lesson 9:  “End Time Prophecies In The Minor Prophets”</h5>
<p>Joel 3<br />
God will gather the Gentile nations to the Valley of Jehoshaphat (the Hebrew word “Jehoshaphat” means “The Lord Judges”) and will judge them there for their treatment of the Jews. Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia will be recompensed for plundering and enslaving God’s people.  The Gentiles are told to “Prepare for war!”, for the Lord will fight with them in the valley of decision. In the Valley of Jehoshaphat the Lord will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. The sovereign God is currently testing all men and nations, as unfashionable as that concept may be to today’s worldly thinkers.  Men dismiss the Biblical teaching concerning judgment to come, for individuals and nations, as a now outmoded concept. But the people of God have held fast through all the generations to the assurance that, in the “day of the Lord,” the Judge of all the earth will do right. That is our confidence, based upon the rock of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>But the LORD will bless His people with deliverance, safety from invaders, and abundant supplies. The land of Israel would become fruitful and well-watered: the mountains shall drip with new wine, the hills shall flow with milk, and all the brooks of Judah shall be flooded with water. Egypt and Edom will become a desolate wilderness, but Judah will be inhabited forever. God will also acquit her of her guilt of bloodshed.</p>
<p>This is fulfilled at the Second Coming.</p>
<p>Zechariah 10:6-9 <br />
These verses predict the re-gathering of both Israel (Joseph) and Judah from worldwide dispersion. Israel (Ephraim) will be like a mighty warrior.<br />
The Lord will whistle for His people and gather them back into the land of Gilead and Lebanon from Egypt and from Assyria where He had sown or scattered them. </p>
<p><strong>This began to be fulfilled in 1948. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Zechariah 12:1-10<br />
</strong>Here the Gentile nations are seen marching against &#8230; Jerusalem in a future day. All who trouble the city will be greatly troubled. They will hurt themselves in trying to lift this very heavy millstone.  In that day God will strike the invaders, both horse and rider, with madness and panic.  The governors of Judah outside of Jerusalem shall say in their heart that the inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength from the LORD.  In that day, &#8230; the governors of Judah will be like a devouring fire, burning everything they touch. Victory will come first to the inhabitants of outlying Judah so that the men of Jerusalem will not be exalted above them. The inhabitants of Jerusalem will be protected and strengthened, and the invading Gentile nations will be destroyed.</p>
<p>The people will mourn bitterly when they look on the Messiah whom they had pierced. “Then they shall look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son”. Notice “on Me.” The One whom they pierced was the Lord Jesus Christ, Jehovah. Mourning for an only son was the deepest form of sorrow for an Israelite.</p>
<p>This is fulfilled during the 1st Battle of Gog and Magog, and at the Second Coming.</p>
<p>Zechariah 13:8-9<br />
Because of their rejection of the Lord Jesus, two-thirds of the nation will die during the Great Tribulation, yet a remnant of one-third will be preserved. This remnant will be refined like silver and gold. They will acknowledge God, and He will acknowledge them as “My people.”</p>
<h5>Lesson 10:  “End Time Prophecies In Matthew 24”</h5>
<p>1 Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. 2 And Jesus said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.” 3 Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?” 4 And Jesus answered and said to them: “Take heed that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many. 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of sorrows. 9 “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. 10 And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. 11 Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. 12 And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But he who endures to the end shall be saved. 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. 15 “Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place” (whoever reads, let him understand), 16 “then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. 18 And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. 19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 20 And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. 21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. 22 And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened. 23 “Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There!’ do not believe it. 24 For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you beforehand. 26 “Therefore if they say to you, ‘Look, He is in the desert!’ do not go out; or ‘Look, He is in the inner rooms!’ do not believe it. 27 For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 28 For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together. 29 “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. 32 “Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. 33 So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors! 34 Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place. 35 Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away.<br />
36 “But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only. 37 But as the days of Noah were, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 38 For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered the ark, 39 and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 40 Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. 42 Watch therefore, for you do not know what hour your Lord is coming. 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not allowed his house to be broken into. 44 Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.<br />
45 “Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season? 46 Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. 47 Assuredly, I say to you that he will make him ruler over all his goods. 48 But if that evil servant says in his heart, ‘My master is delaying his coming,’ 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards, 50 the master of that servant will come on a day when he is not looking for him and at an hour that he is not aware of, 51 and will cut him in two and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus Predicts the Destruction of the Temple (24:1, 2)<br />
</strong>This section is introduced by the significant statement that Jesus went out and departed from the temple This movement is especially significant in view of the words He had just uttered, “ &#8230; your house is left to you desolate” (23:38). It reminds us of Ezekiel’s description of the glory departing from the temple (Ezek. 9:3; 10:4; 11:23).  The disciples wanted the Lord to admire the architectural beauty of the temple with them. Jesus warned that the building would be so completely destroyed that not one stone would be left on top of another. Titus tried unsuccessfully to save the temple, but his soldiers put it to the torch, thus fulfilling Christ’s prophecy. When the fire melted the gold trim, the molten metal ran down between the stones. To get at it, the soldiers had to remove the stones one by one, just as our Lord predicted. This judgment was executed in A.D. 70 when the Romans under Titus sacked Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>The First Half of the Seventieth Week Of Daniel (24:3–14)<br />
</strong>After Jesus had crossed over to the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately and asked Him three questions:<br />
1. When would these things happen; that is, when would the temple be destroyed?<br />
2. What would be the sign of His coming; that is, what supernatural event would precede His return to the earth to set up His kingdom?<br />
3. What would be the sign of the end of the age; that is, what would announce the end of the age immediately prior to His glorious reign? (The second and third questions are essentially the same.)</p>
<p>We must remember that these Jewish disciples’ thinking revolved around the glorious age of the Messiah on earth. Their expectation was His coming in power and glory to destroy His enemies and rule over the world.  Also we should be clear that they were not talking about the end of the world (as in the KJV), but the end of the age (Gk., aiōn).</p>
<p>Their first question is not answered directly. Rather the Savior seems to merge the siege of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 (see Luke 21:20–24) with a similar siege that will occur in the latter days. In the study of prophecy, we often see the Lord moving almost imperceptibly from an early, partial fulfillment to a later, final fulfillment.  The second and third questions are answered in verses 4–44 of chapter 24. These verses describe the seven year period known as Daniel’s Seventieth Week. which will precede Christ’s glorious Coming. The first three and one-half years are described in verses 4–14. The final three and one-half years, known as the Great Tribulation and the Time of Jacob’s Trouble (Jer. 30:7), will be a time of unprecedented suffering for those on earth.</p>
<p>Many of the conditions characterizing the first half of the Tribulation have existed to an extent throughout human history, but will appear in greatly intensified form during the period under discussion.  During the first half of the Seventieth Week, many false messiahs will appear who will succeed in deceiving multitudes. The current rise of many false cults may be a prelude to this, but it is not a fulfillment. These false religious leaders will claim to be the Christ.   There will be wars and rumors of wars. Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. Famines, pestilences, and earthquakes will occur in various parts of the earth. Even today world leaders are alarmed by the specter of famine due to the population explosion. But this will be accentuated by the shortages caused by wars.  Earthquakes are attracting increasing attention.</p>
<p>Verse 8 clearly identifies this period as the beginning of sorrows—the onset of birth-pangs which will bring forth a new order under Israel’s Messiah-King.<br />
Faithful believers will experience great personal testing during the Tribulation. The nations will conduct a bitter hate campaign against all who are true to Him. Not only will they be tried in religious and civil courts (Mark 13:9), but many will be martyred because they refuse to recant.  Many will apostatize rather than suffer and die. Family members will inform against their own relatives and betray them into the hands of bestial persecutors.</p>
<p>Many false prophets will appear and deceive hordes of people. These are not to be confused with the false messiahs of verse 5. False prophets claim to be spokesmen for God. They can be detected in two ways: their prophecies do not always come to pass, and their teachings always lead men away from the true God.</p>
<p>With wickedness rampaging, human affections will be less and less evident. Acts of unlove will be commonplace. “But he who endures to the end shall be saved.” This obviously does not mean that men’s souls will be saved at that time by their enduring; salvation is always presented in the Bible as a gift of God’s grace, received by faith in Christ’s substitutionary death and resurrection. Neither can it mean that all who endure will escape physical harm; we have already learned that many believers will be martyred (v. 9). It is a general statement that those who stand fast, enduring persecution without apostatizing, will be delivered at Christ’s Second Advent. No one should imagine that apostasy will be a means of escape or safety. Only those who have true faith shall be saved. Although saving faith may have lapses, it always has the quality of permanence.</p>
<p>During this period, the gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed worldwide, as a witness to all nations.  The gospel of the kingdom is the good news that Christ is coming to set up His kingdom on earth, and that those who receive Him by faith will enjoy the blessings of His Millennial Reign.</p>
<p>There is a striking parallel between the events listed in verses 3–14 and those of Revelation 6:1–11. The rider on the white horse—false messiah; the rider of the red horse—war; the rider of the black horse—famine; the rider of the pale horse—pestilence or death. The souls under the altar are martyrs. The events described in Revelation 6:12–17 are linked with those in Matthew 24:19–31.</p>
<p><strong>The Great Tribulation (24:15–28)<br />
</strong>At this point we have come to the middle of the Seventieth Week. We know this by comparing verse 15 with Daniel 9:27. Daniel predicted that in the middle of the seventieth week, that is, at the end of three and a half years, an idolatrous image would be set up in the holy place, i.e., the temple in Jerusalem. All men will be ordered to worship this abominable idol. Failure to comply will be punishable by death (Rev. 13:15).  “Therefore when you see the ‘abomination of desolation,’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place” (whoever reads, let him understand). &#8230; The erection of the idol will be the signal to those who know the Word of God that the Great Tribulation has begun. Note that the Lord wants the one who reads the prophecy to understand it.</p>
<p>Those who are in Judea should flee to the mountains; in the vicinity of Jerusalem their refusal to bow to the image would be quickly detected.  Utmost haste will be necessary. If a man is sitting on the housetop, he should leave all his possessions behind. Time spent in gathering belongings might mean the difference between life and death. The man working in the field should not return for his clothes, wherever he may have left them. Pregnant women and nursing mothers will be at a distinct disadvantage—it will be hard for them to make a speedy escape.  Believers should pray that the crisis will not come in winter with its added travel hazards, and that it will not come on the Sabbath, when the distance they could travel would be limited by Mosaic law (Ex. 16:29), which (under the new Temple) would be in force. A Sabbath day’s journey would not be enough to take them out of the danger area.</p>
<p>“For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be.” This description isolates the period from all the inquisitions, pogroms, purges, massacres, and genocides of history. This prophecy could not have been fulfilled by any previous persecutions because it is clearly stated that it will be ended by the Second Advent of Christ.  The tribulation will be so intense that unless those days were shortened, nobody would survive.</p>
<p>Verses 23 and 24 contain renewed warnings against false messiahs and false prophets. In an atmosphere of crisis, reports will circulate that the Messiah is in some secret location. Such reports could be used to trap those who sincerely and lovingly look for Christ. So the Lord warns all disciples not to believe reports of a local, secret Advent. Even those who perform miracles are not necessarily from God; miracles can be satanic in origin. The Man of Sin will be given satanic power to perform miracles (2 Thess. 2:9, 10).  Christ’s Advent will be unmistakable—it will be sudden, public, universal, and glorious. Like the lightning, it will be instantly and clearly visible to all.</p>
<p><strong>The Second Advent (24:29–31)<br />
</strong>At the close of the Great Tribulation there will be terrifying disturbances in the heavens. The sun will be darkened, and since the moon’s light is only a reflection of the sun’s, the moon will also withhold its light. The stars will plunge from heaven and planets will be moved out of their orbits. Needless to say, such vast cosmic upheavals will affect the weather, tides, and seasons on earth.   “Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven.” We are not told what this sign will be. His First Advent was accompanied by a sign in heaven—the star. Perhaps a miracle star will also announce His Second Coming. Some believe the Son of Man is Himself the sign. Whatever is meant, it will be clear to all when it appears. All the tribes of the earth will mourn—no doubt because of their rejection of Him. But primarily the tribes of the land will mourn—the twelve tribes of Israel. “&#8230; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn” (Zech. 12:10).  Then “they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.” What a wonderful moment! The One who was spit upon and crucified will be vindicated as the Lord of life and glory.</p>
<p>The Parable of the Fig Tree (24:32–35)<br />
“Now learn this parable from the fig tree.” Again our Lord draws a spiritual lesson from nature. When the branches of the fig tree become green and tender, you know that summer is near. We have seen that the fig tree pictures the nation of Israel (21:18–22). For hundreds of years Israel has been dormant, with no government of its own, no land, no temple, no priesthood—no sign of national life. The people have been scattered throughout the world.<br />
Then, in 1948, Israel became a nation with its own land, government, currency, stamps, etc. Spiritually, the nation is still barren and cold; there is no fruit for God. But nationally, we might say that its branches are green and tender.<br />
24:33 “So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the very doors!” Israel’s emergence as a nation means not only that the beginning of the Tribulation is near, but that the Lord Himself is near, at the very doors!   After referring to the fig tree, Jesus added, “Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place.” “This generation” could not mean the people living when Christ was on earth; they have all passed away, yet the events of chapter 24 have not taken place. What then did our Lord mean by “this generation”?  The very generation that sees the beginning of these things will see the end.  The same people who see the rise of Israel as a nation will see the Lord Jesus coming in the clouds of heaven to reign.<br />
 <br />
To emphasize the unfailing character of His predictions, Jesus added that heaven and earth would pass away but His words would by no means pass away. In speaking of heaven passing away, He was referring to the stellar and atmospheric heavens—the blue firmament above us—not to that heaven which is the dwelling place of God (2 Cor. 12:2–4). The dissolution of the heaven and the earth is described in 2 Peter 3:10–13 and mentioned again in Revelation 20:11.</p>
<p><strong>The Day and Hour Unknown (24:36–44)<br />
</strong>As to the exact day and hour of His Second Advent, “no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, but My Father only.” This should warn against the temptation to set dates or to believe those who do. We are not surprised that angels do not know; they are finite creatures with limited knowledge.<br />
While those living prior to Christ’s return will not know its day or hour, it seems that those familiar with the prophecy may be able to know the year. They will know, for instance, that it will be approximately three and one-half years after the idol image is set up in the temple (Dan. 9:27; see also Dan. 7:25; 12:7, 11; Rev. 11:2, 3; 12:14; 13:5).   In those days, however, most people will be indifferent, just as in the days of Noah.  The people ate, drank, married, gave in marriage; in other words, they went through the routines of life as if they were going to live forever. Though warned that a flood was coming, they lived as if they were flood-proof. When it came, they were unprepared, outside the only place of safety. That is just the way it will be when Christ returns. Only those who are in Christ, the ark of safety, will be delivered.</p>
<p>In view of the uncertainty as to the day and the hour, men ought to watch. If someone knows his house is going to be broken into, he will be ready, even if he doesn’t know the exact time. The Son of Man will come when least expected by the masses. Therefore, His people should be on the tiptoes of expectancy.</p>
<p><strong>Parable of the Wise and the Evil Servants (24:45–51)<br />
</strong>In the closing section of this chapter, the Lord Jesus shows that a servant manifests his true character by how he behaves in view of his Master’s return. All servants are supposed to feed the household at the proper time. But not all who profess to be Christ’s servants are genuine.   The wise servant is the one who is found caring for God’s people. Such a one will be honored with vast responsibility in the kingdom. The master will make him ruler over all his goods.   The evil servant represents a nominal believer whose behavior is not affected by the prospect of his Master’s soon return. He begins to beat his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunkards. Such behavior demonstrates that he is not ready for the kingdom. When the King comes, He will punish him and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites, where people weep and gnash their teeth.  Many who profess to be Christians show by their hostility toward God’s people and their fraternization with the ungodly that they are not looking for Christ’s Return. For them it will mean judgment and not blessing.</p>
<h5>Lesson 11:  “End Time Prophecies In First Thessalonians ”</h5>
<p>1st Thessalonians 4:13-5:10<br />
13 But I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you sorrow as others who have no hope. 14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.<br />
15 For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who are asleep. 16 For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 17 Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord. 18 Therefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
<p>1 But concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I should write to you. 2 For you yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night. 3 For when they say, “Peace and safety!” then sudden destruction comes upon them, as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. And they shall not escape. 4 But you, brethren, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief. 5 You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness. 6 Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober. 7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk are drunk at night. 8 But let us who are of the day be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet the hope of salvation. 9 For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ, 10 who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with Him. 11 Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.</p>
<p>Old Testament believers had an imperfect and incomplete knowledge of what happened to a person at the time of death. To them “sheol” was an all-purpose word used to describe the disembodied state, both of believers and unbelievers.<br />
They believed that everyone would die eventually, that apparently there would be one general resurrection at the end of the world, and then a final judgment. Martha reflected these sketchy views when she said, “I know that he (Lazarus) will rise again in the resurrection at the last day” (John 11:24).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus brought “life and immortality to light by the gospel” (2 Tim. 1:10). Today we know that the believer departs to be with Christ at the time of death (2 Cor. 5:8; Phil. 1:21, 23). The unbeliever is said to be in Hades (Luke 16:22, 23). We know that not all believers will die, but that all will be changed (1 Cor. 15:51). We know that there will be more than one resurrection. At the Rapture, only believers will be raised (1 Cor. 15:23; 1 Thess. 4:16); the wicked dead will be raised at the end of the thousand-year reign of Christ (Rev. 20:5).<br />
When Paul first went to Thessalonica, he taught the Christians about Christ’s coming to reign and the events that would follow. But in the meantime, problems had arisen regarding those saints who had died. Would their bodies remain in the graves until the last day? Would they be excluded from participation in Christ’s coming and in His glorious kingdom? To answer their questions and to allay their fears, Paul now describes the order of events at the time of Christ’s coming for his people.</p>
<p>The formula, “I do not want you to be ignorant, brethren,”  is used to alert readers to an important announcement. Here the announcement concerns those who have fallen asleep, that is, those believers who have died. Sleep is used to describe the bodies of departed Christians, never their spirits or souls. Sleep is an appropriate simile of death, because in death a person seems to be sleeping. Even our word cemetery comes from a Greek word meaning “sleeping place” (koimētērion). And sleep is a familiar simile, because every night we act out this symbol of death, and every morning is like a resurrection.</p>
<p>The Bible does not teach that the soul sleeps at the time of death. The rich man and Lazarus were both conscious in death (Luke 16:19–31). When the believer dies, he is “present with the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:8). To die is to “be with Christ,” a position which Paul speaks of as “gain” and as being “far better” (Phil. 1:21, 23). This would scarcely be true if the soul were sleeping!   Neither does the Bible teach annihilation. There is no cessation of being in death. The believer enjoys eternal life (Mark 10:30). The unbeliever suffers eternal punishment (Mark 9:48; Rev. 14:11).</p>
<p>With regard to those saints who have died, the apostle says that there is no need for hopeless sorrow. He does not rule out sorrow; Jesus wept at the grave of Lazarus, though He knew He would raise him in a few minutes (John 11:35–44). But he rules out the despairing grief of those who have no hope of heaven, of reunion, of anything but judgment.  The basis of the believer’s hope is the resurrection of Christ. Just as surely as we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so we believe that those who have fallen asleep in Jesus will be raised and will participate in His coming. “For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive” (1 Cor. 15:22). His resurrection is the pledge and proof of ours.   Notice the expression sleep in Jesus or “those who through Jesus sleep.” Knowing that it is merely the Lover of our souls giving sleep to the bodies of His beloved ones robs death of its terror.</p>
<p>Paul goes on to explain that when Christ returns, the living saints will not have any precedence or advantage over sleeping saints.  The exact order of events at Christ’s coming for His saints is now given. The Lord Himself will descend from heaven. He will not send an angel, but will come Himself!<br />
It will be with a shout, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God. Several explanations have been offered as to the significance of these commanding sounds, but frankly it is almost impossible to speak with finality about them:<br />
1. Some feel that the shout is the voice of the Lord Jesus Himself which raises the dead (John 5:25; 11:43, 44) and changes the living.<br />
2. The voice of Michael, the archangel, is commonly understood as an assembling command for the OT saints, since he is so closely associated with Israel (Dan. 12:1; Jude 9; Rev. 12:4–7).  Still others suggest the voice of an archangel summons the angels as a military escort to accompany the Lord and His saints through enemy territory back to heaven (cf. Luke 16:22).</p>
<p>The bodies of the dead in Christ will rise first. Whether this includes the OT saints is debatable. Those who think it does point out that the archangel’s voice is heard at this time, and that he is closely linked with the destinies of Israel (Dan. 12:1).   Then the living shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. The word Rapture, which we use to describe this first phase of the Lord’s return, is derived from the verb used here in the Latin Bible meaning caught up. A “rapture” is a snatching away or a catching up. It is used of Philip in Acts 8:39, of Paul in 2 Corinthians 12:2, 4, and of the male Child in Revelation 12:5.</p>
<p>Think of all that is included in these verses! The earth and the sea yielding up the dust of all the dead in Christ. Then the transforming miracle by which this dust is formed into glorified bodies, free forever from sickness, pain, and death. Then the flight to heaven. And all of this taking place in the twinkling of an eye (1 Cor. 15:52).  Men of the world have difficulty believing the account of the creation of man in Genesis 1 and 2. If they have difficulty with creation, what will they do with the Rapture—when God will recreate millions of people from the dust that has been buried, scattered, strewn, or swept up on the beaches of the world?</p>
<p>“Therefore comfort one another with these words.”  Thoughts of the Lord’s coming do not produce terror for the believer. It is a hope that thrills and cheers and comforts.<br />
<strong>The Day of the Lord (5:1–11)</strong><br />
Once again, we need to remember that the chapter breaks were not in the original text, and that the subject continues from chapter 4 into chapter 5 without interruption. <br />
What does Paul mean by the day of the Lord? It is certainly not a day of twenty-four hours, but a period of time with certain characteristics.   In the OT this term was used to describe any time of judgment, desolation, and darkness (Isa. 2:12; 13:9–16; Joel 2:1, 2). It was a time when God marched forth against the enemies of Israel and punished them decisively (Zeph. 3:8–12; Joel 3:14–16; Obad. 15–17; Zech. 12:8, 9). But it was also any occasion on which God punished His own people for their idolatry and backsliding (Joel 1:15–20; Amos 5:18; Zeph. 1:7–18). Basically it spoke of judgment on sin, of victory for the cause of the Lord (Joel 2:31, 32), and untold blessing for His faithful people.<br />
In the future, the day of the Lord will cover approximately the same period as the times and the seasons. It will include:<br />
1. The Time of Jacob’s trouble (Dan. 9:27; Jer. 30:7; Matt. 24:4–28; 2 Thess 2:2; Rev. 6:1–19:16).<br />
2. The coming of Christ with His saints (Mal. 4:1–3; 2 Thess 1:7–9).<br />
3. The thousand-year reign of Christ on the earth (Joel 3:18 [cf. v. 14]; Zech 14:8, 9 [cf. v. 1]).<br />
4. The final destruction of the heavens and earth by fire (2 Pet. 3:7, 10).</p>
<p>The day of the Lord is the time when God will publicly intervene in human affairs. It is characterized by judgment on the enemies of Israel and on the apostate portion of the nation of Israel, by deliverance of His people, by establishment of Christ’s kingdom of peace and prosperity, and glory for Himself.  The apostle reminds his readers that the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night. It will be completely unexpected to those of the world, taking the unsaved off guard. The world will be wholly unprepared.</p>
<p>This Day will also come suddenly, destructively, inevitably, and inescapably.<br />
There will be an air of confidence and security in the world.  They will believe that MAN has the means to solve the problems of life and peace.  Then God’s judgment will suddenly begin to descend with vast destructive force. Destruction does not mean loss of being, or annihilation; it means loss of well-being, or ruin as far as the purpose of one’s existence is concerned. It will be as inevitable and unavoidable as labor pains upon a pregnant woman. From this judgment there will be no escape.<br />
 <br />
It is important to notice the change in pronouns from “they” and “them” in the previous verses to you and we in the following verses.  The Day of the Lord will be a time of suprise for the unsaved world.  But what will it mean to us? The answer is that we will not be taken unaware, because we are not in darkness.<br />
This Day will come as a thief in the night (v. 2). The only way it will overtake anyone is as a thief, and the only persons it will take by surprise will be those who are in the night, that is, the unconverted.  This verse says that the Day of the Lord will overtake believers, but not as a thief.<br />
The next verses call believers to a life that is consistent with their position. This means watchfulness and sobriety. We are to watch against temptation, laziness, lethargy, and distraction. Positively, we should watch for the Savior’s return.<br />
Sobriety here means not only being sober in terms of alcohol, but also in conversation and in general demeanor.</p>
<p>In the natural realm, sleep is associated with night. So in the spiritual realm, careless indifference characterizes those who are sons of darkness, that is, the unconverted.   Men prefer to carry on their drunken revelry at night; they love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil (John 3:19). The very name “night club” links the ideas of drinking and carousing with the darkness of night.   5:8 Those who are of the day should walk in the light as He is in the light (1 Jn. 1:7). This means judging and forsaking sin, and avoiding excesses of all kinds. It also means putting on the Christian armor and keeping it on. The armor consists of the breastplate of faith and love and the helmet of the hope of salvation. In other words, the armor is faith, love, and hope—the three cardinal elements of Christian character.  The apostle is saying that sons of light should wear the protective covering of a consistent, godly life. What preserves us from the corruption that is in the world through lust?  Faith, or dependence on God. Love for the Lord and for one another. The hope of Christ’s return.</p>

<h5>Lesson 12:  “End Time Prophecies In Second Thessalonians”<br />
2nd Thessalonians 2:1-12<br />
1 Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you, 2 not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come. 3 Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition, 4 who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.<br />
5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? 6 And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time. 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the way. 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming. 9 The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders, 10 and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 11 And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie, 12 that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.</h5>
<p>Paul undertakes to correct a misunderstanding that had arisen in the minds of the saints concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and the Day of the Lord. The saints were suffering such severe persecution that it was easy for them to think that they were already in the first part of the Day of the Lord, i.e., the beginning of the 70th Week of Daniel.  Rumors were floating around that the apostle himself believed and taught that the Day of the Lord had arrived! So he must set the record straight.  Rumors had been circulating that Paul himself had said that the Day of the Lord had arrived. Like most rumors, they were very garbled. One version intimated that Paul had received the information by spirit, that is, by a special revelation. According to another report, the news had come by word, that is, the apostle had publicly taught that the Tribulation had begun. By letter as if from us is generally understood to refer to a forged letter, purportedly from Paul, that the Day of the Lord had started. The expression as if from us probably goes with spirit, word, and letter. None of these sources was to be trusted.</p>
<p><strong>The Man of Sin (2:3–12)<br />
</strong>Now the apostle explains why they could not be in that Day. Certain events must take place first.  Notice that the Apostle does not say that the Rapture has already happened, but that certain events MUST happen that will indicate that the true “end times” has begun.  Although the Church has suffered persecution in ALL ages, some very specific things will occur that will be the indicators of the end of this age.<br />
 <br />
First of all there will be the falling away, or the apostasy. What does this mean? It refers to a wholesale abandonment of Christianity, a positive rejection of the Christian faith. </p>
<p><strong>WARNING!!!  CONTROVERSIAL MATERIAL AHEAD!!!<br />
</strong>What is the &#8220;falling away&#8221; that Paul is talking about?<br />
First, we need to understand that (in the original Greek) there is a definite article attached to the word translated as &#8220;falling away&#8221;, making it &#8220;the falling away&#8221;; a specific and definite event or condition of the latter days.</p>
<p>Second, the word translated as &#8220;falling away&#8221; is &#8220;apostasia&#8221;, which is translated in the KJV as &#8220;to forsake&#8221; and as &#8220;falling away&#8221;, and which literally means &#8220;a falling away, defection, apostasy&#8221;.  One can only fall away from something that is professed.  The increase in occultism, Eastern Religions, the New Age Movement, and so on IS NOT the &#8220;apostasia&#8221;, since they never claimed to be Christian in the first place (although they are &#8220;signs of the times&#8221;).  It is obvious from the text that the &#8220;falling away&#8221; will be from professed Christianity.  People (and churches / denominations) who proclaim themselves to be Christian will defect from true Christian doctrine, and will reject the TRUE Christ for a false &#8220;Christ&#8221; that is in the image that they find comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:10-13<br />
</strong>&#8220;And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another. And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many. And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.&#8221;  <br />
It appears from the articles in the Greek that Christ is speaking of  supposed CHRISTIANS being offended, betraying each other, hating each other, accepting false prophets, and losing their love.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Timothy 4:3-4<br />
</strong>&#8220;For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.&#8221;<br />
Once again, this section refers to Christians, not occultists or pagans.</p>
<p>What is the nature of this &#8220;falling away&#8221;?  It seems to fall into two categories:<br />
A) Lack of sound doctrine due to lusts.<br />
2nd Timothy says that they will not endure sound (or whole, or correct) doctrine, but will follow teachers that tell them &#8220;fables&#8221; that they want to hear.  Under this category could be listed a large number of false doctrines that people base their entire spirituality upon; such as the &#8220;health and wealth gospel&#8221;, the undue emphasis on gifts of the spirit as a means of showing how &#8220;spiritual&#8221; you are, the pro-homosexual movement in many denominations, any of the racist &#8220;Christian Identity&#8221; teachings, Christian Militia teachings, any group that mixes New Age (Eastern) philosophies with Christianity, and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>B) Something having to do with the return of Christ.<br />
Matthew 24:21-27<br />
</strong>&#8220;For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be. And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened. Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not. For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not. For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.&#8221; </p>
<p>Christ Himself says that there will be lies told about His return.  These lies will consist of a SECRET return that is not seen of ALL men.  He says that when He comes for His people, EVERYONE on earth will see Him.  When people are convinced that Christ will return secretly for them, and He doesn&#8217;t, their hopes will be dashed to pieces and their faith will be shaken; especially if they were expecting to avoid the trials and hardships of the tribulation.  Could this relate to the current teachings of the &#8220;pre-trib&#8221; Rapture doctrine?  I firmly believe it does, at least as a part of the overall problem..</p>
<p>What will happen when the two categories come together in the final days?<br />
Churches and Christian families will split; &#8220;fundamentalists&#8221; will be hated and reviled (especially those who insisted that the Church would go through the terrible times of the 70th Week of Daniel); the human nature of the so-called “Christians&#8221; will be at its worst, as they take out their fear, frustration, and disappointment upon those who dared to tell them they were wrong; and persecution and martyrdom will begin from WITHIN the &#8220;Church&#8221;.</p>
<p>When people feel that they have been lied to about Christianity, whether it is in the realm of  &#8220;Jesus will make you wealthy and you&#8217;ll never be sick again&#8221;; &#8220;My Jesus would never make me go through the hard times or make my family go hungry if we don&#8217;t take the mark&#8221;; or any other non-Biblical teaching that people rest their faith and life upon; they will react with anger, hatred, and a desire to &#8220;get even&#8221; with those who make them feel that way.  Satan will use this to bring persecution and martyrdom to those who have held on to the &#8220;pure&#8221; doctrine, and whose hope is not in the various “teachings” of their favorite “preachers”, but in Christ alone.</p>
<p>The Coming Of The Man Of Sin<br />
Then a great world figure will arise. As to his character, he is the man of sin or lawlessness, that is, the very embodiment of sin and rebellion. As to his destiny, he is the son of perdition; he is doomed to eternal judgment.</p>
<p>&#8230; the man of sin and son of perdition (2 Thess. 2:3)<br />
&#8230; the Antichrist (1 Jn. 2:18)<br />
&#8230; the little horn (Dan. 7:8, 24b–26) &#8230; the king of fierce features (Dan. 8:23–25)<br />
&#8230; the prince who is to come (Dan. 9:26)<br />
&#8230; the willful king (Dan. 11:36)<br />
&#8230; the worthless shepherd (Zech. 11:17)<br />
&#8230; the one who comes in his own name (John 5:43)</p>
<p>The man of sin has been given an intriguing variety of identifications down through the years. He has been equated with the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope, the Roman Empire, the final form of apostate Christendom, Judas reincarnated, Nero reincarnated, the Jewish State, Mohammed, Luther, Napoleon, Mussolini, and the embodiment of Satan.   My favorite is the mathematical proof that demonstrates that “Barney The Purple Dinosaur” is the Antichrist!</p>
<p>He will violently oppose every form of divine worship and will enthrone himself in the temple of God in Jerusalem. This description clearly identifies him as Antichrist, the one who is opposed to Christ and who sets himself up in the place of Christ.  Note that this means that a temple of some sort will be rebuilt in Jerusalem.  Daniel 9:27 and Matthew 24:15 show that this blasphemous action of the Antichrist takes place in the middle of the 70th Week. Those who refuse to worship him will be persecuted and many will be martyred.  Paul used to tell the Thessalonians these things when he was still with them. However, with contradictory teaching being given to them which seemed to accurately describe the fierce persecutions they were then enduring, they had forgotten what the apostle had said. We all forget too easily and need to be constantly reminded of the great truths of the faith.</p>
<p>They knew what was restraining the full and open manifestation of the man of sin, and what would continue to restrain him until the appointed time.<br />
This brings us to the third great unanswered question in this chapter. The first is, “What is the apostasy?” The second is, “Who is the man of sin?” The third is, “What or who is the restrainer?”</p>
<p>In the first part of verse 6, the restrainer is described in an impersonal way &#8230; “what is restraining.”  But then in verse 7 it is a person— “He who now restrains.”   I believe that the restrainer is the archangel Michael, protector of Israel.</p>
<p>Who is Michael?  An archangel, or an angel of high rank, who served as prince or guardian over the destinies of the nation of Israel (Dan. 10:21; 12:1). According to the Epistle of Jude, Michael disputed with Satan over the body of Moses (Jude 9).  The Book of Revelation speaks of “Michael and his angels” (Rev. 12:7), who struggled with Satan when the devil rebelled against God at the beginning of time.  Michael’s name means “Who Is Like God?” While Gabriel is more of an announcing and preaching angel, Michael is more involved in protecting and fighting.  Only three times in the Scripture do we see this particular Michael mentioned (there are other Michaels in the Old Testament, but they’re men, not angels).</p>
<p>Michael is a royal champion of God’s people Israel. He’s referred to three times in Daniel, and his tagline gets progressively more exalted and more personal toward Israel:<br />
First he’s called “one of the chief princes” in 10:13.<br />
Then it’s “Michael, your prince” in 10:21.<br />
Finally it’s “Michael, the great prince who protects your people” in 12:1.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, Michael is mentioned twice. In Revelation 12:7 he’s the leading warrior in the great heavenly battle against Satan — “And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back.”</p>
<p>Considering that men worship the antichrist with a corruption of Michaels name in Hebrew (Revelation 13:4), I think that he is the restrainer mentioned by Paul.</p>
<p><strong>END OF CONTROVERSIAL MATERIAL (FOR NOW)</strong></p>
<p>Even when Paul wrote, the mystery of lawlessness was already at work. By this we understand that a tremendous spirit of disobedience to God was already stirring beneath the surface. It was at work in mystery form—not that it was mysterious but rather that it was not yet fully manifested. It was still in germ form.</p>
<p>The Antichrist will unscrupulously use every form of wickedness to deceive  people.  God actually will allow a working of error “that they should believe the lie.”  The lie, of course, is the Antichrist’s claim to be God.  People refused to receive the Lord Jesus as God manifest in the flesh. When He was on earth, He warned men, “I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me: if another comes in his own name, him you will receive” (John 5:43). So now they receive the man of sin who comes in his own name and demands worship as God. “<br />
 <br />
The Antichrist will probably claim some connection to being Jewish (Ezek. 28:9, 10; Dan. 11:37, 38).  Most Jews would not be deceived by one posing as the Messiah unless he claimed to be descended from the tribe of Judah and the family of David.</p>
<p>We know that many people will be saved during the 70th Week.  One hundred and forty-four thousand Jews, for instance, will be saved and will be God’s messengers in preaching the gospel of the kingdom throughout the world. Through their ministry many others will be saved.  These new believers will, as those who already believe and are alive at that time, be “tried by fire”.  We all need to make sure that our faith is real, and will stand the test (in whatever form it may come for us as individuals).<br />

<h5>Lesson 13:  “End Time Prophecies In Second Timothy”<br />
2nd Timothy 3:1 – 4:4<br />
1 But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: 2 For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, 4 traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away! 6 For of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts, 7 always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 8 Now as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, disapproved concerning the faith; 9 but they will progress no further, for their folly will be manifest to all, as theirs also was.<br />
10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me. 12 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution. 13 But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. 14 But you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, 15 and that from childhood you have known the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br />
16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.<br />
1 I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom: 2 Preach the word! Be ready in season and out of season. Convince, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching. 3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; 4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.</h5>
<p><strong>The Coming Apostasy (3:1–13)<br />
</strong>The apostle Paul gives Timothy a description of conditions that will exist in the world prior to the Lord’s coming. It has often been pointed out that the list of sins that follows is very similar to the description of the ungodly heathen in Romans 1.  The remarkable thing is that the very conditions that exist among the heathen in their savagery and uncivilized state will characterize professing believers in the last days.<br />
One cannot study these verses without being struck by the repetition of the word lovers. In verse 2, for instance, we find lovers of self and lovers of money. In verse 3, the expression “despisers of good” means literally “no-lovers-of good.” In verse 4, we read of “lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.”</p>
<p>In verses 2–5, nineteen characteristics of mankind during the last days are given. We shall simply list them and give synonyms that explain their meaning:<br />
Lovers of themselves—self-centered, conceited, egotistical.<br />
Lovers of money—greedy for money, avaricious.<br />
Boasters—braggarts, full of great swelling words.<br />
Proud—arrogant, haughty, overbearing.<br />
Blasphemers—profane, abusive, foulmouthed, contemptuous, insulting.<br />
Disobedient to parents—rebellious, undutiful, uncontrolled.<br />
Unthankful—ungrateful, lacking in appreciation.<br />
Unholy—impious, profane, irreverent, holding nothing sacred.<br />
Unloving—hard-hearted, unnaturally callous, unfeeling.<br />
Unforgiving—refusing to make peace, refusing efforts toward reconciliation.<br />
Slanderers—spreading false and malicious reports.<br />
Without self-control—men of uncontrolled passions, dissolute.<br />
Brutal—savage, unprincipled.<br />
Despisers of good—haters of good; opposed to goodness in any form.<br />
Traitors—treacherous, betrayers.<br />
Headstrong—reckless, self-willed, rash.<br />
Haughty—making empty pretensions, conceited.<br />
Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God—those who love sensual pleasures but not God.</p>
<p>Outwardly these people seem religious. They make a profession of Christianity, but their actions speak louder than their words. By their ungodly behavior, they show that they are living a lie. There is no evidence of the power of God in their lives.  There never was regeneration.  They want to be religious and to have their sins at the same time (cf. Rev. 3:14–22). A commentator named Hiebert warns: “It is the fearful portrayal of an apostate Christendom, a new paganism masquerading under the name of Christianity.”</p>
<p>Among the corrupt men of the last days, Paul now singles out a particular group, namely, leaders and teachers of false cults. This detailed description of their character and methods finds its fulfillment in many obvious examples in our present day.  First of all, we read that they creep or worm their way into households. It is not by accident that this description reminds us of the movement of a serpent. If they revealed their true identity, they would not succeed in getting into many of these homes, but they use various subtle devices, such as speaking about God, the Bible, and Jesus (even if they do not believe what Scripture teaches about these).</p>
<p>Next it says that they make captives of gullible women. This is characteristic. They plan their visit when the husband is apt to be at work or elsewhere. History repeats itself. Satan approached Eve in the Garden of Eden and deceived her. She usurped authority over her husband, making the decision that should have been left to him. Satan’s methods have not changed. He still approaches the womenfolk with his false teachings and leads them captive. These women are gullible in the sense that they are weak and unstable. They do not lack brains as much as they lack strength of character.  They are described as loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts. This suggests, first of all, that they are burdened under a sense of sin and feel a need in their lives. It is at this crucial time that the cultists arrive. How sad it is that those who know the truth of God’s word are not more zealous in reaching these anxious souls. Secondly, we read that they are led away by various lusts.  The thought seems to be that, conscious of their load of sin and seeking relief from it, they are willing to expose themselves to every passing wind of doctrine and to every religious novelty.</p>
<p>The expression always learning does not mean that they are continually learning more about the Lord Jesus and the word of God. Rather, it means that they are constantly delving into one cult after another, but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. The Lord Jesus is Himself the Truth. These women seem to come ever so close to Him at times, but they are taken captive by the enemy of their souls and never attain the rest that is found only in the Savior.<br />
It should be noted at this point that members of the various cults invariably say, “I am learning,” mentioning the system by name. They can never speak with finality as to an accomplished redemption through faith in Jesus Christ.<br />
This verse also makes us think of the vast present-day increase in knowledge in every realm of human endeavor, the tremendous emphasis on education so prevalent in modern life, and yet the abysmal failure of it all to bring men to the knowledge of the truth.<br />
 <br />
In the eighth verse, Paul returns to the leaders and teachers of false cults. He compares them to Jannes and Jambres who resisted Moses. Who were these men? Actually, their names are not mentioned in the OT, but it is generally understood that they were two of the chief Egyptian magicians who were called in by Pharaoh to imitate the miracles performed by Moses.  The question arises as to how Paul knew their names. This should present no difficulty, for if they were not passed down by Jewish tradition, it is not at all unreasonable that the names could have been given to him by divine revelation.<br />
The important thing is that they resisted Moses by imitating his works, by counterfeit miracles. That is precisely the case with the false cultists. They withstand the work of God by imitating it. They have their own Bible, their own way of salvation—in short, they have a substitute for everything in Christianity. They withstand the truth of God by presenting a cheap perversion, and sometimes by resorting to magical arts.  These men are of corrupt mind. Their minds are distorted, debased, and depraved.</p>
<p>When tested concerning the Christian faith, they are found to be disapproved. The greatest single test that can be applied to them is to ask the simple question, “Is Jesus Christ God?” Many of them seek to hide their false doctrine by admitting that Jesus is the Son of God, but they mean that He is a son of God in the same sense that others are children of God. But when faced with the question, “Is Jesus Christ God?” they show their true colors. They not only deny the deity of Jesus Christ but usually become angry when so challenged. This is true of Christian Scientists, Spiritualists, Christadelphians, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and “The Way.”  Paul assures Timothy that these false teachers will progress no further. The difficulty here is that in every age they seem to be prospering on every hand, and nothing seems to hinder their advance in the world!  The probable meaning is that every system of error is eventually exposed. False systems come and go, one after the other. Although they might seem to prosper mightily, and even for a long time, yet the time comes when their falsity becomes evident to all. They can lead men up to a certain point, even offering a certain measure of reformation. But they fail in that they have no regeneration. They cannot offer a man freedom from the penalty and power of sin. They cannot give life.  Jannes and Jambres could imitate Moses to a certain extent by their acts of magic. However, when it came to producing life from death, they were utterly powerless. This is the very issue on which the false cults meet their defeat.</p>
<p>In marked contrast to these false teachers was the life and ministry of Paul. Timothy was well aware of the nine prominent features which characterized this servant of the Lord. He had followed Paul closely and could testify to the fact that here was a man who was faithful to Christ and His word.<br />
The apostle’s doctrine or teaching was true to the word of God and loyal to the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. His manner of life, or conduct, was consistent with the message he preached. His purpose in life was to be separate from moral and doctrinal evil. Faith here may mean Paul’s trust in the Lord, or his own personal fidelity. Timothy knew him as one who was utterly dependent on the Lord, and at the same time, one who was honest and trustworthy. The apostle’s longsuffering was seen in his attitude toward his persecutors and critics, and toward physical afflictions. As to love, he was selflessly devoted to the Lord and to his fellow men. The less he was loved by others, the more determined he was to love. Perseverance literally means “bearing up under,” that is, fortitude or endurance.<br />
 <br />
Persecution is an integral part of a devout Christian life. It is well that every young Timothy should be reminded of this. Otherwise, when he is called upon to go through deep waters, he might be tempted to think that he has failed the Lord or that the Lord is displeased with him for some reason. The fact is that persecution is inevitable for all who desire to live in a godly manner.  The reason for this persecution is simple. A godly life exposes the wickedness of others. People do not like to be thus exposed. Instead of repenting of their ungodliness and turning to Christ, they seek to destroy the one who has shown them up for what they really are. It is totally irrational behavior, of course, but that is characteristic of fallen man.  Paul had no illusions that the world would gradually become better and better, until finally all men would be converted. Rather, he knew by divine revelation that the very opposite would be the case. Evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse. They would become more subtle in their methods and more bold in their attacks. Not only would they deceive others, but they themselves would be ensnared by the very false teaching with which they sought to trap their hearers. After having peddled their lies for so long, they would actually come to believe them personally.</p>
<p><strong>The Man of God’s Resource in View of the Apostasy (3:14–4:4)<br />
</strong>Time and time again, Timothy is reminded to continue steadfastly in the teachings of the word of God. This would be his great resource in a day when false doctrines would abound on every hand. If he knew and obeyed the Scriptures, he would not be led away by these subtle errors.  Timothy had not only learned the great truths of the faith, but he had become personally assured of them as well. Doubtless he would be told that such teachings were old-fashioned and not sufficiently cultural or intellectual. But he should not abandon truth for theories or human speculations.<br />
 <br />
The Holy Scriptures are spoken of as being continually able to make men wise for salvation. This means, first of all, that men learn the way of salvation through the Bible. It might also carry the thought that assurance of salvation comes through the word of God.  Salvation is through faith which is in Christ Jesus. We should mark this well. It is not through good works, baptism, church membership, obeying the Ten Commandments, keeping the Golden Rule, or in any other way that involves human effort or merit. Salvation is through faith in the Son of God.</p>
<p>When Paul speaks of all Scripture, he is definitely referring to the complete OT. Today we are justified in applying the verse to the entire Bible. 2nd Timothy 3:16-17 is one of the most important verses in the Bible on the subject of inspiration. It teaches that the Scriptures are God-breathed. In a miraculous way, He communicated His word to men and led them to write it down for permanent preservation. What they wrote was the very word of God, inspired and infallible. While it is true that the individual literary style of the writer was not destroyed, it is also true that the very words he used were words given to him by the Holy Spirit. Thus we read in 1 Corinthians 2:13: “These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.” If this verse says anything at all, it says that the inspired writers used WORDS which the Holy Spirit taught. This is what is meant by verbal inspiration.   The writers of the Bible did not give their own private interpretation of things, but wrote the message which was given to them by God. “Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit” (2 Pet. 1:20, 21).  It is false to say that God simply gave the thoughts to the individual writers and allowed them to express these thoughts in their own words. The truth insisted on in the Scriptures is that the very words originally given by God to men were God-breathed.</p>
<p>Because the Bible is the word of God, it is profitable. Every portion of it is profitable. Although man might wonder about some of the genealogies or obscure passages, yet the Spirit-taught mind will realize that there is spiritual nourishment in every word that has proceeded from the mouth of God.<br />
The Bible is profitable for doctrine, or teaching. It sets forth the mind of God with regard to such themes as the Trinity, angels, man, sin, salvation, sanctification, the church, and future events.</p>
<p>Again, it is profitable for reproof. As we read the Bible, it speaks to us pointedly concerning those things in our lives which are displeasing to God. Also, it is profitable for refuting error and for answering the tempter.</p>
<p>Again, the word is profitable for correction. It not only points out what is wrong but sets forth the way in which it can be made right. For instance, the Scriptures not only say, “Let him who stole steal no longer,” but add, “Rather let him labor, working with his hands what is good, that he may have something to give to him who has need.” The first part of the verse might be considered as reproof, whereas the second part is correction.</p>
<p>Finally, the Bible is profitable for instruction in righteousness. The grace of God teaches us to live godly lives, but the word of God traces out in detail the things which go to make up a godly life.</p>
<p>Through the word, the man of God may be complete or mature. He is thoroughly equipped with all that he needs to bring forth every good work which makes up the goal of his salvation (Eph. 2:8–10).<br />
 <br />
Beginning in 4:1, Paul now begins his final solemn charge to Timothy. He does so in the sight of God and the Lord Jesus Christ. All service should be carried out with the realization that it is watched by God’s all-seeing eye. </p>
<p>In view of God’s present observation of His servants and of His future reward, Timothy should boldly proclaim the Word. He should do so with a sense of urgency, availing himself of every opportunity. The message is in season at all times, even when some might think it to be out of season. As a servant of Christ, Timothy will be called upon to convince, that is, to prove or refute. He will have to rebuke what is false. He will be required to exhort or encourage sinners to believe and saints to go on for the Lord. In all of this, he must be unfailing in patient longsuffering and in the faithful teaching of sound doctrine.</p>
<p>In verses 3–4, the apostle gives a strong reason for the charge he has just given.  It is that there will be a general turning away from wholesome doctrine. <br />
The apostle foresees a time when people will show a positive distaste for health-giving teaching. They will willfully turn away from those who teach the truth of God’s word. Their ears will itch for doctrines that are pleasing and comfortable. To satisfy their lust for novel and gratifying doctrine, they will accumulate a group of teachers who will tell them what they want to hear.  The lust for inoffensive preaching will cause people to turn their ears away from the truth to myths. It is a poor exchange—to sacrifice truth for fables—but this is the wretched reward of those who refuse sound doctrine.</p>
<h5>Lesson 14:  “End Time Prophecies In 2nd Peter”</h5>
<p>2nd Peter 2:1 – 3:9<br />
1 But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction. 2 And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. 3 By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction does not slumber.<br />
4 For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved for judgment; 5 and did not spare the ancient world, but saved Noah, one of eight people, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood on the world of the ungodly; 6 and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes, condemned them to destruction, making them an example to those who afterward would live ungodly; 7 and delivered righteous Lot, who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked 8 (for that righteous man, dwelling among them, tormented his righteous soul from day to day by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds)— 9 then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment, 10 and especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. They are presumptuous, self-willed. They are not afraid to speak evil of dignitaries, 11 whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.<br />
12 But these, like natural brute beasts made to be caught and destroyed, speak evil of the things they do not understand, and will utterly perish in their own corruption, 13 and will receive the wages of unrighteousness, as those who count it pleasure to carouse in the daytime. They are spots and blemishes, carousing in their own deceptions while they feast with you, 14 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices, and are accursed children. 15 They have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; 16 but he was rebuked for his iniquity: a dumb donkey speaking with a man’s voice restrained the madness of the prophet.<br />
17 These are wells without water, clouds carried by a tempest, for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.<br />
18 For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, the ones who have actually escaped from those who live in error. 19 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom a person is overcome, by him also he is brought into bondage. 20 For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the latter end is worse for them than the beginning. 21 For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. 22 But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: “A dog returns to his own vomit,” and, “a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.”</p>
<p>1 Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), 2 that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Savior, 3 knowing this first: that scoffers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts, 4 and saying, “Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.” 5 For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water, 6 by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water. 7 But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.  8 But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 9 The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.<br />

<strong>THE RISE OF FALSE TEACHERS PREDICTED (Chap. 2)<br />
</strong>At the close of chapter 1 Peter referred to the prophets of the OT as men who spoke, not by their own will, but as moved by the Holy Spirit. Now he mentions that in addition to the true prophets in the OT period, there were also false prophets. And just as there will be bona fide teachers in the Christian era, there will be false teachers as well.  These false teachers take their place inside the church. They pose as ministers of the gospel. This is what makes the peril so great. If they came right out and said they were atheists or agnostics, people would be on guard. But they are masters of deception. They carry the Bible and use orthodox expressions —though using them to mean something entirely different.  While professing to be ministers of righteousness, they secretly bring in soul-destroying heresies alongside true Bible doctrine. It is a deliberately deceptive mixture of the false and the true. Primarily, they peddle a system of denials.  They deny the verbal, plenary inspiration of the Bible, the Trinity, the deity of Christ, His virgin birth, and His death as a Substitute for sinners. They are especially vehement in their denial of the value of His shed blood. They deny His bodily resurrection, eternal punishment, salvation by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the reality of miracles in the Bible.</p>
<p> <br />
Peter predicts that they will attract a large following. They do this by scuttling the biblical standards of morality and encouraging the indulgence of the flesh.  As a result of this type of behavior, taught and practiced by false teachers, the way of truth is maligned. Unbelievers develop a deep contempt for Christianity.</p>
<p>These false teachers are greedy, both in the sexual and financial realms. They have chosen the ministry as a lucrative profession. Their great aim is to build up a large following and thus to increase their income.  They exploit people with false words. Darby said, “The devil is never more satanic than when he carries a Bible.” So these men, with Bible in hand, pose as ministers of righteousness, give out well-known evangelical hymns, and use scriptural expressions. But all this is camouflage for heretical teachings and corrupt morals.</p>
<p>In verses 4–10, we have three OT examples of God’s judgment on apostasy—the angels, the antediluvians, and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.<br />
We assume that the angels who sinned are those also mentioned in Jude 6. There we learn that: (1) They did not keep their position. (2) They left their proper dwelling. Though we cannot be certain, there is strong reason to believe that these are the same as “the sons of God” mentioned in Genesis 6:2: “The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.” Angels are called sons of God in Job 1:6; 2:1. The inference in Genesis 6 is that these sons of God left the angelic position assigned to them, exchanged their dwelling in heaven for one on earth, and intermarried with human wives. The children born to them were nephilim, which means “fallen ones” (Gen. 6:4). It seems clear from Genesis 6:3 that God was extremely displeased with these abnormal sexual unions.<br />
God was outraged by this gross apostasy of the angels from His established order. Their doom was to be thrown down to hell, committed to pits of utter gloom until the final judgment.</p>
<p>The second illustration of God’s direct intervention in punishing sin relates to the people who perished in the flood. Their wickedness had been great. Every imagination of the thoughts of their heart was only evil continually (Gen. 6:5). In God’s sight the earth was corrupt and filled with violence (Gen. 6:11–13). The Lord was sorry that He had made men on the earth (Gen. 6:6). He was so grieved that He determined to blot them out (Gen. 6:7). He did not spare the ancient world, but brought the flood upon it to destroy its ungodly inhabitants.<br />
Only Noah and his family found favor in the eyes of the Lord. They sought and found refuge in the ark, and rode safely above the storm of God’s wrath and indignation.</p>
<p>The third example of God’s unsparing judgment concerns the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. These two cities, somewhere near what is now the southern area of the Dead Sea, were cesspools of sexual perversion. The people accepted homosexuality as a normal way of life. This sin is described in Romans 1:26, 27:  “Even their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature. Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the penalty of their error which was due.”<br />
God did not look upon this unrestrained degeneracy as sickness but as sin.  He rained fire and brimstone on Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24), reducing them to ashes. The destruction was so complete that there is considerable doubt today as to the exact location of the cities. They serve as an example to any who would legalize this sin or condone it as a disease.</p>
<p>The same God who visits destruction on the ungodly rescues the righteous. Peter illustrates this by the experience of Lot. If we had only the OT account of Lot, we might not think him a true believer at all. In the Genesis account, he almost appears as a status-seeking opportunist, willing to put up with sin and corruption in order to make a place and name for himself in the world. But Peter, writing by inspiration, tells us that he was a righteous man who was oppressed by the filthy conduct of the wicked. God saw that Lot had genuine faith, and that he loved righteousness and hated sin.  To emphasize that Lot really was a righteous man in spite of appearances to the contrary, Peter repeats that his soul was tormented daily by the things he heard and saw in Sodom. The vile immorality of the people caused him deep suffering.  The conclusion is that the Lord knows how to deliver the godly and to punish the ungodly. He can rescue His people from trial, and at the same time reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment.</p>
<p>These apostate religious leaders resemble irrational animals. Instead of using the powers of reasoning which distinguish them from animals, they live as if the gratification of their bodily appetites is the very essence of existence. Just as many animals seem to have no higher destiny than to be killed and butchered, so the false teachers lunge forward to destruction, heedless of what is their true calling—to glorify God and to enjoy Him forever.  They speak evil of the things they do not understand. Their ignorance is never more glaring than when they criticize the Bible. Because they are devoid of divine life, they are utterly unable to understand the words, ways, and works of God (1 Cor. 2:14). Yet they pose as experts in the spiritual realm. A humble believer can see more on his knees than they can see on their tiptoes.  They will be destroyed in the same destruction as the animals. Since they choose to live like animals, they will die like them. Their death will not mean extinction, but they will die ingloriously and without hope.</p>
<p>“Their eyes are full of adultery and cannot cease from sin.”  This describes men who preach supposedly religious sermons, administer the ordinances, counsel the members of their congregation; yet their eyes are constantly looking for women with whom they might have an adulterous affair. Their thirst for lechery, disguised perhaps under the ministerial “cloth,” seems to be limitless.<br />
They entice unstable souls. Perhaps they misuse passages of Scripture to condone sin. Or they explain that matters of right and wrong are largely determined by our culture. Or they suavely reassure their dupes that nothing is wrong if it is done in love. It is easy for unsteady souls to reason that if a thing is all right for a religious leader, it certainly must be all right for a member of the laity.<br />
 <br />
In several ways, these false teachers resemble the prophet Balaam the son of Beor. They falsely pose as spokesmen for God (Num. 22:38). They induce others to sin (Rev. 2:14). But the chief likeness is that they use the ministry as a means of financial enrichment. Balaam was a Midianite prophet hired by the king of Moab to curse Israel. His motive for doing this was money.  On one of his attempts to curse Israel, Balaam and his donkey met the angel of the Lord (that is, the Lord Jesus in one of His pre-incarnate appearances). The donkey repeatedly refused to go on. When Balaam whipped it, the donkey rebuked him in human language (Num. 22:15–34). This was an astonishing phenomenon—a dumb donkey speaking with a human voice (and showing better sense than its master!). But the miracle did not shock Balaam out of his madness.</p>
<p>Peter likens the false teachers to waterless springs. Needy people go to them for refreshment and for relief from spiritual thirst but are disappointed. They are wells without water. They are also clouds carried by a tempest. The clouds hold promise of rain for land that has suffered from prolonged drought. But then a windstorm comes and drives the clouds away. Hopes are dashed; parched tongues are unsatisfied.  They speak great swelling words of emptiness, or as Knox translates it, they use “fine phrases that have no meaning.” This is an accurate description of the words of many liberal preachers and false cultists. They are accomplished orators, holding audiences spellbound by their grandiose rhetoric. Their erudite vocabulary attracts undiscerning people. What their sermons lack in content, they make up for in a dogmatic, forceful presentation. But when they have finished they have said nothing.</p>
<p>The strategy of these false teachers is to allure people by promising unrestrained indulgence in every form of lust and passion. They teach that since our bodily appetites are God-given, they should not be restrained. To do so, they say, would cause severe personality disturbances. And so they advocate sexual experimentation before marriage and relaxed morals after marriage.</p>
<p>Verses 20–22 refer, not to the false teachers themselves, but to their victims. They are people who had reformed but who had not been born again. Through a partial knowledge of &#8230; Christ and of Christian principles, they had turned from a life of sin and begun a moral house-cleaning.<br />
Then they come under the influence of false teachers who mock puritanical virtue and crusade for liberation from moral inhibitions. They become involved again in the very sins from which they had been temporarily delivered. As a matter of fact, they sink lower than before, because now that religious restraints are gone, there is nothing to hold them back. So it is true that their latter state is worse than the first.  The greater a person’s privilege, the greater his responsibility. The more a person knows of Christian standards, the more obligated he is to live up to them. It would be better never to have known God’s holy requirements, than having known them to turn back to the filth of the world.</p>
<p><strong>THE RISE OF SCOFFERS PREDICTED (Chap. 3)<br />
</strong>From the subject of false teachers in chapter 2, Peter turns to the certain rise of scoffers in the last days. In this Letter as in the previous one, he first encourages his readers to cling to the Bible.  They should remember the predictions of the holy prophets—found in the OT; and they should remember the teaching of the Lord as conveyed through the apostles—this is preserved in the NT. The Bible is the only true safeguard in days of declension.</p>
<p>The united testimony of the prophets and apostles was that scoffers would come in the last days, following their own lusts. Christians should remember this. They should not be bowled over by the arrogant and blasphemous denials of these men. Rather they should see in them a definite indication that the end of the age is nearing.  These mockers follow their own passions. Having rejected the knowledge of God, they fearlessly indulge their appetites. They advocate permissiveness with total disregard of any impending judgment.</p>
<p>Their primary attack has to do with the coming of Christ. Their attitude is, “Where is the promise of His coming?” meaning, “Where is the fulfillment of the promise?”   What they really say is this: “You Christians have been threatening us with warnings about a terrible judgment upon the world. You tell us that God is going to intervene in history, punish the wicked, and destroy the earth. It’s all a pack of nonsense. We have nothing to fear. We can live as we please. There is no evidence that God ever has intervened in history; why should we believe that He ever will?”   Their conclusion is based on the careless hypothesis that “since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.” They say that nature invariably follows uniform laws, that there are no supernatural interventions, that there is a natural explanation for everything.</p>
<p>They believe in the law of uniformitarianism. This law states that existing processes in nature have always acted in the same manner and with essentially the same intensity as at present, and that these processes are sufficient to account for all the changes that have taken place.  There is a vital link between the law of uniformitarianism and the usual theories of evolution. The theory of the progressive development of living organisms from pre-existing types depends on the supposition that conditions have been fairly uniform. If this earth has been racked by cataclysms and catastrophes, then some of the presuppositions of Darwinian evolution are affected.</p>
<p>The scoffers deliberately ignore one fact—the flood. God did intervene at one time in the affairs of men, and the specific purpose of His intervention was to punish wickedness. If it happened once, it can happen again.  It is a withering indictment of these men that they are willfully ignorant. They pride themselves on being knowledgeable. They profess to be objective in their reasoning. They boast that they adhere to the principles of scientific investigation. But the fact is that they deliberately ignore a well-attested fact of history—the deluge. They should take a course in geology!  “For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water, &#8230; perished.”   The critics willfully disregard this fact of history. It is interesting that the flood has emerged in recent years as the object of bitter attack. But the record of it is written in stone, in the traditions of ancient peoples and modern, and best of all, in God’s Holy word.</p>
<p>When God created the earth, He seeded it with sufficient water to destroy it. In the same manner, He seeded the heavens and the earth with enough fire to destroy them.  In this nuclear age, we understand that matter is stored-up energy. The splitting of an atomic nucleus results in the fiery release of enormous quantities of energy. So all the matter in the world represents tremendous explosive potential. At present it is held together by the Lord (Col. 1:17, “in Him all things consist”). If His restraining hand were removed, the elements would melt. In the meantime the heavens and the earth are being reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p>
<p>Why then the long delay in God’s judgment?  God has promised to end the history of ungodly men with judgment. If there seems to be delay, it is not because God is unfaithful to His promise. It is because He is patient.  He purposely extends the time of grace so that men might have every opportunity to be saved.   He waited 120 years before He sent the flood. Now He has waited several thousand years before destroying the world with fire.</p>
<h5>Lesson 15:  “End Time Prophecies In Jude”</h5>
<p>1 Jude, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, To those who are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ: 2 Mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.  3 Beloved, while I was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation, I found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. 4 For certain men have crept in unnoticed, who long ago were marked out for this condemnation, ungodly men, who turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. 5 But I want to remind you, though you once knew this, that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe. 6 And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day; 7 as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them in a similar manner to these, having given themselves over to sexual immorality and gone after strange flesh, are set forth as an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.8 Likewise also these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and speak evil of dignitaries. 9 Yet Michael the archangel, in contending with the devil, when he disputed about the body of Moses, dared not bring against him a reviling accusation, but said, “The Lord rebuke you!” 10 But these speak evil of whatever they do not know; and whatever they know naturally, like brute beasts, in these things they corrupt themselves. 11 Woe to them! For they have gone in the way of Cain, have run greedily in the error of Balaam for profit, and perished in the rebellion of Korah.12 These are spots in your love feasts, while they feast with you without fear, serving only themselves. They are clouds without water, carried about by the winds; late autumn trees without fruit, twice dead, pulled up by the roots; 13 raging waves of the sea, foaming up their own shame; wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever.14 Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, 15 to execute judgment on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him.” 16 These are grumblers, complainers, walking according to their own lusts; and they mouth great swelling words, flattering people to gain advantage. 17 But you, beloved, remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ: 18 how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts. 19 These are sensual persons, who cause divisions, not having the Spirit.20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit, 21 keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.  22 And on some have compassion, making a distinction; 23 but others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.</p>
<p>24 Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling, And to present you faultless<br />
Before the presence of His glory with exceeding joy, 25 To God our Savior, Who alone is wise, Be glory and majesty, Dominion and power, Both now and forever.<br />
Amen.<br />
The next-to-the-last book of the New Testament deals once again with the subject of both the current AND the end times APOSTASY.  Noting how much time is spent by all of the N.T. writers on this subject of end times apostasy and false teachers, we should pay careful attention to this subject; especially since we earnestly believe that we are currently living in the “lead-in” period of the end times.</p>
<p>An apostate is a person who professes to be a true believer but who, as a matter of fact, has never been regenerated. He may be baptized and participate fully in the privileges of a local Christian fellowship. But after a while, he willfully abandons the Christian faith and maliciously renounces the Savior. He denies the deity of Christ, His redemptive work at Calvary, His bodily resurrection, or other fundamental doctrines.   It is not at all a question of backsliding; the apostate was never converted at all. He has no qualms about his deliberate spurning of God’s only way of salvation. He is hardened in his unbelief and stubbornly opposed to the Christ of God.</p>
<p>Apostasy is not simply a question of denying the Savior. Peter did that. Peter was a true believer who buckled under the pressures of a crisis. But he really loved the Lord and demonstrated the reality of his faith by his subsequent repentance and restoration.  Judas Iscariot was an apostate. He professed to be a disciple; he traveled with the Lord Jesus for about three years. He even served as treasurer of the team, but finally he revealed his true self by betraying the Lord for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p>Apostasy is a sin leading to death, one that lies beyond the responsibility of believers’ prayers (1 Jn. 5:16b). It is impossible to renew an apostate to repentance, since he crucifies to himself the Son of God, and puts Him to open shame (Heb. 6:6). For those who thus sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, “there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries” (Heb. 10:26, 27).</p>
<p>Jude charges the recipients of his letter to “earnestly contend for the faith”.  It is not enough for a Christian to know the truth for himself; we have a responsibility to make sure that our churches, pastors, and teachers are holding to “the faith once delivered”.</p>
<p>As we come to the end of this lesson series, let’s note some of the important items that we have seen repeated by the authors of Scripture:</p>
<p>1) God WILL deal with the sinfulness and evil of mankind; it will not go unpunished.<br />
2) We have been given specific prophecies of what the “end times” will look like, so that we will not be taken unawares.<br />
3) The Bible spends a lot more time dealing with the issues of false teachers and false doctrines in the “latter days” that it spends on the economic, political, or social features of that time.<br />
4) We are REPEATEDLY warned to be aware, on guard, observant, and careful so that we will not be fooled.<br />
5) We are also repeatedly told that the best way to deal with the upheavals and dangers of the “latter days” is to rest in Jesus, live a holy life, learn and apply the Scriptures in all things,  and stand for the truth of God’s Word.<br />
6) And, lastly, never forget that God is always in charge, and that after everything is said and done, HE WINS, and so do we.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Notes On Millennial Sacrifices</h5>
<p>“Some commentators hold that a reinstitution of sacrifices contradicts Hebrews<br />
8:8-13. Yes, we see sacrifices in the Millennial kingdom because the Bible<br />
prophecies this. We do realize there is no need for sacrifice for sin, however there are other sacrifices, and these sacrifices in the Millennium may be similar to the Lord’s Table in meaning. They may have commemorative value.<br />
The problem is that the objectors probably misinterpret Hebrews, and ignore that the prophecies always mention that the Millennial sacrifices are a<br />
memorial or some other form, rather than the sin sacrifices that are no<br />
longer needed.”<br />
From “Derrickson’s Notes On Theology”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“<strong>MILLENNIAL SACRIFICES&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In Ezekiel 43:20, 26; 45:15, 17 some of the offerings that will be presented during the Millennium are distinctly said to be for the purpose of making atonement. How can this be reconciled with Hebrews 10:12: “But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.” Or Hebrews 10:18: “Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin?”</p>
<p>As used in the OT, the word “atonement” (lit., covering) never means the putting away of sins. Hebrews 10:4 reminds us that “ &#8230; it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.” Rather the sacrifices were an annual reminder of sins (Heb. 10:3). What then did atonement mean? It meant that the sacrifices produced an outward, ceremonial cleanness. They conferred a ritual purification on people, enabling them to draw near as worshipers in fellowship with God. The sacrifices even made atonement for inanimate things, such as the altar (Ex. 29:37), where there could be no thought of remission of sins. All it means is that the altar was cleansed ceremonially and thus made fit for God’s service.</p>
<p>When we read of the forgiveness of unintentional sin in connection with atonement (Lev. 4:20), it can only mean the removal of ceremonial defilement so that the person could draw near in worship.  In our day the word “atonement” has acquired a much wider and deeper meaning. It is used, for instance, to describe the entire sacrificial work of Christ by which our sins are put away and we are reconciled to God. But it never has this meaning in the Bible. (In Rom. 5:11 KJV, the word “atonement” should be “reconciliation,” as in NKJV and other versions.)  The sacrifices in Israel’s history looked forward to the perfect and complete sacrifice of Christ. The sacrifices in the Millennium will commemorate His work on Calvary. They will be memorials for Israel just as the Lord’s Supper is for us.<br />
The passages in Hebrews do not rule out any sacrificial ceremony in the future. But they insist that no future sacrifices can ever deal effectively with sins, any more than they did in the past. “</p>
<p><strong>From “The Believer’s Bible Commentary”</strong></p>
<p>“One feature of the millennial kingdom will be a rebuilt temple, complete with animal sacrifices. Since the Scriptures indicate that much typological significance of both the temple and its service has already been fulfilled by Christ, we might question the need for a temple or for animal sacrifice in the next dispensation. But the temple will (1) demonstrate God’s holiness; (2) provide a dwelling place for the glory of God; (3) perpetuate a memorial of sacrifice; (4) become a center for divine government; and (5) assure victory over the curse. Illustration: The sacrifices in the Millennium will be memorial, much as the observance of the Lord’s Supper is memorial today. When both practices were instituted, they were pointing typologically to the atoning death of Christ. At no time did the sacrifices or the Lord’s Supper have atoning value, though the atonement message is central to their symbolism. When practiced after the Cross, both can have only a memorial significance. Application: As the believer confesses his sin (1 John 1:9) God will forgive and cleanse. (First Reference, Ezek. 47:1–12; Primary Reference, Ezek. 47:1–12; cf. Rev. 20:12.)</p>
<p>The mention of the burnt offering here and in connection with the altar (43:13–27) has proved problematic. Under the new covenant, Jesus Christ “after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God” (Heb. 10:12). How then may one explain this seeming reversion to the Levitical system of bloody sacrifices? Some have suggested that Ezekiel is merely presenting the worship of the Millennium in terms familiar to himself and his readers. Others have pointed out that several good reasons for the use of animal sacrifices can be given. Even the Levitical sacrifices did not take away sin, but were only pictures of Christ’s work prior to its accomplishment. There is no reason that the millennial sacrifices cannot have the status of memorials to the work of Christ, just as the Old Testament sacrifices had their status as precursors of Christ’s work. In the early New Testament church Christian Jews sometimes observed the temple worship (Acts 2:46; 3:1; 5:42) even to the point of offering sacrifices (Acts 21:26). Certainly they knew that these sacrifices added nothing to the work of Christ, but only pictured it. “<br />
From “The KJV Study Bible”</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Questions regarding the prophecies in the OT</h5>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>What do we see as recurring themes in the prophecies?<br />
</strong> 1.God upholds His covenants<br />
 2.God judges sin, even among His Own People<br />
 </p>
<p>In light of 1st Peter 4:12-19, and in light of what we have learned from the Old Testament prophecies, how should we conduct ourselves as the Church?</p>
<p>12 Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; 13 but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. 14 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people’s matters. 16 Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.<br />
17 For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? 18 Now “If the righteous one is scarcely saved, Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?” 19 Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.</p>
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Eight Items Missing From Ezekiel’s Temple</h5>
<p><strong>The Wall Of Partition</strong> – separating Gentiles from the inner areas of the Temple.</p>
<p><strong>The Court Of The Women</strong> – keeping women from the closest areas of the Court of Israel.</p>
<p>These two are done away with according to Galatians 3:27-28</p>
<p><strong>The Laver</strong> – for the washing of priests for ceremonial cleansing.<br />
See Titus 3:5</p>
<p><strong>The Golden Menorah</strong> – to provide light in the Holy Place.<br />
See John 8:12</p>
<p><strong>The Table Of Showbread</strong> – unleavened loaves representing the tribes of Israel, and the Manna God provided in the wilderness.<br />
See John 6:35</p>
<p><strong>The Altar Of  Incense</strong> – to provide the sweet smelling savor to arise before the Lord, representing the prayers of the people as they seek for the Lord.<br />
See Ezekiel 48:35</p>
<p><strong>The Veil That Separates</strong> -  to keep the Holy of Holies closed from the people.<br />
See Isaiah 25:7 and Mark 15:37-38</p>
<p><strong>The Ark Of The Covenant</strong> – the residing place of the tablets of the Law, and the Mercy Seat, described as the footstool of God’s Throne.  See Jeremiah 3:16-17 and Ezekiel 43:5-7</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">INTRODUCTION:</span></strong></p>
<p>As we see the literal fulfillment of Biblical prophecy concerning the “end times” come to pass, we need to be aware that the day is coming (and I believe coming rapidly) that Christians will need to know what to do when we can no longer live in a “business as usual” manner.  The following material includes the subjects of  spiritual and emotional preparation, and several topics of physical preparation.  Of course, all of this information must be evaluated in light of a LOT of prayer.  <span id="more-1212"></span>You must determine what the Lord is leading YOU to do for YOUR family, and in YOUR specific situation.  Also, you must remember that we are not to fear what is coming, because HE is in control of all things, and at all times.  Lastly, we need to remember that our SURVIVAL is NOT the point.  Being obedient to God, and continuing to have a faithful witness of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, even in uncomfortable or unpleasant times, is what it is all about.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SPIRITUAL AND MENTAL PREPARATION:</span></strong></p>
<p>The most important part of any preparation for the end times is to be prepared spiritually and mentally.  If we are settled in our soul and mind that we will follow and obey Jesus no matter what may come our way, and if we are convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that God’s will and plan for our lives is perfect even if it is uncomfortable, then we will be equipped to show forth a living testimony of faith no matter what our circumstances.  The following material deals with this spiritual and emotional mindset that we must have to witness effectively in the end times.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Job 13:15-16</span></strong></p>
<p>15 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him</span>.  Even so, I will defend my own ways before Him.  16 He also shall be my salvation, For a hypocrite could not come before Him.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mt 24:3-34</span></strong></p>
<p>3 Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “﻿Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?﻿”  4 And Jesus answered and said to them: “﻿Take heed that no one deceives you. 5 For many will come in My name, saying, ‘﻿I am the Christ,﻿’ and will deceive many. 6 And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. 8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">9 “﻿Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. 10 And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another. 11 Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many. 12 And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. 13 But he who endures to the end shall be saved.</span> 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come.  15 “﻿Therefore when you see the ‘﻿abomination of desolation,﻿’ spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place﻿” (whoever reads, let him understand), 16 “﻿then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. 17 Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. 18 And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes. 19 But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days! 20 And pray that your flight may not be in winter or on the Sabbath. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">21 For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the world until this time, no, nor ever shall be. 22 And unless those days were shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days will be shortened.</span>  23 “﻿Then if anyone says to you, ‘﻿Look, here is the Christ!﻿’ or ‘﻿There!﻿’ do not believe it. 24 For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. 25 See, I have told you beforehand.  26 “﻿Therefore if they say to you, ‘﻿Look, He is in the desert!﻿’ do not go out; or ‘﻿Look, He is in the inner rooms!﻿’ do not believe it.</p>
<p>27 For as the lightning comes from the east and flashes to the west, so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. 28 For wherever the carcass is, there the eagles will be gathered together.  29 “﻿Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. 30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. 31 And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">32 </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">“﻿Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near. </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">33 </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">So you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors! </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">34 </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">John 16:33</span></strong></p>
<p>33 These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.﻿</span></p>
<p><strong><em>In light of these things, we need to remember that we are not to let fear rule us as we consider these issues, because God is our Strength, Provider, and Protector!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exodus 14:10-14</span></strong></p>
<p>10 And when Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them. So they were very afraid, and the children of Israel cried out to the Lord. 11 Then they said to Moses, “﻿Because there were no graves in Egypt, have you taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why have you so dealt with us, to bring us up out of Egypt? 12 Is this not the word that we told you in Egypt, saying, ‘﻿Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians’? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.﻿”  13 And Moses said to the people, “﻿Do not be afraid. Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which He will accomplish for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today, you shall see again no more forever. 14 The Lord will fight for you, and you shall hold your peace.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Deuteronomy 31:8</span></strong></p>
<p>8 And the Lord, He is the One who goes before you. He will be with you, He will not leave you nor forsake you; do not fear nor be dismayed.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Joshua 1:9</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.﻿”</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Psalm 27:1-5</span></strong></p>
<p>1 The Lord is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear?  The Lord is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid?  2 When the wicked came against me To eat up my flesh, My enemies and foes, They stumbled and fell.  3 Though an army may  encamp against me, My heart shall not fear; Though war may rise against me, In this I will be confident.  4 One thing I have desired of the Lord, That will I seek: That I may dwell in the house of the Lord All the days of my life, To behold the beauty of the Lord, And to inquire in His temple.  5 For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; In the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Psalm 91:1-6</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>1 </strong>He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High Shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.  2 I will say of the Lord, “﻿He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.﻿”  3 Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler And from the perilous pestilence.  4 He shall cover you with His feathers, And under His wings you shall take refuge;</p>
<p>His truth shall be your shield and buckler.  5 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,</p>
<p>Nor of the arrow that flies by day,  6 Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Matthew 10:28-31</span></strong></p>
<p>28 And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. 29 Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin? And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will. 30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered. 31 Do not fear therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1<sup>st</sup> Peter 3:12-17</span></strong></p>
<p>12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, And His ears are open to their prayers;</p>
<p>But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.﻿”  13 And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? 14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you are blessed. “﻿And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled.﻿” 15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; 16 having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed. 17 For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil.</p>
<p>Now lets’ consider what Corrie Ten Boom wrote on the subject of Christians and the Tribulation.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Corrie Ten Boom-1974 </span></em></strong></p>
<p>“The world is deathly ill.  It is dying.  The Great Physician has already signed the death certificate.  Yet there is still a great work for Christians to do.  They are to be streams of living water, channels of mercy to those who are still in the world.  It is possible for them to do this because they are overcomers.  </p>
<p>Christians are ambassadors for Christ.  They are representatives from Heaven to this dying world.  And because of our presence here, things will change.</p>
<p>My sister, Betsy, and I were in the Nazi concentration camp at Ravensbruck because we committed the crime of loving Jews.  Seven hundred of us from Holland, France, Russia, Poland and Belgium were herded into a room built for two hundred.  As far as I knew, Betsy and I were the only two representatives of Heaven in that room.  </p>
<p>We may have been the Lord’s only representatives in that place of hatred, yet because of our presence there, things changed.  Jesus said, “In the world you shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”  We too, are to be overcomers – bringing the light of Jesus into a world filled with darkness and hate.</p>
<p>Sometimes I get frightened as I read the Bible, and as I look in this world and see all of the tribulation and persecution promised by the Bible coming true.  Now I can tell you, though, if you too are afraid, that I have just read the last pages.  I can now come to shouting “Hallelujah! Hallelujah!” for I have found where it is written that Jesus said, “He that overcometh shall inherit all things:  and I will be His God, and he shall be My son.”  This is the future and hope of this world.  Not that the world will survive – but that we shall be overcomers in the midst of a dying world.</p>
<p>Betsy and I, in the concentration camp, prayed that God would heal Betsy who was so weak and sick. “Yes, the Lord will heal me,”, Betsy said with confidence.  She died the next day and I could not understand it.  They laid her thin body on the concrete floor along  with all the other corpses of the women who died that day.</p>
<p>It was hard for me to understand, to believe that God had a purpose for all that.  Yet because of Betsy’s death, today I am traveling all over the world telling people about Jesus.</p>
<p>There are some among us teaching there will be no tribulation, that the Christians will be able to escape all this.  These are the false teachers that Jesus was warning us to expect in the latter days.  Most of them have little knowledge of what is already going on across the world.  I have been in countries where the saints are already suffering terrible persecution.  In China, the Christians were told, “Don’t worry, before the tribulation comes you will be translated – raptured.”  Then came a terrible persecution.  Millions of Christians were tortured to death.  Later I heard a Bishop from China say, sadly, “We have failed.  We should have made the people strong for persecution rather than telling them Jesus would come first.  Tell the people how to be strong in times of persecution, how to stand when the tribulation comes – to stand and not faint.”</p>
<p>I feel I have a divine mandate to go and tell the people of this world that it is possible to be strong in the Lord Jesus Christ.  We are in training for the tribulation, but more than sixty percent of the Body of Christ across the world has already entered into the tribulation. There is no way to escape it.  We are next.</p>
<p>Since I have already gone through prison for Jesus’ sake, and since I met the Bishop in China, now every time I read a good Bible text I think, “Hey, I can use that in the time of tribulation.”  Then I write it down and learn it by heart.  </p>
<p>When I was in the concentration camp, a camp where only twenty percent of the women came out alive, we tried to cheer each other up by saying, “Nothing could be any worse than today.”  But we would find the next day was even worse.  During this time a Bible verse that I had committed to memory gave me great hope and joy. “If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you; on their part evil is spoken of, but on your part He is glorified.” (I Peter 3:14)  I found myself saying, “Hallelujah!  Because I am suffering, Jesus is glorified!”</p>
<p>In America, the churches sing, “Let the congregation escape tribulation”, but in China  and Africa the tribulation has already arrived.  This last year alone more than two hundred thousand Christians were martyred in Africa.  Now things like that never get into the newspapers because they cause bad political relations.  But I know.  I have been there.  We need to think about that when we sit down in our nice houses with our nice clothes to eat our steak dinners.  Many, many members of the Body of Christ are being tortured to death at this very moment, yet we continue right on as though we are all going to escape the tribulation.</p>
<p>Several years ago I was in Africa in a nation where a new government had come into power.  The first night I was there some of the Christians were commanded to come to the police station to register.  When they arrived they were arrested and that same night they were executed.  The next day the same thing happened with other Christians.  The third day it was the same.  All the Christians in the district were being systematically murdered.</p>
<p>The fourth day  I was to speak in a little church.  The people came, but they were filled with fear and tension.  All during the service they were looking at each other, their eyes asking, “Will this one I am sitting beside be the next one killed?  Will I be the next one?”</p>
<p>The room was hot and stuffy with insects that came through the screenless windows and swirled around the naked bulbs over the bare wooden benches.  I told them a story out of my childhood.</p>
<p>“When I was a little girl, “ I said, “I went to my father and said, “Daddy, I am afraid that I will never be strong enough to be a martyr for Jesus Christ.” “Tell me,” said Father, “When you take a train trip to Amsterdam, when do I give you the money for the ticket? Three weeks before?”  “No, Daddy, you give me the money for the ticket just before we get on the train.” “That is right,” my father said, “and so it is with God’s strength.  Our Father in Heaven knows when you will need the strength to be a martyr for Jesus Christ.  He will supply all you need – just in time…”</p>
<p>My African friends were nodding and smiling.  Suddenly a spirit of joy descended upon that church and the people began singing, “ In the sweet, by and by, we shall meet on that beautiful shore.”  Later that week, half the congregation of that church was executed.  I heard later that the other half was killed some months ago.</p>
<p>But I must tell you something.  I was so happy that the Lord used me to encourage these people, for unlike many of their leaders, I had the word of God.  I had been to the Bible and discovered that Jesus said He had not only overcome the world, but to all those who remained faithful to the end, He would give a crown of life.</p>
<p>How can we get ready for the persecution?  First we need to feed on the word of God, digest it, make it a part of our being.  This will mean disciplined Bible study each day as we not only memorize long passages of scripture, but put the principles to work in our lives.</p>
<p>Next we need to develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.  Not just the Jesus of yesterday, the Jesus of History, but the life-changing Jesus of today who is still alive and sitting at the right hand of God.</p>
<p>We must be filled with the Holy Spirit. This is no optional command of the Bible, it is absolutely necessary. Those earthly disciples could never have stood up under the persecution of the Jews and Romans had they not waited for Pentecost.  Each of us needs our own personal Pentecost, the baptism of the Holy Spirit.  We will never be able to stand in the tribulation without it.</p>
<p>In the coming persecution we must be ready to help each other and encourage each other.  But we must not wait until the tribulation comes before starting.  The fruit of the Spirit should be the dominant force of every Christian’s life.  </p>
<p>Many are fearful of the coming tribulation, they want to run.  I, too, and a little bit afraid when I think that after all my eighty years, including the horrible nazi concentration camp, that I might have to go through the tribulation also.  But then I read the Bible and I am glad.</p>
<p>When I am weak, then I shall be strong, the Bible says. Betsy and I were prisoners for the Lord, we were so weak, but we got power because the Holy Spirit was on us.  That mighty inner strengthening of the Holy Spirit helped us through.  No, you will not be strong in yourself when the tribulation comes.  Rather, you will be strong in the power of Him who will not forsake you.  For seventy-six years I have known the Lord Jesus and not once has He ever left me, or let me down.  Though He slay me, yet will I trust Him, for I know that to all who overcome, He shall give the crown of life.  Hallelujah!”</p>
<p>Now let’s consider what the Bible says in regards to tribulation as opposed to God’s wrath.<br />
Will Christians Go Through the Great Tribulation?by <a href="http://www.godandscience.org/contact.html">Rich Deem</a><br />
There is, and always has been great interest in the second coming of Christ within the Christian community. Before this century, the predominant interpretation of end-times events included a post tribulation rapture (removal of Christians from the Earth) of Christ&#8217;s church. However, this interpretation has become unpopular recently, and has been replaced with a pre-tribulation rapture interpretation, which includes at least two &#8220;second comings&#8221; of Jesus &#8211; one to rapture believers and a second to defeat the forces of evil and establish His millennial kingdom on Earth. After years of studying this issue, I have great concern for the preparedness of Christians in the days to come. A pre-tribulation rapture scenario has much more appeal for Christians (since Christ delivers us before all the bad things begin to happen). However, if this interpretation is inaccurate, it can lead to a false sense of security, and a falling away by many if persecution of believers reaches unprecedented proportions before Christ&#8217;s return.</p>
<p>In this study, we will examine what the Bible says about the rapture (the word itself is never directly used), tribulation events, God&#8217;s wrath, and God&#8217;s judgment. My goal is to include all relevant verses, so as not to bias the data. Once we have all the data, we will examine rapture interpretations to determine which scenario fits the data the best.</p>
<h3><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tribulation vs. Wrath</span></em></h3>
<p>First, I think it is important to define the word &#8220;tribulation&#8221; and how this is related to God&#8217;s wrath (anger and judgment). There are two Greek words most often used to describe tribulation events, and in many instances, they are used together in the same verse. The first word is diwgmos (Strong&#8217;s #G1375), which occurs 10 times in the New Testament and is translated &#8220;persecution(s)&#8221; in all major English translations. This word always refers to the persecution of believers by non-believers. The second word is thlipsis (Strong&#8217;s #G2347), which occurs 45 times in the New Testament and is translated &#8220;tribulation(s),&#8221; &#8220;affliction(s),&#8221; &#8220;anguish,&#8221; &#8220;distress,&#8221; &#8220;persecution,&#8221; or &#8220;trouble.&#8221; In 42 of these 45 occurrences, the word refers to the suffering believers received at the hands of non-believers. One of the other 3 refer to the sufferings of Joseph when he was sold into slavery at the hands of his brothers, another to the sufferings of people during the famine of that time, and only one refers to the suffering of those who commit evil. On this basis alone, one would seem to be on shaky ground in assuming that the tribulation is reserved only for non-believers (since it only refers to non-believers in only 2% of all verses).</p>
<p>In contrast, two different Greek words are used to describe the suffering of non-believers at the hand of God. The first word is thumos (Strong&#8217;s #G2372), which occurs in 18 verses in the New Testament and is translated &#8220;angry tempers,&#8221; &#8220;fierce,&#8221; &#8220;indignation,&#8221; &#8220;outbursts of anger,&#8221; &#8220;passion,&#8221; &#8220;rage,&#8221; and &#8220;wrath.&#8221; In nine of those 18 verses, the term specifically refers to the anger and judgment of God against the unrighteous (the other 9 refer to the anger of people against each other). The second word is orgay (Strong&#8217;s #G3709), which occurs in 34 verses in the New Testament and is translated &#8220;anger&#8221; or &#8220;wrath.&#8221; Twenty-eight of those verses refer to the wrath of God (or Jesus against the unrighteous, one refers to the persecution of believers, and five refer to anger of people against each other.) Therefore, whereas tribulation almost always refers to the persecution of believers, wrath almost always refers to the anger of God against the unrighteous that results in punishment.</p>
<h3><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Events Preceding the End</span></em></h3>
<p>Three of the four gospels tell of Jesus&#8217; description of the end time events. In addition, the book of Revelation describes these events in some detail (although not completely in a sequential order). The major events of these end times prophecies are included in the table below.</p>

<h3>The Rapture</h3>
<p>God promises to remove believers from the Earth prior to the time that He executes judgment against the unrighteous. The removal of believers prior to God&#8217;s judgment has been called the rapture. Descriptions of the return of Christ and the rapture are found in three of the four gospels, the book of Acts, 1 Thessalonians, and the book of Revelation. It is mentioned in many other letters to the churches, but no significant additional information is included.</p>
<p>The descriptions given in the gospels are sequential, since many verses indicate a sense of order:</p>
<p>Matthew 24:6 &#8211; &#8220;&#8230;but that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not yet</span> the end&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew 24:8 &#8211; &#8220;But all these things are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">merely the beginning</span>&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew 24:14 &#8211; &#8220;And this gospel &#8230; shall be preached in the whole world&#8230;, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then</span> the   </p>
<p>                             end shall come&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew 24:29 &#8211; &#8220;But <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediately after</span> the tribulation of those days&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Matthew 24:30 &#8211; &#8220;and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">then</span> the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Parallel passages in the other gospel indicate similar references to sequential events. The order of events clearly indicates that believers will go through the Great Tribulation. In addition, the text indicates that the days of tribulation (persecution of believers by non-believers) will be shortened by the Lord &#8220;for the sake of the elect&#8221; (i.e., believers). The Lord will announce His coming through astronomical signs and quickly gather together &#8220;His elect&#8221; (the rapture). Following these events, the wrath of God will be executed against the remaining non-believers.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation likewise indicates that believers will go through the tribulation. In chapter 6, believers killed for their faith ask how long it will be before God avenges their death. The answer is that they have to wait even until more believers are killed for their faith. Not only will believers be persecuted for their faith, but also they will be killed because they are Christians (Revelation 6:11). This tribulation will be followed astronomical signs and the &#8220;sealing&#8221; of 144,000 Jewish men who seem to be future Christian evangelists. Immediately after these men are &#8220;sealed&#8221;, &#8220;a great multitude, which no one could count, from every nation and all tribes and peoples and tongues&#8221; suddenly appear in heaven (from the rapture). When one of the elders asks who all these people are, John answers that they are those &#8220;who come out of the great tribulation.&#8221; Immediately after the rapture, the seventh seal is broken, and there is silence in heaven for 30 minutes before the wrath of God is poured out on the Earth.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p>From these studies, one can see that there is a significant difference between the wrath of God (which is judgment directed at the unrighteous) and the tribulation (which is the persecution directed at believers). Throughout the Bible, God is consistent in His treatment of humans. He allows individuals to choose between love and hate, and rarely interferes with that choice. At the times of the end, God will allow the unrighteous to persecute believers to an extent that &#8220;has not occurred since the beginning of the world until now, nor ever shall,&#8221; before ending their reign of terror. God then removes believers from the earth before executing judgment on the unrighteous. A complete description of this judgment can be found in the remainder of the book of Revelation (chapters 8-19). The ultimate fate of unbelievers can be found in chapter 20 of Revelation.<sup> </sup></p>
<p>I am more convinced than ever that Christians will go through the Great Tribulation. Since much of the Church believes God will deliver them prior to the Great Tribulation, many believers will be surprised when they find themselves being persecuted and killed for their faith. Their faith will be severely tested, since they may believe that God has abandoned them and that the prophecies of the rapture are not true. Under such circumstances, most believers will fall away and deny their faith to save their lives. Jesus, in fact, made just such a prophecy:</p>
<p>&#8220;And at that time many will fall away and will deliver up one another and hate one another&#8230;. &#8220;But the one who endures to the end, he shall be saved. (Matthew 24:10, 13)</p>
<p>If you are a Christian, be prepared to die for your faith. Even your fellow &#8220;brothers&#8221; will deliver you to the authorities to avoid their own deaths. If you are not willing to die for what you believe, you will deny your faith when threatened with death. Be aware of what Jesus said about those who seek to save their lives:</p>
<p>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will find it. (Matthew 16:25)</p>
<p>Many Christians are looking forward to the return of Christ, which will, indeed, be a glorious event. However, the time just preceding the end will not be pleasant for Christians. The watchful Christian should be prepared to join his fellow brothers under the altar of souls of those who will die &#8220;because of the testimony which they had maintained.&#8221;</p>
<p>We also see in Scripture that God has given us a blueprint, or outline, of the events of the Tribulation as it applies to Christians.</p>
<h4>The Exodus as a blueprint for the Tribulation: Summarized from material by M. Judah</h4>
<p><strong><em>The Book of Exodus contains the blueprint for the last generation saints to endure the great tribulation until the Messiah comes.</em></strong> It is the story of the exodus from Egypt to the Promised Land; it is the pattern for the greater exodus from this world to the Messiah’s Kingdom.</p>
<p>Moses wrote a song of deliverance (Exodus 15) at the first Exodus. Upon crossing the Red Sea and seeing Pharaoh’s chariots drowned, he sang that song – the song of Moses. I’m sure you have heard the words, &#8220;The horse and rider He has thrown into the sea.&#8221; But, did you know that Moses wrote a second song. The second song is also a song of deliverance and according the book of Revelation, it will be sung along with the song of the Lamb by tribulation saints at the end of the age. The second song of Moses (Deuteronomy 32) is for the greater Exodus. <em>And they sang the song of Moses the bond-servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, &#8220;Great and marvelous are Thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; Righteous and true are Thy ways, Thou King of the nations. Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? For Thou alone art holy; For all the nations will come and worship before Thee, For Thy righteous acts have been revealed.&#8221; REVELATION 15:3-4</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>The children of Israel left Egypt with the clear expectation that they were going to the promised land – the land of milk and honey. However, they did not go directly to that land. Instead, they went into the great, terrible wilderness for 40 year and camped at 42 different places. Then, they came to the Jordan river and crossed over to the promised land.  Whereas, Israel camped 42 times, our tribulation is 42 months. The Hebrew word for Egypt is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Mitzrayim</span></strong>. It means trials and tribulations.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lets look at some of the comparisons between the Exodus and the “FINAL” exodus</span></strong>:</p>
<p> <strong>Pharaoh and the Anti-Christ:  </strong>Pharaoh hardened his heart against the Lord and great judgment befell Egypt.  The Antichrist will also harden his heart against God and not remember the son of Joseph (Jesus the Messiah). Great judgments will befall the world and the Antichrist so that everyone will &#8220;know the Lord.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Moses and Aaron – the two witnesses </strong>Moses and Aaron went into Pharaoh and spoke the Lord’s will, &#8220;Let My people go.&#8221; With each refusal, Moses and Aaron pronounced God’s judgments upon Egypt and Pharaoh. In like manner, we will have two witnesses prophesying in Jerusalem, pronouncing judgments upon the world, and warning the people, &#8220;Behold, Here is your God!&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>God’s Judgments as Sets </strong>The ten plagues that hit Egypt were three sets of three judgments with a final judgment. They can be identified by where Moses was when the judgment is brought forth. Beginning with the first judgment, water into blood, the judgments came forth in this manner: At the river Nile, at the Palace, then unannounced. This pattern repeats itself through the first nine. Therefore, the judgments were actually three sets of three each. It is not that the judgments announced at the river Nile happened first then all the Palace announcements happened, etc. They were integrated with each other. In like manner, we can see that the future Revelation judgments are three sets of seven.</p>
<p><strong>The Locusts and Darkness Judgment </strong>Judgement number eight and nine in ancient Egypt were particularly difficult. These preceded the final judgment. God demonstrates His great wisdom and judgment by doing the same with us in the great tribulation. In the final days of the tribulation, an asteroid, meteor, or comets strike the earth in a deep impact scenario. According to the prophet Joel and John, great clouds billow up to darken the sun, moon, and stars. All the prophets have spoken of the world being in darkness before the coming of the Lord – in the final days of the indignation. From the abyss in the earth, demons come forth in this darkness to terrorize men. They are compared to locusts, following in mass and devastating everything in their path.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>The 10 Tests in the Wilderness </strong>Israel was purposely tested in the wilderness. God wanted to transform the people and teach them to trust Him. <em>And you shall remember all the way which the Lord your God has led you in the wilderness these forty years, that He might humble you, testing you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not. And He humbled you and let you be hungry, and fed you with manna which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that He might make you understand that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord. Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your foot swell these forty years. Thus you are to know in your heart that the Lord your God was disciplining you just as a man disciplines his son. DEUTERONOMY 8:2-5 </em>Beginning with the crossing of the Red Sea and ending with Israel’s rejection at Kadesh-Barnea, Israel failed 10 tests.</p>
<p>These tests are summarized by two categories (belief and obedience) as the following questions:</p>
<p> <em>Belief and Trust: </em>1. Will God save us from Pharaoh (Antichrist)?</p>
<p>                             2. Will God provide water?</p>
<p>                             3. Will God provide food?</p>
<p>                             4. Will God be with us to defend us?</p>
<p>                             5. Is God the One and only, true God? <em> </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Obedience and Blessing:</em> 6. Will we reject God’s provision?</p>
<p>                                        7. Will we reject God’s presence?</p>
<p>                                        8. Will we reject God’s salvation?</p>
<p>                                        9. Will we reject God&#8217;s Anointed?</p>
<p>                                       10. Will we reject God’s Kingdom?</p>
<p>At the Red Sea, Pharaoh and his chariots approached to slaughter the Children of Israel. The unbelievers cried out that Moses had brought them out to die. But Moses answered and told the people to be quiet and see the salvation of God. God led them through the Red Sea and drowned the Egyptians before their eyes. When the great tribulation comes, the first test will be whether God will save us from the Antichrist and his chariots. Many believers have been told that the Antichrist will be very powerful in the world. The Antichrist will be given power for a specific period; however, our God will not forsake us nor abandon us to the enemy. He is a savior and His arm is not short to deliver those who take refuge in Him. The Apostle Paul makes reference to these tests explaining that they are to teach us. He also says they are intended for the people at the end of the ages (the last generation). <em>Now these things happened to them as an example, and they were written for our instruction, upon whom the ends of the ages have come. 1<sup>st</sup> COR. 10:11</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Wanting to return to Egypt </strong>It didn’t take long before the children of Israel began to mumble and grumble among themselves. The accommodations were not all that great. Food and water were questionable. Eventually, Moses’ leadership came into question. They complained that in Egypt they had cucumbers, melons, leeks and garlic; in the wilderness, all they had was manna. They also had taken a lot of gold from Egypt. What could they spend their gold on out in the wilderness? All of this led to various groups and individuals rising up in opposition saying that they should return to Egypt. In like manner, I can assure you that these very issues will present themselves in the great tribulation in the camp of believers. They will get hungry for McDonald’s french fries, Chinese take-out, and pizza delivery. What’s more, many believers will bring money with them, but there won’t be anywhere to spend it in the camp. The temptation will come and our own brethren will rise in opposition to camp leadership. The issue won’t be the leaders; the issue will be money, and they will want to go spend it back in the cities.</p>
<p><strong>For the Fear of our Children </strong>The greatest concern and most difficult issue for Israel in the wilderness was preparing to enter the land of Israel. When the spies returned and said, &#8220;There are giants in the land,&#8221; the people believed that their enemies would kill their children. For this reason, they would not trust the Lord despite all that the Lord had done and shown them. In like manner, we will face our greatest test in believing that the Lord will protect and care for our children. The children of Israel didn’t believe the Lord; they were judged for their unbelief and disobedience in refusing to enter the land. So God took their children and took the land with them. The parents died one by one in the wilderness.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong>Crossing the River Jordan </strong>When Israel crossed the Jordan river, they entered the promised land as a nation. They had leaders, laws, and land. The Angel of the Lord went before them. They were no longer slaves to Egypt. They were a free people with a covenant from God. In like manner, we will be resurrected from the dead or changed by the rapture. We will have new bodies. We will have Jesus with us.  We will no longer be slaves to sin and the world; we will be free and servants of the Living God. We will receive another covenant – the covenant of peace. <em>And I will make a covenant of peace with them; it will be an everlasting covenant with them. And I will place them and multiply them, and will set My sanctuary in their midst forever. My dwelling place also will be with them; and I will be their God, and they will be My people. EZEKIEL 37:26-27 </em></p>

Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues.  You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles</span>.  But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">“﻿Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.  And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake.

<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>It is evident from Scripture that the enviroment of the world that the church will exist in during the “last days” will be a hostile one.  Dangerous times, persecution, betrayal by those we thought were our friends, imprisonment, and so on will be the norm.  We must be prepared to face those times with wisdom, spiritual maturity, and physical and emotional preparation.  In this section, we will discuss some of the “practical” aspects of life “underground” as a persecuted and “illegal” group.  These items are in no particular order, and should always be guided by the basic truth that no one can be prepared for every eventuality.  Also, our ultimate guide is God, not any booklet that a man has written.  Pray about these things and let God guide you as to what YOUR level of preparation should be, and how YOU should handle various situations.</p>
<p>Christians in Rome used to use the “fish” symbol as a means of identifying one another without openly declaring their Christianity.  One person would casually draw a curved line on the ground with their staff, or their foot.  Then, the other person (if a Christian) would draw the opposite curve, forming the “fish” or “icthus” symbol, which was a symbol for the name of Christ.  In this way, believers could identify each other on the “Q.T.”.   In the near future, we may have to once again use the methods of persecuted churches around the world to live, meet, minister, gather supplies, and evangelize here in the United States.</p>
<p>When your read that “Christians” or “Christian Fundamentalists” are singled out for some national ill, take heed. That is usually the first step in stirring up hatred against a particular group.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of Survival Basics</span></strong></p>
<p>We are living at the edge, and given the current state of affairs, we should be on guard. Once a scenario unfolds, it can progress at a frightening pace. Be prepared at all times.</p>
<p>•<strong><em>           </em></strong>Take stock of what you are eating, and take stock of what you have on hand. That will tell you how long you could survive if you cannot access the stores  tomorrow.<strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>•           What would you do for water if you cannot “participate” in the economy? Find what other sources you have, and have those sources tested.</p>
<p>•           What happens to your sewage? How would you cope if your system is disrupted?</p>
<p>•           Are you on medications? How long could you last without them? Do you have an alternate source for them? Always refill your prescriptions ahead of time. If questioned, just say that you are taking a trip. Have at least a month’s supply on hand if at all possible.</p>
<p>•           Is your vehicle ready to roll in case of an emergency? How much gas do you have? What about lubricants, brake fluid, spare parts?</p>
<p>•           Do you have a place to go? Do you know the topography of the area between your home and your place of retreat?</p>
<p>•           Do you have the knowledge to deal with emergencies? Do you have the skills to put the knowledge into practice?</p>
<p>•           Have you taken a first-aid course (or updated your certification) in the last five years? Do you have the supplies and instruments to give first aid?</p>
<p>•           Are you aware of what is happening in your community, your country, and in the world? Do you have radios, communication devices, and newsletters to keep you informed?</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bug Out Kit:  </span></em></strong>What is a “Bug out” kit?</p>
<p>A bug out kit is a fairly small, easy to carry container (such as a backpack) that contains basic survival and first aid supplies for 1 or 2 people, and can be kept packed so that it can simply be grabbed in a hurry when you have to “bug out”.  The contents of such a pack will vary based on your area, climate, needs, and personal preferences, and will be based on a 3-5 day duration, but would include such items as:</p>
<p>Water containers that can be quickly and easily filled in an emergency</p>
<p>Water purification supplies</p>
<p>Basic food, such as MRE’s, freeze-dried rations, or small canned/dry goods (rotated by date)</p>
<p>A change of clothing (rotated by season)</p>
<p>First aid supplies</p>
<p>A small supply of any medications that you need on a regular basis (rotated by date)</p>
<p>Extra eye-glasses</p>
<p>Shelter supplies (small tent, or a tarp for cover, etc.)</p>
<p>Map and compass</p>
<p>Knife (a Swiss army knife with several blades as well as some tools, and one larger “combat” style knife is a good mix)</p>
<p>Small Bible (or at least a “Gideon” New Testament and Psalms)</p>
<p>Flashlight or Cyalume lightsticks</p>
<p>Fire Starter, Waterproof Matches</p>
<p>Small Cooking Kit</p>
<p>The idea for this kit is to have a means of basic living in the event that you have to leave your home quickly.  Having a bug out kit is a good idea for a variety of emergencies, such as earthquake, biological problem (natural or manmade), or any of the events associated with persecution that would make it advisable to leave home quickly.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Water:</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Since a person can only live a few days without water, it is the most important consideration in survival once you have dealt with the immediate “bug out” situation.  We don’t realize the debt of gratitude that we owe to the civil engineers who have made it possible for most of us to have easy access to clean, purified water.  Lack of water, or lack of pure water, is responsible for untold thousands of deaths and illnesses in Third World nations.  If we have to “off the system”, we will need to address the issue of water immediately.  Fortunately, here in the Twin Lakes Area, we have lakes, ponds, springs, and other sources of water.  However, most of that water would need to be purified before it would be safe to drink or cook  with.  The following is just a very basic outline of information of the subject.  I recommend that you gather more detailed information on your own, to suit your own situation and resources.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">WATER ISSUES: From “The Complete Handbook Of Survival”</span></em></strong></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Summary of info. on water.</span></em></p>
<p>How much do you need <span style="text-decoration: underline;">per day</span>?  2 quarts minimum for drinking (more if exerting yourself, or in hot weather), and approximately 2 quarts for food preparation, basic hygiene (tooth brushing, “spit bath”, etc.) <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PER PERSON</span></strong>.</p>
<p>Quick easy way to purify water for general use. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(NOTE: this method doesn’t remove ALL contaminants)</span></strong>  UNSCENTED, PLAIN liquid Chlorine Bleach.  8 drops per gallon of water.  If water is cloudy, double amount of bleach.  Since bleach looses its strength over time, if bleach is over 1 year old, but less than 2 years old, double amount used.  If water is more than “cloudy” it must be filtered first until it is only cloudy, then apply bleach.  In all cases, after adding bleach, stir or shake thoroughly and let stand for 30-45 minutes.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Should I stockpile water? If so, how much? What a hassle! </strong></p>
<p>Hassle, yes. But look at it this way: the average, healthy human body can survive over a month without food, but only a few days without water. We are, after all, 65% water, and we lose water constantly through tears, sweat, urine, feces, and the vapor in our breath, to the tune of about 10 cups per day when we’re not active, and as much as three times that much when we’re doing strenuous things. It also takes a certain amount of extra water to allow us to digest the food we eat—more water for dry foods such as grains and breads and meats, less water for wet foods such as stews and vegetables and puddings. So, how much water do we need to store? The rule of thumb is to figure a gallon per person per day, which should cover drinking water, cooking water, brushing teeth, and face-washing. For bathing and doing laundry, add another gallon per person per day. (I’m assuming you won’t all shower and do laundry every day, and unless your hands are really mucky, a communal bucket of heated water can be used to wash several pairs, several times.) That’s a lot of water, and it’s an important commodity, probably the most important thing you can have in your stockpile.</p>
<p><strong>How should I store water? How long will it “﻿keep﻿”?</strong></p>
<p>You can store water in small, easy-to-handle containers such as 1/2-gallon to 2-gallon containers, or you can store it in huge, 50- to 100-gallon cisterns which are hooked up to your regular plumbing system (the water is always being circulated and replaced as long as your regular water supply is running). The advantage of the smaller containers is cost and manageability: the cost is nil, if you’re recycling juice or soda containers you’re keeping them out of the landfill, and the smaller jugs are easy to carry around. Water is really heavy. Just think what it is like to carry two gallons of milk into the house—you know how heavy it gets when you have to lug them very far! The disadvantage is, it’s a bit of a hassle finding truly safe containers in which to store your water (the debate on plastics, which reportedly can leach small amounts of toxic chemicals into stored water, rages on).</p>
<p>No matter which storage method you choose, you’ll have to make sure the water is purified so it’s free of toxins and potentially harmful organisms. Properly purified and stored water can be kept indefinitely. The current recommendation for safe containers includes glass, polyethylene, polyester, or metallized polyester. I’m reluctant to recommend glass because of the obvious risk of breakage, which not only creates a mess and wastes your precious water, but also carries a real risk of injury in a cold, dark storage room while juggling with a flashlight. Personally, I like to use the two-liter soda bottles and the half-gallon plastic juice bottles (like those in which you buy apple or cranberry juice), which my family goes through by the dozens. Again, it depends on whom you ask, but most of the opinions I’ve gathered have indicated that the milky, nubbly type of plastic (such as the one-gallon milk jugs) are not good because the plastic, designed to break down faster in landfills, deteriorates too quickly. Smooth, shiny, clear plastic, such as in soda bottles and fruit juice bottles is better.</p>
<p>Whatever you use, it should be thoroughly cleaned in sudsy water, rinsed well, and air-dried before filling to within an inch of the top with purified water (your choice of filtered, distilled, or chemically treated) and securely capped (don’t forget to wash, rinse, and thoroughly clean the caps as well).</p>
<p>Adding three to four drops of non-scented chlorine bleach per two-liter bottle is a very cheap way to make sure you have water on hand. (I recommend this even for water you are storing for washing and the like.)</p>
<p><strong>I tried drinking some water I’d stored for several months, and it tasted “﻿flat.﻿” Any suggestions?</strong></p>
<p>After storage, water usually tastes “﻿flat.﻿” The way it was explained to me, this is due to lack of oxygen. You can remedy this by shaking the bottle or pouring the water from one container to another, re-incorporating air back into it—this should help it taste fresh again. Another solution is to add Kool-Aid or other flavorings. I bought a large container of Tang with extra vitamin C, so not only will the water taste good, but your family will get some vitamins, too.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I need to “﻿purify﻿” the water that comes out of my faucet, if we usually drink it “﻿as is﻿” all the time anyway? What if it already has chlorine in it, thanks to the water treatment folks in my city? How do I purify it myself, assuming this is something I need to do?</strong></p>
<p>Even if your tap water is drinkable “﻿as is,﻿” it’s likely to contain low levels of pathogens (potential disease-causing germs) that could thrive and multiply in long-term storage conditions, causing your water to become fouled and possibly even dangerous. When officials check the public water supply in your community, they’re not making sure it’s absolutely free of pathogens—they’re simply making sure the level of pathogens in the water is low enough so that it’s not likely to make anybody sick under normal circumstances. This is equally, if not more, true of well water and spring water.</p>
<p>About chlorine: Water that’s already chlorinated, as is the case in many large cities, is not necessarily purified with respect to pathogens. One very significant pathogen (called Cryptosporidium) isn’t killed by chlorine at all—in fact, lab tests have shown that some strains of “﻿Crypto﻿” actually thrive in it. An outbreak of Cryptosporidiosis, with diarrhea and nausea, occurred several years ago in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for that very reason. So, if you live in an area where the water supply is at risk of Crypto-sporidium contamination (usually that means there is farming nearby), chlorine simply won’t be good enough. If you were planning to rely on chlorine to purify your water, call your local public health department to find out if there have been any reports of Cryptosporidium in the past few years. And, if your water source or public storage facility is near a farm with livestock, particularly cattle, don’t rely on chlorine to purify your water, because the domestic cow is a common carrier of Cryptosporidium. If your water isn’t contaminated with it today, it could easily be contaminated next month. All it takes is a new, carrier cow arriving on the farm.</p>
<p>Another thing about pre-chlorinated water is the fact that the levels of chlorine might not be sufficient to eliminate pathogens that contaminate the water after it leaves the central reservoir. Leaky pipes along the way, and any contamination and sediment that might be present in pipes, valves and storage tanks anywhere between the reservoir and the tip of your faucet, might overwhelm its ability to kill off even the daintiest of germs.</p>
<p>The bottom line on water is, you have to nip those pathogens in the bud, before they take over the water you plan to put into storage. I encourage you to do some research of your own to find the method that works best for you. Following are some of the methods I have learned about in my own research. Obviously, after purifying your water, you should store it in containers that won’t reverse the process by adding contaminants and toxins back into the water.</p>
<p>•     <strong><em>Boil it</em></strong>. It’s time consuming, a real hassle, and not totally infallible (some pathogens actually can survive boiling, but they’re usually not an issue in this country). The water must boil vigorously for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>•     <strong><em>Filter it</em></strong>, with a countertop or built-in faucet filter (such as the Brita water pitcher, available in grocery stores and variety stores everywhere). The Brita filters and others like them are marketed as a way to make tap water taste purer, and they even remove some chemical contaminants such as lead, but they don’t claim to make contaminated water safe. This can be a problem if your water source, and/or your plumbing pipes, already contain some organisms that are too small to be trapped by the filter, such as certain bacteria and viruses. If you have any doubts, shop around for a finer filter that is warranted to remove pathogens, and/or get your tap water tested at your local public health department first—if it gets a clean bill of health, it should be okay to use a Brita-type countertop filter as your main mode of purification unless things get really bad. All water filters are meant to be replaced at regular intervals (and sooner if you use them “﻿a lot,﻿” which isn’t defined in the literature that comes with the Brita filter)—if you try to pinch pennies and keep a filter past its scheduled discard date, two things can happen: First, it could become clogged with the crud it has removed from your water, making it work very slowly, which is a pain when you’re trying to put away a lot of water. Second, the crud that naturally accumulates in the filter (instead of going into your water) can become colonized with germs and actually become a source of contamination, a problem that becomes more and more of a probability the longer you keep the filter. So, be diligent about changing filters when you’re making purified water for storage. And remember that if you’re using water of questionable integrity to begin with, this sort of filtration may not be adequate.</p>
<p>•     <strong><em>Filter it, with a millipore filter:</em></strong> These are available in desktop models or in a hand-pump-style carried by hikers for purifying water they find along the trail. Because they’re able to trap even smaller germs than the countertop filters are, they’re marketed as a means of purifying water that’s contaminated and should be fine for your purposes here. And, like the countertop filters, they’ll also remove some chemical contaminants, such as lead, pesticides, detergents, and even chlorine (which chemicals they remove depends on the size of the chemical’s molecules). The desktop model I’m aware of is called Amritt Vitae, available from DSK Medical Products for about $20 (for orders call 949–588–1170). Replacement filters cost about $5. The campers﻿’ models, such as the Katadyn, are available in stores and catalogs that carry camping, hunting and hiking gear, such as L.L. Bean (800–221–4221), Mountain Gear (800–829–2009), Cabela’s (800–237–4444), and Eddie Bauer (800–426–8020). Cost ranges from $35 to $200, and replacement filters range from $10 to an unbelievable $50. For me, the biggest disadvantage is that they’re relatively slow—some brag about taking “﻿as little as﻿” 4 minutes for 1 gallon of water, which feels like a long time if you have to stand there and pump the water in (I don’t know about you, but I don’t have that sort of patience). But they really work well, and for a single drink, they’re terrific. The filter I have is the British Berkefeld Water Filter—removes parasites and pathogens, as well as undesirable odors and flavors: $259.00. Each filter includes four silver-impregnated ceramic filter elements. Additional replacement elements are available for just $35.00 each. (See recommendations at the end of the book.)</p>
<p>•     <strong><em>Add chlorine bleach</em></strong> (the laundry type, without added colors, scents, or other stuff. Pure sodium hypochlorite is what you’re looking for). The USDA recommendation is 1/4 teaspoon per gallon of water (or I use about three to four drops per two-liter bottle). It’s easy and quick, but not totally infallible. Chlorine does not remove toxins and chemical contaminants, and in the eyes of many it is, in and of itself, a toxic contaminant. For folks who believe added chlorine is a health risk, this method can be combined with filtration, using the filter of your choice to remove the chlorine after 30 minutes (which should give it enough time to kill most common germs).</p>
<p>•     <strong><em>Add iodine water purification pellets</em></strong>. It’s easy, quick, and very effective (but be warned that it tastes pretty awful). Before millipore filters were available in gadgets small enough for backpackers, iodine pellets were the standard for backcountry water purification. They’re available in stores and catalogs that carry camping, hunting and hiking gear, and a bottle of 50 pellets costs about $5. (It takes 1 pellet to treat a quart of water.) Iodine won’t get rid of chemical contaminants, and as you may have guessed, there are folks who quiver at the prospect of drinking water with this stuff added to it. Again, filtration after the iodine pellet has had time to work (30 minutes should do it) can help remove most of the additive, leaving the water pure as long as the filter is clean.</p>
<p>•     <strong><em>The Steri-Pen</em></strong> is a neat new gadget that’ll work great for a single glass. It’s about the size of an electric toothbrush, and its battery will last for about 30 treatments. The business end emits ultraviolet light which, when immersed in your glass for 30 seconds, kills germs, including Giardia, E. coli, tiny viruses, and Cryptosporidia. In fact, on a larger scale, ultraviolet light is used to sterilize commercially bottled water (again, it won’t get rid of chemical contaminants). The Steri-Pen will be available in early 1999 from the manufacturer (Hydro-Photon, 207–374–5800) for about $200.</p>
<p>•     <strong><em>Distill it</em></strong>. This process removes just about all contaminants, including sediments, dissolved solids, heavy pesticides, herbicides, and even volatile gases. The trouble is, it’s quite slow (about 6 hours per gallon with the countertop distiller I found) and expensive, compared to some of the simpler methods of purification. Still, a lot of people swear by this method, though some people complain that by removing the minerals from the water, they’re leaving us at risk for mineral deficiency! I figure we get plenty of minerals in good food and a good quality vitamin-mineral supplement, and somewhere along the line you’ve got to stop worrying about stuff! I found a nice distiller, called the EcoWater Distiller, in the Harmony catalog (800–869–3446) for $200, plus $13 for the filters it uses, and $14 for stuff to clean the scum that comes out of your water and adheres to the interior of the machine.</p>
<p>•     <strong><em>Buy commercially bottled water</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>How can we bathe if there’s no running water, let alone HOT water?!</strong></p>
<p>This is actually a fairly simple problem to take care of with minimal pre-planning. In camping stores or catalogs, and even in some of the larger variety stores, there are simple gadgets called “﻿sun showers.﻿” They’re a plastic bag, covered with a dark-colored nylon bag that has a fabric handle on one end and a spigot on the other, affixed with a rubber hose and a cute little shower head. The bags hold a gallon or two of water, depending on what you buy. Here’s what you do: Heat some water in a teapot or kettle until it’s just a little warmer than you like for your bath. Using a funnel so you don’t spill, fill your shower bag with the hot water. Some of the heat will be absorbed by the cold fabric and by the slight delay before you get naked, but you’ll still want to make sure the water has cooled enough so you don’t get scalded. Hang the shower bag from your regular shower head (if it wants to slip off, take a thick rubber band from your newspaper and wrap it around the metal shower head’s neck a few times—this will serve as a stopper for your sun shower’s handle). Set a lantern in a safe place on your bathroom sink where it won’t get knocked off or start a fire. Then climb in the shower. Open the spigot to get yourself and your soap wet, then shut it off. Soap up then rinse yourself off. You’ll be amazed at how refreshing it is to shower this way, in a chilly bathroom, with hot water! And believe it or not, there’s usually plenty of water not only to bathe your body, but also to shampoo and rinse your hair. For those of you with really long hair or a predisposition to take LONG showers, buy a couple of sun showers and fill them both. That way, you’ll be sure to have enough hot water to rinse thoroughly.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Food:</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Food is essential in all the scenarios. Your choice of provisions will play a large part in how you come through a situation. You should plan your rations. Have foods that are ready to eat, have some that take minimal preparation, and have some that are suitable for a base camp where you will have time to cook. Whether you use a camp stove or open fire will also affect the type of food you are eating. If cooking on a stove, you will be limited to one-pot meals unless you have a lot of time. A campfire lets you heat more than one pot at a time and is much more suitable for baking.</p>
<p>The weight of the food is another important aspect of rationing, particularly on longer treks. Compare the calories against the weight of the food you intend to bring. Dried foods are usually the best as they are light and won’t spoil in warm weather. Freeze-dried foods, which contain only 2 percent of the original moisture, are often lighter than dried foods, in which 25 percent of the moisture can remain. How food is packaged also affects weight.</p>
<p>The amount of food a person needs each day depends on a variety of factors. First, the intensity and amount of activity you are doing will be the major influence on how much fuel you burn. Another factor is age. An active, young person will burn food quicker than someone who is older or heavier. The height and weight of a person are other factors in the amount of food an individual needs. The outside temperature also influences fuel consumption as the body uses energy to keep warm on cold days. Due to these variables, it is difficult to recommend a precise amount of food. But as a rough figure, a person participating in outdoor activities will need between 2,500 and 3,500 calories per day. This works out to approximately two pounds of food.</p>
<p>Food consists of three main components: fats, carbohydrates, and proteins. All provide essential energy, but are assimilated and used differently. Vitamins and minerals are also essential to long-term survival, but short-term deficiencies are not likely to cause serious harm.</p>
<p>Carbohydrates are the food most quickly turned into energy and should thus compose the bulk of your diet, about 65 percent, when exercising. There are two types of carbohydrates: complex, which are starches such as grains and vegetables, and simple, which consist of sugars like sucrose and honey. Complex carbohydrates are the best fuel for strenuous activities because they provide more energy over a longer period. Simple carbohydrates give bursts of energy that burn off quickly.</p>
<p>Fats, which are present in foods like eggs, nuts, meat, and milk products, should compose about 25 percent of your daily calories. Increase this amount by about 10 percent in winter because fats have an important role in making the body tissues less sensitive to cold.</p>
<p>Protein, the raw material that renews the body’s cells, is contained in food such as meat, beans, and nuts. Although protein is crucial to survival, it should compose only about 10 to 20 percent of your diet.</p>
<p>Modern prepared foods have excellent shelf lives. Some examples are shown below:</p>

<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sleeping, Clothing, and Shelter:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sleeping bags</em></strong></p>
<p>There was a time when buying a sleeping bag was simple—get the traditional duck pattern or opt for the ever-popular guns-and-fishing-poles design. Today, there is much more to consider.</p>
<p>•     Comfort rating</p>
<p>•     Type of fill</p>
<p>•     Shape and construction</p>
<p>•     Weight and compactability</p>
<p>First consider the typical conditions that you expect to encounter. Sleeping bags can generally be grouped into four comfort-rating categories:</p>
<p>•     Summer weight (above freezing)</p>
<p>•     3-season (as low as 15ºF)</p>
<p>•     4-season (5ºF to 0ºF)</p>
<p>•     Winter/extreme (as low as –40ºF)</p>
<p>Comfort ratings are based on the insulation’s thickness, or loft (more loft = more heat retention). Use these ratings as a guideline because there are several real-life factors that will affect the bag’s performance. Your metabolism, diet, and fluid intake directly affect how warmly you sleep. Ground insulation, shelter, and the shape of the bag will also contribute dramatically to your overall comfort.</p>
<p>When fully lofted, the fill in a sleeping bag creates thousands of very small dead-air pockets. These pockets trap warmth generated by your body, slowing transfer to the hostile environment beyond the sleeping bag.</p>
<p>Waterfowl down and synthetic fiber are the materials of choice because they are durable, do not conduct heat very well, and have the capability to loft time after time.</p>
<p>Down, as any waterfowl will tell you, is an excellent insulator. Nothing beats the warmth-to-weight ratio, compressibility, or luxurious feel of a good down bag. These characteristics make it an ideal choice for those who travel light or want to minimize pack space. The quality of down is measured by its fill power; e.g., one ounce of 550 fill has the volume of 550 cubic inches when fully lofted, 500 to 550 is good. A 600 to 700 fill is excellent, but expensive. But, with the proper care, a down bag will last much longer than a synthetic fill bag, making it a good long-term investment. The major drawback with down is that it loses most of its insulating value when wet, and air-drying takes a very long time. Down may also be a problem for some allergy sufferers.</p>
<p>Synthetic fills are composed of small-diameter polymer fibers. Sheets, or batts, of these fibers provide the insulation used in many sleeping bags now available. Quality bags will contain respected brand name fills such as Hollofil II, Polarguard HV, or Lite Loft.</p>
<p>Hollofil II is a soft, relatively compressible fill composed of short, hollow fibers. Polarguard HV (High Void) is made up of continuous, cross-linked, hollow-core polyester fibers. This ensures that the insulation stays where it is supposed to, making Polarguard HV the most durable synthetic fill. 3M’s new Lite Loft, composed of extremely fine, cross-linked fibers, approaches the warmth-to-weight ratio of down. Lite Loft has proven to be durable, compressible, and comfortable.</p>
<p>Although not as compressible or as light, a synthetic bag is less expensive than an equivalent down bag. Also, synthetics do not absorb water. This means that, unlike wet down, a synthetic fill will maintain some of its lofting power and warmth when wet. Synthetics will also dry on their own faster than down, making them less vulnerable to mildew and other moisture damage.</p>
<p>Building a better bag—The outer shell must serve three critical functions:</p>
<p>•     Hold the insulation in place</p>
<p>•     Create an effective wind block</p>
<p>•     Allow internal moisture (perspiration) to escape</p>
<p>Ripstop or taffeta nylon are often used because of their lightness and tight weave. A tight weave will keep the fill, especially down, in place and minimize wind penetration. Gore-Tex is used on some high-end down bags. Although it adds a bit of weight over regular nylon, Gore-Tex provides a great deal of moisture protection and wind resistance, making for a warmer bag.</p>
<p>For comfort and efficiency, the inner lining must be soft, breathable, and be able to wick moisture away from your body. Nylon meets these needs, but a nylon/ poly/cotton blend will feel better against the skin.</p>
<p>To prevent the outer shell and inner lining of a synthetic bag from touching a potential cold spot, sheets or batts of fill should be overlapped so that each stitch line is backed up by one or more layers of insulation.</p>
<p>Because down is a loose fill, compartments are needed to keep it in place. Baffles, made of mesh fabric, are sewn from the shell to the lining to create channels that are then filled with down. Using baffles also prevents the shell and lining from touching, eliminating cold spots. Some lightweight bags are sewn through (the fill is stabilized by stitching shell and liner together). These bags are recommended for warm weather use only because each stitch line creates a cold spot.</p>
<p>There are four basic bag shapes: mummy, modified mummy, barrel, and rectangular, each with its own inherent advantages and disadvantages. With less space to warm, a close-fitting bag will have a higher thermal efficiency than that of a roomier one, even if they have the same amount of loft. The trade-off is that it may feel too constricting to be comfortable. Check the fit by climbing in and zipping up. Make sure you can move freely without compressing the loft, especially around the shoulders and in the foot box. If you don’t feel comfortable, try another bag. It won’t get better when you set up camp.</p>
<p>Hoods should be contoured with lots of insulation (up to 40 percent of personal heat loss is through the head).</p>
<p>Yokes will keep warm air from being forced out around your neck whenever there is movement in the bag.</p>
<p>Foot boxes should allow room for your feet to rest naturally without compressing insulation. Also look for additional insulation in this area.</p>
<p>Draft tubes should run the entire length of the zipper to prevent cold spots. It is best when they are sewn to the inner lining, not sewn through to the outer shell.</p>
<p>Zippers made of nylon are light, easy running, and conduct heat less than metal. Nylon coil zippers are less likely to snag fabric and are self-repairing if untracked.</p>
<p><em>Accessories</em></p>
<p>Liners made of soft poly/cotton blend can be used to keep the inside of the bag clean. They add some weight, but save your bag from the trauma of overwashing.</p>
<p>Overbags are simple synthetic fill bags that slip over your regular bag to extend the comfort range. Alone, they can sometimes be used as a summer bag.</p>
<p>Sleeping pads provide ground insulation, protection, and added comfort. Consider one of closed-cell foam (won’t absorb moisture) or a Therm-a-Rest (open-cell foam in a waterproof, airtight case). Unprotected open-cell foam acts like a sponge if it gets wet.</p>
<p>Care and cleaning—Store your bag loosely, never compressed in its stuff sack. Air it out, and make sure it’s dry before putting it away in a cool, ventilated area (hung up or in a large storage sack).</p>
<p>Use a down-specific cleaner such as Kenyon or a very mild detergent when washing a bag. Soap leaves a residue, even after repeated rinsing and harsh detergents can deteriorate the fill. For both down and synthetics, hand washing in a large tub of lukewarm water is safest, but a commercial, front-loading washer will also work. Soak the bag, then work the cleaner with a gentle agitating motion. Rinse repeatedly until the water is clear. Then press out (never wring) as much water as possible. Always support a wet bag entirely when picking it up. The weight of soaked fill can destroy internal baffles and stitching. Unlike synthetic fills, down will take a very long time to air-dry completely (three to five days), an invitation to mildew. If possible, use a commercial dryer at a low heat. To break up any clumps and regain the loft of down, put some clean tennis balls in the dryer.</p>
<p><strong><em>Clothing</em></strong></p>
<p>Dressing in layers, instead of one bulky do-everything garment, can help prevent uncomfortable and potentially dangerous situations. Layering is the relatively simple concept of dressing in a way that allows you to adjust to a wide range of environmental conditions.</p>
<p>To understand layering a little bit better, let’s look at some of the mechanisms the body employs to regulate comfort, because after all, comfort is what it’s all about. To provide an optimum working environment, your internal systems try to maintain a thin layer of warm (86 to 91ºF), still air around your body. This is your very own microclimate. If the surrounding environment was constant and your life was void of activity, it’s all you need. But that is not the case. Once you step outdoors, throwing caution (and your body) into the wind, you run the risk of knocking your microclimate out of whack. Physical activity, wind temperature, and moisture can all contribute to creating conditions too extreme for the body’s mechanisms to deal with on their own. Wearing a series of thin layers will allow you to maintain an optimum microclimate during periods of physical exertion, as well as those times you stand around waiting for something to happen. By dressing this way, you can fine-tune your microclimate by shedding layers before you get too hot or by adding layers before you start cooling down.</p>
<p>Inner layer—Referred to by most people as underwear, this layer plays the most critical function of the system. It must transport moisture, usually in the form of sweat, away from the skin and disperse it to the next layer where it can evaporate. This process is often advertised as wicking.</p>
<p>Why is this so important? Water is a very good heat conductor. A wet garment against your skin can draw heat away from your body twenty-five times faster than a dry one. Even in conditions above freezing, this rapid heat loss can cause a dangerous drop in your body’s core temperature, leading to hypothermia. Synthetics such as polypropylene and polyester now dominate as the materials of choice for this layer. Synthetics are light, strong, and best of all, unlike natural fibers, synthetics absorb very little water. This quality makes for quick-dry materials, reducing the risk of conductive heat loss.</p>
<p>Synthetic underwear is available in light, medium, and heavy weights to meet the demands of different activities. Light weight is for sustained activity where moisture transport is paramount. For changing activity levels, midweight allows a balance of wicking and insulation value. Heavy weight is for those times when your activity level is limited to watching the temperature drop. The inner layer should fit snugly, but not so tight as to feel restricting.</p>
<p>Midlayer—The prime directive, so to speak, of the midlayer is to provide insulation and continue the transport of moisture from the inner layer. To slow heat loss, this layer must be capable of retaining warmth that is generated by your body. Wool and synthetics are well suited for this purpose because the structure of the fibers create small airspaces that trap molecules of warm air.</p>
<p>As far as moisture management goes, synthetics have the upper hand because they absorb little water, allowing faster evaporation. Wool absorbs up to 30 percent of its own weight in water, leaving it heavy and difficult to dry. Synthetic fleece/pile garments (jackets, pullovers, and vests), as well as being lightweight, are very durable and require less care than wool. Additional features such as pit zippers and full-length front zippers add to the versatility and control. As with the inner layer, this layer should be snug, but not constricting. If it is too loose, it just means more space your body has to warm up.</p>
<p>Outerlayer—With all the effort you have just put into creating the perfect environment, you don’t want to have it blown away by a gust of wind or soaked by rain. The outer layer protects your microclimate from the elements. It should also allow air to circulate and excess moisture to escape.</p>
<p>Choose on the basis of what you plan to do, where you plan to do it, and what you plan to spend. For dry conditions, a breathable (uncoated) wind shell may be all you need. If you expect conditions to be more severe, a waterproof (coated) rain jacket with additional insulation may be more in line with your needs. A shell made of a breathable/waterproof fabric, such as Gore-Tex, will give you protection from wind and rain, as well as allowing water to escape. Keep in mind, however, there are no miracle fabrics. When you are active, your body can produce more water vapor than any fabric can pass. The result can be a buildup of moisture on the inside, leaving you wet, clammy, and cold. Strip off a layer or open any ventilation zippers before this happens, and you will be a happier camper.</p>
<p>Head protection—It has been estimated that 40 percent of a person’s total heat loss can occur through the head. This is because your body considers the head to be a rather important extremity and therefore pumps a hefty volume of blood to it, keeping it warm and functional.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, contrary to what some people may say, the head does not have much fat. Without this natural insulation, your head acts like a radiator, letting heat escape. This puts a strain on the rest of your system because your body must now use additional energy to rewarm the blood as it recirculates. A good wool or fleece hat will not only slow heat loss through your head, it will also make your hands and feet feel warmer because of the improved circulation. Don’t overlook full-face balaclavas and neck gaiters for those really harsh conditions.</p>
<p>Hands and feet—In its effort to keep your head and torso warm in cold conditions, your body reduces blood flow to the hands and feet. To compound this, these areas do not generate much heat on their own. Some sort of protection is needed.</p>
<p>Mittens are warmer than an equivalent pair of gloves because the whole hand contributes to the warming process. The disadvantage is a sacrifice in dexterity. Gloves are good for activities that require independent finger control, such as tying knots, but each finger must warm up its own little compartment, making them less efficient at keeping your hands warm. A layering system that consists of a thin wool or synthetic glove for moisture transport, an insulating mitten, and a noninsulated shell mitten for outer protection will give you a wide range of temperature control and manual dexterity.</p>
<p>Wool—Wool is still the dominant choice for socks, offering a good balance of moisture management, insulation, and cushioning. The addition of a polypro liner sock will speed up moisture transport from the feet to the outer wool layer. Socks should fit snugly. Too tight and circulation can be restricted. A loose sock can slip or bunch up, creating pressure spots that can lead to blisters.</p>
<p>Gore-Tex—Gore-Tex is actually a membrane that is bonded to other high-performance materials to create a durable, laminated fabric that is waterproof and functionally breathable. The Gore-Tex membrane is made up of material (expanded polytetrafluoroethylene) that has about nine billion microscopic pores per square inch. These pores are 20,000 times smaller than a single droplet of liquid water, but 700 times larger than a molecule of water vapor. This allows water vapor from perspiration to easily pass through the membrane while keeping liquid water from the outside at bay. Integrated into the membrane is an oil-hating substance that prevents contamination from insect repellents, cosmetics, or misguided chunks of that greasy chili you had for lunch.</p>
<p>Gore-Tex is very stable. It can withstand just about any conditions that you could encounter on earth or, in some cases, beyond. It remains functional at extreme temperatures. It is not damaged by saltwater or ultraviolet light. Bleach, detergent, and dry-cleaning chemicals will not harm it, and it is not susceptible to mold or mildew. Just remember that the other fabrics used in the garment may be affected by these agents. The care tag included with the garment will have more information.</p>
<p>The value of keeping your Gore-Tex clean cannot be overstated. Keeping water beading on the surface of the fabric allows the membrane to breathe better and minimizes condensation, resulting in vastly improved comfort. Dirt can dramatically impede performance so it is a good idea to wash your Gore-Tex garment frequently, following care instructions on the sewn-in label.</p>
<p>The material is very durable, so don’t worry about damaging the garment with vigorous treatment. (However, double-check the care tag for special handling if the garment uses silk, wool, or down.) A second rinse cycle may be useful in removing detergent residues. High heat in the dryer, and even a light touch-up with a warm iron, will help restore water repellency. After extended wear, use a commercially available water-repellent spray.</p>
<p>Have spare clothing on hand. This is desirable as under some circumstances, contaminated clothing should be discarded. You really don’t want to cavort around naked during a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>How on earth will we be able to keep our clothing clean without a washer and dryer?</strong></p>
<p>You’ve got three choices: <strong><em>Hand-washing, non-electric mechanical washing, and going dirty!</em></strong> Most clothing items will clean up quite nicely by hand-washing in a dishpan in the bathtub, but there are some tricks to doing this efficiently and easily. First, protect your hands by using a mild detergent such as Woolite or liquid dish detergent—regular laundry detergent is far too harsh for repeated hand use, and you’ll end up with a really bad case of chapped hands if you ignore this warning. Second, you’ll get things cleaner if you forget about doing “﻿a big load﻿” and, instead, wash one or two items at a time. For really dirty spots and stubborn stains, keep a hand brush nearby for scrubbing. Make a pile of all the items you’ve washed, squeeze or blot out as much of the water as you can, then dump your wash water into a bucket for re-use (it’ll help knock the first layers of grime off dirty hands, or serve as a “﻿pre-wash﻿” for really greasy pots and pans). Refill the dishpan with clear water and add a teaspoon of white vinegar for a more complete rinse. Re-rinse in fresh water with vinegar as many times as necessary to get out all traces of detergent—otherwise, skin irritation when you wear the clothes can result. If the faint smell of vinegar is objectionable, do a final rinse with plain water. Squeeze out as much excess water as you can, and hang your clean laundry to drip over the bathtub. If there’s a warmer room where the family is congregating, you can move your laundry to a clothesline in that room as soon as it stops dripping.</p>
<p>If you find the idea of hand-washing impossible, there is a hand-cranked washing machine available for doing small loads. Shaped like a small home cement mixer, the machine holds water, detergent and clothes in a cylindrical tub with a pressurized seal, and agitates the clothes when you turn the side-crank. The manufacturer claims that the sealed lid creates a high-pressure bath that forces soapy water into fabrics, for a fast and easy load (two minutes!).</p>
<p><strong><em>Boots</em></strong></p>
<p>Selection of footwear is as important as selecting the right clothes. Many would argue that it is even more important. Depending on the need, we have hiking boots, mountaineering boots, and snow boots. Boots are further divided into cold-wet and cold-dry types. Given the great variety of boots on the market, we shall limit discussion to a few types.</p>
<p>For all-around hiking insulated, Gore-Tex hiking boots are recommended. Heavy mountaineering boots are not designed for walking, so stay with hiking boots for all-around use. Don’t buy boots that are too tight. Your feet will swell when you are hiking. You buy boots to protect the feet from the roughness of the trail and to keep out water, snow, mud, stones, and other material. Any boot you buy should have a lugged outsole. The better ones are the Indy 500, Positrac, Vibram Foura, and Vibram Hiking. The boots should flex at the balls of the feet and be made of full-grain leather with a Gore-Tex bootie. This is reasonably watertight.</p>
<p>Boots higher than the ankle add weight and tend to form creases that irritate the Achilles tendons. Truly waterproof boots are for specialized use only. The feet sweat and the boot thus becomes wet anyway.</p>
<p>Boot care—Wear new boots around for a couple of weeks, and let them get scuffed up. This helps to remove the factory-applied buffing wax. Then treat the seams and the join of the sole with Freesole or a similar compound. This will greatly increase the water resistance and durability of boots. Allow the treated boots to cure for twenty-four hours by placing them in a box with a wet towel. This treatment should be done before applying other water-repellent compounds.</p>
<p>Treat the fabric and leather with Biwell Green or like compounds. This has a very high silicone content that will provide excellent water resistance. Using a toothbrush, apply a thin coat and allow twenty-four hours for it to penetrate the leather and fabric before using.</p>

<p><strong><em>Tents</em></strong></p>
<p>A tent is one of the more essential and expensive items needed for sleeping outdoors. With a lightweight tent, you can carry a home on your back that can be assembled in minutes. No more lugging around heavy yurts or tepees. Tents are made in a multitude of designs to suit a wide variety of uses: from mountaineering to cycle touring to car camping. But a tent that is perfect for one use is sometimes not the best type for another. Therefore, you will probably want to find a tent, or tents, that work well for different activities. To narrow your choices, consider some basic questions. When and where will it be used? How many people must it hold? Is weight important? How much will it cost?</p>
<p>Three-season, four-season, and expedition tents—The first thing to decide is what time of the year you will be using the tent. Three-season tents can be used in the more moderate weather of spring, summer, and fall, while four-season tents can take you into winter. Four-season expedition tents go past the four-season rating and are designed to stand up to the worst possible conditions.</p>
<p>Tents designed for really bad weather usually feature more and stronger poles, additional waterproofing, and a sturdier design. Be aware that the season designation of a tent is not a perfect classification. A tent that stands up to snow well may not hold up in a really strong wind and vice versa.</p>
<p>Tent shape and design—The majority of tents have a breathable inner canopy and a separate waterproof fly. The two-walled construction is beneficial in two ways. First, it moderates the temperature, thanks to the insulating airspace between the two walls. Second, it allows ventilation of body vapor. Ventilation is important because a person loses about a pint of water during a night’s sleep. If not allowed to escape, this moisture condenses inside the tent and can get you and your gear wet. A tent can also be ventilated by using waterproof and breathable fabric similar to Gore-Tex.</p>
<p>Traditionally, tents were made in an A-frame design that is becoming obsolete due to the evolution of flexible tent poles. Tunnel and geodesic dome tents, which use flexible poles, are now standard. Most tents are hybrids of these designs, and one manufacturer’s version of a dome tent can be quite different than another’s. This makes generalizations about design difficult.</p>
<p>Many tents are freestanding, which means they come to life without being pegged down. This is advantageous because the tent can be assembled anywhere and then plopped down in the best site. A freestanding tent works best when pegged and must be anchored in winds or when left unattended. Don’t let freestanding be too important a criterion as some nonfreestanding tents may only require a few pegs and will be lighter and tighter than a similar freestanding model.</p>
<p>What to look for—Before buying a tent, you should set it up. If the tent is already assembled, ask the salesperson if you can take it down and put it up again. This is the best way to judge how easy it is to pitch. While setting up the tent, imagine you are cold, hungry, and wet. How long does it take? Could you do it wearing gloves? Once you have finished the assembly, take your shoes off, get inside, stretch out, and roll around. Consider how many people will fit inside. Are they midgets or giants? Is there room for gear?</p>
<p>Next, take a look at the inside of the tent. To determine how strong it is, push on the walls from different angles and directions to ensure it won’t collapse or bend too easily. (Freestanding and pegged-out tents will behave differently in this test.) The canopy and fly should be as taut as possible since loose panels will decrease breathability, water repellency, and stability. Check that the poles join easily and snugly with no area of unusual stress. In general, tents with more poles and pole intersections are stronger, but heavier. Steeper walls catch more wind, but shed rain better. A flat roof allows snow buildup.</p>
<p>Tent construction—the body—A tent’s floor should be made from a tough, waterproof material that is also used on the first six inches of the tent walls. The rest of the tent body will be constructed of a nonwaterproof fabric, usually taffeta or ripstop nylon. The weight of the fabric will largely determine how heavy the structure is, but keep in mind that lighter fabrics are usually less durable.</p>
<p>It is important to examine a tent’s seams as they are prone to leaking and take stress when the tent is taut. Two seam types, bound and lap felled, are most common in tents. The weaker of the two, bound seams are constructed by stitching through a layer of material folded over the two pieces being joined. With lap-felled seams, the two pieces of fabric are placed on top of each other, folded, and then stitched. Good quality tents use lap-felled seams wherever possible and bound seams where more than two pieces of fabric need to be joined (although they should not be used indiscriminately).</p>
<p>Poles—Most tent poles are now shock corded, which means the poles are hollow and attached by an elastic cord running down the center and fixed at both ends. This makes the poles easier to assemble. Ideally, a tent pole should be lightweight, strong, and somewhat flexible. The three basic materials used in tent-pole construction are fiberglass, carbon fiber/composite, and aluminum.</p>
<p>Aluminum, the most common material, comes in a variety of qualities made from different alloys. The 7000 series is the strongest followed by the 6000 and 2000 series. Carbon fiber/composite poles are also popular because they are light and strong. But they are expensive. At the other end of the scale are fiberglass poles, which are cheap, heavy, and prone to breaking.</p>
<p>The fly—The fly is the part of the tent most exposed to the elements, and it will need to be replaced more often than the tent body itself. To be effective, a fly must be constructed of a waterproof material. It can be extended away from the tent to create a vestibule, which acts like a porch. Vestibules are useful for storing gear.</p>
<p>Stakes and zippers—Zippers are often the first part of a tent to break. If a slider goes first, it is relatively easy to fix. Whereas an entire zipper is more expensive. When buying a tent, look for any tight or difficult zippers that could break later on. A nylon coil zipper is lighter and less likely to stick than a metal one. Aluminum stakes around nine inches long work well in most environments. Carry them in a separate bag to protect the tent from punctures.</p>
<p>Tent care—Proper care of a tent, both at home and in the field, can lengthen its life. Clean your tent after use as debris can create holes and tears once the tent is packed. When possible, let the tent dry before packing because moisture causes mildew that can stain the fabric and make it smell. Make sure it is completely dry before storing it for any length of time. In addition, seal your tent regularly (if not seam taped) because water tends to leak through the stitch holes. Lastly, if it is set up for long periods, cover your tent with a tarp or keep it in the shade to guard against ultraviolet rays, which are the single greatest cause of tent failure.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sewage:</strong></span></em></p>
<p><strong>What do we do about using the toilet? If the electricity is off, there will be no running water.</strong></p>
<p>If you live in a home that has its own septic system, your toilet will flush normally if you dump a two-gallon bucket of water into the bowl after use. If you’re hooked up to a city sewer system, dumping water into the toilet may or may not work—it depends on whether your city’s system has electric switches and pumps to move the effluent from homes to the treatment plant. Call the manager of the sewer system and ask whether you can flush your toilet with a bucket of water if the entire city were without power. Don’t accept a “﻿probably﻿” or “﻿I don’t think so﻿” answer—if he or she can’t respond with authority, and back it up in writing, ask for the name and number of someone who can, and you might want to get the local newspaper involved too. A lot of people will need to know the answer.</p>
<p>If the answer is “﻿no,﻿” (or you have any doubt!) you’ll need to devise an independent toileting method for your family. Your choices include a composting toilet, a porta potty usually reserved for camping expeditions, or a rented chemical toilet-in-a-box (such as what you see at construction sites). It’s not a good idea to “﻿just go outside,﻿” even if you live in a rural area, because over an extended period of time the human body can produce an overwhelming amount of liquid and solid waste which can foul an area and create additional health problems.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Medical:</span></em></strong></p>
<p>A few words about surviving without doctors. Most physicians, hospitals, and medical supplies are located in cities. Most disaster scenarios will hit cities harder than the countryside. Therefore, you may have to do without conventional medical treatment after a disaster. The human body has remarkable capabilities of healing itself, especially if the injured and their companions practice intelligent benign neglect.</p>
<p>While on the subject of medical matters, do not forget about veterinary antibiotics. People who for decades have used antibiotics to combat their infections have not produced normal quantities of antibodies and have subnormal resistance to many infections. People who have not been dependent on antibiotics have these antibodies. In the aftermath of a disaster, most survivors would be in rural areas. Many would need antibiotics. Much of their need could be met by supplies of veterinary antibiotics kept on livestock and chicken farms, at feed mills, and in small towns.  Many animals are given more antibiotics in their short lives than most Americans receive in theirs. In many farming areas, veterinary antibiotics and other medicines are in larger supply than are those for people. Realistic preparations to survive should include using these supplies.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">MEDICAL ISSUES: From Dr. “X” Y2K Medical Guide</span></strong></p>
<p>In the event of a national economic breakdown, our “industrialized” food production and distribution system could break down, resulting in shortages or unavailability in many parts of the country.  This possibility must be factored in to your medical and nutritional preparations.</p>
<h4>Nutritional Diseases</h4>
<p>Protein-Energy malnutrition affects children most severely</p>
<p>Vitamin A deficiency</p>
<p>Vitamin C deficiency &#8211; “scurvy”</p>
<p>Vitamin B deficiencies &#8211; beriberi (thiamin), pellagra</p>
<p>(niacin or lack of absorption of niacin in corn sources)</p>
<p>Iodine &#8211; some cases suspected</p>
<p>Iron &#8211; especially in pregnant and lactating women</p>
<p><strong>RECOMMENDATION:</strong>  Plan on making a supply of multi-vitamins, and extra “C” vitamins, a part of your supply preparation.  They are small, generally inexpensive, and can make a big difference in your overall health in long term situations.</p>
<h4>Communicable  Diseases</h4>
<p>Measles</p>
<p>Diarrhea Diseases</p>
<p>Cholera</p>
<p>Acute Respiratory Infections</p>
<p>Malaria</p>
<p>Hepatitis</p>
<p>Meningitis</p>
<p>From the medical/ethical perspective, while the drugs used down at the Animal Hospital are the same as far as potency and cleanliness, the dosage given to animals varies widely.</p>
<p>Medicines packaged for larger animals like cattle for instance may have to be greatly diluted for humans. Dosages for your 30 lb. Cocker Spaniel will probably have to be increased for human use.</p>
<p>If you’re in a city somewhere, you need to take a trip to the country as soon as possible to a farm supply store. One chain is Quality Farm &amp; Fleet, another is Southern States, but whatever the name, these stores dot the countryside like “Wal-Marts for farmers.” They’re veritable department stores except their hardware departments cater to farmers’ special needs.</p>
<p>One of those needs farmers have is for veterinary products that they administer themselves.</p>
<p>While some drugs given to animals require a prescription from a vet, like the antibiotic <em>amoxicillin, </em>the anesthetic <em>lidocaine, </em>and the steroid <em>prednisone, </em>there are many products useful for humans that can be bought without question at one of these stores.</p>
<p>One afternoon’s shopping in person and in the catalog produced this selection of medicines and medical supplies. Also listed is their common uses in humans:</p>
<p>Albendazole:                  anti parasitic.</p>
<p>Aureomycin chlortetracycline: Wounds. Part of the tetracycline family. See below.</p>
<p>Betadine Ointment: Topical antibiotic.</p>
<p>Blood Stopper: stops bleeding from wounds, which do not require a tourniquet.</p>
<p>“Blue Compound”: wound healing lotion and antiseptic.</p>
<p>Electrolyte Powder: Combat dehydration.</p>
<p>Epinephrine: Anaphylactic shock (respiratory collapse) due to allergic reaction for   </p>
<p>                       example, bronchodialiator for asthmatics.</p>
<p>Gelatin capsules for repackaging powdered medicine into capsule form.</p>
<p>Gentamicin: antibiotic when penicillins or the less toxic drugs are contraindicated.</p>
<p>Ivermectin: Anti parasitic preparation.</p>
<p>Kaolin-Pectin: Anti-diarrhea. Not always recommended and this product <em>does not  </em></p>
<p><em>                        address dehydration danger. </em>It was readily available however for    </p>
<p>                         the purposes of this list and has application in humans.</p>
<p>Neomycin: Mainly used topically in humans though some internal uses prior to  </p>
<p>                    abdominal surgery.</p>
<p>Oxytetracycline: Another member of the tetracycline family.</p>
<p>Penicillin G Procaine: Antibiotic against a range of strep and staph infections and      </p>
<p>                                     certain sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>Permethrin: Scabies, Delousing.</p>
<p>Piperazine: Dewormer and anti-parasitic.</p>
<p>Reusable Syringes &amp; Needles: Administer medication by injection.</p>
<p>Scalpels and Suture material.</p>
<p>Sulfamethazine: a “sulfa” drug used to fight infections but less powerful than      </p>
<p>                           “antibiotics” and must be taken with large amounts of water to   </p>
<p>                            avoid kidney damage.</p>
<p>Tetanus Antitoxin: Prevent lockjaw.., immunize burn and wound patients.</p>
<p>Tetracycline: Treatment of mycoplasma, chlamydia, rickettsia, clostridium, sexually transmitted diseases. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dangerous to use after expiration date  </span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">on bottle unlike many other drugs which simply weaken in strength.</span></strong></p>
<p>Tylan:                 antibiotic</p>
<p>Udder Balm: Soothing topical skin ointment.</p>
<p>An amazing variety of products, wouldn’t you say? Did you know they were sitting right under your nose and available without prescription? Naturally if you’re using something designed for animals on humans, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it should be in a dire emergency when “for human” equivalents are unavailable and under suitable medical care only</span>!</p>
<p><strong>How to use them</strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Remember:          The use of veterinary medications by humans is definitely ILLEGAL in the U.S. The following is for INFORMATION purposes only. Use it at your own risk.</span></em></strong></p>
<p>What I didn’t mention above is that this shopping trip also produced lots of confusion. There were medications that simply couldn’t be used. How do you know the difference? Simple.</p>
<p>You check the chemical name against a reference book like the Physicians Desk Reference or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Davis’ Drug Guide For Nurses</span> or other similar medical references to see <em>if there is a human application and at what dosage! </em>Besides Davis, I especially recommend the Hesperian Foundation’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where There Is No Doctor</span>, an excellent “do it yourself” text.</p>
<p>The latter is the smaller book and therefore easier to use quickly. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Physician’s Desk Reference</span> or “PDR” for short is much more comprehensive however.</p>
<p>Of course, you don’t want to take either into the farm store and advertise your use of these products! Write down what’s available and check it out later!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Because all the above </span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">drugs <strong>can have very dangerous side effects when abused, you must use </strong>them <strong>with as much access to medical knowledge as possible~ preferably  a  physician</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communications:</span></em></strong></p>
<p>In a crisis, not having accurate information can be psychologically unsettling at best, and life-threatening at worst. Nothing can create a sense of isolation and fear more quickly than being cut off from the flow of information. This is particularly true in our overcommunicated society, where we are almost addicted to twenty-four–hour news updates and immediate Internet access to the latest breaking information.</p>
<p>Whether it’s a natural disaster such as a tornado, a hurricane, or a flood, or a social problem that keeps us from our regular means of getting news, the communication channels we depend on most are at risk. This includes television and radio broadcasts, Internet access, and even basic phone service. Therefore, it is imperative for your psychological well-being, as well as your physical safety, to have some sort of alternative communications system in place.</p>
<p>There are several good AM/FM radios on the market that work with alternative power. Certainly any battery-operated radio is an option. Just make sure you also stockpile a good supply of batteries. However, there are a couple of radios that can run without electricity or batteries. Since they are relatively inexpensive, I would suggest that you acquire one.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Simple radio receivers or scanners are great when all you want to do is listen in on a broadcast or someone else’s two-way transmissions. But what if you want to engage in two-way communication yourself? What if you want to talk as well as listen?</span></p>
<p>One option is a CB (“﻿citizen’s band﻿”) radio. As you may recall, these were very popular in the 1970s, before the availability of cellular phones, but are now making a comeback. You can pick them up very inexpensively—usually less than $100, and even cheaper if you are willing to do a little garage sale shopping. They supposedly have a range of ten to twenty miles if the channel is clear and the terrain permits; or about four to five miles if the channel is congested. In actual use the range is usually about a mile and a half. However, if you wire them to an antenna and elevate them on a PVC pipe or other device, you can extend the range by several miles. (You will need to do some experimenting to find out if this will work in your situation.)</p>
<p><sup> </sup></p>
<p>Before you rush out and purchase a bunch of fancy communications equipment, you need to determine your communications needs and decide what you want to accomplish. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. <strong><em>Make a list of the people you want to stay in touch with in an emergency</em></strong>. This will undoubtedly include family members, business associates, church friends, and neighbors.</p>
<p>2. <strong><em>Determine what it would take to stay in touch with each person</em></strong>. For example, to stay in touch with my parents, who live in another part of the country, will require an amateur radio. To communicate with my fellow church members, who are scattered over a wide geographic area, may require the same. But I can use either CB or FRS radio to talk to the neighbors in my subdivision.</p>
<p>3. <strong><em>Consider your resources</em></strong>. Make sure that you attend to first things first. As important as staying in touch may be, it’s not as important as food, water, and shelter. Make sure you take care of those things first, <em>before</em> you blow a bunch of money on high-tech communication gadgets. If you have less than $100 to spend, get a simple AM/FM radio that will run on solar power or via a hand-crank mechanism. If you have a couple of hundred dollars, you can add a CB or FRS radio.</p>
<p>4. <strong><em>Get a commitment from the people you want to talk to</em></strong>. It won’t do you any good to buy a radio if the people you want to talk to don’t have one. Duh! That’s why buying a radio is often a group decision. It’s best if you are using similar equipment so you can help one another with problems.</p>
<p>5. <strong><em>Develop a communications plan</em></strong>. How often to you want to talk to the people in your network? What are your procedures and protocols? These are things you need to figure out <em>together</em>,<em> </em>long before you are in the middle of a crisis.</p>
<p>6. <strong><em>Run periodic test drills</em></strong>. Take a page from the military: practice, practice, practice. You want a system you can depend on in an emergency. The only way to do this is by getting comfortable with it before you need it.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Guidelines On Preparation:</span></em></strong></p>
<p>Remember that accumulating supplies is easy only before day that you become a “target”. After that, it is a chancy and more expensive proposition. Many people will be after the same materials once the situation becomes sticky. So stock up early (as much as possible). And keep quiet about what you buy. Cache some of your supplies using lengths of plastic sewer and water pipes. The ends can be easily sealed with end caps available from the same source as the pipes. Governments have a nasty habit of confiscating supplies from people who prepared for disasters to give to the indigent. Their logic runs to the philosophy that by giving supplies away, you reduce the possibility of the indigents turning into predators. All they are doing is putting everyone at risk.</p>
<p>It is important to have a designated place for your group to meet should you have to evacuate. You must have a place picked out well before the excrement hits the fan. It should be easy to identify and to reach by all members of your group. And it should not be on the official evacuation route.</p>
<p>When gathering for meetings, never assume that you can use the same place twice, and vary the times often.  Develop ways of informing the group without “broadcasting” it to all and sundry.  Be prepared to share supplies with your brothers and sisters in need.  And lastly, remember that God is in control of all things at all times; have faith!</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Coping with an Oppressive Government</span></em></strong></p>
<p>In order to combat terrorism and crime, many federal and state governments are advocating the use of identity cards, compulsory address-change registration, firearms registration, and confiscation of certain classes of firearms. Increasingly, governments are using oppressive techniques on the general population in order to catch a few terrorists or criminals. This starts a futile process. More and more controls will be needed to know who is doing what. This intrusion into the family home is alien to the North American psyche.<strong></strong></p>
<p>You would be shocked to know how little privacy you have left. Introduction of new technology reduces it even more. Imagine a “smart card” that would not let you make a grocery purchase if you are more than two miles from your home. The technology is here today to enable the government to do just that. If you looked into your file at the FBI, the state police, the motor vehicles office, or your credit bureau, you might feel like a rape victim.  This information, coupled with the government’s desire to be Big Brother, is the biggest current threat facing us.</p>
<p>If you don’t believe that oppressive government can be harmful to your health, consider that in this century alone close to 200 million men, women, and children have been shot, beaten, knifed, clubbed, tortured, burned, frozen, crushed, worked to death, buried alive, blown up, drowned, bombed, or killed in other ways by their own governments. A bad government can be as deadly as the Black Plague.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day One</em></strong></p>
<p>When address change registration is compulsory and identity cards are issued, Day One has either arrived or is very close. This may start out benignly. Americans will be required to register at the post offices. This will apply to all residents and visitors to the U.S.  Once you are registered, the government may want to keep an eye on you. This may be in the form of a local registration card or some type of federal identification.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em><strong>What to do:</strong></em></p>
<p>•           You should begin to cache basic supplies in several places. A cache is different from     </p>
<p>            hiding in that the cache is for long-term storage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Day Two</em></strong></p>
<p>Day Two will feature a need for permits to visit border areas and a security check on those living in the border regions. Based on the communist doctrine, the border region is usually a ten-mile (sixteen-kilometer) strip. Comprehensive registration of all persons is an initial step for a potentially oppressive government to take; first they must know who is living in their jurisdiction.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>The government will set up committees in schools, workplaces, and apartment buildings to “guide” citizens. There will be snitch lines to turn in those who are opposed to the government. These snitch lines will be irritating in the beginning, but later on they may be a ticket to labor camps.</p>
<p><strong><em>Day Three</em></strong></p>
<p>By now the government feels that it has partial control over its citizens. The newly issued identity cards will be required for all transactions. Data banks are linked so that if you skip a day from work on the pretext of sickness and buy a ticket to a ballgame with your credit card, you may be in deep doo-doo. There will be a government seizure of all airports and aircraft, and a federal transportation agency will control all manners of transportation.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>Using computer terminals in police cars, the authorities will carry out large-scale razzias (Webster’s: A plundering and destructive incursion). These start with large police units cordoning off urban blocks. Once cordoned off, everyone within it must show the new identity documents. The police will check through computer terminals whether these are valid. Those with false documents will be detained. A complete search of all buildings will be carried out. These police units will have metal detectors and other equipment. Anyone with prohibited items will be detained.</p>
<p>Students in schools will have to report on activities at home. It is likely that special “counselors” will be added to the schools’ staffs.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>What to do:</em></p>
<p>•           Start bartering for those items that the government controls.</p>
<p>•           Arrange all traceable transactions on the basis that you buy a little extra each time you   </p>
<p>            shop. This will not alert the controllers. They may think that you are overeating. You are   </p>
<p>            establishing a pattern of purchasing a little extra.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Four</em></strong></p>
<p>The government, in the name of crime control, will institute computer indexes of potential criminal behavior. God save you if you are eccentric. You may answer your phone and hear a computer-synthesized voice say, “Citizen Smith, you are in violation of the ‘loud music after 11 p.m.’ regulation, and your toilet flushed four times in the last hour. Stop the criminal activity.” <strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>What to do:</em></p>
<p>•<em>           </em>It is prudent to find out what constitutes “criminal behavior.” See if you can use your   </p>
<p>            contacts to find out the criteria for index points, such as antisocial attitude, conviction for  </p>
<p>            loitering, and so on. Once you accumulate enough points, they may send you to a  </p>
<p>            “reeducation camp.”<em></em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Five</em></strong></p>
<p>To maintain control will require even more controls. You will see your remaining freedoms sucked into a black hole called “safety of the citizen.” The government’s desire to maintain control will extend to some very trivial areas. If not having a dog tag becomes a major offense, watch out. The government will force relocation of people from hard-to-control areas to “safe” areas. These new locations will have federal housing and control over the people.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>What to do:</em></p>
<p>•<em>           </em>Try to determine who the neighborhood informers are. If you see someone arrested and   </p>
<p>            he comes back a few days later saying that the authorities made a mistake, be careful. He  </p>
<p>            may have been turned and now is an informer.<em></em></p>
<p>•           Find out where the microwave-relay towers are located. A well-placed bullet in the horn   </p>
<p>            can disrupt communications.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Six</em></strong></p>
<p>The government will add more and more control regulations on top of those already enacted. These will be in the form of seizure of all privately held communications devices, excessive food supplies, and private transport vehicles, as well as complete confiscation of firearms, crossbows, longbows, swords, and bayonets. <strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>What to do:</em></p>
<p>•<em>           </em>You should have several caches of your supplies, so if one is found, you have not lost all   </p>
<p>            your goods.<em></em></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Seven</em></strong></p>
<p>To build the new “safe” housing complexes, the government will establish labor camps, and anyone found subversive, unemployed, or on welfare will be sent to one. Children in these camps will be indoctrinated by their teachers and will serve as a fertile recruiting ground for future government forces. If the situation reaches this point, the government is more than likely to reach back into history to establish a new feudal society.</p>
<p><em>What to do:</em></p>
<p>•<em>           </em>Do not move to any of the so-called “safe areas.” Resist by bugging out early.<em></em></p>
<p>•           Arrange a meeting place with family members and friends should you have to bug out   </p>
<p>            individually.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Eight</em></strong></p>
<p>Around this time the system will start to break down. The trivial nature of many control measures will make most people “criminals.” The American psyche does not take kindly to minute control of activities. The security forces, recently enlarged, will be staffed more and more by incompetents. This is a blessing in disguise. How could you resist a really efficient oppressive government?<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<h4><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Minority Group Survival</span></em></h4>
<p>There is a tendency in the human psyche to blame others when tough times arrive. The Germans blamed the Jews for their recession. Quebec’s former premier blamed the ethnic and moneyed groups (moneyed= Jewish) for their loss in the Quebec referendum of 1995. These are just two examples. Being a visible minority can be hazardous to your health in most scenarios. At best you may end up as a slave in some enclave not yet blessed by the ownership of a tractor; at worst you can be very, very dead.</p>
<p><strong><em>Day One</em></strong></p>
<p>When your read that a certain group is singled out for some national ill, take heed. That is usually the first step in stirring up hatred against a minority.</p>
<p><strong><em>Day Two</em></strong></p>
<p>Around this time, thugs will attack business premises and homes owned by the minority group. The more prominent you are, the more likely that some unpleasant incident will happen to you or your family.  The government will call for cooling of the tempers while it is evaluating whether to sacrifice the minority as a scapegoat for the national ills.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Three</em></strong></p>
<p>There will be raids on minority areas. In the beginning, these will be unorganized, but as time goes by, you will see an organized pattern emerging. The minority group under attack will arm itself. The government will send in federal police forces to protect the minority under attack. Depending on how widespread the national ill for which the minority is blamed is, these police forces may or may not be effective. <strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Four</em></strong></p>
<p>Large-scale conflicts will emerge, followed by mass migration of the minority under attack. Depending on the central government’s attitude toward the minority, we will see a genocide or a controlled situation. If the minority has a home area, it will be swollen with refugees and turned into an armed camp.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>The disruption caused by the conflict will result in rising prices and shortages of supplies. People will demand that the government do something about them. The government may blame one minority or the other for the troubles. This will polarize public opinion against the targeted minority.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Five</em></strong></p>
<p>The government will step in to protect the minority under attack, first with increased police presence in the area where the minority group lives and works. If this does not control the violence, a curfew will be put into effect, and troops will be brought into the contested area.<strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>If the minority has an identifiable group preying on it, it will retaliate. An ever-increasing cycle of violence may develop at this time.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><strong><em>Day Six</em></strong></p>
<p>The central government may take one or more of several possible steps. These can range from establishing protected reservations for the minority under attack to indifference to their plight. Whatever action is taken, the minority will realize that they are on their own. <strong><em></em></strong></p>
<p>The following is a good article on a controversial topic.  Once again, I must stress that you must determine how God wants YOU to handle this issue with much prayer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>The Christian And Self Defense: from “S</em>piritual survival during the Y2K crisis”</span></strong></p>
<p>The issue of self-defense must be addressed before a situation ever presents itself. If someone broke into your home, what would you do to protect your family?</p>
<p>A man is going to have to decide in advance how he will protect his wife and children if they are threatened. No pun intended, but the gun issue is a loaded issue. So loaded that it is one you must address. And you must address it ahead of time.</p>
<p>There is a constitutional right to bear arms in this nation. And if a husband and a wife are deeply concerned about the protection of their family, then they can take certain steps.</p>
<p>Several years ago as I was watching CNN, I caught some testimony before Congress on gun control. I heard one woman tell a chilling story. She was putting her two small children down for an afternoon nap when she heard glass breaking downstairs. And then she heard voices. Two men had broken the glass in the door, reached in, and unlocked the door. She was at home with her two children by herself, and two men with wrong motives were inside her house.</p>
<p>The congressman asked her what she did.</p>
<p>“﻿At first I felt a wave of panic. But then I reminded myself that my husband and I had talked about this possibility. And now it was here. I fought off my panic. And then I followed the plan that we had discussed. I walked into our bedroom, took down the key from the nail (placed high enough so our toddlers couldn’t reach it), and unlocked the gun case. I pulled out the Winchester Defender Shotgun. I chambered several rounds. And then I walked out of our bedroom to the top of the stairs. I stayed back away from where I could be seen from the floor below. Without saying a word, I simply worked the action on my pump shotgun.﻿”</p>
<p>The congressman then asked her, “﻿What happened next?﻿”</p>
<p>She replied, “﻿The next thing I immediately heard was the two men running to get out of the house.﻿”</p>
<p>Note some things here. First, the couple had the foresight to think in advance about the safety of the family. Second, they instituted a very clear plan. Third, they kept the shotgun locked away where their small children could not get to it. Fourth, the wife did not have to fire a shot. Fifth, she had a very smart husband.</p>
<p>Why do I say that she had a very smart husband? Her husband knew human nature. Have you ever heard the sound of someone cocking the pump of a shotgun? It is a very definitive sound. It is a sound that says, “﻿I have just chambered a round.﻿” It is a sound that indicates you mean business. It is a sound that every criminal in America understands could cut him in half from less than thirty yards. In short, it is a sound that turns the odds in your favor.</p>
<p>Notice that this woman never said a word. Notice that she never fired a shot. She simply cocked the weapon. And the fact that she had the weapon made the men flee.</p>
<p>We have seen the same scenario played out on television newscasts over the years. For whatever reason, rioting breaks out. Anarchy and chaos are loose in the streets. And when that happens, people begin to loot stores.</p>
<p>But it seems that every time it happens, a shopkeeper makes a stand. He grabs his rifle or shotgun, grabs a chair, and takes a seat in front of his store. And what happens next? Nothing. The passing looters see the guy out in front of his store, and they keep right on going. Like the woman at home with her children, the shopkeeper doesn’t have to fire a shot. When a potential enemy sees the gun, he keeps moving.</p>
<p>I have a friend who came to Christ through the influence of a group of Mennonite and Amish people. As you know, Mennonites and Amish are pacifists. My friend told me that their teaching about pacifism had a great influence on his life as a young believer. He has struggled over whether or not he could actually fire a gun at another person. But he is also concerned about the safety of his family. The last time I talked with him, he told me he was going to buy a pump shotgun. He wasn’t going to buy any ammunition, just the shotgun. He wasn’t sure he could bring himself to actually fire the gun. But he figured he wouldn’t need to. Just the sound of the shotgun being cocked should do the job. And in ninety-nine out of one hundred cases, he’s right.</p>
<p>Are you a single mom? If you’re concerned about safety, you might look into this. Ask one of the men you know to take you to a sporting goods store and get you started. You can enroll in a gun safety course and learn everything that you need to know. You may not have a husband in the house, but you can have a quiet and supportive friend named Winchester.</p>
<p>Nearly every police car in the United States has a shotgun bolted down by the dashboard. A police officer with a shotgun can hold off a threatening mob until help arrives. A Spirit-filled, one-hundred-pound godly woman, holding a shotgun, can do the same thing.</p>
<p>A young seminary student asked me what I would do if someone broke into my home. My response was, “﻿I would do whatever was necessary to protect my family.﻿” Some things are so fundamental to life that they are givens. And protecting your family is one of them. Back when common sense was alive and well in America, this was understood. If someone broke into your home, you were within your rights to defend your family. Unfortunately some states have changed their laws to protect the rights of the ones breaking in. It would be wise to know exactly what the law says in your state. But the bottom line is this: do everything that you can to protect the ones you love the most. Your wife and children should know that you would give up your life, if necessary, to save their lives.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Is Biblical</p>
<p>Is it wrong to take up arms to protect and defend your family or your country? If you read ﻿Luke 22:35–38﻿ about Jesus’ sending His disciples out on their last road trip, He told them to take a money purse, a bag, and a sword. And if they didn’t have a sword, He told them to sell their coats to get one. Now this road trip was different from the last road trips they had taken. This time, Jesus’ name was on the Top Ten Wanted List. And things were about to get rough. Apparently Jesus did not have a problem with having a weapon of self-defense.</p>
<p>That fits in with ﻿Exodus 22:2﻿ (nkjv): “﻿If the thief is found breaking in, and he is struck so that he dies, there shall be no guilt for his bloodshed.﻿”</p>
<p>Nehemiah was directed by God to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. The specific purpose for rebuilding the walls was to provide physical protection for the city’s inhabitants. When Nehemiah’s enemies threatened the lives of the men and the women who were doing the work, Nehemiah instructed them to strap on their swords (﻿Neh. 4:6–18﻿). His instruction to the people was to defend themselves and their families: “﻿Remember the Lord, great and awesome, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your houses﻿” (﻿Neh. 4:14﻿ nkjv).</p>
<p>Norman Geisler states the biblical position well:</p>
<p>“It is evil not to resist evil; it is morally wrong not to defend the innocent … to permit a murder when one could have prevented it is morally wrong. To allow a rape when one could have hindered it is an evil. To watch an act of cruelty toward children without trying to intervene is morally inexcusable. In brief, not resisting evil is a sin of omission, and some sins of omission can be just as evil as sins of commission. In biblical language, “﻿Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins﻿” (﻿James 4:17﻿). Any man who does not protect his wife and children against a violent intruder fails them morally.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lesson 1:  Introduction and Chapter 1<br />
</strong>Thanks largely to the famous spirituals “Ezekiel Saw the Wheel” and “Dry Bones,” Ezekiel is known as a biblical character by millions of people. Unfortunately, the level of Bible knowledge of his difficult book often doesn’t go too much deeper.  <span id="more-1205"></span>The most unusual thing about Ezekiel (unlike Jeremiah, and to a lesser extent Isaiah and most of the Minor Prophets) is his emphasis, not on judgment, but on comforting God’s people. From the Chebar Canal, which was a sort of concentration camp or refugee camp near Babylon, Ezekiel wrote his prophecies to encourage the Jewish exiles.  This is in the southeastern section of modern Iraq, northwest of the Persian Gulf. The Babylonians settled the Jewish exiles in this region to colonize them. Ezekiel’s ministry was primarily to those Jews deported from Judah by the Babylonians and any Israelites that remained in exile from previous deportations by the Assyrians.</p>
<p>Ezekiel (meaning God strengthens or strengthened by God) was one of those who was taken to Babylonia with the second group of captives, eleven years before Jerusalem was destroyed.  Ezekiel dated his prophecies precisely. His first prophecy (1:2) came in the fifth year of Jehoiachin’s exile (593 B.C.); his last dated prophecy was in 571 B.C. (29:17). Hence his ministry lasted at least twenty-two years. If, as a priest, he started his ministry at the age of thirty, he would have been over fifty when he finished his prophesying.  Ezekiel ministered to his fellow-exiles immediately before and during the first twenty-some years of the captivity. They falsely expected to return to Jerusalem, so he taught them that they must first return to the Lord.</p>
<p>Ezekiel’s prophecy is divided into three parts. First, he rehearses the sins of Judah and warns of God’s impending judgment in the captivity of the people and the destruction of the capital. This is all vividly announced in unusual visions and symbolic acts. A bright, shining cloud, a figure of God’s presence, is seen lingering over the temple, then reluctantly departing. This meant that God could no longer dwell among His people because of their sin, and His sword of judgment must soon descend on the polluted temple. The glory of the Lord is one of the key thoughts running throughout the Book of Ezekiel.</p>
<p>In the second section, Judah’s neighbors are condemned because of their idolatry and their cruel treatment of God’s people. These are the Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Philistines, Tyrians, Sidonians, and Egyptians.</p>
<p>Finally, in the last section, Ezekiel tells of the restoration and reunion of the entire nation—both Israel and Judah. When the people repent of their sins, God will put His Holy Spirit within them. The Messiah will come to His people and destroy their last enemies. The temple will be rebuilt, and the glory of the Lord will return to it. These prophecies have not yet been fulfilled, but look forward to Christ’s one- thousand-year reign on earth, the Millennium.</p>
<p><strong>CALL AND COMMISSION OF EZEKIEL (1:1–3:21)<br />
Ezekiel’s Circumstances (1:1–3)<br />
</strong>As the book opens, Ezekiel was a prophet of a priestly family, which was carried captive to Babylon in 597 B.C., who prophesied intermittently until 571 B.C. He was about 25 years old when he was taken to Babylon.  He prophesied about the destruction of Jerusalem six or seven years before it happened. Ezekiel was thirty years of age at this time (“in the thirtieth year”). The first twenty-four chapters were written before the fall of Jerusalem, but after the first deportations.</p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel’s Vision of God’s Glory Riding on a Throne-Chariot (1:4–28a)</strong><br />
The first chapter is taken up with a vision of the glory of God among the captives. Ezekiel first saw a fierce whirlwind coming from the north. Then he saw four living creatures, each of which had four faces (lion, ox, eagle, man), four wings, straight feet, and hands under its wings. The creatures symbolize those attributes of God which are seen in creation: His majesty, power, swiftness, and wisdom.  Cherubim are the created beings assigned to guard the throne of God (Ps. 99:1) as well as the ark of the covenant and the mercy seat (Ex. 25:18–22; 37:7–9). Cherubim (plural for cherub) guarded the Tree of Life to keep man from eating of it and, therefore, living forever in his sins. Thus more than one angel guarded the entrance to Eden. The fullest description of cherubim is in Ezekiel 10, where they are closely related to the glory of God and have a part in its presence and its withdrawal, moving at the Almighty’s direction.</p>
<p> Many nations forget about the God above the cloud, who sits on the throne. They worship earthly creatures or kings, forgetting that God is above all.  Above the firmament was a throne, with the LORD of glory seated upon it.  Ezekiel saw the throne of God and his vision has much in common with John’s vision of the throne in the Book of Revelation. They both describe the throne as being like precious stones, and they both say that there was a rainbow around the throne. The combination of similarities leads to the obvious conclusion that both Ezekiel and John saw the throne of God as it truly exists in the spirit, and they beheld the glory of God. Beside each of the living creatures there was a wheel, or rather a wheel within a wheel (perhaps one wheel at right angle to the other like a gyroscope). Thus the vision seems to represent a throne-chariot, with wheels &#8230; on the earth, four living creatures supporting a platform, and the throne of God above it. It was this vision of the glory of God that preceded Ezekiel’s call to the prophetic ministry.  Notice that the description of the cherubim and their placement echoes that found in Numbers chapter 2, where God designates the placement of the tribes in certain positions which “shadow” the placement of the cherubim around God’s Throne.</p>
<p>According to the Writings of Moses there were about 600,000 men and also women and children who left Egypt at the exodus. They came out of Egypt in rank and in file and as they journeyed in the wilderness the tribes would camp around the Tabernacle in God-specified locations.  The twelve tribes, in groups of three, were divinely situated at a certain distance around the tabernacle. Four of the tribes, Judah, Reuben, Ephraim and Dan were recognized as tribal leaders. Each had its own standard or banner identifying it as a tribal head while the other tribes had ensigns, a lesser type of banner.</p>
<p>Judah occupied the greatest area which was on the eastern side facing the tabernacle entrance behind the tents of Aaron. To their right was the tribe of Issachar and on the other side Zebulun. The tabernacle itself was always found in the very center of the camp with the tents of the various tribes set up at a certain distance. Judah (with Issachar and Zebulun) on the east numbering 186,400 men. Reuben (with Simeon and Gad) in the south numbering 151,450 men. West was Ephraim (with Manasseh and Benjamin) numbering 108,100 men. On the north side was Dan (with Asher and Naphtali) numbering 157,600 men. This brought the total count of men twenty years and upwards to 603,550, not including the tribe of Levi.</p>
<p>Num 2:2  Everyone of the children of Israel shall camp by his own standard, beside the emblems of his father&#8217;s house; they shall camp some distance from the tabernacle of meeting.</p>
<p>Each tribe had a specific banner:  According to Jewish history the banners of the tribes were as follows:<br />
Judah &#8211; East (Lion of gold with a scarlet background).<br />
Ephraim &#8211; West (Ox of black on gold background).    <br />
Reuben &#8211; South (Man on gold background).               <br />
Dan &#8211; North (Eagle of gold on a blue background).    </p>
<p>Notice that this placement is the same as the placement of the cherubim around the throne of God in Ezekiel 1:1-10, and Revelation 4:2-8.  Since the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant was referred to as the “throne of God” because He would speak to Moses from there, it is important that the cherubim, who surround the throne in reality, are symbolized by the banners that surround the “throne” of the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>The second major portion of the vision was the appearance of wheels. There was a wheel in the middle of a wheel (v. 16); the wheels could move in any direction; the wheels touched earth but still reached heaven; and the wheels moved wherever the Spirit led them. The wheels seem to symbolize God’s working on the earth. Nothing stopped them, just as nothing stops the sovereign God who controls all events on earth. This truth would have been very encouraging to the weary exiles to whom Ezekiel was called to minister.</p>
<p>The third part of the vision was the firmament. The Hebrew word used here is the same one used in Genesis 1:6, 7 for the expanse created by God on the second day. Its dazzling brilliance was an appropriate reminder of God’s holiness and transcendent majesty (cf. the description in Rev. 4:6).</p>
<p>Finally, there was a throne and the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it. The important reality was that the throne was occupied, signifying that God was in control and judgment proceeded from His throne. </p>
<p>“This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD.” Ezekiel saw more than Moses saw, more than David, Isaiah, or Daniel saw. He saw a vision of the glory of God. The presence of God was there. When the Lord Jesus came to this earth and took upon Himself our humanity, His glory was not seen. Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord.</p>
<p>“And when I saw it, I fell upon my face.” This vision had a tremendous effect upon Ezekiel, and it should have this effect upon us: “Oh, God, I am undone. I’m lost and I need You. I turn to You and accept You.”  We find throughout the Old Testament that when men came into the presence of God, they went down on their faces. This was true of Isaiah who said: “… Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts” (Isa. 6:5). In the presence of the Lord, this man found himself horizontal with the ground. That was the position Daniel took also. It was the position John took on the isle of Patmos: “And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead …” (Rev. 1:17).</p>
<p>What a picture of our holy God we have here! Someday I am going to look full upon the face of my Savior. I do not know exactly what He looks like, but I am looking forward to that day.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Lesson 2:  Chapters 2-5<br />
Ezekiel’s Appointment to Prophesy to the People of Israel (1:28b–3:21)<br />
</strong>The Character of the People—Rebellious (1:28b–2:7)<br />
The Spirit entered Ezekiel, set him on his feet, and told him to prophesy to a rebellious nation, Judah, regardless of results. He was to be fearless and obedient.</p>
<p>The Lord commissioned Ezekiel, whom He calls “son of man.” This important expression occurs ninety times in Ezekiel.  The first words that God addresses to Ezekiel appropriately put the prophet in his rightful place before the majesty which he has been seeing in his vision. The phrase son of man is a Hebraism which emphasizes Ezekiel’s insignificance or mere humanity. “Son of” indicates “partaking of the nature of” and so when combined with ’adãm, “man,” it means nothing more than “human being.” In the plural it is a common phrase for “mankind”.  By the time of Daniel (7:13, 14) this title had taken on near messianic implications, and in the first century it had become a term for the Messiah: Our Lord’s use of the title seems to have taken advantage of the ambiguity between the simple and the technical meanings, so that in one sense He could not be accused of making any overt claim to Messiahship, while in the other sense He did not  deny those with spiritual insight from accepting the fuller significance of His person.</p>
<p><strong>The Message—Judgment, as Indicated by the Scroll (2:8–3:3)<br />
</strong>Ezekiel was then commanded to eat a scroll on which were written the sorrowful judgments that were to fall on the nation.  He was forewarned that his ministry would not be popular. We too are forewarned that a true presentation of the gospel will be offensive to the unsaved.  Ezekiel ate the scroll, as commanded. A later prophet, “John the Revelator,” would do the same thing (Rev. 10:8–10). Every prophet or preacher needs to internalize the message, making it a part of his own life (cf. 3:10).</p>
<p><strong>The Character of the People—Impudent and Hard-hearted (3:4–11)<br />
</strong>Then God repeated that Ezekiel was being sent to a people who would not listen (Judah is here called Israel). Language barriers can be overcome, as many missionaries tell us. But the barrier of a rebellious heart cannot be overcome. He was to be fearless in speaking to the Jews in the land and to those in captivity.  True servants of Christ must be tough-minded but not hard-hearted.<br />
The Role of the Prophet—Watchman (3:12–21)<br />
The Lord then took Ezekiel to the captives at the River Chebar, and he sat with them in silence for seven days.</p>
<p>Ezekiel was appointed a watchman, responsible to speak God’s Word and to warn the people solemnly. The solemn fact of blood-guiltiness is taught not only in the OT (vv. 18–20) but in the NT as well (Acts 20:26). However high the responsibility of God’s messenger is, Christians should not take this as teaching that they ought to cram the gospel down every throat, or witness in every elevator. Despite his great responsibility, Ezekiel was shut up by God and had to wait for God-given opportunities. We also need to be sensitive to His leading in witnessing. Sometimes we need to be silent. However, most of us are silent when we ought to be witnessing.</p>
<p>Judgment of Judah and Jerusalem Depicted<br />
Visual Aids Illustrating Coming Judgment (3:22–5:17)<br />
Judgment, wrote Peter, must begin at the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). And so God starts with the center of revealed religion, the temple at Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel Commanded to Be Mute until Told by God to Speak (3:22–27)<br />
</strong>First Ezekiel went out into the plain where he beheld the glory of the LORD. Then he was commanded to go to his house where he would be bound and mute until God revealed to him what to say.</p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel Portrays The Siege Of Jerusalem (Chapter 4)<br />
</strong>Chapter 4 predicts the coming siege and famine of Jerusalem. This is graphically done by the prophet, just as the Lord instructed him to do it. Ezekiel took a clay tablet and sketched the city of Jerusalem on it. To picture the siege of an invading force, he built forts around it from which to shoot arrows. Mounds of dirt were moved against the wall, and battering rams were placed in position from which to hurl rocks. An iron pan was set in position as protection against arrows and spears coming from behind the wall, and the army was pitched round about in tents.</p>
<p>Ezekiel lay on his left side behind the iron pan for three hundred ninety days, depicting punishment for Israel’s iniquity, and forty days on his right side depicting punishment for Judah’s iniquity.  Terrible famine develops within the city, as symbolized by Ezekiel eating bread made of mixed grain measured out in the small amount of twenty shekels (ounces) a day and drinking but one hin (quart) of water a day. To his horror, he shall prepare the food in a defiling manner, contrary to the Levitical law. The Lord said “this shall be the way you will eat your food (in a defiled manner) in the nations where you will be banished.”<br />
In verse 1 he is told to take thee a tile. The bricks, or tile, were larger in those days than in ours. They were at least 13´´ by 13´´ by 4´´. It was large enough to accommodate a plan of the city. He drew a picture of Jerusalem, built a fort, which was a siege wall or tower, then connected the two with battering rams, or ramps, and arranged an army camp (soldiers) to besiege it. The strength of the besiegers and the impossibility of escape was represented by the iron pan that Ezekiel set up in verse 3.</p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel Portrays The Death And Scattering Of The People (Chapter 5)<br />
</strong>In chapter five we have the sign of the sharp knife. All of the signs show the chastisement and judgment still to come upon Israel because of her rebellion against the Lord.</p>
<p>With a sharp sword, using it as a barber’s knife, Ezekiel is to cut off the hair from his head and face. This he is to carefully divide into three parts. One-third he shall put in the city of Jerusalem (the miniature sketched on the tile) and burn it; one-third shall be put around the city, while at the same time, cutting it to pieces; and one-third shall be scattered out to the wind. The meaning is that the sword is the king of Babylon. The hair represents the inhabitants of Jerusalem, of which one-third will be destroyed in the siege, one-third killed by the sword when the siege finally breaks the city, and the remaining one-third scattered among the nations where they will continue to be afflicted.</p>
<p>Then the Lord reveals why Jerusalem and the nation that it represents must go through such terrible chastisement and judgment. The Lord had selected her and her people Israel (when He chose Abraham) to be a testimony in the midst of the nations of His greatness, holiness, goodness, and love. But Israel rebelled by rejecting the Lord and all that He represented and went her own way, serving idols, shedding blood, and becoming even worse than her heathen neighbors.  God’s holiness must be preserved at all costs. The sinning rebels among Israel must be cut off, and the erring remnant must be subjected to chastisement in order to purify them.</p>
<p>The means the Lord uses for judgment are: famine, which can be brought about through siege, hail, rain, mice, locusts, and mildew; wild beasts multiplying, leaving their natural habitat and going on a carnage; bloodshed, brought by the sword of the Lord wielded in the hands of enemies; and dispersion among the nations away from Jerusalem, so they will be constantly reminded by the Lord’s chastening hand to turn back to Him.</p>
<p>The context of the book very clearly makes the sword represent the king of Babylon. Balances were used for dividing the hair into three parts. This points to the justice of God. Note that one-third was not cut off, but was subjected to chastisement rather than judgment. God always remembers His remnant.</p>
<p>When man had failed before the Flood (and Noah and his posterity after the Flood) to walk righteously before the Lord, then God began again by choosing a man through whom He planned to make Himself and His blessings of salvation known to mankind. He chose Abraham and the nation of Israel that would issue from him. He plucked him out of the center of idolatry in Ur of Chaldea and set him in a pleasant land. There, Israel was to be a testimony of God’s greatness and goodness to all the nations about her. God blessed her and raised her above the other nations of the world.</p>
<p>Israel forgot the Lord and became worse than the nations about her. However, in view of the greater knowledge that she had than her neighbors, she did more wickedly. Details of her wickedness will be noted in later chapters.  When Israel was young and disobedient as a nation, God did not destroy her in a great calamity. He restrained the nations, lest they say that He who had brought them out of Egypt could not preserve them. But when Israel continuously rebelled against God and turned from Him to idols, it became necessary that God demonstrate by His greatness and majesty, both to Israel and to the heathen neighbors, that He indeed is the Lord.</p>
<p>These calamities would come upon Jerusalem because the people acted more wickedly than the surrounding nations, in spite of their greater privileges.<br />
We as Christians have even higher privileges than the Jews. May the Lord give us grace not to misuse them and thus bring about our own temporal judgment and loss of eternal rewards!</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 3:  Chapters 6 – 10</strong></p>
<p>The Destruction of Idolatry and Preservation of a Remnant (Chap. 6)<br />
The mountains of Israel are used here to refer to idolatry, since idol shrines (high places) were commonly built on mountains. The land would be punished for its idolatry.</p>
<p>A remnant would be spared; these would remember the Lord in their captivity and loathe themselves for &#8230; their abominations (vv. 8–10). Idolatry would be punished by pestilence, warfare, and famine (vv. 11–14).  In every age, God maintains a remnant testimony for Himself—not the moral majority but the despised minority.</p>
<p><strong>The Imminence and Severity of the Babylonian Invasion (Chap. 7)<br />
</strong>The time for God’s judgment to fall had come, and there would be no question that it was the LORD who was striking (vv. 1–13). No one would answer the call to battle; courage and strength would fail because of the awful destruction (vv. 14–18).   Material possessions would be useless (v. 19). Because the temple (“the beauty of his ornaments”) had been polluted with idols, it would be given to strangers—the Babylonians. They would plunder it and defile it (vv. 20–22).</p>
<p>All classes would be affected by the desolation—the king, princes, prophets, priests, elders, and common people. The common people should have been a testimony to God, but they totally failed. The only testimony that can be given to God now is through judgment. What a solemn thought. The judgment is complete: all classes and all the land. Any nation that rejects the knowledge of God loses its moral fiber, and has no means of support when trouble comes. This is true of individuals, too.</p>
<p><strong>The Vision of Gross Idolatry in the Temple (Chap. 8)<br />
</strong>The elders had to witness the judgment, which they had failed to help to avert. This often happens today, too. The Lord carried Ezekiel from Babylon to Jerusalem in visions. There he saw some terrible examples of the idolatry of the people. He saw an abominable idolatrous image in the entrance of the temple  which provoked the Lord to jealousy.  The second thing the prophet saw was in the court of the temple. The elders of Judah were assembled there each with a censer in his hand, worshiping vile pictures portrayed all around on the walls.  The third sight was at the north gate; the women were weeping for Tammuz, a Babylonian deity. The vegetation supposedly dried up when he died.<br />
The fourth instance of idolatry was in the inner court of the temple, where about twenty-five men, representing the priests, were worshiping the sun and following the lewd practices of that cult.  To put the branch to the nose indicated contempt or scorn for God. The branch was an obscene phallic symbol. </p>
<p>God views idolatry as the most abominable kind of sin that man can engage in. Other sins are against lower forms of creation: against his fellow man and himself.  But idolatry is against the Lord God Himself.  When man practices idolatry he either refuses to recognize Him at all, or at best places Him alongside the many lesser gods.  When man fails to give due recognition and worship to God, he then becomes a law to himself.  Whatever he wishes to do he may then have a rational reason for so doing.  It is for this reason that the first of the Ten Commandments is “Thou shalt have no other gods before me” (Ex 20:3).</p>
<p><strong>The Removal of God’s Presence and the Destruction of Idolaters (Chap. 9)<br />
</strong>In this chapter, six executioners are seen coming from the north (the direction from which the Babylonians were to come) to destroy the idolaters of the previous chapter.  The glory cloud of the Shekinah (God’s presence) leaves the holy of holies in the temple, grieved away by the idolatry of the people. The glory cloud moves to the threshold of the temple where its brightness fills the court.  Those faithful Jews who opposed the idolatry were sealed by a mark on their foreheads so that they would not be killed. This verse should challenge us. How do we react, if some do not follow the Lord? Do we join them? Will they influence us? Do we justify them? Do we show indifference? These faithful men and women sighed and cried; this reaction showed what was in their heart and kept them from judgment.  The sign—or mark on the forehead—was the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet (tav), which the rabbis said suggested completeness. It is also the first letter of torah (law).  Notes the remarkable similarity between what is stated here and in Revelation 7:1–3. In the earlier form of Hebrew script the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet (tav) had the form of a cross.</p>
<p>Then the executioners began to slay the idolaters, starting with the elders.  “Do not come near anyone on whom is the mark,” says God.  When Ezekiel interceded for the people, the Lord said that He would not spare or have pity. The people were saying that because the LORD God had forsaken them and no longer saw their plight, they owed no loyalty to Him. “The Lord does not see” sounds like a very modern quotation!  See 1st Peter 4:17.</p>
<p><strong>The Vision of God’s Glory Visiting Jerusalem with Judgment (Chap. 10)<br />
</strong>Chapter 10 is closely linked with Chapter 1, giving further information about the throne-chariot, the living creatures (here identified as cherubim), and the glory of the Lord. However, Chapter 1 was addressed to the exiles whereas this is addressed to rebels in Jerusalem.  The Lord commanded the man clothed in linen to take burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over Jerusalem. This signified God’s judgment that was to be poured out on the city.</p>
<p>The saddest event witnessed by Ezekiel was the departure of the LORD’s glory from the temple. The glory moved from the cherubim in the holy of holies to the threshold of the house. Later, “the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold and stood over the cherubim”, when the cherubim went and stood “at the door of the east gate”.   The fact that the Spirit of God was not present in the temple explains how Nebuchadnezzar’s men were later, in 586 B.C., able to destroy the temple completely, including the Holy of Holies, without divine judgment.</p>
<p>A detailed description of the cherubim and the wheels of the throne-chariot is given.  The glory cloud next moves from the threshold to the east gate of the LORD’s house.  Ezekiel then emphasized that the cherubim were the same as the living creature he had seen by the River Chebar in chapter 1.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 4:  Chapters 11– 14 </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Repudiation of the Counsel of Wicked Princes (11:1–13)<br />
</strong>The twenty-five men (representing the princes) were advising the people of the city that there was nothing to fear. They could carry on their construction projects as usual. They were as secure as meat encased in an iron caldron. Thus the twenty-five men flatly contradicted the word of the Lord, which said: “The time is not near to build &#8230; .” God had given orders through Jeremiah (Jer. 29:4–11) that the captives would build houses in Babylon because Jerusalem would fall. The men who devise iniquity tried to awaken false hopes among the captives by letters. Despite the fire of God’s judgment, the princes in Jerusalem felt quite safe there.  In the same way, many nominal Christians feel safe from God’s judgment despite the sin in their lives.</p>
<p>Ezekiel was told to reinterpret their symbolism quite differently.  The city of Jerusalem was the caldron, and the slain people were the meat! They themselves would be taken out of the city and judged at the border of Israel (see 2 Kgs. 25:18–21; Jer. 5:24–27).  When Pelatiah (the leader of the twenty-five men) dropped dead, seemingly as a result of his evil counsel, Ezekiel interceded to GOD for his people.</p>
<p><strong>The Preservation of a Remnant Promised (11:14–21)<br />
</strong>The LORD answered by telling the prophet what the inhabitants of Jerusalem had been saying, namely, that the exiles had wandered far from the LORD and that the land belonged to those remaining in Judah and Jerusalem.  But the Lord GOD promised that He would be a little sanctuary to the exiles, and that He would re-gather them to the land of Israel, completely cleansed of idolatry and with a heart to obey the Lord.  Ezekiel follows Jeremiah in urging spiritual religion. It is definitely a heart religion that God wants. The heart is beyond repair; and a new one will be provided.  The spiritual emphasis will give them a relationship with God that will transform their thinking, their worship, their conduct and their loyalty.  The promise of one heart (one of flesh) and a new spirit are unconditional; they are yet to be fulfilled in the New Covenant.</p>
<p><strong>The Removal of the Glory Cloud to the Mount of Olives (11:22–25)<br />
</strong>At the close of the chapter, the glory cloud rises from the city and goes to the Mount of Olives, to the east side of Jerusalem. Thus did the God of Israel in lingering love forsake His city and temple, not to return till 43:2 (still future).<br />
Ezekiel’s Signs of the Coming Exile (Chap. 12)</p>
<p><strong>1. His Baggage (12:1–16)<br />
</strong>Ezekiel was commanded to move his household goods from one place to another, as a sign to the Jews that they would be moving off into captivity. By digging through the wall at night with his eyes covered, he predicted that Zedekiah (the prince) would flee from the city at twilight (when he could not see the ground).   However, he would be captured and taken to Babylon, though he would never see it with his eyes (v. 13). This is exactly what happened. Zedekiah was captured as he fled from Jerusalem, his eyes were put out at Riblah, and then he was carried to Chaldea (2 Kgs. 25:7). The people would be scattered among the nations, and many of them would die from the sword, famine, and pestilence.</p>
<p><strong>2. His Quaking (12:17–28)<br />
</strong>When Ezekiel ate and drank with trembling and quaking, he gave a pre-picture of the fear and anxiety that would precede the exile.  The people had a proverb that God’s prophecies of doom were never fulfilled. God gave them another proverb, announcing that the day of fulfillment was at hand, and that every prophecy (vision) would come to pass. Those who said that the fulfillment was yet future would see it in their own day.  The people’s tendency to explain the prophecies away or apply them to future generations is still with us. When God speaks to us through a message or a book, we immediately seem to know how our brother or sister should apply it and change. It is an evil and destructive tendency to apply God’s Word to others and not to our own lives.  We should also watch out for clichés that contradict God’s Word or that deny or postpone His intervention.</p>
<p><strong>The Doom of the False Prophets and Prophetesses (Chap. 13)</strong><br />
The subject here is false prophets (vv. 1–16) and false prophetesses (vv. 17–23). The former invented prophecies out of their own heart; they would fail the people when most needed. They used the words, “The LORD says,” but it was a lie, a false divination.  Today we need preachers and teachers who don’t give  their own thoughts and opinions, but who get their message in prayer, and from God’s Word.  A Commentator named Denis Lane gives the following characteristics of the preaching in Ezekiel’s day:  “It never rose higher than the preachers’ own minds. It deceptively claimed to be God’s word. It had no practical or useful effect. It offered cheap grace and a false peace. It simply endorsed the latest world view.”  False religious leaders, like foxes in the deserts, are always looking for prey in the midst of destruction, filling their own needs and desires. In a situation like this it is the preacher’s duty to stand in the gaps to intercede and to repair the wall by leading people to repentance and a holy life. This is done by preaching God’s Word.<br />
These false prophets and prophetesses would be destroyed for predicting peace when there was no peace, for whitewashing a wall that was ready to crumble (daubing it with un-tempered mortar). The wall represented the rulers’ efforts to prevent the divine judgment.</p>
<p>The prophetesses practiced witchcraft, putting magic charms on people’s wrists and veils on their heads. They doomed some people to death by magic spells and kept others alive. GOD would deliver His people and destroy these false prophetesses.</p>
<p><strong>God’s Threat to the Idolatrous Elders (Chap. 14)<br />
</strong>When some of the elders of Israel—idolaters at heart— visited Ezekiel to get counsel from the Lord, the LORD announced that He would answer idolaters directly, not through a prophet. If a prophet did answer the idolaters, he would be deceived and would be punished together with the inquirers.  Even if three righteous men like Noah, Daniel, and Job should be in the land, God would not hearken but would send famine, wild beasts, the sword, and pestilence on the land. Daniel was living at the court of Nebuchadnezzar when Ezekiel wrote, and yet he was reckoned with God’s righteous men of old. It is not true that there cannot be heroes and heroines of the faith today as there have been in former times. Will you be one of them?</p>
<p>If He would severely judge any land, how much more Jerusalem, where His temple was located. But a remnant would be saved to testify that the LORD was justified in doing what He did.  Judah’s guilt was too great to be pardoned, even through the intercession of Noah, Daniel, and Job. What about our society with its crime, violence, abortion, immorality, idolatry, drugs, and secular humanism?<br />
<strong>Lesson 5:    Chapters  15 &#8211; 18</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Fruitless Vine (Chap. 15)<br />
</strong>A vine is good only for bearing fruit; it is not good for making furniture or even a little peg. If it has been charred in a fire, it is even more useless. In one sense, the vine is the people of Jerusalem (v. 6). Failing to bear fruit for God, they were charred by the fire of the Babylonian invasion. But in a wider sense the vine represents the entire nation, including both Israel and Judah (v. 4). The northern end of the branch was charred by the Assyrians. The southern end was charred by the Egyptians. And now the middle, i.e., Jerusalem, would be charred by the Babylonians (see 2 Kgs. 25:9). The second fire of verse 7 pictures the captivity of those who escaped. God has determined to make the land desolate (v. 8).<br />
As believers we have high privileges, but also the responsibility to produce fruit for God’s glory. If we don’t glorify Him with our life, our existence is vain and useless. It is like the vine without fruit, and our testimony will be destroyed (cf. John 15:6). As branches in Christ, the True Vine, our chief function is to bear fruit for God. Primarily that means the development of Christian character as seen in the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of Jerusalem’s Marriage (Chap. 16)<br />
</strong>The LORD here traces the history of Jerusalem, as a type of the people. It began as a foundling child, unwashed and unwanted. The Lord had pity on her and cared for her lovingly, and she grew, matured, and became very beautiful.<br />
When she came to young womanhood, Jehovah betrothed Himself to her, purified her for marriage, lavished kindnesses upon her, and adorned her. But because she trusted in her own beauty, she turned from Him to idols, becoming a harlot to everyone who passed by.  Instead of trusting in the Lord, she played the prostitute to such Gentiles as the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the traders of Chaldea. As someone has said, “She out-heathened the heathen.” She was unlike the usual harlot in that she hired others to sin with her! Who would do something like that? Is it possible that the harlot will pay the man? That she will give her precious possessions away? And yet many who say they follow the Lord give up their precious rewards and inheritance above, spend their money and time on worldly pleasures instead of laying up treasures in heaven. They compromise with the world and lose eternal reward and blessing. This is called spiritual adultery, and whoever is engaged in it pays a high price.</p>
<p>The judgment on her filthiness was that she would be destroyed by the Gentile nations which she solicited as lovers for hire. Those who turn from God like an unfaithful lover and make compromises with the world will be destroyed by the world they wanted to befriend. This is a solemn warning to us (cf. Jas. 4:4–10).<br />
The abominations committed by Jerusalem (Judah) were worse than those of her heathen predecessors, the Hittites, Amorites, Samaria, or Sodom. Sexual perversion was only one of Sodom’s sins. The iniquity of Sodom also included fullness of food and abundance of idleness. This reads only too much like a description of modern Christendom!</p>
<p>Notice how pride was singled out as the root of Sodom’s sin when her abominations were traced to their source. God had blessed her abundantly with fullness of bread (Gen. 13:10), but she monopolized these blessings for her own pleasures and basked in prosperous ease. Provision for her own needs made her insensible to the needs of others; she had no social conscience. Then she committed the abominations and enormities which are linked inseparably with her name. God took her away with a final blow when He saw it (Gen. 18:21).</p>
<p>In grace, God will restore in the future. Verse 53 describes the restoration of cities but in no way suggests the eventual salvation of the wicked dead.  He will establish an everlasting covenant with His people, and Judah will be ashamed that she ever forsook the Lord for idols.</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Two Eagles (Chap. 17)<br />
</strong>The LORD told Ezekiel to pose a riddle to the house of Israel. A great eagle came to Lebanon, broke off the topmost twig from a cedar tree, and carried it to a foreign land. It also took the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil. There it grew into a spreading vine.  Then the vine began to grow toward another great eagle, but it no longer thrived.</p>
<p>The LORD Himself gives the interpretation of the allegory. The first eagle was Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon (v. 12). He carried off Jehoiachin, king of Judah (the topmost twig), from Jerusalem (Lebanon) into Babylon (land of traffic), and Babylon (city of merchants). He also took Zedekiah, the king’s offspring, and set him up as his vassal king in Judah (v. 13). For a while, Zedekiah, a low spreading vine, flourished in the homeland, but then he turned to the king of Egypt (another great eagle) for deliverance from Babylonia. When Zedekiah broke the covenant with Nebuchadnezzar (2 Chron. 36:13), it was the same as if he broke it with God (v. 19). As a result, Zedekiah would be carried into Babylon and die there; Pharaoh-Hophra would not be able to help him (vv. 16–21).</p>
<p>In these verses the coming of the Messiah (the tender twig) is promised; He would be descended from the house of David. He would be a fruitful tree and afford safety to the people (v. 23). The God of hope does not leave them hopeless, but directs their eyes towards the Messiah. We also should have the future in view and comfort each other with these truths.   Politics always proves to be a washout. Only the return of Christ offers any hope to this sin-drugged world.</p>
<p><strong>The Repudiation of the Parable of the Sour Grapes (Chap. 18)<br />
</strong>The people of Judah had a proverb which blamed their sins on the failure of their ancestors: “The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children’s teeth are set on edge.”  God refutes the proverb, stating that individuals are held responsible for their own sins.  He then gives several examples of His principles of judgment:</p>
<p>1. A man who shuns sin and lives righteously shall surely live (vv. 5–9).<br />
2. A righteous man’s wicked son shall surely die (vv. 10–13).   The Jews during the captivity as well as in the Lord Jesus’ time prided themselves on having Abraham as their father (Luke 3:8, John 8:39). God points out that it will do no good to have a righteous father, if their own life is wicked. We also have the tendency to rely on the spirituality of others. But the righteous and holy life of our fathers and godly leaders must become a reality in our own lives.<br />
3. An unrighteous man’s righteous son shall surely live (vv.14–17), but the unrighteous father shall die for his iniquities (v. 18).<br />
4. A wicked man who repents and turns from his sins will live (vv. 21–23).<br />
5. A righteous man who turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity shall die (v. 24).</p>
<p>There is no contradiction between verse 20 and Exodus 20:5. It is true, as taught in Exodus, that children are generally involved in the consequences of their parents’ misdeeds. It is also true, as taught here, that each one is personally responsible for his or her actions.  In verse 20, the punishment is temporal, not eternal. It is physical death because of sin now. The principles stated in verses 5–24 are not dealing with eternal life; otherwise we would be forced to conclude that salvation is by works (vv. 5–9) and that the righteous may eventually be lost, two doctrines clearly refuted by our Lord in the NT (e.g., Eph. 2:8, 9; John 10:28).</p>
<p>The people continued to accuse God of injustice, but He shows that there is no injustice because even a wicked man can be saved by turning from his sins,  and that is what the Lord wants them to do.  When God forgives, He forgets (v. 22). This does not indicate a poor memory but the perfect satisfaction of His justice through the atoning work of Christ. For the believer the case is closed.<br />
<strong>Lesson 6:    Chapters  19 &#8211; 21</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lamentation for the Last Kings of Judah (Chap. 19)<br />
</strong>This is a lament for the last kings of Judah,  Jehoahaz, Jehoiachin, and Zedekiah. Judah is the lioness. The other nations are the lions, and their rulers are the young lions (v. 2). The whelp who became a young lion (v. 3) is  Jehoahaz, who was captured and taken off to Egypt (v. 4). The other whelp (v. 5) is Jehoiachin. Judah was no different than all the other nations, a lioness among the lions. The leaders of the nations are fierce and selfish, “but among you it shall not be so.” The Lord expects His people to be different.  If not, they are inviting His judgment.</p>
<p>“Your mother” (v. 10) is Judah or Jerusalem, a vine in their bloodline that was fruitful and full of branches. At one time, she had strong kings (strong branches), but she would be destroyed by Babylon (the east wind), and the people carried into captivity (the wilderness, vv. 11–13). Zedekiah, the fire of verse 14, is regarded as a usurper and the ruin of his people.  Israel had wanted a king like the other nations. Here Ezekiel lowers the curtain on the last act of their monarchy. God wants His people to be different from the world, to be a holy people for Himself, and to acknowledge Him as King.</p>
<p><strong>Vindication of God’s Dealings with Israel (20:1–32)<br />
1. Idolatry in Egypt (20:1–9)<br />
</strong>When the elders came to Ezekiel to inquire of the LORD, He refused to be inquired of by them. Instead He recounted their repeated rebellions against Him. The elders were quite conservative and orthodox in their practice of their religion; but their hearts were far from Him.  Idols keep us from getting God’s answers to our questions. When God recounts our sins and shows us His grace by leading us to repentance, many of us get bored: “We’ve heard that so often.” “The Bible is just full of do’s and don’ts.” “Is there nothing else but judgment in it?” Instead of reacting properly to God’s Word, we are in danger of staying lukewarm.  In spite of their idolatry in the land of Egypt (vv. 4–8a), God did not punish them there so that the Gentiles would not mock (vv. 8b–9).</p>
<p><strong>2. Defiling God’s Sabbaths (20:10–17)<br />
</strong>Israel profaned God’s Sabbaths in the wilderness (vv. 10–13a). Again the Lord restrained His wrath and spared them from destruction lest the heathen should laugh (vv. 13b–17).</p>
<p><strong>3. Rebellion in the Wilderness (20:18–26)<br />
</strong>The rebellion of the children of the original generation in the wilderness is recalled (vv. 18–21a); again God held back His anger against them (vv. 21b–26).</p>
<p><strong>4. Idolatry (20:27–32)<br />
</strong>Their terrible idolatry in the land of promise even included making their sons pass through the fire, that is, offering them as human sacrifices.</p>
<p><strong>God’s Promise of Eventual Restoration (20:33–44)<br />
</strong>In spite of their efforts, God would never let them become permanently like the Gentiles, serving wood and stone (v. 32). He would re-gather them from the peoples of captivity, set them in judgment before Him, receive the righteous (v. 37), and purge the rebels from among them (v. 38).   When the nation is restored to the land of Israel, they will no longer worship idols, but they will worship the LORD in holiness (vv. 39–44). </p>
<p><strong>Pictures of the Imminent Invasion (20:45–21:32)<br />
1. The Sign of the Forest Fire (20:45–49)<br />
</strong>Verse 45 marks the beginning of chapter 21 in the Hebrew Bible, a more logical place to break, as our outline indicates. In verses 45–49, we have a prophecy against the South (Heb. Negev, part of Judah); it will be destroyed by the forest fire (Babylonian invasion).</p>
<p><strong>2. The Sign of the Drawn Sword (21:1–17)</strong><br />
God expresses His determination to lay waste Judah and Jerusalem with His sharpened sword. Ezekiel’s sighing was to warn the people of the fearfulness of God’s coming judgment.  The sword of Babylon is prepared for the slaughter (vv. 8–13) and will satisfy the fury of Jehovah (vv. 14–17). Verses 10c and 13 mean this: It was no time for Judah to make mirth. They had despised all previous weapons of affliction, which are spoken of in the NKJV as having been made of wood. Now they would experience a sword made of steel, and there was the possibility that the scepter that despises, i.e., Judah, would be no more.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Sign of the Fork in the Road (21:18–32)<br />
</strong>Next, the king of Babylon is seen marching toward the land. He comes to a fork in the road: One branch leads to Jerusalem, and the other to Rabbah (capital of Ammon). Which city shall he attack first? He uses three means of divination: (1) He marks an arrow for Jerusalem and one for Rabbah; (2) He consults his household gods; (3) He looks into the liver of some slaughtered animal. The decision? Attack Jerusalem first!<br />
Zedekiah is the profane, wicked prince of verse 25. His kingship is overthrown and he will be the last king over God’s people until the Messiah comes, whose right it is to reign.  During the time of Christ, Israel had a king, but he was under the authorities of the Romans (so was truly an independent king). </p>
<p>The Ammonites will next be attacked by the king of Babylon; they will be utterly destroyed.  History and current events are full of instances of God overturning human governments until Christ comes, whose right it is to reign.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 7:    Chapters  22 – 24</strong></p>
<p><strong>Three Oracles on Jerusalem’s Defilement (Chap. 22)<br />
</strong>Here is presented a catalog of the sins of Jerusalem—bloodshed (v. 9) (meaning human sacrifices in this context) and idolatry (vv. 3, 4); murder (v. 6); contempt of parents, oppression of strangers, orphans and widows (v. 7); desecrating the temple and breaking the Sabbaths (v. 8); slander, idolatry and lewdness (v. 9); immorality (v. 10); adultery, incest (v. 11); bribery, usury, extortion, and forgetfulness of the LORD GOD (v. 12).</p>
<p>For these sins of dishonest profit and bloodshed, the people would be scattered among the nations (vv. 13–16). Jerusalem would be like a refiner’s pot, in which the people, like worthless dross, would be melted (vv. 17–22).   All classes of society were guilty before the Lord—rulers (v. 25) [“prophets” in the KJV and NKJV reads “princes” in the Septuagint]; priests (v. 26); magistrates (v. 27); prophets (v. 28); people (v. 29). Not a righteous man could be found, not a reformer nor an intercessor to stand for God (vv. 30, 31).  God is not looking for new methods or programs; God is always looking for someone to stand in the gap. One person can make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Two Harlot Sisters (Chap. 23)<br />
1. Oholah (23:1–10)<br />
</strong>This is the parable of two harlot sisters, Oholah the elder and Oholibah her sister. Oholah was Samaria, and Oholibah was Jerusalem.  Oholah means [she has] her own tent. Samaria had set up her own center of worship. God’s temple was in Jerusalem. Oholah played the harlot to the good-looking and macho horsemen of Assyria; therefore, she was abandoned to her lovers by God, and they uncovered her nakedness and slew her with the sword.</p>
<p><strong>2. Oholibah (23:11–21)<br />
</strong>Oholibah (my tent is in her) went even further in her idolatrous harlotry and immorality. First she lusted after the Assyrians, just as Israel had done (vv. 12, 13). Then she doted on the images of the men of Babylon portrayed in vermilion. She lusted for them and sent messengers to them, inviting them to her land (2 Kgs. 16:7). Recalling her youthful sins in the land of Egypt, she also multiplied her harlotry and gave herself over to the Babylonians to commit terrible immorality.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Invasion of the Babylonians (23:22–35)<br />
</strong>As a result, God would destroy Oholibah by her Babylonian lovers. Those desirable young men she lusted after would treat her hatefully. She tried to find satisfaction in the fleshly world, apart from God. Now her sins must be judged. Verses 33 and 34 describe the symptoms of depression and despair, which we find all over today. Only if we drink of God’s living water, will we never thirst again.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Judgment of Oholah and Oholibah (23:36–49)<br />
</strong>Both sisters were guilty of the same sins: adultery (literal and spiritual), murder, offering human sacrifices (v. 37); desecration of the temple, Sabbath-breaking (v. 38); mixing idolatry with worship of God (v. 39); committing spiritual adultery with foreign nations (vv. 40–44). Righteous men (nations chosen by God) would repay the sisters for their lewdness with well-deserved destruction (vv. 45–49).<br />
Judah’s religion was a combination of  the worship of Jehovah with idolatry and paganism. Much of modern Christendom, sad to say, combines elements of the Bible with Judaism, paganism, eastern religion, humanism, and psychology.</p>
<p><strong>The Parable of the Boiling Pot (24:1–14)<br />
</strong>On the day the siege of Jerusalem began, Ezekiel spoke the parable of the boiling pot. The pot was Jerusalem; the pieces of meat were the people. The pot was about to boil. It had scum, or rust, in it—the lewdness of idolatry. After the pot was thoroughly emptied, it would be burned to remove the scum. Thus would the LORD seek to purge His people of idolatry.</p>
<p><strong>The Sign of the Death of Ezekiel’s Wife (24:15–27)<br />
</strong>Ezekiel was warned that his wife, the desire of his eyes, would die. She died on the evening of that day, and, contrary to all normal reactions, he was commanded not to mourn.   When the people asked the meaning of his strange behavior, he told them that when the desire of their eyes (the temple) would be destroyed and their sons and daughters would be killed, they were not to mourn.  One purpose of fulfilled prophecy is to let the world know who is the Lord GOD (v. 24).</p>
<p>Ezekiel was not to utter any more prophecies to Judah until a fugitive brought him the news that their stronghold had fallen. That event is recorded in 33:21-22. The intervening chapters, 25–32, are prophecies to Gentile nations, not to Judah.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 8:    Chapters  25 – 32</strong></p>
<p><strong>PROPHECIES AGAINST SEVEN GENTILE NATIONS<br />
</strong>In these chapters we read of God’s judgment on seven heathen nations. These nations are judged for various forms of rebellion against God. They had contact with God’s people, knew about Him, but were unwilling to turn to Him. We need to observe this closely, for God’s ways always reveal His thoughts, whether in judgment or in grace.</p>
<p><strong>Prophecy against Ammon (25:1–7)<br />
</strong>The first nation upon which judgment is pronounced is Ammon. Because the Ammonites rejoiced at the fall of God’s sanctuary, Israel and Judah, and the Babylonian captivity, they would be destroyed by the Babylonians (men of the East). Rabbah would become a stable for camels and Ammon a resting place for flocks.</p>
<p><strong>Prophecy against Moab (25:8–11)<br />
</strong>The second nation is Moab, which shared with Seir a hostile attitude toward Judah. The land of Moab would be opened to the Babylonians and would suffer the same fate as Ammon. The territory would be cleared of its cities, and Moab would know that God is the LORD.</p>
<p><strong>Prophecy against Edom (25:12–14)<br />
</strong>The third nation is Edom. Because it took vengeance against the house of Judah, the Lord GOD said, it would know His vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>Prophecy against Philistia (25:15–17)<br />
</strong>The Philistines are the fourth people. Their never-ending hatred of Judah would bring upon them the vengeance of the LORD.</p>
<p><strong>Prophecy against Tyre (26:1–28:19)<br />
1. The Destruction of Tyre (Chap. 26)<br />
</strong>The fifth object of God’s judgment is the seacoast city of Tyre. Its punishment extends from 26:1 to 28:19. Super-commercial Tyre rejoiced when it heard that its rival city, Jerusalem, had fallen, thinking that it would now get all the business! Jerusalem had controlled all the overland trade routes, and its fall meant freer traffic for Tyre with Egypt and other southern countries.</p>
<p>God would use many nations to chastise this city-state. The predictions of verses 4–6 have been literally fulfilled. First Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, king of kings, marched against Tyre from the north and attacked it (vv. 7–11). The siege was extremely long—about 587 B.C.–574 B.C.</p>
<p>But the people fled with their possessions to an offshore island, also called Tyre. They remained secure there for 250 years. Then Alexander the Great built a causeway to the island by scraping clean the original city and throwing the rubble into the sea. This action by Alexander’s soldiers (332 B.C.) is described in this paragraph. Over a hundred years ago a traveler described the ruins of Tyre as being exactly as predicted:  “The island, as such, is not more than a mile in length. The part which projects south beyond the isthmus is perhaps a quarter of a mile broad, and is rocky and uneven. It is now unoccupied except by fishermen, as “a place to spread nets upon.”</p>
<p>Tyre has never been rebuilt—a fulfillment of verse 21. In his book, Science Speaks, Peter Stoner says that this entire prophecy concerning Tyre, considering all the details, using the principle of probability, had a one-in-four hundred million chance of fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Dirge over Tyre (Chap. 27)</strong><br />
Tyre is likened to a beautiful ship, luxurious in its construction, with materials in it from all over the world. Tyre was not a military force which conquered the world; the Tyrians were merchants. All kinds of merchandise and knowledge were exchanged for the sake of personal gain. This is commonly accepted, but all beauty and knowledge apart from the Lord Jesus is empty.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Downfall of the Prince of Tyre (28:1–19)<br />
</strong>The pride, wisdom, and wealth of the prince of Tyre are described in verses 1–6, and then his destruction by the Babylonians (vv. 7–10). No doubt this prince foreshadows the antichrist.  In verse 11 there is a change from the prince of Tyre to the king of Tyre. The latter is the spirit that animated the prince. The king of Tyre was noted for his beauty, but because of his pride he was destroyed.  The description of the king of Tyre as the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty, as having been in Eden, the garden of God, as having every precious stone as a covering, as being the anointed cherub, and as having been on the holy mountain of God, are taken together to be a description of Satan and of his fall from heaven. Feinberg explains:<br />
Ezekiel &#8230; appeared to have the situation of his day in mind with his attention riveted upon the ruler of Tyre, the embodiment of the people’s pride and godlessness. But as he viewed the thoughts and ways of that monarch, he clearly discerned behind him the motivating force and personality who was impelling him in his opposition to God. In short, he saw the work and activity of Satan, whom the king of Tyre was emulating in so many ways. Recall the incident in Matthew 16:21–23 where Peter was rebuked by our Lord Jesus. No sterner words were spoken to anyone in Christ’s earthly ministry. But He did not mean that Peter had somehow become Satan himself; He was indicating that the motivation behind Peter’s opposition to His going to Calvary was none other than the prince of the demons. This appears to be a similar situation.</p>
<p>If pride is deadly enough to destroy a most powerful and wise being, how much more should we mortals take heed not to walk independently of the Lord!</p>
<p><strong>Prophecy against Sidon (28:20–26)<br />
</strong>The sixth object of God’s judgment is Sidon. It was a seacoast city near Tyre. God warned that it would be subjected to pestilence and sword, but He did not say it would be destroyed forever. Sidon still stands today as a town in Lebanon, though biblical Tyre has been wiped out completely (see 26:21).<br />
28:24–26 These verses predict the restoration of Israel when the Lord GOD sets up His kingdom on the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Prophecy against Egypt (Chaps. 29–32)<br />
</strong>The seventh and last nation in this catalog of judgments is Egypt (Chaps. 29–32). These seem to be the most unsparing judgments of all. Without the River Nile, Egypt would be dead, and one would expect its people to cherish life. But no, Egypt is the land of death. Its most famous book is the Book of the Dead. Its greatest monuments are the pyramids, which are huge tombs. Its kings built small palaces but huge sepulchers, and they were embalmed to enjoy their time in the grave! The heart of the Egyptian is quite unimpressed facing death, full of self-assertion. Therefore judgment had to come over Egypt, which nation in the Bible is a picture of the world, especially as being without God.</p>
<p><strong>1. General Threat against Pharaoh and His People (Chap. 29)<br />
</strong>In verses 1–5, Pharaoh is compared to a crocodile in the great River Nile. This crocodile is proud, but short-sighted. The fish are the people of Egypt. All are to be punished by God. In looking to Egypt for help, Israel had leaned on a broken reed. Egypt receives the most severe judgment because it was unreliable and untrustworthy.  Because of Pharaoh’s pride, the land of Egypt would be desolate for forty years.  Then God would gather the people, but Egypt would never be a great kingdom again, and Israel would no longer look to it for help.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar had worked hard besieging Tyre, but received no wages for it (because the people fled to the island fortress with their possessions). Therefore God would give him Egypt as his wages.</p>
<p><strong>2. Lamentation over the Fall of Egypt (30:1–19)<br />
</strong>Egypt and all her allies—Ethiopia, Libya, and Lydia—would fall by the sword of the Babylonians.  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is named as the one who would destroy the land.   The leading cities of Egypt are listed as doomed to destruction with their idols and images.  The prophecy, “there shall no longer be princes from the land of Egypt” (v. 13), has been literally fulfilled. No full-blooded Egyptian of the royal family has reigned in Egypt since that time. King Farouk belonged to a dynasty that was founded by an Albanian in the early 1800’s. Farouk was the first member of the dynasty to have even a complete mastery of the Arabic language!</p>
<p><strong>3. The Downfall of Pharaoh (30:20–31:18)</strong><br />
Here the downfall of Egypt is seen in two stages. One of Pharaoh’s arms was broken figuratively when he was defeated in the battle of Carchemish (605 B.C.). The other was broken when the Babylonians invaded Egypt and conquered it.</p>
<p><strong>4. Lamentation over Pharaoh and Egypt (Chap. 32)</strong><br />
Pharaoh thought himself a young lion, but God looked upon him as a monster, which He would catch in His net and destroy. The king of Babylon would bring to nothing the pomp of Egypt, and the land would be left desolate and quiet. The nations lamented with tears. The LORD ordered Ezekiel to utter a lamentation over Egypt for all her multitude.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also shed tears for a city of murderers that would not accept Him and come under His protective wings. God cares for His creatures and does not enjoy judging them.  In verses 17–31, we have a view of Sheol (the Pit) where Egypt is sent. Assyria is there (vv. 22, 23) and Elam (vv. 24, 25), Meshech and Tubal (vv. 26, 27), Edom (v. 29), and the Sidonians (v. 30). Egypt had been great in this world, but in Sheol she is reduced to the same shame as the other nations (vv. 28, 31, 32). This finishes Ezekiel’s oracles against seven nations (and city-states).</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 9:    Chapters  33 –  37</strong></p>
<p>From chapter 33 to the end of the book, Ezekiel deals primarily with the restoration of Israel and the rebuilding of the temple.</p>
<p><strong>The Prophet Re-commissioned as a Watchman (Chap. 33)<br />
</strong>In this chapter, Ezekiel is again compared to a watchman. If he warns the people faithfully, but they do not hear, then they will be responsible for their own destruction. If he fails to warn the people, and they perish, God will require their blood at the watchman’s hand.  God held Ezekiel responsible for the house of Israel. The question arises for every believer: For whom will God hold us responsible? To whom shall we witness? Whom shall we warn? Our relatives, fellow workers, neighbors, friends? It is a solemn responsibility, and we do harm to our own soul if we do not fulfill it faithfully.</p>
<p>The people ask in despair: “How can we then live?” How many people today have lost all hope and are in depression and despair. The Lord’s answer is: Repent! There is hope for the worst sinner, but the only hope is in turning from sin, not in condoning it. The people complained that God’s dealings with them were not just, but He denies this, reminding them that He will pardon a wicked man who confesses and forsakes his sin; also, He will punish a righteous man who turns to wickedness.</p>
<p>In verses 21 and 22, Ezekiel’s mouth was opened, and he was no longer mute when an escapee from Jerusalem came and announced, “The city has been captured!” (see 24:27).</p>
<p>The next  verses apparently refer to the few Jews who were left in the land of Israel after the fall of Jerusalem. They argued that if one man—Abraham—had inherited the land, how much more right did such a group as they have to it. But God was interested in quality, not quantity. They were even then committing various forms of idolatry, and the land would have to be cleansed from such abominations, which testified against them. They were not true (spiritual) descendants of Abraham. Their outward profession would not save them from judgment because God was not interested in mere words, but in life (see James 2:14).</p>
<p>The people liked to listen to Ezekiel, but they had no intention of obeying his words! When his prophecies were fulfilled, they would know that a prophet had been in their midst.  We should come to the Word of God with the intention of obeying, and constantly checking our hearts, lest we fail to apply what we hear. The best response to a sermon is not, “That was a fine message,” but “God has spoken to me; I must do something.”</p>
<p><strong>The False Shepherds and the Good Shepherd (Chap. 34)<br />
</strong>The shepherds (rulers) were interested in themselves and not in the welfare of the sheep (the people). They ruled harshly, and the sheep became scattered.<br />
To this day many religious leaders have not learned the lesson of serving the sheep. They confuse their “service” with a means of gain.  The Lord allowed the flock to be scattered first in order to prevent further damage (v. 10).   A heart-rending picture is painted of the unfaithful preachers of Ezekiel’s day. The flock are scattered, untended and hungry while selfish shepherds pamper themselves and loll in idleness and luxury without any thought of their responsibility. They are careful to look out for their own food and clothing and comfort but no one else is to be considered for a minute.</p>
<p>Therefore God is determined to rescue His sheep from these false shepherds. But all the time He has blessing in mind, and so He will gather the sheep and take care of individual needs. The greatest blessing will be the relation between the Lord and His sheep, an intimate fellowship between God and man.  He will be their Shepherd and will gather them to the land and rule over them during the Millennium.  Evangelist D. L. Moody nicely outlines God’s ministry to His sheep:<br />
Notice the “I will’s” of the Lord God on behalf of his sheep.</p>
<p>V. 11 I will search them and seek them out.<br />
V. 12 I will deliver them.<br />
V. 13 I will bring them out.<br />
V. 13 I will gather them together.<br />
V. 13 I will bring them in.<br />
V. 14 I will feed them.<br />
V. 15 I will cause them to lie down.<br />
V. 16 I will bind up the broken.<br />
V. 16 I will strengthen the sick.</p>
<p>There are a good many lean sheep in God’s fold, but none in his pasture.<br />
Some people try to suggest that the God of the OT is a harsh and unloving Deity, in contrast to God as He is presented in the NT.   However, make sure to note that:  The picture of the shepherd searching out the wanderer, in verse 12, is a remarkable foreshadowing of the parable of the lost sheep (Luke 15:4), which our Lord doubtless based on this passage in Ezekiel.   It illustrates as clearly as anything can do the tender, loving qualities of the God of the Old Testament, and strikes a death-blow at those who try to drive a wedge between Yahweh, God of Israel, and the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Nor is it the only passage that speaks of the tender shepherd (see Psalms 78:52; 79:13; 80:1; Is. 40:11; 49:9;  Jeremiah 31:10).</p>
<p>In verses 17–24, the Lord GOD will also save His true sheep from the false shepherds, which are selfish and cruel. “My servant David” in verses 23 and 24 refers to the Lord Jesus, who is descended from David. The Hebrew Christian, David Baron, explains:  Even the Jews explained the name “David” in these passages as applying to the Messiah—the great Son of David in whom all the promises to the Davidic house are centered. Thus Kimchi, in his comment on Ezekiel 34:23, says: “My servant David—that is, the Messiah who shall spring from his seed in the time of salvation”: and in the 24th verse of chapter 37 he observes: “The King Messiah—His name shall be called David because He shall be of the seed of David.” And so practically all the Jewish commentators.</p>
<p>Verses 25–31 describe the security and prosperity of God’s flock during the future reign of Christ. Under a covenant of peace (v. 25) there shall be showers of blessing (v. 26) and a garden of renown (v. 29).  The ideal form of government is a beneficent, absolute monarchy with Christ as King.</p>
<p><strong>The Doom of Edom (Chap. 35)<br />
</strong>Mount Seir is Edom. That country is here denounced by the Lord because of its perpetual hatred of the Jews, its rejoicing when Jerusalem fell, its cruelty to the fugitives, and its plan to seize the land of Israel. Edom wanted the blessing, but they did not want the Lord. Apart from the Lord Jesus we cannot be blessed, and this still holds true today. Edom is doomed to perpetual desolation, with all trade cut off (v. 7).   Edom blasphemed the Jews and treated them as enemies. But the Lord still identified Himself with His people. They were under discipline, but not rejected. Edom failed to notice the difference.   As Edom rejoiced over the desolation of Israel, so the whole earth will rejoice over Edom’s destruction.<br />
God is displeased when believers secretly rejoice over the downfall of enemies of the faith. Love that is real does not feel even a quiet satisfaction when others are hurt, whether friends or foes.</p>
<p>The Restoration of the Land and the People (Chap. 36)<br />
Chapter 36 has been called “the Gospel according to Ezekiel,” largely because of verses 25–30.</p>
<p>The nations that seized the land of Israel and scorned God’s people, especially the nation of Edom, would be punished by Jehovah.  Israel’s cities and country places would be inhabited, the land would be more fertile and prosperous than ever, and the other nations would no longer taunt Israel.  Not only would the land be restored, but the people would be restored to the land. The reasons for their exile were bloodshed and idolatry; they caused the name of God to be profaned among the nations wherever they went.</p>
<p>Paul quotes verse 22 in Romans 2:24 in his indictment of Jewish inconsistencies in relation to the Gentiles and the law. In order to vindicate His own name, and not for Israel’s sake, God would restore the people to their homeland.   Verses 24–29 describe Israel’s spiritual regeneration. God would cleanse them, give them a new heart and a new spirit (the new birth), and save them from uncleanness.  Cleansing from sins, which corresponds to justification, and is not to be confused with sanctification, is followed by renewal with the Holy Spirit, which takes away the old heart of stone and puts within a new heart of flesh, so that the man can fulfill the commandments of God, and walk in newness of life.  When our Lord marveled at Nicodemus’s ignorance of the new birth, this passage in Ezekiel is surely one of the main texts that He expected him, as a teacher in Israel, to know (John 3:10).</p>
<p>Crops of grain and fruit would be increased, and they would never suffer famine again. All this the Lord would do, not because they deserved it, but for the honor of His Name.  The surrounding nations will know that God has repopulated and replanted the land. Men will then be as plentiful as the flocks of animals in Jerusalem on its feast days. These prophecies had a partial fulfillment when the Jews returned to the land from Babylon, but the complete fulfillment awaits the future reign of Christ.  Modern Israel achieved statehood in 1948. Jews are even now trickling back to the land in unbelief. It must soon be time for the Lord to initiate His “end time” calendar and program.</p>
<p><strong>The Vision of the Valley of Dry Bones (37:1–14)<br />
</strong>In the vision of verses 1 and 2, Ezekiel saw the dry bones of Israel and Judah in a valley. He was ordered to prophesy to the bones that they would come to life. With dramatic force the prophet presents the heartening news that Israel may hope to live.  A revival is possible!  Even dry bones, without sinew and flesh and blood, can live. The coming of God’s Spirit brings life. The same thrilling truth is still needed in a world that has dry bones everywhere. What we need is to have the Holy Spirit come with His quickening power that a genuine revival may sweep the earth.</p>
<p>The first time he spoke the Word of God, the sinews, flesh and skin came upon the bones.  The next time he prophesied to the wind or breath, and the breath came into the bodies. This pictured the national restoration of Israel (vv. 11–14), first the restoration of a people spiritually dead, and then their regeneration.<br />
We should notice the parallel in our own regeneration. There must be the word of the Lord (v. 4) and the Spirit (breath) of God (v. 9).</p>
<p><strong>The Reunification of Israel and Judah (37:15–28)<br />
</strong>Ezekiel was next commanded to take two sticks, one representing Judah and the other Israel (Joseph or Ephraim). By holding them end to end, he joined them into one stick. This meant that the two kingdoms, torn apart in the days of Rehoboam, would be reunited. One king (the Messiah) would reign over them, and they would be saved, cleansed, and restored.</p>
<p>David (here the Lord Jesus) would be the king, and the people would obey Him implicitly. God would make an everlasting covenant of peace with them, and the temple would be set in their midst. This is still future.</p>
<p><strong>Lesson 10:   Chapters  38 –  39</strong></p>
<p>The first battle of Gog and Magog.  As near as I can figure it, this battle takes place at or near the beginning of the “seventieth week” of Daniel.  Notice which nation is missing from the list of Middle Eastern nations that will attack Israel.<br />
2 “Son of man, set your face against Gog, of the land of Magog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 3 and say, ‘Thus says the Lord GOD: “Behold, I am against you, O Gog, the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal. 4 I will turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and lead you out, with all your army, horses, and horsemen, all splendidly clothed, a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords. 5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with them, all of them with shield and helmet; 6 Gomer and all its troops; the house of Togarmah from the far north and all its troops—many people are with you.</p>
<p>Gog – a ruler (possibly his name, or title)<br />
Magog – a land that includes Mesheck and Tubal, (which are in Turkey)<br />
Persia – Iran<br />
Ethiopia – North Africa<br />
Libya – west of Israel along the north African coast<br />
Gomer – Southern Ukraine, slightly north of Istambul<br />
Togarmah – Western Armenian region</p>
<p>The phrases “After many days” and “in the latter years” very clearly project the events to the distant future of Israel’s last days before the Second Coming.</p>
<p>What could possibly justify such an all-out military effort by the Muslim confederacy that is described here? The text says “To take a spoil”.  The Arab nations despise Israel and call for her destruction.  Also, although they have tremendous oil wealth, their agricultural and other natural resources are somewhat scarce.  The development of Israel since 1948 has been phenomenal. It is also a known fact that the mineral wealth in the Dead Sea is of almost incalculable value! Much of it is used for production of fertilizer.  Israel also stands at a crossroads of world commerce. Whoever controls Israel could control much more.</p>
<p>The greatest military power in the world will not be able to stand when God lets loose His fury by causing mountains, valleys, and buildings to be leveled. Added to this will be inundating floods, fire and brimstone through volcanic eruptions, and even confusion in the troops taking each other’s lives, perhaps as an escape from the holocaust of the elements. Thus, God will be magnified, because it will be recognized that the Lord has done this.</p>
<p>The destruction of the great army will be almost total. The text states that but one-sixth will survive. However, scholars are not agreed on the meaning of the original construction. The bows and arrows may, without difficulty, be viewed as figurative of weapons of warfare of whatever kind they may be. Even the land of Magog, where many of the troops come from, will experience the wrath of fire from the Lord upon them.</p>
<p>To clean up a carnage of this magnitude, supernatural aid is required. Many, of course, will have had their permanent burial through the leveling of mountains and valleys. The ravenous beasts and birds of prey will clean off the flesh. While Israel is burying the skeletons and bones, seven months will transpire. All the people of the land will be involved in the clean-up. It has been estimated that if an individual buried two bodies a day the total may have been in the millions.<br />
This gruesome task would appear to have a very sobering influence spiritually. No doubt it will prove to be one of the means of leading Israel, as well as the Gentiles, toward repentance and faith in the Lord.</p>
<p>Details of God’s purpose in His dealings with Israel are listed in the outline of chapter 39:21-29.   They are: to show His glory among the nations in verse 21; a deliverance from the king of the north in verse 22; the nations observing God’s purpose of chastening Israel in verses 23–24; then the nations observing Israel’s re-gathering in verses 25–28; and the regeneration of Israel in verse 29. It should be noted that Israel will be saved by God’s mercy, not by their merit; for the Lord will re-gather Israel for His name’s sake. The re-gathering of Israel will be one of the great demonstrations of God’s power.  As Israel’s deliverance from Egypt was in the past, and the resurrection of Christ from the grave is for the present, so Israel’s re-gathering and regeneration in the future will eternally magnify the Lord.<br />
Will Russia be involved in the military events of Ezekiel 38-39?  I believe that it is possible, in spite of the fact that the attacking nations are all Muslim dominated.  Russia has military sales and defense agreements with all of the nations listed in chapter 38, and so could easily be “dragged” into the conflict.  Also, there are several other reasons that could prompt Russia to get involved:</p>
<p>1. Russia needs a warm-water entrance into the waterways of the world. Israel offers that, and Russia is moving in this direction. They are looking for a warm-water port. Admiral Sergei Gorshkov made this statement, “The flag of the Soviet navy now proudly flies over the oceans of the world. Sooner or later the United States will have to understand that it no longer has mastery of the seas.” Russia is looking for a warm-water port. Where are they going? All I know is that they are headed for the Mediterranean Sea. What nation along the east side of the Mediterranean would be suitable as a port? Israel certainly would be. Russia is interested in moving southward today.<br />
2. God has a second hook—oil. The oil deposits of the Near East are essential for the survival of modern nations. Russia needs oil. Today we are being constantly reminded that the world is running short of energy. Oil is one of the resources in short supply. As a result, the world is turning to the places where they can get oil. There is oil in the Near East. Whether or not the oil is actually in the land of Israel is not the important thing. The important consideration is that, in spite of the strained relations between the Arabs and the Jews, a great deal of that oil is going through the land of Israel. When ships were not able to go through the Suez Canal, they put the oil off at a port which had been taken by Israel, and then the oil was taken across the land of Israel to the Mediterranean ports.<br />
3. The third hook concerns the Dead Sea. The mineral deposits in the Dead Sea are so great that they cannot be evaluated on today’s market. Chemicals saturated in the water represent untold wealth. It is estimated that the Dead Sea contains two billion tons of potassium chloride, which is potash—needed to sweeten and enrich the soil that is readily being depleted around the world, including our own area. The Dead Sea also contains twenty-two billion tons of magnesium chloride, twelve billion tons of sodium chloride, and six billion tons of calcium chloride. The Dead Sea, in addition to all of this, contains cerium, cobalt, manganese, and even gold. There is much effort being made today to extract this wealth from the Dead Sea.<br />
Lesson 11:   Chapters  40 –  48</p>
<p><strong>EZEKIEL’S VISION OF THE MILLENNIAL TEMPLE<br />
</strong>The Millennial Temple in Jerusalem (Chaps. 40–42)<br />
Commentator Paul Lee Tan writes: “Non-literal interpreters maintain that this prophecy is a symbol of the Christian church. However, this major prophecy in the Book of Ezekiel contains descriptions, specifications, and measurements of the millennial Temple which are so exhaustive that one may actually make a sketch of it, just as one might of Solomon’s historic temple.”</p>
<p><strong>1. The Man with the Measuring Rod (40:1–4)<br />
</strong>In the opening verses, Ezekiel is given a vision of the city of Jerusalem and the millennial temple. In the fourteenth year after Jerusalem was captured, Ezekiel was taken up in visions and set on a very high mountain. He was shown a vision of the city of Jerusalem and the millennial temple by a man whose appearance was like bronze. The prophet was commanded to fix his mind on everything he saw and to declare it to the house of Israel. This he does in the following chapters.</p>
<p><strong>2. The East Gate of the Outer Court (40:5–16)<br />
</strong>Since the temple was situated east and west, the natural entrance was the east gate, and with this gate the architectural description begins. First, the wall all around the outside of the temple is measured (v. 5). Then the east gate of this outer court is described (vv. 6–16).</p>
<p><strong>3. The Outer Court (40:17–19)<br />
</strong>Facing the pavement, which may well be a mosaic, as in 2 Chronicles 7:3 and Esther 1:6, there are to be thirty chambers.</p>
<p><strong>4. The Other Two Gates of the Outer Court (40:20–27)<br />
</strong>The gateway facing north is to be like the eastern one, with its archways and its palm trees. The gateway facing south had the same measurements and structure. There is no gateway facing west.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Three Gates to the Inner Court (40:28–37)<br />
</strong>The inner court also has three gateways: the southern gateway (vv. 28–31); a second gateway facing east (vv. 32–34); and a north gateway (vv. 35–37).</p>
<p><strong>6. The Equipment for Sacrifice (40:38–43)<br />
</strong>Eight tables at the vestibule will be provided at the north gateway for animal sacrifices. Also, four tables of hewn stone will be used for burnt offering. Both instruments for slaughtering the sacrifices and also hooks fastened all around will be provided.</p>
<p><strong>7. The Chambers for the Priests (40:44–47)<br />
</strong>Chambers will be provided for the singers, one set facing south and one facing north. The first is to be for the priests who have charge of the temple; the one facing north is for the priests who have charge of the altar (the sons of Zadok).</p>
<p><strong>8. The Vestibule of the Temple (40:48, 49)<br />
</strong>The vestibule or porch of the temple seems to be planned like the one in Solomon’s temple. The pillars remind us of the ones named Jachin and Boaz in that structure (1 Kgs. 7:21).</p>
<p>Chapter 40 deals primarily with the area surrounding the temple; chapter 41 describes the temple itself.<br />
The detailed measurements in chapters 40–43 remind us that in all our service we must build according to God’s specifications (see Ex. 25:40). Precise measurements also would seem to be meaningless unless this is to be a literal building.</p>
<p><strong>9. The Sanctuary and Most Holy Place (41:1–4)<br />
</strong>The measurements of the sanctuary are to be the same as in Solomon’s temple and twice as large as the tabernacle in the wilderness. The man with the appearance of bronze brought Ezekiel into the sanctuary, but he alone went into the Most Holy Place, reminding us of the ancient temple and tabernacle restrictions of entry (see Heb. 9:8, 12; 10:19). The same twofold division of the ancient temple apparently will be continued in the millennial temple.</p>
<p><strong>10. The Side Chambers (41:5–11)<br />
</strong>The temple will be very massive and spacious; it will have three stories with thirty chambers in each story. They will increase in size as one ascends, probably by going deeper into the main structure in stair-like fashion (v. 7).</p>
<p><strong>11. A Building West of the Temple (41:12)<br />
</strong>Facing the western end of the temple complex is a separate building seventy by ninety cubits. The purpose of this structure is not given.</p>
<p><strong>12. The Measurements of the Temple (41:13–15a)<br />
</strong>Ezekiel’s guide to the temple measured it at one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits wide.</p>
<p><strong>13. The Interior Decoration and Furnishing of the Temple (41:15b–26)<br />
</strong>The interior of the temple is to have galleries on both sides, doorposts, and beveled window frames.  Cherubim and palm trees will be the decorations, alternating all around the building. The cherubim, which speak of God’s holiness (see Genesis 3), have the face of a young lion toward one palm tree and the face of a man toward the other palm tree. Palm trees are symbolic of victory and righteousness in Scripture.  The altar, which is to be made of wood, is called by Ezekiel’s guide “the table that is before the LORD.”  The temple is to have two doors of two panels each, also carved with cherubim and palm trees.  The vestibule outside will be covered with a wooden canopy.  No mention is made of any veil, ark, or high priest. The veil was split apart at Calvary. The symbolism of the ark is fulfilled in Christ. And He is there as Great High Priest.</p>
<p><strong>14. The Priests’ Quarters (42:1–14)<br />
</strong>The priests will have quarters located both north and south of the temple. These areas will be where the priests will eat the most holy offerings, and in which they will keep their sacred garments for ministering.</p>
<p><strong>15. The Measurements of the Outer Court (42:15–20)<br />
</strong>The measurements of the outer court are to be five hundred rods on each of its four sides. The distinction between holy and common in verse 20 is the difference between what we might call sacred and secular. It is the difference between worship and the common affairs of everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>The Millennial Worship (Chaps. 43, 44)</strong><br />
Earlier in the Book of Ezekiel (11:23) we saw the glory cloud reluctantly leaving the temple at Jerusalem. But the glory of the God of Israel will return in the Person of the Lord Jesus when He comes to reign.  He will dwell forever in the midst of His people; no more will they practice spiritual harlotry (idolatry) and related abominations in the shadow of the temple.</p>
<p>When the House of Israel is ashamed of all that they have done, they will see the pattern, design, and arrangement of the new temple. As soon as they repent, God will give them new hope.  The people were to be told that the whole area surrounding the mountaintop on which the temple would be built would be most holy.  A true sight of the glory of the Lord makes us ashamed of our iniquities (v. 10).</p>
<p>The measurements of the altar, apparently like a terraced platform, are given next. The altar hearth is the surface of the altar, where the fire is built. It will have four horns extending upward from the hearth. An unusual feature of this altar is the fact that it has steps leading up to it; this was banned in the previous temples. This one will be so high that it will need a way to mount up to the top.</p>
<p>Next is given the ritual to be followed in consecrating the altar by blood. This will take seven days, and its importance in Israel’s public worship can be seen in several OT texts: Exodus 29:37; Leviticus 8:11, 15, 19, 33; 1 Kings 8:62–65; and 2 Chronicles 7:4–10. After all these rites, on the eighth day, the regular offerings will begin.</p>
<p>The chapter ends on an encouraging note: not only would God accept the people’s offerings, but, “I will accept you,” says the Lord GOD.<br />
Note that the priests in that day will be the sons of Zadok (v. 19), an honor probably stemming from Zadok’s unwavering loyalty to David and Solomon.</p>
<p><strong>In Chapter 44 we see:<br />
</strong>The east gate of the outer court must be permanently shut because once the LORD returns to the temple, He will never leave. Only the prince could sit in the vestibule of the gate and eat the sacrificial meal there. Some think that the prince is the Messiah Himself, others that he is a descendant of David who will serve as a vice-regent under Christ, the King. However, commentator F. W. Grant points out that he cannot be the Messiah because he has sons (46:16) and he offers a sin offering for himself (45:22).</p>
<p>When the Lord brought Ezekiel to the front of the temple, the prophet was awestruck by the glory of the LORD as it filled the house. Verse 4 should create a passionate desire for worship meetings where the glory of the Lord is so manifest that the worshipers are prostrate before Him.  The Lord instructed him to pay close attention to the new ordinances concerning the temple, its entrance and exits (v. 5), and to warn the people that the use of any foreigner in the service of the temple must cease (vv. 6–9).</p>
<p>Henceforth, the menial work would be assigned to the Levites, who had once fallen into idolatry. Only the sons of Zadok could serve as priests, drawing near and ministering to God. The sons of Zadok were faithful in the times of trouble under David (2 Sam. 15:24; 1 Kgs. 1:32 etc.; 2:26, 27, 35). The Levites might be suspended from priestly service because of the curse on Eli’s family or because of unfaithfulness during the times of the kings. We learn from all this that sin often has bitter consequences, and that faithfulness will be rewarded.</p>
<p>The priests would be required to wear linen garments, not woolen. The expression “in their holy garments they shall not sanctify the people” (v. 19b) refers to a ritual holiness reserved only for the service of the sanctuary and not for the priests’ regular duties (Ex. 29:37; 30:29; Lev. 6:18, 27; Hag. 2:10–12).<br />
Regulations are given concerning well-trimmed haircuts, restrictions on wine, and suitable marriages for the priests.</p>
<p>The sons of Zadok would also serve as teachers and judges, making God’s people discern between what is holy and clean on the one hand, and unholy and unclean on the other.<br />
They will be supported by things dedicated to the Lord. The Lord wants to be their inheritance, and they will have nothing on earth. This is true for the servants of God today; He wants us to find our full satisfaction in Him, and thus be free to serve unhindered by worldly attachments. Like Paul we can learn to be content in every state (Phil. 4:11), but we do have to learn it because it does not come naturally to anyone. A broken man can say, “There is none upon earth that I desire besides You.  God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever” (Ps. 73:25, 26).</p>
<p><strong>The Millennial Administration (Chaps. 45, 46)<br />
</strong>In the center of the land of Israel, a piece of land will be set apart for the LORD as a holy district. It will be twenty-five thousand cubits by ten thousand. (A standard cubit is 18 inches. Thus the holy district will be 37,500 feet by 15,000 feet)  It will be divided into two strips. The top half will contain the sanctuary, and will also be for the priests. The lower half will be for the Levites.  At the bottom of the square will be a third strip, a common place, which will include the city of Jerusalem.  All the land to the east and west of this square, as far as the boundaries of the land, will belong to the prince.</p>
<p>The princes of Israel are to execute justice in their dealings (v. 9), using honest scales and measures.  In these verses, all the people are required to offer a certain percentage of their crops to the prince in Israel in order to provide for the regular offerings and appointed seasons.  On the first day of the first month, the sanctuary is to be cleansed, and on the seventh day of the same month, the people are to be cleansed of sins committed unintentionally or in ignorance.  The Passover is to be kept on the fourteenth day of the first month and the Feast of Tabernacles on the fifteenth day of the seventh month.  No mention is made of the Feast of Pentecost, the Feast of Trumpets, or the Day of Atonement.</p>
<p><strong>MILLENNIAL SACRIFICES<br />
</strong>In Ezekiel 43:20, 26; 45:15, 17 some of the offerings that will be presented during the Millennium are distinctly said to be for the purpose of making atonement. How can this be reconciled with Hebrews 10:12: “But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.” Or Hebrews 10:18: “Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin?”  As used in the OT, the word “atonement” (lit., covering) never means the putting away of sins. Hebrews 10:4 reminds us that “ &#8230; it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.” Rather the sacrifices were an annual reminder of sins (Heb. 10:3). What then did atonement mean? It meant that the sacrifices produced an outward, ceremonial cleanness. They conferred a ritual purification on people, enabling them to draw near as worshipers in fellowship with God. The sacrifices even made atonement for inanimate things, such as the altar (Ex. 29:37), where there could be no thought of remission of sins. All it means is that the altar was cleansed ceremonially and thus made fit for God’s service.  When we read of the forgiveness of unintentional sin in connection with atonement (Lev. 4:20), it can only mean the removal of ceremonial defilement so that the person could draw near in worship.</p>
<p>In our day the word “atonement” has acquired a much wider and deeper meaning. It is used, for instance, to describe the entire sacrificial work of Christ by which our sins are put away and we are reconciled to God. But it never has this meaning in the Bible. (In Rom. 5:11 KJV, the word “atonement” should be “reconciliation,” as in NKJV and other versions.)  The sacrifices in Israel’s history looked forward to the perfect and complete sacrifice of Christ. The sacrifices in the Millennium will commemorate His work on Calvary. They will be memorials for Israel just as the Lord’s Supper is.  The passages in Hebrews do not rule out any sacrificial ceremony in the future. But they insist that no future sacrifices can ever deal effectively with sins, any more than they did in the past.</p>
<p>Verses 1–8 tell how the prince is to stand in the east gate of the inner court to worship when he brings his offerings for the Feast of the Sabbath and of the New Moon (v. 6). He cannot enter the inner court. The people are to stand behind the prince and worship as the priests sacrifice. Neither the prince nor the people can enter the inner court.  In the Millennium, Israel will see Christ in the offerings, something the nation as a whole never did in the past.</p>
<p>The people are to leave the outer court by the opposite gate to which they entered. They were to follow the movements of the prince.  In verses 11 and 12, the prince’s freewill offerings are described; in verses 13–15, the daily sacrifices. Laws with respect to the prince’s property prevent him from losing it permanently or from adding to it unjustly.  Kitchens are provided for the priests and for the people.</p>
<p><strong>The Millennial Land (Chaps. 47, 48)<br />
1. The Healing of the Waters (47:1–12)<br />
</strong>Ezekiel saw in a vision a river flowing from the door of the temple, past the altar, through the wall south of the east Gate, and down to the Dead Sea. The waters of the sea will be healed, and fish will abound in it.  The water of life is a favorite figure in the Old Testament. Desert areas need water that life may be possible. This stream which Ezekiel sees flowing from the Temple makes its way toward the arid regions of the Arabah. In an ever deepening stream it goes on its way to bring life and health and abundant fruit wherever it goes. It is the one remedy that is needed. Jesus took that figure as a basis for his sermon to the woman at the well. (Cf. also Ps. 1:3; 46:4; Joel 3:18; Zech. 14:8; John 4:7–15; 7:38; Rev. 22:1, 2.)  This stream (which will be an actual geographical river) is a striking figure of the blessing, widespread yet incomplete (v. 11), that will flow out during the Millennial Reign of Christ. God will dwell in the temple and therefore a stream of blessing, ever increasing, will go forth to other places. Today God does dwell in our bodies (1 Cor. 6:19) and therefore a stream of blessing should be flowing to others around us (John 7:37, 38). “If a man is filled with the Holy Spirit, and his life touches other lives, something happens for God.” What a challenge for us to meet the conditions that will produce a blessing!  The river will bring life wherever it flows—a vivid picture of the life-giving ministry of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Boundaries of the Land (47:13–23)<br />
</strong>47:13–20 The future borders and divisions of the land are next given. The boundaries are described here.  Ezekiel’s mention of the Jordan River as a boundary of the land (v. 18) cannot be a mistake; he certainly knew that the land would stretch east to the Euphrates (Gen. 15:18). Here he may be referring to a preliminary occupation of Israel itself.  Within each tribal portion, the land will be divided by lot, according to the tribes of Israel, but strangers will not be excluded from an inheritance.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Division of the Land (Chap. 48)<br />
</strong>It seems that the land will be divided in horizontal strips, from the Mediterranean to the eastern boundary of the land. The northernmost strip will be for the tribe of Dan (v. 1). Then below that, for Asher (v. 2), for Naphtali (v. 3), for Manasseh (v. 4), for Ephraim (v. 5), for Reuben (v. 6), and for Judah (v. 7).</p>
<p>South of Judah will be the portion already assigned to the prince, and including the sanctuary and the city of Jerusalem. This “holy district” will be a large square area bordering on the northern part of the Dead Sea. It will be divided into three horizontal strips, the northernmost one belonging to the priests, and having the Millennial temple in its center. The middle strip will be for the Levites, and the southern strip for the common people, with Jerusalem in its center. The remaining territory east and west of the square will belong to the prince.</p>
<p>Then south of the holy district will be sections for the tribes of Benjamin (v. 23), Simeon (v. 24), Issachar (v. 25), Zebulun (v. 26), and Gad (v. 27).</p>
<p>The city of New Jerusalem will have twelve gates, three on each side, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel. Its name will be: Jehovah Shammah—THE LORD IS THERE.  This name reminds us of what was always in the heart of God: He loves His creatures so much that He always planned to have them close to Himself. He is ever searching, asking, “Where are you?”, calling to repentance and faith.<br />
Eight Items Missing From Ezekiel’s Temple</p>
<p>The Wall Of Partition – separating Gentiles from the inner areas of the Temple.</p>
<p>The Court Of The Women – keeping women from the closest areas of the Court of Israel.</p>
<p>These two are done away with according to Galatians 3:27-28</p>
<p>The Laver – for the washing of priests for ceremonial cleansing.<br />
See Titus 3:5</p>
<p>The Golden Menorah – to provide light in the Holy Place.<br />
See John 8:12</p>
<p>The Table Of Showbread – unleavened loaves representing the tribes of Israel, and the Manna God provided in the wilderness.<br />
See John 6:35</p>
<p>The Altar Of  Incense – to provide the sweet smelling savor to arise before the Lord, representing the prayers of the people as they seek for the Lord.<br />
See Ezekiel 48:35</p>
<p>The Veil That Separates -  to keep the Holy of Holies closed from the people.<br />
See Isaiah 25:7 and Mark 15:37-38</p>
<p>The Ark Of The Covenant – the residing place of the tablets of the Law, and the Mercy Seat, described as the footstool of God’s Throne.<br />
See Jeremiah 3:16-17 and Ezekiel 43:5-7</p>
<p><strong>Notes On Millennial Sacrifices</strong></p>
<p>“Some commentators hold that a reinstitution of sacrifices contradicts Hebrews<br />
8:8-13. Yes, we see sacrifices in the Millennial kingdom because the Bible<br />
prophecies this. We do realize there is no need for sacrifice for sin, however there are other sacrifices, and these sacrifices in the Millennium may be similar to the Lord’s Table in meaning. They may have commemorative value.<br />
The problem is that the objectors probably misinterpret Hebrews, and ignore that the prophecies always mention that the Millennial sacrifices are a<br />
memorial or some other form, rather than the sin sacrifices that are no<br />
longer needed.”<br />
From “Derrickson’s Notes On Theology”</p>
<p><strong>“MILLENNIAL SACRIFICES&#8221;<br />
</strong>In Ezekiel 43:20, 26; 45:15, 17 some of the offerings that will be presented during the Millennium are distinctly said to be for the purpose of making atonement. How can this be reconciled with Hebrews 10:12: “But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.” Or Hebrews 10:18: “Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin?”</p>
<p>As used in the OT, the word “atonement” (lit., covering) never means the putting away of sins. Hebrews 10:4 reminds us that “ &#8230; it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.” Rather the sacrifices were an annual reminder of sins (Heb. 10:3). What then did atonement mean? It meant that the sacrifices produced an outward, ceremonial cleanness. They conferred a ritual purification on people, enabling them to draw near as worshipers in fellowship with God. The sacrifices even made atonement for inanimate things, such as the altar (Ex. 29:37), where there could be no thought of remission of sins. All it means is that the altar was cleansed ceremonially and thus made fit for God’s service.</p>
<p>When we read of the forgiveness of unintentional sin in connection with atonement (Lev. 4:20), it can only mean the removal of ceremonial defilement so that the person could draw near in worship.  In our day the word “atonement” has acquired a much wider and deeper meaning. It is used, for instance, to describe the entire sacrificial work of Christ by which our sins are put away and we are reconciled to God. But it never has this meaning in the Bible. (In Rom. 5:11 KJV, the word “atonement” should be “reconciliation,” as in NKJV and other versions.)  The sacrifices in Israel’s history looked forward to the perfect and complete sacrifice of Christ. The sacrifices in the Millennium will commemorate His work on Calvary. They will be memorials for Israel just as the Lord’s Supper is for us.<br />
The passages in Hebrews do not rule out any sacrificial ceremony in the future. But they insist that no future sacrifices can ever deal effectively with sins, any more than they did in the past. “<br />
From “The Believer’s Bible Commentary”</p>
<p>“One feature of the millennial kingdom will be a rebuilt temple, complete with animal sacrifices. Since the Scriptures indicate that much typological significance of both the temple and its service has already been fulfilled by Christ, we might question the need for a temple or for animal sacrifice in the next dispensation. But the temple will (1) demonstrate God’s holiness; (2) provide a dwelling place for the glory of God; (3) perpetuate a memorial of sacrifice; (4) become a center for divine government; and (5) assure victory over the curse. Illustration: The sacrifices in the Millennium will be memorial, much as the observance of the Lord’s Supper is memorial today. When both practices were instituted, they were pointing typologically to the atoning death of Christ. At no time did the sacrifices or the Lord’s Supper have atoning value, though the atonement message is central to their symbolism. When practiced after the Cross, both can have only a memorial significance. Application: As the believer confesses his sin (1 John 1:9) God will forgive and cleanse. (First Reference, Ezek. 47:1–12; Primary Reference, Ezek. 47:1–12; cf. Rev. 20:12.)</p>
<p>The mention of the burnt offering here and in connection with the altar (43:13–27) has proved problematic. Under the new covenant, Jesus Christ “after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God” (Heb. 10:12). How then may one explain this seeming reversion to the Levitical system of bloody sacrifices? Some have suggested that Ezekiel is merely presenting the worship of the Millennium in terms familiar to himself and his readers. Others have pointed out that several good reasons for the use of animal sacrifices can be given. Even the Levitical sacrifices did not take away sin, but were only pictures of Christ’s work prior to its accomplishment. There is no reason that the millennial sacrifices cannot have the status of memorials to the work of Christ, just as the Old Testament sacrifices had their status as precursors of Christ’s work. In the early New Testament church Christian Jews sometimes observed the temple worship (Acts 2:46; 3:1; 5:42) even to the point of offering sacrifices (Acts 21:26). Certainly they knew that these sacrifices added nothing to the work of Christ, but only pictured it. “<br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong> LESSON 1:  Islam</strong><br />
Approximately one-sixth of the world’s population, are Moslems. The founder of the religion is Mohammed, who, according to Moslems, was the greatest of all the prophets.  Mohammed was born in A.D. 570 in Mecca. His early years were relatively uneventful as a manager of camel caravans and a keeper of his wife’s estate.<span id="more-1203"></span> However, one evening in a cave on Mt. Hira, where he often went to pray, he is said to have heard a loud voice telling him to “read.”  Protesting that he could not read, he heard the voice command him again. He was then shown a scroll on which words were emblazoned with fire. Although he had never previously read a word, Mohammed miraculously read the scroll.  He left the cave fearing that he had gone mad, but he heard the voice again. Looking up, Mohammed saw in human form the angel Gabriel, who said to him, “Oh Mohammed! You are Allah’s messenger, and I am Gabriel.”  This did not yet convince him, the story goes. Later he received another call, which he obeyed. His mission as an apostle of God was to proclaim to his idolatrous people a pure monotheism.<br />
At the outset, his message met with great resistance, which included persecution and exile from his own people. He claimed to receive further revelations from Allah, which proclaimed himself as successor of the prophets, including Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. Mohammed eventually viewed himself as the final messenger Allah would send to the world, making him the prophet.</p>
<p>In A.D. 622, a group of 150 Moslems left Mecca secretly for the town of Yathrib. Mohammed journeyed to Yathrib later that year, on September 20, the date which begins the Moslem calendar. The city was later renamed Medina in honor of Mohammed’s eight-year residence there.  At sixty years of age, Mohammed and his army marched upon Mecca in an attempt to claim this as the Holy City of Islam, eventually conquering it against overwhelming odds. Two years later the prophet of Allah died.  The pattern had been set for the followers of Mohammed. The enemies of Allah must be overthrown. Islam quickly spread beyond the Arabian borders, capturing Jerusalem by A.D. 636.  By 715, the empire had spread from the Chinese frontier westward to the Atlantic Ocean. Thus Islam began its quest to follow the principles of Allah, and has subsequently grown into one of the world’s major religions.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY OF BELIEFS AND PRACTICES:<br />
</strong>Founded by Mohammed (A.D. 570 – 632), who is the “final seal” of many prophets sent by Allah.  The Islamic calendar begins in A.D. 622, when Mohammed fled Mecca.  There are 2 main “sects” of Islam; the Sunni, and the Shi’ite.  The Koran was revealed to Mohammed by the angel Gabriel and is considered authoritative.  The biblical Law of Moses, Psalms of David, and Gospel of Jesus are accepted, but Muslims are taught that the Jews and Christians have corrupted and misinterpreted these revelations.</p>
<p>Allah is ONE, and the greatest sin in Islam is called “shir’k”, and means to “associate” anything with God.  Muslims believe that Christians accept 3 gods, and believe that we have committed “shir’k” because we say that Jesus is God’s (to them, Allah) Son.  ANY human attribute such as fatherhood cannot be associated with Allah.</p>
<p>Jesus (in Arabic, “Isa”) is one of the most respected of over 124,000 prophets sent to mankind by Allah.  They say that he is sinless, born of a virgin, and worked miracles; but that he IS NOT the son of God, because God has NO son.  Jesus was created in Mary’s womb in the same manner that Adam was created.  Jesus WAS NOT crucified.</p>
<p>Humans are basically good, but fallible and in need of guidance.  The balance between good and bad deeds (works) determines your eternal destiny in paradise or hell.  Allah’s mercy may tip the scales to heaven, since his will is supreme.  Muslim’s believe in a hell of eternal torment.  Paradise includes luscious gardens populated by “houris”, maidens designed by Allah to provide sexual pleasures to righteous men.</p>
<p>Muslim practices include:  Holy efforts to spread Islam (by force if necessary) called “jihad”;  Active confession that Allah is the one true god, and that Mohammed is his prophet;  Praying five times a day while facing the city of Mecca;  Giving alms (money) to the poor;  Fast during the month of Ramadan (daylight fast);  Make a pilgrimage to Mecca once during your life.</p>
<p><strong>WHO IS “ALLAH”?<br />
</strong>Scholars agree that “Allah”, although being the Arabic word that means “god”, just as the word “El” does in Hebrew, was an actual pagan deity that was part of the middle-eastern pantheon at the time of Mohammed.  This god “Allah” was a moon god, and was one of the primary gods worshipped in the area where Mohammed lived.  Mohammed elevated this “moon god” to the level of supreme god and declared him to be THE god, and that there was no other.  Allah is a God of infinite power and wisdom, not a God of redeeming love to all mankind; a despotic sovereign of trembling subjects and slaves, not a loving Father of trustful children. He is an object of reverence and fear rather than of love and gratitude. He is the God of fate who has unalterably foreordained all things evil as well as good; hence unconditional resignation to him (this is the meaning of Islâm) is true wisdom and piety.</p>
<p><strong>COMPARISON TO CHRISTIANITY:<br />
</strong>As with all world religions, there are tremendous differences between biblical Christianity and Islam. A close examination of the two faiths will find their beliefs to be incompatible.</p>
<p>Mohammed claimed that the revelations given him by God were infallible, thus making the Quran the standard by which the other Scriptures are to be tested. However, the mere claim to revelations is meaningless unless backed up by some kind of adequate evidence.  The evidence for the inspiration and historical reliability of the Bible is overwhelming, while evidence for the infallibility of the Quran is lacking.</p>
<p>Mohammed also asserted that the Gospel portrait of Jesus is incorrect, while the proper view was revealed to him by God. The Moslem thus believes the report in the Quran of the life of Jesus, rather than the New Testament account. The Jesus who is revealed in the Quran is not the same Jesus who is portrayed in the Gospels. Both accounts cannot be true at the same time. The Quran is in direct conflict with the Scriptures on the character of Jesus Christ. “Jesus Christ, the son of Mary, was no more than an apostle of God” (Sura 19:92). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the Quran states that Jesus is a prophet only to the nation Israel, while Mohammed is the last and greatest prophet to the whole world.<br />
Contrast that with the biblical view of Jesus Christ, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God” (John 1:1), “He who has seen me has seen the Father” (John 14:9), “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (Matthew 16:16), “And He is the radiance of His glory and the exact representation of His nature, and upholds all things by the word of His power. When He had made purification of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high” (Hebrews 1:3).</p>
<p>The Quran, speaking of the death of Christ, states, “They neither killed nor crucified him; it had only the appearance of it.”  The New Testament, however, makes the mode of Jesus’ death very clear: “And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him” (Luke 23:33), “and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into Thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost” (Luke 23:46).</p>
<p>The Bible teaches that Jesus was the virgin-born Son of Mary, God in human flesh. “And the angel said to her, ‘Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus’” (Luke 1:30-31); “And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore that holy Offspring will be called the Son of God’” (Luke 1:35).  Islam teaches that Jesus was born miraculously from Mary but they do not believe in the biblical virgin birth. They believe that, as Adam was created from the earth, Jesus was created by God in the womb of Mary. They say He is not a god or the Son of God. Although this would be a miraculous conception, it is not the same as the biblical virgin birth.</p>
<p>Islam also teaches salvation by works: “They whose balances shall be heavy shall be blest. But they whose balances shall be light, they shall lose their soul, abiding in hell forever” (Sura 13:102–140). Thus if the scale tips in favor of good works, the Moslem will reach paradise, but if this be not the case then he will be banished to hell.  The Bible teaches a salvation by grace through faith and not of works. “For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast” (Ephesians 2:8-9), “Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us” (Titus 3:5).</p>
<p><strong>QUOTATIONS FROM THE KORAN:<br />
</strong>&#8220;2.111&#8243;:    And they say: None shall enter the garden (or paradise) except he who is a Jew or a Christian. These are their vain desires. Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful.<br />
&#8220;2.112&#8243;:    Yes! whoever submits himself entirely to Allah and he is the doer of good (to others) he has his reward from his Lord, and there is no fear for him nor shall he grieve.<br />
&#8220;2.113&#8243;:    And the Jews say: The Christians do not follow anything (good) and the Christians say: The Jews do not follow anything (good) while they recite the (same) Book. Even thus say those who have no knowledge, like to what they say; so Allah shall judge between them on the day of resurrection in what they differ.</p>
<p>&#8220;3.45&#8243;:    When the angels said: O Marium, surely Allah gives you good news with a Word from Him (of one) whose name is the Messiah, Isa son of Marium, worthy of regard in this world and the hereafter and of those who are made near (to Allah).<br />
&#8220;3.46&#8243;:    And he shall speak to the people when in the cradle and when of old age, and (he shall be) one of the good ones.</p>
<p>&#8220;3.47&#8243;:    She said: My Lord! when shall there be a son (born) to I me, and man has not touched me? He said: Even so, Allah creates what He pleases; when He has decreed a matter, He only says to it, Be, and it is.<br />
&#8220;3.48&#8243;:    And He will teach him the Book and the wisdom and the Tavrat and the Injeel.<br />
&#8220;3.49&#8243;:    And (make him) an apostle to the children of Israel: That I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, that I determine for you out of dust like the form of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird with Allah&#8217;s permission and I heal the blind and the leprous, and bring the dead to life with Allah&#8217;s permission and I inform you of what you should eat and what you should store in your houses; most surely there is a sign in this for you, if you are believers.</p>
<p>&#8220;3.59&#8243;:    Surely the likeness of Isa is with Allah as the likeness of Adam; He created him from dust, then said to him, Be, and he was.<br />
&#8220;3.60&#8243;:    (This is) the truth from your Lord, so be not of the disputers.</p>
<p>&#8220;3.84&#8243;:    Say: We believe in Allah and what has been revealed to us, and what was revealed to Ibrahim and Ismail and Ishaq and Yaqoub and the tribes, and what was given to Musa and Isa and to the prophets from their Lord; we do not make any distinction between any of them, and to Him do we submit.<br />
&#8220;The Unity&#8221;<br />
In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.<br />
&#8220;112.1&#8243;:    Say: He, Allah, is One.<br />
&#8220;112.2&#8243;:    Allah is He on Whom all depend.<br />
&#8220;112.3&#8243;:    He begets not, nor is He begotten.<br />
&#8220;112.4&#8243;:    And none is like Him.</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 2:  Mormonism<br />
</strong>Just as the Islamic Prophet Mohammed wrote his “book” by angelic visitation, so Joseph Smith, the founder of the Mormon church wrote “The Book of Mormon” under the guidance of an “angel” named Moroni.   He is said to have experienced a conversion at the age of 15 and subsequently to have received a direct revelation from God engraved on golden plates. He translated and published the contents of these tablets as the Book of Mormon in 1830. He followed it up with A Book of Commandments in 1833 (later republished as Doctrine and Covenants in 1835). Both these books form the scriptures of the Mormon Church. He claimed divine sanction for his own polygamy, which so incensed his neighbors in Carthage, Illinois, that he was killed by a mob in the local jail in 1844.</p>
<p>“Mormons” is the popular name for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints founded in Manchester, New York, in 1830.  In 1843 Smith received a further revelation sanctioning polygamy and permitting the president of the church to receive further revelations for the guidance of the church as a whole. By thus adding to the Bible unauthenticated books and revelations, the Mormons have placed themselves outside orthodox Christianity and acquired the characteristics of a cult.</p>
<p>Mormon doctrines differ from Biblical Christianity in many key areas, teaching:<br />
1. God is not merely spiritual, but also physical.<br />
2. There are thousands of gods in some ill-defined order of progression.<br />
3. All gods were once men and all men may become gods.<br />
4. Human beings existed as spirits before being born. Pre-existence is a probationary stage and those who fail the probative stage are born as blacks.<br />
5. Adam’s fall was a good thing because otherwise there would be no human race.<br />
6. Christ is divine but only in the sense that all men are divine.<br />
7. Resurrection is a right earned by Christ for all Mormons.<br />
8. Justification is not by faith but by good works and through belief in Joseph Smith.<br />
9. The Mormon Church is the only true church in Christian history.<br />
10. Baptism by immersion is essential for salvation.<br />
11. The Lord’s Supper is administered weekly but water is substituted                                                          <br />
          for wine.<br />
12. Christ will reign over the earth in a literal millennium from two                <br />
         capitals: Jerusalem and Independence, Missouri.<br />
13. Hell is a place where the devil, his angels, and nonbelievers will be            <br />
         consigned.<br />
14. The dead may receive baptism and absolution for their sins.<br />
15. There are three heavenly kingdoms: celestial, terrestrial, and                                                       <br />
          telestial.</p>
<p>Mormons put great emphasis on missionary work, which explains their phenomenal growth in recent years. Each member is expected to tithe strictly and to devote some time to proselytization. Local churches are called wards, but ceremonies, such as marriages and baptisms for the dead, can be performed only in temples. There are a few breakaway groups in the United States, the largest being the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, headquartered in Independence, Missouri.  The Mormons have long endeavored to make themselves more clearly understood by other churches. They want to be seen as just another Christian group. To achieve this goal they even added a new twist to the Book of Mormon, calling it The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ.  Those who clearly understand Mormonism know that it is a spiritual nightshade, deadly to the soul. Its theology contradicts New Testament teaching. As long as Mormons claim that Joseph Smith had a revelation beyond New Testament teaching, they remain a cult and stand outside historical Christianity.</p>
<p><strong>THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MORMONISM, WHICH MAKE IT WHAT IT IS<br />
</strong>1. It is a strongly anti-freedom system. By that is meant that it flatly contradicts the fundamental principles of our free, representative government, by insisting that priesthood government in civil affairs is the only rightful government in this country, or any country. Apostle Orson Pratt, speaking for the Mormon Church, thus lays down the law: “The kingdom of God (by which he means the Mormon priesthood) is an order of government established by Divine authority &#8230;. All<br />
other governments are illegal and unauthorized &#8230;. Any people attempting to govern themselves by laws of their own making, and by officers of their own appointment, are in direct rebellion against the kingdom of God”. (Orson Pratt’s Works, p. 41).<br />
One of the official books of the church thus sets forth this extravagant and blasphemous claim: “Men who hold the priesthood possess Divine authority thus to act for God; and by possessing part of God’s power, they are in reality<br />
part of God; … and those who reject it, reject God. even the power of God”. (“New Witness for God,” p. 187).</p>
<p>2. The Mormon System is thoroughly anti-Christian. While appropriating<br />
to itself Christian phraseology, and New Testament names and forms, it<br />
perverts or denies every fundamental doctrine of the Christian religion. It<br />
not only denies but ridicules the Christian doctrine of the spirituality of<br />
God, and teaches the people that He is a big man like Brigham Young.<br />
Mormonism teaches that Adam is the god of this world. It denies that<br />
Christ’s atonement has anything to do with our sins, but only with the sins<br />
of Adam. To get rid of our sins, we must work out our salvation through<br />
the teachings, and forms, and ordinances of the Mormon Church.</p>
<p>3. Mormonism is a deliberate counterfeit of the Christian religion, intended<br />
to deceive the ignorant. It calls itself, “The Church of Jesus Christ”, a name<br />
to which it can lay no claim. The term “Church” is a Christian name and<br />
belongs alone to Christians — to those who are loyal to the Christian<br />
Church, to Jesus Christ as the Divine and only head of the Church, and to<br />
the Bible as the supreme and only revelation from God.</p>
<p><strong>THE DOCTRINES OF THE MORMON SYSTEM<br />
</strong>In the Spring of 1844, when the Mormon Church was being severely<br />
condemned all over the country, John Wentworth, who was publishing a<br />
paper in Chicago, asked Joseph Smith to state what the Mormons believe.<br />
Smith and some of his associates put their heads together, and sent out<br />
thirteen articles as a summary of Mormon belief. Let us take up the first six or seven of these pretended articles of belief, and see how misleading they are.<br />
“<strong>Article 1.</strong></p>
<p>We Believe In God The Eternal Father, And In His Son Jesus<br />
Christ, And In The Holy Ghost.”<br />
1. By God the eternal Father, the Mormon officials mean Adam. (For convenience we will use the following abbreviations: B. of M. for Book of<br />
Mormon; D. &amp; C. for Doctrine and Covenants; P. G. P. for Pearl of Great<br />
Price; Comp. for Compendium of Mormon Doctrine; Key, for Pratt’s Key<br />
to Theol.; J. of D. for Journal of Discourses — volumes of Mormon Sermons; and M. C. for Mormon Catechism). Brigham Young taught that Adam was promoted to be the god of this world: “He (Adam) is our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do”. (J. of D., Vol. I, p. 50).<br />
2. This Adam-god is a polygamist.  “When our Father Adam came into the garden of Eden, he came into it with a celestial body, and brought Eve, one of his wives, with him”. (Brigham Young, J. of D., I, 50).<br />
3. The Mormon officials teach that those who build up large polygamous<br />
establishments on earth, will be promoted to be gods in the heavenly world,<br />
and will rule over kingdoms. Take this heathen teaching of Joseph Smith:<br />
“God Himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted Man (in other words, simply a big Mormon) &#8230;. And you have got to learn how to be gods yourselves, the same as all gods have done before you”. (J. of D., VI, 4; Comp. 283).<br />
4. It will be seen that Mormonism believes in many gods. “Are there more gods than one? Yes, many”. (Catechism).<br />
5. These gods continue to have. children forever. “Each god, through his wife or wives, raises up a numerous family of sons and daughters, … for each father and mother will be in a condition to multiply forever and ever”. (The Seer, 1, 37).<br />
This is directly contrary to our Savior’s teaching in Mark 12:25: “For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven”.<br />
6. They teach that the Holy Spirit is a kind of ethereal substance diffused through space.  “The purest, most refined and subtle of all these substances (such as electricity, galvanism, magnetism) &#8230; is that substance called the<br />
Holy Spirit”. (Key, p. 39).</p>
<p><strong>“Article 2.</strong></p>
<p>We Believe That Men Will Be Punished For Their Own Sins, And Not For Adam’s Transgressions.” But that is very different from holding that Adam did not transgress the law of God. Here is the teaching of the Mormon Catechism: “Was it necessary that Adam should partake of the forbidden fruit? Yes, unless he had done so, he would not have known good and evil here, neither could he have had mortal posterity”.  “Is it proper for us to consider the transgression of Adam and Eve as a grievous calamity, and that all mankind would have been infinitely more happy if the Fall had not occurred? No, but we ought to consider the Fall of our first parents as one of the great steps to eternal exaltation and  happiness”. (Catechism, Chapter 8).</p>
<p><strong>“Article 3. </strong></p>
<p>We Believe That Through The Atonement Of Jesus Christ All Mankind May Be Saved, By Obedience To The Laws And Ordinances Of The Gospel”.<br />
1. That is, the bogus Mormon Gospel. According to the official teachings of Mormonism, who was Jesus Christ? The son of Adam-god and Mary. “The Father has begotten him in his own likeness. He was not begotten of the Holy Ghost. And who is the Father? He is the first of the human family”. (Brigham Young, J. of D., I, 50).<br />
2. Christ is represented as having plural wives. “We say it was Jesus Christ who was married (at Cana to the Mary’s and Martha), whereby He could see His seed before He was crucified” (Apostle O. Hyde, Sermon).  “The atonement made by Jesus Christ brought about the resurrection from the dead, and restored life”. (B. of M. Alma, 42:23).<br />
“Redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirements of the Gospel [Mormon ceremonies] and a life of good works”. “Will all the people be damned who are not Latter-Day Saints? Yes, and a great many of them except they repent speedily”. (Brigham Young, J. of D., I, 339).</p>
<p><strong>“Article 4.</strong></p>
<p> We Believe That The First Principles And Ordinances Of The Bible Are:<br />
First, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; Second Repentance; Third, Baptism by Immersion for the Remission of Sins; Fourth, Laying on of Hands for the Gift of the Holy Ghost.”<br />
1. “The sectarian doctrine of justification by faith alone has exercised an influence for evil since the early days of Christianity”. (Talmage’s Articles of Faith, p. 120).<br />
2. How to obtain the Holy Spirit: “There is a set mode by which this great gift (the Holy Spirit) is conferred upon mankind &#8230; the laying on of hands by men who have themselves received it, and have been called of God and ordained to administer it”. (That means the Mormon priesthood).</p>
<p><strong>“Article 5.</strong></p>
<p>We Believe That A Man Must Be Called Of God By Prophecy, And By The Laying On Of Hands, By Those Who Are In Authority, To Preach The Gospel And Administer In The Ordinances Thereof.”<br />
According to Mormonism, the only persons who have any right to administer the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are the representatives of the Mormon priesthood. It unchurches all the Christian denominations, and impudently claims that the Mormon Church is the only true church; whereas it is not a church at all in the New Testament sense.  Its priesthood is bogus in its origin and its authority. They are what our Savior calls “thieves and robbers”.</p>
<p><strong>“Article 6. </strong></p>
<p>We Believe In The Same Organization That Existed In The<br />
Primitive Church; Namely, Apostles, Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, Evangelists, Etc.”<br />
There is no warrant in the New Testament for such bogus officials as the<br />
“First Presidency of the Church”, with its two Counsellors, or for the “High Council”, with its despotic methods.  The Mormon Church pronounces damnation upon Christian believers who receive baptism from the hands of Christian ministers.  “Any person who shall be so wicked as to receive a holy ordinance of the Gospel from the ministers of these apostate (Christian)<br />
churches, will be sent down to hell with them unless he repents of the unholy and impious act”. (The Seer, Vols. 1 and 2, p. 255).</p>
<p><strong>“Article 7.</strong></p>
<p>We Believe In The Gift Of Tongues, Prophecy, Visions, Healing,<br />
Interpretation Of Tongues.”<br />
“Article 8. We Believe The Bible To Be The Word Of God, So Far As It Is<br />
Correctly Translated; We Also Believe The Book Of Mormon To Be The Word Of God.”<br />
The priesthood can make additional Scriptures: “Wilford Woodruff is a prophet, &#8230; and he can make Scriptures as good as those in the Bible”. (Apostle J. W. Taylor, Conference, Salt Lake, April 5, 1897).<br />
“The living oracles [pretended priestly revelations] are worth more to the Latter-Day Saints than all the Bibles” &#8230;. (Apostle M. W. Merrill, Conference, Salt Lake, Oct., 1897).</p>
<p>The disgusting doctrine of plural marriage is omitted from these Articles of<br />
Faith. But it still Stands in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants as a revelation from God to be observed under pain of eternal damnation. Yet as Mrs. Orson Pratt said: “This pretended revelation was simply a dishonest trick on the part<br />
of Joseph Smith to cloak over his own wicked and immoral life, and to keep the peace in his household”.<br />
“For behold I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if you abide not that covenant then are you damned: for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into My glory… And again, as pertaining to the law of the Priesthood, if any man espouse a virgin and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent; and if he espouse the second and they are virgins and have vowed to no other man, then he is justified; for he cannot<br />
commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to none else; and if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong unto him; and they are given unto him; therefore is he justified.” (“Doctrine and Covenants,” chap. 132).</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 3:  JEHOVAH’S WITNESSES<br />
</strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses, also known as Russellites.  Cult founded by C. T. Russell in the 1870s as the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society and renamed as Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1931 under Russell’s successor, J. F. Rutherford. Their theology is essentially a revival of Arianism (a Gnostic based theology that was one of the primary reasons for the first NICENE Council of 325 A.D., resulting in the Nicene Creed, which deals directly with the nature and substance of Christ) in which Jesus Christ is regarded as the first and highest created being, slightly above an archangel. While on earth Christ was only a man energized by the Holy Spirit as the active force of Jehovah. The Witnesses do not believe in a soul without a body and hold that Christ’s mission is to give immortality to humans, either through deathlessness or by resurrection. The Lord’s Supper is celebrated only annually at Passover.</p>
<p>Other cardinal tenets of this heresy include a belief that only 144,000 believers will rule in heaven, while lesser men of goodwill will people the kingdom, which will be established by Jesus Christ at the end of the age on earth. The sect is highly authoritarian and enforces rigid dogmas, such as rejection of blood transfusion and refusal to serve in military forces, or salute national flags. Their churches are called kingdom halls. Active members are called publishers (of the good news) and the less active as pioneers. Members witness from door to door.</p>
<p>Charles Taze Russell’s (1852–1916) theological opposition to the doctrines of the Trinity and eternal punishment led him to form the Jehovah’s Witnesses as a sect to promote his ideas. He was also obsessed with fixing a date for the Second Coming, which he asserted would be in 1884 and, when that did not materialize, in 1914. He was proved wrong both times. In 1884 he set up Zion’s Watchtower Tract Society in Pittsburgh to produce literature for his followers. The sect’s theology is contained in the six volumes of his Studies in the Scriptures (1886–1904) plus a seventh volume on the Revelation.</p>
<p>Several  Doctrine’s of The Jehovah’s Witnesses (as stated in 1997 publications)<br />
1. “Jesus lived in heaven as a spirit person before he came to earth.  He was God’s first creation, and so he is called the “firstborn Son of God”.  Jesus is the only Son that God created by Himself.  Jehovah used the pre-human Jesus as his “master worker” in creating all other things in heaven and on earth.”<br />
2. “Soon Jesus will judge people, separating them as a shepherd separates sheep from goats.  The “sheep” are those who have proved to be his loyal subjects.  They will receive everlasting life on earth.  Jehovah has also selected some faithful men and women to go to heaven.  They will rule with Jesus as kings, judges, and priests over mankind.  The “goats” are those who will have rejected God’s Kingdom.  In the near future, Jesus will destroy all goat-like ones.”<br />
3. “Jesus died and was resurrected by God as a spirit creature, and he returned to heaven.”<br />
4. “The dead cannot do anything or feel anything.  The soul dies, it does not live on after death.”<br />
5. “Would a loving God really torment people forever?  The wicked, of course, are not literally tormented because, as we have seen, when a person is dead he is completely out of existence.  And it is also a lie, which the Devil spread, that the souls of the wicked are tormented.”<br />
6. “God’s Kingdom is a special government.  It is set up in heaven and will rule over this earth.  Jesus’ disciples must be no part of this wicked world.  They do not get involved in the world’s political affairs and social controversies.”</p>
<p><em>Statements from official “Watchtower” publications<br />
</em>“The obvious conclusion is, therefore, that Satan is the originator of the Trinity doctrine” (“Let God Be True”)</p>
<p>“The true Scriptures speak of God’s Son, the Word, as “a god”.  He is a mighty god, but not the Almighty God, who is Jehovah.”  (“The Truth Shall Make You Free”)</p>
<p>“As for the “Holy Spirit”, the so-called “third person of the trinity”, we have already seen that it is not a person, but God’s active force.”  (“The Truth That Leads To Eternal Life”)</p>
<p>“Jesus, no more and no less than a perfect human, became a ransom that compensated exactly for what Adam had lost.”  (“Should You Believe In The Trinity?”)</p>
<p>“This firstborn from the dead was raised from the grave, not a human creature, but a spirit.”  (“Let God Be True”)</p>
<p>“Man is a combination of two things, namely, the dust of the ground and the breath of life.  The combining of these two things produced a living soul or creature called man.  So we see that the claim of the religionists that man has an immortal soul and therefore differs from the beast is not scriptural.”  (Let God Be True”)<br />
The Problem Of The “New World Translation Of The Scriptures”</p>
<p>The Jehovah’s Witnesses have produced their own translation of the Bible that is considered the “authoritative” translation, and which is used to support their doctrines, especially those regarding the deity of Christ.  However, a problem arises when one considers the qualifications of those who did the translating, as well as their misrepresentations of the various language tools that they used that had been produced by actual scholars.  See the attached material on this subject.</p>
<p>The text of the Nicene Creed as Regards Jesus Christ  A.D. 325<br />
“WE believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of all things, visible and invisible: And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father, only begotten, that is, of the substance of the Father; God of God; Light of light; very God of very God; begotten, not made; being of one substance with the Father, By whom all things were made, both things in heaven and things in earth: Who for us men and for our salvation came down, and was incarnate, and was made man: He suffered, and rose again the third day: And ascended into heaven: And shall come again to judge the quick and the dead.”</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 4:  Freemasonry</strong></p>
<p><strong>What is Masonry?<br />
</strong>Also known as “Freemasonry” or “The Lodge”, Masonry is a fraternal order that was organized in 1717 AD in London.  It professes to trace its’ roots back to King Solomon’s Temple, but there is no Biblical or historical evidence to support this assertion.  Although Masonry in the United States professes itself to be based upon the Bible, numerous statements of its’ own authors, as well as any subjective examination of its’ teachings and doctrine will reveal that it is thoroughly pagan and satanic in its teaching.  Many Masons honestly believe that they can be both Masons and Christians, but in reality, this is not the case.</p>
<p><strong>How is Masonry organized?<br />
</strong>There are three groups of Masonry; The Blue Lodge (which is the root or basis for all Masonry), and the York Rite and Scottish Rite (which are separate branches that come after the Blue Lodge).  All Masons must go through the Blue Lodge before they can enter either the York Rite or Scottish Rite (although some Masons do both branches).  Each branch consists of “degrees” which must be ascended as one progresses in Masonry.  In addition to the three degrees of the Blue Lodge, the York Rite confers 10 additional degrees, while the Scottish Rite confers 30 additional degrees.</p>
<p><strong>Is Masonry a Religion?<br />
</strong>Although the vast majority of Masons would deny it, Masonry IS a religion.  It meets all of the definitions of a religious group, in that it meets the definition of a religion, as stated in Webster’s Dictionary, which defines “religion” as:  1) a belief in a divine or superhuman power… to be obeyed and worshipped as the Creator and ruler of the universe; and 2) expression of this belief in conduct and ritual.”</p>
<p>Masonic author Henry Wilson Coil, speaking of the service done at the funeral of a deceased Mason, writes the following in “Coils Masonic Encyclopedia”:  “Freemasonry has a religious service to commit the body of a deceased brother to the dust whence it came, and to speed the liberated spirit back to the Great Source of Light.  Many Freemasons make this flight with no other guarantee of a safe landing than their belief in the religion of Freemasonry.”</p>
<p><strong>Is the “God” of Masonry the God of the Bible?<br />
</strong>Although many Masons claim that the “God” of Masonry (commonly known as the “Great Architect of the Universe”, or “G.A.O.T.U.”) is the God of the Bible, this is clearly not the case.  Although extensive study will prove conclusively that the “God” of Masonry is, in reality, Lucifer, we do not have the space to document all of that here.  However it suffices to note that in the York Rite degree entitled the “Royal Arch” degree, the candidate is told that the “lost name of God” will be revealed to them.  The name they are given is “JAHBULON”, which is a composite term that links the Old Testament name of God (JEHOVAH) with the Caananite deity BAAL and the Egyptian deity OSIRIS (this is documented in “Duncan’s Ritual of Freemasonry”, page 226, footnote 1).  This is DIRECTLY in disobedience to Exodus 20:3-5.</p>
<p><strong>Can a man be both a Mason AND a Biblical Christian?<br />
</strong>Albert Mackey, writing in “Mackey’s Revised Encyclopedia of Freemasonry” writes the following: “The religion of Freemasonry is not sectarian.  It admits men of every creed within its hospitable bosom, rejecting none and approving none for his peculiar faith.  It is not Judaism, though there is nothing in it to offend the Jew; it is not Christianity, but there is nothing in it repugnant to the faith of a Christian.  Its religion is that general one of nature and primitive revelation handed down to us from some ancient and patriarchal priesthood – in which all men may agree and in which no men can differ.”</p>
<p>Notice in the statement that Masonry is:<br />
A) a religion<br />
B) a NATURE religion<br />
C) a religion handed down by a PRIESTHOOD (which research reveals to be the Egyptian mystery religion and priesthood)<br />
D) and finally, is a universal and supposedly ecumenical religion of the “lowest common denominator”.</p>
<p>All of the above are in DIRECT contradiction to Acts 4:12, John 14:6, and John 15:4-5.  This being the case, it is evident that, however well intentioned, a man CANNOT be both a faithful Mason AND a Biblical Christian.  By participating in Masonry, a man is actively participating in a religion OTHER than Christianity, taking oath to a God OTHER than the God of the Bible, and DIRECTLY disobeying Scripture.</p>
<p><strong>Hiram Abiff &#8211; the Masonic Savior?<br />
</strong>The Grand Lodge of Kentucky, in it monitor and writings, provides unmistakable evidence that Freemasonry teaches, not only that there are many different saviors for various peoples, but that Hiram Abiff is considered a savior for Freemasons. The context is a discussion of various world religions.<br />
“All believed in a future life, to be attained by purification and trials; in a state or successive states of reward and punishment; and in a Mediator or Redeemer, by whom the Evil Principle was to be overcome and the Supreme Deity reconciled to His creatures. The belief was general that He was to be born of a virgin and suffer a painful death. The Hindus called him Krishna; the Chinese, Kioun-tse; the Persians, Sosiosch; the Chaldeans, Dhouvanai; the Egyptians, Horus; Plato, Love; the Scandinavians, Balder; the Christians, Jesus; Masons, Hiram Abiff.”</p>
<p>Masonry teaches that Jesus is not unique. Notice the parallel sentence structure: Hindus -  Krishna; Christians -  Jesus, Masons &#8211; Hiram. They clearly are teaching that Krishna is a savior for Hindus, Jesus is a savior for Christians and Hiram Abiff is a savior for Masons. The teaching that Hiram is the Masonic savior is found in more than a few books distributed throughout the Masonic system.  Masonry, in its various practices and degrees, exhalts Baal, Osiris, Allah, Abaddon, and many others, including Lucifer himself (in the 14th degree, where he is called the Light-Bearer)! </p>
<p>Another problem of direct conflict with Biblical Christianity is the “taking on of sins” in one of the degrees.  At the top of the York Rite series of degrees is the Commandery of the Knights Templar.  In this initiation, the candidate is brought before a large triangular table covered in black velvet illuminated by candles and containing 11 silver goblets and a human skull enthroned on a Bible.  This is intended to be a blasphemous representation of the Last Supper.  The candidate is invited to partake of five libations (toasts).  The first four are given respectively to King Solomon, Hiram (King of Tyre), Hiram Abiff, and Simon of Cyrene.  However, the candidate is NEVER told who the fifth libation is drunk to, but is told that it is SEALED.  The fifth libation is drunk from the human skull, and is accompanied by an oath,  which says in part: “as the sins of the whole world were once visited upon the head of our Savior, so may all the sins of the person whose skull this once was, in addition to my own, be heaped upon my head, and may this libation appear in judgment against me, should I ever knowingly or willingly violate my most solemn vow of a Knight Templar, so help me God…”  In this oath, the candidate is specifically asking for their OWN sins (which, if they claim to be a Christian, have been cleansed by the blood of Christ) AND the sins of another, unknown person to placed upon their soul.</p>
<p>The problem of Masonic infiltration into the Church is seen in the following article, from The Berean Call Newsletter, October 1993.</p>
<p>“One example of Satan ’s subtle tactics is found in Masonry. Its influence permeates both the world and the church. A Masonic-dominated Supreme Court legalized abortion and put Christianity out of public schools. Masonry is an anti-Christian religious cult rooted in Hinduism, occultism and other forms of paganism. Masonry assures members that through good works and obedience to its tenets they will reach the Celestial Lodge in the Sky presided over by the G.A.O.T.U (Great Architect of the Universe),which is “God as you conceive him to be.” Masonic authority Carl H. Claudy writes, “Masonry &#8230;requires merely that you believe in some deity, give him what name you will, any god will do.” Yet more than 1 million Southern Baptist laymen and clergy are in the “brotherhood” and most of them would defend it as “Christian.” In fact, this year ’s annual convention of Southern Baptists voted that being a Mason was compatible with Christianity.”</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 5:  The New Age Movement</strong></p>
<p>An especially important threat to orthodox Christianity that borrows heavily from Eastern religions is the New Age Movement. Though the movement began in the 1960s, it especially took form in 1971 with the book Be Here Now by Baba Ram Das.  The movement centers on a personal spiritual-psychological transformation, which in many instances is a kind of crisis experience, but in a majority of cases involves change over a period of time.</p>
<p>Elements of Eastern religion and transpersonal psychology provide tools for spiritual transformation and include meditation, intensive seminars, healing at the hands of a New Age healer (a kind of Indian guru), wearing crystals, psychological reorientation experiences, and so on.  For them God tends to be a universal power, a unifying principle, an underlying reality of the universe, discovered by mystical states of consciousness and binding nature and humanity together.</p>
<p>New Agers believe that eventually there will be one universal religion. And they believe that the universal religion, the new way of looking at things, will transform society, will bring about a new age. Others work actively toward a transformation of society with a networking of like-minded individuals to transform education, ecological policy, business organization, national and world politics, and more. They have merged with the holistic health movement. Many of them have joined human rights and animal rights organizations. Since personal transformation requires a long path of growth and cannot be completed in one lifetime, a great many in the movement have subscribed to a belief in reincarnation.</p>
<p>The New Age Movement is essentially a modernized form of Gnosticism.  For those who will not accept the “simplicity that is in Christ” (2 Cor. 11:3) as the way to spiritual fullness, the liar offers other sources of “spirituality.” This is what I mean by a modern Gnosticism that suggests that there are other gospels, other Christs, other “holy” spirits, other hidden spiritual mysteries to understand and experience (2 Cor. 11:4; cf. Matt. 24:23–28; Gal. 1:6–9).</p>
<p>This deception unifies the syncretistic theology of the New Age movement. One of the main teachings of the New Age movement is “You are God.” What did the serpent promise Eve? “You will be (like) God . . .” The New Age movement is not so new after all.</p>
<p>The New Age movement is dangerous because it seems so right for modern man. It denies the objective reality of evil centered in an evil being called Satan. It inclines itself towards “good” things. It seeks to encourage the full development of human potential. It champions nature, world peace, a new world order.</p>
<p>Christian apologist Dr. Norman Geisler lists thirteen major views of reality which identify the New Age movement.<br />
1. It begins with pantheism. God is all and all is god. The Bible teaches theism. Theism declares that God is “to the world what a painter is to a painting. God is to the world what a playwright is to a play.”<br />
Geisler says, “Pantheism says God is to the world what a pond is to drops. We’re all little drops in an infinite point. We’re all one great big drip, we’re all one great big drop.”<br />
Thus God is an “It.” God is not a father but a force. “May the Force be with you” is pantheism, the New Age view of God.</p>
<p>2. The New Age is philosophical monism. Monism says there is only one essence in the universe. Atheism is monism: It affirms that the one reality is matter. The New Age is monism: It says that the one reality is God.<br />
God is nature and nature is God. God is the water, the air, the whale, the trees. “This is why New Agers show unrealistic passion for the water, the air, the whales and the trees. While we all should be concerned about the environment, the New Agers’ concern is a religious concern. They are God,” Geisler says.</p>
<p>3. There is holism. If nature is God and God is nature, all is God. Thus the New Age advocates holism.</p>
<p>4. There is self-deification. If God is all, pantheism; if God is all that exists, monism; if all is God, holism; then man is God, human deification. This is self- deification.</p>
<p>5. This leads to imbalanced immanence. Where do we go to find God? We do not look to the heavens above nor to the earth below. We look inside of us. There we find God.</p>
<p>6. There is extreme mysticism. This is the ultimate in mysticism. Godhood is obtainable. If you will look within, if you will center on yourself, if you will realize that you are god, if you will awaken from your amnesia, you will find god.</p>
<p>7. There is reincarnation. We gods have to learn to be God, but if we miss it in this life, we can still obtain it in the next. Or in the next! Or the next! Or the next! Geisler goes so far as to say that reincarnation is, in this sense, “the heart of the New Age movement.”   This also helps explain the positive view of New Agers toward abortion. If 4,300 women per day abort an unborn baby in the U.S., that is acceptable. According to many New Agers, it is because these babies sinned in a previous life. They are “punished” by abortion. Yet they will have a chance for another birth yet to come.  Reincarnation leads to other extremes, also. For example, Geisler says, “You know what homosexual New Agers say? Why am I homosexual? Because I have a female soul from a previous life trapped in a male body and I can’t help it.”</p>
<p>8. There is illusion. This means good and evil are one and the same thing. This is a hard concept to grasp until we go back to pantheism, monism, holism, and self-deification. If God is all, and all is God, then whatever exists is God. Thus, what we call good and what we call evil are only different sides of the same coin which we call God. Thus, since all is God, both good and bad are really illusions. God is both good and evil.</p>
<p>9. There is animism. The universe is alive. It is all spirit. Geisler points out that<br />
many of our young people are being taught the Gaia principle, that there is a living force behind everything. . . . This is animism. This is paganism. This is why we sent missionaries to . . . the world because they believed in this pagan idea that everything is living. And now it is being taught in the name of science in our universities and our schools in America today.</p>
<p>10. There is evolutionism. The world, that is human society, is evolving. Geisler remarks that New Agers don’t believe in Darwinian evolution—they are concerned about spiritual evolution. They are not concerned about the theory that man came from animals. They are concerned about the fact that man can evolve into God. </p>
<p>11. There is optimism. “New Agers are incurable optimists, not pessimists,” Geisler says. This appeals irresistibly to our pessimistic world. New Agers believe that the world is getting better and better. This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius. The millennium is coming and the New Agers are going to bring it in. They believe that one day the entire world will be won and all world leaders will work together. There is a New Age coming.  Their strategy is to gradually develop their goal of a new world order through a new world consciousness. This conversion process will be accomplished by a new world spiritual energy field, the god force within each human being. They use every person, organization, concept, or whatever, which can be harnessed toward the emergence of the new world order.</p>
<p>12. There is globalism.  Globalism naturally arises out of social evolutionism and almost deterministic optimism. The entire human race will become one. This is the world as one global village.</p>
<p>13. There is ecumenism. We have dealt with the scourge of ecumenism several times in our study.  Ecumenism is the belief that all religious and spiritual beliefs are equal, and in many ways, interchangeable.   We can all join together in one ecumenical religion, because we are all really saying the same things anyway.  That is a good definition reflecting what the New Age must do to bring about the new world order. All religious and philosophies must be combined. All religions will be combined into one eclectic world religion.</p>
<p>How is this being implemented on a large scale?  Perhaps the most successful achievement from the perspective of New Age strategy is the success of the movement in infiltrating American education. The New Age has correctly perceived the public school system to be their mission field. Where could you find a more captive audience? Where could you find a more strategic audience to affect world control for the next century?  Textbooks published by tax dollars containing both subtle and even more overt occultic New Age philosophy are increasingly being used in classrooms throughout the U.S. Some are replete with New Age buzz words like “new consciousness,” “energy fields,” “centering,” “holistic,” “transcendental,” “interdependent,” “global village,” “planetary vision,” “meditation,” “higher consciousness,” “humanism,” “full inner potential,” “transcendent power,” “tapping into the force,” “new birth,” “the untapped energy of the universe,” and so forth. All of these words in themselves are neutral. Skillfully used, they condition children and young people, already on their way through TV and the movies, towards a New Age world view.</p>
<p>Norman Geisler quotes from a textbook used in the public schools in Arkansas. He says that one chapter, subtitled “Future Energy,” “explores the energy of life. Then they quote from one of the world’s great experts on energy, Yoda: ‘My ally is the force and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow, its energy surrounds us and binds us, luminous beings are we. You must feel the force around you, hear the tree, the rock, everywhere.’ ”  Geisler then comments, “I thought you couldn’t teach religion in the public schools. Well, you can’t teach the Christian religion, but you can teach New Age religion.” Geisler continues saying the same textbook has a section on photography showing “spirit photos,” as they call them, teaching young people that there is a spiritual force here that we haven’t tapped into.  He tells of a series of a fifteen-book curriculum for kindergarten through sixth grade called Impressions. They contain both horror and occultic stories. The teaching manual for the third grade suggests “write and chant a magic spell to make objects in the room float.”<br />
Geisler next tells of educational programs with neutral titles that are primarily New Age. One is called New Age Accelerated Learning. It uses New Age books. It is followed in some parts of San Diego, California. He says the authors draw their techniques from mental yoga, music, sleep walking, physiology, hypnosis, autogenics, parapsychology, and drama.</p>
<p>Some schools are stressing confluent education. Dr. Beverly Galean, former project director for three federally funded programs in Los Angeles, said, “Once we see that we are all god then I think the whole purpose of human life is to re-own the God likeness within us.”<br />
In some learning centers for school teachers, yoga is openly taught and paid for with tax dollars. Mind control is advocated. Chanting is practiced. Meditation and relaxation techniques assuming the famous Hindu lotus position is taught. Astral projection is encouraged. Occult role games like Dungeons and Dragons are played. Children are told that there are two mysterious regions that need further exploration, outer space and inner space. You explore outer space through the telescope and space travel. You explore inner space by assuming the lotus position and meditating on the force within you.<br />
The New Age has also captivated many business organizations. Some of their training programs for their employees involve New Age philosophy. Then there is the captivity of some branches of the health industry and of the music industry. Very different from rock music, New Age music for meditation and relaxation helps one “converse with nature, to be one with the universe.”</p>
<p>Finally, there is the influence of New Age theology on the church. Subtle pantheistic views are being taught. Counterfeit theology becomes a substitute for biblical theology. Dominion theology and prosperity theology are really New Age concepts. Many sincere Christian leaders do not recognize this. Extremes in signs-and-wonders theology, name-it-and-claim-it, visualization, and mystical meditation come close to the claims and practices of Science of Mind. Whatever you can visualize you can claim. That you can have and you can be anything your imagination can create is not biblical. It is demonic. </p>
<p>The New Age movement is a satanic movement of self-deification diametrically opposed to Christianity. The terrible danger arises from its deceptive packaging. It even has infiltrated the Christian church, and we need to remind ourselves of those words of 1 John 4:1, “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.”</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 6:  Unitarian Universalist</strong></p>
<p>Unitarianism is a heretical Christian tradition that affirms monotheism but rejects both the Trinity and the divinity of Christ. Its modern exponents are united by no single set of beliefs but generally represent a free-thinking liberalism. In the early church there were intimations of anti-Trinitarianism among the Arians, Paulicians, and Monarchians. But organized Unitarianism dates from the Reformation period when it was established in Poland, Hungary, and England.</p>
<p>In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries Unitarian ideas were propagated by Martin Cellarius, Johannes Reuchlin, Michael Servetus, and Bernardino Ochino. In Poland, Unitarians were led by George Blandrata and Fausto Sozzini who were instrumental in the publication of the Racovian Catechism. Blandrata also was responsible for the spread of Unitarianism in Hungary, where he converted King Sigismund. In England John Biddle (1615–1662) is considered the “Father of Unitarianism,” and a century later the scientist Joseph PrIestley lent his skills to further Unitarianism.  In the eighteenth century Unitarian views were fashionable among all dissenting congregations. In 1853 the Hibbert Trust was founded to promote liberal theology, and in 1888 Manchester College was founded under the sect’s auspices. In America, King’s Chapel, Boston, was the first to turn itself into a Unitarian congregation in 1785. Over the course of the next century many congregational churches in eastern Massachusetts adopted Unitarian beliefs.</p>
<p>In the writings of William Ellery Channing, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and others, Unitarianism is presented as nothing more than a bundle of ethical precepts. Many prominent Americans like Thomas Jefferson were antitrinitarians. In 1805 Henry Ware, a liberal, was appointed to the chair of the Harvard Divinity School, and he turned the school permanently into a Unitarian bastion. The American Unitarian Association was founded in 1825 and the National Conference of Unitarian Churches in 1865. In 1961 the American Unitarian Association joined with the Universalist Church of America to form the Unitarian Universalist Association. Unitarianism has steadily lost ground in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>The Universalist Church of America is a North American sect that believes in the final reconciliation of all human beings with God. It was created in eighteenth-century America, the first congregation was organized in 1779, and the first creed was adopted in 1790. The Winchester Platform of 1803 emphasized the perfectibility of all human beings, the ultimate salvation of all created beings, and the humanity of Christ. Early leaders included John Murray, Hosea Ballou, and Elhanan Winchester. In 1961 it merged with the American Unitarian Association to form the Unitarian Universalist Association.</p>
<p><strong>TRINITARIAN HERESIES<br />
</strong>In dealing with the relation of Jesus and the Father, and the resulting Trinitarian concept, various attempts were made to reconcile Jesus’ deity with the principle that there is only one God.  Unitarianism, also called “dynamic monarchianism,” was an attempt to give Jesus a secondary sort of deity, and thus to preserve the unity of God by attributing true deity only to the Father. In 260, Paul of Samosata, bishop of Antioch, was the most famous teacher of this doctrine. Cloaking his views in orthodox language, he taught that Jesus was indwelt by the Logos more than others and, because of his moral development, achieved divine status. He denied personality to the Logos of God and to the Holy Spirit, which he thought to be attributes of God, not separate persons. His teachings were uncovered by Malchion; his views were condemned, and he was deposed about 268.</p>
<p>The modern Unitarian Universalist teachings are basically a “re-hash” of this old heresy that provides a refuge for people who are “religious” enough to want to go to a church, but who flatly refuse to submit to the Word of God.<br />
How does this relate to the Bible?  This group rejects the deity of Christ and the fact of judgment upon mankind.</p>
<p>John 1:1-18<br />
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2 He was in the beginning with God.<br />
3 All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.<br />
6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 7 This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe. 8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.<br />
9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world.<br />
10 He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him. 11 He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.<br />
12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: 13 who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.<br />
14 And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.<br />
15 John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.’ ”<br />
16 And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17 For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18 No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</p>
<p>Revelation 20:11-15<br />
11 Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. 12 And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. 13 The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to his works. 14 Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. 15 And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 7:  Christian Science</strong></p>
<p>Christian Science &#8211; Officially, Church of Christ, Scientist. Heretical cult founded by Mary Baker Eddy (1821–1910), headquartered in Boston. Its core doctrine is physical healing through the manipulation of prayer. She set out her teaching in Science and Health, with a Key to the Scriptures, which she claimed was written under divine inspiration, although it is flawed by poor grammar and many inaccuracies. She promoted her book heavily, and its sales helped her to establish Christian Science as a church devoted to her ideas in 1879. It was reorganized on a permanent basis in 1892. The church is governed by a board of five directors in accordance with the Church Manual prepared by the founder. The church has no preachers and no sermons. Instead, each church has two readers who read portions of the Scriptures to the assembly followed by hymns and a selection from Science and Health. Interpretation of the Scriptures, outside the founder’s comments, is forbidden. The divinity of Jesus is denied, although the historicity of the Gospels is accepted. One of the chief assets of the church is the newspaper, Christian Science Monitor.</p>
<p>We must regard the so-called “Christian Science” as neither Christian nor scientific. Mrs. Mary Baker G. Eddy denies the authority of all that part of revelation which God has made to man in nature, and holds that the laws of nature may be disregarded with impunity by those who have proper faith.  Her basic premise is that all of the “material universe” is an illusion, and that true spirituality is based upon learning to deny the material.  This is just a re-hash of the same Gnostic heresies that have been recycled over and over again throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>“People are looking for a comfortable life here, and an easy way to heaven. They are scanning earth and sky for a royal road. The fight with sin which the Gospel demands is a fierce and bitter fight; and many men and women are anxiously searching for a way of escape, desiring to be “carried to the skies on flowery beds of ease.”  This desire lies at the basis of Eddyism. Its fundamental principle is that sin and sickness have no real existence. They may be banished by a process of thought. There is no matter; mind is everything. And, in proportion to the progress of the individual in this creed, all disagreeable and unpleasant things vanish.”  MAURICE E. WILSON, D. D.,  Dayton, Ohio<br />
Mrs. Eddy’s basic propositions are four in number, and are thus expressed<br />
in her own words:  “First, God is all in all. Second, God is good, good is mind. Third, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter. Fourth, Life, God, omnipotent good, deny death, evil, sin, disease. Disease, sin, evil, death, deny good, omnipotent God, Life” (“Science and Health”).  Unconscious of the absurdity of the thing, she placidly tells us that since these statements may be read backward as well as forward, this is a proof that they are true! “The Divine metaphysics &#8230;. proves the rule by inversion.”</p>
<p>Eddy’s teachings on several subjects are as follows:<br />
“GOD”<br />
What does Mrs. Eddy teach concerning God? Well, for one thing, that God<br />
is not a person. He is “Principle”; and of the same impersonal character as<br />
the “principle of mathematics.” That is her own analogy — “the principle<br />
of mathematics.” This statement is iterated and reiterated with intense<br />
positiveness. God, moreover, is the only Principle.</p>
<p>“PRAYER”<br />
Consequently, the teachings of “Science and Health” preclude all need and<br />
all possibility of prayer. If God is only “Principle”, one might as well pray<br />
to “the principle of mathematics”, or to chemical affinity, or to the<br />
Constitution of the United States.  There is an entire chapter devoted to “Prayer”. But it is not Christian prayer at all. Mrs. Eddy’s prayer is virtually an attempt at auto-suggestion (or self-hypnosis).</p>
<p>She found it impossible to keep her hands off of the Lord’s Prayer.<br />
Every Sabbath in every one of her congregations her version of the Lord’s<br />
Prayer is read aloud, sentence by sentence alternately, with that version<br />
which we owe to the record of the Gospels. The audience, led by one of the readers, recites the Christian version; and the other reader recites Mrs. Eddy’s<br />
version, which is:  Our Father-Mother God, all harmonious, Adorable One, Thy kingdom is come; Thou art ever-present.  Enable us to know, &#8211; as in heaven, so on earth, &#8211; God is omnipotent, supreme.  Give us grace for today; feed the famished affections; And love is reflected in love; And God leadeth us not into temptation, but delivereth us from sin, desease, and death.  For God is infinite, all-power, all Life, Truth, Love, over all, and All.</p>
<p><strong>“SIN AND ATONEMENT”</strong><br />
“The only reality of sin is the awful fact that it seems real to human belief, until God strips off its disguise.” Sin is an illusion, we are informed. “God is all in all. God is good. Therefore all is good.”  Therefore nothing is evil!  As to the Atonement, or the relation of Christ to the fact of sin, Eddyism favors us with the amazing statement that “The Atonement is the exemplification of man’s unity with God”! There is no sin to be atoned for, and no need for a ransom to be paid.  “The true Logos is demonstrably Christian Science” (“Science and Health”).  If that were so, then we might read the first verse of the Gospel according to John in this way: “In the beginning was Christian Science, and Christian Science was with God, and Christian Science was God. All things were made by Christian Science, and without Christian Science was not anything made that was made.” We are also told that the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, is Christian Science!</p>
<p><strong>“RESURRECTION”<br />
</strong>It is important to note what Mrs. Eddy has to say about the resurrection of<br />
Jesus Christ.  “The lonely precincts of the tomb gave Jesus a refuge from His<br />
foes”, where “He met and mastered, on the basis of Christian Science, all the claims of medicine, surgery and hygiene” (“Science and Health”).<br />
“But it was not a supernatural act” (“Science and Health”).<br />
“His disciples believed Jesus dead while He was hidden in the sepulchre; whereas He was alive, demonstrating within the narrow tomb the power of Spirit to over-rule mortal, material sense” (“Science and Health”).<br />
When “Jesus’ students … saw Him after His crucifixion,” they “learned<br />
that He had not died” (“Science and Health”).<br />
Mrs. Eddy speaks of His condition “after what seemed to be death,” and<br />
she quotes Paul in this fashion, “we were reconciled to God by the (seeming) death of His Son” (“Science and Health”).</p>
<p>The devil is never more dangerous than when he gets into the pulpit or the<br />
theological chair and pretends to teach Christianity, when in reality he is<br />
corrupting it; pretends to teach Christian evidences, when in reality he is<br />
undermining the foundations of faith; pretends to teach biblical introduction, when in reality be is casting the Bible as a book unworthy of being introduced. Look out for him; this is when he is at his most dangerous work.  Happy is the person who is not ignorant and realizes that the devil frequently masquerades as an angel of light.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The God Who Communicates:</strong></p>
<p>Although Christians live in the “New Testament” because of our relationship with Jesus Christ; it is important that we make use of what God has given us in the “Old Testament” to gain understanding of what Christianity and the Christian life is all about.  The first part of our framework for understanding Scripture is to understand the basic purpose of the Bible; which is to communicate. <span id="more-1201"></span> God intends His Word to speak to us; to transmit to us what He wants us to know about Himself, and about His plan for us.  He did not make it purposefully hard to understand, nor did He seek to confuse us.  The problem is that He is communicating very broad and complex ideas that are beyond our normal comprehension.  This cannot be done in short, two or three word sentences, but requires a lot of explanations, definition of terms, examples to illustrate the various points, and so on. </p>
<p> Think of it as a textbook that is trying to teach a subject such as mathematics.  In order to begin, you have to define what it is that you are talking about; explain the various formulas and the rules that they function by; show examples of how the formulas are used and what they apply to; and show the progression from simple math (addition and subtraction) to the “higher” maths (algebra, geometry, calculus, trigonometry, physics, and so on).  In the same way, the Bible is teaching us (sinful human beings) about:  our origins, our nature, our place in the universe, sin, life and death, eternity, holiness, our relationship with our Creator, and our future, among other things.</p>
<p> In order to accomplish these things, He gave us a “book of books” that contains what we need to know about these subjects.  However, the Bible is not a book that be easily understood by a casual reader.  It must be read, studied, meditated upon, prayed over, and applied.  We must examine Scripture with an eye to the definitions and questions that each portions brings up, then learn the definitions and answer the questions.  When we do this, we will find that we have gained a far greater understanding of what God is communicating than if we had stopped at a mere “surface” reading.</p>
<p> For example, let’s consider what is probably the most familiar verse in the Bible for most Christians, John 3:16, which says, “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” (NKJV)  In order to truly understand this verse, we need to understand the following definitions and questions:</p>
<p>  Who is GOD?  Which god?<br />
  Why did He love the world?<br />
  How did He give His Son?<br />
  Who is His Son?<br />
  How was His Son begotten?<br />
  What does “believes on Him” mean?  How do you do this?<br />
  What does He mean by “perish”? <br />
  What is everlasting life, and why should I want it?<br />
 With these things in mind, let’s look at two of the ways that God has provided “resources” for us to use in understanding His Word.  The first is…</p>
<p><strong>The Old Testament As A Dictionary For The New Testament:</strong></p>
<p> Although the Gospel of Jesus Christ is written in the New Testament, and was written in Greek (with some manuscripts in Aramaic), the IDEAS upon which the Gospel is based are all found written in the Old Testament, written in Hebrew.  These ideas, such as “Why do we need a savior?”, “What is sin?”, and “How can the Messiah’s blood save us, 2,000 years later?” are all defined in the Law, Writings, and the Prophets.  In order to truly understand the meaning of the Gospel, you must go back to the foundation laid when God gave the definitions of His Word.  As Paul puts it in Romans 7:7, “What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, “You shall not covet.”</p>
<p> It is God, in the Old Testament, that defined the appropriate sacrifice for sin, which is the shedding of blood.  It is God  who described His intention to give His Son when he stopped Abraham from killing Isaac.  All of the great doctrines of the New Testament have their roots in the Old Testament.  That is where  we must look for understanding of the great power and love of Jesus’ death on the Cross.<br />
The Use Of Types And Symbols:</p>
<p>The word “type” is derived from a Greek term [tupos], which occurs 16 times in the New Testament. It is clear that the New Testament writers use the word “type” with a degree of looseness; yet one general idea is common to all, namely, “likeness.” A person, event or thing is shaped to resemble another; in some ways the one matches the other. The two are called type and antitype; and the link that binds them together is the similarity of the one with the other.</p>
<p>Three other words in the New Testament express the same general idea.<br />
One is “shadow” ([skia], Hebrews 10:1), “For the law having a shadow of the good things to come” — as if the substance or reality that was still future cast its shadow backward into the Old Testament.  “Shadow” implies dimness and temporariness; but it also implies a resemblance between the one and the other.</p>
<p>The 2nd term is “parable” ([parabole], Hebrews 9:9); the tabernacle with its services was an acted parable for the time then present, pre-figuring the blessed reality that was to come.</p>
<p>The 3rd term is “copy.” or “pattern” ([hupodeigma]), a word that denotes a sketch or draft of something future and (at that point) invisible (Hebrews 9:23); the tabernacle and its furniture and services were copies, outlines of heavenly things.</p>
<p>Types are pictures, object lessons, by which God taught His people concerning His grace and saving power. </p>
<p><strong>DISTINCTIVE FEATURES:</strong></p>
<p>What are the distinctive features of a type? A type, to be such in reality,<br />
must possess three well-defined qualities.<br />
(1) It must be a true picture of the person or the thing it represents or<br />
prefigures. A type is a draft or sketch of some feature of redemption, and therefore it must in some way resemble its antitype, e.g. Aaron as high priest is a rough figure of Christ the Great High Priest, and the Day of Atonement in Israel (Leviticus 16) must be a true picture of the atoning work of Christ.</p>
<p>(2) The type must be of DIVINE appointment.  Only God can make types.</p>
<p>(3) A type always prefigures something that is yet to come in the future. A Scriptural type and predictive prophecy are basically the same, differing only in form. </p>
<p><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF TYPES:</strong></p>
<p>(1) Personal types, such as those people of Scripture whose lives and experiences illustrate some principle or truth of redemption. Such are Adam, who is expressly described as the “figure of him that was to come”  (Romans 5:14), Melchizedek, Abraham, Aaron, Joseph, Jonah, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Historical types, in which are included the great historical events that became striking foreshadowings of good things to come, e.g. the Deliverance from the Bondage of Egypt; the Wilderness Journey; the Conquest of Canaan; the Call of Abraham; Deliverances by the Judges, etc.</p>
<p><strong>(3)  Ritual or Physical types, such as the Altar, the Offerings, the Priesthood, the Tabernacle and its furniture, etc.<br />
The Centrality Of Jesus Christ In All Of Scripture:<br />
</strong>The second primary part of our framework is that we understand that everything in Scripture revolves around Jesus, both in the Old Testament as well as in the New.  He is the focal point of all of Scripture.  One way to understand this is to imagine how you would adequately document a sculpture if you could only use a regular 35mm camera.  Since you couldn’t take one picture of all of the sides at one time, you would have to take a series of shots, from a variety of different angles, to produce a clear understanding of the statue as a whole.  This series of photos would have to be examined as a group in order to get a grasp of the detail of all aspects of the statue, from all directions.  This is the same way that we have to look at Scripture.  Jesus Christ is so awesome, in so many ways, that no one written story can encompass the whole.  So God gave us a series of written stories, told from a variety of viewpoints, so that we could gain a clearer picture of Jesus.  These stories range from Genesis (Jesus as creator and covenant-maker), through the rest of the Law (Jesus as Righteousness), the historical writings (Jesus as One who guides His People, and Who controls the World), the Prophets (Jesus as Judge and Savior, the ultimate victor), into the New Testament Gospels (Jesus as Savior, the Lamb of God who takes a way the sin of the world), the Epistle’s (Jesus working in the lives of the saved), and finally to the Revelation (Jesus as King of Kings, who returns the earth (and the saved) to their originally intended perfection).</p>
<p><strong>The Covenants Of God:<br />
</strong>The basis of our understanding of our relationship with God is an understanding of what a covenant is, how it works, and what God intends by entering into covenant with us.  The word &#8220;covenant&#8221; in the Hebrew is &#8220;beréÆth&#8221; which means “a cutting,” with reference to the custom of cutting or dividing animals in two and passing between the parts in ratifying a covenant.  It is more than a contract, although to look at it that way is fairly correct.  The fact that God, who is infinite, perfect, and all-powerful, would condescend to enter into covenants with humanity is a mark of His love for us, and His desire to have fellowship with us.</p>
<p>A series of key divine covenants forms the backbone of God’s dealings with human beings. Because of our inability to secure our own prosperity—spiritual and physical—on the earth, a gracious God has committed Himself to providing what we cannot.</p>
<p>The main biblical covenants are a unifying factor for all events described in the Bible involving God and human beings. Some of them provide the guarantee that yet—future predicted events will occur. For example, the Abrahamic covenant is the basis for all of God’s subsequent dealings with Israel, and is expanded in the Land, Davidic, and New covenants, which, respectively, provide for Israel’s eternal possession of the land, an eternal kingship, and the conversion of a remnant.</p>
<p><strong>The major biblical covenants, along with the location of the their occurrence, are:<br />
</strong>1. Edenic; Gen. 2:16<br />
2. Adamic; Gen. 3:15<br />
3. Noahic; Gen. 9:16<br />
4. Abrahamic; Gen. 12:2<br />
5. Mosaic; Ex. 19:5<br />
6. Land; Dt. 30:3<br />
7. Davidic; 2 Sam. 7:16<br />
8. New; Heb. 8:8</p>
<p><strong>The Initiator Of The Covenants:<br />
</strong>In every case, it is GOD who is the initiator of the various Scriptural covenants with mankind.  This is an important point, because it demonstrates God’s desire to deal with man, rather than just “forcing” us to “be good” by changing our nature from people who have the ability to make conscious choices to mindless automatons.  God not only loves us, He desires a relationship with us that is based on our free will.  He initiates the action of bringing grace and mercy to us, but He does so in a way that respects us as the part of Creation that was created to have open, loving fellowship with Him.</p>
<p><strong>The Permanence Of The Covenants:<br />
</strong>All of the covenants that God has made with us are PERMANENT covenants.  This is important because it shows the nature of the relationship that God desires to have with us.  He desires a permanent relationship; one that will last for eternity.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>LESSON 1:  HOMOSEXUALITY</strong></p>
<p>Both in the OT (Gen. 19:1–26; Lev. 18:22; 20:13) and in the NT (Rom. 1:18–32; 1 Cor. 6:9; 1 Tim. 1:10), God condemns the sin of homosexuality. He showed His wrath against it by destroying the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Under the law of Moses, sodomy was punishable by death. No practicing homosexual will inherit the kingdom of God.<span id="more-1198"></span></p>
<p>So-called “gays” pay a high price for their immoral lifestyle. Paul says that they receive in themselves “the penalty of their error which was due” (Rom. 1:27b). This includes venereal diseases, pneumocystis, Kaposi’s sarcoma (a form of cancer) and AIDS. It also includes haunting guilt, mental and emotional disturbances, and abnormal personality changes.</p>
<p>Like all other sinners, a homosexual or lesbian can be saved if he or she repents of sin and receives the Lord Jesus Christ as personal Savior. God loves the gay person and the lesbian even if He hates their sin.</p>
<p>There is a difference between being a practicing homosexual and having a homosexual tendency. It is the practice that the Bible condemns, not the orientation. There are many who have an attraction to their own sex but refuse to give in to it. By the power of the Spirit, they have disciplined themselves to resist the temptation and to live in purity. Many Christian persons of homosexual orientation have regarded their condition with sorrow and contrition, but, unable to change (at least at the current point), have drawn on the Spirit for the power of forbearance and chastity, which is sanctification indeed. In commitment to Christ, they have offered an enduring inner blemish for God’s use so that divine power may be perfected in human weakness.</p>
<p>Some blame God that they were born with this tendency, but the fault does not lie with God but with human sinfulness. Every fallen child of Adam has evil tendencies. Some have a weakness in one area, some in another. The sin is not in being tempted, but in yielding to the temptation.</p>
<p>There is deliverance from homosexuality or lesbianism, as there is from any form of lust. However, ongoing godly counseling assistance is very important in nearly every case.  Christians should accept gays and lesbians as persons without approving their lifestyle. Because they are people for whom Christ died, believers should seek in every possible way to win them to a life of “holiness, without which no one will see the Lord” (Heb. 12:14).<br />
What the world says about the issue of homosexuality/lesbianism:</p>
<p>“I can’t help it, it is in my genes.”<br />
“God never speaks against homosexuality, Paul was just a homophobe.”<br />
“When the Bible talks about homosexuality, it is talking about rape, not a committed, loving relationship.”<br />
“It’s okay because I love him/her, and God loves love.”</p>
<p>Let’s look at each one of these:  “I can’t help it, it is in my genes.”</p>
<p><strong>GENETICS AND HOMOSEXUALITY</strong></p>
<p>Homosexuals have long claimed they are different not just in their behavior but constitutionally. That is, they feel their sexual orientation is not a matter of choice or even formed through interaction with their social environment, but something they were born with. Recently, there have been two studies that seem to confirm that claim, one by Swaab and Hofman and another by Simon LeVay. While both studies dealt with the hypothalamus of homosexual men, they were somewhat different. The Swaab and Hofman research studied the volume of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (hereafter referred to as SCN) in homosexual men. The SCN is a cell group located in the basal part of the brains of mammalians. It has been thought to be a principal component of the biological clock that generates and coordinates hormonal, physiological and behavioral body rhythms. Thus, it has been thought to have involvement in sex because of the varying body rhythms in sexual desire as well as the sexual changes that come with aging. The conclusion of this study is that “… the human hypothalamus revealed that the volume of the … SCN in homosexual men is 1.7 times as large as that of the reference group of male subjects and contains 2.1 times as many cells.”</p>
<p>Simon LeVay examined the anterior hypothalamus in the area that regulates male-type sexual behavior. Four cell groups, called INAH 1, 2, 3, 4, were studied. Postmortem tissue was measured from three subject groups: women, men presumed to be heterosexual, and homosexual men. LeVay found there were no differences in the volumes of INAH 1, 2 or 4. The INAH 3, however, was more than twice as large in heterosexual men as in women and homosexual men. Thus, LeVay concluded that there is a significant difference in the hypothalamus of heterosexual and homosexual men. He does caution that his results should be considered speculative. Moreover, the results of his study do not allow one to decide if the changes in the hypothalamus are the cause or consequences of an individual’s sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Many have concluded there is a genetic reason for homosexuality. Of course, this claim is extremely important to homosexuals for at least two reasons. First, if homosexuality is something innate or constitutional, then homosexuals are no more responsible for their sexual orientation than for eye color or height. Attempts to get homosexuals to change their sexual orientation will also be useless. Second, this claim has political ramifications. If there is a biological basis for homosexuality, then there will be pressure to grant them minority-rights status. This is a special civil rights status that would protect them from discrimination on the basis of their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>We must be cautious about what we conclude from these studies. It is wrong to conclude from these and other studies that no genetic factors go into the homosexual’s sexual orientation. On the other hand, it also concludes too much to think that these and similar studies show that homosexuality is constitutional and beyond change.  It goes far beyond the scientific evidence we presently possess to conclude that homosexuality is constitutional and cannot be changed.</p>
<p>If homosexuality is not simply a genetic or constitutional condition, what are its causes?   There is some evidence that family pathology at least contributes to homosexuality. About 67 percent of male homosexuals come from a home where the mother is a domineering man-hater and the father is weak, detached and often uninvolved in the family. However, it seems clear that this family structure is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition (by itself) for homosexuality. Homosexuality is the result of a variety of causes, none of which decisively determines sexual preference. There may be some biological factors which either predispose or contribute to homosexuality, and the home environment is also a significant factor. Still, in cases where all of these elements are present, one will not necessarily become a homosexual.  Even if we were to allow the position that there is a genetic “cause” for homosexuality, that does not mean that the behavior is allowable.  There are people with a genetic predisposition to violence (the double “Y” chromosome), but we do not allow them to act out that predisposition because such behavior is WRONG, even if it IS “in your genes”.   “God never speaks against homosexuality, Paul was just a homophobe.”</p>
<p><strong>GENESIS 19:1–11<br />
</strong>The sin of Sodom and Gomorrah has traditionally been taken to be homosexuality. In fact, another name for homosexuality is “sodomy.” The grossness of this sin was thought to be seen in the character of the judgment that God brought on these cities.  The traditional interpretation of this passage has been challenged in at least two ways by homosexuals. First, some have argued that if the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah was sexual, it was not simply homosexuality but homosexual rape.<br />
While it is true that the men of Sodom desired to rape the angelic visitors to their city, this interpretation is certainly wrong. Nowhere does the text even slightly hint that what the men of Sodom wanted to do would be permissible if only Lot’s guests had consented. Moreover, this interpretation does not account for the fact that God’s judgment fell upon two entire cities. Was homosexual rape a common practice and thus brought the judgment of God? It could have been, but such is not stated in the text. What is more damaging is that God’s judgment on homosexuality in Sodom and Gomorrah is quite in harmony with his prohibition and denunciation of this sin in other Scriptures properly interpreted. It is not as though this is the only time homosexuality is denounced and judged.</p>
<p>A second reinterpretation of Genesis 19 is even bolder, for it claims the passage is not about homosexuality at all.  Rather, the sin of Sodom and Gomorrah related to a gross violation of the hospitality code.  Those who believe in the inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture will be unpersuaded by the attempt to deny the genuineness of the 2 Peter and Jude passages. Jude gives a striking commentary on the sin of Sodom. It is called “going after strange or different flesh” (sarkos heteras), which is a way of describing unnatural sex acts. Jude uses the verb porneuo with the preposition ek, which means they gave themselves up to sexual immorality completely and utterly! This is an extremely strong statement. These kinds of sin make the complete destruction of the two cities understandable. We realize that arrogance and inhospitality are terrible sins, but they cannot explain the judgment of God in the destruction of two entire cities. </p>
<p><strong>LEVITICUS 18:22 AND 20:13</strong><br />
The next major statement in the OT about homosexuality is found in the Holiness Code, Lev 18:22 and 20:13. This Code contains God’s demands for ordering the life of his covenant people, Israel. This order had as its goal the setting apart of Israel from the immoral and idolatrous practices of her neighbors so that she might be acceptable to worship the true and living God.  In this Code are what appear to be two definite and direct prohibitions against homosexual acts. Lev 18:22 stands amidst legislation against all impermissible and unnatural sexual relationships. Lev 20:13 restates 18:22, and adds the death penalty for the practice. Both call the homosexual act an abomination (to’ebah, in Hebrew). These commands expand the Seventh Commandment. Their purpose is not exhaustive regulation of sexual activity, but prohibition of the most open and obvious offenses.</p>
<p>Nothing in Leviticus explicitly states why the prohibited practices are condemned. The Leviticus texts just naturally assume the practices are condemned because they are inherently wrong, not because they were part of the idolatrous worship of the Egyptians and Canaanites. In the Leviticus Code incest, adultery, child sacrifice, bestiality, spiritism and the cursing of one’s parents are all prohibited. Only one act condemned in the Code has cultic or symbolic significance—child sacrifice, and it is condemned whether associated with religious worship or not. Child sacrifice was practiced in pagan religious rites, but it was wrong on two counts—in itself and because of its association with idolatry.</p>
<p><strong>ROMANS 1:26–27<br />
</strong>When we turn to the NT, we find that it too condemns homosexuality. A passage that immediately comes to mind is Rom 1:26–27, as it seems to be the strongest condemnation of such actions. Rom 1:26 deals with lesbianism (homosexual relationships between women), while 1:27 treats male homosexuality. This is the only text in Scripture that mentions female homosexuality. This passage teaches that homosexual practices are evidences of God’s judgment on those who reject his revelation.  As we might expect, this interpretation of Paul’s teaching has been challenged.  However, Paul never claims that these words about homosexuality are his private opinions, and the OT passages already discussed show they are God’s views as well.  Homosexuality and lesbianism are condemned. Moreover, Paul states very clearly that homosexuality is God’s judgment (v. 26), a judgment that punishes those who reject the truth of God’s revelation about himself (vv. 25–26). In essence, Paul is saying that homosexuals are made, not born!</p>
<p><strong>1 CORINTHIANS 6:9–11 AND 1 TIMOTHY 1:8–10<br />
</strong>These two passages from Paul complete our study of the major biblical texts on this subject. We group 1 Cor 6:9–11 and 1 Tim 1:8–10 together because they both contain vice lists which include a similar word that bears on our present discussion. In 1 Cor 6:9–11 Paul talks about who will inherit the kingdom of God. He gives a list of vices and says that anyone who persists in these sins will not inherit the kingdom of God. In 1 Tim 1:8–10 the law is the subject, and Paul says it is good if used wisely. It is not for the righteous man but for the ungodly and sinners. He then describes in a vice list sins that the ungodly and sinners commit. </p>
<p>The response to these verses by pro-homosexual interpreters is that these actions are not singled out in these lists as being especially wicked, and if we were to take vice lists seriously, no one would enter into the kingdom of God, since we are all covetous.  Interpretations of this sort are really unsatisfactory. To say that a sin in a long list does not draw special condemnation does not mean Scripture approves the action. A vice list is still a vice list. Moreover, there is a failure to make a biblical distinction between a repentant sinner who seeks with God’s help to be free of some sin but who may at some time fail and an unrepentant sinner who follows a planned and uninterrupted course of disobedience. The vice lists refer to the latter, not the former. There is grace and forgiveness for the former, but not for the latter.</p>
<p>In summing up our discussion of biblical teaching on homosexuality, we note that Scripture does not say a lot about homosexuality. Possibly this is because it was not widespread in Jewish culture. However, we cannot escape the clear conviction that when Scripture does speak of it, it prohibits and condemns it. <br />
“When the Bible talks about homosexuality, it is talking about rape, not a committed, loving relationship.”<br />
Paul’s comment that “they burned in their lust for one another” is the key to understanding what he condemns (according to pro-homosexual commentators). Lust is wrong. Any sexual activity produced by lust is immoral, whether it is homosexual or heterosexual. The only moral sexual activity is that which grows out of love and devotion. Therefore, if homosexual acts are motivated by a sense of love, devotion and commitment, they are part of God’s design for human sexuality.</p>
<p>The problem with this interpretation is twofold. First, in view of how many partners male homosexuals typically have, promiscuity seems to be a usual part of male homosexuality. And it is highly dubious that those who are sexually promiscuous with hundreds of partners (as the figures show) act out of love, devotion and commitment to all of them! Second, the text does not say lustful homosexual acts are condemned by God. It says that because of homosexual acts God has given them over to this lust for one another. The lustful desire is a consequence of their sinful homosexual acts.<br />
 </p>
<p>“It’s okay because I love him/her, and God loves love.”</p>
<p>ALL forms of “love” that fall outside of God’s plainly stated boundaries; such as adultery, fornication, homosexuality/lesbianism, incest, sexual activity between close relatives, lustful thoughts, and so on, ARE NOT ALLOWABLE, no matter what the “emotional” desire for them might be.</p>
<p>God’s love is always balanced by His holiness, righteousness, and purity.  There can be no true love OUTSIDE of these parameters.</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 2:  EUTHANASIA</strong></p>
<p>EUTHANASIA.  It may be passive (stop treatment) or direct acts aimed at terminating life (active). The latter is wrong because it does not see God, as the taker of life Job 1:21; 38—41.</p>
<p><strong>CLARIFICATION OF TERMINOLOGY<br />
</strong>The term “euthanasia” is derived from two Greek words—eu meaning “well” or “good,” and thanatos meaning “death.” In contemporary discussions, it stands for a wide variety of practices. Terminology in regard to euthanasia can be divided into four different categories.</p>
<p><strong>VOLUNTARY/INVOLUNTARY<br />
</strong>This distinction focuses on whether or not the patient requests death. Voluntary euthanasia refers to cases where a patient requests death or grants permission to be put to death.  Euthanasia is involuntary when someone is put to death without requesting it or granting permission.</p>
<p><strong>ACTIVE/PASSIVE<br />
</strong>These terms focus on the kind of action taken to bring about death.  Active euthanasia refers to taking some purposeful action to end a life, whereas passive euthanasia refers to the withholding of treatment to sustain life.  Passive euthanasia may also involve withdrawing treatment already begun. Giving a lethal dose of drugs to someone diagnosed with AIDS is active euthanasia. Removal of a feeding tube is an example of passive euthanasia. </p>
<p><strong>DIRECT/INDIRECT<br />
</strong>These terms denote the role played by the person who dies when his life is taken. Direct euthanasia refers to cases where the individual himself carries out the decision to die. Indirect refers to situations where someone else carries out the decision.</p>
<p><strong>DEATH WITH DIGNITY, MERCY KILLING, AND DEATH SELECTION<br />
</strong>These terms focus on the ultimate intended goal to be achieved through the act of euthanasia. Death with dignity refers to allowing the patient to die a truly human death. Rather than using extraordinary means (such as hooking him up to a machine) to forestall death (which is said to dehumanize him), the patient is allowed to die “naturally.” Basic needs such as food and drink are met, but there is an attempt to avoid the dehumanizing effects of isolating a dying patient from family while making him little more than a body hooked up to a machine. Though this kind of euthanasia is often voluntary, rarely is it equated with suicide, since the patient is incurably ill and no medical procedure would heal him.</p>
<p>In mercy killing, the intent is to release someone who is suffering excruciating pain and has no other way of escape but death. It is seen as an act of mercy. Mercy killing may involve using medical technology to hasten or cause death, or it may involve using ordinary means to bring death.  </p>
<p>Whereas the goal with mercy killing is ostensibly the removal of individual pain and suffering, the goal with death selection is the deliberate removal of persons whose lives are no longer considered socially useful. People in this category need not be ill; they need only be deemed useless, a bother to society, expendable. This kind of euthanasia might fall on groups such as “hardened” criminals, the mentally retarded, or (as in Hitler’s Germany) whole ethnic or racial groups.</p>
<p><strong>A CHRISTIAN RESPONSE TO EUTHANASIA</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sanctity of Life Ethic<br />
</strong>Biblically speaking, human life is sacred. It is sacred because man is made in God’s image (Gen 1:26–27; 5:1).  Even someone severely deformed or wracked with pain from a terminal illness so that he cannot interact with his environment still bears the image of God. That alone suggests care in decision-making concerning such people.  Life is sacred as well because God has given it and sustains it. Because it is his gift, we must treat it with care and not discard it. To treat it lightly is a supreme act of ingratitude, but it also suggests that we think we own our life, when in fact God gave it and owns it. Christians have traditionally used this argument against suicide. It seems relevant as well to euthanasia in general, however, individual cases and circumstances may lead us to a conclusion that “heroic measures” to maintain life are not called for.  Finally, a further biblical indication of the sanctity of life is the prohibition against life-taking. Killing is condemned both in the OT (Exod 20:13) and the NT (Matt 5:21; 19:18; Mark 10:19; Luke 18:20; Rom 13:9). While there are exceptions to the rule (e.g., killing in self-defense, capital punishment, just war), what is unexceptional is the prohibition against the deliberate, intentional taking of innocent life.</p>
<p><strong>The Wedge Argument<br />
</strong>Sometimes referred to as the slippery slope argument, this argument warns against opening the door even to the seemingly most innocuous instances of euthanasia. Appeal is often made to what happened under the Nazis. They began with mercy killing in limited cases to relieve suffering, but later genocide eventuated. Once a country starts down the slope of killing, it gradually becomes more comfortable with euthanasia, and it becomes much easier to accustom people to even more inhumane and unwarranted killing.  Consider the effect of acceptable euthanasia in the Netherlands, where the number o f INVOLUNTARY acts of euthanasia is in the THOUSANDS per year.  When a culture accepts the “rightness” of killing someone who is not seen as socially “sustainable”, where does it stop?</p>
<p>The key to a wedge argument is the form or logic of moral justifications for actions. One might want to limit the breadth of the category of people who qualify for euthanasia, but once it is decided that certain people are to die, it is hard to find any logical grounds for keeping others alive. For example, if the category includes those lacking the dignity of human beings, this can include many not terminally ill, nor in pain, nor desirous of death. They may simply fail to meet some ambiguous standard of what it means to be human. Proponents of euthanasia invariably guarantee that it will be used only in rather narrowly defined cases. The wedge argument says that “there is no logical or easily agreed upon reason why the range of cases should be restricted”. The wedge argument assumes that killing is wrong generally and that there should be as few exceptions as possible to the command to preserve life.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Concerns</strong><br />
Several medical considerations should cause you to hesitate before encouraging euthanasia, and these need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. </p>
<p>First, a request to execute a natural-death directive may be based more on fear or misinformation than anything else. The patient may think their situation far worse than it actually is and ask to die. Once the patient dies, the mistake cannot be undone.</p>
<p>Second, a cure for a supposedly incurable disease may be found. Medical history is filled with examples of people thought to have an incurable disease who were later healed when medicine progressed.  Medical science advances very rapidly, but new cures cannot be offered to a dead person.</p>
<p>Third, those who think patients must choose between terrible suffering and relief through death have overlooked a third option. Even in terminal cases, modern medicine can provide measures sufficient to reduce pain to a bearable level or even remove it altogether. In most cases one need not choose death as the sole release from pain.<br />
A final medical matter relates to a doctor’s involvement in euthanasia. Many note that when a doctor takes the Hippocratic Oath, he promises to use medicine to help the sick and never to injure or wrong them. The doctor also promises never to give poison to anyone, even if asked to do so. Some claim the Oath no longer applies in our times, but those who think otherwise have serious problems in squaring the Oath with aiding euthanasia.</p>
<p><strong>Additional Biblical and Theological Concerns<br />
</strong>Value in Suffering<br />
Though suffering is neither enjoyable nor to be sought, that does not mean it cannot have any positive function in a person’s life. Rom 5:3–5, 1 Pet 1:6–9, 2 Cor 4:17, 12:10 and the book of Job, for example, speak of the potential benefits to be gained from suffering. While afflictions are evils, God can and does use them to work good in our lives. Suffering need not be seen as valueless, something to be escaped at all costs.</p>
<p><strong>Perspective on Life, Death and the Afterlife<br />
</strong>Initially, I must underscore biblical teaching that God is in control of life and death. The humanist may dislike it, but passages such as Job 14:5, Ecc 3:2, and Jas 4:13–15 teach that no one can add or detract even one second from his life beyond what God has decided. Moreover, those who try to extend life endlessly, regardless of the patient’s condition, are reminded by Ecc 3:2 that there is a time to be born and a time to die. Man’s manipulations cannot overturn God’s control.  The biblical perspective is that death is not natural; it entered the world as a result of sin (Gen 3:14–19; Rom 5:12). Moreover, the process of dying is itself often very painful, and Scripture does not portray it otherwise. Death is not a friend; it is the last enemy to be overcome (1 Cor 15:26).</p>
<p>Some think Paul forbids sorrow over death (1 Thess 4:13). However, he is not suggesting we should rejoice when someone dies. He only mandates that as believers grieve, they should not grieve as those who have no hope. This is hardly an endorsement of death. In fact, Paul sees the Christian’s hope not as a death which releases from suffering, but as resurrection to life which occurs at Christ’s return (1 Thess 4:13–18).</p>
<p>The biblical perspective on life, death, and the afterlife is incomplete without the teaching of the resurrection of the body. Scripture does not teach that death ends it all. Rather, it tells us that for believers and non-believers alike, following death there is conscious existence and eventually resurrection of the body (Luke 16:19ff.; Rom 8:18–20.; 1 Cor 15:20–23; 2 Cor 5:8; Rev 20:4–5, 11–15). Among other things, this means for the Christian that his ultimate hope for escaping pain and suffering is not physical death, but resurrection of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Other Concerns<br />
</strong>Two other considerations are noteworthy. Some emphasize that learning from affliction is not the only biblical alternative to euthanasia. The other is healing. There are even cases of dead people being resurrected (e.g., 1 Kgs 17:22; John 11; Acts 20:10). This does not mean anyone has a right to miraculous healing or that he should expect it. It does mean that we have a right to ask God to heal and then wait to see what he does.</p>
<p>Finally, what about biblical teaching to extend mercy to those in need? I would reply that mercy to the sick and dying does not include granting their wish to die. However, it does include proper care for their needs. Proper care includes giving drugs to relieve pain. Kerby Anderson appeals to Prov 31:6 as a moral    justification for giving pain-relieving drugs. He also cites Gal 6:2 to urge believers to provide counsel and spiritual care for dying patients.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION<br />
</strong>First, in all potential cases of death with dignity and mercy killing, it is crucial to consult the best medical opinion of a pro-life doctor and make decisions in light of his advice and the Holy Spirit’s leading.<br />
Second, despite the advances of modern medicine and regardless of how pro-life a doctor is, there will be cases where it is impossible to predict when a patient will die or what the outcome of a medical procedure will be. In such cases, our obligation is to do what is reasonable and moral to preserve life and relieve pain, and then leave the outcome in the hands of him who ultimately controls matters of life and death.<br />
Finally, though I believe the most acceptable view is that euthanasia is wrong in general, I do grant that some forms in some instances may be acceptable (or even necessary), given the specific circumstances. We must solicit divine guidance!</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 3:  ABORTION</strong><br />
Abortion and infanticide in the Bible<br />
<strong>Exodus 21:22-25<br />
</strong>22 “If men fight, and hurt a woman with child, so that she gives birth prematurely, yet no harm follows, he shall surely be punished accordingly as the woman’s husband imposes on him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. 23 But if any harm follows, then you shall give life for life, 24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 burn for burn, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</p>
<p><strong>Isaiah 44:2 (A)<br />
</strong>2 Thus says the LORD who made you And formed you from the womb, who will help you:</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 139:13-16<br />
</strong>13 For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb.<br />
14 I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvelous are Your works, And that my soul knows very well.  15 My frame was not hidden from You, When I was made in secret, And skillfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.  16 Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. And in Your book they all were written, The days fashioned for me, When as yet there were none of them.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Chronicles 28:1-3<br />
</strong>1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; and he did not do what was right in the sight of the LORD, as his father David had done. 2 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made molded images for the Baals. 3 He burned incense in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, and burned his children in the fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the LORD had cast out before the children of Israel.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 106:32-38<br />
</strong>32 They angered Him also at the waters of strife, So that it went ill with Moses on account of them; 33 Because they rebelled against His Spirit, So that he spoke rashly with his lips.  34 They did not destroy the peoples, Concerning whom the LORD had commanded them, 35 But they mingled with the Gentiles And learned their works; 36 They served their idols, Which became a snare to them.  37 They even sacrificed their sons And their daughters to demons,<br />
38 And shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 6:16-19<br />
</strong>16 These six things the LORD hates, Yes, seven are an abomination to Him: 17 A proud look, A lying tongue, Hands that shed innocent blood, 18 A heart that devises wicked plans, Feet that are swift in running to evil, 19 A false witness who speaks lies, And one who sows discord among brethren.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion:<br />
</strong>One of the most pressing moral problems of our day is abortion. It is the second most common surgical procedure in the U.S., circumcision being the first.  Since The Roe Vs Wade decision, as of this year, over 44 million abortions have been performed in the United States.</p>
<p>Prior to 1973, there were abortions in the U.S., but the Roe decision in essence legalized abortion on demand. That decision struck down existing laws against abortion, but did agree that the government still has a legitimate interest in protecting fetal life. Still, the way the decision was written and interpreted essentially abrogated any governmental ability to stop abortion.</p>
<p>Induced abortions are commonly what we think of when we hear people talk about abortions.<br />
This class of abortions is characterized by outside or external intervention into the reproductive process with a view to terminating pregnancy. There are several kinds of induced abortions. Therapeutic abortions are performed to save the mother’s life. Because of the present state of medicine, such abortions are rare. Ectopic or tubal pregnancies are examples. In this kind of pregnancy the fertilized egg does not implant in the uterus but in the fallopian tube. Only two options are open to the doctor. Either he intervenes to take the baby’s life in order to save the mother’s life, or both baby and mother die. Another potential cause of therapeutic abortion is maternal heart disease. At one time women with heart disease were at risk in full-term pregnancies. However, that is almost never the case today. The most common candidates for therapeutic abortions are pregnant women with cancer (especially uterine cancer). If treatment of the cancer requires either radiation or chemotherapy, that will likely kill the baby. Hence, it must be decided whether to delay treatment until the birth of the baby, or begin it immediately and risk losing the child.</p>
<p>Eugenic abortions are a second category of induced abortions. They are performed to abort a fetus that has or is at risk for some physical and/or mental handicap such as Down’s syndrome. The most typical method of determining such problems is a procedure called amniocentesis. Amniocentesis cannot be performed until around the fourth month of pregnancy, since it requires the development of the placental sac and its fluid. A needle is inserted into the sac, and fluid is removed and examined to determine any abnormalities. Amniocentesis is very good at determining problems such as Down’s, but it has two limitations. There is a very small group of diseases that it can detect, and it cannot be performed until relatively late in the pregnancy. However, as other techniques for detecting problems are developed for the first trimester, eugenic abortions will probably increase, particularly since some doctors pressure parents to abort a child where there is the slightest risk of any handicap. For instance, some diseases are gender specific. Sickle-cell anemia is a disease only males get. So, if a family is at risk and the baby is a male, there will be great pressure to abort this child on eugenic grounds.</p>
<p>Finally, elective abortions complete the category of induced abortions. Here the mother’s life is not threatened, and there is no known risk of physical and/or mental handicap for the child. The reason for abortion is simply the convenience of the parents (e.g., control of family size, physical and/or mental strain on the parents, or financial hardship on the family). Moreover, as it becomes easier to choose the sex of a child, families can choose a gender specific child and abort those of the “wrong” sex.</p>
<p><strong>Can A Fetus Feel?<br />
</strong>Let’s look at the question about whether the baby undergoing abortion feels any pain. Certain conditions necessary for the existence of pain are known to exist in the developing fetus. They are 1) functioning neurological structures to sense pain; 2) overt behavior expressive of pain; and 3) a cause for pain. Dr. A. W. Liley, a respected professor of fetal psychology at the National Women’s Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand, has demonstrated that an eleven-week-old fetus can experience pain and responds to touch, light, heat and noise. Liley has shown through the use of closed-circuit television cameras that such a child will feel pain when pricked with a needle. Moreover, if a beep is used before the prick several times, the baby will recoil at the beep alone. But this is within the first trimester of pregnancy, and during that time D &amp; C and suction are the methods of abortion most commonly used. Moreover, though this is late in the first trimester of pregnancy, it must be remembered that most women do not even know they are pregnant until the second month of pregnancy, and once they know, they are not likely to get an abortion immediately. They will consider it for a while. All of this, of course, gives the fetus more time to develop and only helps to ensure that it will likely feel pain if it undergoes an abortion.</p>
<p>If the baby can respond to pain during the first trimester of development, it is obvious that it feels pain during the second. But during that second trimester saline injection is used for abortion. Undoubtedly, the baby feels very vividly the pain from that procedure. By the final trimester of pregnancy, the baby’s nervous system and ability to experience sensations is not much different, if at all, from a newborn baby. If it would hurt a newborn to starve it or kill it by some other deliberate action, then surely the baby aborted during this period feels significant pain. So, contrary to what proponents of abortion claim, when a mother aborts her baby, most likely the baby feels great pain.</p>
<p><strong>The Matter Of Choice<br />
</strong>The mother’s pregnancy is usually with her implied or explicit consent through engaging in intercourse. That is, whenever a woman consents to sexual intercourse, she must understand that she is consenting, explicitly or implicitly, to becoming pregnant if that should eventuate. Adult privileges and pleasures include adult responsibilities!</p>
<p><strong>What about the difficult cases?<br />
</strong>First, in light of advances in medical technology, the actual number of cases where the life of either mother or baby must be sacrificed is very small indeed. Second, abortion to save the mother’s life has been called therapeutic abortion. In the current discussions on abortion the meaning of “therapeutic” has been expanded to cover anything that affects the well-being of the mother. This now includes whether she is depressed at the thought of having another child or whether having a child fits in with her career goals. That is not truly THERAPEUTIC ABORTION! The only therapeutic abortions are those where the mother’s life is genuinely endangered, and it is impossible to save both her life and the life of the baby.  If this situation DOES arise, it must be handled on an individual basis with much prayer and counsel.</p>
<p>Eugenic abortions are not moral. Even where death is inevitable, we have no right to take someone’s life. Life and death are in God’s hands, not man’s. Moreover, how we treat those in this state will influence our attitude more generally to the sanctity of life. A society that permits the abortion of handicapped children prenatally can easily become a society that finds reasons to terminate the lives of others who are undesirable for some other reason. The taking of innocent life is forbidden by God’s word. Obeying that prohibition is right, and it also seems a reasonable price to pay even in these cases in order to uphold the broader goal of respect for life.<br />
In rape and incest we again confront extreme examples. Rape and incest are some of the most horrible sexual crimes imaginable. They often result in great physical and psychological harm to the victim. Add to that the fact that in incest there is the possibility for a severely handicapped baby, because the parents are so closely related genetically. Are we to add to the already enormous burdens rape or incest places on a victim the responsibility to bear a child from this union and to care for him or her until maturity?</p>
<p>As to arguments against abortion in cases of rape and incest, an initial argument is that it is never right to do evil to achieve good. Put another way, two wrongs do not make a right. While rape and incest are horrible acts, so is abortion. Second, while rape and incest are acts of violence against the mother, so is abortion. Third, aborting a fetus conceived by rape or incest makes the baby a victim of the crime as well. The mother is already a victim of this crime; abortion only adds another. Fourth, it is never right to commit murder to alleviate suffering. Abortion is murder, like it or not, and in this case it is committed to alleviate the pain of the mother. Fifth, to demand that the mother bear the child is not to lack compassion. Harm, both physical and psychological, may come to the mother who aborts in the situation, so there is concern for her. However, to terminate the life of an unborn child certainly shows no compassion for him or her. We have a right, so it is argued, to require the mother to give birth to the child, and if she cannot bear to care for it, she should give it up for adoption. Sixth, it is wrong to force someone to do something they have no duty to do. No one is obligated to lay his or her life down for another’s life, much less for some lesser benefit. Therefore, it is wrong to force someone to do so. But that is exactly what the baby is asked to do. We are asking the unborn child, conceived by rape or incest, to forfeit life in order to ameliorate the mother’s pain.  Finally, conception in cases of rape is very rare. The reasons are many. The emotional trauma of the act may prevent ovulation, the offender may experience impotence, or the woman may use contraceptives or be in her infertile period of the month. It is estimated that .06 of 1 percent of all abortions are for rape. Undoubtedly, the numbers are low because some who become pregnant from rape decide not to abort. Still, it is safe to say that the main reason figures are low is that most rape victims don’t get pregnant.</p>
<p>It is also a highly unproven fact that abortion in such cases ends or even lessens the suffering of the mother. David Reardon’s book, Aborted Women: Silent No More, is the most extensive study of the long term effects on women of their decision to have an abortion. This book is the result of extensive research and of a detailed survey of 252 women who had abortions and are now members of WEBA (Women Exploited by Abortion). From this research Reardon found that over 95 percent would not now have chosen abortion, and that 66 percent feel they are now worse off than they would have been had they not had an abortion. These are truly surprising findings, but they should be tempered a bit because of two factors. First, it is not clear that these women had abortions for rape or incest. Second, the fact that they are members of WEBA makes them an atypical sample of all women who have had abortions. Still, the findings do underscore our general point that it is not clear that an abortion solves all the problems for a woman. It may solve some, but engenders others.</p>
<p>Finally, it is possible even in cases of rape or incest to prevent conception, and I believe this is the course of action that should be taken. There is a period of time between intercourse and conception, and, if estrogen treatment is given, conception can be prevented. In a Minnesota hospital 3,500 rape victims received treatment without one becoming pregnant. In Buffalo, New York, there was not one pregnancy from rape in thirty years, and in Washington, D. C., a study of over three hundred rapes showed only one pregnancy.  Hence, it seems possible to reduce dramatically the number of rape and incest cases where the question of abortion would even arise. In those cases where it does arise, however, we see no morally acceptable reason for demanding the forfeiture of the baby’s life.</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION:<br />
</strong>Abortion is the taking of an innocent human life.  While there may be the OCCASIONAL need to look at the issue of saving the mothers life or the baby’s; over 99% of the abortions performed today are for reasons of CONVENIENCE only, and are thus murder.  We have shed more innocent blood on the “altar of convenience” than the pagan peoples of Canaan ever shed to Moloch.  How can we expect God to bless our nation when we continue to do that which is evil in His sight?</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 4:  DIVORCE</strong></p>
<p><strong>BIBLICALLY, WHAT CONSTITUTES A  MARRIAGE?<br />
</strong>Though Paul teaches about Christian marriage (Ephesians 5), he focuses more on how husbands and wives should relate to one another than on what forms a marriage. Thus, this question seems best answered by appeal to the creation ordinances in Genesis 2. Genesis 2 shows that marriage is God’s idea (2:18). After God created the world and the first man, he decided man should not be alone. God created the animals, and Adam named them, but none was suitable as a helper for Adam (2:19–20). God then created Eve from Adam and brought her to him (2:21–22). Verse 23 records Adam’s words of recognition that she was the one suitable to be his helper. The passage ends (v. 24) by setting forth the elements that go into making a marriage in God’s eye.</p>
<p>Verse 24 states that because ( “for this reason”) a man recognizes a particular woman as suitable to be his mate, he leaves father and mother. The word for leave (’azab) is a very strong word that means more than simple departure. It means “to forsake, leave destitute, or refuse.” The idea is not that a husband and wife no longer can have any relationship with their parents. Rather, they recognize that their relationship to one another must have priority over all other ties. It is in this sense that they forsake or leave their parents.</p>
<p>Marriage also involves a cleaving to one’s mate. The word for cleave (dabaq) means “to cling to, remain close, adhere, be glued firmly.” In this verse it means that once parents are forsaken, the man will not soon return to them. He will stay with his wife and direct his affection and attention to her. She will do the same to him. When the ideas of forsaking and clinging are taken together, it becomes clear that marriage amounts to each partner committing his/her life to the other. It is a pledge to emphasize one’s mate as paramount beyond all other relations (forsaking) and to remain faithful to (cling to) him/her.</p>
<p>The verse concludes by saying they will become one flesh. This speaks of union. The point is not that now there is only one person. Eve still had her own body and mind, as did Adam. Likewise, the phrase is not merely a reference to the sexual union of the partners.  The phrase is a metaphor meant to signify the bonding or uniting of the two as a married couple. The sex act outwardly and physically points to the bond that has been created.</p>
<p>How is this union brought about? It comes into being as a result of two factors. The first is the commitment of life to one another, signified by the forsaking and cleaving of the partners to one another. The second is an act of God constituting or uniting them together. Jesus’command in Matt 19:6 not to put asunder those whom God has joined emphasizes the divine element in establishing the bond.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT DOES THE BIBLE SAY?<br />
</strong>The divine ideal for marriage is clearly a lifelong bond that unites husband and wife in a “one flesh” relationship (Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:5). The marriage union is a holy condition founded by God and is not to be dissolved at the will of human beings (Matt. 19:6). Separations of this bond displease God and pose a serious threat to the social order: “And let none deal treacherously with the wife of his youth. For the LORD God of Israel says that He hates divorce, for it covers one’s garments with violence” (Mal. 2:15–16).</p>
<p>The Law of Moses allowed a man to divorce his wife when she found “no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her” (Deut. 24:1). The primary purpose of this legislation was to prevent him from taking her again after she had married another man—“an abomination before the LORD” (Deut. 24:4).</p>
<p>This law was intended to discourage, rather than encourage, divorce. A public document known as a “certificate of divorce” was granted the woman. This permitted her the right to remarry without civil or religious sanction. Divorce could not be done privately.  This stricture of divorce hinged on the fact that the Mosaic Law called for severe penalties for certain types of “uncleanness.” Adultery carried the death penalty by stoning for the woman. If a man believed that his wife was not a virgin when he married her, he could have her judged by the elders of the city. If they found her guilty, she could be put to death (Deut. 22:13–21).  Thus, if a man divorced his wife, but did not bring an accusation of adultery against her, the stigma of the divorce lay on HIM, not the woman.  It would be very difficult for the man to find a woman whose family would accept him after this, so his chances of re-marrying were slim.</p>
<p>In Jesus’ day, confusion prevailed about the grounds for divorce. Even the rabbis could not agree on what constituted the “uncleanness” of Deuteronomy 24:1. Followers of Rabbi Shammai felt adultery was the only grounds for divorce. Those who followed Rabbi Hillel accepted many reasons, including such things as poor cooking.</p>
<p>The gospels record four statements by Jesus concerning divorce. In two of these He allowed divorce in the case of adultery. In Matthew 5:32 Jesus commented on the situation of both the woman and her new husband: “Whoever divorces his wife for any reason except sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery; and whoever marries a woman who is divorced commits adultery.”</p>
<p>In another statement, Jesus described the position of the man who divorced his wife: “Whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery” (Matt. 19:9). While these two statements seem to allow divorce because of unfaithfulness, two other statements of Jesus appear to make no provision for divorce (Mark 10:11–12; Luke 16:18).</p>
<p>Are Jesus’ statements allowing divorce for infidelity in conflict with biblical statements that seem to forbid it entirely? Jesus’ statements in Mark and Luke were made in conversations with Pharisees about the Mosaic Law, which they believed allowed divorce on grounds other than adultery (Deut. 24:1–4). Jesus’ main point in these statements was that divorce is contrary to God’s plan for marriage and should never be taken lightly. Even though Moses allowed divorce, this was an exception granted under the law because of their “hardness” of heart (Mark 10:5). Jesus desired to put “teeth” into the Law by declaring that, even if the divorced couple had not been sexually unfaithful to each other, they would commit adultery in God’s sight if they now married other partners.</p>
<p>In allowing divorce for the single reason of “immorality,” or illicit sexual intercourse, Jesus’ thought is clearly that a person dissolves his marriage by creating a sexual union with someone other than the marriage partner. Such union violates the sacred “oneness” intended by God when he united Adam and Eve in the first marriage relationship (Gen. 2:18–25).</p>
<p>In the case of sexual unfaithfulness, the decree of divorce simply reflects the fact that the marriage has already been broken. A man divorcing his wife for this cause does not “make her an adulteress,” for she already is one. Thus, divorce on the grounds of unchastity usually frees the innocent partner to remarry without incurring the guilt of adultery (Matt. 19:9). However, although Jesus allowed divorce for adultery, He did not require it. On the contrary, He insisted that divorce disrupts God’s plan for marriage and left the way open for repentance and forgiveness.</p>
<p>Paul was essentially in agreement with Jesus’ teachings on marriage and divorce. However, the apostle dealt with new situations involving the marital conflict between believers and between a believer and an unbeliever.</p>
<p>In the case of two Christians, Paul admonished them to follow the Lord’s teachings and be reconciled. In any event, neither is to marry another (1 Cor. 7:10–11). In 1 Corinthians 7:15, Paul says that a Christian whose mate has abandoned the marriage should be free to formalize the divorce: “If the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases.” Many authorities hold that the phrase “not under bondage” means that a deserted Christian spouse may lawfully go from divorce to remarriage.</p>
<p><strong>THE BASIS FOR MODERN DIVORCE PROBLEMS</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Marrying the wrong person.  In modern times, even within the Church, we think that we are wise enough to choose our own spouse, based on emotion only.  We think that an emotional response based on physical attractiveness, “coolness”, or availability is true “love”.  We don’t focus on letting God choose our spouse for us, keeping this as a matter of prayer, and waiting patiently for HIM to bring the right one to us.</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> Marrying without godly counsel.  So many couples marry without receiving any pre-marital counseling of any kind.  They enter into marriage thinking that it is nothing more than glorified dating.  They have no skills in communication, finances, marital roles, and so on.  Thus, they are unprepared for the stresses of marriage, finance, and child-rearing.</p>
<p><strong>C.</strong> Marrying in sin.  Many couples now-days marry after having either sleeping together, or fully living together.  God’s blessing does not rest on relationships that are formed in unrepentant sin.</p>
<p><strong>D.</strong> Marrying without commitment.  Because of the ease of modern legal divorces, and the absence of any stigma within the majority of the church, modern marriages are formed without any real sense of life-long commitment.  Since there is no real commitment, the tendency is to “bail out” when the troubles and stresses come, or when another “newer” or “better” relationship is formed with someone else.</p>

<strong>INTRODUCTION:<br />
</strong>The Church in the United States in the 21st century finds itself in an interesting (and potentially dangerous) position.  Although there is tremendous growth in some areas of what is commonly called the Church, at the same time there is a tremendous falling away from what the BIBLE describes as the Church (teaches true repentance, holds to sound doctrine, emphasizes holy living, etc.).  The growth of “mega-churches”, the appearance of an increasing number of specialty “needs ministries”, and the “shopping mall mentality” (including the ones who recently added coffee-shops or fast-food courts to their buildings) of a number of churches has brought people of all kinds into the doors by the busload.  However, at the same time, there have been numerous reports of Biblical illiteracy among the “church folks”, and the level of various social problems such as divorce, out-of-wedlock pregnancies, spouse abuse, the use of pornography (via Internet, or other means) and so on is at approximately the same levels as it is in the world outside of the church. </p>
<p>When this information is coupled with what the Bible says will happen in the church during what is commonly known as “the latter days”, or “the end times”, we begin to see that the church is splitting into two groups, and that there will come a time when these two groups will no longer be able to co-exist in peace.  As this process of separation continues, the “church of the world” will gain in adherents and in public acceptance, while the “church of the remnant” will be forced out of the public arena just as it was in the early days of the church, when the believers who refused to accept the Roman Emperor as a deity were forced to meet in the catacombs.  This “church of the remnant” will become what is known in other countries (where believers are already experiencing the persecution of Biblical Christians) as “the underground church”.</p>
<p>As this occurs, it will become evident that our current church “forms” and ways of doing things won’t be adequate to meet the needs of the underground Christians.  We will have to learn the lessons of the early Christians, and of the Christians who even today are facing persecution and public opposition to their simple desire to worship Christ and tell people of the Gospel of salvation.  That is the purpose of this material.  It is my hope that we can learn to be “more than conquerors” in the times to come, and that the true Church of Jesus Christ will continue to minister the Gospel in spite of the world’s opposition.  I want to express my heartfelt appreciation to those who have addressed this subject in the past, who have had a profound influence on my thinking. </p>
<p><strong>The Philosophy And Purpose Of The Underground Church:<br />
</strong>What is the philosophy and purpose of the underground church, particularly as it relates to the United States in what is popularly termed the “latter days”, or “end times”?  The philosophy of the underground church should be absolute obedience to God’s Word, and to the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  It is not a philosophy of violence, a quest for political power and influence, a desire for ease, or an attempt to “win friends and influence people”.  It is a philosophy that understands that the sufferings of this world are a natural product of sin, and that the children of God will ALWAYS be seen as different and undesirable to those who walk in darkness.  The underground church understands that persecution and suffering for the cause of Christ is not a new thing, but is rather the normal lot of each generation that seeks to serve the Lord above all else.  This philosophy will play itself out in the developed theology of the underground church, which will be expanded upon in the next chapter.</p>
<p>What is the purpose of the underground church?  It is the same purpose that has driven the true church in each generation.  To teach and preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ that was once delivered to the saints; to promote holy living, obedience and submission to God in every aspect of life; and to build each other up by fellowship and prayer.  Another aspect of the underground church is to provide a means for its’ members to survive as much as possible in times of persecution and hardship.  Since the people of the underground church are all “family” in a very real sense, they will not only edify (build up, or strengthen) each other spiritually, but assist each other physically.  This can take many forms, including provision of food, medicines, or other supplies; hiding members who are being sought by the authorities; passing vital information back and forth; and so on.  The last two chapters of this paper will develop these themes more fully.</p>
<p><strong>THE FUNCTION AND THEOLOGY OF THE UNDERGROUND CHURCH<br />
</strong>The function of the Church can be summed up in the following ministries:<br />
• To teach Scripture;<br />
•  To hold members accountable to Scripture;<br />
•   To expose and warn against false teachings and teachers;<br />
•  To evangelize the lost;<br />
•  To provide fellowship;<br />
•  To provide opportunities for cor¬porate worship;<br />
•  To pray for one another;<br />
•  To bear one another’s burdens;<br />
•  To minister to those in need spiri¬tually and temporally.</p>
<p><strong>TO TEACH SCRIPTURE<br />
</strong>Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have com¬manded you: and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen. (Matthew 28:19-20)</p>
<p>The teaching ministry is to be in the hands of men who hold Scripture in the highest regard. It isn’t enough to be¬lieve that God’s Word is inerrant and wholly inspired by the Holy Spirit; a teacher of God’s Word must avoid inte¬grating with Scripture other theological “truths” found in human philosophies.</p>
<p><strong>TO HOLD ACCOUNTABLE TO SCRIPTURE<br />
</strong>Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you. (Hebrews 13:17)</p>
<p>It is one thing to teach God’s Word; it is another thing to hold the people accountable to what has been taught. The Church has no business holding its members accountable to anything other than the Bible. The reason for the scan¬dals that followed the shepherding movement was that the shepherds were intruding into areas of personal living that were outside their rightful domain.  Unfaithful shepherds will either abuse the flock by demanding obedi¬ence to dictates not found in God’s Word, or will neglect the flock by not holding them strictly to the demands of God’s Word. Either way, they are failing those whom God has entrusted to their care. </p>
<p>The proper approach to account¬ability will provide a loving but firm hand upon those entrusted to the church’s leadership. The process will include—both corporately and indi¬vidually—instruction in righteousness according to Scripture. It will include encouragement to remain faithful to God’s Word, exhortation to take a stand for God’s Word, and reproof and re¬buke for not adhering to God’s Word. It will also include discipline when needed as a consequence for not obey¬ing God’s Word.</p>
<p>Finally, it will require exposure and even dis-fellowshipping for rebelling against correction meant to bring one into conformity to God’s Word.  Those who refuse correction after one or two admonitions are to be re¬moved from the fellowship (Titus 3:10). This doesn’t leave much room for bear¬ing with rebellion. But leadership must be sure that the thing to which they are demanding obedience is clearly stated in God’s Word, and is not based upon tradition or theological biases.  It is extremely important, however, to stress that genuine love and concern for a brother’s soul must be the basis for all discipline. Let those who would im¬pose such discipline examine them¬selves first to see if they are not condemning a brother for their own sins.</p>
<p><strong>TO EXPOSE AND WARN AGAINST FALSE TEACHINGS AND TEACHERS<br />
</strong>For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.  Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.  Therefore watch, and remem¬ber, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. (Acts 20:29-31)</p>
<p>Many Christians are critical of those who expend time and effort to ex¬pose false teachings both inside and outside of the Church. They insist that we are only to preach the Gospel and not judge others; the Holy Spirit will do that. But if this were true, false teach¬ings would not proliferate as they have throughout the centuries. The ecclesias¬ticism that characterizes most churches would not exist today; cults would not so easily spring up to lure people away from the truth.<br />
To hold to the position that the Church is only to preach the Gospel and not expose error contrary to the Gospel is to fail to preach the whole Gospel. It looks at the Gospel as only conveying the message of salvation through the blood of Christ, without re¬gard to the rest of Scripture’s instruc¬tions. In effect, it births souls into the Kingdom of God, but doesn’t nurture them or protect them from danger, which any good parent would do for their child. What good parent would give birth, and then leave it up to God to take care of their child’s welfare, re¬fusing to feed it, clothe it, or instruct it on the dangers of life?  Yet that is what many pastors do with those under their care. They avoid the controversy of confronting spiritual error, and do not employ scriptural dis¬cipline for fear of losing members.</p>
<p>If there were ever a time in history that the Church must warn against false teachings and false teachers, this is that time. And it is in keeping with scrip¬tural prophecy that as we approach the end of this age evil will wax worse, and false prophets will proliferate:  And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?<br />
And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</p>
<p>For many shall come in my name, saying, l am Christ; and shall deceive many.  And ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.  All these are the beginning of sorrows.  Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.  And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.  And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.  And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.  But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved. (Matthew 24:3-13)</p>
<p>Almost all of the New Testament writers warned of deception and urged the brethren to put up their guards. De¬fense of the Faith is as important to spiritual life in the Church as defense against wolves is to the shepherd guarding his flock. It is important that everyone with knowledge of error—es¬pecially the shepherds of God’s flock—warn the people against error and earnestly contend for the Faith Jude 3).</p>
<p>We often categorize sins according to how we perceive their relative evil. Yet Scripture places among these despi¬cable sins “any other thing that is con¬trary to sound doctrine.” If men will preach against other evils, why do they not preach against false doctrine?</p>
<p>We see that the Scriptures have much to say about teaching and adhering to sound doc¬trine. But this is only possible if sound doctrine is contrasted with false doc¬trine, much of which sounds scriptural to the unlearned. This, without a doubt, would require that pastors study hard to keep up with the various winds of doctrine that are affecting their charges through the Christian media and else¬where. They must know what the en¬emy is saying so they can counter the error with sound doctrine. Naiveté and ignorance do not excuse those whose life work is serving God’s people.</p>
<p><strong>TO EVANGELIZE THE LOST<br />
</strong>But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry. (II Timothy 4:5)</p>
<p>All believers are called to be wit¬nesses and to evangelize the lost, and there are those gifted with evangelistic fervor who may or may not hold the of¬fice of evangelist.  There is a place for mass evangel¬ism as evidenced by Scripture (Acts 2:41; 4:4). But during times of persecu¬tion, mass evangelism will not be practi¬cal (unless somehow the Holy Spirit accomplishes it).  One-on-one evangelism is still the mainstay of the ministry. Our personal witness carries much weight when com¬bined with God’s Word.  Yet every fellowship should have an evangelist among the eldership. The evangelist primarily concerns himself with the lost who are brought into the fellowship to be witnessed to.  This does not mean that the evan¬gelist may not also function as a pastor, teacher, apostle or prophet. But it is primarily he who should confront the un¬believer and offer him an opportunity to surrender his life to Christ. This is a gift often neglected in the modern churches where confrontation is often avoided at all costs. In most churches evangelization is limited to missionary work outside the fellowship—often in foreign countries.</p>
<p>While missionary work is an im¬portant aspect of a church’s ministry, it does not meet the immediate need to present the Gospel to unbelievers in its midst. These are usually left with an ap¬peal from the pulpit to “come to Jesus” so He can alleviate their troubles. And while He does often alleviate our trou¬bles, that is an erroneous premise upon which to base the Gospel message.  It is important that people be made aware of their sinful nature and their inability to please God with their works apart from faith in Jesus Christ.  Bringing someone to church in the hope that something said from the pul¬pit will cause them to “accept Christ” is, at best, a weak attempt at evangeliza¬tion. It exposes the unbeliever to a ge¬neric gospel that may or may not convict him of sin and lead him to re¬pentance.  Most appeals in the churches to “accept Christ” focus on the benefits of salvation without mention of the conse¬quences of following Christ: tribula¬tions, rejection by friends and family, loss of jobs, ridicule by former associ¬ates with whom they had engaged in sinful activities, persecution and possi¬ble torture and death for the sake of the Gospel.</p>
<p>There are those who believe that counting the cost must come after one is convinced to follow the Lord due to the preaching of his need for Christ. After he makes the commitment he must be told to count the cost.  Others believe that he must first be convinced of his need to surrender to Christ, but before he is encouraged to make a commitment he should be told of the consequences.</p>
<p>This latter position is based on the belief that the former position might cause one to violate his stated commit¬ment, which could bring a greater judg¬ment upon him. In either case, Jesus Himself tells us to count the cost before choosing to follow Him:  If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.  And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple.  For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it?  Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.  Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand?  Or else, while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace.  So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple.<br />
Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned?<br />
It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. (Luke 15:25-35)</p>
<p>Jesus never made it easy to follow Him—certainly not as easy as those who preach today’s incomplete gospel appear to make it.  To ignore the consequences of following Christ as a disciple—not merely as a “Christian”—is to defraud the lis¬tener. What lies behind the watered-down gospel is a fear of rejection and a desire to just “get them in the door” and let the Holy Spirit take it from there.  By God’s mercy, some do enter that way and become strong disciples of the Lord.  But that does not negate the cow¬ardice of the preacher or absolve him of responsibility for failing to present the true Gospel in its entirety.</p>
<p>People new to the gathering must be asked by the elders what they be¬lieve and why they believe it. New members must be given time to prove their faithfulness to Christ and to the brethren before being asked to minister. Too often new people are placed into leadership based on perceived “spiritual gifts” (in reality merely natural talents).  If the people are truly humble and possess the other characteristics of the fruit of the Spirit they will submit to the requirement of testing their faith. If they do not wish to submit to it, or if they insist they are qualified to minis¬ter, they are, in fact, not qualified and must be instructed of that fact.</p>
<p>Most churches operate on an “open door policy,” publicly inviting everyone to join them in their services. The idea is to reach the unchurched and increase the membership roles. This policy is ac¬ceptable for evangelistic ministry and for the synagogue or teaching center, which most of today’s churches are. But it reflects an improper understanding of the Church’s primary purpose.</p>
<p>The Church is the family of God. It is meant to be a closed community wherein the brethren gather to share their common Faith. To open its doors to all corners invites a weakening of the fam¬ily structure. It places more importance upon unbelievers who think they are Christians than it does upon the family of God itself. For the Underground Church it could be dangerous.</p>
<p>All sorts of ungodly elements come through the doors of the churches. This results in corruption of the body of be¬lievers. Transients are not held account¬able for the errors they introduce among the congregants, or for their per¬sonal sins which remain secret for lack of familiarity between them and the eld¬ership. As a result, God’s people are found worshipping Him in the company of heathens. Although some churches practice “closed communion,” making the elements available only for mem¬bers, many offer them at the discretion of the recipients rather than on the basis of known fellowship in the Spirit.  By transients I am not referring only to those who visit on occasion; many long-standing members are tran¬sients in that they do not submit to the authority of the church, or do not wish to be active participants within the body of believers. Nor is the eldership in an open-door-policy church inclined to hold the people accountable. But, then, how can they if they don’t know the people?</p>
<p>This does not mean that a totally closed-door policy should be followed. It merely means that, ideally, anyone outside the body who would come into the congregation should be brought by invitation of a member of that body. If the person is unsaved, the purpose must be to expose that person to the Gospel on a personal level, ministered by those qualified to relate the Gospel and explain the consequences of turn¬ing to Christ for salvation. Any open-door policy should be according to the discretion of the eldership as they see the purpose and consider the conse¬quences of that policy.</p>
<p>Because of today’s easy-believism preached from corrupt pulpits, and the haste to promote people, the churches are filled with backsliders, malcontents, re¬bellious, argumentative and disrespectful wives and children, and sin of every sort.  Because the pure Word of God has been blended with human wisdom, a sense of holiness and fear toward God are lacking. And without fear of God, wisdom is lacking (Psalm 111:10).  Because wisdom is lacking, the people are falling into snares, and spiri¬tual death is raising a stench in the nos¬trils of God (Proverbs 10:21).<br />
In every good sense, the Body of Christ is to be separated from the world’s evils while at the same time living in the world as salt and light. But if the salt has lost its savor&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>TO PROVIDE FELLOWSHIP<br />
</strong>And let us consider one an¬other to provoke unto love and to good works:<br />
Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. (Hebrews 1024-25)</p>
<p>Strength is found in numbers. The Lord knows our need to be among those of like mind in the Faith. For the most part the believer’s time is spent in the world, being bombarded by sensual am peals to his fleshly appetites. Even nor¬mal day-to-day activities take their toll. It is imperative that we receive strength from one another so that we may be able to stand in the day of trial and tempta¬tion. In fact, almost every day is a day of trial and temptation, often bringing sor¬row and/or pain in some form.</p>
<p>Fellowship in the Body of Christ al¬lows for the bearing of one another’s burdens; it allows for opportunities to have doubts quelled, questions an¬swered, and godly fellowship built.  If we are in constant close fellow¬ship with the saints we are less likely to succumb to temptations; our conscience will not allow for godly conversation in the midst of personal guilt, and we will not want that conflict to exist. The pres¬ence of godly people helps godly peo¬ple. Fellowship with ungodly people will corrupt (I Corinthians 15:33).</p>
<p>It is not enough to fellowship for a few hours during and after a church service. Fellowship must be engaged in on a consistent basis. The first-century Church gathered daily in different homes to hear the Word of God, and to fellowship with one another.  The early Church custom of com¬bining the gathering for worship, praise and teaching, along with a corporate meal and hours of fellowship on the Sabbath (and even daily), was replaced by ecclesiastical services which relied upon clerics for intercession and all par¬ticipation. Eventually choirs took the place of spontaneous contribution of song by the congregants. The mass took the place of the community meal, and the priests’ sermons took the place of preaching and teaching by the elders.</p>
<p>In most cases Protestantism shook off the priesthood by name, but re¬tained the clergy-laity concept. The peo¬ple were allowed to sing, but only at the behest of sanctioned worship leaders and often only in concert with the choir. The communion, while not the idola¬trous ritual of Roman Catholicism, is still administered by the pastor who blesses the bread and the cup. The cor¬porate meal is seldom found in most churches except on special occasions such as holiday celebrations.</p>
<p>Ideally, the gathering together should have no time constraints, and all-day participation should be encour¬aged, allowing for people to arrive and leave as they desire. And everyone should be encouraged to contribute to the service provided they are known to be true believers of good report. This would alleviate the stranger-to-stranger casual contact most churches generate by their impersonal and clergy-laity at¬mosphere.</p>
<p>But what about the mega-churches? These require more than one service; there must be time constraints to allow for each service to remain on schedule.<br />
Remember, we are addressing the conditions for the Church in the last days. The days of the megachurch are numbered. And, frankly, if a church is too big to do things properly then it’s too big, period. Better that it divide it¬self into more autonomous, local groups that allow for more participation.</p>
<p>Were the gathering held over a pe¬riod of hours, people could come and go as their needs required, or as the Lord allowed under difficult circum¬stances. The meal could be planned for a certain time to allow for convenience, as could some of the teaching and some of the worship, but all else, including additional teaching and worship, should be relatively spontaneous. That additional preaching, teaching, prayer, praise, worship and ministry could be engaged in throughout the day, sometimes in small groups apart from the main if the Spirit leads.  In this way the family of God would be just that—a family in the true sense of the word. Unbelievers who are brought by members would marvel at the love and close fellowship. They would know we are disciples of Jesus by our love for one another. As it is, they are brought to sterile proceedings conducted under formal auspices and polite non-committal greetings.</p>
<p>Formalism and politeness should not be confused with reverence and consideration. If all things are to be done decently and in order (I Corin¬thians 14:40), then reverence toward God and consideration of one another is imperative. But formalism and polite¬ness are reserved for strangers, not for family members.  The application of reverence and consideration still allow for spontane¬ous and full involvement by the whole family of God.</p>
<p>In today’s transient society, this is extremely difficult. Many desire such fellowship, but there are few others of like mind—who insist on purity of doc¬trine and practice—to provide for it. So we do the best we can by keeping our associations primarily among the breth¬ren, on as consistent a basis as we can.  Some may argue in favor of the forms they are used to, and that’s okay. What I offer here is meant to cause thought on how the body of believers may better honor God and allow par¬ticipation by all who feel led by the Spirit to praise Him at any given time, provided all is done in order and does not interrupt what is taking place at the moment. If someone is praying, prophe¬sying, teaching or preaching, they should not be interrupted by someone who feels “moved” to take the lead. This is the consideration aspect of fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>TO PROVIDE CORPORATE WORSHIP<br />
</strong>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. (Colossians 3:16)</p>
<p>We all have need to worship our Creator. While this may be accom¬plished on the individual level, there is something uniquely edifying in corpo¬rate worship. The infectious atmosphere of group praise results in a heightened sense of belonging to the family of God. This has a beneficial effect upon our spiritual walk.</p>
<p>How the corporate body worships is important. Scripture indicates that spontaneous praise in word and song, led by the prompting of the Holy Spirit, should be the norm (Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16). Music to God’s ears is not always the same as music to our ears. We listen to the sounds while He hears the heart sing.  Now, not just any sound is accept¬able for worship and praise. The main¬taining of reverence, even while making a “joyful noise” is important.  If anyone does get out of hand, it is up to the elders to maintain control so that all things are done decently and in order (I Corinthians 14:40).</p>
<p>Whatever form the worship takes, those leading should consider whether it appeals to the soul or to the spirit. We often mistake good feelings for spiritu¬ality when, in fact they may be carnal. This doesn’t mean that when we are truly fed spiritually it doesn’t produce good feelings. But the criterion that should guide us is whether or not the worship causes us to focus on the object of our worship or on the feelings themselves.  This is often a fine line, but we should be on safe ground if we keep all things within the scope of reverence and sobriety, notwithstanding that it may also be joyous as opposed to “happy.”</p>
<p><strong>TO PRAY FOR ONE ANOTHER<br />
</strong>For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. (Colos¬sians 1:9)</p>
<p>Prayer is one aspect of ministry that can be – and indeed must be &#8211; entered into by all members of the Body. Inter¬cession is important to our realization of other’s needs, and to the demonstra¬tion of love for them.  There are no qualifications for prayer other than that we live our lives in such a way that our prayers are not hindered. This is illustrated in Paul’s exhortation to husbands to honor their wives as weaker vessels, yet equal in their relationship to God:<br />
Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered. (1 Peter 3:7)</p>
<p>This instruction, however, does not apply only to the husband-wife rela¬tionship, but to every relationship with man and with God. For this verse is in the context of godly living:<br />
Likewise, ye wives, be in sub¬jection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives; While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.  Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.  For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands: Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.  Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.  Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous: Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.  For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile: Let him eschew evil~ and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.  For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. (I Peter 3:1-12)</p>
<p>A woman who is not in subjection to her husband has no more confidence in answered prayer than a husband who does not love and honor his wife. Nor, for that matter, does anyone who is not being obedient or walking in the love of God toward all men.  The requirement for prayer is that we live righteously before God and men. This righteousness is not a false piety, but a humble attitude that sub¬mits to the commandments of the Lord as stated in Scripture. At the heart of all of the Lord’s commandments is the command to love not only ‘those who love us, but those who hate us.</p>
<p>It is love for God and for man that forms the basis for all righteousness in our thoughts and practices. And, again, while we are justified by faith, and not by the deeds of the law, we cannot willfully (holding a rebellious attitude without repentance) disobey God’s commandments and still be saved. This is why James wrote that faith without works is dead, being alone (James 2:26).  The evidence of our obedience to God’s commandments is our adherence to the command to love one another in the manner prescribed by Scripture:<br />
Let love be without dissimula¬tion. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.  Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another; Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord; Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer; Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.  Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.  Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.  Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.  Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.  If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men. (Romans 12:9-18)</p>
<p>Is it more clear now, what Jesus meant when He said, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect” (Matthew 5:48)?  The word “perfect” (Greek, teleios) signifies having reached maturity.  It is argued that maturity does not equate to sinlessness, but to a general spiritual growth. This is true, as long as we do not lean upon it as an excuse to continue in sin. While we will never be sinless as long as we remain in the flesh, God does expect us to strive for perfection in our spiritual life. Our flesh may continue to wage warfare against us, but we must exercise our own wills to resist the flesh:</p>
<p>There is therefore now no con¬demnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh: That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.  For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.  For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.  Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.  So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.  But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.  And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.  But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.  Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.  For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die. but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.  For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. (Romans 8:1-14)</p>
<p>It was not my intention to digress from the subject of prayer to that of holy living. But as we study God’s Word on the subject of prayer, we see that it cannot be separated from holy living. Many who adhere to other relig¬ions pray to One they do not know.  But the same can be said about many who call themselves Christians. They have not grasped the true, holy character of God; they think of Him as some being who is disposed to meet their demands for comfort in this life. Holiness (which is really another word for separation from sin and from the love of the world) is God’s character; it is also to be the character of His children.</p>
<p>Now, there are times when we are not to pray for others—that is, for relief from their suffering. Why should we pray for a rebellious person? Better that he continue in suffering so that he may recognize his need to surrender to God.  If we are to pray in the Spirit, we must be sensitive to the Spirit’s work in others. If God is chastening a brother for his sins, we must agree with that chastening and instruct that brother to repent; otherwise there is no prayer for his suffering. Yet we do not altogether refrain from praying for him. We should pray that God’s work be done in his life.</p>
<p>This is illustrated by Paul’s seem¬ingly extreme measure of commanding the Corinthian brethren to turn one of their own over to Satan for the destruc¬tion of his flesh so that his spirit might be saved (I Corinthians 5:5).  In all things, not the least in prayer, we are to be led by the Holy Spirit. Let us therefore examine ourselves to see if we are in the Faith, and if there is anything that might be hindering our prayers.</p>
<p><strong>TO BEAR ONE ANOTHER’S BURDENS<br />
</strong>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, re¬store such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.  Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.  For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.  But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.  For every man shall bear his own burden. (Galatians 6:1-5)</p>
<p>Intrinsically linked to prayer is the scriptural admonition to bear one an¬other’s burdens. It does not mean that we should take another’s burden upon ourselves past the point where he can bear the burden himself. Each must be brought to the place where he may be¬gin to bear the burdens of others, and not be a drain upon the resources of those upon whom he must depend for a time. This is individual ministry, not corporate.</p>
<p>The Scripture verses above might at first seem contradictory. The problem lies in the words translated “burdens” (v. 2) and “burden” (v. 5). In verse 2, we are commanded to bear one another’s burdens (Gr. Baros: weight, load, bur¬den; something that presses down upon us). In verse 5, we are told that each man must prove his own work or min¬istry, by bearing his own burden (Gr. phortion: a task or service). The task (phortion) for each of us, is to bear the burdens (baros) of others. It is the law of Christ (love) that is fulfilled when we do this. To not do this is to esteem our¬selves too highly, which is contrary to God’s Word:<br />
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.  Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others. (Philippians 2:3-4)</p>
<p>When Paul speaks of not doing anything through strife, he is saying that we must not be contentious with one another, particularly for the sake of our vanity. Rather, we are to look upon others as better than ourselves. Yet this does not negate the need for contention when it comes to standing for truth or righteousness. If a brother is in sin, or an elder or pastor is acting unjustly, each must be confronted with his sin. This will often lead to contention; but if we are on scriptural grounds, and not just contending for contention’s sake, or to exert our own will, then the sin of contention falls upon those who refuse scriptural correction.  It is humility before the Lord that causes us to contend for the Faith and for righteousness. This is evidenced by the fact that these verses immediately precede Paul’s instructions to have the mind of Christ, which is one of humility:</p>
<p>Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.  But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and be¬came obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. (Philippians 2:5-8)</p>
<p>So we see that our heavenly Father wants us to be obedient, just as Jesus was obedient. For this is the evidence of our humility. Yet outward piety is in it¬self insufficient for conformity to the law of love. All things must be done by faith, relying upon the Holy Spirit to convict us of the need to conform to God’s Word where we might be lack¬ing, and then respond accordingly.</p>
<p>There are many areas in which we must bear one another’s burdens, and often this requires a great deal of sacri¬fice on our part. With the present-day emphasis upon psychological theory that sets boundaries for service lest we be taken advantage of, it is easy to find excuses not to help others. But Scripture doesn’t set boundaries.  How often do we have the means to help a brother in need through no fault of his own, yet we guard it greed¬ily. We allow ourselves to be put under the burden of tithing to our church, but will not give beyond that because we consider it the church’s responsibility to provide for the brethren. This is no dif¬ferent than relying upon the welfare state to take care of those whose care is legitimately charged to us.</p>
<p>In some cases it is advisable to take advantage of the welfare offered through the state. But as much as is in our power as believers in Christ, we should not be party to perpetuating a system that has usurped the role of the family and of the Church in meeting the needs of our relations.  This is expanded in the next section.</p>
<p><strong>TO MINISTER TO THOSE IN NEED<br />
</strong>And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.  As we have therefore opportu¬nity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith. (Gala¬tians 6:9-10)</p>
<p>An important function of the Church is to care for its members. In contrast to bearing one another’s burdens, this is corporate ministry, not individual.  Yet because the modern churches are largely impersonal, the needs of in¬dividuals often go unnoticed. People are reticent to seek help from strangers. And a congregation whose leadership stands somewhat aloof will inspire few genuinely hurting people to seek help whether spiritual or temporal. Often the closest contact people have to their pas¬tor is limited to a handshake at the door. And that is meant for them to compliment him on his eloquence rather than to seek solace for their par¬ticular need. Of course, they can make an appointment with his secretary for a set time for counseling.</p>
<p>Benevolence committees help where they can, but those in charge are also often strangers to the vast majority of congregants—especially in large churches. Fellowships that multiply themselves into more fellowships at the point when they begin to become less personal are more able to minister to the needs of one another. They are also more intimidating to people who do not want to get too intimately known. But this latter problem is not really a prob¬lem for true believers who see the need to sacrifice themselves for others.</p>
<p>When one’s needs are made known to the fellowship, it should be deter¬mined by the eldership how best to meet those needs, whether spiritual, fi¬nancial or of any other nature. In all cases, wisdom is paramount. We may do more harm than good by seeking to alleviate every adverse condition un¬conditionally.  Is a brother attempting to help him¬self without being a burden to others? Or is he taking advantage of the love of the brethren?</p>
<p>For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.  For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.  Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.  But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.  And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.  Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. (II Thessalonians 3:10-15)</p>
<p>All of the questions of need, necessity, and personal responsibility factor into the decision of whether to help and how much to help. In any case, it is up to godly eldership, guided by Scripture and the Holy Spirit, to make the final decisions in these matters.  Generosity coupled with prudence should mark the charity of a church body just as it should that of individu¬als. Limited help to those outside the Body of Christ may also be allowed, provided the same criteria apply.</p>
<p><strong>THE STRUCTURE OF THE UNDERGROUND CHURCH</strong><br />
When considering the structure of the underground church, we must remember that, by its’ very nature, the church will have to operate differently than it does now.  The status quo will not be feasi¬ble for a church that must function un¬derground.  When you cannot simply congregate at a specific building at a specific hour each week, and openly show that you are there by having the parking lot filled with cars, and have a big sign on the front proclaiming what you are, it will mean that we must adapt to a different way of doing things, and a different leadership structure in order to function.</p>
<p>The primary need of the underground church is the development of BIBLICAL modes of leadership.  The modern method of selecting one man as “the pastor”, and requiring him to fulfill all of the duties of pastor, teacher, evangelist, prophet, and apostle completely negates the New Testament method of plurality of leadership, with each individual in the local church developing and using their spiritual gifts to build up the church.  We have created a “spectator sport” church that has a group of people sit in the pews and do nothing, while watching one or two men do their “thing” on the platform and behind the pulpit.  This will not work when the church has to go underground!</p>
<p>Every Christian will have to take an active part in the function of the church in order for it to survive.  To meet the needs of preaching, teaching, evangelizing, organizing new groups as necessary, counseling, sharing resources to meet physical needs, providing for each others safety, and so on will require that everyone use the gifts and abilities that God has given them.  The leadership will HAVE to maintain sound doctrine and discipline, the deacons will HAVE to administer to the needs of people, the evangelists will HAVE to use discernment in their approaching people with the Gospel, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>LEADERSHIP<br />
</strong>And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ: That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edify¬ing of itself in love. (Ephesians 4:11-16)</p>
<p>The adage, “No man is an island unto himself” is best exemplified within the congregation of the saints of God. Not only can man not come to full ma¬turity in his social, business and other human endeavors, the believer in Christ cannot come to maturity in the Faith without submission to proper leader¬ship within the Body of Christ.  Note the word “proper.” Many be¬lievers in Christ have encountered expe¬riences in their churches that have been at or near two extremes:</p>
<p>• Authoritarian, cult-like domina¬tion by spiritual leaders;<br />
• Insufficient discipleship and im¬proper application of God’s Word to fully equip the saints in their quest for attainment of Christlikeness.</p>
<p>Both often result in loss of faith in Christ and an aversion to authority. At best they may result in immaturity and lack of understanding of what God re¬quires of His people. Both work con¬trary to the best interests of the individual and of the Body of Christ as a whole. For those who do not com¬pletely cast off faith in Christ, these ex¬tremes can lead toward a go-it-alone attitude.  There are many who claim that they don’t need “church.” Everything they’ve encountered has discouraged them from trusting in leadership within the Body of Christ.  Without realizing it, what they re¬ally mean is that they don’t need im¬proper leadership. And they are right. But they are wrong if they think they can continue to walk apart from the Body of Christ and still attain to spiri¬tual maturity.</p>
<p>And let us consider one an¬other to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. (Hebrews 10:24-25)</p>
<p>It isn’t enough to study God’s Word on one’s own and keep to oneself, for that would be contrary to the Scriptures one claims to believe. While the Holy Spirit may give insight on the basis of one’s personal study, it is not God’s will that His children grow up unattended and without opportunities to be ministered to, and to minister to others.  This will be particularly important when we, as Christians, are having to live and function in a “hostile enviroment”.</p>
<p>The purpose of leadership is to pro¬vide the means by which God’s people may be fitly joined together, bringing about the unity of the Faith that will strengthen the corporate body as well as the individual.</p>
<p>Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend. (Proverbs 27:17)</p>
<p>Now there are diversities of gjfts, but the same Spirit. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.<br />
And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.  But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.  For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit; To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gift of healing by the same Spirit; To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues: But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.  For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.  For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. For the body is not one member, but many. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body? If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?  But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him. And if they were all one member, where were the body?  But now are they many members, yet but one body.  And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.  Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary: And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.  For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked: That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.  And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.  Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular. (I Corinthians 12:4-27)</p>
<p>Every member of the Body is impor¬tant to the whole. Every member has been gifted by God to contribute to what is lacking in all the other members.  It is up to the leadership to culti¬vate the gifts of the individual mem¬bers. Leadership has largely failed to do this, preferring instead to cultivate the natural talents of worldly-wise people. They have mistaken natural talent for spiritual gifts, often because they have relied upon currently popular psycho¬logically-based “spiritual gifts” surveys.  Because of this failure on the part of leadership, true believers are discour¬aged from continuing under that leader¬ship’s direction. Paul’s lesson in I Corinthians 12 does not end at delineating the impor¬tance of every member of the body.</p>
<p>For he places that importance within the context of submission to proper leader¬ship: And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.  Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?  Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?  But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way. (I Corinthians 12:28-31)</p>
<p>The more excellent way is love as outlined in Chapter 13. Yet even love cannot be fully manifested in an indi¬vidual believer’s life unless that believer is functioning within the Body of Christ.  Certainly he may be able to do good works motivated by love; he may be able to accomplish much in the way of personal growth and understanding of God’s Word. But apart from the cor¬porate Body of Christ he will never at¬tain to the full stature of maturity that God intends. He will always be lacking. </p>
<p><strong>OFFICES</strong><br />
The proper term for this heading should probably be “Ministries,” rather than “Offices.” In considering this, I felt that, for lack of a better term, that of “Offices” delineates between the anointed position for a particular minis¬try as opposed to the functioning of a particular ministry that may be per¬formed by any gifted member of the Body of Christ. For example, the office of pastor is conferred upon one who meets the qualifications of eldership, and whose gifting is for the pastoral care of the Body as a whole. This is con¬trasted with the gifting of caring for other individuals given on occasion to other members of the Body. So the term offices must be understood within this context.</p>
<p>Whether Paul was speaking in Ephesians 4:11 of one office called “pas¬tor-teacher,” or two distinct offices— one called “pastor,” the other “teacher”—is open to debate. Many of today’s pastors prefer to claim the combined title. This makes little difference, simply because all elders must be able to teach, with the exception of deacons. In fact, the office of pastor is not even mentioned in I Corinthians 12, whereas all the other of¬fices are. This could be taken as evi¬dence that the mention of “teacher” suffices for that of pastor as well.</p>
<p><strong>ELDERS/BISHOPS</strong><br />
Due to tradition, there has been a distinction made between the idea of elder as opposed to that of bishop. The office of bishop is not one replete with pomp and circumstance, clerical collars, flowing robes and mitered hats. This is another invention of ecclesiasticism born out of Roman Catholicism.  In some Protestant congregations, particularly within the “high church” denominations such as the Lutheran, Episcopalian, Eastern Orthodox, etc., there are bishops assigned to oversee the parish pastors. The heady nature of “bishopry” in the modern age has even infected some of the charismatic churches. This is really the role of an apostle, who is merely one of the elders.  Peter is one example. He refers to himself as an apostle and fellow elder (sumpresbuteros) in I Peter 5:1:  The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.</p>
<p>Scripture demonstrates that the term elder is synonymous with that of bishop:<br />
For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in or¬der the things that are wanting, and ordain elders [presbuterosl in every city, as I had appointed thee: If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.  For a bishop [episkopos] must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre; But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate; Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to ex¬hort and to convince the gainsayers. (Titus 1:5-9)</p>
<p>So the title of bishop is properly as¬signed to the elders who rule the churches and minister to the congregation’s needs, both spiritual and temporal.  Some believe that this means that the bishops are to be ordained from among the elders, but that they are not necessarily synonymous. But in view of the consistent use of the term bishop to describe the duties of elders by Paul in his letters to both Timothy and Titus, this would not seem to be the case.</p>
<p>The apostles, prophets, evangelists and pastor-teachers are all elders. In view of the centuries-old misuse of the term and office of bishop as one of higher rank, it would be more advantageous to use the term “overseer”’ today. Primar¬ily, we’ll use the term “elder.”  The term “elder” comes from the Greek “presbuteros,” meaning someone who is older in terms of age. It has a secondary meaning which connotes higher rank. In Israel the elders were the learned men of the Sanhedrin, as well as the administrators of the city. All were expected to be of impeccable character and reliable in the administra¬tion of their duties. They rightly de¬served special honor among the people. The fact that the elders of Israel did not attain that position easily or at a young age contributed to the synonymous us¬age of the term elder for both age and wisdom in the Faith.  It is not to be any less the case in the Church.</p>
<p>From where did the practice of ro¬tating elders in terms of office come? Certainly Scripture does not suggest that the office of an elder is subject to re¬election. When does a man cease to be an elder? An elder is an elder for life unless he sins and fails to repent. Even if an elder sins it should be the object of the fellowship to restore him, not to dis¬card him. Even after he can no longer function in his office due to age or dis¬ability he should still be honored as an elder.<br />
Neither the position of “elder” nor that of “deacon,” as they are acquired and maintained in most of the churches today, are scriptural. They are born out of Protestant tradition which is only slightly different from that of Roman Catholicism.</p>
<p>All elders must be able to teach God’s Word. The pastors (or shepherds) are particularly gifted to guide the flock into the truth, but they are by no means the only ones who teach.  This doesn’t mean elders must merely possess a particular skill known as “teaching.” It means they must be able to rightly communicate the Word of God in a congregational setting. The ability to teach is a gift of the Holy Spirit that comes with unique anointing for all elders, whether apostles, prophets, evangelists or pastor-teachers.</p>
<p><strong>Qualifications For Elders/Bishops<br />
</strong>Scripture gives clear guidelines for the qualifications required for anyone who would aspire to be an elder:<br />
This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he de¬sireth a good work.  A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach; Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;<br />
One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?) Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.  Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. (I Timothy 3:1-7)</p>
<p>In either case, these qualifications are necessary for all elders. And given these strict requirements according to God’s Word, it is little wonder that many true believers are concerned about the condi¬tion of their fellowships. Few men in the first-century Church met these qualifica¬tions. How fewer still meet them today after having been so far removed from the authority of the original apostles?</p>
<p>Many pastors cannot control their own children, yet they will not relin¬quish their livelihood for the sake of scriptural purity. Many elders are ap¬pointed or elected according to their natural talents, popularity, or even fi¬nancial standing, rather than according to biblical qualifications. Perhaps in some churches no one would meet these qualifications. Then why are they functioning as churches except that they have a franchise charter from a de¬nominational superstructure?</p>
<p><strong>Duties Of Elders/Bishops<br />
</strong>Scripture also outlines the duties of the elders:<br />
The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed: Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; Neither as being lords over God’s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock. (I Peter 5:1-3)</p>
<p>The elders are commissioned to rule the Church, which means they are to keep the flock in line with God’s Word. They are not to keep it in line with their particular agenda. This is why Peter says they are not to lord it over the flock; they are to be true ser¬vants to the people in their hearts and in their actions. How different this is to the role taken by many pastors today.</p>
<p>When Peter says they should feed the flock he implies that they are all pastors to some degree, although the of¬fice of pastor will be seen to be unique to the other offices.  Obviously, pure motives are essen¬tial to the duties of elders. Constraint does not mean merely functioning un¬der protest; it also means functioning without pure motives.</p>
<p><strong>Apostles.<br />
</strong>The term apostle derives from the Greek, apostolos, lit., “one sent forth” (apo, “from,” stello, “to send”). The word is used of the Lord to describe His relation to God, (Hebrews. 3:1). The original Twelve chosen by the Lord were called Apostles. Paul, though he had encountered the Lord Jesus on the road to Damascus, had not “companied with” the Lord “all the time” of His earthly ministry, and hence was not eli¬gible for a place among them, according to Peter’s description of the necessary qualifications (Acts 1:22). Paul was commissioned directly by the Lord Himself, after His Ascension, to carry the Gospel to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>It is argued that there are no apos¬tles today; the office was done away af¬ter the original eleven and Paul died.  It is true that there are no apostles of the same stature of Paul and the other twelve who had personal encoun¬ters with Jesus. But nowhere in Scrip¬ture are we told that apostles are only those who walked with the Lord. This is a presupposition based upon faulty theology.  We must, of course, make a distinc¬tion between the original Apostles and those who followed after.</p>
<p>The true apostle will not allow those under his care to stray from the purity of God’s Word. His authority is backed up by his ability to persuade the Eldership as a whole and the congrega¬tion as a whole not to follow those who would subvert their faith.  In turn, the apostle is accountable to the body for his own adherence to Scripture. If he fails he is to be judged as a false apostle (Revelation 2:2).</p>
<p>Apostles today do not define the Faith which has been once and for all defined through the Scriptures. Nor are the signs of an apostle that Paul iterated in II Corinthians 12:12 necessarily fol¬lowing today’s apostles for several rea¬sons:</p>
<p>• The original twelve were commis¬sioned to establish the Church; in practical terms, they operated in all the offices—apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers;</p>
<p>• The miracles they performed were part of that unique role, neces¬sary to demonstrate to the people the transition of authority from the priests of Israel to the elders of the Church;</p>
<p>• There has been a great lack of faith in the Church since the apostasy began in the third century;</p>
<p>• The churches are still largely apostate and lacking in proper leadership.</p>
<p>Nor do today’s apostles offer new revelations upon which the Faith is to be based and the believers to be held ac¬countable. But they are the true elder¬ship of the local church—those looked up to by the rest of the eldership as hav¬ing attained a status of honor due to their long service to the Lord and their faithfulness to His Word.  They plant congregations and over¬see them until they come to maturity. They may or may not then move on to plant other churches. Another word for apostle today is missionary, although not all missionaries are apostles, but many are evangelists.</p>
<p>We should not be afraid of the word apostle merely because of the abuses committed by false apostles. The office is really not as imposing as some make it out to be. When the apostle’s service is rendered in a spirit of humility and sub¬mission to the rest of the elders he is not to be feared, but honored.  As far as the number of apostles a fellowship should have, Scripture gives no indication. Let the Lord have His way and all things will be done de¬cently and in order.</p>
<p><strong>Prophets<br />
</strong>When the term “prophet” is men¬tioned there immediately springs to most minds the image of a bearded, sack-cloth-clad person who proclaims doom and gloom upon those unheedful of his proclamations. The Old Testa¬ment prophet who could call down fire from heaven or pronounce death or worse upon his adversaries is no longer among us. Today’s prophet is one who calls the local body into accountability to God’s Word. He does not prophesy new revelations that require the breth¬ren’s obedience.  The prophet has the gift of discern¬ment to a large measure. He discerns er¬ror in teaching and practice and warns of the consequences if those espousing that error remain unrepentant.  Does God give revelation to His prophets, or are they to concern them¬selves only with discerning and speak¬ing relative to Scripture? There is nothing in God’s Word that would hinder a true prophet from receiving a word from the Lord warning of im¬pending crisis, or coming blessing for that matter. There are reports out of the underground Church in other countries where prophetic words warned of dan¬ger to the saving of many.<br />
The reason we don’t experience such things in the West is that we largely don’t believe in them. We don’t need them; we’re rich and increased in goods. Who needs God’s prophets when the Church is so “holy”?</p>
<p>The true prophet is not a popular fig¬ure except among those who love God’s Word without equivocation. That is, those who esteem Scripture as the only source of spiritual truth. Those who love true prophets hate human wisdom. Those called to task by the prophet for adding other “truths” to their teachings more often than not resist the prophet’s appeals for repentance.  Today the prophet is not stoned for his audacity to hold church leadership accountable. Rather, he is politely ne¬glected and/or spoken of in ridiculing terms. Most churches do not recognize their prophets as prophets, but as trouble makers who stir up the waters.  Women may function as prophet¬esses, because God’s Spirit has been poured out upon all flesh (Acts 2:17). However, the office of prophet as one of the elders is reserved for men (I Timothy 2:12).</p>
<p>A truly biblical church holds its prophets in high regard while at the same time not neglecting to test the prophets by their own pronounce¬ments.  In a sense, the apostle is the prophet to the eldership, and the prophet is to hold the apostle, the elder¬ship and the congregation accountable to God’s Word. At the same time, the prophet himself is subject to the apos¬tles, the other elders and the congrega¬tion. All are to be subject to one another, which is the meaning of Ephe¬sians 5:21.</p>
<p>Yet while we are all to be submitted to one another, there is special honor and recognition which must be given those gifted with the offices of apostle and prophet.  This is also true for those women who are truly prophetesses. While they are not allowed to teach in the assem¬bly, there are ample Scriptures to allow for their prophetic voices to be heard, and their words tested by Scripture.</p>
<p><strong>Evangelists<br />
</strong>The word evangelist derives from the Greek evangelistes (lit., “a messen¬ger of good”). Other than Ephesians 4:11, which names evangelists among the officers of the churches, it is found only two times in Scripture. The first reference merely names Philip as an evangelist (Acts 21:8); the second is found in Paul’s exhortation to Timothy to beware of false teachers and to do the work of an evangelist (II Timothy 4:5).</p>
<p>With such limited reference to the office, it is left to the name itself to de¬fine the function of the evangelist, which traditionally has been assigned to those who preach the Gospel to unbelievers.  An evangelist is not merely one who holds huge crusades in public are¬nas. Most evangelism is to individuals and small groups. Such is far more ef¬fective and its results far more lasting than those of open air arenas.  This is not to dismiss the impor¬tance of mass meetings. The Holy Spirit has used men of God who have brought the Gospel to millions through this means. By the preaching of Peter more than 3,000 souls were added to the Church in one day (Acts 2:41).</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, every believer—man or woman—is supposed to evangelize. But although someone may be gifted with the ability to pro¬claim the Gospel publicly, the office of the evangelist is reserved for men who meet the qualifications of eldership.  Therefore, the evangelists must be part of the governing body of the fel¬lowship in order to bring their unique gift to bear for the edifying of the body and for the building up of the saints.</p>
<p>The evangelists function in the name of the fellowship and bring order and substance to the preaching of the Gospel to non-believers brought into the midst of the congregation.  Some evangelists are emboldened to witness on the streets. This does not mean that their testimony is limited to merely proclaiming Christ crucified and resurrected. In keeping with the Lord’s admonition to count the cost be¬fore choosing to follow Him, evangel¬ism must of necessity include a delineation of what God expects of those who claim to trust in Him.  The evangelist must take personal responsibility for those to whom he has witnessed. Sometimes that may not be possible, in which case he must com¬mend those souls to God and trust Him to complete His work in them. But at the least, he should insist that converts under his ministry submit themselves to the eldership of a legitimate church body and unite themselves in fellow¬ship with the saints.  The practice of merely preaching the Word and then moving on, or of referring people to any church that will take them, has proven largely fu¬tile. Many new converts are left to flounder and/or to wind up in apostate churches.</p>
<p>The evangelist does not go out on his own volition, but is sent out by the local body with its blessing and cover¬ing. When sent out for the purpose of  evangelizing, he should be supported by the fellowship so that nothing he re¬quires is lacking. Wages lost through time taken from work should be made up by the fellowship so that his family lacks nothing.  The work of the evangelist is vital to the continuing life and growth of the fellowship. Those who do the work of an evangelist should be highly honored by the brethren.</p>
<p><strong>Teachers<br />
</strong>It is often stated that the reference to pastors and teachers in Ephesians 14:11 implies that this is really one off¬ice combining the duties of pastor and teacher. This is only partly true, for Scripture tells us that all bishops must be able to teach. Since pastors are bish¬ops, they must also be able to teach; but so, too, must the apostles, the prophets and the evangelists, since they also com¬prise the eldership of the church body. To some degree all of the gifts will overlap among the elders as well as among the congregation.</p>
<p>That considered, it seems that Paul was not combining the offices of pastor-teacher, so to speak, but was delineat¬ing a specific office—that of a teacher.  There are men who are qualified for eldership in every respect, but they are not gifted as apostles, prophets, evangelists or pastors. These teachers minister the word as a gift in itself. They have the ability to rightly divide the Scriptures, and to relate the truth to the people in a way that touches their spirits, not just their ears.  However, all elders must be allowed to teach, for that is one of the qualifica¬tions for their office.  There are also women teachers, ac¬cording to Titus 2:3-5:<br />
The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh ho¬liness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p>This is the only scriptural passage that speaks of women as teachers. The rule of the Church is that the bishops are to teach the men” God’s Word; the men, in turn, are to teach their wives and children. However, it is the exam¬ple and the teaching by the elder women that solidifies the young women’s position in relation to their husbands.</p>
<p>It is not really expedient for a man to teach his wife how and why she is to be in submission to him. It is far better if the elder women practiced this rule as an example and taught it to the younger women.  Beyond this, teaching in the Body of Christ is reserved for the bishops, and these are men only. </p>
<p><strong>Pastors<br />
</strong>I purposely reversed the order of pastors and teachers as outlined in Ephesians 14:11. My reason for doing so is because the office of the modern-day pastor encompasses that of the teacher and often that of all the other offices. So I felt it would be more logical to deal with it last.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, mainly due to the influence of Roman Catholicism, the office of pastor has taken on a connota¬tion that was never intended: a primary ruler of a synagogue, or teaching center, to whom all others are in subjection. This is also the model for the rabbinical office in Judaism, which may have played a role in the early Judaizers in¬fluence in the churches. Even in churches where eldership is more than a rubber stamp for the pastor’s vi¬sion—where pastors are in submission to an “elder board”—the reality is that the pastor fulfills virtually all the offices that Ephesians 4:11 enumerates.</p>
<p>The New Testament word trans¬lated pastor from the Greek is poimen (“a shepherd, one who tends herds or flocks”).  Only in Ephesians 4:11 is it ren¬dered as “pastor.” All other New Testa¬ment references (17 in all) are rendered “shepherd” or “shepherds,” and refer to Christ as the Shepherd of our souls, or to actual shepherds of sheep, or are metaphors in Christ’s teachings for keepers of God’s flock.  Interestingly, the Ephesians 4:11 reference to pastors is the only one in Scripture that applies to an office in the Church. For having become the only of¬fice of any real authority in most churches, this is surprising. There is less emphasis upon pastors than upon the other offices which are mentioned sev¬eral times.  Yet while the office of pastor is never elaborated upon, the meaning is clear. A pastor, or shepherd, is one who tends the flock of God. He doesn’t merely feed the flock as any hireling can do. Rather his primary responsibil¬ity is to guard them against spiritual danger and to lead them into pastures of truth. The pastor’s heart is to be one of gentleness and kindness, yet bold in admonishing those straying to remain in the Faith.</p>
<p>The pastor binds the wounds of the flock and carries those he must to safety. If one strays, his heart goes out to the lost sheep and he will search for them until he has found them and brought them back into the fold. He vis¬its the sick and those suffering in other ways. One who does not do these things is not a pastor, no matter what his office is traditionally called. </p>
<p>More than one pastor is needed in most fellowships, for the work required is often tiring and burdensome.  As with all the other offices, that of the pastor finds similarity in the gifting of others in the congregation. Elder women may pastor the younger women; other men may pastor one an¬other; even young people may pastor other young people to some degree. But the office of the pastor, like all the other offices, is reserved for men who possess the qualifications for eldership.</p>
<p>So sacred is the office of the pastor that God has severe warnings for those who would abuse it (Jeremiah 2:8; 10:21; 12:10; 22:22; 23:1-2; Ezekiel 34:1-10).  It is especially sobering to realize that this sacred trust is representative of the Lord Himself. Throughout the Old and New Testaments He is represented as the good and faithful Shepherd who loves and cares for His flock.  The pastor’s ministry is really to individuals more so than to the group. Some deacons may actually assume the role of pastors to some degree.</p>
<p><strong>Deacons<br />
</strong>There is another class of leaders who oversee the temporal needs of the congregation. These are called deacons (from the Greek, diakonos, which de¬notes an attendant, or waiter at tables or in other menial duties). This word is variously translated “servant,” “minis¬ter,” and, in the case of an office within the Church, “deacon.”  Women are also referred to in their role as servant, but not in relation to the office of a deacon, who must be the hus¬band of one wife (it does not say, “or the wife of one husband”).</p>
<p>In his salutation to the Philippian Church, Paul alludes to a distinction be¬tween the bishops and deacons:<br />
Paul and Timotheus, the ser¬vants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and dea¬cons. (Philippians 1:1)</p>
<p>This does not mean a deacon is any less an elder than any of the other offi¬cers in the Church. The bishops are the teaching and pastoring elders. The dea¬cons are elders who serve the temporal needs of the flock.  The requirements for elders are strict, but no more strict than those for deacons, save for the ability to teach.</p>
<p>We see that deacons must meet all the qualifications that the elders must meet. In a sense, the deacons are really non-teaching elders. For they, too, do the work of the ministry and edify the Body of Christ, working for the perfec¬tion of the saints (Ephesians 4:12).  The only real difference between the elders and the deacons is that the elders must be able to teach God’s Word in a congregational setting. Also, the deacons are not spoken of as rulers over the flock in the way elders are. Yet due to their qualifications they should be af¬forded the same honor as the elders.</p>
<p>All who hold positions of authority in the local congregation comprise the eldership, whether bishops (teaching elders) or deacons (non-teaching elders). Yet even deacons will have great bold¬ness in the faith to preach the Gospel if they use their office well.</p>
<p><strong>RULES OF FELLOWSHIP<br />
</strong>When we speak of rules of fellowship, we are not speaking of ritual or how to construct a worship service. We are speaking of rules that guide individual believers in relationship to one another, particularly when they come together for worship, prayer and service. As well, we should be aware of what the Lord requires in all our dealings with one another.  There are certain rules set forth in Scripture which suggest more than just optional acquiescence. These rules are not to be sidestepped if the fellowship is to fulfill the purposes to which it has been called by God.</p>
<p><strong>Be humble of spirit<br />
</strong>One rule of fellowship is that we not think of ourselves as better than oth¬ers. Man is naturally inclined toward comparing himself with others, either judging himself as greater or lesser based on righteousness, talents, intel¬lectuality, or on any number of factors. What escapes him, unless confronted by God’s Word, is that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God; no one is righteous compared to God, or worthy of merit before God:<br />
As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one: There is none that under stand¬eth, there is none that seeketh after God.  They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofit¬able,’ there is none that doeth good, no, not one. (Romans 3: 10-12)</p>
<p><strong>For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. (Romans 3:23)</strong></p>
<p>Jesus is our example of humility; yet we see by His life that humility does not mean a false piety and milquetoast demeanor. It means honest appraisal of self before God. When we can look at ourselves in the light of Christ, then we will look into the perfect law of love and see how far short we lie; we will be humbled to the point of despair, and will claim, as did the Apostle Paul, that we are the chief of sinners. Only when we come to that place will we be suit¬able for service to God and to man. Only then will we be able to live by the law of love which requires that we surren¬der our personal desires in order to meet the desires of others, provided we not violate Scripture in the process. The mind of Christ must be our own mind as well:<br />
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men: And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. (Philippians 2:5-8)</p>
<p>The mind of Christ is one of humil¬ity; it is not one of self-exaltation. Al¬though the Word of God existed with God, as God from eternity past, He humbled Himself to the point of suffer¬ing at the hands of His own creation for the sake of the Father’s love. It is not possible for love to be expressed with¬out humility. Humility places others before oneself.  In God’s economy, humility and love are virtually synonymous. This means that we should look after the welfare of others even above our own welfare:<br />
Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowli¬ness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.  Look not every man on hw own things, but every man also on the things of others. (Philippians 2:3-4)</p>
<p>“Charity” in the Greek is agape— translated “love” throughout Scripture.<br />
The law of love is contrary to human nature. Man is basically selfish in his heart; he fights for his own desires above the desires of others. And it does¬n’t matter how much he protests his love for others, his natural instinct is to look out for number one. Occasionally a person will make sacrifices for the sake of those he does love, but God’s law of love requires that we make those same sacrifices for all others, even our enemies. That law cannot be obeyed until we have first put on humility.</p>
<p>This is especially important in the underground church.  When we are totally dependent upon each other as brothers and sisters in Christ, we must put others ahead of ourselves or else the local group of believers will tear itself apart, with disastrous consequences.  If we allow pride or selfishness to have place among us, we will put all of us at risk of being turned over to the authorities, loss or theft of vital supplies, and so on.  This cannot be allowed in the Body.</p>
<p>If we will walk in the Spirit we will not fulfill the lusts of the flesh to do those things that place our needs and wants above the needs and wants of others. And we will forgive those who trespass against us; we will not seek retribution or vengeance, but will seek their greater good. A true believer in the Lord Jesus Christ has the same desire that God has, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance (II Peter 3:9).  Especially in the Church must we not take retribution against one who we believe has offended us. God’s Word is clear that if we have anything against a brother we should go to him and ask that he make things right, not for our sakes, but for his:<br />
Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</p>
<p>But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.  And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.  Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven.  For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.  Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven. (Matthew 18:15-22)</p>
<p><strong>Be the servant of all<br />
</strong>Godly humility is a prerequisite for all service in the Body of Christ. The meaning of the word “ministry” is serv¬ice. In the Church it is most often used to denote the service of the eldership toward the body. That is, the elders and deacons, though rulers over the spiri¬tual and temporal affairs of the churches, are to look upon their work as service or ministry to the people.</p>
<p>Sometimes that service means strong confrontation against sin. It is¬n’t for the minister’s sake that this con¬frontation must take place, it is for the sake of the one being ministered to.  Although there are the “official” ministers—the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastor-teachers, deacons —the burden of service to at least some degree lies upon every member of the Body of Christ.  Service performed out of duty rather than out of love will eventually result in frustra¬tion and, sometimes, despair. We must be able to discern when God is telling us to cease, and we are beginning to act in the flesh rather than in the Spirit.</p>
<p>The general rule is that, if we see a brother in need, we are not to wait to be asked for help; we should offer our help immediately. And we are to give generously as the Lord leads us. How¬ever, we are not to act in the flesh in our giving any more than in any other service to the brethren.  If a brother is lazy and will not provide for himself or for his family, we do him no good service to support his indigence. This is how God’s Word sums it up:<br />
For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.  For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.  Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.  But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.  And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.  Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother. (II Thessalonians 3:10-15)</p>
<p><strong>Be kind to all<br />
</strong>It should go without saying that love also commands that we be kind to all. Our carelessness in how we treat others often goes undetected. A curt word here, a failure to consider ano¬ther’s feelings there. These can add up to the point where we may alienate brethren in Christ who are prone to be easily offended.</p>
<p>There are certain specifics related to kindness as found in God’s Word:<br />
Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one an¬other, even as God for Christ’s sake hath forgiven you. (Ephesians<br />
4:31-32)</p>
<p>Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering; Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.  And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. (Colossians 3:12-14)</p>
<p>Kindness is not an option; it is an imperative aspect of fellowship within the Body of Christ. Kindness takes all sorts of forms. It is manifested in works of charity; it is revealed in small acts of consideration and politeness.</p>
<p><strong>Judging Righteously<br />
</strong>A problem that is systemic in the churches is that of judging un¬righteously. We all have some precon¬ceived ideas of what constitutes right and wrong, not all of which are neces¬sarily grounded in Scripture. Because our conscience is offended by some¬thing, we assume that everyone’s con¬science should be offended by that same thing as well.</p>
<p>I am not speaking of sin as deline¬ated in Scripture, but of practices that may be deemed “questionable” by a religious establishment, by negative experiences or by plain human “reasoning”.  The early Church was already in¬fected by legalists who imposed restric¬tions on food and drink as well as on other practices.  They believed that everyone should do as they did.  However, there is room for variety and individuality in the Body of Christ.   Paul addresses these in Romans 14:</p>
<p>Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.  For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.  Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.  Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.  One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.  He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.  For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.  For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.  For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.  But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.  For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.  So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.  Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way.  I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.  But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.  Let not then your good be evil spoken of.  For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteous¬ness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.  For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.  Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.  For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.  It is- good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.  Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemeth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.  And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin. (Romans 14:1-23)</p>
<p>It is significant that these words were penned especially to the church in Rome. In later times that church be¬came apostate and began to impose dire condemnation upon people for eat¬ing certain things at certain times, for not observing special days in special ways, for not abstaining from meat, even forbidding its “priests” to marry. Judgment came through the hierarchy of that church and filtered down through its religious-minded adher¬ents. And that same judgment contin¬ues to this day.  Many Protestant churches have in¬corporated their own lists of taboos which are not supported by Scripture when rightly divided. Some, on the other hand, have thrown off even bibli¬cal restrictions in the name of freedom in Christ. Both approaches are wrong.  Just as God gave everything freely to Adam and Eve, yet forbade them to eat from one specific tree, so Christ has given us liberty in all things except those which His Word specifically for¬bids. Even so, we are commanded not to cause our brother to stumble on ac¬count of the biblical liberty that we possess.</p>
<p>However, all of the above does not mean that we are not to judge AT ALL.  We are SUPPOSED to judge what people who claim to be Christians say in relation to God’s Word.  One of the great sins of the modern churches is the refusal to judge the teachings of others. It is considered not only unloving to do so, but impolite. Our “civilized” Western culture frowns on confrontation; it makes people un¬comfortable to hear others vociferously contend for their beliefs. Whether those beliefs are right or wrong isn’t the is¬sue; the issue is peace at any price.</p>
<p>As a result of this cultural proclivity toward politeness, Christians sit in their pews listening to doctrines of de¬mons and watching demonic practices take place without challenge. A pastor can spout the worst heresy and no one will call him to account publicly be¬cause that would be impolite. And ush¬ers stand ready to physically remove anyone who would dare do so.</p>
<p>It may be well that government is ready to protect religions against un¬due harassment from those who are not of the particular religion in question; but it has no business entering into the disputes among those who are of like faith, particularly if one disrupting the service is a member of the congrega¬tion. Religious leaders who would take advantage of such laws are demon¬strating a lack of confidence in what they teach. If they cannot defend their teachings and practices to their congre¬gants, but must use force to evict one who questions them on a reasonable and scriptural basis, they are unsuited for a defense of the Faith. As well, they are sinning by taking a brother before the secular courts to protect their relig¬ious “rights.”</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean, however, that just because a teacher misstates some¬thing we have the freedom to call him down in front of the congregation. It would be best to first confront him in private, try to reason with him from Scripture on the areas that need correc¬tion, and then ask him to make a public retraction of his error.  When we fail to judge false teach¬ings we are not being loving; we are being cowardly. We are leaving the sheep to be devoured by the adversary. All believers in Christ assume the role of a watchman. We all have the Holy Spirit who gives us the ability to dis¬cern truth from error. If we fail to warn the brethren of the error in their midst we are guilty of that same error, even if we disagree with it.</p>
<p>With all this, we must keep in mind the many Scriptures that warn against judging. All things must be in balance, based upon the Word of God and min¬istered by the Spirit of God. When we attempt to judge others by our own judgment we are guilty of hypocrisy.</p>
<p><strong>The strong are to bear the weak<br />
</strong>Immediately following his instruc¬tions on not judging according to what one eats or drinks, Paul instructs us that those who are strong in the faith must bear with the weaknesses of oth¬ers who have not attained to the same spiritual maturity:</p>
<p>We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.  Let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edifi¬cation.  For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.  For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.  Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be like minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus: That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.  Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. (Romans 15:1-7)</p>
<p>In essence, Paul is saying that we must please others and not ourselves when it comes to the unimportant as¬pects of living. Even though we have freedom in Christ we should restrict ourselves in what we eat and drink so that we not offend our brother or cause him to stumble. Too often Christians assert their “right” to do as they please, without regard to the feelings of those who may (rightly or wrongly) perceive those actions as sinful, or at least un¬desirable. So while taking advantage of their liberty they are breaking the law of love which supersedes all other con¬siderations. Not opening themselves up for judgment on what they eat or drink, they open themselves up for judgment on lack of love.</p>
<p>At the same time we refuse the judgment of others, we willingly judge them for what we perceive as sin. In either case, even when judging sin as defined by Scripture, we must first judge ourselves. This is what Jesus meant when He commanded us to “Judge not according to the appear¬ance, but judge righteous judgment” (John 7:24).  There is a righteous judgment which cannot be challenged because it is predicated upon God’s truth as re¬vealed in His Word. It is not predicated upon man’s religious ideas and per¬sonal likes and dislikes. Yet even when exercising such righteous judgment we must be careful that we are not being hypocritical:</p>
<p>Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.  And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of Chine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly. (Matthew 7:1-5)</p>
<p>In view of the many Scriptures that tell us to judge, it is obvious that the Lord is not telling us to refrain entirely from judging others. He is warning us that the same standard by which we judge others will be used against us when we are judged by God. It is a common practice that those who want license to do as they please will quote verse 1 and ignore the preponderance of Scripture that requires us to judge sin in our midst. When taken in context we see that the Lord was warning us not to judge a brother who sins if we are in sin ourselves.</p>
<p>Obviously we will always be sinful as long as we are in this flesh, but a man’s heart attitude toward his own sin must be one of revulsion and a desire to root it out of his life. As well, he must have confessed his sin to the Lord before confronting another brother for his sin. This is what Jesus meant when he said that we must first remove the beam out of our own eye before we can even confront a brother on the mote in his.</p>
<p>Our Father is immensely patient and merciful toward us; He requires that we be the same toward our breth¬ren. Every avenue of escape must be presented to a brother in sin. The first avenue is confrontation. If we are not spiritually prepared to confront a brother in sin we are failing in our calling by the Lord; worse, we are fail¬ing our brother who needs our correc¬tion. It is a sad thing to see sin go unjudged in the Body of Christ because those in leadership are either spiritu¬ally deficient, or are too cowardly to address that sin. They would rather ignore sin for the sake of peace, thus bringing the leaven to full loaf.  In all cases of judgment we must focus on the real sin, not on the heart of the sinner.</p>
<p><strong>Ministry to children<br />
</strong>Much is said about fellowship among the brethren, that is, adults. But there is the aspect of adult-child relationships within the Body of Christ that needs to be addressed.  As a rule, today’s churches provide separate ministry for children and young people. As soon as the family walks into the church building it frag¬ments into peer group ministries. Ide¬ally, children should be with their parents through at least part of the ministry, hearing the Word of God and worshiping together.  There is room for children’s minis¬try provided it does not become an end in itself, but rather remains a supple¬ment to the overall ministry of the fel¬lowship.</p>
<p>Scripture does not deal with this issue because it didn’t exist in the early Church. But because it isn’t in Scrip¬ture doesn’t mean it is totally invalid. If there is going to be any specific min¬istry to children it seems that biblical guidelines do exist.  Many, if not most, Sunday school teachers for children are women. They teach both boys and girls. This may be alright up to the point where a boy reaches puberty. At that stage he is to be considered a man and his teachers should be men. We are not talking about emotional maturity, but physical maturity. Admittedly, this is my own reasoning from what I know of Scrip¬ture and Jewish tradition that would have prevailed for the early Church.  It is perfectly alright for women to teach young girls and other women, provided they focus on the areas that Scripture delineates:<br />
The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed. (Titus 2:3-5)</p>
<p>So let the men teach the men as soon as they reach puberty; let the women teach the girls and young women to follow God’s instructions for them, not to follow the contrary ways of the world.  Generally, all adults should treat children with love and kindness, and all children should treat adults with respect and honor.</p>
<p>Considering these rules of fellow¬ship we are led back to the Ten Com¬mandments. If we would obey those commandments we would find that they are based upon love for God and for our fellow man—especially our brethren in Christ.  This is the foundation for all of our interaction with one another; love.</p>
<p><strong>THE UNDERGROUND CHURCH IN A HOSTILE ENVIROMENT<br />
</strong>“Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents and harmless as doves.  But beware of men, for they will deliver you up to councils and scourge you in their synagogues.  You will be brought before governors and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.  But when they deliver you up, do not worry about how or what you should speak. For it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak; for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.  “Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.  And you will be hated by all for My name’s sake. But he who endures to the end will be saved. (Matthew 10:16-22)</p>
<p>Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?”   And Jesus answered and said to them: “Take heed that no one deceives you.  For many will come in My name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will deceive many.  And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled; for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.  For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places.  All these are the beginning of sorrows.  “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you, and you will be hated by all nations for My name’s sake. And then many will be offended, will betray one another, and will hate one another.  Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many.  And because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold.  But he who endures to the end shall be saved. (Matthew 24:3-13)</p>
<p>It is evident from Scripture that the enviroment of the world that the church will exist in during the “last days” will be a hostile one.  Dangerous times, persecution, betrayal by those we thought were our friends, imprisonment, and so on will be the norm.  We must be prepared to face those times with wisdom, spiritual maturity, and physical and emotional preparation.  In this section, we will discuss some of the “practical” aspects of life “underground” as a persecuted and “illegal” group.  These items are in no particular order, and should always be guided by the basic truth that no one can be prepared for every eventuality.  Also, our ultimate guide is God, not any booklet that a man has written.  Pray about these things and let God guide you as to what YOUR level of preparation should be, and how YOU should handle various situations.</p>
<p>Christians in Rome used to use the “fish” symbol as a means of identifying one another without openly declaring their Christianity.  One person would casually draw a curved line on the ground with their staff, or their foot.  Then, the other person (if a Christian) would draw the opposite curve, forming the “fish” or “icthus” symbol, which was a symbol for the name of Christ.  In this way, believers could identify each other on the “Q.T.”.  In the near future, we may have to once again use the methods of persecuted churches around the world to live, meet, minister, gather supplies, and evangelize here in the United States.</p>
<p>When your read that “Christians” or “Christian Fundamentalists” are singled out for some national ill, take heed. That is usually the first step in stirring up hatred against a particular group.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:<br />
</strong>• If you are one of “those people”, this is the time to decide whether to stay put or move. Remember, most of this continent was settled by people who switched countries rather than staying and fighting. You may have to continue the tradition.<br />
• Have a bug-out kit.<br />
• Avoid any travel through areas controlled by those who are against you. At best you only get raped or beaten up, at worst you end up dead.<br />
• If you belong to a visible, easily identified group, you may want some members who are not easily recognizable to do the shopping and other essential functions. During World War II, blond-haired, blue-eyed Jews saved a lot of their people.<br />
• Establish an information network to be in position to evaluate what is likely to happen.<br />
• If you have extra supplies, you can sell or barter for necessities.<br />
The “commandments” of security are:<br />
• Do not discuss personal or family business with anyone not directly involved.<br />
• Do not trust a politician or bureaucrat’s word or promise.<br />
• Never give your real name or address when purchasing survival supplies.<br />
• Never let strangers into your home.<br />
• Do not turn your back on an unlocked door or window.<br />
• Do not have your street address on any of your IDs or mail. Use a P.O. box as much as you can.</p>
<p>Remember that accumulating supplies is easy only before day that you become a “target”. After that, it is a chancy and more expensive proposition. Many people will be after the same materials once the situation becomes sticky. So stock up early (as much as possible). And keep quiet about what you buy. Cache some of your supplies using lengths of plastic sewer and water pipes. The ends can be easily sealed with end caps available from the same source as the pipes. Governments have a nasty habit of confiscating supplies from people who prepared for disasters to give to the indigent. Their logic runs to the philosophy that by giving supplies away, you reduce the possibility of the indigents turning into predators. All they are doing is putting everyone at risk.</p>
<p>It is important to have a designated place for your group to meet should you have to evacuate. You must have a place picked out well before the excrement hits the fan. It should be easy to identify and to reach by all members of your group. And it should not be on the official evacuation route.</p>
<p>A few words about surviving without doctors. Most physicians, hospitals, and medical supplies are located in cities. Most disaster scenarios will hit cities harder than the countryside. Therefore, you may have to do without conventional medical treatment after a disaster. The human body has remarkable capabilities of healing itself, especially if the injured and their companions practice intelligent benign neglect.</p>
<p>While on the subject of medical matters, do not forget about veterinary antibiotics. People who for decades have used antibiotics to combat their infections have not produced normal quantities of antibodies and have subnormal resistance to many infections. People who have not been dependent on antibiotics have these antibodies. In the aftermath of a disaster, most survivors would be in rural areas. Many would need antibiotics. Much of their need could be met by supplies of veterinary antibiotics kept on livestock and chicken farms, at feed mills, and in small towns.  Many animals are given more antibiotics in their short lives than most Americans receive in theirs. In many farming areas, veterinary antibiotics and other medicines are in larger supply than are those for people. Realistic preparations to survive should include using these supplies.</p>
<p>We are living at the edge, and given the current state of affairs, we should be on guard. Once a scenario unfolds, it can progress at a frightening pace. Be prepared at all times.</p>
<p><strong>What to do:<br />
</strong>• Take stock of what you are eating, and take stock of what you have on hand. That will tell you how long you could survive if you cannot access the stores  tomorrow.<br />
• What would you do for water if you cannot “participate” in the economy? Find what other sources you have, and have those sources tested.<br />
• What happens to your sewage? How would you cope if your system is disrupted?<br />
• Are you on medications? How long could you last without them? Do you have an alternate source for them? Always refill your prescriptions ahead of time. If questioned, just say that you are taking a trip. Have at least a month’s supply on hand.<br />
• Is your vehicle ready to roll in case of an emergency? How much gas do you have? What about lubricants, brake fluid, spare parts?<br />
• Do you have a place to go? Do you know the topography of the area between your home and your place of retreat?<br />
• Do you have the knowledge to deal with emergencies? Do you have the skills to put the knowledge into practice?<br />
• Have you taken a first-aid course in the last five years? Do you have the supplies and instruments to give first aid?<br />
• Are you aware of what is happening in your community, your country, and in the world? Do you have radios, communication devices, and newsletters to keep you informed? When gathering for meetings, never assume that you can use the same place twice, and vary the times often.  Develop ways of informing the group without “broadcasting” it to all and sundry.  Be prepared to share supplies with your brothers and sisters in need.  And lastly, remember that God is in control of all things at all times; have faith!</p>
<p><strong>CONCLUSION:<br />
</strong>No matter what the days ahead hold, God has given us tremendous promises in His Word to sustain us.  We are called not to fear, but to boldness.  When we consider how God fed the Israelites in the desert during the Exodus; how He made them victorious in battle by HIS power (and not their own); how He enabled the first century Christians to change the world with the Gospel in spite of persecution and martyrdom; and how He has sustained generations of Christians throughout the history of the Church; we should be encouraged to know that he can (and will) do the same for us.</p>
<p>We live in dangerous times, but also exciting times!  It is very probable that our generation will see the fulfillment of the “battle between good and evil”.  We will have an opportunity to minister God’s Word to the world at the focal point of world history.  And in spite of the possibility that we as individuals may have to suffer hardship, or possible even martyrdom, remember that the culmination of these things will be the revealing of our Lord, Jesus Christ, in His glory, and that we will be like Him, and be with Him, forever.  AMEN!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hebrews 5:11 &#8211; 6:3<br />
“Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing. For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. For every one that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.<span id="more-1194"></span> </p>
<p>But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.   (CHAPTER 6)  Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,  Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment. And this will we do, if God permit.&#8221; The King James Version,  1769.</p>
<p>In the Book of Hebrews, Paul lists several teachings that he refers to as the &#8220;milk&#8221; of the Word.  These teachings are basic, and are suitable for &#8220;babes&#8221; in Christ.  However, in many of today&#8217;s churches, these &#8220;milk&#8221; doctrines are not taught in depth.  This results in a shaky foundation upon which to build our knowledge and understanding of Scripture.  As we go through this condensed study, we will examine these &#8220;milk&#8221; doctrines in detail.</p>
<p><strong>MILK BOTTLE #1:  REPENTANCE FROM DEAD WORKS</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;REPENTANCE</strong> — a turning away from sin, disobedience, or rebellion and a turning back to God (Matt. 9:13; Luke 5:32).  True repentance is a “godly sorrow” for sin, an act of turning around and going in the opposite direction. This type of repentance leads to a fundamental change in a person’s relationship to God.   In the Old Testament the classic case of repentance is that of King David, after Nathan the prophet accused him of killing Uriah the Hittite and committing adultery with Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba. David’s prayer of repentance for this sin is found in Psalm 51.   In the New Testament the keynote of John the Baptist’s preaching was, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matt. 3:2). To the multitudes he declared, “Bear fruits worthy of repentance” (Matt. 3:8; Luke 3:8). When Jesus began His ministry, He took up John’s preaching of the message of repentance, expanding the message to include the good news of salvation: “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel” (Matt. 4:17; Mark 1:15).   In Jesus’ preaching of the kingdom of God is seen the truth that repentance and faith are two sides of the same coin: by repentance, one turns away from sin; by faith, one turns toward God in accepting the Lord Jesus Christ. Such a twofold turning, or conversion, is necessary for entrance into the kingdom (Matt. 18:3). “Unless you repent,” said Jesus, “you will all likewise perish” (Luke 13:3, 5). This is the negative, or judgmental, side of Jesus’ message. The positive, or merciful, side is seen in these words: “There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents” (Luke 15:10).&#8221;   &#8220;Nelson’s new illustrated Bible dictionary&#8221;</p>
<p>As fallen human beings, born with a &#8220;sin nature&#8221; as a result of Adam and Eve&#8217;s fall, we begin life moving in a certain spiritual direction.  Unfortunately, that direction is AWAY from God.  Although we were created to be in fellowship with God, our back is turned on Him, and we are chasing the attractions of this world, &#8220;the lusts of the flesh&#8221;.  In order to begin a relationship with God, we must CHANGE DIRECTION.  Becoming a Christian is not just an emotional &#8220;sorrow&#8221; that occurs while the choir sings &#8220;There Is Room At The Cross For You&#8221;, but is forgotten in the rush of the work week as we deal with &#8220;the real world&#8221;.   We have to TURN AWAY from our sinful behaviors and attitudes, and TURN TOWARD GOD.</p>
<p>See:<br />
Ezekiel 14:6   Ezekiel 18:30-32<br />
Luke 13:2-5   Matthew 9:13<br />
Luke 24:46-47  2nd Corinthians 7:9-11<br />
2nd Peter 3:9</p>
<p>What happens if this &#8220;milk&#8221; doctrine is not taught thoroughly?  If a proper knowledge of repentance is not taught, you mislead people into thinking that they can be saved without turning away from their sin.  You wind up with people whose &#8220;salvation experience&#8221; is nothing more than a temporary emotional moment.  They believe that because they cried a little, and said a rote prayer, that they are &#8220;born again&#8221;.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  BIBLICAL salvation ALWAYS comes with a change of direction, not just the emotion of the moment.  Many &#8220;professing&#8221; Christians have never had a REAL Born Again experience, and it shows in their lives.  When the divorce rate, teen pregnancy rate, use of Internet pornography, and so on are the same INSIDE the church as they are OUTSIDE the church, are the so-called Christians really Christian?</p>
<p><strong>QUOTES ON THIS SUBJECT:<br />
</strong>&#8220;Among evangelical churches probably no more than one out of ten know anything experientially about the new birth&#8221;  (emphasis added)  Dr. A.W. Tozer</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyone with any spiritual maturity and discernment, who knows the religious climate in America today, knows most church members are not saved.&#8221;  Dale Burden, editor of a Baptist publication called &#8220;The Gist&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be surprised to meet 25% of my members in heaven.&#8221;  Dr. W.A. Criswell</p>
<p>&#8220;85% of our church members have never been born again&#8221;   Billy Graham (1940&#8242;s)</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could get half the church members saved, we would see a great revival.  In fact, I think if we could get half the preachers in America converted, we would see a mighty revival&#8221;   Dr. Monroe Parker</p>
<p><strong>MILK BOTTLE #2:  FAITH TOWARD GOD</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;FAITH</strong> &#8211; a belief in or confident attitude toward God, involving commitment to His will for one’s life.  In the New Testament, &#8220;faith&#8221; covers various levels of personal commitment. Mere intellectual agreement to a truth is illustrated in James 2:19, where even demons are said to believe that there is one God. Obviously, however, they are not saved by this type of belief. Genuine saving faith is a personal attachment to Christ, best thought of as a combination of two ideas-reliance on Christ and commitment to Him. Saving faith involves personally depending on the finished work of Christ’s sacrifice as the only basis for forgiveness of sin and entrance into heaven. But saving faith is also a personal commitment of one’s life to following Christ in obedience to His commands: &#8220;I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that He is able to keep what I have committed to Him until that Day&#8221; (2 Tim. 1:12).  Faith is part of the Christian life from beginning to end. As the instrument by which the gift of salvation is received (Eph. 2:8-9), faith is thus distinct from the basis of salvation, which is grace, and from the outworking of salvation, which is good works.&#8221;   Nelson’s new illustrated Bible dictionary<br />
The second &#8220;milk bottle doctrine&#8221; goes along with the first, that is, repentance FROM dead works must be coupled with faith TOWARD God in order to be effective to salvation.  Turning away from your sinful ways and following Buddha may result in a life that is better in terms of behavior, but will not bring you one step closer to being saved.  When you turn away from going in the wrong direction, you must go in the right direction, not just another equally wrong direction.  Nor is it enought to simply stop doing &#8220;bad&#8221; things.  You must move toward God in faith, trusting in His gift of life in Jesus Christ.  Intellectual agreement is not enough.  Faith toward God is giving Him control of your life, and following Him instead of trying to get Him to conform to your agenda.  God is LORD, not a &#8220;genie&#8221; you rub to get goodies.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 4:10-12<br />
</strong>&#8220;Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole. This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.&#8221;   The King James Version,  1769.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 16:27-34<br />
</strong> &#8221;And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here. Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas, And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house. And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.&#8221;   The King James Version,  1769.</p>
<p> <strong>1st Peter 1:18-21<br />
</strong>&#8220;Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot: Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you, Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.&#8221;<br />
The King James Version,  1769.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 5:27-32<br />
</strong>&#8220;And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them, Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us. Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.&#8221;   The King James Version,  1769.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 16:25-27<br />
</strong>&#8220;Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began, But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith: To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.&#8221;   The King James Version,  1769.</p>
<p><strong>MILK BOTTLE #3:  The Doctrine of Baptisms</strong></p>
<p>Paul&#8217;s use of the word baptisms (Greek  baptismoi) is a definite reference to more than one baptism, since it is a clearly plural word.  There are several baptisms to which he could be referring:</p>
<p> A) The baptism of John the Baptist<br />
 B) The baptism of the Holy Spirit<br />
 C) The baptism in water in obedience to Christ&#8217;s command.<br />
 <br />
Before we examine these, let&#8217;s look at what the word baptism itself means baptizo { bap-tid’-zo}(Strong&#8217;s number 907) <br />
1) to dip repeatedly, to immerse, to submerge (of vessels sunk)<br />
2) to cleanse by dipping or submerging, to wash, to make clean with water, to wash one’s self, bathe<br />
3) to overwhelm</p>
<p>&#8220;The clearest example that shows the meaning of baptizo is a text from the Greek poet and physician Nicander, who lived about 200 B.C. It is a recipe for making pickles and is helpful because it uses both words.  Nicander says that in order to make a pickle, the vegetable should first be ‘dipped’ (bapto) into boiling water and then ‘baptised’ (baptizo) in the vinegar solution. Both verbs concern the immersing of vegetables in a solution. But the first is temporary. The second, the act of baptising the vegetable, produces a permanent change.   When used in the New Testament, this word more often refers to our union and identification with Christ than to our water baptism. e.g. Mark 16:16. ‘He that believes and is baptised shall be saved’. Christ is saying that mere intellectual assent is not enough.  There must be a union with him, a real change, like the vegetable to the pickle!&#8221;<br />
Bible Study Magazine, James Montgomery Boice, May 1989.</p>
<p>baptisma { bap’-tis-mah} (Strong&#8217;s Number 908) <br />
1) immersion, submersion<br />
1a) of calamities and afflictions with which one is quite overwhelmed<br />
1b) of John’s baptism, that purification rite by which men on confessing their sins were bound to spiritual reformation, obtained the pardon of their past sins and became qualified for the benefits of the Messiah’s kingdom soon to be set up. This was valid Christian baptism, as this was the only baptism the apostles received and it is not recorded anywhere that they were ever re-baptized after Pentecost.<br />
1c) of Christian baptism; a rite of immersion in water as commanded by Christ, by which one after confessing his sins and professing his faith in Christ, having been born again by the Holy Spirit unto a new life, identifies publicly with the fellowship of Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Thus the plural &#8220;baptisms&#8221; referred to by Paul as &#8220;doctrine&#8221; or teaching would refer to those baptisms that are appropriate for a Christian; that is:<br />
 1) The baptism of the Holy Spirit which is received at salvation (Matthew 3:11, John 3:5-8)</p>
<p> 2) The baptism in water in obedience to Christ&#8217;s command (Matthew 28:18-20)</p>
<p>It is also possible that he is including the baptism of John (Acts 18:24-28) since there were people who had been baptized this way who had not yet been baptized into Christ.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the baptism of the Holy Spirit must come first, as it is the only one of the two that changes the heart and is the &#8220;true&#8221; baptism (Ephesians 4:4-6).  It is also important to remember that the word &#8220;baptize&#8221; includes the meaning of a fundamental change in the nature of the item baptized (in cloth, from one color to another; in vegetables, from fresh to pickled). </p>
<p>What does this mean if it is not taught correctly?<br />
Water baptism is seen as having salvation, rather then being mere formalism if the Holy Spirit has not already baptized a person.  This leads to people falsely believing that they are saved, and presenting a false witness to the world as hypocrites.  Also, the Holy Spirit is seen as something that comes to a believer later, and only for the &#8220;truly righteous&#8221;, as a select group; thus denying the cleansing and power of every true Believer.</p>
<p><strong>MILK BOTTLE #4:  The Laying On Of Hands</strong></p>
<p>Paul lists the &#8220;laying on of hands&#8221; as a basic &#8220;milk&#8221; doctrine because it is fundamental in several areas: </p>
<p>First, as an understanding of SUBSTITUTIONARY ATONEMENT.  This is where the sins of one are transferred to another, as in the case of the High Priest laying his hands on the sacrifice for the Day of Atonement, transferring the sins of the people of Israel to the sacrificial animal.  In the New Testament, our sins have been transferred to Jesus Christ, as our atonement.  See Leviticus 4:13-15,  Leviticus 16:20-22,  2nd Corinthians 5:21.</p>
<p>Second, as an understanding of giving of authority, or ordination.  Authority in the New Testament is given by the &#8220;laying on of hands&#8221; for specific work, commission to ministry, and so on.  See Acts 6:1-6,  Acts 13:2-3,  1st Timothy 5:22,  2nd Timothy 1:6.</p>
<p>Third, as a means of transfer of the Holy Spirit by the Apostles, which is important because it verifies the apostolic ministry of Paul.  See Acts 8:14-23,  Acts 19:1-7.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;SUDDENLY&#8221;.</strong> “Lay hands suddenly on no man” (1 Timothy 5:22) seems to warn against attacking or arresting another person without warning. But the laying on of hands here referred to was the gesture of ordination (see 1 Timothy 4:14; 2 Timothy 1:6), and “suddenly” is used in the obsolete sense of hastily. RSV translates: “Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands.”</p>
<p><strong>MILK BOTTLE #5:  Resurrection of the Dead</strong></p>
<p>Resurrection is a &#8220;milk bottle&#8221; doctrine for Christianity because it is the basis of our entire relationship with God through Jesus Christ; and is our hope for the future.  As Paul puts it in 1st Corinthians 15:12-23:       <br />
&#8220;12Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead? 13But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen: 14And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain. 15Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not. 16For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised: 17And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. 18Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished. 19If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.  20But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept. 21For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. 22For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. 23But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.&#8221;       The King James Version,  1769.</p>
<p>What exactly is meant by resurrection?  Is what happened to Lazarus considered a resurrection?  Let&#8217;s see if we can answer those questions:</p>
<p>Resurrection has three primary meanings in the Bible.<br />
1. Miraculous healings. In this usage, resurrection refers to individuals who have been brought back to life (resuscitated) in this present world. Such raisings were performed by Elijah on the Zarephath widow’s son (1 Kin. 17:20–24), by Elisha on the Shunammite woman’s son (2 Kin. 4:32–37) and the dead man who touched Elisha’s bones (2 Kin. 13:21), by Jesus on Jairus’ daughter (Mark 5:41–43) and Lazarus (John 11:43–44), by Peter on Dorcas (Acts 9:40–41), and by Paul on Eutychus (Acts 20:9–12). In these raisings there is no suggestion that the person will not again experience death.</p>
<p>2. Our Lord’s resurrection. This resurrection is clearly linked with the overcoming of the powers of evil and death.</p>
<p>3. The hope of a general resurrection. In the Old Testament Sheol is the place of the rephaim (shades), the Hebrew term for a weakened existence (Is. 14:9–11).  Therefore, the psalmist expected that God would ransom his soul from Sheol (Ps. 49:15). It was Israel’s firm belief in the goodness of God that led the Jewish people to believe that the righteous dead would yet see God (Job 19:26). This expectation was the foundation upon which the Jewish ideas concerning the resurrection were built.</p>
<p>By the time of Jesus, two positions were firmly entrenched within Judaism. The Sadducees, who were oriented to this world, rejected any belief in the resurrection. They believed that such an idea was irrelevant to this life and was not part of the revelation in the Law that God gave to Moses. When they encountered Jesus, the Sadducees sought to trap Him by their question concerning the seven brothers who married one woman. Jesus criticized their view of resurrection life by indicating that earthly marriage patterns are not repeated in heaven. He also condemned their understanding of Moses and the Scriptures (Mark 12:18–27).     The Pharisees, in contrast, believed in resurrection.</p>
<p>The Jewish historian Josephus reported that the Pharisees held that the good dead are transferred into other bodies. Although this report is not totally clear, it is certain that the Pharisees proclaimed a life after death that required a resurrection. It was from the ranks of these scholarly Pharisees that the apostle Paul came (Phil. 3:5). Luke records that in his defense before the Sanhedrin (Jewish Council), Paul stressed that he was a Pharisee of Pharisaic descent and that he was on trial for affirming the resurrection (Acts 23:6).</p>
<p>The New Testament consistently teaches hope in the resurrection of the believer based upon the resurrection of Christ as the “firstborn from the dead” (1 Cor. 15:12–58; Col. 1:18; 1 Thess. 4:14–18; 1 Pet. 1:3–5). This idea of resurrection is expressed in terms of such images as a transformed body (Phil. 3:21), a new dwelling (2 Cor. 5:2), and new clothing (2 Cor. 5:4; Rev. 6:11). The New Testament also contrasts resurrection to life with resurrection to judgment (John 5:29; Acts 24:15).</p>
<p>What happens if this doctrine is not taught correctly in the church?<br />
There is no basis for the Gospel, since Jesus hasn&#8217;t conquered death and the grave.  There is no reason to control behavior if there is no resurrection to judgment.  The &#8220;strength of sin&#8221; is not weakened, since fear of death is still in force.  And finally,  there is no reason for the Christian to hope for anything other than this physical life; therefore, the Christian virtues that set our lives at odds with the world are useless, and are of no benefit.  Christianity becomes merely a &#8220;nice philosophy&#8221; that has no bearing upon the &#8220;real world&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>MILK BOTTLE #6:  Eternal Judgment</strong></p>
<p>Our final &#8220;milk bottle&#8221; doctrine is the one that brings our earthly existence to a finish.  Once we have finished life &#8220;in the flesh&#8221;, we are judged.  The basis for judgment is whether or not we have repented of our sins, and have believed upon Jesus Christ for our personal salvation.  Those who ARE &#8220;written in the Lamb&#8217;s Book of Life&#8221; will enter the Eternal Kingdom at the end of the 1,000 year Millenial Kingdom.  Those who ARE NOT written there will go to the Lake of Fire, &#8220;which is the second death&#8221;.  Although many people feel that it is not right that God should judge us, His holiness and justice will not allow for anything else.  Also, even though He will and must judge us, He has done EVERYTHING He can (even to the giving of His Own Son to pay for our sin) to keep from having to send ANYONE to the Lake of Fire.</p>
<p><strong>SEE:<br />
</strong>John 3:16-19                   2nd Peter 3:9 <br />
Matthew 12:34-37        John 5:22-30<br />
Romans 2:1-16               Romans 14:10-13<br />
Hebrews 9:27                 2nd Peter 2:9<br />
1st John 4:17-18           Revelation 20:11-15</p>
<p>What happens if this is not taught correctly?<br />
If there is no judgment, then sin is not punished, righteousness is not rewarded, the Bible is full of lies, and there is no perfect future eternity, and Jesus death was totally useless. </p>
<p>As we can see, what Paul taught as “the milk of the word” is not being taught correctly in most churches today!  If we can’t even get the “milk” right, what makes us think we will get the “meat” right?  We need to make sure that we are growing in the Lord by having a CORRECT understanding of what HE wants us to know about these foundational subjects.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are told in Scripture that Christ is the Bridegroom and that the Church is the Bride (Ephesians 5:22-32), and that the first event to be celebrated when the Church arrives in “heaven” is the Marriage-Supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:7-9).  However, most commentators and expositors fail to draw the obvious conclusion; that the Biblical “Jewish” Wedding Ceremony has very significant meaning to our understanding of the relationship between Christ and the Church, and that the ceremony (with its’ sequence of events) is a DIRECT parallel to the sequence of events in the life of the believer (including FUTURE events). <span id="more-1191"></span> </p>
<p>Drawing primarily from Scripture, and filling in some of the details with Jewish historical writings that date from the time of Christ (such as the Mishnah), we can see that the story of chosen love, preparation, and fulfillment of the wedding ceremony is the story of Christ’s love for the Church.  We will take each element of the this process, IN SEQUENCE, and show the Biblical connection with the Church.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The selection of the Bride for the Groom by His Father:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>In Genesis 24:1-4, we see that Abraham established the criteria for his son’s “wife-to-be”.  Isaac would not select his own bride, but the Father (or his representative) would do the selecting for him.    See John 6:44, John 17:24,  Romans 8:29-30,  Ephesians 1:3-6, and 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 11:1-2 (speaking of the apostle Paul).</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Free-Will acceptance of the offer of marriage by the Bride:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>Although Jewish culture was patriarchal (male dominated), women had the right of refusal when it came to marriage.  No force could be used to persuade her to marry the prospective groom.  We see this in Genesis 24:5-8 and 24:57-58.  According to the Mishnah, once a woman had refused the offer of marriage, she could not expect ANY benefit from the Groom, such as being able to keep part of the “bride-price”, or usage of any lands owned by the groom.  In Christian terms, when we have rejected Christ, we should net expect God to give us ANY of the benefits of the eternal kingdom, including eternal life.  Speaking of the “bride-price”, the price for a chaste virgin (as established in the Mishnah) was 200 dinars (100 shekels), which was enough to purchase 3 slaves for up to 50 years (until the Year of Jubilee) with some left over.  This was a VERY valuable price, and demonstrates the value of finding a suitable bride.     See John 3:16,  John 12:48,  Acts 2:40-41,  Romans 10:16,  Proverbs 31:10,  1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 6:20, 1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 7:23, and 1<sup>st</sup> Peter 1:17-19.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The establishment of the KETUBAH (the marriage contract):</strong></span></em></p>
<p>EVERY Jewish marriage was preceded by a contract that bound the 2 people together.  See Matthew 26:28.  It is interesting to note that the woman was under the control of her father until she was officially betrothed, at which point she came under the authority of the Groom.  See John 8:44.  The contract included the following items:</p>
<p>A)     The Groom is to provide for the bride’s needs during the engagement period, as well as after.  See 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 1:21-22 and Ephesians 1:13-14.  The HOLY SPIRIT is given to us to “meet our needs” until we fully come into the marriage.</p>
<p>B)     The Bride attests to her purity.  In cases of “true love”, a “fallen woman” (one who had been with another man) could be brought into marriage IF the Groom’s father agreed to “waive” the requirement of virginity for his son.  We see this in the Old Testament story of Rachab, a prostitute who married into the Tribes of Israel to become an ancestress of Jesus (Joshua 2:1 and Matthew 1:5); and we also see it in the entire Book of Hosea, in which a prophet is commanded to marry a prostitute in order to demonstrate God’s love for fallen Israel.  As Christians, we are in the same position of not being able to present ourselves to Christ as being pure when we first met Him, but He overlooks that deficiency, and cleanses us Himself (1<sup>st</sup> Corinthians 6:9-11).</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The MIKVAH (baptism) for spiritual cleansing:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>After the terms of the KETUBAH are agreed to, the couple would separately take a ritual immersion (MIKVAH) as a symbol of spiritual cleansing.  This MIKVAH is where we get the concept of BAPTISM.    See Matthew 3:13-17,  Matthew 28:19,  Acts 22:16,  Ephesians 5:25-27.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The EYRUSIN ceremony:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>After the MIKVAH, the couple would have a public ceremony to express their betrothal (or engagement).  The word “eyrusin” means betrothal, but a secondary name for this ceremony is  Kiddushin, meaning “sanctification”.  This second term expresses what the EYRUSIN period (of at least one year) was all about; that is, setting oneself aside for the other person for the covenant of marriage.  During the ceremony, some items of value were exchanged, and a cup of wine was shared to seal the vows.     See Matthew 26:27-29,  Luke 22:19-20,  1<sup>st</sup> Thessalonians 4:3-4, and 2<sup>nd</sup> Thessalonians 2:13.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The time spent apart until the final wedding ceremony:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>During the indefinite time between the EYRUSIN and the actual wedding ceremony, the bride and groom were considered married, but were not allowed to live together.  The relationship was official, and could only be broken by 1 of 2 things; by the groom divorcing the bride (the bride could not divorce the groom), or by the death of the groom.   During this time, the couple were expected to accomplish the following…..</p>
<p>A)   The groom was to be preparing the home for the bride.  See John 14:1-3.</p>
<p>B)   The bride was to be learning how to be a good wife by learning the skills necessary to keep the home for her husband.  See 2<sup>nd</sup> Timothy 2:15.</p>
<p>C)  The groom would provide a “helper” or friend to care for the bride in his stead during this period of time.  See John 14:15-18.</p>
<p>The Father of the Groom must give His approval for the Groom to retrieve His Bride:</p>
<p>The work that the groom was doing in preparation of his bride’s new home was supervised by the groom’s father.  It had to be the very best that the groom could do, as anything less was considered to be a shame on his fathers name and family.  The groom could not go to get his bride until the father inspected the new home, and gave his approval.  This is why the EYRUSIN period was of an indeterminate length (but at least a year)  See Matthew 24:36.  What is the place that OUR Groom is preparing for US?  See Revelation 21:9-22:2 to find out.</p>
<p><strong>The Procession to retrieve the Bride:</strong></p>
<p>Once the father has given his approval of the groom’s preparations, he would give his permission for the groom to go get his bride.  This would be done in a processional of the groom and his friends and servants to the home of the bride, where she was supposed to be waiting for him, and be prepared to go with him.  There were 4 main factors to this event, as follows:</p>
<p>A)   It would occur at an unknown time, usually at evening.  See Matthew 24:36-44, Matthew 25:1-13.</p>
<p>B)   It was accompanied by the blowing of the shofar (ram’s horn trumpet).  See 1<sup>st</sup> Thessalonians 4:16.</p>
<p>C)  The bride was carried to the wedding, she would never be allowed to walk.  See 1<sup>st</sup> Thessalonians 4:17.</p>
<p>D)  The bride was supposed to be prepared and expecting the coming of the groom, even though she didn’t know exactly when he would come for her.  See James 5:7-8,  2<sup>nd</sup> Peter 3:1-9.</p>
<p><strong>The Wedding Feast:</strong></p>
<p>Once the Bride had been retrieved, the procession would return to the new home that had been prepared by the Groom.  At that point, a feast (as extravagant as the groom and his father can afford) would begin.  The feast is a time of joy, food, music, dancing, and celebration.  See Revelation 19:7-9.</p>
<p>The Bride and Groom begin their life together, forever:</p>
<p>Although the time of waiting between the KETUBAH and EYRUSIN ceremonies until the Marriage Supper probably seem like an eternity for the anxious Bride and Groom, they can now look forward to a full life together in married bliss.  See Revelation 22:3-5 and 22:16-17.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EVEN SO, COME, LORD JESUS!</span></em></strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest misconceptions that many people have about the Bible is that the Old and New Testaments are separate items, dealing with different things.  What needs to be seen is that they both focus on Jesus Christ, just from slightly different viewpoints.<span id="more-1188"></span> </p>
<p>One way to understand this is to imagine how you would adequately document a sculpture if you could only use a regular 35mm camera.  Since you couldn’t take one picture of all of the sides at one time, you would have to take a series of shots, from a variety of different angles, to produce a clear understanding of the statue as a whole.  This series of photos would have to be examined as a group in order to get a grasp of the detail of all aspects of the statue, from all directions. </p>
<p>This is the same way that we have to look at Scripture.  Jesus Christ is so awesome, in so many ways, that no one written story can encompass the whole.  So God gave us a series of written stories, told from a variety of viewpoints, so that we could gain a clearer picture of Jesus.  These stories range from Genesis (Jesus as creator and covenant-maker), through the rest of the Law (Jesus as Righteousness), the historical writings (Jesus as One who guides His People, and Who controls the World), the Prophets (Jesus as Judge and Savior, the ultimate victor), into the New Testament Gospels (Jesus as Savior, the Lamb of God who takes a way the sin of the world), the Epistle’s (Jesus working in the lives of the saved), and finally to the Revelation (Jesus as King of Kings, who returns the earth (and the saved) to their originally intended perfection).</p>
<p>The purpose of this booklet is to help you see Jesus in the Old Testament, so that you can have a greater understanding of the focus and unity of the Bible.  It is my hope that this will lead you to a greater appreciation for the constant interaction that God has had with us through His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Let’s start at the Beginning, in Genesis 1:1,  where one of the names of Christ is seen in the Hebrew Text, but is never seen in any of the English translations.  Christ  As  Creator  in  Genesis  1:1   The ALEPH / TAV</p>
<p>Genesis 1:1<br />

<p>How does this apply to Jesus Christ?  To find out, we must look into the New Testament.<br />
John Chapter 1<br />
1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was in the beginning with God. 3All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. 4In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. 5And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</p>
<p>14And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth. 15John bore witness of Him and cried out, saying, “This was He of whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me.’ ” 16And of His fullness we have all received, and grace for grace. 17For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 18No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</p>
<p>Although we do understand that Jesus is the “Living Word”, meaning that He is the embodiment of ALL of God’s Word; the Greek Text for the phrase “the Word” is SINGULAR, indicating that John is referring to ONE SINGLE WORD.  What one single word from the story of Creation meets the following requirements:  one word, directly connected to God Himself, and was involved in every aspect of creation?  The only answer that meets these requirements is the ALEPH/TAV.</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 1:8-11<br />
</strong>8“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End,” says the Lord, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”<br />
9I, John, both your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. 10I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s Day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet, 11saying, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,” and, “What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches which are in Asia: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.”</p>
<p>As we look at the Book of Revelation, we see Christ using the title “Alpha and Omega”.  These are the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and they make sense as “the first and last” when you consider that the New Testament was written in Greek.  However, John and Jesus (when He was in the flesh) were HEBREW.  Doesn’t it make sense that if two Hebrew men were speaking to each other, that they would use HEBREW?  Also, since the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet are ALEPH and TAV, and since God directly placed these two letters in Genesis 1 REPEATEDLY, doesn’t it seem that Christ is actually applying the Title of ALEPH/TAV to Himself in Revelation?  Jesus is not only the First and Last in that He encompasses all of God’s fullness, but He is also seen directly as the aspect of the Trinity who did all of the “creating” in Genesis chapter 1.  When we take Jesus’ use of this name in Revelation, combine it with John’s explanation regarding “the Word” in John 1, and combine that with the Hebrew Text in Genesis 1, we see that Jesus is truly God, Creator, and Savior.<br />
Now, let’s move from seeing Christ as Creator, to seeing Him in Creation.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 19:1-6</strong><br />
&#8220;The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.  Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,  Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 147:1-5<br />
</strong>&#8220;Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely. The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel. He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.  He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names. Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Hebrew word for what we now call the Zodiac is Mazzeroth (meaning &#8220;12 signs”).  When we look to the pre-Babylonian definitions given to the &#8220;pictures&#8221; of the Mazzeroth, we see that God had indeed written His Gospel in the stars as a sign for mankind.  It was only  in the time of the Tower of Babel, and of the following Babylonian astronomy that the pictures were re-defined to have pagan meanings.  The original meanings assigned to the 12 major signs (each with 3 minor signs accompanying them) were as follows:</p>

Thus we can see that God placed the stars in the heavens as a continual re-telling of the Gospel of His Son, and His victory over sin and death.<br />
Now let’s look at the declaration of Jesus’ ministry that is found in the genealogy  listed in Genesis 5.</p>

<p>“Man (is) appointed mortal sorrow; (but) the Blessed God shall come down teaching (that) His death shall bring (the) despairing rest.”</p>
<p>Now let’s look at Jesus’ interactions with mankind in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>We see a mysterious character who is frequently named as “The Angel Of The Lord” who speaks and acts in ways that are not consistent with other angels.  He receives worship, speaks as God in the first-person, executes judgement, and so on.  The more you study the Scriptures, the more it becomes evident that this “Angel” is God Himself.  But how can people interact with God, and live?  The answer is simple; these are pre-incarnate appearances of Jesus!</p>
<p>See the chart below to see how this “Angel” interacted with a number of people in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The Angel (or “Messenger”) of the Lord in the O.T. is a mysterious messenger of God. The Lord used this heavenly emissary to appear to human beings who otherwise would not be able to see Him and live (Ex.33:20). The Angel of the Lord performed actions associated with God, such as revelation, deliverance, and God’s judgment. The Angel of the Lord appeared to the following O.T. personalities and performed the following actions on God’s behalf.</p>

<p>Now let’s look at how Jesus is seen in the “feasts of the Lord” given in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>With all of the Bible studying that we do, there is one very plain teaching of God that is ignored by most, taught by few, and yet may have the most significant impact on your understanding of the Good News of Messiah, of God’s plan, and of salvation, and of about any subject you can ever learn in Church.</p>
<p>That teaching is God’s plan for mankind that is revealed right in the Scriptures, just waiting for us to find and understand! I am speaking of how God has outlined this plan and given it to the very people who He chose to bring the Scriptures to us today. That teaching which God passed down to us through the Jewish people is His prophetic calendar.</p>
<p>Most people think of a calendar only as the way in which we conveniently mark the passing of the days, synchronizing it periodically so that it coordinates with the seasons. Obviously people need a calendar, and so God created one that would not only help people keep track of the seasons, would not only be a way of remembering when to celebrate events in the eternal relationship between God and His children, but  would also be a way to pass down and foreshadow this plan for mankind.</p>
<p>There are about 40 different calendars in use today, including the modern version of the Gregorian calendar that is used in most of the secular world. But there is one calendar that is different — because the Creator of the Universe created it! The only calendar that God ever created! It is known as the &#8220;Hebrew calendar.&#8221; The Hebrew calendar is a &#8220;lunisolar&#8221; one &#8211; that is, one in which the months are reckoned according to the revolution of the moon around the earth, but which periodically is corrected to coincide with the seasons, which are dependent upon the earth’s revolution around the sun. In principle the beginning of each month is determined by a New Moon (molad) that is based on something called &#8220;an adopted mean value of the lunation cycle.&#8221; To ensure that Biblical festivals occur in appropriate seasons, months are corrected according to a 19-year cycle in which there are 235 new moons.</p>
<p>Years in the Hebrew calendar are counted, naturally, from the Creation of the earth. That makes sense, since it is the calendar that God Himself created for the use of the people of earth. The only problem with this is that there are differing opinions on when Creation occurred.  But the year doesn&#8217;t matter to our current discussion. Each year in the Hebrew calendar consists of twelve or thirteen months, with months consisting of 29 or 30 days. The thirteenth month is introduced 7 times in the 19-year cycle to correct it to the earth’s seasons.<br />
That should be enough to show you that the Hebrew calendar is different than the Gregorian calendar, and to explain why God’s feasts and festivals occur on apparently different dates each year — that is, according to the Biblical calendar they are on the same date each year, while on our secular calendar they are different. </p>
<p>There are 2 different words used in Leviticus to describe the feasts.  They are:<br />
Mo’ed – which means “an appointment, a fixed time or season, an <br />
               Assembly”. Used in Leviticus 23:2</p>
<p>Chag – meaning festival, derived from the Hebrew word chagag, which  <br />
             means to “move in a circle, to march in a sacred procession, to<br />
              celebrate and dance”.  Used in Leviticus 23:6</p>
<p>Thus we see that God’s feasts are appointments with mankind that God has set, and that we should keep (or at least study) because has set these times for a purpose.  Also, they are to be times of joy, as God’s message to man is revealed to us: His grace, power, love, redemption, and provision are all shown in the feasts, and give us cause to rejoice.</p>
<p>Another word that is used in Leviticus, starting in 23:2 is translated into English as “convocation”, but in Hebrew is “miqra”, which literally means “rehearsal”.  Thus we also see that the feasts, as we celebrate them, are rehearsals for future events relating to our redemption.</p>
<p><strong>How Christ Is Seen In The Feasts (Summary)<br />
</strong>Passover speaks of the substitutionary death of the Lamb of God. Christ died on the day of Passover. Unleavened Bread speaks of the holy walk of the believer (1 Cor. 5:6–8). Firstfruits speaks of Christ’s resurrection as the firstfruit of the resurrection of all believers (1 Cor. 15:20–23). Christ rose on the day of the Firstfruits. Pentecost speaks of the descent of the Holy Spirit after Christ’s ascension. Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and Tabernacles speak of events associated with the second advent of Christ. This may be why these three are separated by a long gap from the first four in Israel’s annual cycle.</p>
<p><strong>THE NEW YEAR<br />
</strong>In studying God’s prophetic calendar, it would make sense to start at the beginning. But there are at least two &#8220;beginnings.&#8221; The first was given by God during the Exodus from Egypt, and is written about in Sh&#8217;mot [Exodus] 12:1-3<br />
God said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, &#8220;This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.&#8221;   This Scripture is speaking of the month of Nisan (at that time called &#8220;Aviv&#8221;), in which we find Pesach (Passover). God gave this month as the beginning of the year for the Israelites because they had been &#8220;redeemed&#8221; or &#8220;saved&#8221; or &#8220;reborn&#8221; as a people, brought out from slavery in Egypt. This time of the year was to mark a celebration of Pesach for all eternity. It is the New Year for the Nation of Israel.  Notice that there are 2 “New Years” (Civil (Rosh Hashanah) and Religious (Passover), just as there are 2 “beginnings” for people.  You are “BORN”, and have earthly (CIVIL) life, but you must also be “BORN AGAIN” through the Lamb of God (PASSOVER) to have SPIRITUAL life also.</p>
<p><strong>ROSH HASHANAH &#8211; THE NEW YEAR ALSO?<br />
</strong>Most of us have also heard of Rosh Hashanah, (&#8220;Yom Teruah&#8221; in the Bible) which is commonly known as the &#8220;Jewish New Year.&#8221;  Rosh HaShanah literally means the &#8220;head of the year.&#8221; But it is not the beginning of the &#8220;new year&#8221; according to God. Since the exodus, that has been the month in which God told us to celebrate Pesach. It is believed that this date, the 1st day of Tishri, designates the creation of the world. Therefore it is not only the anniversary of the beginning of the world and the beginning of our relationship with God, but it represents the beginning of the bringing about of His Plan  — His plan for bringing to completion the perfecting of His relationship with us. For this reason the modern &#8220;Jewish&#8221; calendar starts with 1 Tishri, as does God’s &#8220;prophetic&#8221; calendar.</p>
<p>It is interesting and useful to look at the rabbinic interpretations of these feasts and festivals, and it is a curious fact that Rosh Hashanah is conspicuously lacking in the same sort of imagery and symbolism that the other holy days are. We are told that Rosh Hashanah is the &#8220;Day of the Blowing of the Shofar&#8221; (Yom Teruah). A shofar is the rams-horn trumpet that God commanded be blown on this day. Rosh Hashanah is the start of the ten days of introspection leading up to Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. But even more interesting than Rosh Hashanah on the 1st of Tishri and Yom Kippur on the 10th of Tishri is another festival, Sukkot (&#8220;Feast of Tabernacles&#8221;) that occurs on the 15th of Tishri.   The cycle of God’s prophetic calendar actually comes together at the Feast of Tabernacles, when, we believe, Messiah Y’Shua came to &#8220;tabernacle among us&#8221; and was born in the flesh in Beit Lekhem (Bethlehem) about 2,000 years ago. So to start our study we will, for now, pass by these three occurrences in the month of Tishri, and start just after Y’Shua&#8217;s birth. As in all calendars, the end of one era is the beginning of the next, and this month of Tishri is both the beginning and the end of God’s prophetic calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Let us then continue from that point on through the prophetic year.</strong></p>
<p><strong>HANUKKAH<br />
</strong>The next festival mentioned in the Scriptures is Hanukkah. Hanukkah is not specifically mentioned in the Tanakh (Foundational Scriptures). It is mentioned prophetically in Daniel, its story is told in the Apocrypha, and it is mentioned in the Brit Hadashah (Illustrative Scriptures, &#8220;New Testament&#8221;). Hanukkah is celebrated on the 25th day of the month of Kislev, which falls approximately around the Roman month of December. Apparently it was celebrated by Y’Shua, because, as it is written in Yochanan (John) 10:22-23,  &#8220;Then came Hanukkah [or Feast of Dedication]. It was winter, and Y’Shua was walking around inside the Temple area, in Shlomo’s [Solomon’s] Colonnade.&#8221;<br />
What is the significance to the Body of Messiah of Hanukkah? It is a celebration of deliverance — of redemption.   It is also known as the &#8220;Festival of Lights&#8221; because each year in celebration of the rededication of the Temple, the Temple would be lit up as at no other time of the year. Y’Shua is the Light of the world. Hanukkah, as a celebration of rededication and redemption, points to the time when the Messiah would come to earth and be the light  which points the way to salvation. In its earthly sense it is the story of deliverance from assimilation.</p>
<p><strong>PURIM<br />
</strong>The next in the prophetic cycle is Purim, which falls on the 14th of Adar (Adar II in leap years). This is called the &#8220;Feast of Lots&#8221; because of the way that the date for the destruction of the Jewish people was picked. It is also a celebration of redemption. Its story is written in the Book of Esther. Purim is a holy day that shows that God will keep his promises and His covenant with those who love Him. Hanukkah and Purim show two sides of the most serious problem that the Jewish people and everyone who has ever loved God has had, has today, and always will have. That is the problem of assimilation. In the story of Hanukkah, we see the problem of voluntary assimilation that can be compared very easily to the recent history of the United States. In the story of Purim we see forced assimilation, where those who would not assimilate voluntarily were to be killed. This can easily be compared to the Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and other plans to exterminate the Jewish people.</p>
<p><strong>PESACH/Feast of Unleavened Bread<br />
</strong>The next redemption festival is Pesach (&#8220;Passover&#8221;), whose theme is redemption from slavery. Passover starts &#8220;between the lights&#8221; at the end of the 13th of Nisan and the beginning of the 14th of Nisan. The &#8220;Feast of Unleavened Bread&#8221; begins the evening at the start of the 15th. Both have become known collectively as Passover. Again, as prophecy it has more than one focus and purpose. In celebrating Pesach we celebrate and remember and thank God for redeeming our people from slavery in Egypt. But for us now, in the last days, Pesach represents the redemption that is available to us through God — redemption from slavery to sin. That is why on Passover God has made us focus on removing from our homes and from our lives yeast, or leaven, which represents sin.   But did the Jewish people prior to Y’Shua put this together, and understand its prophetic significance? Yes! There always has been in Jewish tradition a dual reason for eating the unleavened bread on Passover. One was because when the children of Israel had to leave Egypt in haste, there was not time for the dough that they had made to rise, to leaven, so they ended up eating flat bread. But in the first letter that Rabbi Sha’ul (known as the &#8220;Apostle Paul&#8221;) wrote to the Corinthians, in chapter 5 verses 6-8 it is written:  “Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know the [old] saying, &#8220;It takes only a little Hametz to leaven a whole batch of dough?&#8221; Get rid of the old Hametz, so that you can be a new batch of dough, because in reality you are unleavened. For our Pesach Lamb, the Messiah has been sacrificed. So let us celebrate the [Passover] seder, not with leftover hametz, the hametz of wickedness and evil, but with the matzah [unleavened bread] of purity and truth.”</p>
<p>Passover points to redemption from sin. But even more important than that, it foreshadows the way in which God was going to allow us to have complete and eternal redemption from sin! The Passover Lamb! Tell me, what sense would it have made to anyone for Yochanan (John) the Immerser (Baptizer) to proclaim of Y’Shua, &#8220;Look, the Lamb of Elohim, who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; if the lamb didn’t already represent the Messiah? And what sense would it have made to Y’Shua’s disciples for Him to show them the symbolism of His body and blood?  Redemption from assimilation both voluntary and forced — redemption from Sin — and the way to salvation.</p>
<p>The first day of the week, following the Sabbath of Passover week, is First Firstfruits, and is symbolic of redemption and salvation, making it highly important that Jesus was resurrected on this day.  This is due to the historic events associated with this particular date, which are:<br />
  Noah’s Ark comes to rest on Mount Ararat (Genesis 8:4).<br />
  Israel crosses the Red Sea (Exodus 3:18, 5:3, 5:14).<br />
  Israel eats the firstfruits of the Promised Land (Joshua 5:10-12).<br />
  Haman is defeated (Esther 3:1-6).</p>
<p><strong>Passover (Pesach, Heb.)<br />
</strong>Ex. 12:1–28, 43–49; Lev. 23:5; Num. 28:16; Deut. 16:1–8<br />
The evening of the fourteenth day of Nisan (Abib), the first month of the year (March/April).<br />
(1) To commemorate Israel’s deliverance from Egyptian bondage.<br />
(2) To remind the children of Israel that God “passed over their houses, i.e., spared the firstborn of the Israelites (Ex. 12:27)<br />
(1) Christ is our Passover (cf. John 1:29; 19:36; 1 Cor. 5:7; 1 Pet. 1:18).<br />
(2) The Passover is the foundation for the Lord’s Supper (cf. Matt. 26:17–30; Mark 14:12–25; Luke 22:1–20).<br />
(3) The Passover foreshadows the marriage supper of the Lamb (cf. Matt. 26:29; Mark 14:25; Luke 22:16–18).</p>
<p><strong>Feast of Unleavened Bread (Matzah, Heb.).<br />
</strong>Ex. 12:15-20; 13:3–10; Lev. 23:6–8; Num. 28:17–25; Deut. 16:3–8<br />
It began on the fifteenth day of Nisan (Abib) and continued for one week (March/April).<br />
To commemorate the hardships of Israel’s hurried flight from Egypt (Ex 12:39). The absence of leaven symbolized complete consecration and devotion to God.<br />
(1) Unleavened bread is a type of Christ (cf. John 6:30–59; 1 Cor. 11:24).<br />
(2) Unleavened bread is a type of the true church (cf. 1 Cor. 5:7, 8).</p>
<p><strong>Day of Firstfruits (Bikkurim, Heb.).</strong><br />
Lev. 23:9–14<br />
On the day after the Sabbath of Passover (March/April).<br />
To dedicate and consecrate the firstfruits of the barley harvest.<br />
(1) Firstfruits is a type of the bodily resurrection of Christ (cf. 1 Cor. 15:20–23).<br />
(2) Firstfruits is a guarantee of the bodily resurrection of all believers (cf. 1 Cor. 15:20–23; 1Thess. 4:13–18).<br />
(3) Firstfruits is a type of the consecration of the church.</p>
<p><strong>SHAVUOT<br />
</strong>The next festival in the prophetic calendar is Shavuot or &#8220;Pentecost.&#8221; It is called Pentecost because it is celebrated on the fiftieth day counting from &#8220;Early Firstfruits&#8221; (Bikkurim), which is the day after Sabbath during Passover. Bikkurim represents the day when Y’Shua ascended to the right hand of the Father in Heaven. Y’Shua’s resurrection is celebrated as part of the Pesach/Feast of Unleavened Bread. The historical significance of Shavuot, or &#8220;Feast of Weeks,&#8221; besides being a day of celebration and thanking God for the early harvest, is that it is believed that the Torah, God’s perfect standard for His children, the first five books of the Bible, was given then on Mount Sinai. Of course this makes sense because it is also the day on which the Ruakh HaQodesh, or &#8220;Holy Spirit,&#8221; was given to the believers in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Prophetically it represents now. It represents the time of the combined Jewish/Gentile Church, empowered by the Spirit.  This time will culminate in separation of the Godly REMNANT from the worldly FALSE CHURCH.  During this time of culmination, a number of Jews around the world will come to recognize Y’Shua as the Messiah of Israel. Also during this time the rest of the Body of Messiah will recognize the Jewish roots of their faith. It is the time of Revival in which &#8220;The TRUE Church&#8221; will begin to be pulled back to the righteousness of God.</p>
<p>Lev. 23:15–22; Num. 28:26; Deut. 16:9–12<br />
The day after the seventh Sabbath after the Day of Firstfruits (May/June).<br />
To dedicate and consecrate firstfruits of the wheat harvest.<br />
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the church occurred on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2). The two loaves, representative of the Jew and Gentile, contained leaven because sin is found within the church.</p>
<p><strong>YOM TERUAH (ROSH HASHANAH)<br />
</strong>And now  we find ourselves back at the beginning &#8211; The day of the blowing of the ram’s horn.</p>
<p>It is written in Rev 10: 7:  “But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.”   This, then, is finally the purpose and the reason behind the &#8220;Feast of Trumpets.&#8221; This is why there is not a more complete, a more symbolic meaning traditionally given. This is indeed why it is not written in the Scriptures that Y’Shua celebrated this day. The prophetic completion of this day will come when the Messiah comes back for His children. And, indeed, it will be the start of the final &#8220;Days of Awe&#8221; as the Rabbis call it – the ten days leading up to the Day of Atonement. This is the period when all of those who would stand before the Judgment Throne and have their lives opened as a book would be pondering their lives, remembering all the times they purposely broke God’s Law, forgot about God and lived a worldly, assimilated, and sinful life.</p>
<p>The following are the names associated with the festival of Rosh Hashanah from Jewish and Rabbinical writings:<br />
 Teshuvah (repentance)<br />
 Rosh Hashanah (head of the year, birthday of the world)<br />
 Yom Teruah (Day of the awakening blast, feast of trumpets)<br />
 Yom HaDin (Day of Judgment)<br />
 Ha Melech (Coronation of the Messiah)<br />
 Yom Ha Zikkaron (Day of Remembrance, or Memorial)<br />
 Time of Jacobs Trouble (also, birthpangs of the Messiah)<br />
 The opening of the gates<br />
 Kiddushin/Nesu’in (the wedding ceremony)<br />
 Natzal (the resurrection of the dead)<br />
 Shofar (the last trumpet)<br />
 Yom Hakeseh (the hidden day)</p>
<p><strong>Lev. 23:23–25; Num. 10:10; 29:1–6<br />
</strong>The first day of the seventh month (Tishri), the sabbatical month (September/October).<br />
To usher in and consecrate the seventh month as the sabbatical month.<br />
In the N.T. the blowing of the trumpet is associated with the return of our Lord (cf. Matt. 24:31; 1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thess. 4:16).</p>
<p><strong>YOM KIPPUR<br />
</strong>Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement on the 10th of Tishri then represents the judgment. Too late to seek atonement. Too late to change, to repent, to turn back to God and to live a more godly lifestyle. The world as we know it will have ended and a new era will have begun on Rosh Hashanah — the &#8220;Head of the Year&#8221; — the blowing of the final trumpet call. Eternal life for believers would have started. And only one festival of God remains.</p>
<p><strong>Lev. 16; 23:26–32; Num. 29:7–11<br />
</strong>The tenth day of the seventh month (Tishri-September/October).<br />
To make annual atonement for the sins of the priests and the people, and for the tabernacle (temple).<br />
The Day of Atonement finds its ultimate fulfillment in the crucifixion of Christ (cf. Heb 9).  It represents the redeeming work of Christ more adequately than any other O.T. type.</p>
<p><strong>SUKKOT<br />
</strong>Sukkot, the &#8220;Feast of Tabernacles&#8221; — commemorates when Yeshua came to earth the first time to redeem us from our sins, when He came to earth as the suffering servant. In its final celebration it will signify when Messiah comes as the Lion of Judah &#8211; coming to reign over the earth in the Millennium.  It is quite evident from Scripture that Jesus was born on Sukkot, rather than in December (when we celebrate Christmas).  Thus John is quite right in his Gospel when he says, “The Word became flesh and DWELT (literally, TABERNACLED) among us.”</p>
<p><strong>Names associated with Sukkot:<br />
</strong> The Season of our Joy<br />
 The Festival of Ingathering<br />
 The feast of the Nations<br />
 The Festival of Dedication<br />
 The Festival of Lights</p>
<p><strong>Lev. 23:33–43; Num. 29:12–38; Deut. 16:13–17<br />
</strong>The fifteenth through twenty-first of the seventh month (Tishri), with an eighth day added as a climax to all the feasts (September/October).<br />
 (1) To commemorate God’s deliverance and protection during the wilderness wanderings (23:43).<br />
(2) To rejoice in the completion of all the harvest (23:29).<br />
The Feast of Tabernacles foreshadows the peace and prosperity of the millennial reign of Christ (Zech. 14:16).</p>
<p>So you see &#8211; it is all there! It is all shown in the cycle we call the &#8220;Jewish Festivals.&#8221; But I want to close by showing you what God’s opinion is of whether they are only &#8220;Jewish Festivals.&#8221; God tells us about the festivals in a few places, but mainly in Leviticus chapter 23. It is written starting in verse 1:<br />
“God said to Moses, &#8220;Speak to the Yisraeli and say to them: &#8220;These are my appointed feasts, the appointed feasts of God, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.&#8221;<br />
Not only is Jesus seen in the Feasts, but He is also seen in each of the various sacrifices commanded in the Book of Leviticus.</p>
<p><strong>Typology of Sacrifice:</strong><br />
The typology of sacrifice has been much discussed. There can be no question that, from the standpoint of the New Testament, many of the sacrifices were typical. They pre-figured, and designedly so, the great sacrifice of Christ. Thus they could not really take away sin; they were in that sense unreal. But the question is, were they typical to the people of Israel? Did Moses and the priests and prophets and people understand that they were merely figures of the true Sacrifice to come, which alone could take away sin? Did they understand that their Messiah was to be sacrificed, His blood shed, to make atonement for them, and render their divinely given means of atonement all unreal? The answer must be an emphatic “No.” There is no hint that their minds were directed to think of the Coming One as their sacrifice, foreshadowed by their offerings. That was the one thing the nation could not and would not understand, and to this day the cross is their chief stumblingblock. The statement that the Servant is to be a guilt offering (Isaiah 53:10) is the nearest approach to it, but this is far from saying that the whole sacrificial system was understood as foreshadowing that event. The great prophets all speak of a sacrificial system in full vogue in the Messianic age.  We regard the sacrificial system as great religious educational system, adapted to the capacity of the people at that age, intended to develop right conceptions of sin, proper appreciation of the holiness of God, correct ideas of how to approach God, a familiarity with the idea of sacrifice as the fundamental thing in redemption, life, and service to God and man.  It is important to notice that God ordained 5 Levitical sacrifices, because 5 is the symbolic number of grace, and the sacrificial system was always an object of God’s GRACE, since it was God’s choice to allow substitutionary atonement in the first place.  Most “New Testament” Christians don’t realize that GRACE is the topic of BOTH the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p><strong>The Mosaic Sacrificial System.<br />
The Law of the Burnt Offering (Olah):<br />
</strong>The law of the burnt offering is found in Leviticus 1.  They were for the statutory individual and national offering upon the “horned” altar before the sanctuary. Already the daily burnt offerings of the priests had been provided for (Exodus 29:38-42). The burnt offering is here called qorban, “oblation.”<br />
(1) Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 1:3-17).   This may have been from the herd or flock or fowls, brought to the tent of meeting; hands were laid (heavily) upon its head designating it as the offerer’s substitute, it was killed, flayed and cut in pieces. If of the flock, it was to be killed on the north side of the altar; if a fowl, the priest must kill it.</p>
<p>(2) Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 1:3-17).   If a bullock or of the flock, the priest was to sprinkle the blood round about the altar, put on the fire, lay the wood and pieces of the carcass, wash the inwards, legs, etc., and burn it all as a sweet savor to God. If a fowl, he must wring the neck, drain out the blood on the side of the altar, cast the crop, filth, etc., among the ashes, rend the wings without dividing the bird and burn the carcass on the altar.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this offering:  We see Christ in both “sides” of this sacrifice; both God’s “side” and the sinners “side”.  For the sinner, this sacrifice deals with sin through the death of the substitute, whom the sinner must DIRECTLY IDENTIFY WITH (by placing his hands on it and praying over it).  In the same manner, we cannot be saved unless we DIRECTLY IDENTIFY with Christ as our Savior, thus applying His death to our life.  From God’s “side”, we see that Christ is the “best of the flock”, whole, and without blemish; as was necessary for this sacrifice.  Also, He is the WHOLE burnt offering, given totally to God, without reservation.</p>
<p><strong>The Law of the Meal Offering (Minchah):<br />
</strong>The term “meal offering” is here confined to offerings of flour or meal, etc.<br />
(The King James Version “meat-offering”, where the word “meat” simply means any food), and was first used at the consecration of Aaron and his sons (Exodus 29:41). These must not be offered on the altar of incense (Exodus 30:9); were used at the completion of the tabernacle (Exodus 40:29); and always with the morning and evening burnt offerings.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 2:1-16).</strong>   It must be of fine flour, with oil and frankincense added, and brought to the priest; if baked in the oven, unleavened cakes mingled with oil, or wafers and oil; if of the baking pan, fine flour mingled with oil parted into pieces and oil thereon; if of the frying pan, the same ingredients. Leaven and honey must never be used as they quickly become corrupt. Every offering must be seasoned with salt. If of the first-fruits (bikkurim), it should consist of grain in the ear, parched with oil and frankincense upon it.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 2:1-16).</strong>   This required him to take out a handful with the oil and frankincense thereon and burn it as a memorial upon the altar. The remainder was holy and belonged to the priest. Of the cakes, after bringing them to the altar, he was to take a portion, burn it and appropriate the remainder; the same with the first-fruits.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this sacrifice:  The Hebrew word for the “meal” (flour/cereal) sacrifice is “mincha”, meaning an offering from an INFERIOR to a SUPERIOR.  The word is sometimes translated as “present”, as in the story of Jacob sending “presents” to his brother Esau to forestall his wrath.  It is also used this way in the story of Joseph, when his brothers bring “presents” to Joseph (before they know he is their brother) to influence him to return their younger brother whom Joseph wants to keep.  Jesus is the “fruit of the ground”, the “ear of corn that falls to the ground and dies” producing a great harvest.  He provides FOR US the only gift that is GOOD ENOUGH for God.  We, the INFERIOR, must give gift a to God that is WORTHY of Him, but OUR righteousness is “as filthy rags”.  You wouldn’t give filthy rags as a gift to the president of the United States would you?  In Christ, we are able to give His perfection and righteousness back to God on our own behalf.  Just as in the Meal Offering, GOD had caused the grain to grow, but the offerer gave it back to Him.  GOD sent His Son into the world, and we “give Him back” to God in place our own righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>The Law of the Peace Offering:<br />
</strong>The peace offerings indicated right relations with God, expressing good-fellowship, gratitude and obligation. The common altars were fitted for their use (Exodus 20:24), as feasts had been thus celebrated from time immemorial. At the feast before God on the Mount, peace offerings provided the food (Exodus 24:5); also before the golden bull (Exodus 32:6). The wave offerings and heave offerings were portions of these.</p>
<p><strong>(1) Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 3:1-17).</strong>   The offering might be a bullock, a lamb, or a goat, either male or female, latitude being allowed in this case. The ritual was the same as in the case of the burnt offering (see above).</p>
<p><strong>(2) Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 3:1-17).</strong>   Blood must be sprinkled on the altar round about, the caul, the liver and the kidneys must be taken away and the fat parts burned on the altar; the fat tail of the lamb must also be burned. These portions were offerings of food by fire to the Deity. The ritual for a goat was the same as for a bullock.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(3) General Laws for the Priest (Leviticus 6:12 (Hebrew 5); 7:1).  The fat was to be burned on the altar of burnt offering. If it was a thank offering (zebhach ha-todhah), it must have unleavened cakes with oil, cakes mingled with oil and fine flour soaked. Cakes of leavened bread might be offered, and one cake was to be a heave offering to the priest. The flesh was to be eaten that day; none was to be left till morning (Leviticus 22:30). If it was a votive offering (zebhach nedher) or a freewill offering (zebhach nedhabhah), it might be eaten on the first and second days, but not on the third day; it should then be an abomination.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this sacrifice: This was the only sacrifice where the sinner and the priest would eat part of it together, initiating the common bond of hospitality (which was crucially important in Middle Eastern thinking).  This sacrifice was the Old Testament equivalent of COMMUNION.  When we come to the Lord’s Table to share in Communion, we are “feasting” (symbolically) on what God has provided, and we acknowledge that we are at peace with God through Jesus Christ.  See Luke 2:14, Colossians 1:20, Ephesians 2:14.</p>
<p><strong>The Law of the Sin Offering:<br />
</strong>The sin offering was a sacrifice of a special kind, doubtless peculiar to Israel and first mentioned at the consecration of Aaron and his sons. It is not then spoken of as an innovation. It was of special value as an expiatory sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>The Law of the Sin Offering (Leviticus 4:1-35; 24-30, etc.).<br />
(1) The Occasion and Meaning:<br />
</strong>Specifically to atone for unwitting sins, sins of error (sheghaghah),<br />
mistakes or rash acts, unknown at the time, but afterward made known.<br />
There were gradations of these for several classes of offenders: the<br />
anointed priest (Leviticus 4:3-12), the whole congregation (Leviticus 4:13-21), a ruler (Leviticus 4:22-26), one of the common people (Leviticus 4:27-35), forswearing (5:1), touching an unclean thing (Leviticus 5:2) or the uncleanness of man (Leviticus 5:3), or rashly sweating in ignorance (Leviticus 5:4). For conscious and willful violations of the Law, no atonement was possible, with some exceptions, for which provision was made in the guilt offerings.</p>
<p><strong>(2) Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 4:1-5,13, etc.):<br />
</strong>The anointed priest must offer a bullock at the tent of meeting, lay his hands upon it and slay it before Yahweh. The congregation was also required to bring a young bullock before the tent of meeting, the elders were to lay hands upon it and slay it before Yahweh. The ruler must bring a he-goat and do the same. One of the common people might bring a she-goat or lamb and present it in the same manner. If too poor for these, two turtledoves or young pigeons, one for a sin offering and one for burnt offering, would suffice. If too poor for these, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour without oil or frankincense would suffice.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 4:1-5,13, etc.):<br />
</strong>He must bring the bullock’s blood to the tent of meeting, dip his finger into it and sprinkle blood 7 times before the veil of the sanctuary, and put some on the horns of the altar of incense, but most of the blood must be poured out at the base of the altar. The fat must be burned upon the altar, all the rest of the carcass must be carried to a clean place without the camp and burned. In the case of the whole congregation, the ritual is the same. In the case of a ruler, the blood is to be put upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, not the altar of incense. In the case of one of the common people, the ritual is similar to that of the ruler. In both the latter cases the carcass belonged to the priest. If a bird, the priest must wring off its head, sprinkle some blood on the side of the altar and pour the rest at the base. Nothing is said of the disposal of the carcass. If of fine flour, the priest must take out a handful and burn it upon the altar, keeping the remainder for himself. The use of fine flour for an expiatory sacrifice is evidently exceptional and<br />
intended to be so. Though life was not given, yet necessity of life — that which represented life — was offered.</p>
<p><strong>(4) General Laws for the Priest (Leviticus 6:24-30):<br />
</strong>The sin offering was to be slain in the same place as the burnt offering. It was most holy, and the priest alone might eat what was left of the ram, pigeon or flour, in the holy place. Whatever touched it was to be holy, any garment sprinkled with the blood must be washed in a holy place, earthen vessels used must be broken, and brazen vessels thoroughly scoured and rinsed.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this sacrifice: Jesus is indeed our SIN OFFERING, making atonement for us in His death.  See Romans 8:3, 2nd Corinthians 5:21.</p>
<p>The Guilt Offering:<br />
The guilt offering (the King James Version “trespass offering”) (Leviticus 5:14 through 6:7) was a special kind of sin offering, always of a private character and accompanied by a fine. It expressed expiation and restitution. The classes of sin requiring a guilt offering with reparation in money are:</p>
<p>(1) a trespass in the holy things done unwittingly;</p>
<p>(2) anything which the Law forbade depriving God or the priest of their<br />
due;</p>
<p>(3) dealing falsely, with a neighbor in a deposit, or pledge, or robbery,<br />
or oppression;</p>
<p>(4) swearing falsely regarding anything lost;</p>
<p>(5) seduction of a betrothed bondmaid (Leviticus 19:20-22). The<br />
first two of these are unwitting sins, the others cannot be.</p>
<p><strong>The Ritual (Leviticus 5:14 through 6:7).<br />
</strong>A ram proportionate in value to the offense and worth at least two shekels is required. The ritual is probably the same as that of the sin offering, though no mention is made of the laying on of hands, and the blood is not brought into the sanctuary, but sprinkled about the base of the altar, the fat and inside parts being burned, and the flesh eaten by the priests in a holy place.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this sacrifice:  See Isaiah 53:8, 2nd Corinthians 5:19, Colossians 2:13-14.  We have ALL sinned and come short of the glory of God, and are GUILTY of treason (against our Creator), filthiness (spiritually), and sin.  Only in Christ can our guilt (trespass) be cleansed.</p>
<p>The Mosaic sacrifices given in Leviticus show the life, death, and ministry of Christ in its’ various facets.  The entire story is one of God showing grace to mankind, making provision for our sin to be cleansed, and providing a way for sinners to have fellowship with the Holy and Righteous God.  Christ is the True Sacrifice, that living Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</p>
<p>And so we come to end our journey through the Old Testament.  At every turn, we have seen Jesus.  He is Creator, proclaimed in the stars, announced in the genealogy of the first ten generations of mankind, the “Angel of the Lord” who interacted with mankind on numerous occasions, and the focus of every feast and every sacrifice commanded by God. </p>
<p>The entire story of the Bible in BOTH Testaments is the story of Jesus, our Savior, Lord, and King.  AMEN!</p>

<h4>Introduction and The Foundation in Genesis</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Introduction</span>:  In the British Navy there is a scarlet thread running through every line of cordage, and though a rope is cut into inch pieces, it can be recognized as belonging to the Government. There is also a scarlet thread running all through the Bible — the whole book points to Christ and His shed blood.  If you read your Bible carefully, you will see the scarlet thread running right through every page. The “trail of blood” begins in Genesis, and runs on to Revelation. God’s was written to tell the story of the scarlet thread. Take it out, and the book would not be worth carrying home.<span id="more-1186"></span></p>
<p>First and foremost is the Divine Plan of Redemption.  In the Scriptures the Plan of Redemption is central and fundamental. In Genesis we have recorded the Creation and Fall of man to show that he has the capacity for, and is in need of, redemption.  Next we find the promise of the Redeemer. Then follows a system of sacrifices and offerings that represent pictorially the nature of redemption and the condition under which salvation is realized.  At the commencement of the New Testament we have the four Gospels which set forth the basis of Redemption, namely, the Incarnation, Life, Death, Resurrection and Ascension of the Redeemer; Jesus, The Son of God. Next comes the Book of the Acts and the Epistles that illustrate again and again the Power of Redemption, showing that it is adequate to work its great results in the salvation of both Jew and Gentile. Finally, in the Revelation, we are shown the ultimate triumphs of redemption, the Goal of Salvation — the redeemed dwelling with God in perfect union and communion.</p>
<h4>This scarlet thread is a thread of blood.  Blood is mentioned hundreds of times in the Bible, throughout both the Old and New Testaments.  The nature of man’s life is found in the blood; the price for sin is blood; atonement for sin comes only through the blood of the Messiah; and the blood reaches from the depths of hell to the courts of heaven. </h4>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Let’s begin to follow the weaving of the “scarlet thread” through the Scriptures…..</strong></p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Foundation In Genesis:  Read Genesis 3:1-21.</strong></span></em></p>
<p>An important lesson in Bible Study is called “the law of first mention”.  As a general rule, the FIRST time that God introduces a concept in His Word, it will be shown in its’ deepest meaning, and every mention of that concept after that will serve to clarify (or provide examples) of that concept.  Although the actual mention of the shedding of blood in this portion is brief (and the word “blood” isn’t even directly mentioned), this portion lays the foundation for every other mention of blood and sacrifice in the whole of Scripture.</p>
<p><strong>THE PROBLEM:  WHAT IS SIN?</strong></p>
<p>The disobedience of God’s Word and/or will.</p>
<p><strong>THE CONSEQUENCE:  WHAT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY?</strong></p>
<p>Adam and Eve experienced guilt, shame, and fear for the first time.  Adam begins to lie to God, and tries to shift the blame to Eve and to God Himself.  By hiding, they were separated from God.  They lost the SHEKINAH glory that had covered them, and were exposed (naked).  One Bible Commentator (William Law, “Christian Regeneration”, page 5) puts it this way:</p>
<p>“This is plainly taught us in the holy scripture, where it is said of our first parents in paradise, before the fall, that “they were naked, and were not ashamed.” And again, after the fall it is said, “their eyes were opened,” and “they saw they were naked,” and through shame sought for a covering.  It is not said, they saw their nakedness in paradise, but that though they were naked, that is, had such bodies as afterwards appeared to be naked, yet they were not ashamed, and the reason of their not being ashamed, was because that nakedness was not then visible, could not then show itself, but was concealed and covered from them by their paradisaical glory; but as soon as by sin, they died to the paradisaical life and glory, then they saw their nakedness, which sight filled them with shame and confusion.”</p>
<p> The word translated as “naked”  (Hebrew “EYROM, Strong’s #5903) in this portion not only means “bare” or “unclothed”, but also is derived from a word that has nothing to do with clothing.  The “root word” (Hebrew “ARAM”, Strong’s #6191) means to be cunning, to deal in a subtle manner, both in a derogatory sense.  When Adam and Eve became “naked”, they not only lost their Shekinah glory and innocence, but they lost their “openness” and truthfulness.  They tried to remedy the situation themselves by making aprons of leaves, but these were not sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>THE SOLUTION:  WHAT DID GOD DO?</strong></p>
<p>God made them “coats” or “aprons” of skin to cover their nakedness.  The word translated as “covered them” is “IBONAH” (Strong’s #3843), which literally means “to make white”.  Thus we see that God Himself made the first sacrifice by killing an innocent animal to hide the nakedness of fallen humanity, and to “make them white” by the shedding of the blood.  When we realize that the Person of the Trinity who was “walking in the garden” with Adam and Eve, and who would have been the one to kill the animal, skin it, and make the “coats” of skin, had to be Jesus Himself, we see the depth of this “first mention”.   The consequence of sin is always death and the shedding of blood; either directly, or of a substitute.  Can you imagine what Adam and Eve must have thought as they watched the God who had walked in the garden with them take an innocent animal, perhaps even one with which they were familiar, and killed it, skinned it, and fashioned robes, or clothes, for them?  The sight of the blood upon the ground would surely speak to them of the consequences of sin.</p>
<p><strong>THE PROMISE:  WHAT DID GOD SAY?</strong></p>
<p>Notice that the “seed of the woman” will crush the head of the serpent (Satan).  Although it will not happen immediately, final victory over sin will be found in the sacrifice of the Messiah.</p>
<h4>Lesson 2:</h4>
<h4>The Blood Cries Out, Is Prohibited To Man, And Establishes A Covenant</h4>
<h4>Read Genesis 4:1-12</h4>
<p>Cain’s offering was given from an impure heart, since he gave only “an offering” when Abel gave of “the firstlings of the flock, and the fat”.  When he was rebuked by God for this, his response was to kill his brother.  Notice verse 10, which states that the blood “cries out” from the ground to God.  The shedding of innocent blood is a sin that cries out to God, because the life is in the blood.  God alone is the giver of human life, and anyone who destroys that life has sinned against God (see Psalm 51:1-4).  What does this say about the fact that our sin placed Jesus on the Cross?  What about our modern culture that has killed literally MILLIONS of innocent babies through abortion? </p>
<h4>Read Genesis 9:1-7</h4>
<p>God establishes the importance of human blood in his commands to Noah.  Any animal that sheds human blood is to be killed, and any murderer is to be killed.  Both of these commands are based on the fact that human beings are made in the image of God, and that “shedding the blood” (killing a person) destroys that image.  The eating of meat with blood is prohibited, as is the use of blood for food in any way.  These commands are also the basis for the first human government, in that society is charged with the execution of murderers.  Homicide (which in a sense is always fratricide (that is, the killing of your brother, just as in the story of Cain and Abel), v. 5) demands a punishment that matches the crime. The justification for capital punishment, here established, is the nobility of human life, which is made <em>in the image of God</em>. It is not instituted primarily as a deterrent for crime, but as a strong reminder of the uniqueness of man.  Notice that animals are acceptable as food, and can be killed.  No matter what the radical enviromental movement and the evolutionists would tell you, man is different; not just an evolved animal.  In addition to the concept of murder, the concept of suicide is dealt with in this portion.  Man must not take away his own life: <em>Your blood of your lives will I require,</em> v. 5. Our lives are not so our own, but they are God’s and we must live until HE PLEASES to take us home.  If we hasten our own deaths, we are accountable to God for it.</p>
<p>Notice that the killing of mere men brings death, but the killing of the Divine Man (Christ) brought life.</p>
<h4>Read Genesis 15:1-20</h4>
<p>For the first time, God uses blood to establish a covenant.  The sacrifices that Abraham is commanded to kill are reminiscent of the Mosaic sacrifices that ranged from the wealthiest (a heifer) to the poorest (a pigeon).</p>
<p>The “deep sleep” (<em>tardemah, </em>Heb.) is the same word used to describe the state of Adam when God took a part of his side to make Eve (2:21).  The significance of Abram’s sleep is that he did not participate in the covenant ceremony. The focus of the covenant, therefore, was upon the promises of God.  Though a human covenant usually assumes a reciprocal relation between two free parties, this covenant made by God with a man is one in which the man was not placed on an equal plane with God, who in fact must condescend in grace to come to the man.  Man was merely a recipient of the gift of God, and his sole qualification was a willingness to receive God’s gift of mercy. </p>
<p>The fire that passed between the pieces of the sacrificed animals is the same that appeared to the Jews in the Exodus (see Exodus 13:21-22), and is the presence of God Himself in the Spirit.  That this “fire” consumed the pieces testifies of God’s acceptance of the sacrifices Abraham had made, as seen in other times when this occurred: Gideon’s (Judges 6:21), Manoah’s (Judges 13:19, 20), and Solomon’s (2<sup>nd</sup>  Chronicles 7:1).  It teaches us  (1.) That God’s covenants with man are made by sacrifice (Psalm 50:5), by Christ, the great sacrifice.  (2.) God’s acceptance of sacrifice is a token for good and an earnest (or “downpayment”) of further favors (see Judges 13:23).</p>
<h4>Lesson 3:</h4>
<h4>Abraham’s Son, And The First Passover</h4>
<h4>Read Genesis 22:1-19</h4>
<p>God tested Abraham in the command to offer Isaac as a sacrifice. God does not tempt (or test) anyone with evil (James 1:13); but in certain instances, He does test, try, or prove us (James 1:2; 1<sup>st</sup> Peter 1:6–7).  God in His omniscience had always known the heart of Abraham, but here He gave Abraham an opportunity to demonstrate his faith, so that ABRAHAM would know.. Abraham, advancing up the slope, where Solomon’s temple later stood, felt something of the agony of the Heavenly Father sacrificing His only Son, Jesus. At the summit of Moriah, the type changes, and Isaac is a type of all lost and condemned men, for whom a substitute ram, representative of Christ, was sacrificed.</p>
<p>“The-Lord-Will-Provide” is a play on the verb translated “provided.” The verb means basically “see,” as the English word “provide” is from the Latin, meaning “see beforehand.” God sees our need before it arises and makes provision for it.  Had not Abraham been sustained by the full consciousness of acting in obedience to God’s will, the effort would have been too great for human endurance; and had not Isaac (then upwards of twenty years of age) displayed equal faith in submitting, this great trial could not have been completed.﻿ ﻿</p>
<p>Isaac was Abraham’s <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">unique</span></strong> son; and when the New Testament refers to Isaac (Hebrews 11:17), it calls him his only begotten (<em>monogenes</em>). It is clear that the expression “only begotten” refers to status. Thus, when Christ is referred to as “the only begotten” it is a reference to his status as the unique Son of the Father; it does not signify that he had a beginning.</p>
<p>Thus, this portion of the “scarlet thread” shows us that the sacrifice is representative of the “Son”, and that the sacrifice must be appropriated by FAITH.  Also, the promise of ressurection is seen here as well.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Read Exodus 12:1-13</span></strong></p>
<p>First God told <strong>Moses and Aaron </strong>about the time of the Passover. This feast was to mark a new age in the history of Israel (<strong>the first month, the first month of your year</strong>). Though the events in this chapter occurred in the seventh month according to the civil year (which began in September-October) this is the first month in Israel’s religious calendar.</p>
<p>The tenth plague was the death of either the firstborn (of both man and beast, symbolic of man and all creation) or a substitutionary lamb.  Each individual was to partake of the lamb, but the feast was for families, and the entire nation acted simultaneously to observe it.  The blood of the spotless sacrifice (1st Peter 1:19) was put on the top and at the two sides of the door. Thus they were symbolizing the cross itself in this act. This was done by faith (Hebrews 11:28).  Externally, it was the actual blood that saved them from the death angel. Internally, this substitution was appropriated through obedient, humble, submissive faith.</p>
<p><strong>“thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet”, </strong>as prepared for a journey. The first was done by the skirts of the loose outer cloth being drawn up and fastened in the girdle, so as to leave the leg and knee free for motion. As to the other, the Orientals (both Middle-Eastern and Far Eastern) never wear shoes indoors, and the ancient Egyptians, as appears from the monuments, did not usually wear either shoes or sandals.  The Passover was the beginning of a journey.  For us, salvation is not an ending, a time for stopping and being content with where we are; but it is a beginning, a time to follow the Lord for the rest of our lives, obeying Him in all things, and trusting Him to lead us.</p>
<p>There is a progression of doctrine regarding the sacrificing of a lamb.</p>
<p>(1)   In Genesis the lamb was slain for the individual (Genesis 4:4).</p>
<p>(2)   In Exodus it was slain for the family (house), (Exodus 12:3–4).</p>
<p>(3)   In Leviticus the lamb was slain for the nation (Leviticus 16).</p>
<p>(4)   In the New Testament the Lamb of God was slain for the sin of the world (John 1:29).</p>
<p>They had to <strong>kill it</strong> and <strong>take of the blood</strong> to apply it to the door as God had specified (on the side and top doorposts). Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins (Hebrews 9:22).  Christ has shed His precious blood for our redemption, but it is ineffective until each sinner makes the application personally to his own soul by believing Jesus died, was buried, and rose again for him.  Likewise, the Israelite could not be saved from the death angel simply by killing the lamb. <strong>The blood</strong> had to be properly applied.</p>
<p><strong>“When I see the blood, I will pass over you.” </strong> The applied blood was the evidence of an obedient and prepared household. It fulfilled the divine demand for blood atonement and prefigured the blood of Christ shed for our sins.  Just as the blood of the PASSOVER saved the Israelites FROM something, so it is for us; see John 3:17-18.</p>
<h4>Lesson 4: The Mosaic Sacrifices</h4>
<p>It is important to notice that God ordained 5 Levitical sacrifices, because 5 is the symbolic number of grace, and the sacrificial system was always an object of God’s GRACE, since it was God’s choice to allow substitutionary atonement in the first place.  Most “New Testament” Christians don’t realize that GRACE is the topic of BOTH the Old and New Testaments.  4 of the 5 sacrifices involved the shedding of blood, while the 5<sup>th</sup> (the MEAL or MINCHA offering was made with flour or grain).  We will look only at the “blood-sacrifices” in this lesson.  We should note that a “DAILY” offering of a lamb at morning and at evening had been commanded in addition to these “blood-sacrifices” (Exodus 29:38-42), so the actual total of sacrifices of blood is still 5 (showing GRACE).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Law of the Burnt Offering (Olah):</span></strong></p>
<p>The law of the burnt offering is found in Leviticus 1.  They were for the statutory individual and national offering upon the “horned” altar before the sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>(1) </strong>Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 1:3-17).   This may have been from the herd or flock or fowls, brought to the tent of meeting; hands were laid (heavily) upon its head designating it as the offerer’s substitute, it was killed, flayed and cut in pieces. If of the flock, it was to be killed on the north side of the altar; if a fowl, the priest must kill it.</p>
<p><strong>(2) </strong>Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 1:3-17).   If a bullock or of the flock, the priest was to sprinkle the blood round about the altar, put on the fire, lay the wood and pieces of the carcass, wash the inwards, legs, etc., and burn it all as a sweet savor to God. If a fowl, he must wring the neck, drain out the blood on the side of the altar, cast the crop, filth, etc., among the ashes, rend the wings without dividing the bird and burn the carcass on the altar.</p>
<p><strong>Christ seen in this offering:  </strong>We see Christ in both “sides” of this sacrifice; both God’s “side” and the sinners “side”.  For the sinner, this sacrifice deals with sin through the death of the substitute, whom the sinner must DIRECTLY IDENTIFY WITH (by placing his hands on it and praying over it).  In the same manner, we cannot be saved unless we DIRECTLY IDENTIFY with Christ as our Savior, thus applying His death to our life.  From God’s “side”, we see that Christ is the “best of the flock”, whole, and without blemish; as was necessary for this sacrifice.  Also, He is the WHOLE burnt offering, given totally to God, without reservation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Law of the Peace Offering:</span></strong></p>
<p>The peace offerings indicated right relations with God, expressing good-fellowship, gratitude and obligation. The common altars were fitted for</p>
<p>their use (Exodus 20:24), as feasts had been thus celebrated from time</p>
<p>immemorial. At the feast before God on the Mount, peace offerings provided the food (Exodus 24:5); also before the golden bull (Exodus 32:6). The wave offerings and heave offerings were portions of these.</p>
<p><strong>(1) </strong>Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 3:1-17).   The offering might be a bullock, a lamb, or a goat, either male or female, latitude being allowed in this case. The ritual was the same as in the case of the burnt offering (see above).</p>
<p><strong>(2) </strong>Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 3:1-17).   Blood must be sprinkled on the altar round about, the caul, the liver and the kidneys must be taken away and the fat parts burned on the altar; the fat tail of the lamb must also be burned. These portions were offerings of food by fire to the Deity. The ritual for a goat was the same as for a bullock.</p>
<p><strong>(3) </strong>General Laws for the Priest (Leviticus 6:12 (Hebrew 5); 7:1).</p>
<p>The fat was to be burned on the altar of burnt offering. If it was a thanks offering <em>(zebhach ha-todha</em>h), it must have unleavened cakes with oil, cakes mingled with oil and fine flour soaked. Cakes of leavened bread might be offered, and one cake was to be a heave offering to the priest.  The flesh was to be eaten that day; none was to be left till morning</p>
<p>(Leviticus 22:30). If it was a votive (remembrance) offering <em>(zebhach nedhe</em>r) or a freewill offering <em>(zebhach nedhabha</em>h), it might be eaten on the first and second days, but not on the third day; it should then be an abomination.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Christ seen in this sacrifice: </strong>This was the only sacrifice where the sinner and the priest would eat part of it together, initiating the common bond of hospitality (which was crucially important in Middle Eastern thinking).  This sacrifice was the Old Testament equivalent of COMMUNION.  When we come to the Lord’s Table to share in Communion, we are “feasting” (symbolically) on what God has provided, and we acknowledge that we are at peace with God through Jesus Christ.  See Luke 2:14, Colossians 1:20, Ephesians 2:14.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Law of the Sin Offering:</span></strong></p>
<p>The sin offering was a sacrifice of a special kind, first mentioned at the consecration of Aaron and his sons.  (Leviticus 4:1-35; 24-30, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>(1) </strong>The Occasion and Meaning:</p>
<p>Specifically to atone for unwitting sins, sins of error <em>(sheghagha</em>h), mistakes or rash acts, unknown at the time, but afterward made known. There were “levels” of these for several classes of offenders: the anointed priest (Leviticus 4:3-12), the whole congregation (Leviticus 4:13-21), a ruler (Leviticus 4:22-26), one of the common people (Leviticus 4:27-35), forswearing (5:1), touching an unclean thing (Leviticus 5:2) or the uncleanness of man (Leviticus 5:3), or rashly swearing in ignorance (Leviticus 5:4). For conscious and willful violations of the Law, no atonement was possible, with some exceptions, for which provision was made in the guilt offerings.</p>
<p><strong>(2) </strong>Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 4:1-5,13, etc.):</p>
<p>The anointed priest must offer a bullock at the tent of meeting, lay his hands upon it and slay it before Yahweh. The congregation was also required to bring a young bullock before the tent of meeting, the elders were to lay hands upon it and slay it before Yahweh. The ruler must bring a he-goat and do the same. One of the common people might bring a she-goat or lamb and present it in the same manner. If too poor for these, two turtledoves or young pigeons, one for a sin offering and one for burnt offering, would suffice. If too poor for these, the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour without oil or frankincense would suffice.</p>
<p><strong>(3) </strong>Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 4:1-5,13, etc.):</p>
<p>He must bring the bullock’s blood to the tent of meeting, dip his finger into it and sprinkle blood 7 times before the veil of the sanctuary, and put some on the horns of the altar of incense, but most of the blood must be poured out at the base of the altar. The fat must be burned upon the altar, all the rest of the carcass must be carried to a clean place without the camp and burned. In the case of the whole congregation, the ritual is the same. In the case of a ruler, the blood is to be put upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, not the altar of incense. In the case of one of the common people, the ritual is similar to that of the ruler. In both the latter cases the carcass belonged to the priest. If a bird, the priest must wring off its head, sprinkle some blood on the side of the altar and pour the rest at the base. Nothing is said of the disposal of the carcass. If of fine flour, the priest must take out a handful and burn it upon the altar, keeping the remainder for himself. The use of fine flour for an expiatory sacrifice is evidently exceptional and intended to be so. Though life was not given, yet necessity of life — that which represented life — was offered.</p>
<p><strong>(4) </strong>General Laws for the Priest (Leviticus 6:24-30):</p>
<p>The sin offering was to be slain in the same place as the burnt offering. It was most holy, and the priest alone might eat what was left of the ram, pigeon or flour, in the holy place. Whatever touched it was to be holy, any garment sprinkled with the blood must be washed in a holy place, earthen vessels used must be broken, and brazen vessels thoroughly scoured and rinsed.</p>
<p><strong>Christ seen in this sacrifice: </strong>Jesus is indeed our SIN OFFERING, making atonement for us in His death.  See Romans 8:3, 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 5:21.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Guilt Offering:</span></strong></p>
<p>The guilt offering (the King James Version “trespass offering”) (Leviticus 5:14 through 6:7) was a special kind of sin offering, always of a private character and accompanied by a fine. It expressed expiation and restitution. The classes of sin requiring a guilt offering with reparation in money are:</p>
<p><strong>(1) </strong>a trespass in the holy things done unwittingly;</p>
<p><strong>(2) </strong>anything which the Law forbade depriving God or the priest of their</p>
<p>due;</p>
<p><strong>(3) </strong>dealing falsely, with a neighbor in a deposit, or pledge, or robbery, or oppression;</p>
<p><strong>(4) </strong>swearing falsely regarding anything lost;</p>
<p><strong>(5) </strong>seduction of a betrothed bondmaid (Leviticus 19:20-22). The</p>
<p>first two of these are unwitting sins, the others cannot be.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ritual (Leviticus 5:14 through 6:7).</strong></p>
<p>A ram proportionate in value to the offense and worth at least two shekels is required. The ritual is probably the same as that of the sin offering, though no mention is made of the laying on of hands, and the blood is not brought into the sanctuary, but sprinkled about the base of the altar, the fat and inside parts being burned, and the flesh eaten by the priests in a holy place.</p>
<p><strong>Christ seen in this sacrifice:  </strong>See Isaiah 53:8, 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 5:19, Colossians 2:13-14.  We have ALL sinned and come short of the glory of God, and are GUILTY of treason (against our Creator), filthiness (spiritually), and sin.  Only in Christ can our guilt (trespass) be cleansed.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SUMMARY:</span></strong><strong>  </strong>The Mosaic sacrifices given in Leviticus show the life, death, and ministry of Christ in its’ various facets.  The entire story is one of God showing grace to mankind, making provision for our sin to be cleansed, and providing a way for sinners to have fellowship with the Holy and Righteous God.  Christ is the True Sacrifice, that living Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</p>
<h4>Lesson 5:   The Judges Of Israel,  The Dedication Of The Temple,  God Empowers The Prophet, The Declaration Of God’s Final Judgement Upon The Nations</h4>
<h4> Judges 2:7-19</h4>
<p>The time of the Judges of Israel was a time when God showed His continued mercy to His People, even though they repeatedly disobeyed Him and followed other gods.  God would allow the Jews to be oppressed until they would remember Him and cry out to Him.  He would then send a Spirit-led Judge who would bring the people back to freedom.  The “Scarlet Thread” in the history of the Judges is not a story of religious sacrifices, but rather of warfare, with God’s Judges leading His people to victory.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1<sup>st</sup> Kings 8:54-66</span></strong></p>
<p>The Scarlet Thread continues in the Book of Kings, where Solomon makes sacrifice for the dedication of the Temple.  By commanding that a permanent dwelling place be constructed, God shows His intention to “dwell among” His People on a permanent basis.  This will be fulfilled at the end of the Millenium, when God’s eternal dwelling will be with Man (Revelation 21-22).</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1<sup>st</sup> Kings 18:20-40</span></strong></p>
<p>God overpowers the priests of the false god, Baal, and shows the true power of His prophet, Elijah.  God shows that He DOES continue to speak to His People, in spite of their continued desire to worship idols.  He sends annointed prophets, and answers true worship with His fire and power.  God IS, and will continue to be, victorious over the idols of Satan.  God’s Spirit-empowered people continue to bring His word, and continue to see that God accepts their offerings in worship.</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Isaiah 34:1-17</span></h4>
<p>The Lord foretells of the “Day of the Lord”, when His judgement will be poured out upon the nations of the earth.  The Scarlet Thread is not only GOOD NEWS for the Redeemed, it is BAD NEWS for the wicked.  God is the righteous judge, and He will not only reward the righteous, but He will also judge and destroy those who live in evil.</p>
<h4>Lesson 6:  The Lord In Judgment and Salvation, True Worship and False, The King, Coming With Salvation, The Lord’s Supper is Instituted</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Lord In Judgment and Salvation (Isaiah 63:1-6)</span></p>
<p>In one of the most visual images of the Old Testament, we see The Lord Himself treading the winepress of judgement upon the peoples of the earth, but He is also identified in verse 1 as the “mighty to save”.  In the midst of the judgement, His own arm worked salvation for the redeemed.  Notice that the “day of judgement” and the “year of the redeemed” occurs at the same time.  Thus the “winepress of blood” is GOOD news for the redeemed, and BAD news for the un-redeemed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>True Worship and False (Isaiah 66:1-4)</strong></span></p>
<p>In this section we see that God’s acceptance of sacrifices is based on the attitude and heart of the offerer.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Coming King, Coming With Salvation (Zecheriah 9:9-17)</strong></span></p>
<p>In this Messianic prophecy, we see the True King coming to His people in humility, bringing peace.  He will defend them in battle in a miraculous way (which we may see in the very near future, depending on how Iraq acts in this new war).  The reason that He will do this for His people (in spite of their failure to always obey Him) is because “of the blood of your covenant”.  The covenant of blood is considered binding by God, and He will fulfill its’ “contractual obligations” on His part.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The Lord’s Supper is Instituted (Matthew 26:26-29)</strong></span></p>
<p>﻿Jesus draws on the picture of the Passover ceremony to announce that a NEW COVENANT is to be instituted in HIS blood.  It is a continuation of the OLD covenant in that it brings life, and saves from the judgement of God upon the unholy; but it is NEW in that it is not based on ANIMAL blood that could only produce “covering” of sin (temporarily stopping it), but is rather based on the blood of the sinless Son of God, which will CLEANSE away the sin totally.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lesson 7:  Brought Near By The Blood, Holy In His Sight, The Perfect Sacrifice</span></strong></p>
<h4>Ephesians 2:11-17</h4>
<p>The Apostle Paul deals with the expansion of the covenant to include those who were not included under the original covenant.  Now, even those who have not been included by being a part of “the commonwealth of Israel”, and who have had no hope of any relationship with God, are brought near to God in Jesus Christ.  A person no longer has to enter God’s Family through the rituals of Judaism, but can be washed and adopted through Jesus alone.  The enmity between Jew and Gentile is resolved by them both being made into one NEW man, “Christian”.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Colossians 1:19-23</strong></span></p>
<p>Paul reminds the church at Colossae that Jesus is our true “Peace Offering”.  We, sinful traitors who have rebelled against our Creator, are reconciled to God Jesus.  Not only are we reconciled, but we are changed in character and position from “sinner” to “holy, blameless, and above reproach”.  Not only is fallen humanity reconciled, but all of creation, which has been tainted by sin, is reconciled to a holy God.</p>
<h4>Hebrews 9:11-10:22</h4>
<p>In this section, the true fulfillment and meaning of the entire Old Testament sacrificial system is given.  The entire Priesthood was a preparation, a “dress rehearsal” for the True High Priest.  The system of animal sacrifices was a prelude to the Perfect Sacrifice.  The earthly Tabernacle was a symbol and model of the True Tabernacle, the Throne of God in heaven.  The Old Testament sacrifices could make a temporary covering for sin, but Jesus shed blood is the perfect sacrifice that can actually REMOVE sin completely.  The entire system of “washings”, sacrifices, regulations of cleanliness, and so on (that had to be repeated often) find their ultimate fulfillment in the one, single act of atonement of Jesus Christ, The Son of God, giving Himself willingly to die on the Cross.  This is the focal point to which the entire Old Testament points.</p>
<h4>Lesson 8:  The Final Threads</h4>
<h4>Hebrews 12:22-29</h4>
<p>In the book of Genesis, Abel’s sacrifice was accounted as worthy, and was seen as righteous.  However, even his worthy sacrifice could atone for only him.  However, Jesus’ sacrifice provides atonement for ALL who repent, and who believe (trust) Him.  His sacrifice makes us members of the “church of the firstborn”.  The broadness of God’s grace is the reason for the severity of His judgement, in that He has given us the life of His own Son to provide fallen humanity with salvation, and it is an absolute rejection of God in the most insulting terms to reject His grace. </p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1<sup>st</sup> Peter 1:3-20</span></em></strong></p>
<p>The greatness of our inheritance that has been bought by the blood is so far beyond any level of our trials on earth that it is not even worthy of comparison.  The majesty of God’s gift of His Son is such that all of the Old Testament prophets, and even the angels themselves, sought to understand it, and couldn’t.  As a result of our obtaining this grace, we should live lives that show that we understand that we have been given the greatest gift of all.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1<sup>st</sup> John 5:1-14</span></em></strong></p>
<p>One of the three witnesses in heaven on our behalf is the Blood of Jesus.  The exclusivity of the Gospel is an important point:  He who has the Son has life, He who DOESN’T have the Son DOES NOT HAVE LIFE.  No matter what people may say regarding how THEY plan to get to heaven, if it is not in the shed blood of Jesus Christ, IT WON’T HAPPEN.  Also, God’s covenant is such that you can know with absolute assurance that you DO or DO NOT have life.  We don’t have to wonder, worry, or fret.</p>
<h4>Revelation 5:1-10</h4>
<p>The fulfillment of history is found in the fact that Jesus alone is worthy to open the scroll of world events leading to the redemption of all creation; and He is worthy because He shed His blood as the sacrifice for sin to redeem all of creation.  Notice that those who have been redeemed have been made both PRIESTS (to serve and minister) and KINGS (to rule and reign).</p>
<h4>Revelation 19:11-16</h4>
<p>We find the end of the “Scarlet Thread” in this portion of Scripture.  Jesus, who shed the first blood in Genesis for Adam and Eve to cover the sin that they were led into by Satan, now comes to shed the final blood to end the rebellion in creation that was spawned by Satan.  Jesus is the victor in the conflict, and the plan of redemption is brought to a close by the eradication of death and hell, sin and Satan.  He who was judged a criminal, and crucified, now renders judgement on the universe itself.  He is truly “KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Lesson 1:  Introduction</h4>
<p>Romans 12:1-2   “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”<span id="more-1184"></span></p>
<p>Before we begin to look at the subject of how our mind is renewed as a Christian, we need to look at specifically WHAT Paul is talking about when he gives this command.  It is obvious from verse 1 that Paul is talking to fellow believers (brethren) about how they are to serve God as disciples now that they are saved people.  They are to begin by giving themselves completely to God as a LIVING sacrifice (as opposed to the O.T. slaughtered sacrifices).  At the same time, they are to MOVE AWAY from conformity to this world, and to be TRANSFORMED by having their minds renewed (literally, made new).  So, what does all of this mean?</p>
<p>Serious and devout consideration of the mercies of God, as they have been set forth in the first 11 chapters of Romans, leads to only one conclusion—we should present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God. Our “bodies” stand for all our parts and, by extension, our entire lives.   Total commitment is our reasonable service. It is our reasonable service in this sense: if the Son of God has died for me, then the least I can do is live for Him. “If Jesus Christ be God and died for me,” said the great British athlete C. T. Studd, “then no sacrifice can be too great for me to make for him.” Isaac Watts’ great hymn says the same thing: “Love so amazing, so divine, demands my heart, my life, my all.”  That it is to be a sacrifice intimates that it is to be realized as the outcome of the sacrifice of Christ on the cross. That it is to be living sets it in contrast with animal sacrifices, whether those appointed by God for the Jews, or those offered in idolatrous worship by Gentiles. Secondly, it suggests that the sacrifice is to be constant.</p>
<p>The term “reasonable service” should more accurately be translated “spiritual worship.” As believer-priests, we do not come to God with the bodies of slain animals but with the spiritual sacrifice of yielded lives.  Worship that does not include the WHOLE BODY (Person) or that is done against our will is NOT worship.  We also offer to Him our service (Rom. 15:16), our praise (Heb. 13:15), and our possessions (Heb. 13:16).   The word service (Gr latreia) is a term used for the function of priests in the tabernacle. The adjective (Gr logikos) which precedes it may be translated either reasonable (i.e., rational) or spiritual. But our worshipful service can only be spiritual in the biblical sense when it is characterized by our conscious, intelligent, rational service to the Lord God. In Paul’s theology, spirituality is not some mindless flittering of the heart but is the presentation of an entire life to the Lord.</p>
<p>Not only is the presentation of our bodies the subject of Paul’s request, it is the pattern of our behavior as well. And be not conformed to this world. Paul cautions the believer not to be fashioned after this world or age (Gr aiōn). The world system of this age is an evil one (Gal 1:4), and is dominated by “the god of this world” (II Cor 4:4). The new creation in Christ is to live with the understanding that “old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new” (II Cor 5:17). We are therefore not to have our lives governed by the thought patterns and dictates of this evil world system.</p>
<p>Secondly, Paul urges us not to be conformed to this world, or as Phillips paraphrases it: “Don’t let the world around you squeeze you into its own mold.” When we come to the kingdom of God, we should abandon the thought-patterns and lifestyles of the world.  The world (literally age) as used here means the society or system that man has built in order to make himself happy without God. It is a kingdom that is antagonistic to God. The god and prince of this world is Satan (2 Cor. 4:4; John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11. All unconverted people are his subjects. He seeks to attract and hold people through the lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life (1 Jn. 2:16). The world has its own politics, art, music, religion, amusements, thought-patterns, and lifestyles, and it seeks to get everyone to conform to its culture and customs. It hates nonconformists—like Christ and His followers.   Christ died to deliver us from this world. The world is crucified to us, and we are crucified to the world.  It would be absolute disloyalty to the Lord for believers to love the world.  Believers are not of the world any more than Christ is of the world. However, they are sent into the world to testify that its works are evil and that salvation is available to all who put their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>“but be ye transformed” — The word metamorphoomai is rendered “transfigured” in Matthew 17:2; Mark 9:2, and “transformed” in 2 Corinthians 3:18. While the word schēma (see the verb in the preceding clause) stresses what is outward, the word morphē lays stress upon that which is essential and inward, and which finds expression in outward manifestation. Both words represent what is real and not merely apparent, the difference being in the prominence given to what is outward and inward respectively.  “by the renewing of your mind,” — This renewal of the mind means the adjustment of our moral and spiritual vision to the mind of God. It is designed to have a transforming effect upon the whole life.<br />
But how can we prevent that? Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. The only possible way for the believer not to be fashioned (Gr syschēmatizō) after this world is to be transformed in mind. The word transformed (Gr metamorphoō) reaches far deeper than conformity to the world. This implies a fundamental change in the Christian’s inward nature and a following pattern of character which corresponds to that new nature. Thus the mind (Gr nous, the center of logical reasoning, ethical judgment, and moral awareness) must be completely changed if we are to live a life that is holy and acceptable unto God.</p>
<p>We should not only be separated from the world; we should be transformed by the renewing of our mind, which means that we should think the way God thinks, as revealed in the Bible.  Our very thought processes should be made new so that we no longer think like the world; our priorities, our values, our methods, and our attitudes are all DIFFERENT.  Then we can experience the direct guidance of God in our lives.  And we will find that, instead of being distasteful and hard, His will is good and acceptable and perfect.</p>
<p>We now can define what we are talking about in this series of lessons.  The subject is discipleship; the goal is transformation in the life of the Christian; and the method is the “making new” of our minds so that we think like God thinks, and no longer like the world thinks.<br />
Part 1:  The Mind – The root of the matter</p>
<p><strong>MIND</strong> — the part of a person that thinks and reasons. Although the Hebrew language had no word for mind, several Hebrew words are sometimes translated as “mind.” The word for HEART frequently means “mind” (Deut. 30:1; Jer. 19:5). The word for SOUL is sometimes used similarly (1 Chr. 28:9), as is the word for SPIRIT (Ezek. 11:5).</p>
<p>Four separate Greek words account for nearly all instances of “mind” in the New Testament. They all mean much the same thing: understanding, thought, mind, reason. While today we think of a person’s mind in a morally neutral way, in the New Testament the mind was clearly thought of as either good or evil. Negatively, the mind may be “hardened” (2 Cor. 3:14), “blinded” (2 Cor. 4:4), “corrupt” (2 Tim. 3:8), and “debased” (Rom. 1:28). On the positive side, humans may have minds that are renewed (Rom. 12:2) and pure (2 Pet. 3:1). They may love God with all their minds (Matt. 22:37; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27) and have God’s laws implanted in their minds (Heb. 8:10). Since Christians have “the mind of Christ” (1 Cor. 2:16), they are instructed to be united in mind (Rom. 12:16; 1 Pet. 3:8).</p>
<p>The mind of man is the battleground where the battles of discipleship are won or lost.  Our attitudes, priorities, plans, and actions all flow from the mind; this is why the mind of man must be RENEWED (made new) when we are saved, so that everything that flows from our mind will become more and more in tune with God’s Word, Will, and Way.</p>
<p>The first part of getting our mind renewed is to understand that we need to UNLEARN what we thought we knew that is WRONG.  As any teacher can tell you, teaching someone who comes into your class with NO knowledge of the subject is a lot easier that trying to teach someone who THINKS they know the subject, but have bad information.</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 14:1  “The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 14:16  “A wise man fears and departs from evil, But a fool rages and is self-confident.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Romans 1:18-23</strong>  “For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them.  For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened.  Professing to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man—and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.”</p>
<p><strong>Proverbs 16:25</strong>  “There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death.”<br />
When we acknowledge that what we have thought in regards to God, sin, life, eternity, “goodness”, and so on are WRONG, then we are “teachable”, and are ready to move on to having our mind renewed.</p>
<h4>Lesson 2:  The Importance &amp; Power Of The Word Of God</h4>
<p><strong>Romans 12:1-2</strong>   “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</p>
<p>As Christians, we should not only be separated from the world; we should be transformed by the renewing of our mind, which means that we should think the way God thinks, as revealed in the Bible.  Our very thought processes should be made new so that we no longer think like the world; our priorities, our values, our methods, and our attitudes are all DIFFERENT.  Then we can experience the direct guidance of God in our lives.  And we will find that, instead of being distasteful and hard, His will is good and acceptable and perfect.  The subject of the above verses is discipleship; the goal is transformation in the life of the Christian; and the method is the “making new” of our minds so that we think like God thinks, and no longer like the world thinks.</p>
<p><strong>The Word:<br />
2nd Timothy 3:16-17<br />
</strong>16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
<p><strong>John 14:23-24<br />
</strong>23 Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him. 24 He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine but the Father’s who sent Me.</p>
<p><strong>Ephesians 5:25-27<br />
</strong>25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her, 26 that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word, 27 that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.</p>
<p><strong>Ephesians 6:13-17<br />
</strong>13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.  14 Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. 17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;</p>
<p><strong>Colossians 3:16<br />
</strong>16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>Hebrews 4:12<br />
</strong>12 For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
<p><strong>Hebrews 5:12-14<br />
</strong>12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. 13 For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. 14 But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p>
<p><strong>1 Peter 2:1-3</strong><br />
1 Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, 2 as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, 3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.<br />
The Regenerating Power of God’s Word (1 Pet. 1:23). Just as we owe our natural existence to the Creator’s spoken word and life-giving breath, so we owe our New Birth to the power of God’s Word and the Holy Spirit’s activation of its power. God’s intent for our created being is only completely fulfilled when our spirits are alive toward Him. As sin has produced spiritual death in people (Eph. 2:1-3), so salvation in Jesus Christ has provided spiritual life. This text tells us that the “seed” that has produced new life in us is the Word of God, which has begotten us again by the Holy Spirit’s power (Titus 3:5) and made us members of God’s new creation (2 Cor. 5:17). The power of God’s Word—the Holy Scriptures—is in no way more manifest than in this: its power to bring spiritual life to all who open to its truth. James 1:18 elaborates the fact that God’s “word of truth” is the means by which He brought us new life, emphasizing that He has done this as a direction of His own will. God’s will to save us (2 Pet. 3:9) has been effectively expressed in His Word, which accomplishes that work (John 1:13).</p>
<p>The Authority of God’s Word over Our Lives (Ps. 119:89-91). This text asserts the all-encompassing, absolutely authoritative Word of God as unchangingly secured in heaven, noting: (1) The timelessness of God’s rule by His Word. Though times and seasons change, though social customs, human opinions, and philosophical viewpoints vary, they have no effect on the constancy or authority of God’s Word. (2) God is faithful in applying the power, promise, and blessing of His Word, along with its requirements of justice and judgment (v. 90). Just as He spoke and the earth was created and is sustained, so He has spoken regarding His laws for living. The relativism of human thought does not affect His authority or standards. (3) While creation abides by His Word (responding as His “servants,” v. 90), man is often a study in contrast to this submission to the Creator’s authority. Whatever our past rebellion, however, upon coming to Christ a practical reinstatement of God’s Word as the governing principle for all our life is to take place. Not only does Jesus conclusively declare this (John 8:47), but Paul notes that to respond otherwise is to compromise the level of life to which we have been called (1 Cor. 2:13-16). As “spiritual” people we are to refuse the “natural” inclinations of fallen humanity. As we hear and yield to the authority of God’s Word, we verify that we are no longer dominated by the world’s spirit of error (1 John 4:6).</p>
<p>God’s Word and Our Soul’s Nourishment (Deut. 8:3). Jesus quoted this text in Matthew 4:4, when He faced Satan’s snares in the wilderness. The obvious message of the passage is that there is no survival of the soul without God’s Word—daily. That the parallel is used of Israel’s receiving the daily supply of manna makes clear that a regular, daily portion of God’s Word is to be sought and fed upon by the believer.</p>
<p>This is not a matter of legal duty, determining one’s salvation, but a matter of personal responsibility, determining one’s obedience to the pathway of discipleship. Let no one suppose, however, that spiritual survival is possible for long without nourishment from the Word of God. First Peter 2:2 declares that God’s Word is as essential to the believer as milk is to a newborn child. But as we come to terms with His Word as key to our survival, let us also see that God has given its pleasantness as a joyful source of sweetness for our living (Ps. 19:10).</p>
<p>God’s Word and Practical, Fruitful Living (Ps. 119:105). We are all inexperienced in too much of life to be without a guide. God’s Word is that guide. The whole of Psalm 119 unfolds manifold features of God’s Word, showing how dynamically it will assist us in life’s most practical circumstances. No single verse focuses this more clearly than verse 105, which shows how God’s Word lights the way, giving direction for each step (“to my feet”) and giving wisdom for long-range plans (“to my path”). Joshua links the regular application of God’s Word to life as the most certain way to both success and prosperity in living (Josh. 1:8).</p>
<p>Further, Psalm 119:130 notes the wisdom God’s Word gives to the “simple”, a truth specifically pointing toward the avoidance of making decisions based on human delusion or outright senselessness. Also, Proverbs 6:23 reminds us that the “reproofs” or corrections the Bible gives are as much a part of the “light” it provides as any positive or confirming direction we find therein. Let God’s Word guide, correct, instruct, lead, teach, and confirm. Do not hasten ahead without it—ever.</p>
<p>True Spiritual Growth Requires God’s Word (1 Cor. 3:1-5). Beginning in 1 Corinthians 2:10, Paul elaborates our need of Holy Spirit-given wisdom and revelation, and he ties this very firmly to our receiving the “words…which the Holy Spirit teaches” (2:13). He immediately turns from these observations to an outright confrontation with the carnality of the Corinthians, attributing it to the shallowness of their intake of God’s Word (“not able to receive [solid food],” 3:2; see also Heb. 5:12-14).</p>
<p>The demanding truth of this passage is that no amount of supposed spiritual insight or experience reflects genuine spiritual growth, if it is separated from our basic growth in the knowledge of God’s Word in the Bible. Without this rootedness in the Word, we may be deluded about our growth. Such “rootedness” is in truth and love, not merely in learning knowledge or accomplished study. In order to experience true spiritual growth, we must spend time in the Word and separate ourselves from the hindrances of lovelessness, competitiveness, and strife.</p>
<p>Loving God’s Word as Jesus’ Follower (John 14:21). Jesus completely aligned His life and will with the Father’s (8:29), which indicates His total allegiance to the Father’s Word and commandments. He also said He disapproved of any attitude that would reduce respect for or teach less than full obedience to the entirety of God’s revealed Word (Matt. 5:17-19). Thus, in this text, when He explicitly links His disciples’ love for Him as Savior with their will to keep His commandments, we conclude Jesus’ clear intent: If we love Him, we will love His Father’s Word, also.<br />
In John 5:39 our Lord declares that the knowledge of the Scriptures is the pathway to knowing Him well. Further, upon His resurrection, He unveiled the fullness of His own Person as revealed in the Old Testament (Luke 24:27). These texts cluster to teach us that to follow Christ, to know Him, and to grow in insight as people walking with the Resurrected Lord, a basic and continuing requirement is a steadfast commitment to hearing, heeding, and studying the Bible.</p>
<p>God’s Word: Purifier unto Holy Living (James 1:23-25). Purity of life is not a quest for perfection as much as it is a quest for liberation from those things that may inhibit effectiveness and reduce power-filled living. This text shows the Word of God as a means of reflection—a mirror into which we are to look and see ourselves. The call is not only to heed what we see and accept the Bible’s corrective instruction, but there is an unwritten lesson here. We should avoid the temptation to see (and judge) others in the Word, analyzing what they ought to do, instead of what we need to do. Second Corinthians 3:18 also likens God’s Word to a mirror, but describes the image seen as no less than the Lord Jesus Himself. The sum of the two texts: The Bible shows us Christ’s likeness in order that we may measure our conduct and character against His and allow God to shape us into Christ’s likeness (Rom. 8:29). Other promises for cleansing through God’s Word: Jeremiah 29:9 speaks of the “fire” in the Word, which can purge as well as ignite; and Psalm 119:9 holds special promise to the one who wants a pure life of holy power. God’s Word is a powerful, cleansing, delivering agent.</p>
<p>God’s Word: Read It! Study It! Memorize It! (2 Tim. 2:15). The Bible—God’s inspired Word—is the only conclusive source of wisdom, knowledge, and understanding concerning ultimate realities. It is a fountainhead of freeing truth (John 8:32) and a goldmine of practical principles (Ps. 19:10), waiting to liberate and/or enrich the person who will pursue its truth and wealth. Thus, Paul’s instruction to “be diligent…a worker” has been applied by serious Christians through the centuries as a directive to study the Word of God. The only way to healthy, balanced living is through the “rightly dividing” (Greek orthotomounta, literally, “cutting straight”) of God’s Word. Such correct, straight-on application of God’s Word is the result of diligent study. The text calls us beyond casual approaches to the Scriptures, telling us to refuse to suit the Bible to our own convenience or ideology.</p>
<p>In his earlier words (1 Tim. 4:13) Paul also told Timothy, “Give attention to reading [God’s Word],” but now he emphasizes studying like a “worker” (from Greek ergon—“toil, effort”). Psalm 119:11 urges memorizing of the Word of God as a mighty deterrent against sin. Memorizing the Scripture also provides an immediate availability of God’s “words” as a sword, ready in witnessing and effective in spiritual warfare (Heb. 4:12; Eph. 6:17).</p>
<p><strong>The following is a positive, biblical statement for today’s believer.</strong></p>
<p>I Believe the Bible. I believe in the Holy Scriptures, the Bible, the eternal Word of God. I believe in its divine inspiration, its infallible authority, and its completeness in form and content.</p>
<p>Because I believe this, I treasure this Book, for therein is the written will of God revealed by the Holy Spirit. I will appeal to this ultimate Word from heaven as the conclusive guide for every issue of life, knowing that the Living God who has authored it supports its every word and subscribes its every promise. I reject all attempts of flesh or spirit to add to this written revelation, believing that herein is all I need to understand and to communicate the whole of God’s creative and redemptive purposes for man.</p>
<p>(Supporting texts: 1 Kin. 8:54-58; Pss. 19:7-11; 119:1-16, 89; Jer. 1:12; Matt. 24:35; Gal. 1:6-9; 2 Tim. 3:16-17; Rev. 22:18-19.)</p>
<p>I believe in the Bible, given by the Holy Spirit through human agency overseen by the mind of the Eternal Father, and thereby established and sustained in its unity of purpose and message which is the testimony of the Son of God, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Because I believe this, I depend upon the Holy Spirit to illumine my understanding in the Word of God. I affirm my commitment to hear this Word with my heart as well as my mind, realizing that unless a spiritual, as well as an intellectual response is made, the full intent of the entrance of God’s Word is not being gained. In my open quest to receive all the Word contains and intends in spirit and life, I reject any approach to the Scriptures which seek them for other than the revelation of Christ in the Word and the practical unfolding of God’s way of life for us in Him.</p>
<p>(Supporting Scriptures: Luke 24:25-27; John 5:37-38; 6:63; 16:13-14; 1 Cor. 2:12-14; Col. 2:8-23; 1 Tim. 4:15-16; 6:20-21; 2 Tim. 2:15-16, 23; 1 Pet. 1:10-12; 2 Pet. 1:19-21; Rev. 19:10.)</p>
<p>I believe in the Word of God, the source of faith. I believe it is to be preached and taught to every man and that through its words the human spirit may be reborn, instructed in righteousness, and brought to maturity in life and love for God and man.</p>
<p>Because I believe this, I receive the Word with both a commitment and a commission. I commit myself to hear the Word with expectation, available as its truth calls forth repentance and transformation in my life, and believing as its promises summon me to a lifetime pathway of practical faith in God. And I acknowledge my responsibility to all mankind, to communicate the Word of God through my witness, my service, and my resource.</p>

<h4>Lesson 3:  The Importance &amp; Power Of The Holy Spirit</h4>
<p><strong>Romans 12:1-2</strong>   “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</p>
<p>As Christians, we should not only be separated from the world; we should be transformed by the renewing of our mind, which means that we should think the way God thinks, as revealed in the Bible.  Our very thought processes should be made new so that we no longer think like the world; our priorities, our values, our methods, and our attitudes are all DIFFERENT.  Then we can experience the direct guidance of God in our lives.  And we will find that, instead of being distasteful and hard, His will is good and acceptable and perfect.  The subject of the above verses is discipleship; the goal is transformation in the life of the Christian; and the method is the “making new” of our minds so that we think like God thinks, and no longer like the world thinks.</p>
<p><strong>The Spirit:</strong></p>
<p><strong>John 14:16-17<br />
</strong>16 And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever— 17 the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you.</p>
<p><strong>John 14:26</strong><br />
26 But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.</p>
<p><strong>John 16:13-14<br />
</strong>13 However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. 14 He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you.</p>
<p><strong>Acts 11:11-12<br />
</strong>11 At that very moment, three men stood before the house where I was, having been sent to me from Caesarea. 12 Then the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 5:5<br />
</strong>5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit  who was given to us.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 8:14<br />
</strong>14 For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 8:26<br />
</strong>26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</p>
<p><strong>1st Corinthians 2:7-14<br />
</strong>7 But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the ages for our glory, 8 which none of the rulers of this age knew; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.<br />
9 But as it is written:  “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” 10 But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. 11 For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. 12 Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God.  13 These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 14 But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</p>
<p><strong>1st Corinthians 12:1-13<br />
</strong>1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I do not want you to be ignorant: 2 You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, however you were led. 3 Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.  4 There are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit. 5 There are differences of ministries, but the same Lord. 6 And there are diversities of activities, but it is the same God who works all in all. 7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one for the profit of all: 8 for to one is given the word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another the word of knowledge through the same Spirit, 9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit, 10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another discerning of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. 11 But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills.  12 For as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ. 13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body— whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free—and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Galatians 3:2-3<br />
</strong>2 This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?— 3 Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?</p>
<p><strong>Galatians 5:16-25<br />
</strong>16 I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. 17 For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. 18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.  19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, 20 idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, 21 envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.  22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. 24 And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. 25 If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Ephesians 3:14-19<br />
</strong>14 For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 15 from whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, 16 that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man, 17 that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the width and length and depth and height— 19 to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>
<p><strong>1 John 4:1-3<br />
</strong>1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, 3 and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit appears in the Gospel of John as the power by which Christians are brought to faith and helped to understand their walk with God. He brings a person to new birth: “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” (John 3:6); “It is the Spirit who gives life” (John 6:63). The Holy Spirit is the Paraclete, or Helper, whom Jesus promised to the disciples after His ascension. The Trinity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are unified in ministering to believers (John 14:16, 26). It is through the Helper that Father and Son abide with the disciples (John 15:26).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is active in Christian baptism, worship, proclamation, and instruction, and in moral discernment. He enables Christians to lead a life of purity and holiness. He endows Christians for various ministries and gifts. He gives gifts as he wills (1 Cor. 12:11), he leads believers and bears witness in them (Rom. 8:14, 16).</p>
<p>It was by the Spirit of God that the apostles and prophets were enlightened, because the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. In other words, the Spirit of God, one of the members of the Godhead, is infinite in wisdom and understands all the truths of God and is able to impart them to others.  Even in human affairs no one knows what a man is thinking but he himself. No one else can possibly find out unless the man himself chooses to make it known. Even then, in order to understand a man, a person must have the spirit of a man. An animal could not fully understand our thinking. So it is with God. The only one who can understand the things of God is the Spirit of God.  Unaided, the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God. They are foolishness to him. He cannot possibly understand them because they can only be spiritually understood.  On the other hand, the man who is illuminated by the Spirit of God can discern these wonderful truths even though he himself cannot be rightly judged by the unconverted. Perhaps he is a carpenter, or plumber, or fisherman; yet he is an able student of the Holy Scriptures. “The Spirit-controlled Christian investigates, inquires into, and scrutinizes the Bible and comes to an appreciation and understanding of its contents”. To the world he is an enigma. He may never have been to college or seminary, yet he can understand the deep mysteries of the word of God and perhaps even teach them to others.</p>
<p>To walk in (or by) the Spirit is to allow Him to have His way. It is to remain in communion with Him. It is to make decisions in the light of His holiness. It is to be occupied with Christ, because the Spirit’s ministry is to engage the believer with the Lord Jesus. When we thus walk in the Spirit, the flesh, or self-life, is treated as dead. We cannot be occupied at the same time with Christ and with sin.</p>
<p>In dealing with the “fruit of the Spirit”, it is significant that the apostle distinguishes between the works of the flesh, and the fruit of the Spirit. Works are produced by human energy. Fruit is grown as a branch abides in the vine (John 15:5). They differ as a factory and a garden differ. Note that fruit is singular, not plural. The Holy Spirit produces one kind of fruit, that is, Christlikeness.</p>
<p>The blessing that we seek through the Spirit is spiritual power. Not the power to perform spectacular miracles, but the spiritual vigor needed to be mature, stable, intelligent Christians. The One who imparts this power is the Holy Spirit. Of course, He will give us strength only in measure as we feed on the Word of God, as we breathe the pure air of prayer, and as we get exercise in daily service for the Lord.  This power is experienced in the inner man, that is, the spiritual part of our nature. It is the inner man that delights in the law of God (Rom. 7:22). It is the inner man that is renewed day by day, even though the outward man is perishing (2 Cor. 4:16). Though it is of God, our inner man needs strength, growth, and development.</p>
<p>In 1st John chapter 4, having mentioned the Holy Spirit, John is reminded that there are other spirits abroad in the world today, and that the children of God need to be warned against them. Thus he cautions the believer not to trust every spirit.</p>
<p>In contrast to the works (plural) of the flesh, which any individual is capable of performing, the fruit (singular) of the Holy Spirit can be produced only by God. Christian character thus results from “Christ living in me”.  Today, Christians should allow the Holy Spirit to develop this character within them, so they might be blameless before others and not hinder the testimony of Christ.</p>
<h4>Lesson 4:  The Importance &amp; Power Of The Body Of Christ (The Church)</h4>
<p>Romans 12:1-2   “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</p>
<p>As Christians, we should not only be separated from the world; we should be transformed by the renewing of our mind, which means that we should think the way God thinks, as revealed in the Bible.  Our very thought processes should be made new so that we no longer think like the world; our priorities, our values, our methods, and our attitudes are all DIFFERENT.  Then we can experience the direct guidance of God in our lives.  And we will find that, instead of being distasteful and hard, His will is good and acceptable and perfect.  The subject of the above verses is discipleship; the goal is transformation in the life of the Christian; and the method is the “making new” of our minds so that we think like God thinks, and no longer like the world thinks.</p>
<p><strong>The Church:</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHURCH</strong> — a local assembly of believers as well as the redeemed of all the ages who follow Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.  In the four gospels of the New Testament, the term “church” is found only in Matthew 16:18 and 18:17. This scarcity of usage in those books that report on the life and ministry of Jesus is perhaps best explained by the fact that the church as the body of Christ did not begin until the day of PENTECOST after the ASCENSION of Jesus (Acts 2:1–4).  That the church began on the day of Pentecost may be demonstrated in various ways: (1) Christ Himself declared the church to be yet future (Matt. 16:18); (2) it was founded upon the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ, and such an accomplished fact was not possible until Pentecost (Eph. 1:15–23); (3) there could be no church until it was fully purchased with Christ’s blood (Eph. 2:13).</p>
<p>Nature. The Greek word for church is ekklesia. This word is used 115 times in the New Testament, mostly in the Book of Acts and the writings of the apostle Paul and the general epistles. At least 92 times this word refers to a local congregation. The other references are to the church general, or all believers everywhere for all ages.  When the church general is implied, “church” refers to all who follow Christ, without respect to locality or time. The most general reference to the church occurs in Ephesians 1:22; 3:10–21; 5:23–32.<br />
Because the church general will not become a tangible reality until after Christ’s return, the greatest emphasis in the New Testament is placed upon the idea of the local church. The local church is the visible operation of the church general in a given time and place.</p>
<p>Commission. Speaking to His followers after His resurrection, Jesus commissioned the church to make disciples and teach them what He had taught (Matt. 28:16–20). The entire Book of Acts is the story of the early church’s struggle to be loyal to this commission. As we read this book, we are impressed by the reality that Christ, through the presence of the Holy Spirit, continues to direct His church as it carries out its commission.</p>
<p>Romans 12:3-18  <br />
3 For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. 4 For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, 5 so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. 6 Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith; 7 or ministry, let us use it in our ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; 8 he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.<br />
9 Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. 10 Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honor giving preference to one another; 11 not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; 12 rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer; 13 distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality.<br />
14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. 15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. 16 Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion.<br />
17 Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men. 18 If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:24-25<br />
24 And let us consider one another in order to stir up love and good works, 25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the Day approaching.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-16<br />
11 And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, 12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 14 that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 15 but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ— 16 from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.</p>
<p>Repeatedly in Revelation chapters 2-3<br />
“He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” ’<br />
Why Attend Church?<br />
David declared that he was glad to “go into the house of the LORD” for worship (Ps. 122:1). Today, many Christians are glad to go into their church buildings to worship Christ, but a growing number are not. In fact, unprecedented numbers have become dropouts from church attendance.<br />
Their reasons for quitting vary. But in light of David’s joy in coming before the Lord, it might help to consider reasons for maintaining church attendance:<br />
•     Because believers need help to reflect on the past week and see it as just a small part of the journey of life.<br />
•     Because they will benefit from being taught and led in worship by others, rather than feeding on a constant diet of their own choosing.<br />
•     Because they need regular reminders of their standing in Christ, help in acknowledging and confessing their sins, and teaching about God’s truths.<br />
•     Because they need to hear how believers in the past struggled, grew, and lived out their faith.<br />
•     Because they need to experience artistic and creative expressions of the faith, such as music, prayers, or creeds.<br />
•     Because they will benefit from silence before the Lord once in a while.<br />
•     Because they need help to face the issues of life and faith as presented through the teaching.<br />
•     Because they need to hear about the experience of other believers.<br />
•     Because they need an alternative to the constant messages of a culture that ignores God.<br />
•     Because they need a conscious break from work and self-interests in order to concentrate on the Lord.<br />
•     Because they need to hear reminders of God’s love.<br />
•     Because they need help in praying.<br />
•     Because they need to belong to a community of faith that includes others who are trying to live out the gospel.</p>
<h4>Lesson 5:  The Importance &amp; Power Of Prayer</h4>
<p><strong>Romans 12:1-2</strong>   “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</p>
<p>As Christians, we should not only be separated from the world; we should be transformed by the renewing of our mind, which means that we should think the way God thinks, as revealed in the Bible.  Our very thought processes should be made new so that we no longer think like the world; our priorities, our values, our methods, and our attitudes are all DIFFERENT.  Then we can experience the direct guidance of God in our lives.  And we will find that, instead of being distasteful and hard, His will is good and acceptable and perfect.  The subject of the above verses is discipleship; the goal is transformation in the life of the Christian; and the method is the “making new” of our minds so that we think like God thinks, and no longer like the world thinks.</p>
<p><strong>The Importance Of Prayer:<br />
</strong>Both Jesus (Luke 18:1) and Paul (1 Tim. 2:1) emphasized the importance of prayer, noting that people ought always to pray. Prayer includes asking and getting answers from God. But it is more than just asking; it is confession, adoration, thanksgiving, and fellowship with God. By its nature, prayer is talking with God. It is the basis of the successful Christian life, and is so important that not praying is considered a sin (1 Sam. 12:23). When we pray, we should follow the outline of the model prayer Jesus gave His disciples and address it to our heavenly Father—beginning with adoration, including thanksgiving and confession of sins, making reconciliation with others, praying for our needs and the needs of others, and concluding in Jesus’ name (His authority) (6:9–15; John 14:14).  God will answer our prayer when we obey Him (1 John 3:22), confess sin (Ps. 66:18), abide in Christ (John 15:7), ask according to the will of God (1 John 5:14), ask in faith (Mark 11:24), have pure motives (James 4:3), and live peaceably with our mate (1 Pet. 3:7).</p>
<p>Prayer cannot be replaced by devout good works in a needy world. Important as service to others is, at times we must turn away from it to God, who is distinct from all things and over all things. Neither should prayer be thought of as a mystical experience in which people lose their identity in the infinite reality. Effective prayer must be a scripturally informed response of persons saved by grace to the living God who can hear and answer on the basis of Christ’s payment of the penalty that sinners deserved. As such, prayer involves several important aspects.</p>
<p><strong>Faith.</strong> The most meaningful prayer comes from a heart that places its trust in the God who has acted and spoken in the Jesus of history and the teachings of the Bible. God speaks to us through the Bible, and we in turn speak to Him in trustful, believing prayer. Assured by Scripture that God is personal, living, active, all-knowing, all-wise, and all-powerful, we know that God can hear and help us. A confident prayer life is built on the cornerstone of Christ’s work and words as shown by the prophets and apostles in the Bible.</p>
<p>Worship. In worship we recognize what is of highest worth—not ourselves, others, or our work, but God. Only the highest divine being deserves our highest respect. Guided by Scripture, we set our values in accord with God’s will and perfect standards. Before God, angels hide their faces and cry, “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts” (Is. 6:3).</p>
<p><strong>Confession.</strong> Awareness of God’s holiness leads to consciousness of our own sinfulness. Like the prophet Isaiah, we exclaim, “Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts” (Is. 6:5). By sinning we hurt ourselves and those closest to us; but first of all, and worst of all, sin is against God (Ps. 51:4). We need not confess our sins to another being. But we should confess them directly to God, who promises to forgive us of all our unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p><strong>Adoration.</strong> God is love, and He has demonstrated His love in the gift of His Son. The greatest desire of God is that we love Him with our whole being (Matt. 22:37). Our love should be expressed, as His has been expressed, in both deeds and words. People sometimes find it difficult to say to others and to God, “I love you.” But when love for God fills our lives, we will express our love in prayer to the one who is ultimately responsible for all that we are.</p>
<p><strong>Praise.</strong> The natural outgrowth of faith, worship, confession, and adoration is praise. We speak well of one whom we highly esteem and love. The one whom we respect and love above all others naturally receives our highest commendation. We praise Him for His “mighty acts . . . according to His excellent greatness” (Ps. 150:2), and for His “righteous judgments” (Ps. 119:164). For God Himself, for His works, and for His words, His people give sincere praise.</p>
<p><strong>Thanksgiving. </strong> Are we unthankful because we think we have not received what we deserve? But if we got what we “deserved,” we would be condemned because of our guilt. As sinners, we are not people of God by nature. We have no claim upon His mercy or grace. Nevertheless, He has forgiven our sins, granted us acceptance as His people, and given us His righteous standing and a new heart and life.  Ingratitude marks the ungodly, “because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful” (Rom. 1:21). Believers, in contrast, live thankfully. God has been at work on our behalf in countless ways. So in everything, even for the discipline that is unpleasant, we give thanks (Col. 3:17; 1 Thess. 5:18).</p>
<p><strong>Dedicated Action.</strong> Christ’s example does not require us to withdraw from society, but to render service to the needy in a spirit of prayer. He wept over Jerusalem in compassionate prayer, and then He went into the city to give His life a ransom for many. Authentic prayer will be the source of courage and productivity, as it was for the prophets and apostles.</p>
<p><strong>Request.</strong> Prayer is not only response to God’s grace as brought to us in the life and work of Jesus and the teaching of Scripture; it is also request for our needs and the needs of others.  Prayer is request to a personal Lord who answers as He knows best. We should not think that we will always have success in obtaining the things for which we ask. In His wisdom, God hears and answers in the way that is best.</p>
<p><strong>Effectiveness.</strong> Prayer has power over everything. God can intelligently act in any part of the universe or human history. Although some people think prayer is a waste of time, the Bible declares that “the effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much” (James 5:16).<br />
Prayer meets inner needs. One who prays will receive freedom from fear (Ps. 118:5–6), strength of soul (Ps. 138:3), guidance and satisfaction (Is. 58:9–11), wisdom and understanding (Dan. 9:20–27), deliverance from harm (Joel 2:32), reward (Matt. 6:6), good gifts (Luke 11:13), fullness of joy (John 16:23–24), peace (Phil. 4:6–8), and freedom from anxiety (1 Pet. 5:7).</p>
<p>Is prayer effective only in the inner lives of those who pray? No, prayer can make a difference in the lives of others. Biblical writers believed prayer for others could result in greater wisdom and power (Eph. 1:18–19); inward strength, knowledge of Christ’s love, filling with God’s fullness (Eph. 3:16–19); discernment, approval of what is excellent, filling with the fruits of righteousness (Phil. 1:9–11); knowledge of God’s will, spiritual understanding, a life pleasing to God, fruitfulness, endurance, patience, joy (Col. 1:9–12); a quiet, peaceable life (1 Tim. 2:1–2); love for one another and all people, holiness before God (1 Thess. 3:10–13); comfort and establishment in every good word and work (2 Thess. 2:16–17); love for God, steadfastness in Christ (2 Thess. 3:5); the sharing of one’s faith, promotion of the knowledge of all that is good (Philem. 6); and equipment for every good work that is pleasing to God (Heb. 13:20–21).<br />
Persistence in Prayer</p>
<p>Do you ever feel impatient with God? Does He seem late in answering your requests or meeting your needs?  Jesus spoke to the issues of how to pray, how long to pray, and how long God might take to respond. One day His disciples asked Him to teach them to pray (Luke 11:1). He told a story about someone with a need who was very persistent in asking a neighbor for help (Luke 11:5–8).  The story makes it clear that our ability to ask does not equal God’s response or its timing. God is not a celestial bellhop waiting at our beck and call. Neither does He rely on us to define our needs, outline solutions, or say when or how He should act. No, God does those for us—which is just as well since He is all-wise.  God delights in His children developing the habit and freedom of asking Him for help (Luke 11:9–10). But He won’t leave us trapped in our limited perception of the situation (Luke 11:11–13). Sooner or later He will answer our prayers, but in His own time. He asks us to trust Him to know what is needed and when.  Our calling, then, is to ask—even persistently—and to grow in the process. One of the surprising benefits of praying is how much we change. Sometimes, that in itself is the answer to our prayers.</p>
<p><strong>PRAYER AND SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT.</strong> The night before His crucifixion, Jesus underscored the privileged pathway of prayer now being opened to His own through His Cross: “Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full” (John 15:24). By His own emphasis, Jesus placed prayer at the heart of Christian living. When the pulse is steady and the body exercised in this practice, every other facet of life flows with health as the individual is fed by God’s Word. Yet prayer is a puzzle to some who think it too mystical and a problem for others who find the habit hard to establish.</p>
<p>Immature faith tries to manipulate God. It looks for spiritual shortcuts and formulas guaranteed to produce an answer to any request. It regards prayer as a weapon we use to force God to make good His promises. But true prayer is not a human effort at persuading God or forcing our will on Him. True prayer is founded upon finding and coming into agreement with God’s will. We ask according to His will; then we stand in faith, confident that God hears us and that what we ask for is already ours.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons:</strong> (1) To pray with authority and receive answers to your prayers, make sure you ask according to the will of God. If you do not know His will, ask Him (James 1:5). (2) Believe that God hears your petition and has already set the answer into motion. (3) Pray tenaciously and persistently until His will is accomplished. That is true prayer.<br />
Strange, Powerful Principle of Prayer<br />
When Daniel read in the Book of Jeremiah that God was going to keep His people in captivity for seventy years and then release them, he believed it. Then a very strange thing happened. He began to pray that God would do what He was going to do. Wait a minute, if God’s going to do it, why should we pray? At this point we discover one of the most tremendous principles about prayer.<br />
God knows His plan, and even when He reveals His plan to us, He expects us to pray over that plan. The Bible says, “If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. And if we know that he hears us—whatever we ask—we know that we have what we asked of him” (1 John 5:14–15).</p>
<p>Sometimes I get the impression that I have misunderstood the meaning of prayer. Prayer is not to get God to change His will. If we really believe that the will of God is perfect, then why would we want Him to change it? Our prayers really ought to be prompted out of our deep understanding of what the will of God is. There are a lot of folks who go to prayer, not to ascertain the will of God, but to ask Him to do what they want. Prayer is not getting God to adjust His program to what we want, it is adjusting our lives to the revealed will of God. When we pray, it isn’t God who changes, it’s us. Maybe we’ve been looking for change at the wrong end of the cycle.</p>
<p>Daniel understood God’s will, and he began to pray that his people would come into conformity with the revealed will of God, so that God could do what He had already said He was going to do. The biggest waste of time in Christendom is praying about things that God already said we shouldn’t do. During my years in the ministry many young people have come to me about getting married. For instance, a young girl who is a sweet Christian comes to me when she is ready to get married and wants me to perform the ceremony. She’s madly in love with a fellow who doesn’t know the Lord. We sit down and I open the Bible and talk to her about being unequally yoked together, and that God said this was against His will. “Oh, Pastor, I’ve prayed about this, and I have real peace in my heart.”<br />
I tell her, “I don’t know what you’ve got in your heart, but it isn’t peace from God. It’s probably infatuation, but it is outside the revealed will of God.”</p>
<p>It is never right to pray about that which God has already said is wrong. We might as well save our energy, because it isn’t going to do any good. God doesn’t change His mind. As far as I know, He hasn’t written another Bible.<br />
Prayer is not only motivated by the Word of God and measured by His will, but it is also manifested in our walk with God. Daniel not only prayed frequently, he also prayed fervently. He was committed to daily prayer; in fact, he prayed on his knees three times a day, whether he was busy with the affairs of state or whether the king issued a decree forbidding prayer to anyone except himself.</p>
<h4>Lesson 6:  The Unpleasant Lessons Of Tribulation &amp; Suffering</h4>
<p><strong>Romans 12:1-2</strong>   “I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.  And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</p>
<p>As Christians, we should not only be separated from the world; we should be transformed by the renewing of our mind, which means that we should think the way God thinks, as revealed in the Bible.  Our very thought processes should be made new so that we no longer think like the world; our priorities, our values, our methods, and our attitudes are all DIFFERENT.  Then we can experience the direct guidance of God in our lives.  And we will find that, instead of being distasteful and hard, His will is good and acceptable and perfect.  The subject of the above verses is discipleship; the goal is transformation in the life of the Christian; and the method is the “making new” of our minds so that we think like God thinks, and no longer like the world thinks.</p>
<p><strong>The Lessons That No One Wants To Learn:</strong><br />
TRIBULATION. (John 16:33) thlipsis (thlip-sis); Strong’s #2347: Pressure, oppression, stress, anguish, tribulation, adversity, affliction, crushing, squashing, squeezing, distress. Imagine placing your hand on a stack of loose items and manually compressing them. That is thlipsis, putting a lot of pressure on that which is free and unfettered. Thlipsis is like spiritual bench-pressing. The word is used of crushing grapes or olives in a press.</p>
<p><strong>SUFFERING </strong>— agony, affliction, or distress; intense pain or sorrow. Suffering has been part of the human experience since people fell into sin (Genesis 3). The Psalms, one-third of which are laments, include graphic descriptions of suffering (Psalm 22). A theme of the Book of Job is the problem of suffering and why God permits the righteous to suffer.</p>
<p>The Bible makes it clear that some suffering is the result of evil action or sin in the world. This type of suffering came upon people after the FALL in the Garden of Eden (Gen. 3:16–19). But some suffering is not related to the past. It is forward-looking in that it serves to shape and refine God’s children (1 Pet. 1:6–7; 5:10). The Book of Hebrews declares that Jesus learned obedience by the things He suffered (Heb. 5:8), and that He was perfected through suffering (Heb. 2:10). Suffering has the potential of demonstrating God’s power (2 Cor. 12:7). Those who suffer are in a position to comfort others (2 Cor. 1:3–6).</p>
<p>Suffering also helps believers to identify with Christ, which is more than suffering for Christ. Through persecution and tortures, people have suffered for the sake of Christ and His kingdom (Phil. 1:29; 2 Thess. 1:5; 2 Tim. 3:12). To suffer with Christ, however, is another matter. Paul speaks of the “fellowship of His [Christ’s] sufferings” (Phil. 3:10). Believers share in the suffering of Christ in the sense that through suffering they identify with Christ. To be a disciple involves suffering like the Master. Christ as Lord and His believers as disciples are bonded even further through the experience of suffering.</p>
<p><strong>John 16:33<br />
</strong>33 These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”</p>
<p><strong>Acts 14:21-22<br />
</strong>21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, 22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, “We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.”</p>
<p><strong>Romans 5:1-5<br />
</strong>1 Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2 through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God. 3 And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; 4 and perseverance, character; and character, hope. 5 Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Corinthians 1:3-11<br />
</strong>3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. 5 For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ. 6 Now if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer. Or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. 7 And our hope for you is steadfast, because we know that as you are partakers of the sufferings, so also you will partake of the consolation.  8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life. 9 Yes, we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead, 10 who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver us; in whom we trust that He will still deliver us, 11 you also helping together in prayer for us, that thanks may be given by many persons on our behalf for the gift granted to us through many.</p>
<p><strong>1st Thessalonians 3:1-8<br />
</strong>1 Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we thought it good to be left in Athens alone, 2 and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith, 3 that no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this. 4 For, in fact, we told you before when we were with you that we would suffer tribulation, just as it happened, and you know. 5 For this reason, when I could no longer endure it, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter had tempted you, and our labor might be in vain.<br />
6 But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always have good remembrance of us, greatly desiring to see us, as we also to see you— 7 therefore, brethren, in all our affliction and distress we were comforted concerning you by your faith. 8 For now we live, if you stand fast in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>Revelation 1:9</strong><br />
9 I, John, both your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was on the island that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>Romans 8:16-18<br />
</strong>16 The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, 17 and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together.  18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</p>
<p><strong>Philippians 1:27-30<br />
</strong>27 Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel, 28 and not in any way terrified by your adversaries, which is to them a proof of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God. 29 For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake, 30 having the same conflict which you saw in me and now hear is in me.</p>
<p><strong>2nd Timothy 3:10-12<br />
</strong>10 But you have carefully followed my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, perseverance, 11 persecutions, afflictions, which happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra—what persecutions I endured. And out of them all the Lord delivered me. 12 Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</p>
<p><strong>1st Peter 4:12-19<br />
</strong>12 Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; 13 but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. 14 If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. 15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people’s matters. 16 Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter.<br />
17 For the time has come for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if it begins with us first, what will be the end of those who do not obey the gospel of God? 18 Now<br />
“If the righteous one is scarcely saved, Where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?”  19 Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.</p>
<p><strong>1st Peter 5:1-11</strong><br />
1 The elders who are among you I exhort, I who am a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that will be revealed: 2 Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly; 3 nor as being lords over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock; 4 and when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away. 5 Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for “God resists the proud,</p>
<p><strong>But gives grace to the humble.”</strong>  6 Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time, 7 casting all your care upon Him, for He cares for you.  8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour. 9 Resist him, steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. 10 But may the God of all grace, who called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you. 11 To Him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>Trials And Prayer Are Training Ground<br />
</strong>We now come to the heart of this study.  The process of renewing our minds from sinner to Christ-likeness is carried out in our lives (as Christians) by trials and prayer.  Why does God choose to shape us in this manner?  In His sovereign knowledge and wisdom, He uses these tools to take us out of a self-centered, sin-oriented, self-reliant life and lifestyle; and to move us into a God-centered, holy-living, Spirit-led and Christ-reliant life.  These tools strengthen our faith, open our eyes to the spiritual reality that surrounds us, cause us to communicate often with our Lord, change our focus from ourselves to Him, gives more of a heart for others, and helps us to see others as He sees them.  It is the key to the development of the Christ-like mindset and character, as seen below.</p>
<p>The conditions of prayer reflect the “transformed mind” and Christ-like character that God desires to shape us into:<br />
Purity of heart     Psalm 66:18-19  Faith     Matt. 21:22<br />
In Jesus’ name     John 14:13 According to God’s will     1 John 5:14<br />
Forgiving spirit     Matt. 6:14  Humility and repentance     Luke 18:10–14<br />
Unity of believers     Matt. 18:19-20 Tenacity     Luke 18:1–8<br />
Persistence     Luke 11:5–9  Confident expectation     Mark 11:24<br />
Without empty phrases     Matt. 6:7 Unceasingly     1 Thess. 5:17</p>
<p>The hindrances to prayer are the very characteristics that God is seeking to remove from our lives, mind, and character:</p>
<p>Sin     Ps. 66:18  Selfishness     James 4:3 Doubt     James 1:5–7<br />
Lawlessness     Proverbs 28:9 Inhumanity     Proverbs 21:13<br />
Pride     Luke 18:10-14  Pretense     Mark 12:40</p>
<p> <strong>Notes On Spiritual Gifts  1 Corinthians 12<br />
</strong>[Now there are diversities of gifts] There are different endowments conferred on Christians. Produced by the same Spirit-the Holy Spirit. What those diversities of gifts are, the apostle enumerates in 1 Cor 12:8-11. The design for which he refers to these various endowments is evidently to show those whom he addressed, that since they are all produced by the same Holy Spirit, have all the same divine origin, and are all intended to answer some important purpose and end in the Christian church, that, therefore, none are to be despised; nor is one man to regard himself as authorized to treat another with contempt. The Spirit has divided and conferred those gifts according to his sovereign will; and his arrangements should be regarded with submission, and the favors which he confers should be received with thankfulness.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 12:7<br />
</strong>The idea is not at all that the manifestation of the Spirit is given to all people indiscriminately, to pagans, and infidels, and scoffers as well as to Christians. The apostle is discoursing only of those who are Christians, and his declaration should be confined to them alone. Whatever may be true of other people, this statement should be confined wholly to Christians, and means simply that the Spirit of God gives to each Christian such graces and endowments as he pleases; that he distributes his gifts to all, not equally, but in a manner which he shall choose; and that the design of this is, that all Christians should use his endowments for the common good.  Unto profit; that is, for utility, or use; or to be an advantage to the church; for the common good of all. This does not mean that each one must cultivate and improve his graces and gifts, however true that may be, but that they are to be used for the common good of the church; they are bestowed &#8220;for utility,&#8221; or &#8220;profit;&#8221; they are conferred in such measures and in such a manner as are best adapted to be useful, and to do good. They are bestowed not on all equally, but in such a manner as shall best serve the interests of piety and the church, and as shall tend harmoniously to carry on the great interests of religion, and further the welfare of the whole Christian body.</p>
<p><strong>1 Cor 12:11</strong><br />
[Dividing to every man severally] Conferring on each one as he pleases. He confers on each one that which he sees to be best, and most wise, and proper.<br />
[As he will] As he chooses or as in his view seems best. Dr. Doddridge remarks, that this word does &#8220;not so much express arbitrary pleasure, as a determination founded on &#8220;wise&#8221; counsel.&#8221; It implies, however, that he does it as a sovereign; as he sees to be right and best. He distributes these favors as to him seems best adapted to promote the welfare of the whole church and to advance his cause. (from Barnes&#8217; Notes, Electronic Database. Copyright (c) 1997 by Biblesoft)</p>
<p>The answers that Paul has given to the Corinthians&#8217; questions thus far in this letter have focused on unity among believers, order in the church, and exaltation of Jesus Christ. So with the concern about spiritual gifts, Paul was concerned that the Corinthians&#8217; focus on any particular gift, such as &#8220;tongues,&#8221; or ecstatic speech, would tear them apart. While the specific question is unknown, Paul clearly wanted the believers to understand that tongues had their place but should not be sought by everyone. In the broad context of spiritual gifts, the gift of tongues was just one gift. There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, different kinds of service in the church, and different ways God works in our lives.</p>
<p>God&#8217;s people receive many kinds of gifts, and no one gift is better than another. All the gifts come from one source and are to be used for one purpose&#8211;the building up of the body of Christ. These gifts are just that&#8211;gifts. They are not earned. They are not given to believers asking for a specific one. They are not chosen by people. God alone administers the gifts among his people. God, not believers, controls the gifts. Each believer, then, is responsible to seek God&#8217;s guidance in discovering his or her particular gift(s) and then discovering how best to use them for God&#8217;s purposes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6> Question #1  &#8220;Do good people go to Heaven?&#8221;</h6>
<p>This question is often asked by people who question God&#8217;s goodness.  If God is good and loving (they ask), then why do people who are good in earthly terms not &#8220;make it&#8221; into Heaven?  There are a lot of people in the world who are kind, compassionate, help others, are never mean, who never commit adultery, never steal, and whom everybody likes and gets along with.  Why would God say that they can&#8217;t go to Heaven when they die?  Let&#8217;s see how the Bible answers this question&#8230;<span id="more-1182"></span></p>
<p>A) There is NOT ONE truly good person on earth at all.<br />
 Ecclesiastes 7:20<br />
 Romans 3:10-18<br />
B) The things that WE call Good (good works, pleasant personality, etc.), God calls FILTHY RAGS.<br />
 Isaiah 64:6<br />
C) God has made ONE way of Salvation, but He has made it available to ALL people.  If we ignore it, and go to hell, whose fault is it?<br />
 John 14:6<br />
 Romans 1:20-23<br />
 Hebrews 2:3-4<br />
 Romans 5:6-8<br />
 1st John 4:9-10<br />
 2nd Peter 3:9<br />
 John 3:16-21</p>
<p>D) The standard to get into Heaven isn&#8217;t GOOD, it&#8217;s PERFECT.  Do you know anyone who is perfect?<br />
 Deuteronomy 32:4<br />
 Matthew 4:45<br />
 John 17:20-23<br />
 Colossians 1:27-28<br />
 Hebrews 13:20-21<br />
 Revelation 21:23-27</p>
<h6>Question #2:  &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it arrogant to say that you are right and all other religions are wrong?&#8221;</h6>
<p>This question is usually asked by people who refuse to accept the idea of an absolute truth.  They want to believe that all roads lead to Heaven, and that WHAT you believe isn&#8217;t really important.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s see how the Bible answers this question&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>A)God Created Us, Therefore Our Worship Belongs Only To Him.<br />
 Genesis 1:1<br />
 Genesis 1:26-31<br />
 </p>
<p>B) The God Of The Bible Is The Only One Who Deals With The Sin Problem.<br />
 Romans 5:6-21<br />
C) Of All The Religious Texts, Only The Bible Stands Up To Scrutiny And Testing.<br />
 As has been covered in other Bible Studies, there is AMPLE evidence that the world was created in a short period of time AS THE BIBLE STATES; that there was a world-wide flood AS THE BIBLE STATES; that the history of peoples, nations, and even various named individuals existed exactly AS THE BIBLE STATES; that the nature of the universe, and the foundations of science are formed by design AS THE BIBLE STATES.  In light of this vast difference between the Bible and the religious texts of other religions, we can say with assurance that the Bible IS true, and the others ARE not true.<br />
 <br />
D) God&#8217;s Word Is Mutually Exclusive Of Other Religions; They Can&#8217;t Both Be Right.<br />
 John 14:6<br />
 Acts 4:10-12<br />
 Exodus 20:3</p>
<h6>Question #3:  Why does God heal some peoples illnesses and injuries, and not others?&#8221;</h6>
<p>This question is usually asked by people who either do not understand the issue of God&#8217;s absolute sovereignty, or who do not accept it if they DO understand it.</p>
<p><strong> Let&#8217;s see how the Bible answers this question&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>A) God created us, we belong to Him, and He can do as He wills.<br />
 Job 34:12-15<br />
 Isaiah 64:8<br />
 Romans 9:14-21<br />
 <br />
B) God has a plan for each life, and only He can see the ultimate outcome of each action.  We may THINK we know what is best, but His wisdom is far beyond ours.<br />
 Job 36:26 &#8211; 37:5</p>
<p>C) God sometimes uses our infirmities to demonstrate His power and glory.<br />
 John 9:1-7<br />
 Job 2:1-10</p>
<p>D) God sometimes uses our infirmities to keep us in a state of humility and dependence upon Him.<br />
 2nd Corinthians 12:6-10</p>
<h6>Question #4:  &#8220;Why did God make the Bible so hard to understand?&#8221;</h6>
<p>This question is usually asked by people who have never really taken the time to try and understand the Bible.  They pick it up, look through it to see if it has any quick and easy answers, and then put it down again.  They don&#8217;t understand that the Bible is a book that has many levels of information.  What you need to know for salvation is actually very simple (simple enough for a child to understand); what you need for Christian growth and maturity takes more study to understand; and &#8220;the deep things of God&#8221; (prophecy, and so forth) take much more study.</p>
<p><strong> Let&#8217;s see how the Bible answers this question&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>A) The Bible is not just a book you read; it is a book you STUDY<br />
 2nd Timothy 2:15 <br />
 Deuteronomy 6:4-7<br />
B) The Bible must be studied because it is a book of doctrine (teachings).<br />
 2nd Timothy 3:16-17<br />
 </p>
<p>C) The Bible must be studied because it has a spiritual impact.<br />
 Psalm 119:9-11<br />
 John 17:17<br />
 Acts 17:10-12<br />
D) God established the church to be a place where His Word is taught, not just read.<br />
 John 7:14<br />
 Acts 18:8-11<br />
E) The Bible opens itself up to those who truly and persistently seek<br />
Matthew 7:7-11</p>
<h6>Question #5  &#8221;If Christians are supposed to love each other, why are there so many denominations, and why can&#8217;t they get along with each other?&#8221;</h6>
<p>This is actually a good question.  From the outside (and even from the inside, sometimes) Christianity looks like a bunch of squabbling factions that call each other names.  Why is this, and how can we sort out the truth?</p>
<p><strong> Let&#8217;s see how the Bible answers this question&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>1) Different denominations or groups start for a variety of reasons.  Some start because of divisions among believers that escalate into fights; others because of people who lead folks astray with false doctrine for personal gain; others who begin to teach false doctrine that they sincerely believe in, but are sincerely WRONG.  Other times, different groups start because people follow a specific human leader, elevating him in status above all others.<br />
SEE:  Romans 16:17-18<br />
 2nd Timothy 4:3-4<br />
 1st Corinthians 3:3-9<br />
 1st Corinthians 1:10-13</p>
<p>2) Sometimes, different groups start because of differences in PRACTICES.  As long as their DOCTRINE is pure, and their practices are in line with that doctrine, there is room for variation in the Body of Christ, and believers should allow others to live out their Christianity in that light.  This does NOT mean that we put up with heresy or false DOCTRINE; or PRACTICES that deny or violate pure doctrine; but we should allow people to be different from us WITHIN pure doctrine.<br />
SEE: Mark 9:38-40<br />
 Colossians 2:16-17<br />
 Romans 14:1-13</p>
<p>3) The pure Church that is the Body of Christ, which extends across all social, racial, economic, and national boundaries is the Church that holds to and teaches the WHOLE doctrine of Scripture, and NONE OTHER.<br />
See: 2nd Timothy 3:16  &amp; Galatians 1:6-9</p>
<h6>Question #6:  &#8221;Why should I go to a Church?  I can have a relationship with God on my own and worship him at the lake or on the golf course just as well, can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</h6>
<p>This question is usually asked by people that don&#8217;t want to schedule specific time for God in their life, and who are trying to look for an &#8220;out&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>Let&#8217;s see how the Bible answers this question&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>In Hebrews 10:23-25, we see a direct command to assemble together as the &#8220;church&#8221; (the gathering of saved people), but it doesn&#8217;t really tell us what the congregate church is to do.  However, in Acts 2:42-47, we have a very complete list of the activities of the early church following Pentecost.  This list is still applicable to the church universal today, and serves as a blueprint of the multi-fold task of the congregate church.</p>
<p>1) To teach and maintain the APOSTLES&#8217; DOCTRINE.<br />
 Galatians 1:6-9<br />
2) To have fellowship with each other.<br />
 1st John 1:1-4<br />
3) To engage in friendly social contact as the Family of God.<br />
 Romans 8:15-16<br />
  John 13:34-35<br />
4) To pray together.<br />
 Acts 4:31<br />
 Acts 12:12<br />
5) To provide for the common support and good of the group (Benevolence).<br />
 Acts 11:27-30<br />
6) To give public testimony of the Gospel to the unbelieving world.<br />
 Matthew 28:18-20<br />
7) To praise and worship God<br />
 Hebrews 2:11-12<br />
 Romans 15:5-6<br />
8) To give public witness of the power of the Gospel by demonstrating changed                                           <br />
     lives that show the fruit of the Spirit.<br />
 Matthew 5:14-16<br />
 Galatians 5:22-23<br />
 1st Thessalonians 5:15</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>Lesson 1:  Introduction</h6>
<p>The word “type” is derived from a Greek term [tupos], which occurs 16 times in the New Testament.  One general idea is common to all, namely, “likeness.” A person, event or thing is shaped to resemble another; in some ways the one matches the other. The two are called type and antitype; and the link that binds them together is the similarity of the one with the other.</p>
<p><span id="more-1179"></span></p>
<p><strong>Three other words in the New Testament express the same general idea.</strong></p>
<p>One is “shadow” ([skia], Hebrews 10:1), “For the law having a shadow of the good things to come” — as if the substance or reality that was still future cast its shadow backward into the Old Testament.  “Shadow” implies dimness and temporariness; but it also implies a resemblance between the one and the other.</p>
<p>The 2nd term is “parable” ([parabole], Hebrews 9:9); the tabernacle with its services was an acted parable for the time then present, pre-figuring the blessed reality that was to come.</p>
<p>The 3rd term is “copy.” or “pattern” ([hupodeigma]), a word that denotes a sketch or draft of something future and (at that point) invisible (Hebrews 9:23); the tabernacle and its furniture and services were copies, outlines of heavenly things.</p>
<p>Types are pictures, object lessons, by which God taught His people concerning His grace and saving power. </p>
<p><strong>CLASSIFICATION OF TYPES:<br />
</strong>1) Personal types, such as those people of Scripture whose lives and experiences illustrate some principle or truth of redemption. Such are Adam, who is expressly described as the “figure of him that was to come”  (Romans 5:14), Melchizedek, Abraham, Aaron, Joseph, Jonah, etc.<br />
    2) Historical types, in which are included the great historical events<br />
          that became striking foreshadowings of good things to come, e.g. the       <br />
          Deliverance from the Bondage of Egypt; the Wilderness Journey; the <br />
          Conquest of Canaan; the Call of Abraham; Deliverances by the <br />
          Judges, etc. <br />
    3)  Ritual or Physical types, such as the Altar, the Offerings, the  <br />
           Priesthood, the Tabernacle and its furniture, etc.<br />
Now let’s begin our study of types in Scripture.</p>
<p><strong>SKINS —</strong> Genesis 3:21 &#8212; This is a type of the righteousness given as a covering to all who trust Christ Jesus. We are clothed with the garments of salvation, and with the robe of righteousness when we trust Jesus Christ, and He becomes the Lord of our lives. (See Isaiah 61:10; Leviticus 7:8.) The animal must die that we might be clothed. So the Savior must die, and did die, so that we might have the righteousness of God put upon us. (See also Romans 3:22.)</p>
<p><strong>NAMES IN GENESIS 5:</strong> So many times, we tend to skip over the names listed in Scripture because they are awkward to our tongue, and because we aren’t used to people’s “given names” being especially significant.  However, we need to remember that although most Bible translations merely “transliterate” the names (meaning that they merely put the sound of the name into English letters as closely as possible), God caused certain people to be named certain things because of what the name MEANS in “translation” (meaning the definition of the name, rather than just its’ sound).</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this was compiled by a Bible Teacher named Chuck Missler.  In studying the TRANSLATION (not just the transliteration) of the names given to the first ten generations of the “godly line” listed in Genesis 5, Missler found that God had given the plan of redemption to the world as a promise through the names of each godly man.  Here is a summary of God’s plan of redemption, hidden in Genesis chapter 5.</p>
<p>Hebrew Name English Meaning<br />
Adam Man<br />
Seth Appointed<br />
Enosh Mortal<br />
Kenan Sorrow;<br />
Mahalalel The Blessed God<br />
Jared Shall come down<br />
Enoch Teaching<br />
Methuselah His death shall bring<br />
Lamech The despairing<br />
Noah Rest, or comfort</p>
<p>“Man (is) appointed mortal sorrow; (but) the Blessed God shall come down teaching (that) His death shall bring (the) despairing rest.”</p>
<p>Is that remarkable, or what?</p>
<h6>Lesson 2:  The Sacrifices &amp; Offerings In Leviticus</h6>
<p>It is important to notice that God ordained 5 Levitical sacrifices, because 5 is the symbolic number of grace, and the sacrificial system was always an object of God’s GRACE, since it was God’s choice to allow substitutionary atonement in the first place.  Most “New Testament” Christians don’t realize that GRACE is the topic of BOTH the Old and New Testaments.</p>
<p><strong>The Law of the Burnt Offering (Olah):</strong></p>
<p><strong>The law of the burnt offering is found in Leviticus 1.</strong> <br />
(1) Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 1:3-17).   This may have been from the herd or flock or fowls, brought to the tent of meeting; hands were laid (heavily) upon its head designating it as the offerer’s substitute, it was killed, flayed and cut in pieces. If of the flock, it was to be killed on the north side of the altar; if a fowl, the priest must kill it.</p>
<p>(2) Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 1:3-17).   If a bullock or of the flock, the priest was to sprinkle the blood round about the altar, put on the fire, lay the wood and pieces of the carcass, wash the inwards, legs, etc., and burn it all as a sweet savor to God. If a fowl, he must wring the neck, drain out the blood on the side of the altar, cast the crop, filth, etc., among the ashes, rend the wings without dividing the bird and burn the carcass on the altar.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this offering:  We see Christ in both “sides” of this sacrifice; both God’s “side” and the sinners “side”.  For the sinner, this sacrifice deals with sin through the death of the substitute, whom the sinner must DIRECTLY IDENTIFY WITH (by placing his hands on it and praying over it).  In the same manner, we cannot be saved unless we DIRECTLY IDENTIFY with Christ as our Savior, thus applying His death to our life.  From God’s “side”, we see that Christ is the “best of the flock”, whole, and without blemish; as was necessary for this sacrifice.  Also, He is the WHOLE burnt offering, given totally to God, without reservation.</p>
<p><strong>The Law of the Meal Offering (Minchah):</strong><br />
The term “meal offering” is here confined to offerings of flour or meal, etc.<br />
(The King James Version “meat-offering”, where the word “meat” simply means any food), and was first used at the consecration of Aaron and his sons (Exodus 29:41).</p>
<p>(1) Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 2:1-16).   It must be of fine flour, with oil and frankincense added, and brought to the priest; if baked in the oven, unleavened cakes mingled with oil, or wafers and oil; if of the baking pan, fine flour mingled with oil parted into pieces and oil thereon; if of the frying pan, the same ingredients. Leaven and honey must never be used as they quickly become corrupt. Every offering must be seasoned with salt. If of the first-fruits (bikkurim), it should consist of grain in the ear, parched with oil and frankincense upon it.</p>
<p>(2) Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 2:1-16).   This required him to take out a handful with the oil and frankincense thereon and burn it as a memorial upon the altar. The remainder was holy and belonged to the priest. Of the cakes, after bringing them to the altar, he was to take a portion, burn it and appropriate the remainder; the same with the first-fruits.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this sacrifice:  The Hebrew word for the “meal” (flour/cereal) sacrifice is “mincha”, meaning an offering from an INFERIOR to a SUPERIOR.  The word is sometimes translated as “present”, as in the story of Jacob sending “presents” to his brother Esau to forestall his wrath.  It is also used this way in the story of Joseph, when his brothers bring “presents” to Joseph (before they know he is their brother) to influence him to return their younger brother whom Joseph wants to keep.  Jesus is the “fruit of the ground”, the “ear of corn that falls to the ground and dies” producing a great harvest.  He provides FOR US the only gift that is GOOD ENOUGH for God.  We, the INFERIOR, must give gift a to God that is WORTHY of Him, but OUR righteousness is “as filthy rags”.  You wouldn’t give filthy rags as a gift to the president of the United States would you?  In Christ, we are able to give His perfection and righteousness back to God on our own behalf.  Just as in the Meal Offering, GOD had caused the grain to grow, but the offerer gave it back to Him.  GOD sent His Son into the world, and we “give Him back” to God in place our own righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>The Law of the Peace Offering:<br />
</strong>The peace offerings indicated right relations with God, expressing good-fellowship, gratitude and obligation. The common altars were fitted for their use (Exodus 20:24), as feasts had been thus celebrated from time<br />
immemorial. At the feast before God on the Mount, peace offerings provided the food (Exodus 24:5); also before the golden bull (Exodus 32:6). The wave offerings and heave offerings were portions of these.</p>
<p>(1) Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 3:1-17).   The offering might be a bullock, a lamb, or a goat, either male or female, latitude being allowed in this case. The ritual was the same as in the case of the burnt offering.</p>
<p>(2) Ritual for the Priest (Leviticus 3:1-17).   Blood must be sprinkled on the altar round about, the caul, the liver and the kidneys must be taken away and the fat parts burned on the altar; the fat tail of the lamb must also be burned. These portions were offerings of food by fire to the Deity. The ritual for a goat was the same as for a bullock.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this sacrifice: This was the only sacrifice where the sinner and the priest would eat part of it together, initiating the common bond of hospitality (which was crucially important in Middle Eastern thinking).  This sacrifice was the Old Testament equivalent of COMMUNION.  When we come to the Lord’s Table to share in Communion, we are “feasting” (symbolically) on what God has provided, and we acknowledge that we are at peace with God through Jesus Christ.  See Luke 2:14, Colossians 1:20, Ephesians 2:14.</p>
<p><strong>Law of the offering:<br />
The Law of the Sin Offering (Leviticus 4:1-35; 24-30, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>(1) The Occasion and Meaning:<br />
Specifically to atone for unwitting sins, sins of error (sheghaghah),<br />
mistakes or rash acts, unknown at the time, but afterward made known.<br />
There were gradations of these for several classes of offenders: the<br />
anointed priest (Leviticus 4:3-12), the whole congregation (Leviticus 4:13-21), a ruler (Leviticus 4:22-26), one of the common people (Leviticus 4:27-35), forswearing (5:1), touching an unclean thing (Leviticus 5:2) or the uncleanness of man (Leviticus 5:3), or rashly swearing in ignorance (Leviticus 5:4). For conscious and willful violations of the Law, no atonement was possible, with some exceptions, for which provision was made in the guilt offerings.</p>
<p>(2) Ritual for the Offerer (Leviticus 4:1-5,13, etc.):<br />
The anointed priest must offer a bullock at the tent of meeting, lay his<br />
hands upon it and slay it before Yahweh. The congregation was also<br />
required to bring a young bullock before the tent of meeting, the elders<br />
were to lay hands upon it and slay it before Yahweh. The ruler must bring<br />
a he-goat and do the same. One of the common people might bring a she-goat or lamb and present it in the same manner. If too poor for these, two<br />
turtledoves or young pigeons, one for a sin offering and one for burnt<br />
offering, would suffice. If too poor for these, the tenth part of an ephah of<br />
fine flour without oil or frankincense would suffice.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this sacrifice: Jesus is indeed our SIN OFFERING, making atonement for us in His death.  See Romans 8:3, 2nd Corinthians 5:21.<br />
The Guilt Offering:<br />
The guilt offering (the King James Version “trespass offering”)<br />
(Leviticus 5:14 through 6:7) was a special kind of sin offering, always<br />
of a private character and accompanied by a fine. It expressed expiation<br />
and restitution. The classes of sin requiring a guilt offering with reparation<br />
in money are:<br />
(1) a trespass in the holy things done unwittingly;<br />
(2) anything which the Law forbade depriving God or the priest of their<br />
due;<br />
(3) dealing falsely, with a neighbor in a deposit, or pledge, or robbery,<br />
or oppression;<br />
(4) swearing falsely regarding anything lost;<br />
(5) seduction of a betrothed bondmaid (Leviticus 19:20-22). The<br />
first two of these are unwitting sins, the others cannot be.</p>
<p><strong>The Ritual (Leviticus 5:14 through 6:7).<br />
</strong>A ram proportionate in value to the offense and worth at least two shekels is required. The ritual is probably the same as that of the sin offering, though no mention is made of the laying on of hands, and the blood is not brought into the sanctuary, but sprinkled about the base of the altar, the fat and inside parts being burned, and the flesh eaten by the priests in a holy place.</p>
<p>Christ seen in this sacrifice:  See Isaiah 53:8, 2nd Corinthians 5:19, Colossians 2:13-14.  We have ALL sinned and come short of the glory of God, and are GUILTY of treason (against our Creator), filthiness (spiritually), and sin.  Only in Christ can our guilt (trespass) be cleansed.</p>
<p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong>  The Mosaic sacrifices given in Leviticus show the life, death, and ministry of Christ in its’ various facets.  The entire story is one of God showing grace to mankind, making provision for our sin to be cleansed, and providing a way for sinners to have fellowship with the Holy and Righteous God.  Christ is the True Sacrifice, that living Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</p>
<h6>Lesson 3:  The Feasts In Leviticus</h6>
<p>With all of the Bible studying that we do, there is one very plain teaching of God that is ignored by most, taught by few, and yet may have the most significant impact on your understanding of the Good News of Messiah, of God’s plan, and of salvation.</p>
<p>That teaching is God’s plan for mankind that is revealed right in the Scriptures, just waiting for us to find and understand! I am speaking of how God has outlined this plan and given it to the very people who He chose to bring the Scriptures to us today. That teaching which God passed down to us through the Jewish people is His prophetic calendar.</p>
<p>Most people think of a calendar only as the way in which we conveniently mark the passing of the days, synchronizing it periodically so that it coordinates with the seasons. Obviously people need a calendar, and so God created one that would not only help people keep track of the seasons, would not only be a way of remembering when to celebrate events in the eternal relationship between God and His children, but  would also be a way to pass down and foreshadow this plan for mankind.</p>
<p>There are 2 different words used in Leviticus to describe the feasts.  They are: </p>
<p>Mo’ed – which means “an appointment, a fixed time or season, an “Assembly”. Used in Leviticus 23:2</p>
<p>Chag – meaning festival, derived from the Hebrew word chagag, which means to “move in a circle, to march in a sacred procession, to celebrate and dance”.  Used in Leviticus 23:6</p>
<p>Thus we see that God’s feasts are appointments with mankind that God has set, and that we should keep (or at least study) because He has set these times for a purpose.  Also, they are to be times of joy, as God’s message to man is revealed to us: His grace, power, love, redemption, and provision are all shown in the feasts, and give us cause to rejoice.</p>
<p>Another word that is used in Leviticus, starting in 23:2 is translated into English as “convocation”, but in Hebrew is “miqra”, which literally means “rehearsal”.  Thus we also see that the feasts, as we celebrate them, are rehearsals for future events relating to our redemption.</p>
<p><strong>How Christ Is Seen In The Feasts (Summary)<br />
</strong>Passover speaks of the substitutionary death of the Lamb of God. Christ died on the day of Passover. Unleavened Bread speaks of the holy walk of the believer (1 Cor. 5:6–8). Firstfruits speaks of Christ’s resurrection as the firstfruit of the resurrection of all believers (1 Cor. 15:20–23). Christ rose on the day of the Firstfruits. Pentecost speaks of the descent of the Holy Spirit after Christ’s ascension. Trumpets, the Day of Atonement, and Tabernacles speak of events associated with the second advent of Christ. This may be why these three are separated by a long gap from the first four in Israel’s annual cycle.</p>
<p><strong>THE NEW YEAR<br />
</strong>In studying God’s prophetic calendar, it would make sense to start at the beginning. But there are at least two &#8220;beginnings.&#8221; The first was given by God during the Exodus from Egypt, and is written about in Exodus 12:1-3<br />
God said to Moses and Aaron in Egypt, &#8220;This month is to be for you the first month, the first month of your year. Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family, one for each household.&#8221;   This Scripture is speaking of the month of Nisan (at that time called &#8220;Aviv&#8221;), in which we find Pesach (Passover). God gave this month as the beginning of the year for the Israelites because they had been &#8220;redeemed&#8221; or &#8220;saved&#8221; or &#8220;reborn&#8221; as a people, brought out from slavery in Egypt. This time of the year was to mark a celebration of Pesach for all eternity. It is the New Year for the Nation of Israel.  Notice that there are 2 “New Years”; Civil (Rosh Hashanah) and Religious (Passover), just as there are 2 “beginnings” for people.  You are “BORN”, and have earthly (CIVIL) life, but you must also be “BORN AGAIN” through the Lamb of God (PASSOVER) to have SPIRITUAL life also.</p>
<p><strong>ROSH HASHANAH &#8211; THE NEW YEAR ALSO<br />
</strong>Most of us have also heard of Rosh Hashanah, (&#8220;Yom Teruah&#8221; in the Bible) which is commonly known as the &#8220;Jewish New Year.&#8221;  Rosh HaShanah literally means the &#8220;head of the year.&#8221; But it is not the beginning of the &#8220;new year&#8221; according to God. Since the exodus, that has been the month in which God told us to celebrate Pesach. It is believed that this date, the 1st day of Tishri, designates the creation of the world. Therefore it is not only the anniversary of the beginning of the world and the beginning of our relationship with God, but it represents the beginning of the bringing about of His Plan  — His plan for bringing to completion the perfecting of His relationship with us. For this reason the modern &#8220;Jewish&#8221; calendar starts with 1 Tishri, as does God’s &#8220;prophetic&#8221; calendar.</p>
<p>It is interesting and useful to look at the rabbinic interpretations of these feasts and festivals, and it is a curious fact that Rosh Hashanah is conspicuously lacking in the same sort of imagery and symbolism that the other holy days are. We are told that Rosh Hashanah is the &#8220;Day of the Blowing of the Shofar&#8221; (Yom Teruah). A shofar is the rams-horn trumpet that God commanded be blown on this day. Rosh Hashanah is the start of the ten days of introspection leading up to Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement. But even more interesting than Rosh Hashanah on the 1st of Tishri and Yom Kippur on the 10th of Tishri is another festival, Sukkot (&#8220;Feast of Tabernacles&#8221;) that occurs on the 15th of Tishri.   The cycle of God’s prophetic calendar actually comes together at the Feast of Tabernacles, when, we believe, Messiah Jesus came to &#8220;tabernacle among us&#8221; and was born in the flesh in Bethlehem about 2,000 years ago. So to start our study we will, for now, pass by these three occurrences in the month of Tishri, and start just after Jesus&#8217;s birth. As in all calendars, the end of one era is the beginning of the next, and this month of Tishri is both the beginning and the end of God’s prophetic calendar.</p>
<p><strong><em>Let us then continue from that point on through the prophetic year.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>PESACH (PASSOVER)/Feast of Unleavened Bread<br />
</strong>The next redemption festival is Pesach (&#8220;Passover&#8221;), whose theme is redemption from slavery. Passover starts &#8220;between the lights&#8221; at the end of the 13th of Nisan and the beginning of the 14th of Nisan. The &#8220;Feast of Unleavened Bread&#8221; begins the evening at the start of the 15th. Both have become known collectively as Passover. Again, as prophecy it has more than one focus and purpose. In celebrating Pesach we celebrate and remember and thank God for redeeming His people from slavery in Egypt. But for us now, in the last days, Pesach represents the redemption that is available to us through God — redemption from slavery to sin. That is why on Passover God has made us focus on removing from our homes and from our lives yeast, or leaven, which represents sin.   But did the Jewish people prior to Jesus put this together, and understand its prophetic significance? Yes! There always has been in Jewish tradition a dual reason for eating the unleavened bread on Passover. One was because when the children of Israel had to leave Egypt in haste, there was not time for the dough that they had made to rise, to leaven, so they ended up eating flat bread. But in the first letter that the Apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthians, in chapter 5 verses 6-8 it is written:  “Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know the [old] saying, &#8220;It takes only a little Leaven to leaven a whole batch of dough?&#8221; Get rid of the old Leaven, so that you can be a new batch of dough, because in reality you are unleavened. For our Pesach Lamb, the Messiah has been sacrificed. So let us celebrate the [Passover] seder, not with leftover leaven, the leaven of wickedness and evil, but with the matzah [unleavened bread] of purity and truth.”</p>
<p>Passover points to redemption from sin. But even more important than that, it foreshadows the way in which God was going to allow us to have complete and eternal redemption from sin! The Passover Lamb! Tell me, what sense would it have made to anyone for John the Baptizer to proclaim of Jesus, &#8220;Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&#8221; if the lamb didn’t already represent the Messiah? And what sense would it have made to Jesus’s disciples for Him to show them the symbolism of His body and blood?  Redemption from assimilation both voluntary and forced — redemption from Sin — and the way to salvation.</p>
<p>The first day of the week, following the Sabbath of Passover week, is First Firstfruits, and is symbolic of redemption and salvation, making it highly important that Jesus was resurrected on this day.  This is due to the historic events associated with this particular date, which are:<br />
  Noah’s Ark comes to rest on Mount Ararat (Genesis 8:4).<br />
  Israel crosses the Red Sea (Exodus 3:18, 5:3, 5:14).<br />
  Israel eats the firstfruits of the Promised Land (Joshua 5:10-12).<br />
  Haman is defeated (Esther 3:1-6).</p>
<p><strong>SHAVUOT<br />
</strong>The next festival in the prophetic calendar is Shavuot or &#8220;Pentecost.&#8221; It is called Pentecost because it is celebrated on the fiftieth day counting from &#8220;Early Firstfruits&#8221; (Bikkurim), which is the day after Sabbath during Passover. Bikkurim represents the day when Jesus ascended to the right hand of the Father in Heaven. Jesus’s resurrection is celebrated as part of the Pesach/Feast of Unleavened Bread. The historical significance of Shavuot, or &#8220;Feast of Weeks,&#8221; besides being a day of celebration and thanking God for the early harvest, is that it is believed that the Torah, God’s perfect standard for His children, the first five books of the Bible, was given then on Mount Sinai. Of course this makes sense because it is also the day on which the Holy Spirit, was given to the believers in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Prophetically it represents now. It represents the time of the combined Jewish/Gentile Church, empowered by the Spirit.  This time will culminate in separation of the Godly REMNANT from the worldly FALSE CHURCH.  During this time of culmination, a number of Jews around the world will come to recognize Jesus as the Messiah of Israel. Also during this time the rest of the Body of Messiah will recognize the Jewish roots of their faith. It is the time of Revival in which &#8220;The TRUE Church&#8221; will begin to be pulled back to the righteousness of God.</p>
<p><strong>YOM TERUAH (ROSH HASHANAH)<br />
</strong>And now  we find ourselves back at the beginning &#8211; The day of the blowing of the ram’s horn.</p>
<p>It is written in Rev 10: 7:  “But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.”   This, then, is finally the purpose and the reason behind the &#8220;Feast of Trumpets.&#8221; This is why there is not a more complete, a more symbolic meaning traditionally given. This is indeed why it is not written in the Scriptures that Jesus celebrated this day. The prophetic completion of this day will come when the Messiah comes back for His children. And, indeed, it will be the start of the final &#8220;Days of Awe&#8221; as the Rabbis call it – the ten days leading up to the Day of Atonement. This is the period when all of those who would stand before the Judgment Throne and have their lives opened as a book would be pondering their lives, remembering all the times they purposely broke God’s Law, forgot about God and lived a worldly, assimilated, and sinful life.</p>
<p>The following are the names associated with the festival of Rosh Hashanah from Jewish and Rabbinical writings:<br />
 Teshuvah (repentance)<br />
 Rosh Hashanah (head of the year, birthday of the world)<br />
 Yom Teruah (Day of the awakening blast, feast of trumpets)<br />
 Yom HaDin (Day of Judgment)<br />
 Ha Melech (Coronation of the Messiah)<br />
 Yom Ha Zikkaron (Day of Remembrance, or Memorial)<br />
 Time of Jacobs Trouble (also, birthpangs of the Messiah)<br />
 The opening of the gates<br />
 Kiddushin/Nesu’in (the wedding ceremony)<br />
 Natzal (the resurrection of the dead)<br />
 Shofar (the last trumpet)<br />
 Yom Hakeseh (the hidden day)</p>
<p><strong>YOM KIPPUR<br />
</strong>Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement on the 10th of Tishri then represents the judgment. Too late to seek atonement. Too late to change, to repent, to turn back to God and to live a more godly lifestyle. The world as we know it will have ended and a new era will have begun on Rosh Hashanah — the &#8220;Head of the Year&#8221; — the blowing of the final trumpet call. Eternal life for believers would have started. And only one festival of God remains.</p>
<p><strong>SUKKOT<br />
</strong>Sukkot, the &#8220;Feast of Tabernacles&#8221; — commemorates when Jesus came to earth the first time to redeem us from our sins, when He came to earth as the suffering servant. In its final celebration it will signify when Messiah comes as the Lion of Judah &#8211; coming to reign over the earth in the Millennium.  It is quite evident from Scripture that Jesus was born on Sukkot, rather than in December (when we celebrate Christmas).  Thus John is quite right in his Gospel when he says, “The Word became flesh and DWELT (literally, TABERNACLED) among us.”</p>
<p>Names associated with Sukkot:<br />
 The Season of our Joy<br />
 The Festival of Ingathering<br />
 The feast of the Nations<br />
 </p>
<p>(1) To commemorate God’s deliverance and protection during the wilderness wanderings (23:43).<br />
(2) To rejoice in the completion of all the harvest (23:29).<br />
The Feast of Tabernacles foreshadows the peace and prosperity of the millennial reign of Christ (Zech. 14:16).</p>
<p>So you see &#8211; it is all there! It is all shown in the cycle we call the &#8220;Jewish Festivals.&#8221; But I want to close by showing you what God’s opinion is of whether they are only &#8220;Jewish Festivals.&#8221; God tells us about the festivals in a few places, but mainly in Leviticus chapter 23. It is written starting in verse 1:<br />
“God said to Moses, &#8220;Speak to Israel and say to them: &#8220;These are my appointed feasts, the appointed feasts of God, which you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies.&#8221;</p>
<h6>Lesson 4:  The Tabernacle</h6>
<p>Exod 25:1-9 Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying: &#8220;Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring Me an offering. From everyone who gives it willingly with his heart you shall take My offering&#8230; And let them make Me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. According to all that I show you, that is, the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furnishings, just so you shall make it.</p>
<p>The Tabernacle was a portable tent with a wooden framework to give it stability. The entire sanctuary consisted of three parts:</p>
<p>1. An outer court enclosed by curtains supported on pillars. It was oblong in shape and the entrance was on the east side.</p>
<p>2. The altar of sacrifice (bronze altar) was within the court, facing the entrance.</p>
<p>3. The Tabernacle itself was located at the western part of the court. The Tabernacle was divided by a veil or hanging curtain into two chambers. The first chamber was called the Holy Place, it contained the Table, Lampstand, and Altar of Incense. Only priests were allowed into this section. The second chamber was called the Holy of Holies, it contained the Ark of the Covenant. The High Priest the Holy of Holies only once a year on the Day of Atonement.</p>
<p>The Tabernacle area was 150 feet long and 75 feet wide. There was a 7 1/2 foot curtain made of fine white linen which were fastened to 60 supporting pillars of bronze surrounding it with one entrance through the eastern gate. Within the outer court were two articles of furniture, the bronze altar of sacrifice where all of the sacrifices were made, and the bronze laver of cleansing where the priests washed their hands and their feet.</p>
<p>The Tabernacle building itself stood at the West end of the court and was a wooden structure overlaid with gold 45 x 15 feet divided into two parts by a heavy curtain called the &#8220;Veil.&#8221; The entrance was a multicolored curtain door hanging on 5 pillars. The bigger part (30 x 15) of the tabernacle building was called &#8220;the holy place&#8221; and contained three golden articles of furniture. The golden lampstand that shined on the shewbread on the left, the table of shewbread that represented the people of God on the right, and the golden altar of incense that spoke of ever ascending prayers in the back. The smaller part (15 x 15) of the tabernacle building was called &#8220;the holy of holies&#8221; and contained only the ark of the covenant (the box that contained the two tables of the Law) and its lid, the mercy seat where the blood was sprinkled once per year by the high priest on the day of atonement.</p>
<p>So the tabernacle was the beginning of the visible reminders of a Spiritual God and His plan. Everything in the tabernacle was a type of Jesus. That is why God was so specific as to what they were to construct it with. They could not use one ounce of human imagination &#8220;Lest they die.&#8221; Gold, silver, bronze, the fine white linen, the four colors, the anointing oil, the incense, it all pointed to the One who, &#8220;became flesh and dwelt (literally tabernacled) among us.&#8221;<br />

<h6>Lesson 5:  The Placement Of The Tribes Around The Tabernacle</h6>
<p>Exod 12:37-38 Then the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children. A mixed multitude went up with them also, and flocks and herds&#8211; a great deal of livestock.</p>
<p>According to the Writings of Moses there were about 600,000 men and also women and children who left Egypt at the exodus. They came out of Egypt in rank and in file and as they journeyed in the wilderness the tribes would camp around the Tabernacle in God-specified locations.  To see the listing of how the tribes camped, see Numbers chapter 2.</p>
<p>Each of the twelve tribes had a specific area of the camp to live in. When their forefathers had moved south to Egypt approximately 400 years earlier they had done so as a family of twelve households, each headed by one of the sons of Jacob, who was renamed Israel by God. While they were slaves in Egypt they preserved their family divisions and over the years the families of the twelve sons had developed into tribal families or tribes.</p>
<p>The twelve tribes, in groups of three, were divinely situated at a certain distance around the tabernacle. Four of the tribes, Judah, Reuben, Ephraim and Dan were recognized as tribal leaders. Each had its own standard or banner identifying it as a tribal head while the other tribes had ensigns, a lesser type of banner.</p>
<p>Judah occupied the greatest area which was on the eastern side facing the tabernacle entrance behind the tents of Aaron. To their right was the tribe of Issachar and on the other side Zebulun. The tabernacle itself was always found in the very center of the camp with the tents of the various tribes set up at a certain distance. Judah (with Issachar and Zebulun) on the east numbering 186,400 men. Reuben (with Simeon and Gad) in the south numbering 151,450 men. West was Ephraim (with Manasseh and Benjamin) numbering 108,100 men. On the north side was Dan (with Asher and Naphtali) numbering 157,600 men. This brought the total count of men twenty years and upwards to 603,550, not including the tribe of Levi.</p>
<p>Num 2:2  Everyone of the children of Israel shall camp by his own standard, beside the emblems of his father&#8217;s house; they shall camp some distance from the tabernacle of meeting.</p>
<p>Each tribe had a specific banner:  According to Jewish history the banners of the tribes were as follows:</p>
<p>Judah &#8211; East (Lion of gold with a scarlet background).<br />
Ephraim &#8211; West (Ox of black on gold background).    <br />
Reuben &#8211; South (Man on gold background).               <br />
Dan &#8211; North (Eagle of gold on a blue background).    </p>
<p>Notice that this placement is the same as the placement of the cherubim around the throne of God in Ezekiel 1:1-10, and Revelation 4:2-8.  Since the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant was referred to as the “throne of God” because He would speak to Moses from there, it is important that the cherubim, who surround the throne in reality, are symbolized by the banners that surround the “throne” of the Tabernacle.</p>
<p><strong>The Levite Camp<br />
</strong>Camped just outside the tabernacle were the Levite tents. The Levites performed the priestly duties and therefore were mediators between God and the people. The tribe of Levi was divided into four families. Their tents were pitched between the tabernacle and the people, one family on each side. The Kohathites on the south numbering 8,600. The Gershonites on the west numbering 7,500. The Merarites on the north side numbering 6,200. On the eastern side were the tents of Moses, Aaron the high priest, and Aaron&#8217;s sons the priests.<br />
Camped in the center was God, a Type of Christ and His People</p>
<p>God camps with His people. His plan was always that He would dwell in us and be our God. He leads us, he cares for us and He speaks to us with the soft voice of a husband that is desperately in love with His bride. The flags of each tribe point to the real banner of God, Jesus Christ. The four faces and the four colors speak of Him. He is our standard. The Lord is called Jehovah Nissi (The Lord our banner). As the Levite stood between man and God so Jesus Christ stands between man and a holy wrathful God to be a mediator and to meet vengeance with mercy.</p>
<h6>Lesson 6:  Boaz (the Kinsman-Redeemer) and Red Heifer</h6>
<p><strong>BOAZ<br />
</strong>See Ruth 4:9-17<br />
“8 Therefore the close relative said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” So he took off his sandal. 9 And Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi. 10 Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, I have acquired as my wife, to perpetuate the name of the dead through his inheritance, that the name of the dead may not be cut off from among his brethren and from  his position at the gate. You are witnesses this day.”  11 And all the people who were at the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. The Lord make the woman who is coming to your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the house of Israel; and may you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem. 12 May your house be like the house of  Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of  the offspring which the Lord will give you from this young woman.”  13 So Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife; and when he went in to her, the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son. 14 Then  the women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a close relative; and may his name be famous in Israel! 15 And may he be to you a restorer of life and a nourisher of your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is  better to you than seven sons, has borne him.” 16 Then Naomi took the child and laid him on her bosom, and became a nurse to him. 17 Also the neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Naomi.” And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.”</p>
<p><strong><em>See:  John 1:14, Hebrews 2:9, 1st Peter 1:18-19, Ephesians 5:25-32</em></strong></p>
<p>In every place in Scripture where our redemption in Christ is mentioned, there is an allusion to the law of redemption among the Jews. This law is contained in the Book of Leviticus, ch. 25, where we find regulations laid down for a twofold redemption, a redemption of persons and a redemption of possessions. The redemption of possessions or inheritances is regulated, verses 23-28, and that of persons, from verse 47 to the end of the chapter. In both these cases, none had a right to redeem but either the person himself who had made the alienation, or some other that was near of kin to him. But none of Adam’s family ever was, or ever will be, able to redeem himself or others. ‘None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him; for the redemption of their soul is precious,’ Psalm 49:7. It is too precious to be accomplished by such means; and had there been no other, it would have ‘ceased for ever.’ All mankind had been engaged in a warfare against God, and, as rebels, were condemned to death. Satan had taken the whole human race captive, and employed them in the drudgery of sin. From the sentence of death and the slavery of sin, it was impossible for any of them ever to have been set free, if Christ had not paid the ransom of His blood. And, so that nothing might be undone either to demonstrate Him as our legal kinsman-Redeemer, He took on Himself our very nature, and in that nature paid our ransom in full. Thus He performs the part of the Redeemer of His people, redeeming them from slavery and from death, and redeeming for them that inheritance which they had forfeited, and which they could not redeem for themselves. In some cases both these sorts of redemption were conjoined, and the person redeemed (if female) was espoused to him who redeemed her; and in this manner our Lord Jesus Christ has redeemed His Church. Having redeemed the heavenly inheritance for her, He has at the same time redeemed her from her state of bondage, and has betrothed her to Himself. ‘I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in loving-kindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness; and thou shalt know the Lord,’  Hosea 2:19, 20.</p>
<p><strong>The Red Heifer<br />
</strong>Numbers 19:1-13<br />
“Now the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 2 “This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord has commanded, saying: ‘Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring you a red heifer without blemish, in which there is no defect and on which a yoke has never come. 3 You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, that he may take it outside the camp, and it shall be slaughtered before him; 4 and Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger, and sprinkle some of its blood seven times directly in front of the tabernacle of meeting. 5 Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight: its hide, its flesh, its blood, and its offal shall be burned. 6 And the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the fire burning the heifer. 7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, he shall bathe in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp; the priest shall be unclean until evening. 8 And the one who burns it shall wash his clothes in water, bathe in water, and shall be unclean until evening. 9 Then a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and store them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for the water of purification; it is for purifying from sin. 10 And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening. It shall be a statute forever to the children of Israel and to the stranger who dwells among them.  11 ‘He who touches the dead body of anyone shall be unclean seven days. 12 He shall purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day; then he will be clean. But if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean. 13 Whoever touches the body of anyone who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the Lord. That person shall be cut off from Israel. He shall be unclean, because the water of purification was not sprinkled on him; his uncleanness is still on him.”</p>
<p>The Red Heifer Sacrifice was for a 2-fold purpose; cleansing and regeneration.  We see the work of Christ’s sacrifice pictured here, as he cleanses and regenerates us by His death.</p>
<p>For those who are unclean due to contact with death:<br />
 See – Romans 6:21-23 and Romans 3:23</p>
<p>The Heifer must be perfect:<br />
 See – Hebrews 4:15</p>
<p>The Sacrifice was made outside the camp:<br />
 See – Hebrews 13:11-12</p>
<p>The sacrifice had to be applied to the unclean, the mere fact that it had been made was not enough:<br />
 See – John 3:16</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h6>LESSON 48 – Book Of James Lesson 1</h6>
<p>“James is a preacher who speaks like a prophet &#8230; in language which for forcibleness is without parallel in early Christian literature, excepting the discourses of Jesus.” —Theodor Zahn<br />
 <br />
This is a very practical Epistle. It deals with some unpopular subjects, such as controlling one’s tongue, the danger of kow-towing to the rich, and the need to show that our faith is real by our lives.</p>
<p><span id="more-1176"></span></p>
<p>Many Bible names were changed in their journey from Hebrew through Greek, Latin, and French into English. None is more different from its source than “James,” which translates Greek “Iakobos”, taken from Hebrew Yaakov (“Jacob”).  The author of this book is James, the half brother of our Lord (Matt. 13:55; Gal. 1:19).  Josephus tells us that James had a very good reputation for devotion to the law among Jews, but was martyred for witnessing for his Messiah when this was forbidden. This Jewish historian says that James was stoned by order of the high priest Ananias.  Josephus says James was killed in 62, so the Letter must predate that. Since the Epistle says nothing of the decisions on the law made at the Jerusalem Council (A.D. 48 or 49) over which meeting James presided (Acts 15), a date between A.D. 45 and 48 is widely accepted.</p>
<p><strong>TRIALS AND TEMPTATIONS (1:2–17)<br />
</strong>In this section James deals with the subject of temptation. He uses the word in two different senses. In verses 2–12, the temptations are what we might call holy trials or problems which are sent from God, and which test the reality of our faith and produce likeness to Christ. In verses 13–17, on the other hand, the subject is unholy temptations, which come from within, and which lead to sin.<br />
God is trying to produce Christlikeness in each of His children. This process necessarily involves suffering, frustration, and perplexity. The fruit of the Spirit cannot be produced when all is sunshine; there must be rain and dark clouds. Trials never seem pleasant; they seem very difficult and disagreeable. But afterwards they yield the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who are trained by them (Heb. 12:11). How often we hear a Christian say, after passing through some great crisis, “It wasn’t easy to take, but I wouldn’t give up the experience for anything.”<br />
 <br />
Starting in verse 13, the subject now shifts to unholy temptations (vv. 13–17). Just as holy trials are designed to bring out the best in us, so unholy temptations are designed to bring out the worst in us. One thing must be clearly understood. When we are tempted to sin, the temptation does not come from God. God does test or try men, as far as their faith is concerned, but He never tempts a man to commit any form of evil. He Himself has no dealings with evil, and He does not entice to sin.<br />
 <br />
If that is so, why then do we sin? Here is the answer: “Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin.”  Instead of expelling the vile thought, we may encourage, nourish, and enjoy it. This act is likened to sexual intercourse. Lust conceives and a hideous baby named SIN is born. Which is another way of saying that if we think about a forbidden act long enough, we will eventually do it. The whole process of lust conceiving and bringing forth sin is vividly illustrated in the incident of David and Bathsheba (2 Sam. 11:1–27).  And sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death, says James. Sin is not a barren, sterile thing; it produces a brood of its own.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE WORD OF GOD (1:18–27)<br />
</strong>James has been speaking of God as the Father of lights. Now he reminds us that He is our Father also, and that He has given us a unique role in His vast creation. We can fulfill that role by obedience to the word of truth.  The rest of this chapter gives practical instructions as to how we can be firstfruits of His creatures. It sets forth the practical righteousness which should characterize those who have been born again by the Word of Truth. We know that we were begotten by the word in order to manifest the truth of God. So then, let us now discharge our responsibility.<br />
 <br />
It is not enough to receive the implanted word; we must obey it. There is no virtue in possessing the Bible or even in reading it as literature. There must be a deep desire to hear God speaking to us and an unquestioning willingness to do whatever He says. We must translate the Bible into action. The word must become flesh in our lives. There should never be a time when we go to the Scriptures without allowing them to change our lives for the better. To profess great love for God’s word or even to pose as a Bible student is a form of self-deception unless our increasing knowledge of the word is producing increasing likeness to the Lord Jesus. To go on gaining an intellectual knowledge of the Bible without obeying it can be a trap instead of a blessing.<br />
 <br />
<strong>CONDEMNATION OF PARTIALITY (2:1–13)<br />
</strong>The first half of chapter 2 denounces the practice of showing respect of persons. Favoritism is utterly foreign to the example of the Lord or to the teachings of the NT. There is no place in Christianity for snobbishness or discrimination.  To show partiality is a violation of the royal law. It is both sin and transgression. Sin is any lack of conformity to the will of God, a failure to meet His standards. Transgression is the breaking of a known law. Certain acts are sinful because they are basically and inherently wrong, but they become transgressions when there is a specific law which forbids them. Partiality is sinful because it is essentially wrong in itself. But it is also transgression because there is a law against it.<br />
 <br />
<strong>FAITH AND WORKS (2:14–26)<br />
</strong>These verses are perhaps the most controversial in James’ Letter.  The section might actually be entitled “Justification by Works,” because there is a sense in which we are justified by works. In fact, in order to grasp the full truth of justification, we should clearly understand that there are six aspects of justification. We are justified by grace (Rom. 3:24). This simply means that we do not deserve to be justified; in fact, we deserve the very opposite. We are justified by faith (Rom. 5:1). Faith is the human response to God’s grace. By faith, we accept the free gift. Faith is that which appropriates what God has done for us. We are justified by blood (Rom. 5:9). Here blood is the price which had to be paid in order to procure our justification. The debt of sin was met by the precious blood of Christ, and now God can justify ungodly sinners because a righteous satisfaction has been made. We are justified by God (Rom. 8:33). The truth here is that God is the Person who justifies. We are justified by power (Rom. 4:25). Our justification is linked to the power that raised Christ from the dead. His resurrection proves that God is satisfied. And we are justified by works (Jas. 2:24). Works are the outward proof of the reality of our faith. They give outward expression to what would otherwise be invisible. From this we see that the person is justified by grace, by faith, by blood, by God, by power, and by works. Yet there is no contradiction at all. These statements simply present different aspects of the same truth. Grace is the principle upon which God justifies; faith is the means by which man receives it; blood is the price which the Savior had to pay; God is the active Agent in justification; power is the proof; and works are the result.</p>
<p> <br />
What James is emphasizing is that we are not saved by a faith of words only but by that kind of faith which results in a life of good works. In other words, works are not the root of salvation but the fruit; they are not the cause but the effect. Calvin put it tersely: “We are saved by faith alone, but not by a faith that is alone.”  True faith and good works are inseparable.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE TONGUE: ITS USE AND ABUSE (3:1–12)<br />
</strong>Just as an old-fashioned doctor examined a patient’s tongue to assist in diagnosis, so James tests a person’s spiritual health by his or her conversation. Self-diagnosis begins with sins of speech.  We are all prone to stumble in many areas but if anyone can control his tongue, so that he does not commit the various sins of speech, that person is truly well-rounded and well-disciplined. If one can exercise control in speech, he should not have difficulty in practicing self-control in other areas of life as well.<br />
 <br />
It is inconsistent to use the tongue for both good and evil purposes. It is completely unnatural; there is nothing like it in nature. One minute a man blesses God with his tongue, the next he curses those who are made in the image of God. How incongruous that a common source should ever produce such opposite results! Such a state of affairs should not exist. The tongue that blesses God should help men instead of wounding them. All that we say should be subject to the threefold test: Is it true? Is it kind? Is it necessary? Constantly we should ask the Lord to set a watch before our lips (Ps. 141:3), and pray that the words of our mouths and the meditations of our hearts might be acceptable in the sight of Him who is our strength and Redeemer (Ps. 19:14). We should remember that our members in Romans 12:1 include our tongue.  No spring gives fresh water and bitter at the same time. The tongue should not do so either. Its outflow should be uniformly good.</p>
<p><strong>WISDOM: THE TRUE AND THE FALSE (3:13–18)<br />
</strong>James now discusses the difference between true wisdom and false. When he speaks about wisdom, he is not thinking of how much knowledge a man has, but how he lives his life from day to day. It is not the possession of knowledge but the proper application of it that counts. We have here a portrait of the truly wise man. Basically, this man is the Lord Jesus Christ; He is wisdom incarnate (Matt. 11:19; 1 Cor. 1:30). But also the wise person is one who manifests the life of Christ, one in whom the fruit of the Spirit is evident (Gal. 5:22, 23).</p>
<p>We have also a portrait of the worldly-wise man. He acts according to the principles of this world. He embodies all the traits that men glorify. His behavior gives no evidence of divine life within.</p>
<p>The man who is truly wise is genuinely humble. He estimates others to be better than himself. He does not put on airs, but does put others at ease right away. His behavior is not like that of the world around him; it is otherworldly. He does not live for the body but for the spirit. In words and deeds, he makes you think of the Lord Jesus. His life is pure. Morally and spiritually he is clean. Then too he is peaceable. He will endure insult and false accusation but will not fight back or even seek to justify himself. He is gentle, mild-mannered, and tenderhearted. And he is easy to reason with, willing to try to see the other person’s viewpoint. He is not vindictive but always ready to forgive those who have wronged him. Not only so but he habitually shows kindness to others, especially to those who don’t deserve it. And he is the same to all; he doesn’t play favorites. The rich receive the same treatment as the poor; the great are not preferred above the common people. Finally, he is not a hypocrite. He doesn’t say one thing and mean another. You will never hear him flatter. He speaks the truth and never wears a mask.</p>
<p>The worldly-wise man is not so. His heart is filled with envy and strife. In his determination to enrich himself, he becomes intolerant of every rival or competitor. There is nothing noble about his behavior; it rises no higher than this earth. He lives to gratify his natural appetites—just as the animals do. And his methods are cruel, treacherous, and devilish. Beneath his well-pressed suit is a life of impurity. His thought life is polluted, his morals debased, his speech unclean. He is quarrelsome with all who disagree with him or who cross him in any way. At home, at work, in social life, he is constantly contentious. And he is harsh and overbearing, rude and crude. People cannot approach him easily; he keeps them at arm’s length. To reason with him quietly is all but impossible. His mind is already made up, and his opinions are not subject to change. He is unforgiving and vindictive. When he catches someone in a fault or error, he shows no mercy. Rather he unleashes a torrent of abuse, discourtesy, and meanness. He values people according to the benefit they might be to him. When he can no longer “use” them, that is, when there is no further hope of profit from knowing them, he loses interest in them. Finally, he is two-faced and insincere. You can never be sure of him—either of his words or actions.</p>
<p><strong>COVETOUSNESS: ITS CAUSE AND CURE (Chap. 4)<br />
</strong>James has pointed out that the wise man is a peace-loving man. Now he is reminded of the tragic strife that often exists among God’s people. What is the cause of it all? Why are there so many unhappy homes and so many churches torn by division? Why are there such bitter feuds among Christian workers in the homeland, and such conflicts among missionaries abroad? The reason is that we are ceaselessly striving to satisfy our lust for pleasures and possessions, and to outdo others.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that there are wars and fights among Christians. To suggest that this paragraph does not apply to believers is unrealistic, and it robs the passage of all its value for us. What causes all this fighting? It arises from the strong desires within us which are constantly struggling to be satisfied. There is the lust to accumulate material possessions. There is the drive for prestige. There is the craving for pleasure, for the gratification of bodily appetites. These powerful forces are at work within us. We are never satisfied. We always want more. And yet it seems we are constantly frustrated in our desire to get what we want. The unfulfilled longing becomes so powerful that we trample on those who seem to obstruct our progress.</p>
<p>In verses 7–10, we find six steps to be followed where there is true repentance against the sins of the saints. His words have pierced our hearts like arrows of conviction. They have fallen like thunderbolts from the throne of God. We realize that God has been speaking to us. Our hearts have been bowed beneath the influence of His word. But the question now is, “What shall we do?”</p>
<p>The first thing to do is to submit to God. This means that we must be subject to Him, ready to listen to Him and obey Him. <br />
 <br />
Next we should actively resist the devil.  Take a stand against unholy desires, motives, thoughts, and actions.</p>
<p>Next we should draw near to God. We do this by prayer. We must come before Him in desperate, believing prayer, telling Him all that is on our heart. As we thus approach Him, we find that He will draw near to us.<br />
 <br />
The fourth step is: Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Hands speak of our actions and hearts represent our motives and desires. We cleanse our hands and purify our hearts through confession and forsaking sins, both outward and inward. </p>
<p>Confession should be accompanied by deep sorrow for sin. Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. When God visits us in conviction of sin, it is not time for levity. Rather it is a time when we should prostrate ourselves before Him and mourn over our sinfulness, powerlessness, coldness, and barrenness.</p>
<p>Finally, we should humble ourselves in the sight of the Lord. If we honestly take our place in the dust at His feet, He will lift us up in due time.</p>
<p>The next sin which James denounces is self-confident, boastful planning in independence of God (vv. 13–16). He pictures a businessman who has a complete plan laid out for the future. Notice the details. He thought about the time (today or tomorrow); the personnel (we); the place (such and such a city); the duration (spend a year there); the activity (buy and sell); and the anticipated result (make a profit). What is missing in this picture? He never once takes God into his business. In life, it is necessary to make some plans for the future, but to do so in self-will is sinful. To say “we will” or “I will” is the essence of sin. Note for instance, the ”I wills” of Lucifer in Isaiah 14:13, 14: “For you have said in your heart: ‘I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God; I will also sit on the mount of the congregation on the farthest sides of the north; I will ascend above the heights of the clouds, I will be like the Most High.’.”</p>
<p><strong>THE RICH AND THEIR COMING REMORSE (5:1–6)<br />
</strong>In one of the most searching and piercing sections of his Letter, James now launches into a denunciation of the sins of the rich. The words fall like hammer-blows, blunt and unsparing. In fact, the denunciation is so strong that these verses are seldom preached on.  James is here seen in the role of a prophet of social justice. He cries out against the failure of the rich to use their money for the alleviation of human need. He condemns those who have become rich by exploiting their workers. He rebukes their use of wealth for self-indulgence and luxurious living. Finally, he pictures the rich as arrogant oppressors of the righteous.  The Bible never says that it is a sin to be rich. A person, for instance, may inherit a fortune overnight and certainly he has not committed any sin in thus becoming rich. But the Bible does teach that it is wrong to hoard riches. The Lord Jesus expressly forbade the hoarding of wealth. He said, “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also” (Matt. 6:19–21).</p>
<p><strong>EXHORTATION TO PATIENCE (5:7–12)<br />
</strong>James now turns to believers who were being oppressed, and encourages them to be patient. The motive for patience is the coming of the Lord. This may refer either to the Rapture or to Christ’s coming to reign. Both are used in the NT as incentives to patient endurance.  The wrongs of earth will be made right when the Lord returns. Therefore His people should be patient, like the farmer. Their hearts should be established with the certainty of His coming.<br />
 <br />
<strong>PRAYER AND THE HEALING OF THE SICK (5:13–20)<br />
</strong>The theme of the closing verses of the Epistle is prayer. The word occurs seven times, either as a noun or verb.  In every circumstance of life, we should go to the Lord in prayer. When in trouble, we should approach Him with earnest entreaties. In times of rejoicing, we should lift our hearts to Him in praise. He wants to be brought into all the changing moods of our lives.</p>
<h6>1. Christians agree that all sickness is, in a general way, the result of sin in the world. If sin had never entered, there would be no sickness.<br />
2. Sometimes sickness is a direct result of sin in a person’s life. In 1 Corinthians 11:30, we read of certain Corinthians who were sick because they participated in the Lord’s Supper without judging sin in their lives, that is, without confessing and forsaking it.<br />
3. Not all sickness is a direct result of sin in a person’s life. Job was sick in spite of the fact that he was a most righteous man (Job 1:8). The man born blind was not suffering for sins he had committed (John 9:2, 3). Epaphroditus was sick because of his tireless activity in the work of the Lord (Phil. 2:30). Gaius was spiritually healthy but apparently physically unwell (3 Jn. v. 2).<br />
4. Sometimes sickness is a result of satanic activity. It was Satan who caused Job’s body to be covered with boils (Job 2:7). It was Satan who crippled the woman in Luke 13:10–17 so that she was bent double, unable to straighten herself up: “This woman &#8230; whom Satan has bound—think of it—for eighteen years” (13:16). Paul had a physical infirmity caused by Satan. He called it “a thorn in the flesh &#8230; a messenger of Satan to buffet me” (2 Cor. 12:7).<br />
5. God can and does heal. In a very real sense, all healing is divine. One of the names of God in the OT is Jehovah-Ropheka—“the LORD who heals you” (Ex. 15:26). We should acknowledge God in every case of healing.<br />
It is clear from the Bible that God uses different means in healing. Sometimes He heals through natural bodily processes. Sometimes He heals through medicines. Sometimes He heals through “deliverance from underlying fears, resentments, self-preoccupation, and guilts, all of which produce illness.” Sometimes He heals through physicians and surgeons.<br />
6. But God also heals miraculously. The Gospels contain many illustrations of this. There is nothing in the Bible to discourage us from believing that God can heal miraculously today.<br />
7. Yet we must also be clear that it is not always God’s will to heal. Paul left Trophimus sick at Miletus (2 Tim. 4:20). The Lord did not heal Paul of his thorn in the flesh (2 Cor. 12:7–10). If it were always God’s will to heal, some would never grow old or die!<br />
8. God has not promised to heal in every case; therefore, healing is not something we can demand from Him. In Philippians 2:27, healing is spoken of as a mercy, not something which we have a right to expect.<br />
9. While it is true in a general sense that healing is in the “Atonement,” yet not all the blessings that are in the Atonement have been given to us yet. For instance, the redemption of the body was included in Christ’s work for us, but we will not receive it until Christ comes for His saints (Rom. 8:23). At that time also we will be completely and finally healed of all diseases.<br />
10. It is not true that failure to be healed indicates a lack of faith. If it were, this would mean that some would live on indefinitely; but no one does. Paul, Trophimus, and Gaius were not healed, and yet their faith was virile and active.<br />
 <br />
LESSON 49 – Book Of 1st Peter Lesson 1</h6>
<p>Christians in Muslim and Marxist countries are so used to repression, hostility, and even downright persecution that they almost come to expect it. For them 1 Peter is a tremendous practical help in accepting suffering as allowed by the Lord and as beneficial in producing certain desirable qualities, such as perseverance.  Christians in the West, especially English-speaking believers with their great biblical heritage, have not yet adjusted to public opposition to the faith. Until recently the state at least smiled on the family unit as basic to society and even encouraged attendance at “the church of your choice.” No longer. The government, especially local government, seems to use its judges, educational institutions, and especially the media, to misrepresent, ridicule, and even defame Bible-believing Christians. Radio, television, films, newspapers, magazines, and official communiqués promote immorality, cheating, and even blasphemy. Christianity is now “counter-culture,” and the sooner believers learn the lessons the Apostle Peter teaches in his First Letter, the more prepared they will be for the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>As has been noted, Peter is especially dealing with suffering in the Christian life. So far his readers seem to have undergone slander and ridicule for Christ (4:14, 15). Prison, confiscation of property, and violent death for many still apparently lay in the future. Suffering is not the only theme of this great Letter, however. The blessings inherited by accepting the gospel, the proper relationships of believers with the world, the state, the family, and the church, and instruction on elders and discipline are all included.<br />
 <br />
Peter’s teaching that government is generally helpful to those who wish to do right (1 Pet. 2:13-17) is thought by many to be too conciliatory to have been written after the start of Nero’s fierce persecution of the Christians (A.D. 64). At any rate, the Letter cannot be very far removed from this period in time, probably 64 or 65.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE BELIEVER’S PRIVILEGES AND DUTIES (1:1–2:10)<br />
The Believers Uniqueness (1:3-12)<br />
</strong>In verses 3–12, Peter sets forth the unique glories of our salvation. It is by God’s abundant mercy that we have been born anew to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. God is the source of this salvation. His great mercy is its cause. The new birth is the nature of it. A living hope is its present reward. The resurrection of Jesus Christ is the righteous basis of our salvation, as well as the foundation of our living hope.</p>
<p><strong>His Conduct in the Light of His Position (1:13–2:3)<br />
</strong>Beginning here, there is a change in emphasis. Peter has been dealing with the glories of our salvation. At this point, he launches into a series of exhortations based on the foregoing.<br />
 <br />
First, Peter urges the saints to have a “girded” mind. The girding up of the mind is an interesting figure of speech. In eastern lands, people wore long, flowing robes. When they wanted to walk fast or with a minimum of hindrance, they would tie the robe up around their waist with a belt (see Ex. 12:11). In this way they girded up their loins. But what does Peter mean by gird up the loins of your mind? As they went out into a hostile world, believers were to avoid panic and distraction. In times of persecution, there is always the tendency to become rattled and confused. A girded mind is one that is strong, composed, cool, and ready for action. It is unimpeded by the distraction of human fear or persecution.</p>
<p>This state of mental solidarity is further encouraged by the words be sober. This means self-control in contrast to hysteria. The sober spirit is poised and stable.<br />
Next, the saints are urged to have the optimistic, forward-looking mind: rest your hope fully upon the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. The assurance of Christ’s Return is held out as a compelling motive for endurance through the storms and tribulations of life.<br />
 <br />
Because they are partakers of the divine life, Christians should put away once for all the following unloving acts:<br />
Malice—the harboring of evil thoughts against another person.<br />
Deceit—any form of dishonesty and trickery.<br />
Hypocrisy—insincerity, pretense, sham.<br />
Envy—bare-faced jealousy.<br />
Evil speaking—backbiting, malicious gossip, recrimination.</p>
<p>A second obligation flowing from our new birth is to have an insatiable craving for the pure spiritual milk of the word. The sins mentioned in the previous verse stunt spiritual growth; the good word of God nourishes it.<br />
 <br />
His Privileges in the New House and Priesthood (2:4–10)<br />
Now Peter moves from exhortation to a consideration of believers’ privileges in the new house (the church) and in the new priesthood.<br />
 <br />
In the new dispensation, all believers are priests with instant access to the Throne Room of the universe, day or night. Their function is to offer up spiritual sacrifices (in contrast to the animal, bird, and meal offerings of the Mosaic Law). The spiritual sacrifices of the NT priest are:<br />
1. The presentation of the body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. This is an act of spiritual worship (Rom. 12:1).<br />
2. The sacrifice of praise. “That is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name” (Heb. 13:15).<br />
3. The sacrifice of good works. “Do not forget to do good. &#8230; ” This sacrifice is pleasing to God (Heb. 13:16).<br />
4. The sacrifice of possessions, or pocketbook. “Do not forget &#8230; to share.” This sacrifice also is pleasing to the Lord (Heb. 13:16).<br />
5. The sacrifice of service. Paul speaks of his ministry to the Gentiles as a priestly offering (Rom. 15:16).<br />
 <br />
The priesthood of all believers is a truth that should be understood, believed, and joyfully practiced by every Christian. At the same time, it must not be abused. Though all believers are priests, not every priest has the right to preach or teach in the assembly. There are certain controls which must be observed.<br />
1. Women are forbidden to teach or to have authority over men. (1 Tim. 2:12).<br />
2. Men who speak should do so as the oracles of God (1 Pet. 4:11). That means they should have a distinct assurance that they are speaking the words which God would have them speak on that particular occasion.<br />
3. All believers have some gift, just as every member of the human body has some function (Rom. 12:6; 1 Cor. 12:7). But not all gifts involve public speaking. Not all have the special service gifts of evangelist, pastor, or teacher (Eph. 4:11).<br />
4. A young man should rekindle the gift of God that is within him (2 Tim. 1:6). If that gift involves preaching, teaching, or some other form of public speaking, he should be given opportunity to exercise it in the assembly.<br />
5. The priesthood of believers is seen in operation in 1 Corinthians 14:26: “How is it then brethren? Whenever you come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.”<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE BELIEVER’S RELATIONSHIPS (2:11–4:6)<br />
As a Pilgrim in Relation to the World (2:11, 12)<br />
</strong>Most of the rest of 1 Peter concerns the conduct that should characterize the Christian in the various relationships of life. Peter reminds believers that they are sojourners and pilgrims in the world and that this fact should leave its stamp on all their behavior. They are sojourners in the sense that they are living in a foreign country where they do not have the rights of citizens. They are pilgrims in the sense that they are obliged to live for a while in a place which is not their permanent home.</p>
<p><strong>As a Citizen in Relation to Government (2:13–17)<br />
</strong>The next five verses deal with the Christian’s relation toward government. There is a time when obedience is not required. If a human government orders a believer to act contrary to the revealed will of God, then the believer must disobey the government. In that case he has a higher responsibility; he should obey God rather than men (Acts 5:29). If punishment is meted out for his disobedience, he should endure it courageously.</p>
<p>God’s will is that His people should live so honorably that the unconverted will have no legitimate basis for accusation. By lives of exemplary conduct, Christians can and should expose the ignorance of the charges made against Christianity by foolish men. Generally speaking, the Christian can live under any form of government. The only time he should disobey is when he is ordered to compromise his loyalty or obedience to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>As a Wife in Relation to Her Husband (3:1–6)<br />
</strong>Peter has stressed the obligation of Christians to submit to human government and to earthly masters. He now takes up the submission of wives to their husbands.  Every wife is to be submissive to her husband, whether he is a believer or not. God has given to the man the place of headship, and it is His will that the woman should acknowledge the authority of the man. The relationship between husband and wife is a picture of that between Christ and the church. The woman should obey her husband just as the church should obey Christ.  They should do good and let nothing terrify them. This means that a Christian wife should fill her God-appointed role as an obedient helpmate, and not be terrified even if she must suffer the unreasonable conduct of an unbelieving husband, except, of course, when it be comes violent or life-threatening.</p>
<p><strong>As a Husband in Relation to His Wife (3:7)<br />
</strong>Now the apostle turns to husbands and shows the corresponding duties they must fulfill. They should live considerately with their wives, showing love, courtesy, and understanding. They should bestow the tender regard on their wives that is appropriate for members of the weaker sex.  A man’s attitude toward his wife should recognize the fact that she is a fellow heir of the grace of life. This refers to a marriage in which both are believers. Though weaker than the man in some ways, the woman enjoys equal standing before God and shares equally the gift of everlasting life.<br />
 <br />
<strong>As a Sufferer in Relation to Persecutors (3:9–4:6)<br />
</strong>This whole Epistle is written against a backdrop of persecution and suffering. From this verse to 4:6 the subject is the Christian and his relation to persecutors. Repeatedly, believers are urged to suffer for righteousness’ sake without retaliating. We are not to repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling. Instead we are to bless those who mistreat us, and to repay insult with kindness. As Christians, we are not called to harm others but to do them good, not to curse but to bless. Then God rewards this type of behavior with a blessing.</p>
<p>The worst that the foe can do to a Christian does not give eternal harm. The enemy can injure his body but he cannot damage his soul.  During World War II a Christian boy of twelve refused to join a certain movement in Europe. “Don’t you know that we have power to kill you?” they said. “Don’t you know,” he replied quietly, “that I have power to die for Christ!” He had the conviction that no one was able to harm him.</p>
<p>We have been considering Christ as an example of One who suffered unjustly. He suffered at the hands of wicked men for the cause of righteousness. Since this was so, His followers should arm themselves with the same mind. They should expect to suffer for His name. They should be prepared to endure persecution because they are Christians.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE BELIEVER’S SERVICE AND SUFFERING (4:7–5:14)<br />
Urgent Imperatives for the Last Days (4:7–11)<br />
</strong>The first admonition is to be serious and watchful in your prayers. This was written in a time of persecution and means that the believer’s prayer life should be free from the distractions of panic and emotional instability brought on by stress: his fellowship with God should be undisturbed by discordant circumstances.</p>
<p>He must pay attention to his fellowship with other believers (vv. 8, 9), and have fervent love for all members of the household of faith.  The statement “love will cover a multitude of sins” (Prov. 10:12) should not be taken as a doctrinal explanation of how sins are put away. The guilt and penalty of sins can only be removed by the blood of Christ. Neither should the statement be used to condone sin or to relieve an assembly from its responsibility to discipline an offender. It means that true love is able to overlook minor faults and failures in other believers.</p>
<p>One means of demonstrating love to the brethren is by practicing hospitality ungrudgingly. This counsel is especially needed during times of persecution when food supplies might be running low and when those who harbor Christians are subject to arrest and imprisonment, if not death itself.</p>
<p>Each believer has received a gift from the Lord, some special function to perform as a member of the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 12:4–11, 29–31; Rom. 12:6–8). These gifts are a stewardship from God. They are not to be used for selfish gain but for His glory and for the good of others. We are not meant to be the terminals of God’s gifts to us; His grace reaches us but should not end with us. We are intended to be channels through whom the blessing can flow to others.<br />
 <br />
Even if a man is gifted to preach or teach, he must be sure that the words he speaks are the very words God would have him say on that particular occasion. This is what is meant by the oracles of God. It is not enough for a man simply to preach from the Bible. He should also have the assurance that he is presenting the particular message intended by God for that audience at that time.</p>
<p><strong>Exhortations and Explanations Concerning Suffering (4:12–19)<br />
</strong>The rest of chapter 4 contains exhortations and explanations concerning suffering incurred for the name of Christ. The word “suffering” and its derivatives are used twenty-one times in this Epistle.<br />
The natural attitude for a Christian is to look on persecution as strange and abnormal. We are surprised when we have to suffer. But Peter tells us that we should consider it as normal Christian experience. We have no right to expect better treatment from the world than our Savior received. All who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted (2 Tim. 3:12). It is especially true that those who take a forthright stand for Christ become the object of savage attack. Satan doesn’t waste his ammunition on nominal Christians. He turns his big guns on those who are storming the gates of Hades.</p>
<p>The early Christians rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ (Acts 5:41). So should every Christian who has the privilege of being reviled for Christ’s sake. Such suffering is a true indication that the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Exhortations and Salutations (5:1–14)<br />
</strong>This final chapter of 1 Peter contains exhortations and greetings. First there is a word for the elders. By way of authority for delivering such a charge, Peter introduces himself as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the impending glory. Fellow elder—what a far cry from claiming to be “supreme pontiff” of the church</p>
<p>Elders are mature men of Christian character who are qualified by the Holy Spirit to provide spiritual leadership in the assembly. The NT presupposes a plurality of elders—not one elder over a church or over a group of churches, but two or more elders in one assembly (Phil. 1:1). For the qualifications of elders see 1 Timothy 3:1–7 and Titus 1:6–9.</p>
<p>Although we should not worry, we must be sober and vigilant, because we have a powerful adversary, the devil. To be sober means to be serious-minded, to take a realistic approach to life, to be intelligent concerning the stratagems of Satan.  An individual who takes no cognizance of the nature or character of the world, one who is unmindful of the purposes and attacks of our adversary, the Devil, can afford to live in a lighthearted or flippant way. But for one who sees life as Jesus Christ sees it, there must be an entirely new attitude, an entirely new outlook characterized by sobriety. </p>
<p>There must also be constant vigilance, a preparedness to meet every attack of the wicked one. Here the adversary is described as a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. The devil has different poses. Sometimes he comes like a snake, seeking to lure people into moral corruption. Sometimes he disguises himself as an angel of light, attempting to deceive people in the spiritual realm. Here, as a roaring lion, he is bent on terrorizing God’s people through persecution.</p>
<p>God uses suffering to educate us and mold our Christian character. He is training us for reigning. Four aspects of this training process are listed.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect—</strong>Trials make the believer fit; they supply needed elements in his character to make him spiritually mature. Establish—Suffering makes Christians more stable, able to maintain a good confession, and to bear up under pressure. This is the same word the Lord Jesus used with Peter: “ . . .strengthen [or establish] your brethren” (Luke 22:32). Strengthen—Persecution is intended by Satan to weaken and wear out believers, but it has the opposite effect. It strengthens them to endure. Settle—This verb is related to the word “foundation” in the original. God wants every believer to be firmly planted in a secure place in His Son and in His word.</p>
<p>The elder closes with a charge and a benediction. The charge is, “Greet one another with a kiss of love.” The obligation of brotherly love is a standing order for the church, though the manner of expressing it may vary in cultures and times.</p>
<p>The benediction is: “Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus.” It is a tranquil word to use with storm-tossed saints, who are enduring affliction for the name of Christ. Jesus whispers peace to His blood-bought flock as they suffer for Him in the midst of a turbulent society.</p>
<h6>LESSON 50 – Book Of 2nd Peter Lesson 1</h6>
<p>Amid the encroaching darkness of apostasy this short Letter is looking forward to our Lord’s Coming. It is personally reminiscent of Peter’s life and personality, yet breathes Christ to those who are struggling in dark times.  This Letter was written shortly before Peters death, which would put its’ date in either 66 or 67 A.D.</p>
<p>Two main strands twine together in this Letter:  the prophetic word (1:19–21) and libertinism (chap. 2). Already on the horizon Peter sees false teachers who will bring in “destructive heresies” that allow loose and licentious lifestyles. These are people who ridicule the idea of coming judgment (3:1–7). What is seen as future in Peter’s day is seen as having crept in by Jude’s Epistle (v. 4). When Christendom lost its love for Christ’s Coming and settled down in the world (under Constantine and following), the morals of the church went plummeting. The same is true today. The nineteenth century awakening of interest in prophetic truth is waning today in many circles—and the loose living in some churches shows that Peter was inspired to write much needed truth for the entire Christian era.</p>
<p><strong>CALL TO DEVELOP STRONG CHRISTIAN CHARACTER (1:3–21)<br />
</strong>This passage should be of immense interest to every Christian because it tells how we can keep from falling in this life and how we can be assured of a triumphal entry into the next.</p>
<p>First we are assured that God has made full provision for us to have a life of holiness. His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness. Just as His power saves us in the first place, so His power energizes us to live holy lives from then on. The order is—first life, then godliness.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Our calling is one of Peter’s favorite themes. He reminds us that:<br />
</strong>(1) We have been called out of darkness into His marvelous light (1 Pet. 2:9).<br />
(2) We have been called to follow Christ in a pathway of suffering (1 Pet. 2:21).<br />
(3) We have been called to return blessing for reviling (1 Pet. 3:9).<br />
(4) We have been called to his eternal glory (1 Pet. 5:10).<br />
(5) We have been called by glory and virtue (2 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p><strong>Think of some of the promises that relate to the life of holiness.</strong><br />
(1) Freedom from sin’s dominion (Rom. 6:14).<br />
(2) Grace that is sufficient (2 Cor. 12:9).<br />
(3) Power to obey His commands (Phil. 4:13).<br />
(4) Victory over the devil (Jas. 4:7).<br />
(5) Escape when tempted (1 Cor. 10:13).<br />
(6) Forgiveness when we confess our sins (1 Jn. 1:9)—and forgetfulness too (Jer. 31:34).<br />
(7) Response when we call (Ps. 50:15).</p>
<p>No wonder Peter says the promises of God are precious and very great! These promises enable the believer to escape the corruption that is in the world through lust. God has promised all that we need to resist temptation. When passionate cravings come, we can claim the promises. They enable us to escape from the world’s corruption—its sexual sin, its drunkenness, its filth, its misery, its treachery, and its strife.</p>
<p>Verses 3 and 4 show that God has given us all that is necessary for the divine life. Because He has, we must be diligent in cultivating it. God does not make us holy against our will or without our involvement. There must be desire, determination, and discipline on our part.</p>
<p>God calls every Christian to a life of discipline. Someone has defined this as the controlling power of the will under the operation of the Spirit of God. There must be discipline in prayer, discipline in Bible study, discipline in the use of time, discipline in curbing bodily appetites, discipline in sacrificial living.</p>
<p>Failure to persevere in the development of Christian character leads to barrenness, unfruitfulness, blindness, shortsightedness, and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Barrenness. Only the life lived in fellowship with God can be truly effective. The guidance of the Holy Spirit eliminates barren activity and insures maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>Unfruitfulness. It is possible to have considerable knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and yet to be unfruitful in that knowledge. Failure to practice what we know leads inevitably to barrenness. Inflow without outgo killed the Dead Sea, and it kills productivity in the spiritual realm as well.</p>
<p>Shortsightedness. There are various degrees of impaired vision which are spoken of as blindness. Shortsightedness here specifies the form of blindness in which man lives for the present rather than the future. He is so occupied with material things that he neglects the spiritual.</p>
<p>Forgetfulness. Finally, the man who lacks growth in virtue has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins. The truth of his redemption has lost its grip on him. He is going back in the direction from which he was once rescued. He is toying with sins that caused the death of God’s Son.</p>
<p>By manifesting the fruit of the Spirit, we can provide unmistakable evidence that we truly belong to Him. A holy life proves the reality of our salvation.</p>
<p>Living a holy life will keep us from stumbling. It is not a question of falling into eternal perdition; the work of Christ delivers us from that. Rather, it refers to falling into sin, disgrace, or disuse. If we fail to progress in divine things, we are in danger of wrecking our lives. But if we walk in the Spirit, we will be spared from being disqualified for His service.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE RISE OF FALSE TEACHERS PREDICTED (Chap. 2)<br />
</strong>At the close of chapter 1 Peter referred to the prophets of the OT as men who spoke, not by their own will, but as moved by the Holy Spirit. Now he mentions that in addition to the true prophets in the OT period, there were also false prophets. And just as there will be bona fide teachers in the Christian era, there will be false teachers as well.</p>
<p>These false teachers take their place inside the church. They pose as ministers of the gospel. This is what makes the peril so great. If they came right out and said they were atheists or agnostics, people would be on guard. But they are masters of deception. They carry the Bible and use orthodox expressions —though using them to mean something entirely different.  Where are these false teachers found? To mention just a few of the most obvious places:<br />
Liberal and Neo-Orthodox Protestantism<br />
Roman Catholicism<br />
Unitarianism and Universalism<br />
Russellism (Jehovah’s Witnesses)<br />
Mormonism<br />
Christian Science<br />
Unity School of Christianity<br />
 <br />
While professing to be ministers of righteousness, they secretly bring in soul-destroying heresies alongside true Bible doctrine. It is a deceptive mixture of the false and the true. Primarily, they peddle a system of denials. Here are some of the denials which can be found among certain of the groups listed above:<br />
They deny the verbal, plenary inspiration of the Bible,<br />
the Trinity,<br />
the deity of Christ,<br />
His virgin birth,<br />
His death as a Substitute for sinners<br />
the value of His shed blood<br />
His bodily resurrection,<br />
salvation by grace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ<br />
the reality of miracles in the Bible</p>
<p>Other false teachings common today are:<br />
The Kenosis theory—the heresy that Christ emptied Himself of all the attributes of deity. This means that He could sin, make mistakes, etc.<br />
The “God is dead” fantasy, evolution, universal salvation, purgatory.<br />
 <br />
Peter predicts that they will attract a large following. They do this by scuttling the biblical standards of morality and encouraging the indulgence of the flesh. Here are two examples:<br />
Anglican Bishop John A. T. Robinson wrote:<br />
&#8230; nothing can of itself always be labeled as “wrong.” One cannot, for instance, start from the position “sex relations before marriage” or “divorce” are wrong or sinful in themselves. They may be in 99 cases or even 100 cases out of 100, but they are not intrinsically so, for the only intrinsic evil is lack of love.</p>
<p>In the book Called to Responsible Freedom, published by the National Council of Churches, young people are counseled:<br />
In the personal, individual sense, then, what justifies and sanctifies sexuality is not the external marital status of the people before the law but rather what they feel toward each other in their hearts. Measured in such a way, holding hands can be very wrong indeed while intimate sex-play can be right and good.</p>
<p>False teachers are greedy, both in the sexual and financial realms. They have chosen the ministry as a lucrative profession. Their great aim is to build up a large following and thus to increase their income.  They exploit people with false words.  These men, with Bible in hand, pose as ministers of righteousness, give out well-known evangelical hymns, and use scriptural expressions. But all this is camouflage for heretical teachings and corrupt morals.</p>
<p>In verses 4–10, we have three OT examples of God’s judgment on apostasy—the angels, the antediluvians, and the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p>We assume that the angels who sinned are those also mentioned in Jude 6. There we learn that: (1) They did not keep their position. (2) They left their proper dwelling. Though we cannot be certain, there is strong reason to believe that these are the same as “the sons of God” mentioned in Genesis 6:2: “The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were beautiful; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose.” Angels are called sons of God in Job 1:6; 2:1. The inference in Genesis 6 is that these sons of God left the angelic position assigned to them, exchanged their dwelling in heaven for one on earth, and intermarried with human wives. The children born to them were nephilim, which means “fallen ones” (Gen. 6:4). It seems clear from Genesis 6:3 that God was extremely displeased with these abnormal sexual unions.<br />
 <br />
It is significant that liberal clergymen today are becoming increasingly outspoken in favor of sexual perversion. One official of the United Church of Christ, writing in Social Action, recommended that the church cease to discriminate against homosexuals in admission to seminaries, in ordination, and in employment on church staffs. Ninety Episcopal priests recently decided that homosexual acts between consenting adults are morally neutral. False religious teachers are in the forefront of movements to legalize this sin.</p>
<p>It is no accident that this Epistle, dealing with apostasy, should have so much to say about immorality; the two often go together. Apostasy often has its roots in moral failure. For instance, a man may fall into serious sexual sin. Instead of acknowledging his guilt and finding cleansing through the blood of Christ, he decides to cast off the knowledge of God, which condemns his actions, and live in practical atheism.</p>
<p>The greater a person’s privilege, the greater his responsibility. The more a person knows of Christian standards, the more obligated he is to live up to them. It would be better never to have known God’s holy requirements, than having known them to turn back to the filth of the world.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE RISE OF SCOFFERS PREDICTED (Chap. 3)<br />
</strong>From the subject of false teachers in chapter 2, Peter turns to the certain rise of scoffers in the last days. In this Letter as in the previous one, he first encourages his readers to cling to the Bible.  They should remember the predictions of the holy prophets—found in the OT; and they should remember the teaching of the Lord as conveyed through the apostles—this is preserved in the NT. The Bible is the only true safeguard in days of deception and abandonment of Christ.<br />
 <br />
The united testimony of the prophets and apostles was that scoffers would come in the last days, following their own lusts. Christians should remember this. They should not be bowled over by the arrogant and blasphemous denials of these men. Rather they should see in them a definite indication that the end of the age is nearing.  These mockers follow their own passions. Having rejected the knowledge of God, they fearlessly indulge their appetites. They advocate permissiveness with total disregard of any impending judgment.</p>
<p>3:4 Their primary scoff has to do with the coming of Christ. Their attitude is, “Where is the promise of His coming?” meaning, “Where is the fulfillment of the promise?”  What they really say is this: “You Christians have been threatening us with warnings about a terrible judgment upon the world. You tell us that God is going to intervene in history, punish the wicked, and destroy the earth. It’s all a pack of nonsense. We have nothing to fear. We can live as we please. There is no evidence that God ever has intervened in history; why should we believe that He ever will?”<br />
 <br />
Their conclusion is based on the careless hypothesis that “since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.” They say that nature invariably follows uniform laws, that there are no supernatural interventions, that there is a natural explanation for everything.  They believe in the law of uniformitarianism. This law states that existing processes in nature have always acted in the same manner and with essentially the same intensity as at present, and that these processes are sufficient to account for all the changes that have taken place.  There is a vital link between the law of uniformitarianism and the usual theories of evolution. The theory of the progressive development of living organisms from pre-existing types depends on the supposition that conditions have been fairly uniform.</p>
<p>The scoffers deliberately ignore one fact—the flood. God did intervene at one time in the affairs of men, and the specific purpose of His intervention was to punish wickedness. If it happened once, it can happen again.  It is a withering indictment of these men that they are willfully ignorant. They pride themselves on being knowledgeable. They profess to be objective in their reasoning. They boast that they adhere to the principles of scientific investigation. But the fact is that they deliberately ignore a well-attested fact of history—the deluge. They should take a course in geology!<br />
 <br />
God has promised to end the history of ungodly men with judgment. If there seems to be delay, it is not because God is unfaithful to His promise. It is because He is patient. He does not want any to perish. His desire is that all should come to repentance. He purposely extends the time of grace so that men might have every opportunity to be saved.  In Isaiah 61:2 we read of the year of the Lord’s favor and the day of His vengeance.  He waited 120 years before He sent the flood. Now He has waited several thousand years before destroying the world with fire.  But the day of the Lord will come. The day of the Lord refers to any period when God acts in judgment. It was used in the OT to describe any time when God punished evildoers and triumphed over His foes (Isa. 2:12; 13:6, 9; Ezek. 13:5; 30:3; Joel 1:15; 2:1, 11, 31; 3:14; Amos 5:18, 20; Obad. 15; Zeph. 1:7, 14; Zech. 14:1; Mal. 4:5).</p>
<p>Now Peter turns from the scoffers to the saints and presses home the obligations that devolve on them. Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness. To live for material things is to live for the temporary. Common sense tells us to turn from the tinsel and toys of this world and live in holiness and godliness. It is a simple matter of living for eternity rather than time, of emphasizing the spiritual rather than the material, of choosing the permanent over the passing.</p>
<p>Believers must be constantly on guard against the peril of error. The knowledge that there will always be false teachers who corrupt and imitate the truth should keep us alert. It is easy for the unsuspecting to be swept off their feet by the error of the wicked and to lose their spiritual balance.  Once again Peter teaches that continued progress in divine things is a great protection against the peril of false teachers. There must be a twofold growth—in grace and in knowledge. Grace is the practical demonstration of the fruit of the Spirit. Growth in grace is not increased head knowledge or tireless activity; it is increasing likeness to the Lord Jesus. Knowledge means acquaintance with the Lord through the word. Growth in knowledge means increasing study of and subjection to His words, works, and ways.</p>
<p>But Peter cannot close his Epistle with an exhortation to the saints. The climax must be glory to the Savior. And so we find the lovely doxology: To Him be the glory, both now and forever. Amen. This, after all, is the ultimate reason for our existence—to glorify Him—and therefore no concluding note to this Epistle could be more fitting.</p>
<h6>LESSON 51 – Book Of  1st John  Lesson 1</h6>
<p>John’s First Epistle is like a family photograph album. It describes those who are members of the family of God. Just as children resemble their parents, so God’s children have His likeness too. This Letter describes the similarities. When a person becomes a child of God, he receives the life of God—eternal life. All who have this life show it in very definite ways. For instance, they acknowledge Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, they love God, they love the children of God, they obey His commandments, and they do not go on sinning. These, then, are some of the hallmarks of eternal life. John wrote this Epistle so that all who have these family traits may know that they have eternal life (1 Jn.5:13).<br />
 <br />
Regarding the date that this letter was written (as well at the 2 immediately following it), a date late in the first century is accepted (A.D. 80–95). The fatherly tone of the Epistles goes well with the ancient tradition of the aged Apostle John being carried into the congregation and saying, “Little children, love one another.”</p>
<p>At the time John was writing, a false sect had arisen which became known as Gnosticism (Gk. gnōsis = knowledge). These Gnostics professed to be Christians but claimed to have additional knowledge, superior to what the apostles taught. They claimed that a person could not be completely fulfilled until he had been initiated into their deeper “truths.” Some taught that matter was evil, and that therefore the Man Jesus could not be God. They made a distinction between Jesus and “the Christ”.  “The Christ” was a divine emanation which came upon Jesus at His baptism and left before His death, perhaps in the Garden of Gethsemane. According to them, Jesus did die, but the Christ did not die.  In short, they denied the Incarnation, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Jesus Christ is both God and Man. John realized that these people were not true Christians, and so he warned his readers against them by showing that the Gnostics did not have the marks of true children of God.</p>
<p>According to John, a person either is a child of God or he is not; there is no in-between ground. That is why this Epistle is filled with such extreme opposites as light and darkness, love and hatred, truth and lie, death and life, God and the devil. At the same time, it should be noted that the apostle likes to describe people by their habitual behavior. In discerning between Christians and non-Christians, for instance, he does not base his conclusion on a single act of sin, but rather on what characterizes the person. Even a broken clock tells the correct time twice in every twenty-four hours! But a good clock tells the correct time regularly. So the general, day-by-day behavior of a Christian is holy and righteous, and by this he is known as a child of God. John uses the word “know” a great many times. The Gnostics professed to know the truth, but John here sets forth the true facts of the Christian Faith, which can be known with certainty. He describes God as light (1:5); love (4:8, 16); truth (5:6); and life (5:20). This does not mean that God is not a Person, but rather that God is the source of these four blessings. John also speaks of God as righteous (2:29; 3:7); pure (3:3); and sinless (3:5).</p>
<p><strong>PROLOGUE: THE CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP (1:1–4)<br />
</strong>The doctrinal foundation of all true fellowship is the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. There can be no true fellowship with those who hold false views concerning Him. The first two verses teach His eternity and the reality of His Incarnation. The same One who existed from all eternity with God the Father came down into this world as a real Man. The reality of His Incarnation is indicated by the fact that the apostles heard Him, saw Him with their eyes, gazed upon Him with deep meditation, and actually handled Him. The Word of life was not a mere passing illusion, but was a real Person in a body of flesh.</p>
<p>Verse two confirms that the One who was with the Father, and whom John calls that eternal life, became flesh and dwelt among us and was seen by the apostles.  The apostles did not keep this wonderful news as a secret, and neither should we. They realized that the basis of all fellowship is found here and so they declared it freely and fully.  They did not preach a philosophical gospel, but rather a PERSON with whom we can have a living, growing relationship.  All who receive the testimony of the apostles have fellowship with the Father, with His Son Jesus Christ, and also with the apostles and all other believers.<br />
 <br />
But why does John thus write concerning the subject of fellowship? The reason is that our joy may be full. John realized that the world is not capable of providing true and lasting joy for the human heart. This joy can only come through proper relationship with the Lord. When a person is in fellowship with God and with the Lord Jesus, he has a deep-seated joy that cannot be disturbed by earthly circumstances.  Note that this is not HAPPINESS, which is a mere emotion that can be changed by exterior circumstances; but rather JOY, which is immoveable.</p>
<p><strong>MEANS OF MAINTAINING FELLOWSHIP (1:5–2:2)<br />
</strong>Fellowship describes a situation where two or more persons share things in common. It is a communion or a partnership. John now undertakes to instruct his readers as to the requirements for fellowship with God.  “God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.”  By this He meant that God is absolutely holy, absolutely righteous, and absolutely pure. God cannot look with favor on any form of sin. Nothing is hidden with Him, but “all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account” (Heb. 4:13).</p>
<p>Now it follows that in order for a person to be in fellowship with God, there can be no hiding of sin. Light and darkness cannot exist in a person’s life at the same time, any more than they can exist together in the room of a home. If a man is walking in darkness, he is not in fellowship with God. A man who says he has fellowship with Him and habitually walks in darkness was never saved at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if one walks in the light, then he can have fellowship with the Lord Jesus and with his fellow Christians. As far as John is concerned in this passage, a man is either in the light or in darkness. If he is in the light, he is a member of God’s family. If he is in darkness, he does not have anything in common with God because there is no darkness in God at all. Those who walk in the light, that is, those who are Christians, have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ continually cleanses them from all sin.</p>
<p>Then again, fellowship with God requires that we acknowledge the truth concerning ourselves. For instance, to deny that we have a sinful nature means self-deception and untruthfulness. Notice that John makes a distinction between sin (v. 8) and sins (v. 9). Sin refers to our corrupt, evil nature. Sins refers to evils that we have done. Actually what we are is a lot worse than anything we have ever done. But, praise the Lord, Christ died for our sin and our sins.</p>
<p>In order for us to walk day by day in fellowship with God and with our fellow believers, we must confess our sins: sins of commission, sins of omission, sins of thought, sins of act, secret sins, and public sins. We must drag them out into the open before God, call them by their names, take sides with God against them, and forsake them. Yes, true confession involves forsaking of sins: “He who covers his sins will not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them will have mercy” (Prov. 28:13).  When we do that, we can claim the promise that God is faithful and just to forgive. He is faithful in the sense that He has promised to forgive and will abide by His promise. He is just to forgive because He has found a righteous basis for forgiveness in the substitutionary work of the Lord Jesus on the cross. And not only does He guarantee to forgive, but also to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to be in fellowship with God, we must not deny that we have committed acts of sin. God has stated over and over in His word that all have sinned. To deny this is to make God a liar. It is a flat contradiction of His word, and a complete denial of the reason the Lord Jesus came to suffer, bleed, and die.  Thus we see that fellowship with God does not require lives of sinlessness, but rather requires that all our sins should be brought out into His presence, confessed, and forsaken. It means that we must be absolutely honest about our condition, and that there should be no hypocrisy or hiding of what we really are.</p>
<p>John gives us God’s perfect standard for His people, and His gracious provision in the event of failure. The phrase “little children” refers to all the members of the family of God. God’s perfect standard is then set forth in the words “these things I write to you, that you may not sin.”  Because God is perfect, His standard for His people is absolute perfection. He would not be God if He said: “These things I write to you so that you sin just as little as you can.” God cannot condone sin in the least degree, and so He sets perfection before us as the goal. The Lord Jesus did this with the woman who was caught in the act of adultery; He said, “Neither do I condemn you, go and sin no more.”</p>
<p>At the same time, the Lord knows us, and so He has graciously made provision for us in the event of failure. This is expressed in the words, “if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” An advocate is one who comes to the side of another person in time of need in order to help. This is exactly what the Lord Jesus does for us when we sin. He immediately comes to us in order to restore us to fellowship with Himself.  There is something very wonderful in this verse which we should not overlook. It says, “And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father.” It does not say with God, but rather with the Father. He is still our Father even if we sin. This reminds us of the blessed truth that though sin in a believer’s life breaks fellowship, it does not break relationship. When a person is born again, he becomes a child of God. God is henceforth his Father, and nothing can ever affect that relationship. A birth is something that cannot be undone. A son may disgrace his father, but he is still a son by the fact of birth.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is not only our Advocate, but He is also the propitiation for our sins. This means that by dying for us, He freed us from the guilt of our sins and restored us to God by providing the needed satisfaction and by removing every barrier to fellowship. God can show mercy to us because Christ has satisfied the claims of justice. It is not often that an advocate (or lawyer) pays for his client’s crimes; yet that is what our Lord has done, and most remarkable of all, He paid for them by the sacrifice of Himself.<br />
 <br />
<strong>LESSON 52 – Book Of  1st John  Lesson 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>MARKS OF TRUE FELLOWSHIP: OBEDIENCE AND LOVE (2:3–11)</strong><br />
John is about to give the true marks of those who are in the Christian fellowship. The first is obedience. We can have assurance concerning our relationship with God if our life is characterized by a loving desire to do His will. These verses are doubtless aimed at the Gnostics who professed to have a superior knowledge of God, but who showed little interest in keeping the commandments of the Lord. John shows that such knowledge is hollow and worthless.</p>
<p>John describes the believer’s obedience in a threefold way—keeping His commandments (v. 3); keeping His word (v. 5); walking as He walked (v. 6). There is a definite progress in thought. To keep His commandments is to obey the teachings of the Lord Jesus as found in the NT. To keep His word means not only obedience to what is written, but a desire to do what we know would please Him. To walk as He walked is the full expression of God’s standard for His people; it means to live as Jesus lived.</p>
<p>John does not imply that the Christian life consists in faultless obedience to the will of God, but rather that the Christian habitually desires to keep His commandments and to do those things that are pleasing in His sight. John is looking at the over-all tenor of a person’s life. If someone says he knows God but does not keep His commandments, then it is clear that he is not telling the truth.<br />
 <br />
Another important mark of true believers is love for the brethren. John says that this is not a new commandment which he is writing, but an old commandment which they had had from the beginning. In other words, the Lord Jesus had taught His disciples to love one another from the very beginning of His earthly ministry.   The Gnostics were always parading their teachings as being new. But the apostle urges his readers to test everything by the teaching of the Lord Jesus when He was here on earth. There is always the danger of drifting away from that which was in the beginning. John says, “Get back to the beginning, and you will know what is true.”</p>
<p>In verses 9–11 we have the contrast between love that is false and that which is true. If one professes to be a Christian and yet hates those who are truly Christians, it is a sure sign that such a one is in darkness until now. This latter expression shows that it is not a case of backsliding that is in view. The man continues to be what he always was, namely, unsaved. On the other hand, the one who characteristically loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. This may mean that the man himself is not in danger of stumbling, or that he will not cause others to stumble. Either interpretation is true.</p>
<p><strong>STAGES OF GROWTH IN THE FELLOWSHIP (2:12–14)<br />
</strong>It is a wonderful thing to know, as a present possession, the complete remission of our sins. Notice, too, that our sins are forgiven for His name’s sake. It is for Christ’s sake that God forgives us our sins.</p>
<p>Fathers are described as those who have known the One who is from the beginning, mature believers who have known the sweet companionship of the Son of God and are satisfied with Him. Young men in the spiritual family are characterized by vigor and by combat. This is the period of conflict and of wrestling with the foe. Young men &#8230; overcome the wicked one because they have learned the secret of victory, namely, “Not I, but Christ living in me.” The little children are the babes in the faith. They do not know very much, perhaps, but they do know the Father.<br />
 <br />
<strong>TWO DANGERS TO THE FELLOWSHIP: THE WORLD AND FALSE TEACHERS (2:15–28)<br />
</strong>In verses 15–17, we have a strong warning against the world and all its false ways. Perhaps this is addressed primarily to the young men, for whom the world often holds a special attraction, but it is a warning that applies to all the Lord’s people. The world here is not the planet on which we live, or the natural creation about us. Rather it is the system which man has built up in an effort to make himself happy without Christ.  We are plainly warned not to love the world or the things that are in the world, for the simple reason that love for the world is not compatible with love for the Father. All that the world has to offer may be described as the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.</p>
<p>The lust of the flesh refers to such sensual bodily appetites as proceed from within our evil nature. The lust of the eyes applies to such evil desires as may arise from what we see. The pride of life is an unholy ambition for self-display and self-glory. These three elements of worldliness are illustrated in the sin of Eve. The tree was good for food; that is the lust of the flesh. The tree was pleasant to the eyes; that is the lust of the eyes. It was a tree to be desired to make one wise; this describes the pride of life.</p>
<p>As the devil is opposed to Christ, and the flesh is hostile to the Spirit, so the world is antagonistic to the Father. Appetite, avarice, and ambition are not of the Father, but of the world. That is, they do not proceed from the Father, but find their source in the world. Worldliness is the love for passing things. The human heart can never find satisfaction with things.</p>
<p>Another test of those who are in the Christian fellowship is the test of doctrine. The subject is introduced by a warning addressed to those who are babes in Christ against false teachers. Those who are young in the faith are especially susceptible to the lies of the Antichrist. John’s readers had been taught that an Antichrist would arise prior to the coming of Christ and pretend to be Christ. Just as coming events cast their shadow before them, so prior to the rise of the Antichrist, many antichrists appear. These are false teachers who offer a false christ and a false gospel. It is remarkable that the day in which we live is characterized by the existence of many Christ-denying cults, and these all bear testimony to the fact that the coming of the Savior is near.</p>
<p>These false teachers were professing Christians who once associated with the apostles. However, in heart they were not really one with true believers, and they showed this by going out from the fellowship. “If they had been of us, they would have continued with us.”  Here we learn that true faith always has the quality of permanence. If a man has really been born again, he will go on for the Lord. It does not mean that we are saved by enduring to the end, but rather that those who endure to the end are really saved. “The false teachers went out that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us.”</p>
<p>John did not write because his readers were ignorant of the truth, but rather to confirm them in the truth that they knew, and to remind them that no lie is of the truth. The Gnostics were teaching doctrines that were contrary to the word of God, and therefore they were lies. Their principal lie, the very basis of all their teaching, was their denial that Jesus is the Christ.  John is careful to point out that to deny the deity of the Lord Jesus is to deny the Father also. Some people like to believe that they worship God, but they do not want to have anything to do with the Lord Jesus Christ. The apostle says, “He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.”</p>
<p>In John 8:19, 42, Jesus said that those who failed to recognize His deity and to love Him neither knew the Father nor had Him as their Father. Similarly, John says, “Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.” Here we have the wonderful truth of the unity between the Father and the Son. You cannot have the Father unless you have the Son. This is a message which should be heeded by all Unitarians, Christian Scientists, Muslims, Modernists, Jehovah’s Witnesses, and Jews.</p>
<p>The safeguard for young believers against the false teachers is to stay close to the word of God. We should test everything by “What do the Scriptures say?” If a teaching does not agree with the Bible, then we should reject it also.  When we abide in the Biblical Christian doctrine, we give proof of the reality of our faith. </p>
<p><strong>MARKS OF THOSE IN THE CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP (CONT.): RIGHTEOUSNESS, LOVE, AND THE CONFIDENCE IT BRINGS (2:29–3:24)</strong><br />
Everyone who practices righteousness is born of God. Because God is righteous, it follows that all He does is righteous, and therefore everyone born of Him is righteous. This is John’s inescapable logic.  The thought of being born of God arrests John with wonder, and he calls on his readers to take a look at the wonderful love that brought us into the family of God. Love could have saved us without making us children of God. But the manner of God’s love is shown in that he brought us into His family as children. “Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!”</p>
<p>This does not mean that we will be physically like Jesus in heaven. The Lord Jesus will have His own definite appearance, and will bear the scars of Calvary throughout eternity. Each of us will have his own distinct features and will be recognizable as such. The Bible does not teach that everyone will look alike in heaven. However, we will be morally like the Lord Jesus Christ. We will be free from the possibility of defilement, sin, sickness, sorrow, and death.<br />
 <br />
A Christian cannot go on practicing sin, because that would be a complete denial of the purpose for which the Lord Jesus came into the world. He was manifested to take away our sins. To go on in sin, therefore, is to live in utter disregard of the reason for His Incarnation.  Again, a Christian cannot go on in sin because that would be a denial of the One whose name he bears. In Him there is no sin. This is one of the three key passages in the NT dealing with the sinless humanity of the Lord Jesus Christ. Peter tells us that “He did no sin.” Paul tells us that “He knew no sin.” Now John, the disciple who knew the Lord in an especially intimate way, adds his testimony, “In Him is no sin.”</p>
<p>“Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him, nor known Him.”  This verse contrasts the true believer with one who has never been born again. It can definitely be said of the true believer that he does not go on sinning. John is not here speaking about isolated acts of sin, but rather continued, habitual, characteristic behavior. This verse does not imply that when a Christian commits an act of sin, he loses his salvation. Rather it says that when a person sins habitually, it is conclusive that he was never regenerated.</p>
<p>The question naturally arises, “When does sin become habitual? How often does a person have to commit it for it to become characteristic behavior?” John does not answer this. Rather he puts each believer on guard, and leaves the burden of proof on the Christian himself.  Those who do not practice righteousness are not of God. There is no in-between ground. There are none who are half-and-half. God’s children are known by their righteous lives.</p>
<p>3:10b, 11 In this section we have a continuation of the second test of those who are in the family of God—the test of love. This is continued from 2:7–17. From the beginning of the Christian family, it has been taught that love to one’s brothers is a divine obligation. Love here is not used in the sense of friendliness or mere human affection, but it is divine love. It is loving others as Christ loved us. Actually, this cannot be done in one’s own personal strength, but only as empowered by the Holy Spirit.  It is a basic principle in human life that wickedness hates righteousness, and this explains why the world hates the believer. The righteous life of the Christian throws the wickedness of the unbeliever into sharp relief. The latter hates this exposure and instead of changing his wicked behavior, he seeks to destroy what shows it up so clearly.<br />
 <br />
By the exercise of real and active love to our brethren, we shall know that we are of the truth, and this will assure our hearts as we come before Him in prayer.  For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. The subject here is the attitude with which we come before God in prayer. This verse may be understood in two ways.  First of all, if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart in the sense that He is greater in compassion. While we may have intense feelings of unworthiness, yet God knows that basically we love Him and we love His people. He knows that we are His in spite of all our failures and sins.  The other view is that if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart in the matter of judgment. Whereas we only know our sins in a very limited way, God knows them fully and absolutely. He knows all that there is to blame in us, whereas we only know it in part.  Here is the attitude of one who has a clear conscience before God. It is not that this person has been living sinlessly, but rather that he has been quick to confess and forsake his sins. By doing this, he has confidence before God and boldness in prayer. Thus, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE NEED TO DISCERN BETWEEN TRUTH AND ERROR (4:1–6)<br />
</strong>Having mentioned the Holy Spirit, John is reminded that there are other spirits abroad in the world today, and that the children of God need to be warned against them. Thus he cautions the believer not to trust every spirit. The word spirit here probably refers primarily to teachers but not exclusively so. Just because a man speaks about the Bible, God, and Jesus does not mean that he is a true child of God. We are to test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world. These are people who profess to accept Christianity, but teach another gospel altogether.</p>
<p>John gives the actual tests by which these men are to be proven. The great test of a teacher is, “What do you think of Christ?” Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God. It is not so much the confession of the historical fact, namely that Jesus was born into the world in a human body, but rather it is the confession of a living Person, Jesus Christ come in the flesh. It is the confession that acknowledges Jesus as the Christ Incarnate. And confessing Him means bowing to Him as Lord of one’s life. Now if you ever hear a person presenting the Lord Jesus as the true Christ of God, you will know that he is speaking by the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God calls on men to acknowledge Jesus Christ as Lord and to commit their lives to Him. The Holy Spirit always glorifies Jesus.</p>
<p>And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. This is how you can detect the false teachers. They do not confess the Jesus who was described in the previous verse. This is the spirit of the Antichrist, which has been prophesied and which is now already in the world. There are many today who are willing to say acceptable things about Jesus, but they will not confess Him as God Incarnate. They will say that Christ is “divine,” but not that He is God.</p>
<p>Humble believers are able to overcome these false teachers because they have the Holy Spirit within them, and this enables them to detect error and to refuse to listen to it.</p>
<p>The false teachers are of the world and therefore, the source of all that they speak is the world. The world is the spring of all that they teach, and therefore the world hears them. This reminds us that the approval of the world is not a test as to the truthfulness of one’s teachings. If a man simply wants to be popular, all he needs to do is to speak as the world speaks, but if he is to be faithful to God, then he must face the disapproval of the world.<br />
In verse 6, John speaks as representing the apostles. He says, “We are of God. He who knows God hears us.” This means that all who are really born of God will accept the teaching of the apostles found in the NT. On the other hand, those who are not of God refuse the testimony of the NT, or they seek to add to or adulterate it.</p>
<p><strong>LESSON 53 – Book Of  1st John  Lesson 3</strong></p>
<p><strong>MARKS OF THOSE IN THE CHRISTIAN FELLOWSHIP (CONT.) (4:7–5:20)<br />
A. Love (4:7–21)<br />
</strong>Here John resumes the subject of love for one’s brother. He emphasizes that love is a duty, consistent with the character of God. As has been mentioned previously, John is not thinking of love that is common to all men, but of that love to the children of God which has been implanted in those who have been born again.</p>
<p>In the verses that follow, we have a description of the manifestation of God’s love in three tenses. In the past, it was manifested to us as sinners in the gift of His only begotten Son (4:9–11). In the present, it is manifested to us as saints in His dwelling in us (4:12–16). In the future, it will be manifested to us in giving us boldness in the day of judgment.<br />
 <br />
God’s love is manifested to us at the present time in dwelling in us. The apostle says, “No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us.”  Now God is manifested to the world, not through Christ, for He has gone back to heaven and is now at the right hand of God. Instead God is now manifested to the world through believers. How stupendous that now we must be God’s answer to man’s need to see Him!  God’s love is given to us, not that we might hoard it for ourselves, but that it might be poured out through us to others. When we do love one another in this way, that is proof that we are in Him, and He in us, and that we are partakers of His Spirit.<br />
 <br />
<strong>B. Sound Doctrine (5:1a)<br />
</strong>John now concludes the tests of life. Here he resumes the test of doctrine, or we might also call it the test of faith. In the first three verses, we are given the results of faith. These are, first, the divine birth, then love for God, then love for one’s fellow believers, and finally obedience to God’s commandments. First of all, then, we have the divine birth: Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. Belief here is not a mere intellectual assent to the fact, but rather a committal of one’s life to Jesus as the Christ.</p>
<p><strong>C. Love and the Obedience It Produces (5:1b–3)<br />
</strong>If we have been truly born of God, then we will love Him. And not only so, we will love His children as well. It is good to notice here that we are to love all believers, and not just those of a certain earthly communion or fellowship.<br />
The fourth result of faith is obedience to God’s commandments. By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep His commandments. Those who are truly saved will be characterized by a desire to do the will of God. Our love for God is expressed in willing obedience to His commands. The Lord Jesus said, “If you love Me, keep My commandments.”</p>
<p><strong>D. Faith that Overcomes the World (5:4, 5)<br />
</strong>Next we learn the secret of victory over the world. The world system is a monstrous scheme of temptation, always trying to drag us away from God and from what is eternal, and seeking to occupy us with what is temporary and sensual. People of the world are completely taken up with the things of time and sense. They have become the victims of passing things.</p>
<p>Only the man who is born of God really overcomes the world, because by faith he is able to rise above the perishing things of this world and to see things in their true, eternal perspective. Thus the one who really overcomes the world is not the great scientist or philosopher or psychologist, but the simple believer who realizes that the things which are seen are temporary and that the things which are not seen are eternal. A sight of the glory of God in the face of Jesus dims the glory of this world.<br />
 <br />
<strong>E. Sound Doctrine (5:6–12)<br />
</strong>It seems that the human heart is perpetually trying to rid itself of the doctrine of the atonement. Men would like to have the Lord Jesus as a perfect Man, the ideal Example, who has given us a marvelous code of morals. But John here insists that the Lord Jesus is not only Perfect Man, but Perfect God also, and that the same One who was baptized in the Jordan River gave His life as a sacrifice for sinners. Men say to Christ, “Come down from the cross and we will believe on You.” If they can just eliminate the cross from their thinking, they will be happy. But John says, “No. You cannot have the Lord Jesus Christ apart from His perfect redemptive work at Calvary.”</p>
<p>John now summarizes the Christian message: “This is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.” What tremendous truths these are, namely, that God has given eternal life to men, and that the source of this life is in His Son.   From this, the conclusion is inevitable. He who has the Son has life; and he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. The teaching is unmistakable. Eternal life is not found in education or philosophy or science or good works or religion or the church. To have life, one must have the Son of God. On the other hand, he who does not have the Son of God does not have life, that is, true life. Eternal life is inseparable from Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>F. Assurance Through the Word (5:13)<br />
</strong>We have now come to the concluding portion of the Epistle. First of all, John states in the clearest terms why he has written the preceding passages. The purpose is that those who believe in the name of the Son of God may know that they have eternal life. If you have the marks of those who are children of God, then you can know that you have been born into the family of God. This verse also teaches another precious truth, namely, that assurance of salvation comes through the word of God. John wrote these things so that people may know that they have eternal life. In other words, the Scriptures were written that those who believe on the Lord Jesus may have assurance that they are saved. There is no need of hoping or guessing or feeling or groping in the dark. It is not presumption for one to say that he is saved. John states in the clearest possible manner that those who truly believe in the Lord Jesus may know that they have eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>G. Confidence in Prayer (5:14–17)<br />
</strong>5:14, 15 When we know that we have eternal life, needless to say, we can go before the Lord with confidence. John describes this confidence in verses 14, 15. We know that if we ask anything according to God’s will, He hears those prayers and will answer them. Indeed we should fear to pray for anything that is not in accordance with His will. Perhaps someone will say, “But how can I know the will of God?” In a general way, the answer is that God’s will is revealed to us in the Sacred Scriptures, and so we should study the word in order that we might know better what God’s will is and how we can pray more intelligently.<br />
 <br />
<strong>H. Knowledge of Spiritual Realities (5:18–20)<br />
</strong>Beginning with verse 18, John brings his Epistle to a majestic close by reiterating the great certainties of the Christian Faith. We know that whoever is born of God does not sin. Of this we can be sure, that one who has the divine nature does not go on practicing sin. The reason follows: He who has been born of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him. As in 3:9, this refers to the true believer who perseveres or keeps himself through his divine nature. It is only such a person who remains unscathed by the wicked one.</p>
<p>The Christian answer to those who profess to have superior knowledge is this: We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one. With John, there is no mincing of words. He sees only two spheres—in Him or under the sway of the wicked one. All people are either saved or lost, and their position depends on their relationship to Jesus Christ. Hear this, you Gnostics!</p>
<p>The third great truth is that of the Incarnation. We know that the Son of God has come. This is the theme with which John opened his Epistle and with which he is now about to close it. The coming of the Lord Jesus revealed to us Him who is true, that is, the true God. God the Father can only be known through the Lord Jesus Christ. “The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.” Then John adds: and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. Again the emphasis is that it is only as we are in Jesus Christ that we can be in God. “No one comes to the Father except through Me.” This is the true God and eternal life. In other words, John is teaching what the Gnostics denied, namely, that Jesus Christ is God, and that eternal life is found only in Him.</p>
<p><strong>CLOSING APPEAL (5:21)<br />
</strong>Lastly, we have John’s final exhortation: “Little children, keep yourselves from idols.” The apostle is saying in effect, “Beware of any teachings which are opposed to these realities.” He wants believers to guard themselves from any ideas concerning God, other than those which have been handed down to us by the apostles. Jesus Christ is God. Any other thought is idolatry. Here John is not speaking primarily of idols carved out of wood. An idol is a substitute or false god taking the place of the true. Here an idol is not so much a material thing as a false teaching.<br />
 </p>
<h6> <br />
LESSON 54 – Books Of  2nd and 3rd John </h6>
<p>Second John<br />
Along with 3rd John this short note is all we have of the priceless personal correspondence of one of the most beloved early saints, the Apostle John.<br />
Sometimes Christians are concerned about how “open” or “closed” they should be to others, especially to those who profess to be believers. Second and Third John answer this very practical question. Second John shows the importance of keeping our house (or house church) closed to heretics; 3 John encourages an “open door policy” to traveling preachers and missionaries.<br />
 <br />
The background of this Epistle is the widespread ministry of itinerant preachers in the early church, still practiced somewhat in certain circles. These evangelists and ministers of the word would receive hospitality, food, and sometimes money at the Christian homes and congregations they visited. Unfortunately, false teachers and religious charlatans were quick to step in and use this custom as a means for easy gain and to spread their heresies, such as Gnosticism.  If it was important in the first century to warn of heretics and “religious profiteers,” what would the Apostle John say if he could see today’s patchwork quilt of sects, cults, and false religions?  The central theme is that we should give no cooperation whatever to a person who is spreading error regarding the Person of our Lord.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE APOSTLE’S SALUTATION: GRACE, MERCY, AND PEACE (Vv. 1–3)<br />
</strong>In 2nd John, the apostle introduces himself as the elder. This may refer to age or official position in the church. As to age, John was the last of the apostles who had companied with the Lord Jesus. As to official position, he surely was a bishop or overseer.   The expression “To the elect lady” is not so easy to explain. Three views are commonly held. (1) Some believe that the elect lady is the church, elsewhere referred to as the Bride of Christ, or a particular local church. (2) Others think that the Letter was addressed to “the elect Kyria”—her name being Kyria. This name could be the Greek equivalent to the Aramaic name Martha (both mean “lady”). (3) Others feel that John is writing to an unnamed Christian lady, who with all other believers is among the elect of God—chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>In reference to the last view, it is especially significant that this warning against anti-christian teachers should be found in a Letter addressed to a woman. Sin first entered the world through Eve’s being deceived by Satan. “The woman being deceived, fell into transgression” (1 Tim. 2:14). Paul speaks of false teachers who make a special appeal to women; they get into the house and capture “gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,” who will listen to anyone and yet are “never able to come to the knowledge of the truth” (2 Tim. 3:6, 7). Even today the false cults visit homes during the daytime, when the man of the house is usually at work. Children need to be warned against false teachers also.</p>
<p>John’s greeting is “grace, mercy, and peace will be with you.” Grace is undeserved favor to those who deserve the opposite. Mercy is pity shown to those who are guilty and wretched. Peace is the harmonious relationship that results from God’s grace and mercy. All three of these blessings are from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ. The Father is the Source and the Son is the Channel.</p>
<p><strong>THE APOSTLE’S JOY: OBEDIENT CHILDREN (V. 4)<br />
</strong>Now John expresses his joy at hearing that some of the children of the elect lady were walking in truth. The truth is not just something to be believed with the mind, but something to be lived out in everyday behavior. Just as the Lord Jesus was the living embodiment of truth, so He expects our lives to be testimonies to the truth.</p>
<p><strong>THE APOSTLE’S CHARGE: TO WALK IN LOVE (Vv. 5, 6)<br />
</strong>In verses 5 through 9, the apostle seems to give a short summary of his First Epistle. There he listed the tests of life. Now in these verses, he repeats at least three of them—the test of love (v. 5), the test of obedience (v. 6), and the test of doctrine (vv. 7–9).</p>
<p>First, he reminds his readers of the commandment to love their fellow believers. Love here is essentially the unselfish giving of oneself for the benefit of others. It is not “What can I get out of that person?” but “What can I do for that person?” Then, love is shown to be a walking according to His commandments. We cannot truly love, in the divine sense, unless we are walking in obedience to the Lord and to the truth of God.</p>
<p><strong>THE APOSTLE’S CONCERN: ANTICHRIST DECEIVERS (Vv. 7–11)<br />
</strong>This brings us to the test of doctrine. The great question is: “Did God really become Man in the Person of Jesus Christ?” The answer is a resounding “Yes!” The Gnostics believed that the divine Christ came upon Jesus of Nazareth for a period of time. But John insists that Jesus Christ was, is, and always will be God.  Therefore, he warns his readers, “Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward.” In other words, stand firm in the truth concerning the Lord Jesus Christ so that our labor among you will not have been in vain, and so that we (the apostles and their followers) will receive a full reward.</p>
<p>When John says, “Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ,” he is speaking of false teachers. To transgress is to go beyond the allowed bounds. That is what the cults do; they claim to have new light and teach doctrines that God has not revealed in His word. They do not stay within the bounds of the Christian revelation, or abide in the doctrine of Christ, probably meaning the teachings which Christ Himself brought. It could also mean all that the Bible teaches about Christ. The apostle emphasizes in verse 9 that a cultist may claim to know God, but if he does not believe in the absolute deity and humanity of the Lord Jesus, he does not have God at all. God can only be known through His Son. “No one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6).</p>
<p>This is the heart of the Epistle. It gives us valued advice on how to deal with false teachers who come to our doors. John does not refer to casual visitors but to anti-Christian propagandists. Should we invite them in? Give them a cup of coffee? Help them financially? Buy their literature? The answer is that we should not receive them or greet them. These people are enemies of Christ. To show them hospitality is to take sides with those who are against our Savior. It is possible that sometime we might let such a person into our house without knowing that he denies the Lord. These verses would not apply in such a case. But when we do know a man to be a false teacher, it would be disloyal to Christ to befriend him. These verses do not apply to visitors generally. We often have unbelievers as guests in an effort to win them to Christ. But here it is a question of religious teachers who deny the deity and humanity of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>THE APOSTLE’S HOPE: A PERSONAL VISIT (Vv. 12, 13)<br />
</strong>John would have liked to say more to the elect lady. But he stops writing at this point in the hope of an early personal visit when he can speak face to face. So John closes: “The children of your elect sister greet you.” We do not know who they were, but we shall meet them some day and enjoy fellowship with them and with the beloved Apostle John who penned this Letter, and best of all with the Savior Himself.</p>
<p> <br />
Third John<br />
Even 3rd John, the shortest book in the NT (just one line shorter than 2nd John in the original), illustrates the divine truth that “all Scripture &#8230; is profitable.” Like 2nd  John, its key words are love and truth. But unlike 2 John, which shows the firmness of love in refusing to entertain those who do not teach the truth, 3 John shows the tenderness of love in helping those who have gone forward with the truth.<br />
The historical backdrop of this little Letter gives us a vivid glimpse into church life in the latter half of the first century. With just a few concise strokes of the pen the apostle sketches in three characters: Gaius the hospitable and spiritual, Demetrius the commendable, and Diotrephes the self-seeking and unloving. Diotrephes may illustrate the strong self-willed personality that can show up in any church structure. On the other hand, he may show the trend toward one elder gaining precedence and rule over a formerly equal eldership. This latter trend evolved into the “monarchical episcopate” (rule of one dominant overseer, or bishop) of the second century and following.<br />
 <br />
<strong>SALUTATION (Vv. 1–4)<br />
</strong>As in his Second Epistle, John speaks of himself as the elder. He addresses the Letter to the beloved Gaius, whom he loves in truth. Although we do not know if this is the Gaius mentioned in Romans 16:23 or the one in Acts 20:4, it is surprising how much we do learn about him in these few verses. First of all, we gather that he was a much beloved believer, a man whose whole life commended him to his fellow Christians.  But apparently he was not too well in body, since John wishes that his physical health might correspond to his spiritual vigor. When John says I pray that you may prosper in all things it is doubtful that he is thinking of wealth or material prosperity. Rather he is speaking of physical well-being, as suggested by the next phrase—and be in health.  Would we want our physical condition to correspond to our spiritual? Is it not sadly true that we take better care of our bodies than of our souls? That is why F. B. Meyer wryly remarked: “It would not be desirable to express the wish of verse 2 to all our friends, because if their bodies were to correspond to the condition of their souls, they would suddenly fall into ill-health.”</p>
<p>Verse 2 flatly contradicts what is taught by many so-called “faith-healers.” They contend that all sickness is a result of sin in the life, and that if a person isn’t healed, it’s because of a lack of faith. This certainly wasn’t true in Gaius’ case. His spiritual condition was good, but his physical condition was not so good. This shows that one’s spiritual state cannot be argued from the bodily one.</p>
<p>V. 3 The apostle rejoiced greatly when certain brethren came and testified of the truth that was in Gaius, and how he walked in the truth. It is good to have the truth in us but it is better to manifest the truth in our lives. We should not only hold the truth, but allow the truth to hold us. Men would rather see a sermon than hear one. Nothing counts more for God in an age of fact than a holy life.<br />
So important was this to John that he could say, “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.” Perhaps most of us think of soul-winning as the greatest joy of the Christian life, and it is wonderful indeed to see men and women translated from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of the Son of His love. But who can measure the heartache to see those who professed to be saved living like heathens in the church, hurting not only their witness, but other people by their hypocrisy. </p>
<p><strong>THE GODLY GAIUS (Vv. 5–8)<br />
</strong>Gaius took a special delight in throwing open his home to those who had gone out preaching the gospel. He extended his gracious hospitality not only to those whom he knew, but to strangers as well. John says that he was faithful in this ministry. It appears from the NT that hospitality is very important in God’s sight. If we entertain the Lord’s people, it is the same as if we entertain the Lord Himself (Matt. 25:40). On the other hand, failure to entertain His servants is looked upon as failure to entertain Him (Matt. 25:45). Through entertaining strangers, “some have unwittingly entertained angels” (Heb. 13:2). Many can testify that through the practice of hospitality, meals have been turned into sacraments (Luke 24:29–35), children have been converted, and families have been drawn closer to the Lord.</p>
<p>Rewards are involved. Gaius’ kindness was known to all the church. But more than that, his name is forever enshrined in God’s Holy Word as one who had an open home and an open heart. And even more, Gaius will yet be rewarded at the Judgment Seat of Christ, for “he who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward” (Matt. 10:41). He will share in the reward of all those preachers he entertained. This is a good point to remember for those who cannot preach: You can receive a preacher’s reward by showing hospitality to preachers in the name of the Lord. God will pay back all good deeds! His kindness will crown the kindness of men.<br />
 <br />
A special reason is given why Gaius should be helpful to these itinerant evangelists: Because they went forth for His name’s sake taking nothing from the Gentiles. These men looked to the Lord alone for the supply of their needs. They would not accept support from the unconverted. To do so would imply that their Master was too poor to provide for them. It might also give the unsaved a false ground of self-righteousness on which to rest. What a rebuke this is to the money-raising methods of Christendom today! And how it should remind us of the special obligation we have toward those servants of the Lord who go out in faith in the living God and who make their needs known to no one but the Lord.<br />
We therefore ought to receive such, that we may become fellow workers for the truth. To receive them means to do everything possible to help them, for when we do, we help the truth in its onward march.</p>
<p><strong>THE DICTATORIAL DIOTREPHES (Vv. 9–11)<br />
</strong>Apparently John had written along this line to the church, but his Letter was intercepted by a man named Diotrephes, who had an exaggerated view of his own importance. He was a virtual dictator in the assembly. His sin was pride of place, an inflated ego, and a violent jealousy for what he regarded as his own rights.  Diotrephes had forgotten that Christ is the Head of the church!  He had forgotten that the Holy Spirit is the Vicar or Representative of Christ in the church.  Not only did he refuse true believers, but he excommunicated those who did receive them. He was a power-mad creature, prating against God’s true servants with malicious words. John will remember him on his next visit to that assembly! Such self-styled popes cannot stand being openly denounced from the word of God. Their continuance in power depends upon secret meetings and upon a reign of fear and intimidation.</p>
<p>Gaius is exhorted to turn away from such evil behavior and to follow what is good. Good works are an evidence of relationship with God. That being so, the apostle seems to cast grave doubts on the spiritual state of Diotrephes.</p>
<p><strong>DEVOUT DEMETRIUS (V. 12)<br />
</strong>Perhaps Demetrius was the bearer of this Letter. At any rate, he had a good testimony from all, and from the truth itself.</p>
<p><strong>THE APOSTLE’S PLAN AND BENEDICTION (Vv. 13, 14)<br />
</strong>John closes in much the same way as he closed his Second Epistle—delaying discussion until face to face reunion. We are indebted to him for these Letters, giving us an insight into life in the early days of Christianity, and setting forth timeless instruction for the people of God. Soon we shall speak face to face in heaven, and then we shall understand more fully the occasional obscurities of divine revelation.</p>
<h6>LESSON 55 – Book Of  Jude </h6>
<p>Just as Luke begins Christian history with the Acts of the Apostles, Jude is chosen to write the next to the last book of the NT, which has been appropriately called “the Acts of the Apostates.” Jude would have preferred to write about the common Christian Faith shared with his readers, but false teachings were becoming so prevalent that he was constrained to pen a plea to “contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.”<br />
Jude does not mince words! He pulls out all the stops, as it were, to unmask these notorious heretics, drawing illustrations from nature, the OT, and Jewish tradition (the Book of Enoch) to stir up the faithful.</p>
<p>The church is forever in debt to Jude for the beautiful benediction with which he ends his Letter. His Epistle may be short, but it is greatly needed in these days of ever-increasing apostasy.</p>
<p><strong>Authorship</strong><br />
The author of this short Epistle is Judas (Jude), a younger half-brother of our Lord and a brother of James. He shares with the Lord Jesus and with James in his use of nature illustrations and a trenchant, colorful style.  Like his brother James, Jude was too modest to exploit his natural relationship to the Savior. After all, it is spiritual relationship to the Lord Jesus that counts. Did Christ not say, “Whoever does the will of My Father in heaven is My brother and sister and mother” (Matt. 12:50)? On another occasion He taught that it was more blessed to hear the word of God and do it than to be a close blood-relative of His (Luke 11:27, 28). Like James, Jude took the place of “a bondservant.” Since both brothers disbelieved in their divine Half-brother until after the resurrection, this was a suitable spirit to show. Jude was married and took his wife around on his itinerant preaching tours (1 Cor. 9:5). Jude’s grandsons were brought before Emperor Domitian in the 90’s on the charge of being Christians.<br />
 <br />
Whether Peter used Jude, or Jude adapted 2 Peter (or both used a common source) is debated. The similarities between the two are too great to be coincidental. Since Peter writes in his Second Epistle (2:1 and 3:3) that there “will be” false teachers and scoffers, and Jude says such men “have crept in” (v. 4), it is probable that Jude is the later writer. A date between 67 and 80 is likely.</p>
<p>Jude is concerned with apostasy. Even in his day, the church was already being infiltrated by “religious” men who posed as servants of God but who were actually enemies of the cross of Christ. Jude’s purpose is to expose these traitors and to describe their ultimate doom.</p>
<p>An apostate is a person who professes to be a true believer but who, as a matter of fact, has never been regenerated. He may be baptized and participate fully in the privileges of a local Christian fellowship. But after a while, he willfully abandons the Christian faith and maliciously renounces the Savior. He denies the deity of Christ, His redemptive work at Calvary, His bodily resurrection, or other fundamental doctrines.  It is not at all a question of backsliding; the apostate was never converted at all. He has no qualms about his deliberate spurning of God’s only way of salvation. He is hardened in his unbelief and stubbornly opposed to the Christ of God.  Apostasy is not simply a question of denying the Savior. Peter did that. Peter was a true believer who buckled under the pressures of a crisis. But he really loved the Lord and demonstrated the reality of his faith by his subsequent repentance and restoration.  Judas Iscariot was an apostate. He professed to be a disciple; he traveled with the Lord Jesus for about three years. He even served as treasurer of the team, but finally he revealed his true self by betraying the Lord for thirty pieces of silver.  Apostasy is a sin leading to death, one that lies beyond the responsibility of believers’ prayers (1 Jn. 5:16b). It is impossible to renew an apostate to repentance, since he crucifies to himself the Son of God, and puts Him to open shame (Heb. 6:6). For those who thus sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, “there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries” (Heb. 10:26, 27).</p>
<p>Peter gives a detailed portrait of the apostate false teachers who will arise in the last days (2 Pet. 2). In some respects, his description closely parallels that which is given by Jude. The resemblance may be seen by comparing the following:<br />
Jude 2 Peter<br />
V. 4 2:1–3<br />
V. 7 2:6<br />
V. 8 2:10<br />
V. 9 2:11<br />
V. 10 2:12<br />
V. 16 2:18</p>
<p>But actually the differences between the two passages are more significant than the similarities. Jude makes no mention of Noah, the flood, or Lot. Peter omits any mention of the Israelites who were saved out of Egypt, of Michael, Cain, Korah, or of Enoch’s prophecy. He does not give as much information about the angels that sinned as Jude does. He speaks of the false teachers as denying the Master who bought them, whereas Jude elaborates by saying that they “turn the grace of our God into lewdness and deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ” (Jude 4).  So instead of thinking of the two chapters as carbon copies, we should realize that the Holy Spirit has selected materials to suit his purpose in each case, and that the two chapters do not overlap as much as they might seem at first. Those who have studied the four Gospels and have compared Ephesians and Colossians realize that the Spirit of God never needlessly repeats Himself. There are spiritual meanings behind the similarities and differences, if only we have eyes to see them.</p>
<p><strong>INTRODUCTION (verses 1-2)<br />
</strong>God used a righteous Jude to unmask the apostates, of whom another Jude, Judas Iscariot, was a prime example. All that we know for certain about the good Jude is that he was a bondservant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James.<br />
In addressing the Letter, Jude gives three designations that are true of all believers. They are called, sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ. God has called these out of the world by the gospel to belong to Himself. They are set apart by God to be God’s special and pure people. And they are marvelously preserved from danger, damage, defilement, and damnation until at last they are ushered in to see the King in His beauty.</p>
<p>Jude wishes for his readers mercy, peace, and love. The greeting is peculiarly suited to those who were facing the onslaught of those whose aim was to subvert the faith. Mercy means God’s compassionate comfort and care for His beleaguered saints in times of conflict and stress. Peace is the serenity and confidence that come from reliance on God’s word and from looking above circumstances to the One who overrules all circumstances for the accomplishment of His own purposes. Love is the undeserved embrace of God for His dear people—a super-affection that should then be shared with others.</p>
<p><strong>THE APOSTATES UNMASKED (Vv. 3–16)</strong><br />
Jude had originally intended to write about the glorious salvation that is the common possession of all believers. But God’s Spirit so influenced this yielded scribe that he sensed a change of direction. A simple doctrinal essay would no longer do; it must be a fervent appeal that would strengthen the readers. They must be stirred up to contend earnestly for the faith. Attacks were being made on the sacred Christian truth, and efforts were already launched to whittle away the great fundamental doctrines. God’s people must stand uncompromisingly for the inspiration, inerrancy, authority, and sufficiency of God’s Holy Word.  Yet in contending for the faith, the believer must speak and act as a Christian. As Paul wrote: “A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient” (2 Tim. 2:24). He must contend without being contentious, and testify without ruining his testimony.</p>
<p>What we contend earnestly for is the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints.  The body of doctrine is complete. The canon is finished. Nothing more can be added.  When some teacher claims to have a revelation which is above and beyond what is found in the Bible, we reject it out of hand. The faith has been delivered and we neither need nor heed anything else. This is our answer to the leaders of false cults with their books that claim equal authority with the Scriptures.  If men choose to “fall away” from the Christian Faith, then their condemnation is the same as that of the unbelieving Israelites in the wilderness, the rebel angels, and the Sodomites. They are not foreordained to fall away, but once they do apostatize by their own choice, they face the punishment predetermined for all apostates.</p>
<p>Two prominent features of these ungodly persons are their depraved conduct and their corrupt doctrine. In their behavior, they turn the grace of God into lewdness. They twist Christian liberty into license, and pervert freedom to serve into freedom to sin. In their doctrine, they deny the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ. They deny His absolute right to rule, His deity, His vicarious death, His resurrection—in fact, they deny every essential doctrine of His Person and work. While professing an expansive liberality in the spiritual realm, they are dogmatically and viciously opposed to the gospel, to the value of the precious blood of Christ, and to His being the only way of salvation.</p>
<p>Who are these men? They are supposed ministers of the gospel. They hold positions of leadership in Christendom. Some are bishops or church council members or seminary professors. But they all have this in common—they are against the Christ of the Bible and have invented for themselves a liberal or Neo-Orthodox “Christ”, stripped of glory, majesty, dominion, and authority.</p>
<p>Jude launches into a description of their sins, their indictment, their counterparts in nature, their doom, and their ungodly words and deeds (vv. 8–16).  Like Balaam, the false teachers of today are suave and convincing. They can speak out of both corners of their mouths at once. They suppress the truth in order to increase their income. The principal point is that they are greedy, seeking to make the house of God a house of merchandise.  Christendom today is leavened by the sin of simony. If the profit motive could somehow be removed, much of what passes as Christian work would come to a screeching halt.<br />
 <br />
Their ungodly words and deeds are now described in more detail. They are grumblers, complaining against the providences of God instead of being thankful for His mercies. The fact that God hates such griping is abundantly proved by His punishment of Israel in the wilderness.  They are always finding fault with the Lord. Why does He permit wars and suffering? Why doesn’t He put an end to all the social injustice? If He is all-powerful, why doesn’t He do something about the mess the world is in? They also find fault with God’s people for being narrow-minded in creed and puritanical in conduct.  They live lustfully, indulging the passions of the flesh and being the loudest in advocating permissiveness in the sexual realm.  Their arrogant speech proves a real attention-getter. By their shocking espousal of political, economic, and social extremism, they make the headlines. And their bold, shameless repudiation of basic Christian doctrines, such as their assertion that God is dead, give them a certain notoriety among liberal theologians.  Finally, they are masters in the art of flattery, thereby gaining a following for themselves and a comfortable income as well.</p>
<p><strong>THE BELIEVER’S ROLE IN THE MIDST OF APOSTASY (Vv. 17–23)<br />
</strong>Jude now turns away from the apostates to the believers’ role in the midst of these times. First he reminds them that they have been forewarned as to the oncoming peril. Then he encourages them to maintain themselves in a strong spiritual condition. Finally, he counsels them to use discernment in ministering to those who have been victimized by the apostates.</p>
<p>The apostles had predicted the rise of false teachers. This can be seen in the ministry of Paul (Acts 20:29, 30; 1 Tim. 4:1–5; 2 Tim. 3:1–9); Peter (2 Pet. 2:1–22; 3:1–4); and John (1 Jn. 2:18, 19).  The gist of their message was that in the last time, mockers would appear, following their own ungodly lusts.  To this testimony Jude now adds the explanation that these scoffers have three prominent characteristics. They are sensual persons, which means that they think and act as natural men. They cause divisions, drawing disciples after themselves and perhaps dividing people into various classes according to their progress in apostasy. They do not have the Spirit. They were never born from above and therefore have a total incapacity to understand the things of God.</p>
<p>The believer’s resource, of course, is to stay close to the Lord and live in unbroken fellowship with Him. But how is this done? Jude gives four steps.<br />
The first is building yourselves up on your most holy faith, that is, the Christian faith. We build up ourselves on it by studying and obeying the Bible. Constant familiarity with the word guides us positively in the way of righteousness, and warns us against the perils along the way.</p>
<p>The second step is praying in the Holy Spirit. This means to pray as guided by the Spirit, in accordance with the will of God as revealed in the Bible or as privately revealed by the Spirit in a subjective way to the believer. It is in contrast to prayers which are recited mechanically or spun off without any real spiritual involvement.</p>
<p>Then again believers are to keep themselves in the love of God. Here the love of God can be compared to the sunshine. The sun is always shining. But when something comes between us and the sun, we are no longer in the sunshine. That’s the way it is with the love of God. It is always beaming down upon us. But if sin comes between us and the Lord, then we are no longer enjoying His love in practice. We can keep ourselves in His love first of all by lives of holiness and godliness. And if sin should come between, then we should confess and forsake that sin immediately. The secret is to let nothing come between us and God.<br />
 <br />
Finally, we should be eagerly looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life. The mercy of our Lord here refers to His ultimate return to take His people home. In days of darkness and apostasy, we are to keep the light of the blessed hope burning in our hearts. It will prove a comforting and purifying hope (1 Thess. 4:18; 1 Jn. 3:3).</p>
<p>A certain measure of spiritual discernment is necessary in dealing with victims of apostasy. The Scriptures make a distinction between the way we should handle those who are active propagandists of false cults and those who have been duped by them. In the case of the leaders and propagandists, the policy is given in 2 John 10, 11: “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.” But in speaking of those who have been deceived by false teachers, Jude counsels making a distinction and gives two separate courses of action.</p>
<p>On some we should have compassion. That is, we should show a compassionate interest in them and try to guide them out of doubts and disputations into a firm conviction of divine truth.  Then there are those who are on the verge of the precipice, ready to fall over into the flames of apostasy. These we are to save by strong, resolute warning and instruction, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh. In the OT the clothing of a leper was contaminated and had to be burned (Lev. 13:47–52).  Whatever is associated with a life of sin should be cast off and renounced, if we are to be safe from the infection and contagion of this soul-destroying disease.<br />
 <br />
<strong>THE BEAUTIFUL BENEDICTION (Vv. 24, 25)<br />
</strong>Jude closes with a beautiful benediction. It is an absolute statement about “Him who is able.”  He is able to save (Heb. 7:25), able to establish (Rom. 16:25), able to aid (Heb. 2:18), able to subdue (Phil. 3:21)—and here He is able to keep. He is able to keep us in perfect peace (Isa. 26:3), He is able to keep that which we have committed to Him until that Day (2 Tim. 1:12), He is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think (Eph. 3:20), and He is able to keep us from stumbling. This latter promise is especially timely for the days of apostasy to which Jude is referring.</p>
<p>But the promise doesn’t stop there. He is able to make us stand faultless in the presence of His glory with exceeding joy. This is truly stupendous! When we think of what we were—dead through our trespasses and sins; when we think of what we are—poor, weak, failing servants; and then to think that one day we will stand absolutely faultless in the Throne Room of the universe, rejoicing with exceeding joy—what grace is this!<br />
 <br />
If worship (Old English word that was literally “worth-ship”) means ascribing to God what He is worthy of, it will be glory, and majesty, dominion, and power. Glory—the superlative honor He deserves for all He is and all He has done for us. Majesty—the dignity and splendor He deserves as the Supreme Monarch of the universe. Dominion—the unchallenged sway which is His by sovereign right. And power or authority—the might and prerogative to rule all that His hands have made.  He was worthy of such praise in the past, He is worthy at the present time, and He will be worthy of it throughout eternity. Apostates and false teachers may seek to rob Him of glory, detract from His majesty, grumble against His dominion, and challenge His power. But all true believers find their greatest fulfillment in glorifying and enjoying Him both now and forever.<br />
Amen.</p>
