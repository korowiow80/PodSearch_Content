            <title>Krugman: Our Economic Catastrophe Could Be Solved Easily</title>
            <description>Paul Krugman, columnist for The New York Times and author of End This Depression Now!, asserts that Congress and uncompromising politicians are standing in the way of true economic recovery. Krugman believes that there are “easy fixes”, but that leaders are failing to act.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Complete video available for purchase at http://fora.tv/2012/05/22/Paul_Krugman_End_This_Depression_Now&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nobel Laureate economist Krugman believes that the U.S. and world economies are not getting better. He says we are still in the midst of a depression rather than a recession, and that “nations, rich in resources, talent, and knowledge, all the ingredients for prosperity and a decent standard of living for all, remain in a state of intense pain.”  Yet he also believes that a quick, strong recovery is but one step away.  Come hear his thoughts on what political leaders can and must do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul Krugman is Professor of Economics and International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, at Princeton University, and an Op-Ed columnist for the Times. His numerous books include &quot;The Great Unraveling,&quot; &quot;The Conscience of a Liberal,&quot; and &quot;The Return of Depression Economics,&quot; an updated edition of which was published in 2009. For his contributions to New Trade Theory, he received the 2008 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences.</description>

            <title>Conan O'Brien: The 'Ron Burgundy' Strategy Drives Viewers</title>
            <description>In a one-on-one conversation with Piers Morgan, Conan O'Brien, host of “Conan” on TBS, discusses how his production team leverages new media to increase his late-night audience. Abandoning advertising models of 90s television, “Conan” casts a wider net by posting its content in bite-sized pieces throughout the web.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Complete video available for free at http://fora.tv/2012/05/23/Cable_Show_2012_3rd_General_Session_Conan_OBrien&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In a consumer environment where more people have smartphones than DVRs, devising the right strategies for success in media and communications is more complicated than ever. Yet standout companies continue to deliver growth from mainstay businesses while innovating in the new, always-connected environment. This General Session featuring influential participants in content and distribution takes a wide-angle view of the revolution in media technology, its implications for customer behavior, and the ways innovative companies are positioning themselves to take advantage of an anytime, anywhere, anything-goes media environment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With “a comic identity as distinctive as his name,” according to The New York Times, Conan O’Brien has firmly established himself in the late night comedy universe. Hailed by The Washington Post as “modest, wry, self-effacing and demonstrably the most intelligent of the late-night comics,” O’Brien’s unique brand of comedy has earned Conan the title “Late Night’s King of Cool” from Entertainment Weekly.</description>

            <title>Criminal Intent and Predicting the Mental State of Others</title>
            <description>Dr. Dorothy Cheney, an expert on primate social behavior and communication, examines the human trait of predicting the mental state of others. Cheney uses the example of the Murdoch phone hacking incident as an example to illustrate criminal intent.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Studies on both animals and humans have shown definitively that individuals who are able to establish strong social bonds experience better health and higher offspring survival. It seems likely that natural selection has also favored the cognitive abilities to monitor and manage social relationships. There is growing evidence that monkeys and other animals are adept at recognizing other individuals’ social relationships and dominance ranks. At the same time, there are also many fundamental differences between animal social cognition and the social cognition of humans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dr. Dorothy Cheney is an expert on primate social behavior, communication, cognition. In 1977, together with her husband and collaborator Robert Seyfarth, she began an 11 year field study of vervet monkeys in Kenya, which led to the publication of How Monkeys See the World. From 1992 through 2007 Dr. Cheney and Dr. Seyfarth studied baboons in the Okavango Delta of Botswana. In 2007, they published Baboon Metaphysics.</description>

            <title>Edward O. Wilson on the Human Condition</title>
            <description>Edward O. Wilson, biologist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner, discusses the nature of humans, and what lies ahead for our species.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Watch the complete video for free at http://fora.tv/2012/04/20/Edward_O_Wilson_The_Social_Conquest_of_Earth&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edward O. Wilson has revolutionized science and inspired the public more often than any other living biologist. Now he is blending his pioneer work on ants with a new perspective on human development to propose a radical reframing of how evolution works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First the social insects ruled, from 60 million years ago. Then a species of social mammals took over, from 10 thousand years ago. Both sets of “eusocial” animals mastered the supremely delicate art of encouraging altruism, so that individuals in the groups would act as if they value the goal of the group over their own goals. They would specialize for the group and die for the group. In recent decades the idea of “kin selection” seemed to explain how such an astonishing phenomenon could evolve. Wilson replaces kin selection with “multi-level selection,” which incorporates both individual selection (long well understood) and group selection (long considered taboo). Every human and every human society has to learn how to manage adroitly the perpetual ambiguity and conflict between individual needs and group needs. What I need is never the same as what we need.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
E. O. Wilson’s current book is The Social Conquest of Earth. His previous works include The Superorganism;The Future of Life; Consilience; Biophilia; Sociobiology; and The Insect Societies.</description>

A human female is born, lives her life, and dies within the span of a few decades, but the shape of her life has been strongly influenced by 50 million years of primate evolution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Join leading scientists for a special symposium at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco as they discuss the The Female in Evolution. This rich topic will be considered in the context of the three research areas funded by The Leakey Foundation; Paleoanthropology, Behavioral and Hunter-gatherers and will integrate life history, behavior, anatomy, development, and cultural identity of females.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dean Falk is an evolutionary anthropologist who splits her time between Santa Fe, New Mexico where she is a Senior Scholar at the School for Advanced Research (SAR), and Tallahassee, Florida where she is the Hale G. Smith Professor of Anthropology at Florida State University. Her work focuses on the evolution of the human brain and cognition. Recent projects include collaborative research on Homo floresiensis (&quot;Hobbit&quot;) and an investigation of the brain of Albert Einstein.</description>

            <description>Clayton Christensen, Professor of Business Administration at the Harvard Business School, argues that despite developing a groundbreaking idea, Facebook hasn’t proven itself to be an innovative company. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Traditionally, big companies have been vulnerable to disruptive start-ups who can move more nimbly into new markets. But companies today are learning how to build disruption into their DNA. This session will explore the intersection between leadership, corporate culture, and disruptive innovation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ideas Economy: Innovation will explore the role of governments, corporations and individuals as drivers of innovation and will develop prescriptions that lead to lasting progress and prosperity.   Conference attendees will engage in a lively examination of current political and economic policies around the world, develop a keen understanding of how the forces of globalization affect the ways companies innovate and manage innovation, and discuss what individuals can do, not only to energize their own creative and intellectual potential, but to develop jobs, improve company earnings, and contribute to economic growth around the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clayton M. Christensen is the architect of and the world's foremost authority on disruptive innovation, a framework which describes the process by which a product or service takes root initially in simple applications at the bottom of a market and then relentlessly moves &quot;up market,&quot; eventually displacing established competitors. Consistently acknowledged in rankings and surveys as one of the world's leading thinkers on innovation, Christensen is widely sought after as a speaker, advisor and board member. His research has been applied to national economies, start-up and Fortune 50 companies, as well as to early and late stage investing.</description>

            <title>Does Culture Affect How Bodies Function?</title>
            <description>Anne Harrington, Professor of the History of Science at Harvard University, questions the assumption that all human bodies work in the same way regardless of culture or environment.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
As we use the tools of science to explore the nature of humanity, we are learning more and more about how our brains function and what motivates our behavior, built-in biases and blind spots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These fresh insights are interesting scientifically, but they also evoke significant questions about our lived experience. These perspectives challenge our basic assumptions of who we are, both as individuals and as a society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Anne Harrington is Professor and former Chair of the History of Science at Harvard University, specializing in the history of psychiatry, neuroscience, and the other mind and behavioral sciences. Professor Harrington received her Ph.D. in the History of Science from Oxford University, and has held postdoctoral fellowships at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine in London, and the University of Freiburg in Germany.</description>

As we use the tools of science to explore the nature of humanity, we are learning more and more about how our brains function and what motivates our behavior, built-in biases and blind spots.

These fresh insights are interesting scientifically, but they also evoke significant questions about our lived experience. These perspectives challenge our basic assumptions of who we are, both as individuals and as a society.

Anne Harrington is Professor and former Chair of the History of Science at Harvard University, specializing in the history of psychiatry, neuroscience, and the other mind and behavioral sciences. Professor Harrington received her Ph.D. in the History of Science from Oxford University, and has held postdoctoral fellowships at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine in London, and the University of Freiburg in Germany.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Harold Bloom: Why There Is No Walt Whitman Stamp</title>
            <description>In a talk about the works of Walt Whitman, renowned literary critic Harold Bloom digresses about why Whitman wasn't honored with a postage stamp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Complete video at: http://fora.tv/2012/03/19/Harold_Bloom_Criticism_and_Self-Influence&lt;br /&gt;
Titled &quot;Criticism and Self-Influence,&quot; focusing on his readings of Whitman in his first lecture and of Shakespeare in his second, these lectures are contributions to Bloom's intellectual biography. They will give a sense of how Harold Bloom reads, what stirs his mind, what he looks for, and what he projects on a text. With so impressive a list of works to his credit, Bloom will assess not only his impact on the world of literary criticism, but also his vision as a man of letters who has taught us how to think about that one subject that will always challenge our ability to think: art.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Harold Bloom is a Sterling Professor of the Humanities at Yale University and a former Charles Eliot Norton Professor at Harvard. His more than thirty books include The Best Poems of the English Language, The Art of Reading Poetry, and The Book of J. He is a MacArthur Prize Fellow, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, and the recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, including the Academy's Gold Medal for Belles Lettres and Criticism, the International Prize of Catalonia, and the Alfonso Reyes Prize of Mexico.</description>

Dr. Laurie Santos, who has been called &quot;the Monkey Whisperer,&quot; studies the roots of human irrationality by watching the way our primate relatives make decisions. She'll discuss her recent work on &quot;monkey economics&quot; and will show that some of the silly financial choices seen in humans can be observed in monkeys too. Come hear the intriguing thoughts of the woman recently voted one of Popular Science magazine's &quot;Brilliant 10&quot; Young Minds.&lt;br /&gt;

In an age where brands have the tools to generate compelling content and connect directly with consumers, advertising is becoming a tax that brands have to pay.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Neurologist V.S. Ramachandran on the Mirror Neuron Effect</title>
            <description>V.S. Ramachandran explains what causes amputees to have sensations in their phantom limbs, the parts of the brain called mirror neurons. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Complete video at: http://fora.tv/2012/03/24/Being_Human_Perception_Sensations&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As we use the tools of science to explore the nature of humanity, we are learning more and more about how our brains function and what motivates our behavior, built-in biases and blind spots.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These fresh insights are interesting scientifically, but they also evoke significant questions about our lived experience. These perspectives challenge our basic assumptions of who we are, both as individuals and as a society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
V.S. Ramachandran is a neurologist best known for his work in the fields of behavioral neurology and psychophysics. He is currently the Director of the Center for Brain and Cognition at the University of California, San Diego. He is also the author of several books including Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind (1998) and The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientists Quest for What Makes Us Human (2010).</description>

As we use the tools of science to explore the nature of humanity, we are learning more and more about how our brains function and what motivates our behavior, built-in biases and blind spots.

These fresh insights are interesting scientifically, but they also evoke significant questions about our lived experience. These perspectives challenge our basic assumptions of who we are, both as individuals and as a society.

V.S. Ramachandran is a neurologist best known for his work in the fields of behavioral neurology and psychophysics. He is currently the Director of the Center for Brain and Cognition at the University of California, San Diego. He is also the author of several books including Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind (1998) and The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientists Quest for What Makes Us Human (2010).</itunes:summary>

            <title>Vivek Wadhwa: Chinese Innovation is a 'Giant Scam'</title>
            <description>Vivek Wadhwa, Visiting Scholar at UC Berkeley's School of Information, argues that Chinese innovation lags far behind innovation in the United States because China's rigid political structure doesn't allow for risk-taking.&lt;br /&gt;

Complete video at: http://fora.tv/2012/03/28/An_Economist-Style_Debate_on_Global_Innovation&lt;br /&gt;
Proposition: America is winning the innovation race&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Staggering growth in developing economies—as well as new networking technologies and a renewed spirit of entrepreneurialism—is democratizing innovation throughout much of the world. Yet, huge global risks threaten to impede the pace of innovation. Countries from America to Japan are reeling under the weight of enormous debts. Emerging economies from China to Brazil, which have surged in recent years, are battling growing pains—like inflation and widening inequality. In Europe, chronic defaults and bailouts threaten the future of the euro itself. The result is a global political and economic climate that makes fueling innovation both difficult and necessary. With crucial presidential elections unfolding in many large countries throughout the world in 2012, now is the time to answer crucial questions about how to boost innovation—to propel nations and solve the world's problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ideas Economy: Innovation will explore the role of governments, corporations and individuals as drivers of innovation and will develop prescriptions that lead to lasting progress and prosperity.   Conference attendees will engage in a lively examination of current political and economic policies around the world, develop a keen understanding of how the forces of globalization affect the ways companies innovate and manage innovation, and discuss what individuals can do, not only to energize their own creative and intellectual potential, but to develop jobs, improve company earnings, and contribute to economic growth around the world.</description>

            <title>Thomas Drake: '9/11 Became a Profit Center' for the NSA</title>
            <description>Thomas Drake, a former National Security Agency senior officer who blew the whistle on the NSA “Trailblazer” surveillance program, talks about NSA's commitment to national security profit-making after 9/11. Stating that “9/11 became a profit center”, Drake warns that the NSA has become a “jobs program”, in line with the military industrial complex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Complete video at: http://fora.tv/2012/04/04/National_Security_Secrecy_and_Surveillance&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The scale of government secrecy and surveillance has surpassed all previous boundaries—especially in the national security arena, where the budgets, size and scope of intelligence agencies have ballooned since 9/11. Unprecedented secrecy is largely evading traditional oversight mechanisms, leaving policy makers, the media, and the public in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What impact are secret governmental operations having on our democratic processes, and are the decisions that are being made behind closed doors helping or harming our national security? What tools are available to penetrate this secrecy, foster a new culture of government accountability, and impose enforceable constraints on intrusive surveillance of innocent Americans?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thomas Andrews Drake is a former senior official of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), decorated United States Air Force and United States Navy veteran, computer software expert, linguist, management and leadership specialist, and whistleblower. In 2010 the government alleged that he 'mishandled' documents, one of the few such Espionage Act cases in U.S. history. His defenders claim that he was instead being persecuted for challenging the Trailblazer Project. He is the 2011 recipient of the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling and co-recipient of the Sam Adams Associates for Integrity in Intelligence (SAAII) award.</description>

            <title>'Kony 2012' and the Portrayal of African Conflict</title>
            <description>Kamari Maxine Clarke, Associate Professor of Anthropology and a Research Associate at the Yale Law School, talks about the controversial message of the most viral video of all time, “Kony 2012”, and the implication of the “oversimplified” narrative.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Complete video at: http://fora.tv/2012/03/30/Annual_Ben_Ferencz_Panel_Africa_and_the_ICC&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although initially a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC), the African Union (AU) has emerged in recent years as a strong opponent of the Court’s work. With only African situations and accused persons in the ICC dock, the AU now insists that the ICC has become an imperialist neo-colonial institution. This interdisciplinary panel will discuss the mounting AU/ICC tension; assess the legal, historical, and policy reasons that explain the complex on-off relationship, and consider its implications for the future of the ICC.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which problems is international law particularly well-suited to solve? Which seem to defy its regulation? What tools does international law have to manage this complexity? Where are best practices emerging? What has our profession learned in the last half-century? Is law, with its emphasis on rules and stability, conceptually and functionally capable of responding to the challenges of complexity? If not, how should law react? What do experts from outside the legal profession, from technology, finance, counterinsurgency, climate science, and risk, believe law can add? During the 2012 ASIL Annual Meeting we will address these questions and discuss how international law responds to complexity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kamari Maxine Clarke, Ph.D., University of California, Santa Cruz, 1997, M.A. Yale Law 2002, is an Associate Professor of Anthropology and a Research Associate at the Yale Law School, with a courtesy appointment in African American Studies.

As we use the tools of science to explore the nature of humanity, we are learning more and more about how our brains function and what motivates our behavior, built-in biases and blind spots.

These fresh insights are interesting scientifically, but they also evoke significant questions about our lived experience. These perspectives challenge our basic assumptions of who we are, both as individuals and as a society.

Beau Lotto is founder of Lottolab, a hybrid art studio and science lab. With glowing, interactive sculpture - and good, old-fashioned peer-reviewed research - he's illuminating the mysteries of the brain's visual system.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Spirit and Opportunity: Roving Mars' Landscape</title>
            <description>William J. Clancey, Chief Scientist of Human-Centered Computing at the Intelligent Systems Division of the NASA Ames Center, talks about the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) program. Adjusting to Mars' atmosphere, Clancey shares that the two teams controlling separate rovers even adopted Mars' time schedule.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
For more than eight years, scientists have been doing fieldwork on Mars, the first overland investigation of another planet. Working through programmed robotic laboratories, called the Mars Exploration Rovers, they have a virtual experience of being on Mars. The Spirit and Opportunity teams have driven over 25 miles, taken thousands of photographs, analyzed the chemistry of the terrain, and inspected rocks by grinding them and taking microscopic images. How does working remotely through a robotic laboratory change the nature of field science? How does it change the scientists? A cognitive scientist with privileged access to mission operations, Clancey explains that the “robotic geologists” are not the rovers, but the scientists who have imaginatively projected themselves into the body of the machine.</description>

            <title>Romney and Religion: Is America Ready for a Mormon President?</title>
            <description>TIME Magazine's Joe Klein and BuzzFeed's Ben Smith weigh in on what Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney actually believes in, and whether America is ready for a Mormon president. Klein predicts that Romney's faith leads him to be “mistrustful of the outside world”, and Klein argues that Romney's measured demeanor could affect his chance of winning the election.&lt;br /&gt;
