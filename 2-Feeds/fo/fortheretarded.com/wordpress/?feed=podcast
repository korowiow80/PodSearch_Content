In this week's debut episode, we give a brief introduction to who we are and what we do, and take a trip down memory lane with stories from the video store from where the MCFTR concept was born. Plus, we unveil our regular columns: "MCFTR Haiku Corner", which will feature an original haiku every week; "Movie Marriages", a fake trailer combining the elements of two classics, and "Lost in Translation", where we take an iconic movie scene, translate it to a couple of foreign languages and then back to English, and then poorly act it out... </p>
