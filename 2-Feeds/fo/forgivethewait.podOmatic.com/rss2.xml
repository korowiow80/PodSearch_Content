      <title>Episode 002: Why Abuse Isn't Reported</title>
      <description>Welcome to our second offical episode! We're happy to be back and podcasting again. In this episode we discuss why abuse isn't reported. It's broken down into two sections. The first part talks about children and the second discusses adults. We also do some comparisons between children and adults, finding the similarities about why they don't report the abuse. 

Also touched on are ways to notice the abuse and instructions on how to change the societal cycle of &quot;turning the blind eye&quot; and &quot;victim blaming.&quot;

The song played in this show is called &quot;It Angers Me So&quot; by Finniston. You can hear more music by Finniston here: http://www.finniston.com

      <title>Episode 001.5: The Hosts and What They've Lost</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/20142/600x600_639909.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello everyone. We're so sorry that we haven't gotten our next episode out yet. Unfortunately, I lost my aunt last week and I wasn't exactly in the frame of mind to do any recording. This week, Nikki has lost her voice. Although she's feeling pretty good, she sounds like a teenage boy going through puberty. It's actually quite amusing.

It looks like we'll be delaying our recording session until she gets her voice back, hopefully by this weekend.

We're still here so keep checking back for the next REAL update. Thank you all for listening and for your support.

-Kim
