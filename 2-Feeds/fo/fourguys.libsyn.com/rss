			<title>Doing the Time Warp</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://fourguys.libsyn.com/doing-the-time-warp]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Hey folks!&nbsp; Do you feel like you've been doing the Time Warp the past few weeks?&nbsp; We sure do.&nbsp; (If you don't know what we're talking about, you really, really need to go see the <span>Rocky Horror Picture Show...</span> but not right now.&nbsp; Go see it at a theater.&nbsp; At midnight.&nbsp; And tell everyone there that you've never seen it before.&nbsp; Trust us.)<br/><br/>Anyway, our summer schedules are all over the place.&nbsp; Some of us have family camp obligations, others have trips, and so on.&nbsp; So our&nbsp;Four&nbsp;Guys... has often been and we've had&nbsp;difficulties getting the files moved around and uploaded in a timely manner ... you've been getting our weekly recorded show... less than weekly.</p>
<p>We're sorry.<br/><br/>Not just because we kind of sort of promised all of you a somewhat regular product.&nbsp; (&quot;Regular&quot; in the &quot;every week&quot; sense -- clearly not in any <span>other</span> sense!)&nbsp; but we value it ourselves.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We Shall stabilize our schedule, rest assured.</p>
<p>The upshot is, the newly posted&nbsp;episode (&quot;The bacon atom&quot;) is actually last week's episode... and there won't be an episode this week, because neither of the Guys who can record episodes is available.&nbsp; The overall frequency of episodes won't suffer, because we posted two last week (&quot;The Habanero Infusion&quot; and &quot;Hunny&quot;).&nbsp; Of course, we posted those because we were behind a little, but... well, like we said.&nbsp; Summer Happens.&nbsp; Craziness.<br/><br/>Anyway.&nbsp; The erratic schedule has been detected and will be handled.&nbsp; Enjoy the new one... and if you'd like... relive one from the archives.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Until next episode.... &quot;Stay cool&quot;.<br/><br/>– The Four Guys<br/></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Hey folks!&nbsp; Do you feel like you've been doing the Time Warp the past few weeks?&nbsp; We sure do.&nbsp; (If you don't know what we're talking about, you really, really need to go see the Rocky Horror Picture Show... but not right now.&nbsp; Go see it at a theater.&nbsp; At midnight.&nbsp; And tell everyone there that you've never seen it before.&nbsp; Trust us.)Anyway, our summer schedules are all over the place.&nbsp; Some of us have family camp obligations, others have trips, and so on.&nbsp; So our&nbsp;Four&nbsp;Guys... has often been and we've had&nbsp;difficulties getting the files moved around and uploaded in a timely manner ... you've been getting our weekly recorded show... less than weekly.
We're sorry.Not just because we kind of sort of promised all of you a somewhat regular product.&nbsp; (&quot;Regular&quot; in the &quot;every week&quot; sense -- clearly not in any other sense!)&nbsp; but we value it ourselves.&nbsp; 
We Shall stabilize our schedule, rest assured.
The upshot is, the newly posted&nbsp;episode (&quot;The bacon atom&quot;) is actually last week's episode... and there won't be an episode this week, because neither of the Guys who can record episodes is available.&nbsp; The overall frequency of episodes won't suffer, because we posted two last week (&quot;The Habanero Infusion&quot; and &quot;Hunny&quot;).&nbsp; Of course, we posted those because we were behind a little, but... well, like we said.&nbsp; Summer Happens.&nbsp; Craziness.Anyway.&nbsp; The erratic schedule has been detected and will be handled.&nbsp; Enjoy the new one... and if you'd like... relive one from the archives.&nbsp; 
Until next episode.... &quot;Stay cool&quot;.– The Four Guys
