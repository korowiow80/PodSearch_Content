    <description>


Food Is Not Love is talk comedy podcast. It's really very good, which is why you're here and about to listen. The show itself is taped in THE DIRTY ROTTEN SOUTH, although we don't pluke our sisters or make bongs out of chickens. This critically acclaimed PODCAST is hosted by Disco Volante from Brooklyn, N.Y and Robbie Danger from Atlanta, Georgia. Neither of them know how to dress themselves.

Bre Danger sits in as our in-studio guest. First up, we go over last week a little before we get to listener questions for cult movie icon, Tura Satana. After that, we head into Dirty Rotten Gossip town before Rob mysteriously launches us back to the year 1977. He&#8217;s clumsy. Our biggest fan Mike joins us for a ONE TIME ONLY segment called &#8220;Make Disco Cry.&#8221; After that, we&#8217;re all just a little tipsy as we were celebrating St. Patty&#8217;s a little early. </description>

Here&#8217;s why&#8230;

Disco and Rob discuss what they did on their week off. We then let all of you in on our secret plan for our next upcoming war. By the way, this is the episode features the mighty and triumphant return of THE DUNGEON OF ROCK featuring Andy Shernoff of the legendary band, The Dictators. As always, Chloe Jones returns and engages us in one of the most retarded news segments we&#8217;ve ever done.

The rest of the show is pretty much a free-fall of retardation that never hits rock bottom. Oh, and there&#8217;s a contest, where you can win a brand spankin&#8217; used DVD of Bring It On: In It To Win It!-signed by us!

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/22709/600x600_643246.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;On Reassignment: &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

Featuring the song-&#8220;Eyes In The Back Of My Head&#8221; performed by The Cliks. 


In this real screwed up Phish-concert of an episode-Disco flat out flees civilization-well, for a little while anyway. Robbie Danger then gives you his love advice before we bring on Lucas Silveira from the Canadian rock band-&lt;b&gt;THE CLIKS. &lt;/b&gt; 

During the news, we feature a very touching Human Interest story before Disco and Robbie&#8217;s new band, Tan Creedo, debut their new single-&#8220;SOUTH CAROLINA.&#8221; 

Oh! And Chloe does an editorial about old balls. 

We&#8217;re happy to have back &lt;b&gt;Lisa Timmons&lt;/b&gt; of socialitelife.com, bringing you another hilarious week of DIRTY ROTTEN GOSSIP!

After a break that must have put millions of lives on hold, the cast of FOOD IS NOT LOVE returns with a fierce vengeance! In this, our Thanksgiving episode, we&#8217;ve packed this show with tons of HOLIDAY GOODNESS.

We then talk to someone from Robbie&#8217;s hometown, who, is said to be preparing his local police force for the coming ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE! 

As always there is plenty if news, though this time there is a special DEMOCRATIC DEBATE EDITORIAL included. 

WE ARE ALSO PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THE RETURN OF DIRTY ROTTEN GOSSIP featuring our new gossip consultant, from A SOCIALITES LIFE.COM-

His rank disposition is the result of his YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS audition turning bust. Disco then speaks to 9/11 conspiracy debunker, and good friend of the show, &lt;b&gt;PAT CURLEY.&lt;/b&gt;

Robbie tells us another classic MATCH.COM story before revealing to the gang that he has discovered a podcast from Germany he feels may be ripping us off. 

This episode runs a little over an hour. That&#8217;s because there will be no show next week. However, we will be returning the following Sunday night-11/18.


Have a great couple of weeks, guys!

In this, our finest hour, Disco and Robbie remark on the water shortage in Atlanta, Georgia. This is news the American media is trying to keep suppressed! Not really, though.

Disco conducts a one on one interview with one of the most important figures in modern American history, Bev Harris. There is a documentary about this woman. That&#8217;s how awesome she is. We should note that the sound quality of the interview varies because the recording was done during one of the biggest electrical storms this city has ever seen! Not really, though. It was kind of a little storm, actually. Our sound board is held together with scotch tape. However, all of us here at FINL encourage you not to fast forward through this interview, as it is the one that we are the most proud of-warts and all.

As usual, we bring you a healthy dose of news coverage, combined with plenty of awful jokes at our producer&#8217;s expense. By the way, if you are Jewish, you may want to listen closely then by all means send your hate mail directly to Chloe. Her email address is:

ChloeJone@gmail.com

That is not a typo. Her ex-husband stole the last &#8220;S&#8221; in her name. Fucking gypsies. </description>
