			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a special edition of the Canine Nation podcast.  It&#8217;s longer than our usual podcasts and it&#8217;s features a couple of special guests.  We hope you enjoy it.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/roundtable1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1082" title="roundtable1" src="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/roundtable1-300x300.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" /></a>Petra Wingate is a great dog trainer.  She also happens to be my wife.  She has been teaching puppy and agility classes for the past few years.  Darcie Jennings is a great friend and has been training dogs and their owners through her CommuniCanine business for over 13 years.  As we often do, the three of us sat down to talk about dogs and dog training.  But this time, Petra decided to record it and also prepared some questions for us to discuss.</p>
<p>The result was a spirited discussion that lasted well over an hour and covered a lot of ground from essential behaviours to what makes us laugh about dogs.  We&#8217;ve edited down the first part for this podcast.  Not every trainer sees things the same way but in this case, we all challenge each other to be better and better.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening to Canine Nation podcasts. I hope you can spread the word and let your dog-friends know about what you&#8217;re hearing here. As always, your comments and suggestions are welcome!</p>

<p>Making your dog a more active participant in your training can make great things happen.  Giving them the freedom to try things doesn&#8217;t mean that they will be the &#8220;wrong&#8221; things.  Rewarding your dog for doing the things you like can lead to a great relationship and less trouble for both you and your dog!  Give it a try, catch your dog doing something right.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not hard to teach our dogs to do &#8220;tricks.&#8221;  They are, after all, just behaviours.  But how do you teach a dog to think about things like &#8220;bigger and smaller&#8221; or &#8220;closer or farther away&#8221;?  Our dogs have the capacity to learn such things and they do it every day.  What if we could engage that conceptual learning?  What might be possible if we trained beyond just behaviours?</p>

<p>Back when I was crossing over to positive training, it seemed like every time I turned around another technique I used to use was now a bad idea.  I had to keep running back to books or asking questions of positive trainers online to find appropriate alternatives.  But the answers were there and my new habits developed quickly.  But not as quickly as my relationship with my dogs improved!  It was well worth the extra work.</p>

<p>When I decided to re-think my approach to training my dogs, I wasn&#8217;t looking for a moral or ethical solution.  I was looking for a fast and easy change that wouldn&#8217;t involve a lot of expense and effort.  Imagine my surprise to find that positive training would give me more than I could have hoped for!</p>

<p>Change is difficult and frustrating and something most of avoid if at all possible.  My own life circumstances made reconsidering my dog training approach unavoidable.  But for most dog owners, what they have always done has always seemed to work.  Well enough, anyway, or at the very least it got results.  But what if you could get what you have now with half the effort?  What if you could change the way you worked with your dog and it made life better for you and your dog?  Would it be worth a little work now for an easier life later?  It&#8217;s up to you.  It&#8217;s seems an easy choice to me.</p>

<p>Books and articles can only take you so far.  You actually have to <em>do</em> the positive training with your dog in order to get good at it.  And who is the judge that you are improving as a trainer?  Why, your dog of course!  The faster and happier they learn, the better you are getting at teaching your dog.  If you make it fun, it&#8217;s an even better way to learn.</p>

<p>There are lots of websites out there that will tell you just how badly behaved your dog might be.  And most of them will happily tell you how to &#8220;correct&#8221; these signs of &#8220;aggression&#8221; and &#8220;dominance&#8221; to keep your dog from thinking he&#8217;s the &#8220;alpha&#8221; in your pack.  But you may have to agree to a price first.</p>
<p>The truth is, dogs are not pack animals.  They are domesticated companion animals bred by humans.  And those &#8220;warning signs&#8221; some web sites caution you about may just be natural behaviours or indicators of something totally different.</p>

<p>With all of the methods and information out there, this is a great time to try something new and learn something about our dogs.  Our dogs are wonderfully adaptable if we give them a chance.  There&#8217;s not harm in trying something we&#8217;ve never tried and it may work better than what we have been using!  Question everything and be prepared for some surprising answers.</p>

<p>The words and phrases we use when talking about dogs and training can influence our perceptions.  Sometimes our inner dialogues can work against us.  Are we being fair to our dogs and looking objectively at our own training skills?  It could be the difference between a good relationship and a GREAT relationship.</p>

<p>How we get our dogs to do the things we are trying to teach them matters.  There are lots of techniques to try and each will come with their own pros and cons.  I think it&#8217;s worth taking the time to look at how we go about teaching our dogs and make things as clear and easy for them to understand as possible.  Sometimes that means getting unnecessary or distracting actions or sounds out of the way so they can learn!</p>

<p>There can be other reasons dogs won&#8217;t take food such as anxiety, distraction, or arousal.  It&#8217;s best to make sure that a dog is within their tolerance for these things <em>before</em> attempting to train them or offer them food.  Failing to do so could create more problems than it solves.</p>

<p>Reinforcement and Rewards are not necessarily the same thing.  As trainers, we owe it to our dogs to know when we&#8217;re <em>trying</em> to train something and when we&#8217;re just rewarding them for being our dogs.  Both are important and both are in our control as trainers.</p>

I think the answer might be as surprising as it is simple! Decades of misunderstanding might give way to a more open and positive relationship with our dogs if we could change some of our assumptions about our dogs.  Too often we get stuck in our human-centric view of things and we fail to see the world from the our dog&#8217;s point of view.  If they could just tell is about 3 things, what would they be?  This is my guess.  I think I&#8217;m pretty close.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Pushy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-729" title="Pushy" src="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Pushy.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" /></a>Not so long ago, my enthusiasm for what I had learned about positive training and behavioural science turned me into an evangelist for modern training. But is pushing my training philosophy any more acceptable than pushing political or religious beliefs? Time has helped me temper my approach but the debate still rages within the positive training community. How far do we go to change the dog-owning world?  An even better question is how far to we go to maintain the &#8220;purity&#8221; of our positive training philosophies with other positive trainers?  This is a candid look at positive training, self-discovery, and the state of dog training in the current culture.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/start-finished.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-504" title="Sit!" src="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/start-finished-272x300.jpg" alt="Sit" width="272" height="300" /></a>Most dog owners make more or less effort to train their dogs.  If they are like me, they first learned to train dogs by rote.  By that I mean, you followed some particular recipe for getting the dog to do what you wanted and at some point it was &#8220;trained.&#8221;  As I&#8217;ve learned more about dogs and behaviour, it&#8217;s become clear to me that it isn&#8217;t quite that simple.  Those times when my dog didn&#8217;t perform as asked, he could have been distracted.  Or I could have been farther away than he was comfortable with or maybe the situation was just more stressful than normal and he didn&#8217;t feel comfortable.  What I know now is that you can train your do to work under a variety of conditions if you take the time to work at different levels of distraction, duration, and distance for each behaviour.  There are a lot of variables out there.  So are we ever &#8220;finished&#8221; training a particular behaviour?  Probably not.  It could always use a bit of sharpening.  Lucky for me, training my dog is something I enjoy very much and so does my dog.</p>
<p>My recommendation this week is the DVD &#8220;<a href="http://www.dogwise.com/itemdetails.cfm?ID=DTB863" target="_blank">The How Of Bow Wow &#8211; Building, Proofing And Polishing Behaviors</a>&#8221; by Virginia Broitman and Sherri Lippman.  It&#8217;s an informative and easy to use DVD by two great clicker trainers.  Sherri and Virginia use humor and a casual style to show you lots of great techniques to sharpen up your training skills.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/two-words.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-506" title="What?" src="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/two-words.jpg" alt="What?" width="300" height="279" /></a>Training our dogs can be fun and frustrating, both for us and our dogs.  Humans and dogs have very different responses when progress goes slowly or in an unexpected direction.  How we, as humans, respond to those frustrating moments can have a large impact on our dogs ability or willingness to learn.  Sometimes the best thing we can do to help our dogs learn during training is to be quiet, be still, and give them time to work out what we&#8217;re asking for.</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;m asking you to <strong>SPREAD THE WORD</strong> about Canine Nation.  The Canine Nation written articles can be found at: <a href="http://www.lifeasahuman.com/categories/pets/canine-nation" target="_blank">http://www.lifeasahuman.com/categories/pets/canine-nation</a>  and the podcasts can be found here at: <a href="http://www.caninenation.ca" target="_blank">http://www.caninenation.ca</a>  And don&#8217;t forget, the Canine Nation podcasts are also available at <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iTunes!</span></strong></p>
<p>If you know someone who would enjoy learning more about dogs, dog behaviour, or dog science, please let them know about Canine Nation.  It might be just the thing for those dog lovers in your life!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/defending.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-567" title="Defending" src="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/defending-199x300.jpg" alt="Defending" width="199" height="300" /></a>It wasn’t that long ago that the family dog was often a free-ranging rural or suburban dweller, happily spending his days exploring his fields or neighborhood. But as the times have changed, so has the role of the dog in our North American cultures.  Managing your dog when out in the world is just as important as training your dog to be a &#8220;good citizen.&#8221;  Sometimes we can&#8217;t anticipate all that the world can throw at our dogs and if they behave inappropriately, it could land you in serious trouble.  Your dog may even be taken away to be euthanised.  But there are lots of great ways you can protect your dog with a little common sense, the right equipment, and some vigilance.  We have to be prepared to defend our dog no matter what happens along the way.</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="http://lawvibe.com/dog-bite-law-top-7-ways-to-save-your-pet-from-euthanasia/" target="_blank">article I found on the Dog Bite Law website </a>on how to protect yourself and your dog from legal situations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/frustrated.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-569" title="Frustrated" src="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/frustrated-300x284.jpg" alt="Frustrated" width="300" height="284" /></a>Good communication with our dogs relies on positive reinforcement, consistency and fairness.  When that breaks down, our dogs can get frustrated with us.  They can&#8217;t be sure what we&#8217;re asking and they risk being scolded for not complying with our cues to them.  That frustration can take an emotional toll on our dogs.  How much or how little it can affect our relationship depends on a few different factors. Being observant and clear about what we are saying can save a lot of emotional wear and tear on your dog.  It will make you both happier too.</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;d like to recommend <a href="http://www.dogwise.com/itemdetails.cfm?ID=DTB968" target="_blank">For The Love Of A Dog</a> by Patricia McConnell. Like Patricia&#8217;s other works, it&#8217;s a very easy read and packed with lots of great information. It is thoroughly researched and will likely lead you to more great reading. The book looks at dogs and their emotions including how their body language can play a larger role than most dog owners realize. Check it out, it&#8217;s a great book!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/matchmaking.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-445" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="matchmaking" src="http://www.frivoli.com/caninenation/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/matchmaking.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="270" /></a>For some people, a new dog is no big deal.  You just bring it home and that&#8217;s it.  To others, it can be a wonderful adventure full of fun and learning and activities for both the human and the dog.  My friends Angela and Michael were looking forward with some excitement to getting their new puppy, whom they have named Castle.   Angela has been deep in learning about the latest training methods and behavioural science so she can teach young Castle all kinds of things.  The puppy&#8217;s breeder, Natalie Vivian, is also a friend and one of the best breeders of Belgian Shepherds I know about.  Natalie uses proven science to give all of her new puppies the best training from almost the day they are born so they are prepared to meet a big new world with no fear and lots of joy.  How great that these two found each other and how lucky for Castle to have such a great start in life!</p>

Audio edition of the article Adventures in Puppyhood: Tips for Matchmaking a New Dog from the Life As A Human online magazine website. You can visit Life a a Human to find this and other articles.

For some people, a new dog is no big deal.  You just bring it home and that&#039;s it.  To others, it can be a wonderful adventure full of fun and learning and activities for both the human and the dog.  My friends Angela and Michael were looking forward with some excitement to getting their new puppy, whom they have named Castle.   Angela has been deep in learning about the latest training methods and behavioural science so she can teach young Castle all kinds of things.  The puppy&#039;s breeder, Natalie Vivian, is also a friend and one of the best breeders of Belgian Shepherds I know about.  Natalie uses proven science to give all of her new puppies the best training from almost the day they are born so they are prepared to meet a big new world with no fear and lots of joy.  How great that these two found each other and how lucky for Castle to have such a great start in life!

<p>Humans like the affection of dogs. We find it reinforcing when they come to us for petting and attention. Once they find something that annoys us, they can be masters at using it to get us to do things in order get them to stop doing it. It’s cause and effect, consequences dictating behaviour. And they know it. As Jean Donaldson put it in her book Culture Clash, “Dogs do what works.” So who is training who in this relationship? The answer is probably both you and the dog. The good news is that it&#8217;s probably best that way!</p>
<p>This week I&#8217;m recommending a great book. &#8220;Reaching The Animal Mind&#8221; by Karen Pryor is a wonderful book about how and why training based on behavioural science works. Karen shares stories from her own life about training horses, goldfish, ferrets, and even humans with behavioural science in a fun and effective way. This book has received critical acclaim and comes highly recommended. It&#8217;s a great read! You can find it at <a href="http://www.dogwise.com/" target="_blank">the Dogwise online store</a> or at Amazon. It&#8217;s also probably at your local book store.</p>

What if we could communicate with dogs? It turns out that we can! And it&#039;s more amazing and more fun that we could ever have dreamed.
