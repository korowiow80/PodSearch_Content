        <itunes:summary><![CDATA[Radio Free Skaro is possibly the most popular, most prolific and charmingly irreverent (but never irrelevant) Doctor Who podcast around. Since August 2006, hosts Warren (in Vancouver, BC) and Steven (in Edmonton, AB) have provided listeners with their brand of amusing Doctor Who praise and punishment. A year later, Chris (in Amherst, NS) was added to the team, and The Three Who Rule were born.

Recommended by Doctor Who Magazine, Radio Free Skaro provides an entertaining and diverting listen for the diehard or casual Doctor Who fan. New episodes usually appear on Sundays, following a loose magazine format of the three hosts discussing the news and events of the past week in the worlds of Doctor Who, Torchwood, and the Sarah Jane Adventures. They have also recorded special commentary podcasts for classic series and new series episodes of Doctor Who along with interviews of some of the brightest of the Doctor Who luminaries. Radio Free Skaro is also the official podcast of Gallifrey One, the world’s largest and longest-running annual Doctor Who convention.]]></itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week's episode of Radio Free Skaro has unwittingly turned into a celebration of one-time Doctor Who producer Philip Hinchcliffe. Not only do the Three Who Rule provide commentary on the first Hinchcliffe story to air, 1975's iconic The Ark in Space, but it was also announced this past week that Hinchcliffe will be appearing at his first ever Gallifrey One convention in February of next year. So sit back and listen as we celebrate one of the finest eras in Doctor Who history that made the show an international success story.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Also, listen as we make fun of actors' hairstyles. Ah, it's Radio Free Skaro. What do you expect?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>With the furore and fascination of Eurovision now over with (oh, the excitement! The whimsy!), the Three Who Rule turn their gaze towards one of the most prolific directors in the new series, Euros Lyn, in this week's Miniscope. Lyn was credited with directing an astonishing eleven episodes across nine stories, including some stunning work on Tooth and Claw, and some questionable decisions on the David Tennant/RTD finale The End of Time. Also discussed in this week's podcast is Radio Free Skaro's upcoming appearance at Westercon 66 in July 2013, and some exciting news on the DVD front in the months to come.

This week, Steven and Chris postulate on the news that was, including a discussion on the wonderful Tales of Television Centre documentary that aired on BBC Four this past week, but all of the Three Who Rule are there to commentate over the final three episodes of Inferno, the 1970 Jon Pertwee classic.

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">It's a time of endings on this week's episode of Radio Free Skaro. Not only did the past week see the end of Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill in their roles as the Ponds, at least as far as filming goes, it also saw the end of the Upper Boat studio being the home of Doctor Who. To cap it all off, the Three Who Rule talk all over the first four episodes of Inferno, the last story to (prominently) feature the frankly awesome Liz Shaw. But it's also a time for new beginnings as the announcement of the Series 7 premiere is discussed. Every week that passes is one week closer to NEW! DOCTOR! WHO!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">It might sound like an overstatement, but writer/script editor Dennis Spooner was one of the most important figures in the history of Doctor Who. He essentially created what is now referred to the "pseudo-historical", introduced comedy into Doctor Who as a more prominent feature, and basically created the many mannerisms of the Second Doctor, the characterization that would go on to influence all subsequent versions of The Doctor. In order to fully pay homage to Spooner, the Three Who Rule are joined by writer Graeme Burk, whose encyclopedic knowledge of Doctor Who and deep insight into Spooner's work makes this an enjoyable listen. Also discussed are some DVD releases to come in the next few months. Four Canadians blathering about Doctor Who in one podcast: how can you go wrong?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">As a result of one of the lightest news weeks in recent memory in the worlds of Doctor Who, the Three Who Rule were allowed to devote their full attention to a commentary on Elisabeth Sladen's (first) finale in the classic series, namely 1976's "The Hand of Fear". Quarries, nuclear plants, Judith Paris in a sexy, skin tight rock costume, Rex Robinson's eyebrows - surely this story was a can't miss, epic conclusion to Sarah Jane Smith's tenure in the TARDIS, right? Well...at least there's that goodbye scene to look forward to, right? Also in this episode: a review of Michael E. Briant's upcoming memoir "Who is Michael E. Briant?", the classic Who director's collected memories of his time on Who and other TV shows of the day. Eldrad must live!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">One of the more maligned contributors to worlds of Doctor Who over the years has been musician Keff McCulloch. Responsible for the final variation of the Doctor Who theme for the classic series, "Deaf Keff" (as some have dubbed him) also provided incidental music for half of the stories of the Sylvester McCoy era. Did McCulloch's rampant use of sampling keyboards and predilection for digital handclaps invite a torrent of scorn from The Three Who Rule? McCulloch is the subject in this episode's Miniscope segment, and, with a bit of help from Luke from TMDWP, the Three try and delve into why they think Keff's music is so unpopular, while trying to decipher if they themselves agree with popular opinion.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>On the same weekend that The Doctor's Wife, along with The Girl Who Waited and A Good Man Goes To War, was nominated for a Hugo Award, it was fitting that we discuss the assorted works of that episode's director, Richard Clark, in the Miniscope. The Three Who Rule also give a good going over to the other three episodes that Clark helmed, namely Gridlock, The Lazarus Experiment, and Night Terrors, all the while comparing Clark to such diverse geniuses as Stanley Kubrick and George Martin. Also, a slow news week does at least contain some juicy tidbits about Series 7, which is currently going before the cameras in Cardiff. And just you wait to find out who we randomly draw for the next Miniscope...</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Three Who Rule enjoy another slow news week with excess meanderings, needlessly extending the length of this week's instalment... however a slow news week coupled with a Classic Series commentary is a good thing. The lads turn their gaze to talking over the *cough* David Agnew *cough* masterpiece City of Death, heralded by Doctor Who fans as one of the best stories of our beloved show. Or at least as the highlight of Season 17. Ribald jokes and insightful analyses are paired like a meal with a fine French wine as we wander the streets of Paris.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">After a couple of quiet weeks on the news front, we were treated to a bumper crop of topics worthy of discussion on this episode of Radio Free Skaro. Not only were we introduced to the next companion in the form of Jenna-Louise Coleman, but the official Doctor Who Convention in Cardiff gave us a new trailer for Series 7 and so much more, as told to us by our new friend Phil Cannon from the Who's He Podcast who attended the convention and had a grand time. And as if that wasn't enough, we present an interview with Graeme Burk and Robert Smith? about their new book Who Is The Doctor?, and top off the episode with a look at the works of Terrance Dicks in the Miniscope. The excitement for Series 7 is building. We hope we help you pass the time until then in an entertaining fashion!</p>

We've got an interview with "Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock" producer Simon Harris as well as the first foray back into the Classic Commentary Series with The Three Who Rule babbling overtop the first half of the Jon Pertwee story "The Mind Of Evil". Not all is rosy in the Whoniverse, however, as we also mourn the passing of Philip Madoc, an actor who brought many memorable roles to our beloved show. Now let's get the Keller outta here!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">After five and a half years of middling Doctor Who talk and wildly inaccurate discussion about the programme and those who create it, The Three Who Rule reach the amazing milestone of their 300th episode of Radio Free Skaro. It's been an epic ride from virtual obscurity for our first two years of existence to where we are today, and what better way to celebrate this event than the return of the Miniscope! In this instalment, we discuss the work of minor director Nicholas Mallett, whose Doctor Who output ranged from the very worst ("Paradise Towers") to the very best ("The Curse of Fenric"), and everything in between ("The Mysterious Planet"). Given Warren's rampant distaste for the Sylvester McCoy era, surely this will be a painful experience for him...or will it? This is the type of intrigue that has kept this show going for 300 episodes, and will push it into the future for at least a couple more.</p>

While the Three Who Rule briefly reminisce about the glory that was Gallifrey One's Network 23 in this episode of Radio Free Skaro, it's back to normal for podcaster and listener alike for the next few months - at least until next year's The 24 Hours of Gallifrey One, or y'know, until the new series of Doctor Who starts in the autumn. To help us get back into the swing of things, we present to you a commentary on the 2011 Doctor Who Christmas special, The Doctor, The Widow and The Wardrobe, as well as a smattering of news and views of what was missed while we were all living it up at Gally.</p>

First up, Ian Chesterton, Sir Ian, Knight of Jaffa himself, the amazing William Russell joins Steven and Ken Deep in reminiscing about what Doctor Who and TV production in general was like in the early days of the programme. Following that, An Unearthly Child and Marco Polo director Waris Hussein outlines his role in helping to create the longest running science fiction show ever. Fast forward three decades to the 1996 Fox TV Movie, the brainchild of Philip Segal, who discusses the many pitfalls that he encountered to get the 8th Doctor's only televised adventure brought to our screens. And finally, we catch up with friend of the show Phil Ford about aliens, wizards, and tequila. And stay tuned at the end to hear Radio Free Skaro's plans for the next few months while we wait for new Doctor Who!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Radio Free Skaro dives into history with Gallifrey 2012 guests starting with Louise Jameson, otherwise known as the beautiful savage Leela, Louise was an absolute delight to talk to about her tenure on the program and her many other roles, ranging from Shakespeare to soaps and everything in between. We went further back in time with Michael Troughton, the author of a new biography about his father, Patrick Troughton and then lurched forward again to speak with Richard Franklin, who played the redoubtable Captain Mike Yates. Ringing out the program was Charlie Ross, the comedian and preeminent nerd who kept all of Gallifrey laughing with his take on our favorite TV show. Finally, RFS closed out the proceedings with David and Marty Hooie of the "Hoo on Who" podcast, friends of the show and all-around fine chaps. Enjoy!</p>

Finally, RFS closed out the proceedings with David and Marty Hooie of the "Hoo on Who" podcast, friends of the show and all-around fine chaps. Enjoy!

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The annual meet up of Doctor Who podcasters at Gallifrey One forms the backbone of this, the first of Radio Free Skaro's episodes covering the convention. Among our friends joining us is Simon Harries, late of Tachyon TV and attending his first Gally since 2010, and Josh Zimon, long time listener and now first time guest representing, along with Eric Escamilla, the Mostly Harmless Cutaway podcast. Topics discussed were the differences in popularity of Doctor Who in North America and in the UK, how Gallifrey One stands out among the many other Doctor Who conventions in the USA and in the United Kingdom, and the usual tales of ribaldry that occurs at such events and pushes the PG-13 boundaries that this podcast tries desperately to somewhat casually enforce. Enjoy, and stay tuned throughout the rest of the weekend for more episodes to come!</p>

<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">Our annual tradition is to run through the convention schedule before we arrive, glossing over panels that we know nothing about (cosplay, crafts, Buffy fandom and&nbsp; Gay Agendas) and lionizing panels we think are cool (Steve Roberts, stuff we're moderating, podcasting chinwags, and Steve Roberts.) While we strive to inform and entertain, Gally guests are well advised to check out both the website at www.gallifreyone.com and read their program guide upon arrival, which will soon become your Holy Text as you navigate past Tiki Daleks and Femmy Sixes.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>At long last, Radio Free Skaro's time-filling series of Series 6 commentaries comes to an end with the Three Who Rule talking over "The Wedding of River Song". They manage to keep vaguely on topic, perhaps a tough task given their general ennui towards the Series 6 finale which contained so many twists and turns that everything pretty much wrapped up where it was expected to. Still, a good time was had by all, and with the commentaries now done, the countdown officially begins toward the greatest show on earth - Gallifrey One.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p style="margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica;">A simple commentary about "Closing Time," which gave the Three Who Rule ample time to discuss the great chemistry between Matt Smith and guest star James Corden, instead devolved into a simply rancid discussion on babies and their propensity to poop on this episode of Radio Free Skaro. Our choice of topic says more about us than it does about the episode at hand, which was a delightful romp penned by Gareth Roberts and not at all a treatise on infants and their digestive habits. But leaving the puerile giggling aside for the moment, weighty matters as fictitious awards, possibly crappy video games and the life and quick death of Doctor Who Insider were also covered. All this and backhanded compliments aimed at Eric Roberts, and you've got yourself approximately an hour of a podcast of some sort!</p>

As Gallifrey One's official podcast, we'll open the convention and will be joined on stage by actress Camille Coduri, director Toby Haynes, jack-of-all-trades Barnaby Edwards and jack-of-even-more-trades Gary Russell. The Three Who Rule also cast their gaze, commentary-wise, upon Tom MacRae's amazing The Girl Who Waited to see if it stands the test of time. And of course there's the news gnashing.

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Despite January usually being a lean time for news of things Who, this week was chock full of factoids and quasi-related marginalia for the Three Who Rule to ponder and prognosticate upon. Of course all seriousness went out the window with a commentary on "Night Terrors," which such weighty matters discussed as watching Battlestar Galactica (the old one) and Star Wars (the old, good one) on French television, lack of consistency in doll house detailing, and of course the...nutritional habits of a young man/alien named George. Truly riveting listening.&nbsp;</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Despite January usually being a lean time for news of things Who, this week was chock full of factoids and quasi-related marginalia for the Three Who Rule to ponder and prognosticate upon. Of course all seriousness went out the window with a commentary on "Night Terrors," which such weighty matters discussed as watching Battlestar Galactica (the old one) and Star Wars (the old, good one) on French television, lack of consistency in doll house detailing, and of course the...nutritional habits of a young man/alien named George. Truly riveting listening.&nbsp;

            <description><![CDATA[<p>With just a week to go until the 2011 Doctor Who Christmas Special, the Three Who Rule cast their eyes back to a simpler time, before River Song was related to the Ponds and when a baby could turn into a puddle of goo and still be broadcast pre-watershed. Yes, "A Good Man Goes to War" was our commentary this week, with all the usual off-topic and off-color discussion you've come to know and somewhat tolerate. Add chatter of our live show at Gallifrey 2012 (two months from now!), news of departing companions, Season 7's structure, and Fendahl action figures, and you've got yourself a podcast!&nbsp;</p>

Such things include an interview with Peter Davison, an RFS first, even if he's Doctor the Fifth. Of course it wouldn't be an episode of Radio Free Skaro without the usual news, sardonic analysis and nerdery. Enjoy!</p>

The Doctor's Wife gets the commentary treatment, and - short story even shorter - it's just as well-loved this time around as when we first saw it half a year ago. Also, as we start to gear our brains toward conventions such as Chicago TARDIS and Gallifrey One, we sink our teeth into some details about the recently-announced official convention.

River Song getting hitched! &ldquo;The Wedding of River Song&rdquo; had it all, including a moving tribute to the Brig.

Stats, toys, t-shirts, expensive scale models of Matt Smith&hellip;.and baseless Cybermat Roomba speculation round out this, the last Radio Free Skaro dealing with new Who until December 25th.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Doctor Who is back! After what seemed equally both a long summer and a short summer, Doctor Who has returned to our screens with Let's Kill Hitler -- and of course the Three Who Rule were all over the episode to deliver their review. But wait, there's more! Torchwood is still making its way toward the end of Miracle Day, so of course the lads throw in their two cents about End of the Road. What do they think about these new offerings from the Whoniverse? Lastly, along with the usual news and stats, we also speak with Doctor Who Brand Manager Edward Russell about his upcoming Walk for Lis!</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[With less than a week to go until New! Doctor! Who! The Three Who Rule delved into the distant past via the works of Brian Hayles, creator of the Ice Warriors, Luddite, and gentleman scholar, in what will likely be the last Miniscope for quite some time. Of course it wouldn&rsquo;t be RFS without the latest news, analysis, and off-color banter about Rory in a Roman outfit, all of which were copiously present.

            <link><![CDATA[http://freyburg.libsyn.com/doctor-who-radio-free-skaro-249-cary-on-tristram]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in what seems like a very long while, the Three Who Rule tackle a Miniscope segment all on their own without the aid of a special (and probably much better informed) guest. The subject? Musician Tristram Cary, whose moody melodies and bouncy ballads helped underscore many a 1960s Doctor Who serial. Even the most taciturn of individuals could find something to say about Cary's iconic work. And if that wasn't enough to fill an episode, there's a bundle of press launch news from both sides of the Atlantic to help form another jam packed, spoiler-free episode of Radio Free Skaro.</p>

To help in the discussion (or basically lead), Radio Free Skaro&rsquo;s own GetGlue guru Emily Kausilik, a noted music expert in her own right, was brought in to offer her expertise on not only Kay&rsquo;s music, but how music in general was composed and used in 1960s Doctor Who.

As well, news hit the wire we'll be getting a little extra Who in the form of prequel mini-episodes for a few Series 6 stories. Such an occasion always attracts guests, so Luke from TMDWP drops in to share his two cents, while also ably aiding the Three Who Rule in slicing, dicing and dissecting the Doctor Who career of director Richard Martin. Martin directed several early Hartnell stories, but whether he directed them well or not was the main point of the discussion...</p>

Instead of the subject being chosen randomly, musician Peter Howell&rsquo;s work was specifically chosen for discussion, and instead of a discussion, why not interview the man himself? So, in tandem with Dr. Phillip Serna of Adventures in Time, Space, and Music, Steven got to talk to one of his early musical heroes about his many varied scores for Doctor Who from 1980-1985. Also, news and many fact corrections from the week before. What fun!</span></p>

The highs from Gallifrey came crashing down as the news of Courtney&rsquo;s death hit earlier in the week, and it was only fitting that a Courtney tribute episode be recorded. We welcomed Doctor Who script editor, New Adventures author and Doctor Who Magazine editor, Big Finish producer and life-long Doctor Who fan Gary Russell on the show to reminisce about his experiences with the wonderful Mr. Courtney. Please join us as we remember Sir Alastair Gordon Lethbridge-Stewart, the man who portrayed him as well as cover the news of the week.</span></p>

A look at controversial writer/script editor Eric Saward rounds out the show with some great discussion of his influence and reach, along with the selection of next week's miniscope subject... and just who will that be?</p>

As those familiar with the sound design of Doctor Who are aware, Mills is the most-credited person on the show thanks to his long tenure with the Radiophonic Workshop. Where to begin? What to discuss? The only answer was to bring in a ringer in the form of Radiophonic Workshop archivist and Doctor Who composer in his own right, Mark Ayres. Settle in with your Doctor Who sound effects LP, a nice hot beverage, and join not one but two special guests in this episode of Radio Free Skaro as we also have Chip from the Two-minute Time Lord sit in Warren&rsquo;s seat for some tantalizing nerdery.</span></p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://freyburg.libsyn.com/radio-free-skaro-229-with-a-little-help-from-my-friends]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>The stream of commentaries that the Three Who Rule have been unleashing upon the world for the past several months finally concludes with their real-time review of the Series 5 finale The Big Bang. And what an episode to go out on, all three were as admiring of the story as they were when it first went out in June and nothing has changed in the mean time. Also of note, this is Warren's last episode from China, a nation whose internet connection is almost as dodgy as its human rights record. Next week: new Doctor Who in the form of A Christmas Carol. And we can't wait, either.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>The Pandorica Opens was the focus of most of this episode of Radio Free Skaro, thanks to a light news week. Good thing, too, as Pandorica was another triumph from Series 5, featuring many power mad conspirators - Daleks, Sontarans, Cybermen - gathering together to fight their greatest enemy, The Doctor. Such a visual feast put the Three Who Rule in danger of becoming transfixed on what they were watching, but they managed to mostly steer clear of the silence for the time being. Ah, yes. The Silence. More on that next week...</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>For the first time in many months, the Three Who Rule were delighted to welcome Tachyon TV's Neil Perryman back into the fold to not only discuss the week that was in Doctor Who, but to be present for Neil's first commentary since watching &lt;em&gt;The Stolen Earth&lt;/em&gt; 27 times in one weekend to prepare the last ever Tachyon TV commentary podcast. The episode in question is Gareth Roberts' &lt;em&gt;The Lodger&lt;/em&gt;, episode 11 of Series 5. As usual with Neil, the boundaries of decency for Radio Free Skaro were pushed ever further, as was the level of integrity and humour. A good time was had by all!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It was a banner week for Doctor Who leading up the programme's 47th anniversary celebrations on November 23, with massive news on both sides of the Atlantic in the forms of a new trailer for A Christmas Carol, a same-day broadcast date in the US, and Matt Smith's landmark appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. All of these events and more were discussed at great length by the Three Who Rule, amongst other notable topics (including Ian Levine's Shada), capped off by a rollicking commentary on the Series 5 episode "Cold Blood". Enjoy, and Happy Birthday, Doctor Who!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: #63565f; line-height: 16px;">The Series 5 commentary series resumes this week with a look at the latter half of the stellar return of the Weeping Angels, &ldquo;Flesh and Stone&rdquo;. Instead of stunned silence, though, which one might expect to occur when watching something as entrancing as this, the Three Who Rule instead descended into heated arguments about Battlestar Galactica and the debatable merits of rock operas. One thing that they could all agree on, though, is that The Time of Angels and Flesh and Stone are fine examples of some of the best television ever made.</span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The Series 5 commentary series resumes this week with a look at the latter half of the stellar return of the Weeping Angels, &ldquo;Flesh and Stone&rdquo;. Instead of stunned silence, though, which one might expect to occur when watching something as entrancing as this, the Three Who Rule instead descended into heated arguments about Battlestar Galactica and the debatable merits of rock operas. One thing that they could all agree on, though, is that The Time of Angels and Flesh and Stone are fine examples of some of the best television ever made.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 11px;">After taking the better part of September off to either move to, visit, or stay away from other continents, the Three Who Rule reconvened for their first regularly recorded episode of Radio Free Skaro since the hazy days of summer. And, lo! What a news list to come back to! Some old, most older, but all entirely relevant, otherwise it would have never been mentioned in the first place. And to top it off, there's a commentary on perhaps the best New Series episode made to date, "The Time of Angels". If you're going to listen to one episode of Radio Free Skaro, make it this one!

            <description><![CDATA[The Two Who Rule (Chris was consumed by a Weeping Angel and sent back in time to 1973) were effusive in their praise of one of the best episodes not only of this season but of Doctor Who’s storied history, lauding both Matt Smith for his great performance and Steven Moffat for one of the scariest episodes in recent memory. Without Chris, the Two Who Rule were unable to effectively slag RTD (though they tried) or dismiss David Tennant’s contributions to the program (perish the thought!) though they did their best to not slip into a coma while discussing ratings.

            <description><![CDATA[The Three Who Rule were joined by Neil from Hartlepool (and Tachyon TV, tangentially) to celebrate the return of Doctor Who to our screens and to fete the debut of Karen Gillan,&nbsp;Matt Smith, and showrunner Steven Moffat in their respective roles of awesome, awesomer and awesomest. There was much discussion of “The Eleventh Hour,” which other than an atrocious new theme tune (and lack of a McCoy era sex wink) was deemed near perfect. All that and news, tomfoolery and a very strange extra feature on the upcoming Planet of Fire DVD round out this episode of RFS. Geronimo.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[On this special Gallifrey edition of Radio Free Skaro, we delve deep into the dark underbelly of Doctor Who, first in a discussion with writer Tony Lee and artist Matthew Dow Smith about the new Tenth and Eleventh Doctor comics coming soon from IDW Publishing, and second, (and far more sinister) the 2010 Podcast Summit, where the evil practitioners of the dark art held forth on their methods and madness.

Stay tuned all this week for daily podcasts, special guests and the most fun you can legally have involving Doctor Who and cast of thousands (well, a thousand and change.) Not all was silent from The Beeb this week, however, as the start date for Series Fnarg has been announced for April 3 on BBC One, hot on the heels of the new trailer for Matt Smith's debut run.</p>

Did the episode fare better this time round after the scolding it received in Radio Free Skaro 174? You decide. Also discussed was news of Gaiman, gay men, and gained men, er, companions.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[It's the End of Time and the end of an era, and the Three Who Rule were all over the map in their praise and derision of David Tennant and RTD's swan song. One thing they all did agree on was their palpable excitement over Matt Smith's new Doctor and Steven Moffat's upcoming stewardship of Doctor Who, and that it'll be a long few months indeed before Spring 2010.

            <description><![CDATA[So it&#8217;s come to this. More than a year after David Tennant announced he was leaving the role of the Doctor, through endless speculation, theorizing and fanwank, we&#8217;ve finally reached the Tenth Doctor&#8217;s penultimate adventure, and&#8230;.the results are not good. In fact, they&#8217;re disastrous. The Three Who Rule were moved to anger, bile, and sadness at Russell T. Davies constant and unnecessary need to oudo himself, at The Master&#8217;s penchant for leaping and lightning, exacerbated by the fact that all three of your august hosts were in the same room at the same time. In fact, there may have been a monkey knife fight, you&#8217;ll just have to listen to find out. Allons-sigh.

            <description><![CDATA[With TV viewers in Canada and the US now caught up with the rest of the world regarding The Waters of Mars, the time was right for the Radio Free Skaro team to provide a running commentary on the recent masterpiece bestowed upon us by Graeme Harper, Russell T Davies, and (friend of the show) Phil Ford. Main points of discussion during the commentary were the unparalleled acting skills of David Tennant, the talents of directorial master Graeme Harper, and why it&#8217;s so difficult to find a timepiece that accurately measures rels.

But hope and glory came in the form of Malcolm Clarke, the first musician to grace the Miniscope (yes, it&#8217;s back, at least temporarily) and an underrated craftsman in the world of Classic Who. Synthesizers from 1972 and marching Cyberman themes ahoy!

We hope you enjoy this unique celebration.

The Three Who Rule were effusive in their praise of WoM, though somewhat less so when the conversation came to the latest episodes of the Sarah Jane Adventures, which Chris (also known as &#8220;Curmudge-or&#8221;) succinctly labeled as &#8220;poop&#8221;. The trio even discussed how Steven somehow managed to get onto UK radio last week and participate in a conference call with David Tennant. Intellectual banter and relentless name-dropping ahoy!

Some good news (Doctor Who confirmed for Christmas and a Children in Need Preview of Tennant's penultimate episode) was discussed as was some bad news (various bits of DVD-related disappointments) whilst opinions were split down the middle on the latest installment of The Sarah Jane Adventures (quite a tough thing to do with an odd number of participants). David Whitaker gets quite the workout in the miniscope, complete with a Vampire/Halloween tie-in, and Steven finally commits to an appearance on Luke's Doctor Who-based Mastermind quiz!]]></description>

David Whitaker gets quite the workout in the miniscope, complete with a Vampire/Halloween tie-in, and Steven finally commits to an appearance on Luke's Doctor Who-based Mastermind quiz!]]></itunes:subtitle>

Was Sarah Jane worthwhile viewing? Will Doctor Who fandom become collective paupers from the deluge of early 2010 DVD releases? Will Chris Clough get the tongue lashing so many think he deserves in this week's Miniscope? Delve into this week's gripping episode to find out!<br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Doctor Who world lost one of its indisputable titans on October 9, 2009, when Barry Letts passed away at the age of 84. Letts was a director, writer, executive producer, and, most notably, producer of Doctor Who from 1970-1974. He was also one of the greatest ambassadors that the programme has ever known. In this episode, actor/comedian and noted fan and unofficial historian of Doctor Who, Toby Hadoke, was kind enough to join us to help us celebrate the legacy of the great Barry Letts.

News, digressions and a visit from one of the Internet's most pervasive memes round out this most 150-th of episodes. Play him off, Keyboard Cat!

            <description><![CDATA[In a noteworthy Wednesday cutaway, Radio Free Skaro enlisted the help of some of our LGBT listeners to hold a discussion on the recent uproar about Torchwood: Children of Earth (about which there will be spoilers!) and the perceived homophobia many in the fandom community say it presented. Many thanks go to our own Katrina who leads the panel with listeners Erik and Nat in delivering an hour of informed discussion about this fandom reaction.

            <description><![CDATA[In a stunning, nay flabbergasting turn of events, the Torchwood: Children of Earth miniseries turned out to be not only a fantastic five days of entertainment but possibly one of the best things on television thus far this year. A special 4 person quorum of the RFS council was called to deal with this turn of events, with special Torchwood representative Katrina joining the fun. But that's not all! The Three Who Rule Plus One also threw in a Bad Wolf commentary...but of course such good fortune meant the beast Cracklor also paid a visit. Still, an epic-length RFS for an epic entry in the Doctor Who canon.

Oh, and somewhere in this menagerie of madness the sometimes forgotten but certainly notable Boom Town was commented on by the Three Who Rule.

The Two of the Three compare the nascent Mr. Smith's ascension with the oncoming of past Doctors of yore and ultimately conclude it's far too early to know what to expect from this whippersnapper.

to Chris and Steven to hash out their opinions of the recent Doctor Who

Warren wasn't weird enough, both Chris and Steven were actually in the

find time to comment on Survivors, Coronation Street and Canada's

much potential, frittered away in a fruitless wasting of the Rose story
arc and Benny Hill-esque dispatchment of the Daleks. Still, Julian
Bleach's Davros and the sad fate of Donna Noble rescued the episode
from the Trash-Bin of Utter Contempt (next door neighbour to the Gun of

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Steven and Warren braved the depths of mediocrity in order to bring you &quot;The Doctor's Daughter,&quot; one of the lesser lights of Season Four. But after six months since our original viewing, it must be said that David Tennant rises to the occasion and puts in some first-rate acting in an otherwise fourth rate story. Brace yourselves and listen, chums. ]]></itunes:subtitle>

Though precious little was actually aid about the episode at hand, Warren did manage to transfigure the Sontaran war cry into OBAM-HA! surely a new rallying cry for these final days of the American election campaign. <br/><br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The dark times begin as we enter a solid half year with no new Who, but
the august crew at Radio Free Skaro have ably responded to this gulf in
quality televisual spectacle with a new series of Classic series
commentaries, beginning (sort of) with Black Orchid, a Davison
two-parter done on the cheap and set in the 1920s. Sarcasm and japes,
anyone?]]></description>

downhill...and they did! The Three Who Rule were unsparing in their
criticism of a finale episode that had its moments but seriously
underwhelmed. Still, that didn't stop Warren, Steven and Chris from
staying mostly on topic and ranting about what will be the last bit of
new Who for quite some time. Next week, a Black Orchid commentary, take

And, as threatened last week, we actually did a commentary for &quot;The Brain of Morbius&quot;, one of Tom Baker's more violent excursions from the classic series. This is by far the longest RFS we've ever done, so let us know by telegraph, carrier pigeon or new-fangled electronic mail if we've jumped the shark or whether you'd like to hear more of our extended ramblings on the Classic Series (which, given the semi-hiatus next year, you surely will in one form or another.)<br/><br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

The Third Guy's (momentary) visit to Edmonton meant a clear signal not muddled by Transatlantic cables or time zone hijinks, but near the end of the podcast Chris managed to slip into a space-time wormhole and only just survived by hanging onto his wireless connection by the skin of his fingernails.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Mystery, pathos, and some seriously freaky looking spaghetti mouthed Oods...not a bad episode this week, according to the RFS crew. The Third Guy's (momentary) visit to Edmonton meant a clear signal not muddled by Transatlantic cables or time zone hijinks, but near the end of the podcast Chris managed to slip into a space-time wormhole and only just survived by hanging onto his wireless connection by the skin of his fingernails. Still, japes all round and a fine time was had by all. And next week, the Sontarans return! ]]></itunes:subtitle>

Along the way we discussed much news, reviewed the newest Sarah Jane Adventure, and tried to figure out if the rumours of Peter Davison donning his old costume and joining with David Tennant for the upcoming Children in Need special were in fact true, only to have the BBC confirm it mere moments after our podcast.

            <description><![CDATA[A truly momentous milestone, as we celebrate our 50th episode of Radio Free Skaro with...well, nothing really. Nothing, that is, except a corking bit of episode-ery known as &quot;Human Nature,&quot; one of the highlights of Season 3. Join Warren, Steven, and Chris (otherwise known as the Third Guy) as they expostulate on the fine craftwork and Edwardian elegance of the first portion of Paul Cornell's masterwork.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Steven, Warren and the supremely jaunty Chris tackle 42, a madcap romp through a spaceship hurtling towards a dying sun, for this the 49th episode of Radio Free Skaro. We also tackle the recent announcement of a &quot;gap year&quot; for the series involving three specials in 2009, along with confirmation of the fourth and fifth series. And of course we ramble off-topic as usual about matters of great import. ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The Third Guy returns as Chris Burgess joins us once again for our take on &quot;The Lazurus Experiment&quot;, a Seaon 3 time-filler redeemed by cool scorpion effects and the fact that it came right after a disastrous Dalek two-parter. We went pretty far off-topic in this one, even breaching the shores of the dreaded Coronation Street (at length), but hopefully our jib-jabber will prove somewhat entertaining nonetheless. ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[The episode under fire in our commentary may be nothing to write home about, but this week's episode of Radio Free Skaro was indeed special in that it included Chris Burgess, our perennial silent partner and Fifth Beatle. Chris threw in his two bits on Evolution of the Daleks (three guesses as to how he felt about this snoozefest) and managed to inspire awe and fright in both Warren and Steven with his vast and sinister knowledge of all things Whovian. ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Warren and Steven tear into what was definitely the lowlight of the season, Daleks in Manhattan, which had all the potential for greatness but failed to live up to its promise every step of the way. At least it gave us ample ammunition for slagging during our commentary, which we did with great relish and abandon. We also cover bits and pieces of news, including the as of yet unconfirmed (but oh so tasty) rumour that Ben Kingsley might play Davros in Season 4.  ]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[One of our favorites from Season Three goes under the microscope as Warren and Steven subject &quot;Gridlock&quot; to their witty, nay brilliant commentary. We also veered off into a few other topics off the top, including &quot;Life on Mars&quot; (which Warren is watching and quite enjoying, thank you very much) and the differences between the look of British and American TV. Fore more detail on that subject, check out the discussion on Metafilter, found here:

But it was either re-record everything (not an option at this late hour, and our schedule won't allow another time to record for the rest of the week) or just go with it and beg forgiveness. So we throw ourselves at the mercy of you, our fans, and remind you that we do this show for free. :)

Anyway, we jabbered on about Lat of the Time Lords, which was not so good, as well as took a look at the season as a whole and up and coming news regarding season 4. Next up, Episode 42 (two weeks hence, Steven is a busy man) where we'll look at Douglas Adams contribution to both Who and the culture as a whole. Sorry about the echo. Sorry. ]]></description>

We also discuss next week's &quot;Blink,&quot; and the inevitable finale to the season, which is sure to be a masterly set of episodes (heh). ]]></description>

Great effects, imaginative characters, humor and some genuinely moving moments make for one of the best bits o' Who in the new series. Lovely! Next week, the Daleks invade Manhattan, as does Warren. We'll probably skip the podcast next week and double up to cover both Dalek episodes at once. ]]></description>

We lay down our thoughts on the show (hint: we liked it), new companion Martha Jones, various bits of ancillary promotion for the show, and our rampant speculation as to the nature of upcoming episodes, based on the tin fragments of scenes we've been spoon-fed thus far.

            <description><![CDATA[My erstwhile co-host Steven will disagree with me, but I think Sylvester McCoy's era was the low ebb of the classic series before it triumpantly retuned decades later. Join us as we argue, cajole, and fail to convince each other that the seventh Doctor's adventures were a bold new step for the show, or a pile of unwatchable junk. ]]></description>

Also notable is the fact that I set up a new way of recording the podcast, resulting in much better sound quality. That is, until the end, when &quot;Doctor in Distress&quot; will scar both your ears and your soul. ]]></description>

To start with we naturally picked the first Doctor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hartnell">William Hartnell</a>, and we managed to squeeze (amazingly) 45 minutes of discussion out of his pioneering tenure in the role.

            <description><![CDATA[Our 11th episode, a review of &quot;Cyber-Woman,&quot; the unimaginatively named but nonetheless quite decent episode of Torchwood featuring a sexy cyberlady smashing things and generally causing strife and havoc. We also once again verr wildly off course, discussing my night job taking pictures of celebrities, the weather, Monty Python, and a plethroa of other trivia, some of it even Who-related. Steven also relays how he'll be spending his Novermber 23rd, the 43rd anniversary of Classic Who. (Hint: it will be somewhat nerdy.)]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Our 11th episode, a review of &quot;Cyber-Woman,&quot; the unimaginatively named but nonetheless quite decent episode of Torchwood featuring a sexy cyberlady smashing things and generally causing strife and havoc. We also once again verr wildly off course, discussing my night job taking pictures of celebrities, the weather, Monty Python, and a plethroa of other trivia, some of it even Who-related. Steven also relays how he'll be spending his Novermber 23rd, the 43rd anniversary of Classic Who. (Hint: it will be somewhat nerdy.)]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <description><![CDATA[Episode 10 is up, and we discuss &quot;Ghost Machine,&quot; the latest episode of Torchwood, which features not only a star of the old series masterpiece &quot;The Caves of Androzani,&quot; but also a nearly unrecognizable Gareth Thomas from Blake's 7. We also veer wildly off-topic and discuss the CBC, Zed, and the questionable usefulness of HDTVs. ]]></description>

Much gushing about the Impossible Planet and Satan pit two-parter, some kvetching about DVD vendors and their lack of Who respect, and formative plans for a live episode in a couple of weeks time, as I will be in Edmonton over the weekend.

            <description><![CDATA[Again with the technical difficulties! First we had a file up and die on us, then Steven's microphone generated a truly astounding amount of hum. Through it all we soldiered on, and now bring you the delayed but complete Radio Free Skaro, episode 4. We discuss the Girl in the Fireplace and the first Cybermen two-parter, then veer wildly off course and talk about webisodes, the Internet, and why there won't be any new Gallifrey episodes (and whether or not that's a good thing). At any rate, thanks for waiting and putting up with our technical troubles, and hope you all enjoy the podcast. We'll try to get #5 out sometime this weekend.
