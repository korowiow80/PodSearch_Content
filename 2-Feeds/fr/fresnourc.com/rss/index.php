						<title>Ascending Beyond Canaan (LD 18; Psalm 68)</title>
						<pubDate></pubDate>
						<itunes:subtitle>LD 18; Psalm 68 (www.fresnourc.com)</itunes:subtitle>
						<itunes:summary> I know that when I summarize the work of Christ I speak of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ.  I guess that I have indoctrinated myself into think that those three things are the most essential things for the gospel of Christ to be true.  So, I wonder why I and many other Christians do not say, &quot;life, death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ.&quot;  Why is it so easy for Christians to leave out the blessing of the ascension of Christ?   Do we see the ascension of Christ as a blessing?  If you are curious about these questions please stay tuned to our sermon titled, &quot;Ascending Beyond Canaan.&quot;</itunes:summary>

						<itunes:subtitle>John 1:35-51 (www.fresnourc.com)</itunes:subtitle>
						<itunes:summary>One of my favorite stories is Jacob&apos;s ladder in Genesis 28.  I cannot tell you how many times I read that story and catch myself thinking that I have really been shorted a great Christian experience because I have never had such a vision.  Yet, when we turn to John&apos;s gospel it is almost like he rebukes such a mindset that what Jacob had was better than what I have in Christ.  How can having Christ be better than the vision of the angels ascending and descending on the great tower?  If you are curious about these questions please stay tuned to our sermon titled, &quot;The Messianic Tower.&quot;

						<itunes:summary>Christ&apos;s resurrection from the dead is probably one of the biggest stumbling blocks of Christianity.  You see if we do not talk about the dead being raised then Christianity is more believable.  Why is the bodily resurrection of Christ so essential for our faith?  Is the bodily resurrection of Christ only significant for our faith or is it significant even for the Old Testament saints?  Can we find a hope and assurance of the resurrection even in the Old Testament?

						<itunes:summary>John is the one who goes before Christ to announce that the Christ is here.  When you look at the other gospels they say that John is one who is Elijah, but yet in John&apos;s gospel John denies that he is Elijah.  Why does John deny this identity?  Why does John refer to Christ as the lamb of God?  Most of all why do we care about John&apos;s ministry?  I mean we have the Christ so what purpose does he serve in scripture?

						<itunes:subtitle>LD 16; Psalm 18 (www.fresnourc.com)</itunes:subtitle>
						<itunes:summary>The words, &quot;And He descended into hell&quot; are some of the words that have had way too much ink spilled on their meaning.  The Heidelberg Catechism does a wonderful job of summing up the significance of these words by saying, &quot;That in my greatest temptations, I may be assured [that Christ] has delivered me from the anguish and torments of hell.&quot;  Why do I think those words are so encouraging?  Why does this seem to be such an adequate summation of the benefit of Christ&apos;s suffering?

						<itunes:summary>I think that if we are honest as Christians we have a Hollywood picture of heaven.  We think that we sit on a cloud playing the harp and maybe eating grapes wondering what to do next.  Heaven appears to be a rather boring retirement.  So, we do not want to go, and besides it seems that sometimes God appears finicky and impatient. So, is this really the impression that Joel want to leave when he talks about heaven and the Day of the Lord?  If heaven is a boring retirement then why does John conclude scripture with his prayer, &quot;Come quickly Lord Jesus?&quot;  If you are curious about these questions please stay tuned to our sermon titled, &quot;Longing for Zion.&quot;</itunes:summary>

						<itunes:summary> When we think about the work of Christ it is almost cliche among Christians to say that Christ has suffered.  He has suffered, but why is that important?  This is a question that I think we take for granted because if we are honest we expect life to go well for us as we faithfully follow the Lord.  However, how is this expectation for a blessed life working for King David who most likely wrote Psalm 22?  Does his life always go well as he serves the Lord?

						<itunes:summary> I hope that we would all agree that God is Almighty.  If you think about what it means to come before an Almighty God this is something that could be terrifying. This is the God who wiped out nations, and made a little nomadic people great.  So, since this is true, can we come boldly before the throne of God?  On what basis can we come boldly before the throne of God?  Do we have any hints from the Psalms showing us how to be bold before the Lord?  If you are curious about these questions please stay tuned to our sermon titled, &quot;David&apos;s Son.&quot;</itunes:summary>

						<itunes:summary> Have you ever been cut off in traffic and wondered how someone can get away with such an offense?  Have you ever wished that a police officer would have witnessed the person who aggressively cut you off so you can have the satisfaction of knowing that the person got a ticket?  Imagine how Israel must have felt in her exile as she was being sold as slaves once again.  The Israelites must have wondered if the Lord really cared about them.  They must have wished that the Lord saw such offenses.  So, did the Lord see the offenses? Does the Lord even care about such offenses?

						<itunes:summary>One of the great blessings of Christianity that we downplay is the blessing of being called one of the sons of God.  This is the blessing of adoption where we are called one of God&apos;s children because of the work of the only true faithful Son of God.  Is this declaration of our adoption only a New Testament teaching or is this implied in the Old Testament?  In other words was this notion of the gentiles being the sons of Israel intended in the Old Testament or is this just something that is new?  If you are curious about these questions please stay tuned to our sermon titled, &quot;Bethel&apos;s Children.&quot;

						<itunes:summary>We saw in our series on 1 Thessalonians that Paul is encouraging the church to look forward to the day of the Lord.  However, the prophet Joel, who makes the Day of the Lord a major topic in his prophecy, does not seem to present this day as something joyful.  In our study the day of the Lord has been the army that comes against Israel and brings destruction.  Does Joel ever promise relief from this army?  Does Joel present anything good about this day?  If you are curious about these questions please stay tuned to our sermon titled, &quot;The Last Exodus.&quot;</itunes:summary>

						<title>The Christian Priest (LD 12; Psalm 110)</title>

						<itunes:subtitle>Lord&apos;s Day 12; Psalm 110 (www.fresnourc.com)</itunes:subtitle>
						<itunes:summary> We can talk about Christ being the priest associated with a line that is superior to Aaron&apos;s.  A key passage for this is Hebrews 7, but what about Psalm 110?  Psalm 110 is a passage that Hebrews cites to make the case that Christ is superior to Levi&apos;s line.  So, if this is true what is significant about Psalm 110?  What is the assurance we have that Christ being a superior priest is a source of encouragement for us? If you are curious about these questions please stay tuned to our sermon titled, &quot;The Christian Priest.&quot;
