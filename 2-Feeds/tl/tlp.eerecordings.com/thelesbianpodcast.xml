											<![CDATA[ Episode 2 is a work in process.Understanding the construction of 'gender' through an analysis of transsexualism is enormous and full of intricate details. There is no one way to look at transgender people except to take it person by person. Why do they want to do this? What does it mean for them? Being transgender is as normal as being alive. Transgender people are everywhere. They are teachers, doctors, construction workers, and waiters. They attend college, have children, and enjoy careers. We at TLP honor of all those who have come to the realization that life would be better lived as the in the body that they feel on the inside. We hope you like the interview. When Mags says, &quot;Your relationship is not a checklist of body parts.&quot; we hope it touches you as it did us. ]]>
