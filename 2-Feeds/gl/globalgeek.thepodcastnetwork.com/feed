			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear TPN listeners, viewers and friends,</p>
<p>You know that we spend a LOT of time producing our shows for you.</p>
<p>And as we aren&#8217;t making money out of advertising, we&#8217;d like to ask for your support to help us keep TPN running. We have real costs in IT support, hardware, bandwidth, etc., as well as our time and effort. For the last four years, we&#8217;ve covered these costs ourselves. Outside a small amount of advertising that we have run, the majority of TPN&#8217;s costs have been covered by our founder Cameron Reilly and the TPN hosts.</p>
<p>Now, we know that paying for online content is probably new to some of you. You are used to getting it for free.</p>
<p>However, we do ask you to think about the idea of the people funding their own media. We all know that if corporate advertising is the main source of funding for the media, it influences the kinds of media that is produced and the messages they carry. We don&#8217;t want that kind of media to be the only kind out there. We want an independent media, run by the people and for the people.</p>
<p>If you want to support our efforts to bring you intelligent and entertaining content, please consider one of our donation plans below:</p>
<p>We have five ways to support a TPN podcast:</p>
<ul>A once-off donation</ul>
<ul> $2 per month subscription</ul>
<ul> $10 per month subscription</ul>
<ol> $20 per month subscription</ol>
<ol> $50 per month subscription</ol>
<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with Paypal, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; you can use any regular credit card.</p>
<p>What you&#8217;re signing up for is to automatically send us $2 every month. It will automatically come out of your Paypal account or credit card. That&#8217;s $24 a year which is a lot less than you pay for 60 minutes of music on a CD or a monthly Netflix subscription.</p>
<p>When you are entering your information, please enter the name of the podcast you are supporting and please feel free to support every TPN podcast you listen to on a regular basis by donating multiple times.</p>
<p>This subscription system is totally voluntary. If you don&#8217;t want to pay or cannot afford to pay, don&#8217;t worry &#8211; you will still get access to our podcasts for free for as long as we can keep affording to produce them for you.</p>

You know that we spend a LOT of time producing our shows for you.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I could embed this video I would. Recently the guys at <a title="Gizmodo" href="http://gizmodo.com" target="_blank">Gizmodo</a> took a tour of the LEGO factory. As you know we love LEGO so I was sucked in.</p>
<p>One of the things they were shown was the vault full of every LEGO set from the 1950&#8242;s to now. Wow! Some of this stuff is amazing. The <a title="Lego Secret Vault Contains All Sets In History" href="http://gizmodo.com/5018990/lego-secret-vault-contains-all-sets-in-history" target="_blank">video is viewable on site</a> and well worth a look.</p>
<p>See how many sets you recognize and remember. I saw a few that my brother had and I remember being launched across the bedroom <img src='http://globalgeek.thepodcastnetwork.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif' alt=':P' class='wp-smiley' />  But they are a real treasure and brought back lots of those memories.</p>
<p>The other thing is check out <a title="Lego Trip" href="http://gizmodo.com/tag/legotrip" target="_blank">all the videos and stories</a> from Gizmodo&#8217;s LEGO trip, very cool. Great write up as well.</p>
<p>Share your happy memories in the comments!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Given my profession as a theatre nurse this really got my interest. The da Vinci Surgical System is a set of computers and instrumentation. A technological advancement on the traditional Laparoscopic or &#8220;key-hole&#8221; surgery in that rather than the instruments being held by the surgeon they are held by a robot. The surgeon controls the movement of the instruments via a console. You can see <a href="http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/products/davinci_surgicalsystem/index.aspx" target="_blank">the system and specs at their website</a>.</p>
<p>Laparoscopic surgery takes a lot of skill. Not having the sense of touch and working from what you see on a monitor is totally different from &#8220;open&#8221; surgery through an incision in the skin. In fact some surgeons don&#8217;t do any laparoscopic surgery at all because it involves a whole new skill set which they have not developed.</p>
<p>So I was impressed at this video as a demonstration of skill with the da Vinci robot in the making of an origami crane. It may not look impressive at first until you see the size of the result. But I would argue that it is probably easier with the robot than free hand without the robot. The robot means that every move is smooth and steady, by hand there is far less precision. But still this is awesome and I could really appreciate the difficulty and skill involved.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" style="float: left;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2140/2564476654_e8d0a76d24_o.png" alt="WWDC_logo" width="175" height="49" />Those Apple fans and lurkers out there that could not make it to the <a title="Apple Worldwide Developers Conference" href="http://developer.apple.com/wwdc/" target="_blank">World Wide Developers Conference</a>; I thought you might be interested to know where you can get some live updates and information.</p>
<p>No doubt the conference will take <a title="twitter" href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">twitter</a> out of action. But it is OK apparently the folks at twitter have been gearing up for the rush. Another strategy that they are falling back on is the progressive &#8220;oh-shit&#8221; measures. That is as demand grows they start switching off features. <a title=" Twitter+Apple!" href="http://blog.twitter.com/2008/06/twitterapple.html" target="_blank">This from the twitter blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have isolated and created on/off switches for many Twitter features.</p></blockquote>
<p>They are also claiming that they have made some server tweaks that should make things a little more robust. Sorry but I am not holding my breath. I am not going to even say what I think about the idea that you can support a service by killing off features.</p>
<p>That said one of the best summaries that I have seen of where to get your Apple fix can be <a title="Watch, Listen &amp; Read Live Coverage of WWDC08" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/watch_listen_and_read_live_cov.php" target="_blank">found at Read Write Web</a>. They did a good job of letting people know where to go. There are a range of goto places including FriendFeed rooms, twitter, blogs and sites. So you can pick and choose or really test twitter and have them all open plus use the <a title="ReloadEvery" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/115" target="_blank">ReloadEvery extension for Firefox</a>. That extension will automatically refresh a page at an interval that you specify.</p>
<p>I was a bit disappointed not to see more utilization of live blogging services such as <a title="CoveritLive" href="http://www.coveritlive.com/" target="_blank">CoverItLive</a>. There have been a bunch of these services released in the last few months, shame they are not being used more. Maybe they are, if you find one then throw it in the comments. I would guess that if you had a poke around you&#8217;ll be able to get something on services like <a title="uStream" href="http://www.ustream.tv/" target="_blank">uStream</a>, <a title="qik" href="http://qik.com/" target="_blank">Qik</a> and <a title="seesmic" href="http://www.seesmic.com/" target="_blank">seesmic</a>.</p>
<p>Personally I am going to let the bloggers and commentators sort the wheat from the chaff and review the feeds tomorrow. My life is noisy enough already and this will also make the juicy bits float to the top. No doubt the Lab Rat will have something on it in the next show as well. But then if it is all hype and no content we will give it a miss entirely. Anyway as you guys know I am a feed junky anyway.</p>
<p>Have fun people and remember no eye gouging, name calling optional and feel free to pay out on Knightwise&#8230; he is Belgian after all and the fact that <a href="http://globalgeek.thepodcastnetwork.com/2008/06/06/the-global-geek-podcast-86-cat-puke/#comment-109453" target="_blank">I ruffled his feathers on the last show</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I generally don&#8217;t give up totally on a problem and the issue with FeedDemon not updating as our feed does was one that had me beat. But as I said; not one to accept that I was still exploring the issue and decided to contact Nick Bradbury who got the feed working and told me what to do if it happens again. This involves a new featured added to <a title="NewsGator" href="http://www.newsgator.com/" target="_blank">NewsGator online</a>.</p>
<p>Our feed is valid and working on all other services that we know of. The feed was working fine before the TPN servers started playing up. Enter non responsive servers last month. This coupled by the fact that the servers went down totally and NewsGator was getting no response from our servers.</p>
<p>Turns out that if a feed is not updated or has a fatal error and does not respond multiple times then NewsGator temporarily blacklists the server and or feed. I can understand that, it saves resources. But on the other hand it stays this way until a manual ping is done. Better would be that NewsGator set up some kind of scheduled periodical ping to see if the server is active again and if so reestablish regular indexing of the feed.</p>
<p>So the process for &#8220;forcing&#8221; NewsGator to recheck a previously &#8220;blacklisted&#8221; feed. Especially useful if you have feeds that don&#8217;t appear to be updating as they should (Matt):</p>
<ol>
<li>Log into NewsGator Online you have an account automatically if you use <a title="FeedDemon" href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx" target="_blank">FeedDemon</a></li>
<li>Go to settings on the top right</li>
<li>Select the &#8220;My Feeds&#8221; tab</li>
<li>Find the feed that is the problem</li>
<li>Manually ping the feed to force NewsGator servers to check the feed</li>
</ol>
<p>The ping button is a little obscure in that it looks like a &#8220;refresh&#8221; symbol, it is on the far right. But it is the manual ping button. Hit that and if the feed is valid and updating it should fix the problem. It only took about 30 minutes and I was receiving the latest posts from the GGP blog, <a title="The Global Geek Podcast #86 :: Cat Puke" href="http://globalgeek.thepodcastnetwork.com/2008/06/06/the-global-geek-podcast-86-cat-puke/" target="_blank"><strong>including the latest podcast</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Just note though that this only works with feeds that are valid and working. There is no point pinging a server for a feed that is borked. I think that is obvious but worth mentioning.</p>
<p>I am very pleased that our recommended feedreader is now updating our own site. Please let me know if you are using FeedDemon and it is working again for you as well.</p>
<p>Recommended reading is <a title="NewsGator feed retrieval intervals" href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2008/02/14/newsgator-feed-retrieval-intervals/" target="_blank">an article about what NewsGator does</a> by the CTO of NewsGator Greg Reinacker. The article is well worth the read. For publishers check out <a title="NewsGatorâ€™s ping endpoint" href="http://www.rassoc.com/gregr/weblog/2006/02/14/newsgators-ping-endpoint/" target="_blank">NewsGators ping endpoint details</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a title="Nick Bradbury" href="http://nick.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Nick Bradbury</a> for his assistance in sorting this problem and letting us know about the new ping functionality. Nice work on FeedDemon Nick, it is still our recommended feedreader and one tool I could not live without. Thanks.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, so the longer I am writing this the less time I get to work on the show. My time line this week has been awful, the worst. I noticed that John asked where the show was being Wednesday. Your right, it is usually out by now. But I have just not had a chance to get the bugger done. It is recorded and I am about 1/2 way though editing it. I thought you might appreciate the situation if I let you in on my week:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday: recorded the show and finished about 1am</li>
<li>Monday: Worked the late shift; 1430hrs till 2300hrs, in the morning I finished a job application and helped the wife clean the house.</li>
<li>Home Monday night and did an hour of editing, but had to sleep as I was a 0730 in the morning.</li>
<li>Tuesday; Late shift again; 1230hrs until 2100hrs. Edited in the morning for about 1/2 hour but had to go an d fix the driveway on our property as it is gravel and we had over 100mm of rain over night and some of the driveway was on the road.</li>
<li>Got home Tuesday night and had dinner. Had some domestic paperwork to do for the extension. Edited the show for an hour after that but fell asleep at the keyboard&#8230; Thought I needed to go to bed.</li>
<li>Wednesday (today) , 10 hour shift &#8211; 0700hrs till 1800hrs. I actually worked until 2100hrs due to an emergency at work.</li>
<li>Got home, had dinner and then I had to return a phone call.</li>
<li>Tomorrow I have another 10 hour shift&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>I had every intention of getting the show out tonight. But as you guys know I work in the medical profession and sometimes you just can not walk out of the place.</p>
<p>My kids have not seen me for 4 days. I am absolutely buggered beyond reason. But I am going to work on the show tonight. I need to get the show out and I am trying.</p>
<p>But thought to share that with your guys so that you knew what the go was and that I am doing my best.</p>
<p>Stay tuned it is coming!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You want it you got it. It doesn&#8217;t matter what I seem to do the show refuses to shrink. You guys have said time and time again that you would rather it big so this week it is well big. I am not going to add to it by making this any more than usual.</p>
<p>But I will say that we had a great time recording the show this week and there was as usual some very funny moments. In addition I am very pleased with the edit and mix, creatively I am pretty happy with it. I hope that it is all that you want it to be.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I came across an article today speaking about a guy in Sweeden who put together a <a href="http://helmer.sfe.se/" target="_blank">linux-based 3D rendering farm</a> that he could run in his own house.Â  The remarkable part: he built a six-node cluster and used an Ikea <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/40107872" target="_blank">Helmer</a> drawer unit as the case&#8230; for all six nodes.</p>
<p><img style="margin: 4px; vertical-align: baseline;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3177/2520413140_87b624cbe3_d.jpg" alt="Helmer Render Farm" width="500" height="375" /><br />
Image courtesy <a href="http://helmer.sfe.se/" target="_blank">helmer.sfe.se</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an amazing piece of engineering, yet so simple in concept.Â  Janne has provided a <a href="http://helmore.sfe.se/" target="_blank">bunch of other pictures</a> on his website.Â  They&#8217;re worth a look.Â  A perfect example of function over form, and simply doing what&#8217;s necessary to &#8220;make it work&#8221;.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This video comes from <a href="http://www.startupschool.org/" target="_blank">Startup School 2008</a>. Mike talks about marketing your startup. Now just throw out what you &#8220;think&#8221; of Mike for the moment, you can pick your opinions up after you watch the video.</p>
<p>While the video focuses on startup marketing and getting noticed, I think that there are some really good ideas and information for everyone. There is also talk about users, community and social networks. There is also a 10 minute question time at the end. One of the questions is &#8220;How do you recover from bad press?&#8221;. Quite funny, but some really great strategies for doing so none the less. Also including some details and interesting insights from Arrington about what social media to use in order to market yourself. This stuff applies to the aspiring blogger not just the multi-million dollar start-up and A-list blogger.</p>
<p>One thing that really struck home for me is the value that media producers and bloggers need to have in their community. That is your audience and for us that means you guys. I can honestly say that one thing I value more than anything here in our community is the Eric&#8217;s, Herne&#8217;s, Knightwise&#8217;s, Ape&#8217;s, George&#8217;s, Doug&#8217;s, Brie&#8217;s, BlogSlut&#8217;s and all the rest that I have failed to mention. Thank you for all your support and being active contributors &#8211; without you the comments would be boring and we would feel like we were talking to ourselves.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here it is as promised, Part B of the Global Geek Podcast Number 84. Trust that this has worked out OK for everyone.</p>
<p>Chunk B features the GGP Mac Lab Rat, Sites and services, the updates and all the feedback we could muster.</p>
<p>As usual the second half of the show is a lot of fun. We lost Cait for a while but managed to find her, Keith got a bit tongue tied and Dave stepped out.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback so far on Chunk A, let us know what you think about Chunk B.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am going to take a guess and say that <a title="LoÃ¯c Le Meur blog" href="http://loiclemeur.com/" target="_blank">Loic</a> has had an great idea to demonstrate the effectiveness of new media and video for conversation and buzz generation using <a title="seesmic" href="http://www.seesmic.com/" target="_blank">seesmic</a>. Great idea, wait till you see it in action.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong>: The up and coming new Indiana Jones Movie &#8220;<a title="Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" href="http://www.indianajones.com/site/index.html" target="_blank">Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull</a>&#8220;. The movie is due for release here in Australia on the 22nd of May (<a title="Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/" target="_blank">IMDB</a>). But just how he snagged Harrison Ford to interview for seesmic I don&#8217;t know! There is nothing on seesmic accept the videos, nothing on Loic&#8217;s Blog so I guees we will find out in due course.</p>
<p>So <a title="harrison" href="http://seesmic.com/harrison" target="_blank">Harrison Ford has his own username on seesmic</a> and there are a couple of videos up there of an interview with him. Looks like the interview has been broken up into questions with each one making a new video post. Harrison seems relaxed and quite candid, which you might expect &#8211; he is a bit of a veteran at this stuff.</p>
<p>So far there is one video on his Fave Indiana Movie:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="353" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://seesmic.com/Standalone.swf?video=EPDxSHsXBc" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="353" src="http://seesmic.com/Standalone.swf?video=EPDxSHsXBc" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>Plus one on the stunts, which I think is a great response:</p>
<p><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="353" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://seesmic.com/Standalone.swf?video=hGQYDrSKAa" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="353" src="http://seesmic.com/Standalone.swf?video=hGQYDrSKAa" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>I am guessing that these are going to be filtered out over the next week in the lead up to release. What a fantastic idea. I love the fact that Harrison has appeared for seesmic and it &#8220;feels&#8221; a lot more personal and laid back. As opposed to some stuffy mainstream media interview. Bloody fantastic, I think Loic really does understand this space and the users that are a part of it.</p>
<p>But <a title="Re: Questions for Harrison Ford" href="http://seesmic.com/v/vYchJxYaL7" target="_blank">as jjprojects states</a>; to really pull this one off it would br great if <strong>we</strong> could ask the questions! So how about it Loic? Seesmic is about the conversation right? So how about letting the users in on that conversation. How cool would it be to have Harrison Ford responding to users of seesmic? Damn, now that would be cool.</p>
<p>Who would you like to ask questions of on seesmic?</p>
<p><strong>Update: </strong>Maybe <a title="Cate" href="http://seesmic.com/cate" target="_blank">Cate Blanchett</a>? That means this is the run of the mill mass interview by the media of stars. Still I don&#8217;t retract my statement that I think it is a great idea, but lets take it to the next level.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" style="float: right;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3259/2496149419_d7f2b890e5_o.gif" alt="Box_Shot FeedDemon" width="89" height="85" />As everyone would know we are fans of FeedDemon, an excellent feedreader. If you did not know, now you do. FeedDemon also supports podcasts and inline video and many, many more features. Plus best of all it is <strong>free</strong>!</p>
<p>Got a surprise when I saw in my feeds that FeedDemon just updated, which I am downloading now. It has not filtered down to auto updates within FeedDemon as yet and when I tried the &#8220;Check for new Version&#8221; nothing happened. So we must be in early. There is nothing up on <a title="Nick Bradbury" href="http://nick.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Nick Bradbury&#8217;s blog either</a>. Mind you <a title="Nick in Denver" href="http://twitter.com/nbradbury/statuses/809393470" target="_blank">he has been in Denver</a>. So I am figuring a minor release with bug fixes and minor changes you would be hard pressed finding.</p>
<p>Kick over to the homepage and <a title="FeedDemon" href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/Default.aspx" target="_blank">check out FeedDemon 2.7</a>. I will no doubt let you know on this weeks show what the go is.</p>
<p>Something that is worth checking out at Nicks blog is how to tweak FeedDemon to <a title="FriendFeed Search in FeedDemon" href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2008/04/friendfeed-sear.html" target="_blank">search FeedFriend</a> and <a title="Tweet Scan: Twitter Search in FeedDemon" href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2008/04/tweet-scan-twit.html" target="_blank">tweetscan</a> right in FeedDemon. Most excellent. Check out Nicks Tutorial on <a title="Extending FeedDemon: Creating &quot;Search Definitions&quot;" href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2008/04/extending-feedd.html" target="_blank">extending FeedDemon</a> detailing how to do this and where to put the code that the post links to. Great stuff Nick! Hope to hear about the new release notes on FeedDemon 2.7 soon.</p>
<p>See you all this week when we will be podcasting from inside your head.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img align="left" title="Yahoo!" alt="Yahoo!" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2060/2472763349_257d0349fc_o.png" />First thing I thought was &#8220;about bloody time!&#8221;. Yahoo! and McAfee have partnered up to provide integrated search security on the results pages, they call it &#8220;<a title="Search Scan" target="_blank" href="http://tools.search.yahoo.com/newsearch/searchscan">Search Scan</a>&#8220;. The result is prominent warnings at the top of the page and next to the offending link with a &#8220;hover&#8221; for details. However sites that have browser exploits and drive-by downloads as identified by McAfee will not even appear in the results. The remaining &#8220;bad&#8221; links are those that:</p>
<ul>
<li>have files in which there may be spyware, viruses (no difference in my mind) or potentially harmful applications</li>
<li>send unsolicited email or share your email address with 3rd parties without your consent</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><img title="Bad Link" alt="Bad Link" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2102/2472778231_396fe4a0e6_o.png" /></div>
<p><em>This image was altered to protect people from themselves</em></p>
<p>According to Yahoo this is in direct response to users stating that security and privacy are the top concern for users when online. Thoughtful of Yahoo to also include the two extremes in your preferences you can select to turn the feature completely off and have zero filtering. Secondly you can select the search results to totally remove any link with a warning. Nice one Yahoo.</p>
<p>I would add to that that if people are that concerned about their privacy and security they should do something about it. While this is a good move by Yahoo and wise, it only serves to protect the stupid and for them there is probably no hope anyway. I have been taking advantage of Site Advisor for about 2 years now. It is available as an extension for Firefox and <strong>*cough*</strong> IE. Users need to be proactive about their security and privacy and yeah it takes a bit of effort to do so; but so does locking your car. I am glad if only it adds some protection for the rest of us that do put the effort into keeping ourselves clean and private.</p>
<p>I am not about to knock these features, it is a great thing and helps to protect users from themselves. If you are a &#8220;bit&#8221; serious about your security and privacy then these are my quick tips:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t use Internet Explorer</strong>: sorry but it remains one of the primary vectors for malicious software on the web</li>
<li><strong>Install a decent anti-virus</strong>: I use <a title="Avast! for Free" target="_blank" href="http://www.avast.com/">Avast!</a> and set it to update automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Have a decent Firewall</strong>: I use <a title="ZoneAlarm" target="_blank" href="http://www.zonealarm.com/store/content/home.jsp">ZoneAlarm Pro</a>, but also highly recommend <a title="Comodo Firewall" target="_blank" href="http://www.comodo.com/">Comodo Firewall</a></li>
<li><strong><a title="SiteAdvisor" target="_blank" href="http://www.siteadvisor.com/">Install Site Advisor</a></strong>: Gives you the same features that are at Yahoo! across all the major search engines. One of my &#8220;can&#8217;t live without&#8221; extensions. It becomes automatic to check it.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t click links in IM and email</strong>: If you don&#8217;t know where it goes and you don&#8217;t know the sender then don&#8217;t click it, simple</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t open unknown email attachments</strong>: The promise of a Paris tit-fest is a lure you idiot, so wipe the surprised look off your face when your newly installed decent Anti-virus is screaming at you that it has found a nasty thing on your computer</li>
<li><strong>Click Ctrl + Alt + Del Once in a while at start-up</strong>: learn what all those weird apps are that start when your computer does, a search on Google will be helpful and there are some great search engines dedicated to the cause, like <a title="ProcessLibrary" target="_blank" href="http://www.processlibrary.com/">ProcessLibrary</a>. Then you&#8217;ll start to recognize when something might be there that should not be.</li>
<li><strong>Check the SSL Cert</strong>: When your shopping online take the time to take advantage of that &#8220;View Certificate&#8221; in Firefox and make sure that the domain matches the site and that the certificate is valid and not expired. Piece of mind is a good thing.</li>
<li><strong>Common sense</strong>: Yes plain and simple THINK! Use your head and think, think think &#8211; Whinnie the Pooh does it now you have a go. If it does not add up then it probably doesn&#8217;t! Looks dodgy? Probably is! Simple eh? So why don&#8217;t users do it?</li>
<li><strong>Keep your system and software patched</strong>: this includes all your apps/OS and your online stuff like that install of WordPress with your precious blog on it. If you are using old software versions and platforms, don&#8217;t be surprised when you wake up to check your blog stats and you see a giant ad for penis enlargements or the Russian hackers association!</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few things off the top of my head that I do daily, there are more but I thought 10 was a good number to stop at. I am constantly thinking about security you can not be any other way and be a part of the web and have a clean PC and intact privacy. Not to mention the fact that the whole penis enlargement thing woudl be hard to explain to your boss.</p>
<p>I got burned once with a zero day virus. A particularly nasty drive-by one that wrote to my boot sector. I lost everything. But I learned a great deal and swore that it would never happen again. I got serious about my security and taught myself to get with the program.</p>
<p>Oh and back-up, back-up, back-up&#8230; cause sometimes it doesn&#8217;t matter what you do something borks.</p>
<p>Let us know in the comments your tips on what you do to protect your security and privacy.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t use IE, please&#8230; Doug! talk&#8217;in to you buddy!!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes we are still here, and here is the latest on the server situation. Basically the blogs have been migrated to the new servers and they are sort of working. There is still work to do and things to tweak however.</p>
<p>The blog is working as you can see, we were even going to have a show out this week. But late last week we found a major problem. It would appear that our RSS feed is dead. That means that anything we post here is not getting to our loyal listeners. You won&#8217;t get this post unless you visit the blog.</p>
<p>This also means that the show won&#8217;t make it to iTunes or peoples RSS readers. So there is not much point producing a heap of material that few people will get to hear. We want everything to be right and working.</p>
<p>The tech team is working on the problem and that is as much as I know right now. As Cam says in <a target="_blank" title="TPNâ€™s Re-boot Completed!" href="http://tpn.thepodcastnetwork.com/2008/05/01/tpns-re-boot-completed/">the latest from the TPN blog</a>, there are going to be bugs with the new servers and it will take a bit longer to sort them out fully. Please be patient and rest assured that we have not abandoned you.</p>
<p>We would like to take the opportunity to thank all listeners that have dropped us a comment or email, tweet to say hello and where the heck are ya? Thanks, we appreciate the support and we are looking forward to be back podcasting and blogging more regularly soon.</p>
<p>If you have not already make sure you add us to your follow list on twitter I regularly tweet updates there as to what is going on.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Looks like the US military is on a different type of recruitment drive, their biggest problem is attracting the recruits they want: hackers.</p>
<p>Obviously the Internet is a minefield and the governments of this world are interested in what goes on in it, additionally computer and network security is a concern and one they have a priority in maintaining as just that: secure. The military interest in computer security is obvious. That said it appears they feel that their &#8220;regular members&#8221; of the military could be complimented by a different crowd.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Col. Jeff Kendall of the Air Force Cyber Command (AFCYBER) stated that there are distinctive challenges recruitingÂ  in the area of &#8220;cyber warfare&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Perhaps we need a different kind of warrior in this domain&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>(Not sure if that is a bad pun or not)</p></blockquote>
<p>Col. Jeff goes onto to suggest that perhaps the physical requirements the military has doesn&#8217;t quite fit for the type of recruits that they want. Read: people that spend all day in front of a computers(s) on a staple diet of coke and pizza, bad sleeping habits and have forgotten what sunshine looks like.</p>
<p>Other considerations are the fact that the personnel they want might not have maintained the law in quite the way it was intended and that the life of a hacker by nature means that they have probably haven&#8217;t. If you think this might block you from entering the military into the cyber warfare division then think again&#8230; they are probably willing to over look the fact that you more than likely operated outside the law to obtain your talents.</p>
<p>Basically I think that the military is seeing that the hacker represents someone of great skill and abilities that the military can&#8217;t replicate in it&#8217;s training. They realize that who they want probably doesn&#8217;t &#8220;fit the mold&#8221; and so they are rethinking how they can change the mold. Smart thinking in my opinion.</p>
<p>I guess if you think you have what it takes then go and check out the Air Force Cyber Command Homepage. I would really appreciate it if you left our blog as it is, we have had enough trouble lately.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hope that our listeners&#8217; week went well, our is getting better. Just wanted to let you know that Cam, CEO of TPN has made a <a title="TPN troubles" target="_blank" href="http://tpn.thepodcastnetwork.com/2008/04/10/tpn-troubles">post on The Podcast Network Blog</a> about the latest woes and trouble that we have been experiencing with the servers and pretty much where we are at now.</p>
<p>We are not totally out of the woods right now but things are better than they were a week ago. Check out what Cam had to say and again we thank you for your patience and continuing support.</p>
<p>It ain&#8217;t easy being green, but we are learning to cope with it. Please continue to let us know of any kookyness that you might have with the network and we are doing our best to resolve issues as they occur.</p>
