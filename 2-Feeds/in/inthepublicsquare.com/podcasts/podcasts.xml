								<title>Indiana Tea Party Counter Union Rally</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Wisconsin and Indiana have become the focus of a political showdown between union backed Democrats and Republicans. In Indiana the democrats split town refusing to vote on issues such as the “Right to work”, and Mitch Daniel&apos;s school reform. Engineer Nick Ellis and Diana Jewel, both Indiana residences, share their experiences at the Indianapolis state capitol building of the Indianapolis Tea Party&apos;s counter-rally – aimed at voicing a different opinion from the unions, only to be met with typical union-thug tactics. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>The Permanent Ruling Class</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Listen in as In the Public Square Team discusses the American bureaucracy that cannot be changed. Since Civil Service Reform in the 1890?s (The Pendleton Act) the idea that government should be run by ?professionals? has resulted in the creation of a permanent class of government employees who cannot be fired or laid off. Consequently, all our elected representatives are beholden more to the interest of public service unions and bureaucrats than to the American people. Congressional Representatives, Senators, Cabinet Members and Presidents come and go by the election process but the same old government employee class continues to accrue power and empire build without any recourse in the process of democracy. Ultimately, this means that America is less and less a government of, for, and by the people, and more and more a government controlled by a permanent ruling class. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Listen in as Host John Snyder, Mr. Everyman Nick Ellis and Stephen Z. Nemo, (AKA Mr. Curmudgeon) discuss the Left's Death Wish. Despite polling data that shows opposition above 70%, why are Democrats defying public opinion and apparently willing to destroy themselves in order to pass &quot;reforms&quot; that the American people do not want? What does this tell us about the Left's worldview and the character of the Democratic Party? There is more here than mere political difference. We are dealing with true believers--the age old character of arrogance and evil in the guise of martyrs to a false religion called Utopia. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Debt, indifference and redirection of emphasis means that America soon will have no manned space program. This means the United States will be incapable of repairing orbiting satellites and space stations, which ultimately means reduced military intelligence. In short, this country will be falling behind China, Russia, Europe and possibly even Iran in mastering the &quot;High Ground&quot; of space. This is one of the many dangerous consequences of government diverting its attention from its primary duty of national defense, and concentrating on programs and enterprises that are simultaneously imprudent and unconstitutional.

Hence, all human action, like negligence, is governed by an operational assumption that moral beings have a DUTY TO KNOW. This is why innocence is so hard to find. Even when we think we know, our fallen nature often voluntarily blinds us to the consequence of poor decisions and omissions of action. This is why we are bound morally and held accountable to think deeply about serious things. ]]></itunes:summary>

Rather than remaining trapped in these politically questionable contexts, perhaps it is wiser to view the great divide in human thinking as expressions of human character and personality. Perhaps these political divisions are a false dichotomy between materialists and spiritualists.

Nevertheless, there is a darker side to the licensing of knowledge. What dangers exist in allowing the state to assert that it has authority over the dissemination and application of knowledge? Is the proper role of authority to sanction skill and knowledge or does knowledge more properly bestow authority?

								<title>Marriage Reconsidered: Thoughts on the Nature of Marriage</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Listen into this three-way discussion on the legal, theological and philosophical rationale for marriage. Host John Snyder interacts with guest attorneys Alexandra Berauer and Daniel J. DeWit for a rambunctious conversation that attempts to get to the core of what marriage really is. So much of the institution has changed over times that in many ways, even Christians, are likely to confuse the legal accretions of marriage, for marriage itself. By reexamining this God ordained institution perhaps, we can arm ourselves better for the coming culture war over the meaning and definition of marriage. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Why the Economy Failed</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Host John Snyder and ITPS Contributor Daniel J. DeWit discuss how issues of character, virtue and moral consciousness are at the center of our present financial crisis. Although we tend to perceive economics as exclusively the domain of material things like goods and services, the market actually reflects the invisible commerce of good faith and character. If we do not enter the market in good faith, economic transactions begin to break down. If we do not bring virtue and character into the bargain, the free market will fail. We have forgotten that without honesty and good faith capitalism cannot work. Free enterprise, which has served us so well, will become as predatory and dysfunctional as socialism. Tragically, America does not understand this anymore, because we have become both nihilists and materialists. We think the market is purely a place of physical exchange. Rather human bargains and promises are metaphysical things. We do not understand this--because we believe we can get something for nothing. Honest men know better. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: February 12, 2009 marked the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin and Abraham Lincoln whose views of life were diametrically opposite to one another. Listen in as Dr. Fuzale Rana of Reasons to Believe and ITPS's David Llewellyn discuss these two men and two world views they personify. Dr. Rana will discuss the science that Darwin did not understand, and David will illuminate the ideas of the great Emancipator-Abraham Lincoln. We will explore the metaphysics of evolution and materials and compare it to the ideas of Lincoln. Can we properly assert that human beings have a nature, if our natures evolve and are beholden to change over time? Lincoln asserted that humanness is fixed and absolute. Darwin, on the other hand, believed and advocated that nature and man are neither fixed nor absolute in meaning or nature over time and evolution. Only one of these views can be true. Which is it? ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Tonight Host John Snyder discusses the Puritan Revolution and the history of the idea that law and not men hold power in constitutional government. With the swearing-in of Barack Obama and the concerns of many conservatives, there is whispering rebellion against the abuse of overbearing and non-constitutional governmental power. All true, but have we reached the point of rebellion? What is the remedy for the lawlessness of the state? How should we rather reform society and culture other than by force? Listen in as Host John outlines the accomplishments of the Puritans and shows that “culture war” is nothing new—that the transformation of society, men and states, comes not by legislation, laws, decrees, presidents, tax reform, or economic power—but by the reformation of the soul. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Listen in as Host John Snyder discusses Socialism&apos;s confusion of the Church and the State. It is not conservatives and Christians who wish to unify the authority of Church and State. Rather it is the left that creates in the state a surrogate and counterfeit religion that presumes to be the origin of morality and the source of meaning. This is what Nazism was. It was what the heroic socialism of Stalin and Lenin was. Its historical antecedents are Caesarism and the priest-kings of antiquity. Socialism is an atavistic return to the tribal origins of religion, family and state all being one indistinguishable institution run by the father-priest-king. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Listen in as Host John Snyder and Co-Host Alexandra Berauer discuss the internal difficulty of governing a nation that has too expansive a view of liberty. With examples from the Walter Hoye Case in Oakland, and the Marriage Amendment in California, the ITPS team will explore the problem of whether express words in the law should trump the implied reach of unenumerated rights. And when implied rights as discovered and asserted by judges and special interest groups trump the express will of the people when it is explicitly stated in legislation, can a republic survive if it is ruled by the whim of lawless judges? Too often freedom gives rise to sloth and indifference because we are caught up in the distractions of a consumer society. We need to be informed upright custodians of our liberty, because it is only with liberty that we can fulfill our natures as creative spiritual beings. Listen in as ITPS discusses the Problem of Liberty. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Is Socialism Good For Us?</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Listen is as Host John Snyder discusses whether Socialism is really good for us? In light of what we should expect under an Obama Administration and a Democratic Party controlled Congress, Americans should begin thinking more deeply about what Socialism will mean for us, and why we should be leery of it. Republican talk radio vehemently condemns the excessive transfers of wealth under a welfare state as being unjust, intrusive of economic liberty, and an impediment to productivity. But are these the most dangerous aspects of Socialism? Tonight Night a conservative Christians will explore what Socialism is at a deeper level. Is the problem with the welfare state primarily one of inefficiency and restricted freedom or is there something deeper in the presumptions of Socialism that ultimately run contrary to human nature as we find it rather than what we wish it were. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>The Invisible</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Listen in as Host John Snyder discusses the importance of invisible things. Often we are inclined to believe that the universe is purely a place of physical existence, a place where real things exist only if they can be weighed, seen, touched, heard, tasted, or smelled. And while we feel comfortable with immaterial things like notions of love or beauty, we are trained to think these have artificial existence or are unreal or less real than physical things. This idea is the legacy of the materialist assumptions that have gained philosophical prominence in Western Thinking over the last several hundred years. Ironically the fact that IDEAS and PHILOSOPHY have profound effect on our civilization is PROOF that immaterial things are real. Indeed, ideas and invisible reality is MORE important than physical things, because it is the invisible that shapes the visible world. These immaterial things form our belief systems, our ideas about the good, the true and the beautiful. They order justice, law and civil government. They control personal actions and behavior, our motives in war and peace and history. They are the essence of meaning itself and govern the universe by the abstract rule of physical laws and numbers. In short, the invisible universe orders, moves and directs, in some mysterious way, the world of physical things: men, inventions, national efforts, armies and religions. It is the Invisible that precedes and orders the visible. Or to state in another way, our immaterial God is the author of all things seen and unseen and is the origin of Reality itself. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Why The Christ-Child Matters</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Host John Snyder will make the case that everything we think and do in life rests upon the presuppositions of our worldview. And it is our worldview that determines how we think about everything from love and sex to the great questions of goodness, truth and beauty. Hence what we hold to be of primary importance, things like God and truth determine whether men should be good or bad, whether Radical Islam is worth defeating, whether freedom is possible, whether democracy can work, whether wealth can make us happy, or whether abortion is right. Our worldview will affect our notions of liberty, tolerance, equality and justice. It will shape our beliefs about what humans are and what the purpose of being human is-if there is purpose at all. Listen in as In the Public Square discusses why the Christ Child matters, why Christianity has more explanatory power than other prevailing worldviews. Feel free to challenge us as we compare and contrast Christ and the Biblical Tradition with the worldviews of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Philosophical Naturalism.

								<title>Lessons from The Battle of Fredericksburg</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: This week Host John Snyder discusses the beam in the eye of the Republican Party and challenges some of the assumptions of knee-jerk conservatism and blabber-mouth talk radio. Later we  commemorate the anniversary of the great and terrible battle of Fredericksburg (Dec 11th 1862), where the Union Army under Major General Ambrose Burnside was tragically defeated in a effort to cross the Rappahannock River in winter and carry the battle for the republic into Virginia and contest the Confederate army of Northern Virginia on its own turf. Seldom discussed and mostly forgotten, this battle serves as an illustration of the kinds of problems a democratic nation confronts in times of unpopular war and what presidents and generals do and often fail to do in the crisis and political confusion of war.. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Why do civilizations decline?</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Why do civilizations decline?  Is wealth bad for us?  Does prosperity destroy the work ethic and nurture decadence and entitlement?  Could it be that freedom is ultimately toxic to us?  If civil and economic success breeds generations of slothful reprobates, is the decline and fall of great civilizations inevitable?  Listen in as Alexandra Berauer and John Snyder discuss the challenge of affluence and freedom and the tragic effect of plenty in the decline and degeneration of culture.  Is it possible to overcome the influences and momentum of vulgarity, ennui and self-indulgence?  Listen as the ITPS crew explore creativity and nobleness as inherent to us as men and women, and remind those of us who despair in our modern culture atrophy, that all men bear the image of God, that we are inherently spiritual beings,  creators, thinkers, and problem solvers.  It is only when we indulge the appetites and forsake character and the higher aspirations of the spirit do we become effete, little and ugly.  Even so, when we reject the noble and good, for the perverse and stupid, the barbarian comes and in his simple forthright way begins the regeneration of a civilization by asserting  simple, primary things over the complex, confused decadence and distractions of materialism and the vanity of acquisitive affluence.  Poverty therefore is not the absence of material things; rather it is the absence of spiritual rectitude.  The question is: is it possible for societies and individuals to regenerate and reform themselves?  Christians have an answer. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Left-Right Distinctions</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: What are the differences that separate the political Left from the political Right?  Many people believe  that the primary distinction is rooted in competing economic views of life and fiscal policy.  Oddly, the Left and the Right today both hold similar, if not identical, views of man as a political and economic animal.  Indeed these common assumptions that have gorwn invisible to us, have given rise to the present malaise in the shattered Republican Party.  Tragically the political Right in America has drifted into collusion with the Marxist view of men and things.  Listen in as Host John Snyder attempts to get below the surface of this question and discusses the political divide within the context of character and metaphysics. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Naturalism and the Cell's design</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: The program begins with a 15 minute discussion with Journalist Stephen Z. Nemo, (Mr. curmudgeon) on the recent decision in Great Britain to allow Sharia law Courts jurisdiction to arbitrate in cases arising among Muslims. Dr. Fazale Rana is call-in guest In the Public Square answering the hard questions about irreducible complexity and intelligent design. He is author of the recently published book The Cell&apos;s Design. He has also co-authored a number of works with author Dr. Hugh Ross, including Who was Adam? and Origins of Life. He is also a frequent panelist on Creation Update and Science News Flash. Modern apologists for Darwinian Naturalism claim that ID (Intelligent Design) is merely the fevered imaginings of desperate Christians. Is that criticism true? In the time of Darwin the cell was seen simply as a mass of protoplasm. Now we know on much closer examination that that the simple single cell is not so simple. Indeed, it is enormously complex—so complex in fact it challenges explanation how the primary building block of life could have emerged by a natural and linear evolutionary process. Nevertheless, Host John Snyder promises to be Devil&apos;s Advocate and ask the hard questions and not just toss the softballs. Good natured and fun to listen to Dr. Fuz Rana of Reasons to Believe promises to entertain and educate. Whether you agree or disagree you will come away with a firmer knowledge of what the ID community is claiming ]]></itunes:summary>

								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: On August 4th of this year, just two weeks ago, Alexander Solzhenitsyn died. Who was Alexander Solzhenitsyn? After establishing himself as one of the preeminent critics of Stalin and Soviet Communism, he was stripped of his Russian citizenship and forced to emigrate from his country in the 1970&apos;s. He chose to come to America where we wanted to hear the outraged voice of a dissident itemize the crimes of Marxist totalitarianism. Instead he told America what it did not want to hear. In 1979 he outlined his vision and fears in his famous Harvard Speech. And from that point on, for all practical purposes, he was shunned by the effete and stupefied West. Alexander Solzhenitsyn told us what we did not want to hear—like all prophets. When he died, the silence was deafening. The host himself did not even hear of his death until ten days afterward. Shame on us. Shame on me. Listen in as In the Public Square honors the life, mind and spirit of a great man: Alexander Solzhenitsyn— author, soldier, Nobel Prize winner, dissident, prisoner of the gulag, ex-patriot, sage, and voice crying in the wilderness.

								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Co-host Alexandra Berauer interviewed Ms. Dana Cody, Executive Director of the Life Legal Defense Foundation and Mr. Walter Hoye, Founder and President of Issues4Life regarding the legal maelstrom known as anti-reproductive-rights crimes statutes such as exist in numerous states in America and particularly in the State of California. Anti-reproductive-rights crimes statutes prohibit behaviors that have long been guaranteed under common First Amendment legal understanding.The right to speak, peaceably assemble and hand out literature on a public sidewalk are bulwark rights protected by the First Amendment. California's anti-reproductive-rights crimes statute criminalizes nonviolent protests at abortion clinics and the distribution of literature within paces of the entrance of a clinic, even when such conduct is peaceable and non-intimidating. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Thinking Anew About the News</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Host John Snyder discusses food prices, oil production and the mortgage crisis as all being related to America&apos;s singular love-affair with regulation and legislation by litigation. The program investigates the problem of stagnate supply as opposed to explaining these problems as issues of increased demand. Environmental laws are no small part of the food problem. Cartels and Government ownership of oil explains most of the inflated cost of oil, while the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act in particular are tying up vast amounts of farm land that otherwise would be used to increased agricultural production. These latter regulations also have the effect of increasing development costs in the housing industry. Finally host John Snyder offers some thoughts on how to remedy these recurring banking crises using historical examples   and particularly how the Federal Government and the Federal Reserve may be made more accountable in their duty to closely regulate the money supply. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>The Purpose, Duties and Limits of War</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: War is often seen as only a physical act of violence committed by nations against one another. This is not a very insightful way of looking at war. Rather, war is primarily a metaphysical event, the struggle of abstract ideas, beliefs and moral principles played out in the incarnate world of physical things. Because war, properly undertaken, always involves moral consequence, war is not just violence, but has the purpose of restoring moral order. Once we accept this notion, war imposes duties on the combatants and the victor. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>What Happened to Republicans?</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Almost all Republicans are unhappy with their party. Why is this? What does the Republican Party represent? Where did it go wrong? What are its core values? Host John Snyder discusses the differences and similarities of the parties and the ideas and values which have separated Democrats and Republicans for nearly 150 years.The thesis is this: the democratic instinct in a constitutional republic like ours is deep and pervasive. It is fitting and proper that such a sentiment should be strong and vibrant in a representative democracy. But where do the hedges derive that shape and curtail the natural instinct of democratic man to confuse his own will with what is morally correct?The political history of the United States shows that this nation has often confused what we politically desire and what is morally right. We confuse the will of the people with the mind of the moral law. According to host John Snyder, the Republican Party, the second party, when it is true to its history and ethos, acts as a conscientious countervailing force to the natural appetite of democracies to simply do whatever they please. In short, the Republican Party, like all its preceding manifestations: the Whig Party, the Liberty Party, and the Federalists, is the shadow of moral conscience that must warn us that the sovereignty that resides in the will of the people, when it is properly understood, must rule within the constraints of prudential restraint and the moral law. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Losing the Culture War</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Just days after the California Supreme Court Decision, hosts John Snyder and Alexandra Berauer discuss the legal basis for the ruling which sanctions marriage between homosexual couples. Guest David Llewellyn, Director of the Center for Constitutional Jurisprudence brings to the discussion the history of Prop 71 and the legal background of how the case wound its way to the highest court in the State. Topics discussed include the nature of marriage, the power of courts to define reality, the importance of understanding that the foundations of this decision were laid down over forty years ago, and that the California Supreme Court is only carrying forward a line of defective legal reasoning that has largely remained unchallenged by social conservatives.Host John Snyder challenges our society to reclaim the family and the Church because the encroachment of the state into these other two foundational institutions is less the result of government growth, (although this is certain part of the reason) as much as it is a reflection of the weakness of our once intrinsic understanding of family and church. The triumph of homosexual marriage should be seen less as a triumph for gay rights as much as the legal acknowledgement that our culture already largely believes that marriage is little more than the exchange of love vows. It follows, if love is the dominant and defining feature of marriage, then the court using contemporary cultural standards is correct to so rule. Hence, without arguments about the differences between men and women, their contributions to one another, the offices of husband and wife, the sacredness of union, the family as the crux of financial responsibility and the importance of children to a healthy society, all the reasons that families have existed through time, there remains little reason to imagine the court would rule otherwise.In short, it is the failure of American culture to understand the deeper significance and dynamics of marriage which has brought about this legal turn of events. More than for any other reason, our failure to understand what a marriage is, has given rise to the political left's successful assault on the family and the accpetance by so many that the state possesses the legal power and moral prerogative to define marriage. ]]></itunes:summary>

								<title>Why the Public Square is Important</title>
								<itunes:subtitle>In the Public Square</itunes:subtitle>
								<itunes:summary><![CDATA[ In the Public Square: Hosts John Snyder and Alexandra Berauer discuss the importance of the Public Square in a self-governing community.To the degree to which dialog and discussion are essential to the political and cultural health of a community, the avenues of political, religious, cultural, and economic discussion must be open and dynamic.The Public Square is the life's blood of a self-governing community. It is the lungs through which a republic breathes. It must be a place where all people may express their thoughts and opinions without fear of reprisal or marginalization. It follows that if self-governing people must ascertain facts, discuss laws, formulate policies, develop and entertain ideas and construct the informed communities of state, family and church that are necessary for a health community, everyone must be free to speak their mind honestly in a safe and non-hostile place. In such a forum differences must be expressed without ad hominems , invectives and mean-spiritedness.These are not just nice sentiments-they are central to the success of a civilization and particularly, to a self-governing republic. Hence we call these attributes &quot;civility&quot; because they reflect the qualities of self-governing members of a thriving civilization. Civility is a moral principle. It is the necessary cultural antecedent of democracy and the rule of law. The ability to disagree without being disagreeable is fundamental to the success of a democratic-republic. It is also essential for the preservation of familiar, religious and political liberty.The challenge of the Public Square is that somehow we must be self-regulating. When people use the Public Square to insult and degrade others, even if they have the legal protections to do so, they foolishly threaten to destroy the very invisible order of civility that makes the Public Square and political freedom possible. ]]></itunes:summary>
