FORGET YOUR FAILURES AND MOVE ON TOWARD YOUR DREAMSBy James M. Becher</title><description>FORGET IT!    FORGET YOUR FAILURES AND MOVE ON TOWARD YOUR DREAMS.&lt;br /&gt;
It is a fact of life that all of us will inevitably fail&lt;br /&gt;
in something in someway at sometime along the bumpy road &lt;br /&gt;
of life.  As illustrated by our first poem (above), when this happens, we need to be able to forget it and move on toward our dreams and goals.   If you've sinned, ask for and accept God's forgiveness and then forgive yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
   To quote Steve Goodier, Publisher@LifeSupportSystem.com, "Unfortunately, no delete key can correct the past so that memories no longer hurt, frighten or humiliate. The past is what it is -- past.  And that, too, is good to remember.  It is past. Over. Finished. There is no taking it back, yet no purpose is served in re-living and rehashing old memories. It is gone. Let it be a teacher. Let us learn from its harsh les¬sons as well as its joys. Then let us leave it where it be¬longs -- in the past."&lt;br /&gt;
Robert H. Schuler tells of a shocking experience he had when a car dealer friend insisted he drive a demonstration model, and when he put the car in reverse, suddenly the digital odometer started registering the MPH in reverse.&lt;br /&gt;
As he says, "In times of defeat, it's easy to think of going backwards.  If we're going backwards, let's not count it!  The secret of success is to look ahead."&lt;br /&gt;
To quote Norman Vincent Peale:&lt;br /&gt;
"One of the most important of all skills is that of forgetting. It is said a man is what he...eats.  A man is what he forgets. ...to be happy and successful you must cultivate the ability to say to yourself--forget it!  Memory is one of our greatest facilities, [and] It is a great skill to be able to be selective and say, 'I will hold this...this other, I will cast from me."&lt;br /&gt;
   Why is this so important?  Because, and I speak from&lt;br /&gt;
experience, if you don't, the memories and regrets will eat at your mind like a cancer and will paralyze your progress to the extent that you will never be able to move ahead.  &lt;br /&gt;
   And, after all, the failure you are remembering with so much regret may not be as big of a setback as you think.  &lt;br /&gt;
To quote the mother superior in "The Sound of Music," when the Lord closes a door, He opens a window."  But we will never see the window if we are focused upon the closed door.&lt;br /&gt;
    But, what can we do, if, having tried to forget it, the&lt;br /&gt;
thoughts persist in our mind?  To further quote from Dr. Peale:&lt;br /&gt;
"There are only 2 things to do: &lt;br /&gt;
(1)do everything you reasonably can about it, &lt;br /&gt;
(2) then practice forgetting it.  Walk away from it&lt;br /&gt;
in your thoughts.  Conceive of it as lying back there growing ever more dim against the horizon as each day carries you further from it."&lt;br /&gt;
    But, not only must we walk away from the old, but walk toward the new.  Start filling your mind with new ideas and prospects for success.  If you find your mind blank, try praying.  Ask God to fill your mind with fresh new ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
Then trust that He will.  (See Phil.3:13, our verse for the week listed in the Quotes section below).&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/35977999-6222446368065068680?l=inspirationalsuccesstips.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Becher</title><description>Let’s suppose for a moment that we all believe in God.   If we believe that He made us, then He best understands how we function. And is it not reasonable that he would have left us some sort of instructions for this thing called life?  Well, He did. It's called the Bible.  When you buy a VCR, say or a stereo, it usually comes with a manual. But how often do we, in our haste to enjoy the product, try to set it up and run it without checking the manual? We think it seems so simple. Just plug this here and push that button. And then we wonder why it doesn’t work. Well, it's time to check the manual. It’s the same with life. If your life is messed up, perhaps its time to check the manual.&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;FORMULA FOR &lt;a type="amzn" search="Dynamic Living" category="books"&gt; DYNAMIC LIVING &lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/strong&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;DL=(GGE+GPS)xPSI&lt;br /&gt;dynamic living = &lt;br /&gt;God Given Equipment [potential]&lt;br /&gt;+God's Principles of Success&lt;br /&gt;X Proper Self Image.&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;FOR MORE ON GOD'S SUCCESS PRINCIPLES AND WHY I PUBLISH THIS EZINE, CLICK ON THE TITLE OF THIS ARTICLE.&lt;br /&gt;AND CHECK OUT MY LENSE ON FAITH FOR DAILY LIVING.&lt;a href="http://www.squidoo.com/FAITH-1"&gt;CLICK HERE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND For more inspiring motivation articles, &lt;a href="http://inspiringmotivationarticles.blogspot.com"&gt;go HERE&lt;/a&gt;, or better yet, subscribe FREE to the bi-weekly ezine (PAGE DOWN for instructions)&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/35977999-21652100220658855?l=inspirationalsuccesstips.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

(procedures may differ depending on your service provider)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)SEND a blank e-mail to: &lt;a href="mailto:inspirationalsuccesstips@Freeautobot.com"&gt;inspirationalsuccesstips@Freeautobot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3)Wait for the validation email (from the first address, with subject like "Please validate you subscripton to Inspirational Success Tips"), open it and CLICK ONCE on the long validation link (starting with &lt;a href="http://www.freeautobot.com/"&gt;http://www.freeautobot.com/&lt;/a&gt;...) toward the middle of the email.    You'll see a page that says you have successfully subscribed. You'll receive a more detailed welcome note right away and the first issue in a day. Normal delivery is every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT IF THE VALIDATION EMAIL DOESN'T ARRIVE? (SPAM FILTERS) (adapted)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't forget to add inspirasucestips@bellsouth.net to your email white-list (address book or list of approved senders, etc.). This should actually be done first before you send the subsribe email to &lt;a href="mailto:inspirationalsuccesstips@Freeautobot.com"&gt;inspirationalsuccesstips@Freeautobot.com&lt;/a&gt;.    ALSO: check your junk, bulk or spam folder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don't receive the verification email, and don't have a whitelist, spam, junk, or bulk folder, then your email provider has probably deleted the verification email.&lt;br /&gt;This is especially likely if you use AOL, Comcast or Excite. I've found these email providers to be especially poor in they way they handle spam-filtering.&lt;br /&gt;You will need to get an email address from a reliable provider, if you want to subscribe to Inspirational Success Tips. I find that Yahoo mail works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you've got your Yahoo Mail account, join again using your new Yahoo email address.

Becher&lt;br /&gt;I was made to realize recently the importance of purpose in the Divine scheme of things. Without purpose, we are like the proverbial man who "jumped on his horse and rode off in all directions at once." As Rick Warren reminds us, in his book, "The Purpose Driven Life," it all starts with God." So easily we forget this simple fact. One thing he says is that "the purpose of your life fits into a much larger cosmic purpose that God has designed for eternity. "&lt;br /&gt;God had a purpose when he created the universe and He had a purpose when He created us.(Rom.9:11)&lt;br /&gt;Thus, our lives have a purpose. Thus, instead of being driven by guilt, anger, fear, resentment, materialism or need for approval, we should be driven by our purpose, that is, God's purposes for us. This will give our life meaning. It will also simply and focus our life. Without a clear purpose, you will tend to make decisions based on pressures, circumstances or you present mood. Without a purpose, you may try to do too much and thus become fatigued. Without a clear purpose, we are constantly changing our direction. A knowledge of our purpose is what should motivate us and thus, energize us. And knowing our purpose prepares us for eternity, because we were made to last forever. In Ecclesiastes, Solomon says the God has put eternity in our hearts (Eccl.3:11). Pardon the preaching for a moment, but I can't get away from it--when you stand before God, He will ask you two questions: 1)What did you do with my Son, who died to save you? and 2) What did you do with what I gave you? One crucial thing which we must realize is that we were created to be loved by God. Think about that for minute--the creator of the universe made you in order to love you. Of course, we rejected His love which is why he had to send His Son to die for us in order to bring you back to Himself. We will all have to live somewhere forever. If you accept by faith the gift of His son, it will be in heaven with Him. It's simple, but if you need further instruction, please write me at inspirasucestipe@bellsouth.net with "Salvation" in the subject.&lt;br /&gt;But, let's get back to earth. Whether you are prepared for eternity or not, to get anywhere in this life, you need to realize what your purpose is. It is almost impossible to have a vision without purpose. And without a purpose, any goals which we might set would be meaningless. So let us ask ourselves, what is our ultimate purpose in life. The Westminster confession summed it up this way: "What is the chief end of man? The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever." In fact, as C.S. Lewis said, "In commanding us to glorify Him, God is inviting us to enjoy Him." Have you ever thought about that--to enjoy God? If you are in sin, you are enjoying the pleasures of sin, but, as the Bible tells us in Heb.11:25 , the are "for a season." On the other hand, the Psalmist says of God, "At your right hand are pleasures forevermore." (Ps.16:11b ) It also says "The heavens declare the glory of God and …" All creation gives glory to God and we can enjoy the fruits of God's creation, and in so doing bring Him glory. Everything that God created brings glory to him except for two classes of beings, the fallen angels (demons) and us (man.) We have all failed to give Him the glory He deserves. That's why Paul adds the second phrase in Rom.3:23. After stating the universally known fact that "all have sinned," he adds "and come short of the glory of God." If it were Hebrew poetry, this would be considered a parallelism, that is, two phrases referring to the same thing. Thus, sinning fails to glorify God and failing to glorify God, ultimately is sin. Thus Paul also tells us "Whatever you do, whether ye….do all to the glory of God. How can we do that? Just by being aware of what we are doing and asking ourselves "would this glorify God." Try it for a week and see if it doesn't change some of your habits, what you watch and listen to, etc.&lt;br /&gt;But you may ask, "How do I know if a particular thing is glorifying to God or not?" Since all true beauty and creativity originated with God, the apostle gives us another test in Philippians 4:8: "..whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about these things." If a certain activity truly meets all these requirements, I believe we can say it is glorifying to God.&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is this: When anything in creation fulfills its purpose, it brings glory to God. So it's sort-of a circle. Our chief purpose is to glorify God and when we fulfill our purpose, we do glorify God. But how do we find our specific purpose, or purposes in life? By getting to know God. We do this first through accepting the gift of His son, as mentioned earlier, and second through reading His word, applying it to our lives, and through prayer and worship. Then, through prayer we can also discover the gifts He has given to each of us and how He wants us to use them for His glory. Part of that may include reaching out and telling others about Him. We also glorify God, as I said, by running our leisure activities through the sieve of Philippians 4:8. All of the above bring glory to God, and thus helps to fulfill our ultimate purpose.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/35977999-116119108578322897?l=inspirationalsuccesstips.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
