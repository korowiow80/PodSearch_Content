      <title>The Axiom of Keys Please: Feb 3 and 5</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
  Ten years ago, I was trying to figure out what the heck to do with myself. I wanted to stay serious about music and not give up my piano training,
  but the world of professional piano performance was clearly not my cup of tea. I wanted a world my music could live in, and wasn&#8217;t sure where to find it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Then these two delightfully crazy musicians named Carei Thomas and Todd Harper asked me to do a concert with them. &#8220;What the heck!&#8221; I thought, &#8220;I&#8217;ll try anything once.&#8221;
  That concert &#8212; &lt;i&gt;Keys Please&lt;/i&gt; &#8212; was what kicked me off on the path of being a self-produced, independent musician. They taught me how to make my
  own rules on stage, how to improvise without apology, how to carve out a niche for myself. I&#8217;m tremendously grateful to them. They gave me a map.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Ten years and ten concerts years later, Keys Please is an annual tradition. This year&#8217;s special guest is the versicolored bassist Brian Roessler. There will be Brahms,
  Messiaen, improvs ranging from subtle to wild, and &#8230; oops! I&#8217;m giving away too much already.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Here&#8217;s &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/keysplease/"&gt;all the info on the concert&lt;/a&gt; (including some videos of past performances).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  Bonus concert: I'm also playing on the &lt;a href="http://www.composersforum.org/program/tuesday-salons-studio-z-saint-paul-mn"&gt;ACF Tuesday Salon&lt;/a&gt; tonight.

      <title>Upcoming concert at Merkin Hall in NYC</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.matthewmccright.org/"&gt;Matthew McCright&lt;/a&gt; will be premiering my &lt;i&gt;Disembodied Dance&lt;/i&gt; this Saturday at &lt;a href="http://kaufman-center.org/merkin-concert-hall"&gt;Merkin Hall&lt;/a&gt; in New York City. A rough draft of the piece appeared on this blog; this weekend, you can hear the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew is an excellent pianist, and it&#8217;s really exciting to hear him play my work. He&#8217;s got chops that I don&#8217;t, and thus has interpretive options in a virtuosic climax that aren&#8217;t available to me. But what really sets Matthew apart is that he&#8217;s truly &lt;i&gt;musical&lt;/i&gt;, and in those most important places where the music stands or falls on a single note, or a single moment of lingering, he will have you holding your breath. That is rare, especially among those who focus on new music as he does. I&#8217;m a lucky composer to have a performer of his artistry play my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the concert are also five of my fellow Minnesota composers. I had a chance to hear the whole the whole program last weekend, and was really impressed at the compositions. It&#8217;s all new work &#8212; not 20th century, but &lt;i&gt;new!&lt;/i&gt; It&#8217;s full of power and poetry and darkness and sweetness, whole worlds. This concert is a hug and a gut punch. What will the New Yorkers make of it, I wonder? And will they think that Minnesota is on the West Coast? (Some of them, probably yes, but then I had people in my home state of Colorado think I was going to college &#8220;out East&#8221; in Minnesota.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your options: (1) Be there. (2) Be square. (3) Be living somewhere other than NYC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew McCright: Piano Innovation&lt;br&gt;Merkin Hall, New York City&lt;br&gt;Saturday, September 25 &#8212;&#160;8:00 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="http://kaufman-center.org/merkin-concert-hall/event/american-composers-forum-piano-innovation"&gt;More info / Buy Tickets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, by the way, I am still hot at it with the music. This blog has been quiet for a long time, but I have some big recording projects in progress. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chopin Preludes 4 and 9 (remastered)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visiting the house of my composer friend &lt;a href="http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/08/01_combsm_pix/"&gt;Matthew Smith&lt;/a&gt; (who has an &lt;a href="http://www.innova.mu/artist1.asp?skuID=226"&gt;outstanding CD&lt;/a&gt; out now, by the way), I noticed the score to Chopin&#8217;s E minor prelude out on the piano. It turns out that his wife, children&#8217;s book illustrator and author &lt;a href="http://www.laurenstringer.com/"&gt;Lauren Stringer&lt;/a&gt;, is taking piano lessons, and she has been working on it. I was delighted &#8212; the piece is a favorite of mine. I dug out my recording of it for her to hear, and decided it was high time that I release a remastered version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The piece has been a popular one on &lt;i&gt;In the Hands&lt;/i&gt; &#8212; people have left &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2005/02/22/79/"&gt;many comments&lt;/a&gt; on it &#8212; and I think that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s so popular with beginning piano students like Lauren. All of us who are, or once were, beginners owe Chopin our thanks for this piece: it is a &lt;i&gt;great&lt;/i&gt; one, yet it&#8217;s within reach of a beginning pianist. (That&#8217;s not to undercut the task of learning it. Any pianist who has learned to play it well ought to be proud of their accomplishment! It is not in any way a trivial thing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I abhor the idea that material for beginners should be &lt;i&gt;dumbed down.&lt;/i&gt; Simplicity is necessary, but simplicity need not be dumb. We are especially guilty of doing this to children, but it happens to beginners of all ages. It&#8217;s kind of bait and switch: somebody loves music so much that they find the courage to start taking lessons, then we give them music that&#8217;s not worth loving, holding off the &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; stuff until they&#8217;re more advanced. It&#8217;s disrespectful, and it&#8217;s counterproductive: the lessons of substance and meaning do not need to follow years and years after the lessons of reading and technique. We do the same thing with reading, with math &#8212; especially with math! &#8212;&#160;oh, don&#8217;t get me started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see it as a challenge to us composers: Chopin, who wrote some of the most difficult piano music out there, managed to produce this music of tremendous depth without needing to make it tremendously difficult. If he can do it, why can&#8217;t we?  OK, actually, making something both great and simple is one of the most difficult artistic challenges there is, but it&#8217;s also one of the worthiest. Lauren certainly knows that: the best picture books can tell compelling stories that tackle layered, subtle, and difficult ideas using only a very few words and elemental artwork, and they are powerful for their simplicity. Her gorgeous &lt;a href="http://www.laurenstringer.com/books/witws/witws1.html"&gt;latest book&lt;/a&gt; is a nice essay on how the choices we make in our perception of reality shape that reality and our lives &#8212;&#160;though she says it much more simply, and more effectively!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve paired the E minor prelude with the E major one. The latter is a bit more difficult (mostly because of the wider stretches), but is also within a dedicated beginner&#8217;s reach, and also a great one. It has a wonderful chord progression, and a very interesting structure: we set out from the same point of departure three times (0:00, 0:28, 0:58), each time finding a new path with newly surprising modulations. I learned these two preludes one after the other, and think they make a great segue. I do like the big contrasts!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention, beginners, would-be beginners, and especially those who say, &#8220;Oh, I wish I could learn to play the piano! But I&#8217;m just too old / too busy / too tonedeaf / too whatever.&#8221; Rubbish! Balderdash! Pish, piffle, and poppycock! It is never too late to start. Be bold! Lauren was; you can be too. Great music is not out of your reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nomade &#224; Clef</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&#8217;t usually write jazz tunes, but my friend Todd asked me to write one for him. It sounded like fun, and he had written &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/6"&gt;several great pieces&lt;/a&gt; for me, so I took up the challenge. &lt;i&gt;Nomade &#224; Clef&lt;/i&gt; is the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd premiered it at &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2007/01/19/123/"&gt;this year&#8217;s Keys Please&lt;/a&gt;, with David Edminster on tenor sax, and I think they did just a marvelous job with it. They really made it fly. I only wrote a lead sheet (just melody and chords)&#160;with a bare-bones piano part underneath to suggest voicings in the piano &#8212; the rest of the work is theirs, including Todd&#8217;s solo intro and all of David&#8217;s development of the melody. I feel like this recording is their piece more than mine &#8230; and that feeling is a good one, the pleasure of a successful handoff. I suppose this is the nature of jazz? No, it is the nature of all music written by one person and performed by another, no matter how explicitly notated or how little improvised: in playing music, if we play it well, we necessarily make it our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recorded live in concert, here is&#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Manic Dance (rough)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things may have been quiet on the blog, but I&#8217;ve been doing tons of music work lately. The recent round of &lt;a href="http://innig.net/zo/"&gt;Zo&lt;/a&gt; went well: I took a bit of a risk playing mostly pieces that were fresh out of the practice oven (or, in a couple of cases, still baking), but people seemed to enjoy it, and I was certainly satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you want to know about future concerts, you should get on the &lt;a href="http://innig.net/zo/subscribe.jsp"&gt;mailing list&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerts done, I&#8217;m now composing day and night, quite productively. I now have a complete first draft of my set of dances! The last big obstacle was a sort of &#8220;keystone moment&#8221; in the piece, where everything has to come together &lt;i&gt;just so&lt;/i&gt; &#8212; but with some dogged persistence and late nights, I pushed through and filled in the final hole in the cycle. It&#8217;s very exciting; I&#8217;ve been working on them since forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I have a complete draft, however, a huge amount of work remains: there&#8217;s a lot of refining and revising, practicing, and polishing the interpretation necessary in order to get a really good recording together. It will be a good long while before you can hear the full cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&#8217;m recording rough versions of the pieces as I learn to play them. I always hesitate a bit to do that, because the rough versions are, in fact, &lt;i&gt;rough&lt;/i&gt;, and don&#8217;t completely convey the ideas of the music. There&#8217;s always a danger that the ideas will be so muddled that the music will just sound like a jumble of notes. Performance really matters!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I don&#8217;t like the alternative of not sharing anything until it&#8217;s perfect; I&#8217;d rather keep people at least somewhat in the loop on what I&#8217;ve been doing &#8212;&#160;partly because folks seem to enjoy it, and partly because I&#8217;m eager to share! Enough of the music comes through in these rough versions, I think, to let you in on the fun of watching the whole cycle emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, then, here&#8217;s one I finished writing a couple of months ago and am now playing somewhat successfully. It was a hit with the audience at Zo. As per the warning above: the performance is not yet completely assured: you&#8217;ll hear me struggling for notes in some spots. Use your imagination a bit, and pretend it&#8217;s rock-solid steady. Or just pretend it rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/3"&gt;Paul Cantrell&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Manic Dance (rough version)&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/3"&gt;Paul Cantrell&lt;/a&gt;,
piano
&lt;br&gt;
&#9835;

(2:32 / 3.7 M)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound at the beginning is a whack from the music desk being pushed back. After that, throughout the piece, you&#8217;ll hear fingertips damping the strings &#8212; sometimes after the hammer strikes and sometimes as it strikes. I love that sound, and this &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2004/12/11/48/"&gt;isn&#8217;t the first time I&#8217;ve used it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keys Please is Feb 2, 2007</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Can this really be the sixth year? Groundhog Day approaches fast, and that means it&#8217;s time for Keys Please!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carei Thomas, Todd Harper and I have been running this annual tradition of a playful, genre-bending celebration of keyboard music since 2001, and by golly, I think we&#8217;ve got something special going. It shows a slightly different side of my musical life than &lt;i&gt;In the Hands&lt;/i&gt;, and it&#8217;s unlike any other concert I know of. For those of you who don&#8217;t know about Keys Please, Minnesota Public Radio did a &lt;a href="http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2006/02/01_combsm_keysplease/"&gt;wonderful feature&lt;/a&gt; on last year&#8217;s concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year&#8217;s special guest is David Edminster, who is mostly a tenor sax player, but will also be slipping in some bassoon and clarinet. The guy has got some serious jazz in him; you don&#8217;t want to miss this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keys Please 6: The Reckoning&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Friday, February 2 - 8:00 PM&lt;br&gt;Janet Wallace Concert Hall&lt;br&gt;Macalester College, St. Paul, MN&lt;br&gt;$10 at the door / all students free&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks from today. Reckon I&#8217;ll see you there? Hope so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href="http://innig.net/press/keysplease6/kp6-flyer.pdf"&gt;Here&#8217;s a flyer&lt;/a&gt; you can stick on your fridge, or wear as a hat. Print it out, cut it in half, and give one to a friend! Thanks to &lt;a href="http://www.geocities.com/wvelezart/fonts.html"&gt;Walter Velez&lt;/a&gt; for the very cool font.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bach Sinfonia 5 and Schumann Bunte Bl&#228;tter 6 (remastered)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As regular readers of &lt;i&gt;In the Hands&lt;/i&gt; know, I&#8217;ve been working through my older recordings and applying my up-to-date mastering process &#8212; making them sound better, in other words. As I went through the list, I found that these two recordings make a nice pair. Arranging nice little transitions like this is one of my favorite parts of doing a concert. It&#8217;s the same little pleasure as assembling a mix CD or playing DJ: even the simple act of ordering songs is a kind of composition, and carries the joy of being creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keys of the two pieces (E flat and A flat) are related and make for a smooth transition, but beyond that, it&#8217;s hard to pin down what exactly connects them so well. The deliberate, thoughtful way both unfold? The way both of them seem to talk? Their sense of intimacy? Those are all getting warm, but none of them really pin it down. It doesn&#8217;t matter, though &#8212;&#160;it is fine to be musically confident on intuition alone, and I say they fit. Phooey to the 20th century and its obsession with having a conscious rationale for everything in music!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When something musical works well, it&#8217;s natural to wonder why, and we learn a great deal in the process of trying to come up with explanations. But our musical explanations (like all models of reality) are always incomplete; good music remains half-submerged in the unknown, and thus always carries the magic shared by all mysterious things. This is the dilemma of a performer and, even more, of a composer: constantly dissecting, looking for order, developing explanations and rationales &#8212; and at the same time never losing sight of the incompleteness of these explanations, but embracing the unknown and holding on to the magic. The skill of smoothly changing frame between reasoning and intuition, known and unknown, dissected part and organic whole, is a core part of both composition and computer programming. Those are two things I spent a lot of my time doing, and I claim they overlap a great deal in the brain, in large part because of this &#8220;frame shifting.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, right, I had a recording to share. Enough philosophizing. On with the music!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

(2:06 / 2.9 M)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These both come from wonderful sets of pieces &#8212; Bach&#8217;s two- and three-part inventions, and Schumann&#8217;s &lt;i&gt;Albumbl&#228;tter&lt;/i&gt; (&#8220;Album Leaves,&#8221; which is a subset of &lt;i&gt;Bunte Bl&#228;tter&lt;/i&gt;, &#8220;Colored Leaves&#8221;). I&#8217;d like to learn more of both sets (and improve my Bach playing in general, because it&#8217;s very weak). Too much great music and not enough time! What&#8217;s a fellow to do?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Todd Harper: Questions</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it would have been better if I&#8217;d just admitted to myself (and the world) that I&#8217;d be taking the summer off from &lt;i&gt;In the Hands&lt;/i&gt;. But where&#8217;s the fun without the suspense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&#8217;s what I currently have in the pipeline (not necessarily in this order):&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some newly composed pieces of my own.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A new recording of at least some part of &lt;i&gt;The Broken Mirror of Memory&lt;/i&gt;, my bass clarinet / piano work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A fine new recording from Don Betts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The remaining remasterings of my older recordings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8230;And that&#8217;s my autumn of music pretty well booked up right there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, however, is the last of the three songs by Todd that Kim and I recorded last spring. This one is a setting of a poem by local poet John Minczeski, &lt;i&gt;Questions&lt;/i&gt;, which&#160;sits somewhere between Zen koan and children&#8217;s book. It is a single poem, but Todd has split it into four separate little songs, zooming in on each each question and giving it its own character. I think they&#8217;re quite marvelous. It&#8217;s a wonderful way to read a poem &#8212; as the Internet makes us more accustomed to reading text fast, the music makes it possible to slow down and give each line of the poem its own space and weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/6"&gt;Todd Harper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Questions&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/11"&gt;Kim Sueoka&lt;/a&gt;,
soprano
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/12"&gt;John Minczeski&lt;/a&gt;,
words
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/3"&gt;Paul Cantrell&lt;/a&gt;,
piano
&lt;br&gt;
&#9835;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/recordings/ith_harper_questions.mp3"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
(2:19 / 3.3 M)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the last of Todd&#8217;s songs Kim and I have recorded together; it&#8217;s back to solo piano in the next episode. Be sure to also check out &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2006/05/10/115/"&gt;Northwoods Police Report&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2006/04/16/114/"&gt;First Autumn Night&lt;/a&gt; if you haven&#8217;t already!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Internet and the Future of Art</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, I lead a session at &lt;a href="http://barcamp.org/MinneBar"&gt;MinneBar&lt;/a&gt; in which I talked about my experiences producing &lt;i&gt;In the Hands&lt;/i&gt;, my sense of the past relationships between art and society, and my wishes for the future. The audience joined in, and it was a very interesting 40 minutes of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Wilson has very kindly made an &lt;a href="http://technosavvy.org/?p=408"&gt;audio recording of the session&lt;/a&gt; available on &lt;a href="http://technosavvy.org/"&gt;They Savvy Technologist&lt;/a&gt;. He did a good job of capturing a very interactive session with only a single mic in a noisy room. Well done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If any of you want to follow along with the session, here are slightly cleaned up versions of the two &#8220;idea map&#8221; diagrams you&#8217;ll hear me producing on my Powerbook during the session:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/images/inthehands/music-causality-20c.pdf"&gt;20th century&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 82k)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/images/inthehands/music-causality-21c.pdf"&gt;21st century&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 80k)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that these are rough, still in process, and entirely up for discussion. I&#8217;m still figuring all of this out, along with the rest of the world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a pleasure doing the session, and a pleasure attending the conference. I&#8217;m grateful to all who planned and sponsored it! If there&#8217;s a &lt;a href="http://barcamp.org"&gt;BarCamp&lt;/a&gt; in your area, I highly recommend checking it out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Northwoods Police Report</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a cold (which left my voice in bad shape for podcasting) and &lt;a href="http://barcamp.org/MinneBarSessions"&gt;MinneBar&lt;/a&gt; (which was a great pleasure), it&#8217;s back to &lt;i&gt;In the Hands!&lt;/i&gt; I&#8217;m continuing from &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2006/04/16/114/"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt; the series of recordings I made recently with soprano Kim Sueoka of songs by Todd Harper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For several years, Todd has been writing songs full of the sort of jazz changes that are his roots, but as much in the tradition of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lieder"&gt;lieder&lt;/a&gt; as anything. He always makes them short, sweet, and very focused &#8212; haiku-like &#8212; and when he&#8217;s setting a text longer than a few lines, he&#8217;ll often break it into a chain of very short songs, each only a few words long. I don&#8217;t know of anybody who does anything quite like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four songs of this short cycle are almost a sort of &#8220;found haiku&#8221; &#8212; the text is from actual police reports in an unnamed northern Minnesota town. Yes, they are real. No, Todd will not tell you which town it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&#8217;re absolutely hilarious &#8212; Kim does a perfect deadpan delivery of their painfully earnest description of the mundane and mildly ridiculous things the police in a small town have to deal with. Audiences have different reactions to the humor: when we did them at an &lt;a href="http://www.composersforum.org/programs_detail.cfm?oid=4601"&gt;ACF Tuesday Salon&lt;/a&gt;, the very polite &#8220;high art crowd&#8221; audience murmured appreciatively at the humor, but seemed to be waiting for permission to laugh; when we did them shortly afterwards at &lt;a href="http://www.patrickscabaret.org/"&gt;Patrick&#8217;s Cabaret&lt;/a&gt;, the audience let out such an incredible stream of roars and guffaws, we were barely able to stay together!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s something in them beyond the humor, however: a sweetness, a tender love for the world of a small towns. Our sense of scale is relative in all things &#8212; space, time, what&#8217;s important &#8212; and in a little town, a disheveled stranger, a fence knocked down &#8230; these things &lt;i&gt;matter&lt;/i&gt;. Todd lets the humor in, but it&#8217;s not mocking &#8212; it&#8217;s tender. He&#8217;s laughing about what he loves, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

      <title>First Autumn Night</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here, for the first time in a long time, is something I wrote &#8212; but it&#8217;s not the music!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, I recorded some of my friend Todd Harper&#8217;s songs with &lt;a href="http://www.kimsueoka.com/"&gt;Kim Sueoka&lt;/a&gt;, a marvelous local soprano who sings with (among others) the &lt;a href="http://www.roseensemble.org/"&gt;Rose Ensemble&lt;/a&gt; and a first-rate voice/guitar duo called &lt;a href="http://kimsueoka.com/_wsn/page5.html"&gt;Voce y Cuerdas&lt;/a&gt;. She&#8217;s great, Todd&#8217;s great, and by golly, we had a wonderful time making the recordings!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd mostly writes voice / piano duets &#8212; and that&#8217;s mostly what we recorded &#8212; but he also did a lovely &lt;i&gt;a cappella&lt;/i&gt; setting of one of &lt;a href="http://innig.net/poems/"&gt;my poems&lt;/a&gt;, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m publishing first. The poem is short, and so is the song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/6"&gt;Todd Harper&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;First Autumn Night&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/11"&gt;Kim Sueoka&lt;/a&gt;,
soprano
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/3"&gt;Paul Cantrell&lt;/a&gt;,
words
&lt;br&gt;
&#9835;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/recordings/ith_harper_autumn.mp3"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
(0:26 / 1.0 M)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The poem is a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku"&gt;haiku&lt;/a&gt;. Syllable-counters in the audience may object that the lines do not follow the 5-7-5 pattern haiku are supposed to follow, but the syllable count rule isn&#8217;t important in modern English haiku, and many poets ignore it altogether. It only really makes sense in Japanese &#8212; English syllables are a very different ilk from their Japanese cousins. Moreover, the syllable count isn&#8217;t really the heart of the form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the heart, then, you ask? A haiku is a direct experience, a single moment of perception caught before the mind has fully digested perception into narrative and meaning. It is typically tied to nature, often tied to a season*, but these are both optional in modern haiku. Perhaps most important feature is that the haiku has two parts: first a direct perception, then some second perception or mental twist that deepens the first part or casts it in a new light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The separation between the two halves is a significant moment. In this song, Todd renders it ("halo") with the highest note, and the snaking, tonally shifting, rising melody of the first part (the autumn night, the moon) becomes sweet, diatonic, and falling (the illusion of the halo). Nicely done, Todd. And nicely done, Kim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More songs to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;* OK, I know it&#8217;s not autumn here in the Northern Hemisphere. You caught me.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Carei Thomas: The Usual Topic</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a second selection from this year&#8217;s &lt;i&gt;Keys Please&lt;/i&gt; to follow Todd&#8217;s little &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2006/03/23/112/"&gt;musical rattlesnake adventure&lt;/a&gt;. This is an improvisation by Carei Thomas, the rattlesnake&#8217;s narrator, now on piano. I thought &#8212; and he said afterward &#8212; that there was a little nod to &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/category/recordings/improvisations/"&gt;my own funny little improvs&lt;/a&gt; in this one, especially in the way it starts with a very low note and a very high one &#8230; but it&#8217;s definitely a Carei thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some improvs have a definite form (head-solo-head, fugue, tala) or a definitely style (Dixieland, bebop, Ghanaian drumming) &#8230; but this is one of those that&#8217;s just completely spontaneous and organic, and grew out of silence in a completely organic way &#8212; like a spring daffodil poking its head up through the jumbled twigs and dead leaves. Todd and I actually murmured to one another during the applause, &#8220;Oo! Where did that come from?&#8221; Only Carei knows, I suppose, and maybe not even him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/10"&gt;Carei Thomas&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Usual Topic&lt;/b&gt;

(2:27 / 3.4 M)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took care of my girlfriend Paige&#8217;s pet parakeet Pegasus recently while her landlord did some emergency plumbing work, and Pegasus joined in one day while I was practicing the piano. It was not the standard chirping, but a complex mix of all sorts of sounds Pegasus doesn&#8217;t normally make, which followed the music quite well &#8211; louder in the loud parts and softer in the soft, somehow matching the texture and fitting into the spaces in a birdsong sort of way. It was like she was a soloing on my material &#8212; a really wonderful bit of inter-species improv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to capture it in a recording the next time I practiced, but she wasn&#8217;t as interested in the piano that time. Too bad! I did, however, manage to capture a bit of a human singer on the microphones, which I will share next time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Todd Harper: Rattlesnake Song #2</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things don&#8217;t look good for me to create more new piano recordings in my home studio in the immediate future, so I&#8217;m going to have to stall &#8212; but I figure I might at least stall with something good!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a piece from &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2006/01/31/109/"&gt;the most recent &lt;i&gt;Keys Please!&lt;/i&gt; concert&lt;/a&gt;. It adds a nice little bit of variation to the blog: not only is it not Cantrell, Chopin, or Brahms, but &#8230; it doesn&#8217;t even have a piano in it! (Yes, I&#8217;m really going out on a limb.) It&#8217;s also stylistically different from what I&#8217;ve published so far, hopefully in a refreshing way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s from my buddy Todd. He says of it:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[This song] I have to share credit for, because I did not write the words. I was at my mom&#8217;s at Thanksgiving, and I found some old articles my dad wrote when he was alive, for the newspaper, the &lt;i&gt;Forest Lake Times&lt;/i&gt; &#8212; and they&#8217;re about snakes. &#8230; This is about an expedition he took, and I thought, &#8220;This would set really well for cello and voice.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd uses some inspired bits of semi-improvised sound painting, beautifully performed by Jacqueline, to accentuate the miniature drama in Carei&#8217;s reading of this little story. I hope you&#8217;ll find it as charming as I do!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/6"&gt;Todd Harper&lt;/a&gt;

      <title>Exciting! New! Read all about it!</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve added a two new things to my web site that may be of interest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Music-Only Podcast&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you not up on all the tech-y stuff, this site has a &#8220;podcast&#8221; &#8212; a feature that lets your computer automatically download the music and save it to your music library or portable music player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, the podcast has featured a spoken version of the written commentary that goes with each piece. This works well for people listening, say, at the gym or in their car. However, while you might want to listen to the music over and over, I really doubt you want to hear my introductions all that often. (My voice is just not that exciting.) Because the podcast always included the commentary, people who wanted &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; the music still had to manually download each track. &lt;a href="http://iotae.net/"&gt;Aaron&lt;/a&gt; wisely suggested that I do a music-only podcast as well. It&#8217;s a great idea, and I finally got around to doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now, over on the right (under the &#8220;Syndication&#8221; heading), you&#8217;ll see two links: one for a podcast with commentary, and one with only the music:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are listening on the go, and want a radio-show-like format with spoken commentary, subscribe to the &lt;a href="pcast://innig.net/music/inthehands/feed/rss2/"&gt;podcast with commentary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to automatically download just the music to add it to your listening library, subscribe to the &lt;a href="pcast://innig.net/music/inthehands/feed/rss2/?podcast=music"&gt;music-only podcast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And heck, if you want the spoken commentary for the first listen &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the music for future listening, well, subscribe to both!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recording Method Explanation Updated&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;i&gt;finally&lt;/i&gt; updated my &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/recordings/method/"&gt;description of how I make my recordings&lt;/a&gt; to reflect all of the work I did last year to improve the mastering process. Although I made revisions throughout that whole area of the site, the bulk of the new information is in the &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/recordings/method/mastering.html"&gt;section on mastering&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is primarily of interest to others making their own recordings, but may also be of idle interest to anyone who is curious what goes into producing the finished product you hear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Brahms Intermezzo 117.2 (remastered)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ahoy there. It&#8217;s been a while! I&#8217;ve been busy. It&#8217;s a sad fact of life that I have bills to pay, and in spite of the tremendous generosity of some of this podcast&#8217;s listeners, a whole year&#8217;s worth of donations to &lt;i&gt;In the Hands&lt;/i&gt; don&#8217;t even cover a month&#8217;s rent. So, I&#8217;ve been working &#8212; which is not entirely a bad thing: it&#8217;s a good job, I like the other people, and I&#8217;m working on interesting stuff &#8230; but it&#8217;s just amazing how much time a job takes! Forty hours a week is a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, having settled in to the new schedule of this job, solved my car woes, completed another successful &lt;i&gt;Keys Please&lt;/i&gt;, and done some traveling (I went to Qu&#233;bec and practiced my French!), I&#8217;m now turning my attention back to my poor, neglected site. To get things started again, here&#8217;s an old recording freshly remastered with the new process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a late Brahms intermezzo. (Regular readers know how much I love that!) As I &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2004/10/12/35/"&gt;wrote before&lt;/a&gt;, it&#8217;s a wonderfully ambiguous piece. I suppose not everybody might think of ambiguity as being a compliment or a desirable thing, but I do. One of music&#8217;s magical abilities is to be ambiguous in the way that life is ambiguous, that the moment-to-moment experience of consciousness is ambiguous. We have a very natural desire to &lt;i&gt;understand&lt;/i&gt; music, to try to figure out what it &#8220;means&#8221; and what we&#8217;re supposed to think about it. Music, however, doesn&#8217;t like to be pigeonholed that way. In real life, we don&#8217;t experience emotions one at a time, or in black and white &#8212; we usually make sense of them in retrospect, finding names and narratives only as we look back on experience. Music works that way as well, and gives us a way of distilling and becoming comfortable with all the confusingly multiple moment-to-moment ebb and flow of our minds and hearts. It is a way of looking back on our own experience without flattening it the way ordinary words can. It&#8217;s often hard to say even whether a piece is basically happy or sad &#8212; and that is a wonderful thing if you embrace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Certainly embracing it is certainly necessary in this piece. It&#8217;s hard to say exactly what it is, or what it&#8217;s about, or to name how it feels, but the raw experience of it &#8212; if we don&#8217;t try to name it &#8212; is wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up, I&#8217;ll be sharing some excerpts from February&#8217;s &lt;i&gt;Keys Please&lt;/i&gt;, which will be a fun change of pace for &lt;i&gt;In the Hands&lt;/i&gt;. There will even be instruments other than piano; brace yourselves!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Keys Please is this weekend!</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the Hands&lt;/i&gt; will come back to life soon. I&#8217;m getting settled into my new job (which is a good thing: nice people, interesting problems), and I&#8217;ve sorted out the &#8220;sudden car death&#8221; crisis that&#8217;s been eating up lots of time lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, if you&#8217;d like a sneak preview of the two Chopin nocturnes I&#8217;m planning to record, come to my concert this weekend:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keys Please: The Untold Story&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Saturday, February 4 - 8:00 PM&lt;br&gt;Janet Wallace Concert Hall&lt;br&gt;Macalester College, St. Paul, MN&lt;br&gt;$10 at the door / all students free&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be a grand time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, to whet your appetite: MPR&#8217;s excellent &lt;a href="http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/tools/search/author/author_collection.php?id=12"&gt;Marianne Combs&lt;/a&gt; did a &lt;a href="http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2006/02/01_combsm_keysplease/"&gt;wonderful interview with us about Keys Please&lt;/a&gt;. You can read the text of story on the site, but I &lt;i&gt;strongly&lt;/i&gt; recommend listening to the web audio if you can &#8212; the sounds add a great deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview sounds so natural as I listen, it&#8217;s easy to forget how rare this is: an interview that the interviewee likes, that captures what is important and hones right in on the essence of the subject. That&#8217;s hard enough in world news, harder still where art is concerned. (True, she pronounces my last name wrong, but she did such a great job capturing the spirit of Keys Please that I&#8217;ll forgive her &lt;i&gt;ten times over&lt;/i&gt;.) We musicians should always be so lucky. Thanks a million, Marianne!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A new audio logo!</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long hiatus. It&#8217;s been a busy time: my latest sabbatical is running to its end, I&#8217;m broke, and back to job hunting. So I&#8217;ve been having to put aside the music and be all practical lately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, I have not left In the Hands completely neglected. Listening to some other podcasts &#8212; and some of those old school &#8230; what are they called? &#8230; oh yes, &lt;i&gt;radio shows&lt;/i&gt; &#8212; I noticed what a difference a really nice audio logo or theme song makes. It functions as an announcement, of course: &#8220;Pay attention! Your show is on!&#8221; And it&#8217;s a cue to get in the right frame of mind to enjoy what&#8217;s coming next. But most of all, I realized I love the &lt;i&gt;ritual&lt;/i&gt; of the theme song, the anticipation and cozy excitement that comes from the conditioning of hearing the same theme again and again. It&#8217;s amazing how deep that conditioning goes: though they are from my single-digit years, my heartbeat still involuntarily quickens when I hear &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/titles/drwho4.shtml"&gt;these unmistakable sounds&lt;/a&gt;! (Yay for &lt;a href="http://www.delia-derbyshire.org/"&gt;Delia Derbyshire&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick is, I don&#8217;t want a tune that&#8217;s so catchy it interferes with the music I&#8217;m about to play; my opening music needs to have a sort of palate-cleansing effect. I decided the thing to do was to make a collage of several different pieces, to get you in that piano mood without a piano tune in your head. &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/recordings/ith_audio-logo.mp3"&gt;Here&#8217;s the what I came up with.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This new audio logo won&#8217;t make much difference to those of you reading the text version, but for those listening to the podcast, &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/recordings/ith_cantrell-lost-things_commentary.mp3"&gt;here&#8217;s how it sounds&lt;/a&gt; as part of an episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(For those of you who didn&#8217;t even &lt;i&gt;know&lt;/i&gt; there&#8217;s an audio version of this commentary, here are &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2005/09/15/97/"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt; for subscribing in iTunes.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Song for Lost Things (rough)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m doing something today that I haven&#8217;t done in far too long: sharing a recording of a new composition in progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;ve been working for some time on a set of piano pieces, all of them dances in one way or another &#8212; and all of them, in one way or another, full of the feeling of entropy, full of things falling apart and things slipping away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This particular one has much sweetness in it, but its main ingredient is ambiguity. Its different layers are centered in different keys, different places. They mesh so that a note which sounds unresolved in its own layer often harmonizes with what is going on in a layer above or below &#8212; and then when that note resolves within its own layer, it must move away from resolution with respect to that other layer it seemed to agree with a moment ago. This means that the layers are always pulling against each other, entwined but tugging in different directions, and the music is always simultaneously both resolving and unresolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this all happens quickly, and it&#8217;s hard to hear all these little individual motions. Instead, it all blends together to give the music a restless, floating, perpetually suspended quality. The music does eventually find a place to rest, but it&#8217;s fleeting &#8212; remember: falling apart, slipping away &#8212; ah, but I&#8217;m giving away too much! I&#8217;ll let the music tell its own story:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/3"&gt;Paul Cantrell&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Song For Lost Things (slightly rough version)&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

(2:58 / 3.9 M)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still haven&#8217;t fully worked out the interpretation, so I&#8217;m calling this performance &#8220;slightly rough:&#8221; as I live with the music for a while, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll find that I want to play some things differently. It may come as a surprise, but even with the things I write, I still have to go through the same careful process of interpretation, figuring out how the music works, and how to play it just &lt;i&gt;so&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are nine pieces in the whole set, of which I&#8217;ve posted this one and four others in rough form: &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2004/10/02/29/"&gt;Entropic Waltz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2005/02/01/71/"&gt;Dance for Remembering and Forgetting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2004/09/25/24/"&gt;Cradle Waltz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/inthehands/2005/03/20/83/"&gt;Disembodied Dance&lt;/a&gt;. Wish me luck learning the rest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt; Here&#8217;s the &lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/scores/emptyshore/lost-things.pdf"&gt;score&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Chopin Nocturne 15.2 (remastered)</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had a request for &#8220;MORE CHOPIN!&#8221; which made me realize that I&#8217;ve been neglecting the poor fellow &#8212; and he&#8217;s such a favorite of mine!  I&#8217;ve been working on two new Chopin nocturnes, and I&#8217;ll hopefully be ready to record them soon. In the meantime, however, here&#8217;s one I&#8217;ve played for a long time, in a freshly remastered recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like what I wrote about this piece when I posted this recording in its earlier, less acoustically pristine form, so I&#8217;ll say it again: It&#8217;s organic, and sounds almost improvised &#8212; except that it is impossibly perfect in every detail. Its soundscape is vast, deep, and richly pianistic, but look at the construction and you&#8217;ll see the spare elegance of Bach. It has a loving tenderness, and a longing, that&#8217;s unlike anything else, yet seems instantly familiar. And it&#8217;s gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/1"&gt;Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Chopin&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Nocturne Op 15 No 2 (in F sharp major)&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/artists/3"&gt;Paul Cantrell&lt;/a&gt;,
piano
&lt;br&gt;
&#9835;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href="http://innig.net/music/recordings/ith_chopin-15-2.mp3"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
(4:32 / 5.8 M)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s nothing quite like learning to play a piece of music to really get &lt;i&gt;inside&lt;/i&gt; it. With this one, like many I&#8217;ve shared here, I knew it was excellent music before I started learning it &#8212; but once I&#8217;m inside it, once I&#8217;m feeling through the piece with my own hands and working through its many parts with the microscope of learning, once I really start to &#8220;get it&#8221; about the music &#8230; it&#8217;s just &lt;i&gt;staggering&lt;/i&gt; how good it is. It just floors me. I don&#8217;t know how much of that comes across in my playing &#8212; certainly I&#8217;m only communicating a small shadow of that experience &#8212; but I hope you can share my sense of wonder that we have this music in our world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
