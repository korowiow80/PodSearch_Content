Greetings Loyal Listeners!
Welcome to our 'InGeneral - Around The World' Special. As you know, we're all about the specials these days, however, this one requires a notice of clarification = We.Were.SMASHED! And I don't mean, we just had 'a few' drinks, I mean we were dead set shitfaced.
Soooo, apologies in advance for the drunken ramblings! But we did manage to fit in the words MANUAL PENILE STIMULATION. Fascinating no?
Enjoy! And thanks for being a part of our little corner of shenanigans.
Wally.</description>

Hey All!
Yet another special for you to audibly devour, this time squarely taking aim at some of the more questionable efforts in TV and Cinema. This special could've gone for hours, luckily myself, Alex C and Todd couldn't be stuffed quite frankly as we were pretty smashed. Jokes.
But enjoy anyway &quot;InGeneral's Shitful Efforts in TV &amp; Cinema&quot;!
Cheers,
Wally.</description>

Welcooommme baaaaaaaack!
Hey listeners! As promised we are back for the first episode of our 3 special series. For those who need updating we have moved away from new episodes every 2 weeks and put a concentrated effort into specials. After all, you don't need our questionable behaviour and ill-informed talk pounding your ear drums every fortnight... Sooo, we have 3 episodes heading your way, this first one &quot;Something Old, Something New&quot; is a beautifully crafted mixed platter of sketches for you, old and new, mostly new of course. Next episode will be &quot;Something Borrowed, Something Blue&quot;, a mixture of stand up and get this, a porn movie review! FINALLY! Then to cap it all off, our &quot;Xmas Special&quot; as always. Oh, btw- the language in this one is not edited, I repeat, blue talk is all over this episode. We've come to realise our audience know what they're in for :) 
Enjoy!
Wally.</description>

My goodness, I have to state from the outset this episode is probably not one for the kids, not that any episode if InGeneral should ever be exposed to minors, yet, something about this episode set the tone for a story from Alex C that even I had to edit severely, seriously, you just gotta check it out to see what I mean.
PLUS PLUS PLUS! I've popped a bit of a bonus on the end of this episode for you, us blokes at InGeneral work on this awesome net station called X92. I believe that it will be back up and running shortly with it's new and improved net stationy goodness. Sooo, we got our music geek hats on again and are bringing you this exclusive X92 'Re-Hash Re-Mash'. A collection of mash-ups that we've re-worked to our devious liking along with our own extra creations...
Enjoy and have a Happy Easter!

We steady the ship for season 3 with this official episode '2'. We shoot the breeze on Olympics, Tiger (sigh) Woods, and various antics from around the worls, funnily enough in a segment titled 'Around the World'. Not to mention having a right royal whinge at the retail sector and dicuss the chances of us still having our 'mojo'. Anyhoo, it's all here in episode 29! (Well, not really, but.... metaphorically).
Enjoy!

      <title>InGeneral: 'Choice Cuts - The Best of Season 2' For Download!</title>

Finally! We've scoured the last season and filtered all the B grade dodgy comedy out, and placed it straight into the 'Best of Seaon 2'. It's a roller coaster ride of emotions, personal information that you could've done without and all the bits you can't wait to hear again. You'll laugh, you'll cry (probably at the same time), you'll be driven to drink with this 1hr 35min drain of your personal time. We can't wait to get stuck into Season 3, so let's get this unnecessary heap of reminisence out of the way shall we!
Cheers,
Wally.</description>

How's it goin? Really?.. Hmmm, that's too bad, a bit of cream will clear that right up...
Anyhoooo, welcome to our first little B-Sides episode! We have so much material left over every episode that I thought I'd do a 'MacGyver' and just grab a bunch of random shit and try and make something cool out of it. I'll let you be the judge! We've got dogs on trains, bird watchers gettin randy, criminal poetry plus myself &amp; Alex C abuse J.B's insane knowledge of who invented what. Not to mention I've thrown in some fantastic Robin Williams in England stand up for your enjoyment as well as our latest travel segment.
Enjoy!
Cheers,
Wally.</description>

So anyway, after bludgeoning your ears with over an hour of InGeneral 'Best Of' stuff last episode, we thought we'd pump out a nice short one this week. JB is moving house, so Sean took over the buttons and rocked them hard... in his own unprepared style. We discover Alex C's penchant for getting his kit off for the neighbours, every school boy's fantasy has nearly come to life for Sean, Negative Man makes a triumphantly pessimistic return and InGeneral TV remains on the front foot of cutting edge television. Enjoy!

Sammy J is saying 'Sayonara Bitches', so, we thought we'd give you a nice little re-cap of our first Season and guaruntee to come back better than ever for episode 19! (not a guaruntee).

Bonjour!... (Thought I'd give myself a little class in this episodes blurb... I think it went well...) Soooo, Episode 14 eh? 14, it's a great number, it looks good, it's double the number 7 which is incidentally the amount of Police Academy movies that have been made. My favourite being 'City Under Siege', where that bloke who does the sound effects pretends to be a robot and the crook totally falls for it and the blokes all like &quot;bizzzzt...shooooooshzzzt....beep beep..&quot; and the crook's all like &quot;Wha heyyy! Runnnn!&quot; Heheheh....classic. Anyhoo, Ep 14 is rockin' out like a drunk uncle at a wedding, Negative Man is back, and this time.. it's not positive for a change. Newsdesk returns tackling the big issues, high quality tunes from 'Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem' (chili pepper fans will appreciate the reference) and Josh Pyke. Plus of course, myself, Sammy J, Alex C, Sean &amp; JB return for some more tooling around... Get it into ya!  </description>

Bonjour!... (Thought I'd give myself a little class in this episodes blurb... I think it went well...) Soooo, Episode 14 eh? 14, it's a great number, it looks good, it's double the number 7 which is incidentally the amount of Police Academy movies that have been made. My favourite being 'City Under Siege', where that bloke who does the sound effects pretends to be a robot and the crook totally falls for it and the blokes all like &quot;bizzzzt...shooooooshzzzt....beep beep..&quot; and the crook's all like &quot;Wha heyyy! Runnnn!&quot; Heheheh....classic. Anyhoo, Ep 14 is rockin' out like a drunk uncle at a wedding, Negative Man is back, and this time.. it's not positive for a change. Newsdesk returns tackling the big issues, high quality tunes from 'Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem' (chili pepper fans will appreciate the reference) and Josh Pyke. Plus of course, myself, Sammy J, Alex C, Sean &amp; JB return for some more tooling around... Get it into ya!  </itunes:summary>

Hey Kids! Oooooh, Episode 13! Scary...... and stuff. Anyhoo, we here at the InGeneral offices feel it's time for a change... a change we can believe in... I got that from this guy I know over in America, reckons he was going to run for President or something... wonder how he went, he hasn't called or anything, oh well, good luck to him. Sooooo, we were thinking that 12 episodes is as good a number as any to round off a first series. So, this episode we're gonna give you a little break from the norm and churn out a bonus episode. We're also thinking, if you lot like it then we'll make it a regular thing. Myself and Sammy J caught up with the other serial offenders that pop into the show from time to time; J.B., Alex C &amp; Sean(all over) and basically waffled on for a while.... yep, that's it... we reeealy extended ourselves this time. Enjoy!</description>

After a short delay due to a brief screening for swine flu, we've served up this latest installment from behind face masks. Not that the result at the doctors turned out positive, we just think they look cool (he did however find some questionable spots, but the cream should clear those right up.....what... I meant acne...get your mind out of the gutter, c'mon we're not &quot;that&quot; kind of show). Sneezed up for your enjoyment this episode is some brilliant live stand-up from the shudderingly talented Dave Chappelle. Negative Man instructs us on the delicate art of 'talking the freak talk'. Our new finance segment helps put your mind at ease. Newsdesk goes undercover plus melodic assistance from the 'Red Hot Chili Peppers' &amp; 'Catatonia' ensure this episode is nicely rounded off... Well, hook in then!</description>
