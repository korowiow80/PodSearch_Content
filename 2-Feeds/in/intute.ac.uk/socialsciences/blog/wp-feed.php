			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Sunday, Intute officially closed.</p>
<p>We didn’t want to let this week pass by without saying a few final thanks to everyone that has been involved with the service throughout its 15 year history.</p>
<p><strong>So thanks.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to all of the staff that created Intute, to all of the cataloguers that added content to the site, and to the 1000s of people that suggested sites to us over the years.  Thanks to all of our partner institutions, and to the many organisations that worked with us on projects.  And of course, the biggest thanks go to our users, who have sent countless messages of support and encouragement over this last year.</p>
<p><strong>And what now?</strong></p>
<p>Intute content has found various new homes across the UK and overseas, from <a href="http://www.ipl.org/">ipl2</a> to the <a href="http://ials.sas.ac.uk/eaglei/project/eiproject.htm">Institute of Advanced Legal Studies</a>, (in line with our <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/uk/">Creative Commons</a> licence).</p>
<p>And we won’t be taking Intute offline just yet.  The website won’t be maintained or updated, but it will stay where it is for the next three years until July 2014.  For Informs and Virtual Training Suite users, you can find out the latest news by visiting their websites.</p>
<p>Thanks and goodbye from everyone at Intute.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>JISC funding for <a href="http://www.informs.intute.ac.uk/">Informs </a>and the <a href="http://www.vtstutorials.ac.uk/">Virtual Training Suite</a> will come to an end at the end of July 2011.</p>
<p>As part of the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/news/stories/2009/12/intute.aspx">removal of central funding for Intute</a> in July 2010, we conducted a full review and market research to help us investigate the possibility of introducing a subscription model for the Virtual Training Suite and Informs and to decide on options for moving forward.  We regret to inform our users and contributors that no realistic alternative funding model for either service has been identified.</p>
<p>Our investigations told us that institutions would be willing to pay for Informs and the Virtual Training Suite in principle, but given the current economic climate and the reduction in library budgets, these services are unlikely to be regarded as a priority.  As a result the number of subscribers would not provide enough income to continue in their current form.  Therefore, in consultation with the Informs Advisory Group and JISC, the following ways forward have been agreed.</p>
<ul>
<li>We will investigate releasing <strong>Informs</strong> as <strong>open source software</strong> so that it can be installed and run locally in your own institutions.  This work is in its early stages, but we will provide more information throughout the next few months, and full documentation will be made available to make the transition as easy as possible.</li>
<li>We will keep <strong>Informs</strong> running at Mimas until <strong>December 2011 </strong>to allow users to move to the open source version or find other alternatives.  Until this time all tutorials will work as normal, and helpdesk support will be available.</li>
<li><strong>The Virtual Training Suite</strong> site will be available until<strong> July 2012</strong>, but the tutorials will not be updated beyond July 2011.</li>
<li>All <strong>Virtual Training Suite tutorials</strong> will be individually available to download and reuse from <strong>August 2011.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to thank all Informs and Virtual Training Suite users and contributors for their support during this difficult year.  We would particularly like to thank those of you that took the time to speak to us, offer feedback and complete our survey.</p>
<p>For more information, please see the FAQs on the <a href="http://www.informs.intute.ac.uk/faqs.html">Informs </a>and <a href="http://www.vts.intute.ac.uk/about/faqs.html">Virtual Training Suite</a> websites, and please contact us if you have any concerns.  </p>
<p>We have also made the Market Research report and the Informs Technical Review reports available on our <a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk/announcements.html">website</a>. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, we wrote about our plans for <a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk/blog/2010/03/04/informs-funding-news/">Informs </a>and the <a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk/blog/2010/03/05/virtual-training-suite-funding-news/">Virtual Training Suite</a>.   Over the last few months we have been looking at options for developing a new membership business model to sustain the services after the funding is withdrawn in July 2011, and we are now conducting market research to find out what our users think.</p>
<p>Our market research consultants, <a href="http://www.mindsetresearch.co.uk/">Mindset Research</a>, have developed an online survey, available via the link above.</p>
<p>We need as many responses as possible to inform the research,  so if you have used Informs or the Virtual Training Suite or if you are interested in the future direction for these services, we would welcome your input.</p>
<p>The survey covers both Informs and the Virtual Training Suite. You  can choose to answer questions about one or both of these products.</p>
<p>The survey will be open until midnight on Wednesday 6th October 2010.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As, Intute enters its final maintenance year, I have spent a long time reflecting on the events that led us here.  With public sector organisations and higher education facing the possibility of further cuts, I think that it is timely to share some of those reflections in the context of demonstrating value for money and the search for new business models.</p>
<p>During my career, I have seen continuous technological, social and educational change and my information professional colleagues have re-invented themselves and their services.  We have worked to (amongst other things): reconcile business management practices with service delivery within academic cultures; adopt student and researcher centric practices; deploy new kinds of technical search and retrieval tools; and embrace electronic collection development and content digitisation.  And we have delivered on this, and all against the backdrop of increasing search engine dominance.</p>
<p>When the government public sector funding cuts hit, many of us working in higher education information services became only too aware of the new challenges ahead.  We are being pushed to articulate our continuing relevance, to demonstrate value for money, and in some cases to go further and find alternative business models for previously publicly funded services.</p>
<p>So what did this mean for Intute?</p>
<p><strong>Organisational effectiveness and efficiency</strong></p>
<p>In many ways Intute was a success.  At its height across the academic year for 2008/9, 34.5 million keyword searches alone were carried out.  As an organization we evolved into a strong distributed network of expertise, undertaking a number of innovative projects as well as delivering on our core service.  Sound familiar?  We invested in team development, set time aside for facilitated strategy setting, had healthy and constructive disagreements, and got more savvy about using our meeting time.  With input from <a href="http://deborahdalley.com/">Deborah Dalley and Associates</a> and <a href="http://www.lucidusconsulting.com/">Lucidus Consulting</a>, we managed complex strands of work across seven institutional offices using the Office of Government Commerce’s (OGC) <a href="http://www.msp-officialsite.com/home/Home.asp">Managing Successful Programmes (MSP)</a>, and became more efficient to the tune of 15% per year whilst continuing to innovate.</p>
<p><strong>Funding cuts and new business models</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, these efficiencies could not protect us against funding cuts, and we lost funding from the <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk">ESRC </a>and the <a href="http://www.ahrc.ac.uk">AHRC</a> before the withdrawal of support from <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">JISC</a>.  I knew that Intute would need to find alternative sources of money if it were going to survive, and that would mean exploring alternative business models.  However, this was a completely new way of thinking for us, and we struggled to translate our research into practice.  Two attempts to recruit a business development officer failed, and so we decided to bring in an independent consultancy to help us.  They proposed that diminishing library budgets would make introducing a subscription for Intute as it stood unrealistic, and the UK’s economic instability would scupper investigations into advertising and sponsorship.  Frustratingly, they concluded that grant funding was the most appropriate fit for a service such as ours.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Value for money</strong></p>
<p>To be successful in attracting new and continued grant funding we needed to innovate and provide demonstrable value for money.  Not a dilemma but difficult to quantify.  Our unique selling point of human selection and evaluation of Web sites was expensive, and perhaps unfashionable in an environment dominated by social media and free contribution.  The cost of human selection of websites suitable for use in academia, and the associated creation of metadata to enable search and retrieval, is no longer considered to be value for money.  Yet how can we quantify value for money.  A consultancy undertaken by Lucidus Consulting regarding value for money gave us food for thought.  This is what they said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Value for money is normally considered in relation to the “thing” or “good” provided. In the case of Intute, this is virtually impossible to verify since the service – beyond accuracy, integrity, completeness and timeliness – can only be qualified in subjective and perceptual terms. The term “value for money” is a difficult notion for the service provided by Intute … There can be no black-and-white answers to the value for money question in relation to its true purpose – education and learning.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>The perfect storm</strong></p>
<p>Like a perfect storm, the forces of search engine dominance, a lack of alternative business models, limited business development expertise, and the costs of associated with manual creation of metadata (compounded by lack of an automated alternative), collided to drown Intute as we know it.</p>
<p>For me, the question that presents more wider cause for concern is “Is Intute&#8217;s demise an omen of a wider trend for library and information services funding?”  Is it that the market can no longer value the services we provide in comparison to other things?  I’d like to leave you with a presentation by Dan Greenstien, who gave the opening keynote at the <a href="http://www.surviveorthrive.org.uk/">Survive or Thrive</a> conference in June.  He encouraged university librarians to think about “what kind of investments institutions will and will not make in their libraries when funding is scarce.”  I think this is a question that we will all be forced to answer.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I remember the 1st October 2004 vividly &#8211; it was the day I started work for Intute as the new Executive Director.  On that first day, I was ushered into my office, presented with a shiny new laptop, introduced to the Mimas Manchester based staff, and bombarded with information.   As the day ended I was totally bemused.</p>
<p>Soon after that I started my first of many tours of the UK, visiting the teams of staff at all the seven Intute partner institution universities.  I met a group of talented and dedicated people and I heard different but equally compelling views of the right way forward, which planted the seeds of a pathway for change in my head.  I believed we could do more, I believed in people’s capacity to innovate and I was convinced of the dedication of everyone to making the Internet a better place for students, researchers and academics.</p>
<p>From then until now, those people have confirmed that my first impressions were right.  They have worked tirelessly, they’ve adapted, they’ve pulled together, and they’ve turned good ideas into great projects and new services.  For all of this I would like to say a heartfelt thank you to all of them.</p>
<p>As we wind down our consortium, it makes me terribly sad to think that we will no longer all be working together after today.  I hope that our respective expertise, our ability to adapt, and our focus on user needs will lead us all on to make continued but different contributions to supporting intelligent use of the Internet.</p>

I&#8217;ve very much enjoyed the twelve years I&#8217;ve spent doing this job both with Intute Engineering and with EEVL before that, and I&#8217;d like to thank you all for your interest over the years and for reading this blog.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the fourth of our series of posts looking back at the work of Intute we wanted to focus on some of the valuable collaborative work that has taken place between the service and the wider education community, dating back well over a decade.</p>
<p>In addition to the seven universities that formed the Intute consortium, our most immediate partnerships were with over one hundred <a href="../../partners.html">organisations and individuals</a> who have worked on the Internet Resource Catalogue and those who are <a href="http://www.vts.intute.ac.uk/about/authors.html">authors </a>of the Virtual Training Suite tutorials.  These people have provided an invaluable pool of subject knowledge and expertise for the service, which the HE/FE community in general have been able to benefit from, and build upon.</p>
<p>In terms of wider partnerships we have also been privileged to work with a number of prestigious bodies such as the Wellcome Trust, the British Library, the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal Society of Chemistry and many of the Higher Education Academy Subject Centres through the <a href="../../projects.html">AIRDIP Project</a> and other initiatives.</p>
<p>Over the years, Intute has been involved with a range of projects, harnessing Intute staff expertise and technology, as well as using our database as a test-bed for new services and methods.  Some of the more technically oriented projects were described in the <a href="http://www.intute.ac.uk/blog/2010/07/16/virtual-worlds-and-the-facebook-generation-intutes-technical-legacy/">previous post</a> of this series.  Other projects that called on subject and content expertise included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://portal.organic-edunet.eu/">Organic.Edunet</a> for agriculture (an EU-wide programme)</li>
<li>Providing metadata services for <a href="http://www.jorum.ac.uk/">JORUM</a> and some of the Higher Education Academy Subject Centres.</li>
<li><a href="../../hottopics/tag/ijddip/">IJDDIP </a>(Intute/JISC Digitisation Dissemination Project, which aimed to generate awareness of the new JISC digitisation projects amongst the relevant sections of the UK academic research community.</li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout its history, Intute partners have worked together to offer real benefits to the library and information community.  We have developed machine-to-machine interfaces and worked closely with institutions to embed services and features into learning and teaching materials via the Intute <a href="../../integration/">Integration Project</a>.  University libraries such as Leeds used the MyIntute personalisation interface, newsfeeds and search widgets to build online lists of resources across a range of academic subjects.  By 2009, 67% of UK universities had widely integrated Intute content into their library Web pages, VLEs or federated search systems.</p>
<p>There are too many projects and partnerships to list here individually, but our recent user survey provided us with some feedback about the impact of the loss of Intute staff on innovation and development projects.  Here are some of the responses we received:</p>
<p><em>“Intute staff have been a valuable source of technical, quality and content expertise that would otherwise have cost huge amounts in consultancy fees.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>“Our involvement in such projects has to be assessed and justified against ever increasing pressure to maintain core activities. We value the knowledge, expertise and experience that Intute staff offer, which we can&#8217;t hope to replicate in house.”</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Intute staff are incredibly important to sustaining and improving collaboration and increasing momentum with small institutions or single research specialists and gathering it together into a sustainable whole.”</em></p>
<p>The number of partnerships and content specialists working across the service has provided some interesting challenges in terms of communications and implementing change in such as large service but it was also a good example of a service “by the community, for the community”.  We would like to thank all our partner organisations and especially the individuals within these organisations (past and present) for all of their support and hard work and wish them well in their future endeavours.</p>
