      <itunes:subtitle>A group of residents in Adelaide have opened a new front against the fast food giant. They&amp;#8217;re trying to stop a McDonald&amp;#8217;s restaurant opening opposite a school, arguing it will raise childhood obesity rates in the area. This may be the first time an urban planning court in Australia has looked beyond traffic, noise, litter and crime concerns, to consider the food environment. Reporter: Stan Correy.</itunes:subtitle>
