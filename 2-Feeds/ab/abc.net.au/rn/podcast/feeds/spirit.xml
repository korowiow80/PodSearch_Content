      <title>Archaeology and the media</title>
      <itunes:subtitle>Jesus&amp;apos; family tomb is one of the more sensational &amp;apos;discoveries&amp;apos; of recent years, but is it true?  Media interest in ancient discoveries is forcing the slow and painstaking discipline of archaeology into a swift and swashbuckling sport according to Egyptologist Dr Karin Sowada. In contrast, 25 years of digging and reconstructing a site at the Dead Sea in Jordan, under the direction of Konstantinos Politis, has yielded one of the most striking ancient churches, the Sanctuary of Lot&amp;apos;s Cave.</itunes:subtitle>

      <description>At the age of 76, the Dalai Lama isn&apos;t beating around the bush. In an exclusive interview with Rachael Kohn, he talks about the need for religious leaders to get off their high horse and meet the people, the importance of democracy, and the possibilities for a female Dalai Lama. We also hear his strong advice to 500 high school students, at the Chenrezig Institute for Buddhist Studies, in Eudlo, southern Queensland.</description>

      <itunes:subtitle>The Bible is rife with sex, and right from the beginning it is introduced as part of the human condition.</itunes:subtitle>
      <description>The Bible is rife with sex, and right from the beginning it is introduced as part of the human condition. Judges, kings and prophets enjoy sex, women use it to bring down tyrants, and King Solomon&apos;s &apos;Song of Songs&apos; makes Casanova&apos;s memoirs look like kid&apos;s stuff. Michael Coogan is one of the leading Biblical scholars in the US, and in his book God and Sex: What the Bible Really Says, he reveals all, including whether David loved Jonathan in that way.</description>

      <title>Female Messiah</title>
      <itunes:subtitle>The story of the Panacea Society.</itunes:subtitle>
      <description>The story of the Panacea Society. In the 1920s a vicar&apos;s widow in Bedford, England began a healing ministry that reached people around the world, including Australia. She was soon declared the Daughter of God, the Female Messiah, and took the name, Octavia. This fascinating story of religious and social change (and some tragic family history) was researched by the Right Rev&apos;d Jane Shaw, the Dean of Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. She spoke to Rachael Kohn on a recent visit to Australia.</description>

      <description>Robyn Williams of Radio National&apos;s The Science Show shares his unmitigated disappointment in the God which totally failed his expectations. Rabbi Jeffrey Kamins, from Emanuel Synagogue, argues that the expectations are misplaced, and blame should squarely be placed on humanity not God. God in the 21st Century was an event organised by the Sydney Institute, and our edited recording includes audience questions and comments from the other panel members, Dr Shakira Hussein and Angela Shanahan.</description>
