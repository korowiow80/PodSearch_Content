      <title>N.M.F. pt 4  (THE ARTIC)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1915/600x600_619470.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TRACK 1:STOP FRONTIN
TRACK 2:THE RECIPE
______________________________________________________________
Artist: Articulate
Hometown: Baltimore, MD
Tracks included: &quot;The Recipe&quot; are &quot;Stop Frontin'&quot; from Articulate's The Torch Has Been Passed EP, now available on www.ItsArtic.com

Bio:

Articulate is a rapper/producer from Baltimore, MD, who is often described as a rapper's rapper. With each verse, he displays a level of lyricism that is immediately respected by those who have been living and breathing Hip-Hop since its inception--a rarity for a young artist. His songs cover a wide range of topics. Whether dealing with the unexpected death of his father, giving his take on things going on in the world, or just reflecting on life, Artic's music touches people of all ages, races, and backgrounds. The realness of his songs give them a universal appeal that guarantees his success in the music business.

The newest project from Articulate, the &quot;The Torch Has Been Passed EP&quot; is a definitive example of where Hip-Hop can go in 2006 and beyond. From smooth concept tracks like &quot;The Recipe&quot; to crazy lyrical displays like &quot;Clever&quot;, there is something on this CD for everybody to feel. Even with this diversity, the songs still fit together and flow with each other in a way that you have to hear to believe. 

A torch was lit when hip-hop greats such as Rakim, Nas, 2pac, and Wu-Tang stepped on the scene with albums that defined the sound of the culture we live daily. In 2006 that fiery torch was passed to Articulate.
