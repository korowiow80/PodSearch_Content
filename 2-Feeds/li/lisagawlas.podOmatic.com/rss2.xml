      <title>The Ego is the Fuel that Creates Your Reailty - What Fuel are You Using?</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1048659/600x600_1392002.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the ego&amp;rsquo;s original design, it created that sense of fear, or &amp;ldquo;fight or flight&amp;rdquo; feeling within us ONLY to protect us. Us being the incarnate spiritual Being. It is also designed perfectly to know matter. To know how to work with the energies we call matter. In it&amp;rsquo;s original state, when the heart (which is your soul) has a prompting, it is the ego that know how to make it manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also look at it like this, the heart is the magnetic field of attraction, the mind/ego is the fuel that charges up and runs your magnetic field. In order to run in high efficiency, you much use the correct fuel. The new or original ego is high test, the old ego is diesel. Now remember you are the alchemist of your life. Only you can change the fuel that drives your life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is Shambhala and where is it really?</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1048659/600x600_3978526.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shambhala is the very energy of God realization.  The very field of existence where heaven and earth are one.  Shambhala is the highest field of energy available to all humans who has done their inner work and raised their vibration to the point of accessing it and living within it.  



This sacred energy is so special, so incredibly potent in its expression that it literally takes two people to unlock the energy and bring it here to earth.  This energy is the true God potential in all of us.  The very energy that effortlessly turned loaves into fish, water into wine and created instant healing with a simple touch of the hand.

And WE must bring it back into the field of matter!  This podcasts tell you how we can do this!!</description>

We can all sit back and say, &#8220;Ohhh this needs to change, that needs to change&#8221; and then wait for someone to actually do it. At this moment in time, that is how the majority of people are, not because they are lazy (although some are) but because they are not sure what to do, and how to go about doing it.

What if there was a way.... would you BE THE CHANGE THAT IS NEEDED??

Now, we stay in body and move thru the Ascention or Enlightenment process.  There are 8 inner shifts to help you understand where you are in your own ascention process, all talked about in this podcast.  Be forewarned, this is a long podcast (smile).</description>

      <title>Energy, Vibration, Earth and You!</title>
      <description>Earth has changed her vibration, and will continue to change thru 2012, as she changes, so is everyone and everything on this planet.  This energy is magnificent, but can be viewed as less than that because it makes you change... there is no choice really... as the earth shifst so must you, fight it and you will find yourself on the other side of the veil, go with it, and life transforms into the most incredible adventure ever!!  Either way is perfectly wonderful, there is no judgement on how you experience this energetically brand new planet called earth!  </description>

      <itunes:summary>Earth has changed her vibration, and will continue to change thru 2012, as she changes, so is everyone and everything on this planet.  This energy is magnificent, but can be viewed as less than that because it makes you change... there is no choice really... as the earth shifst so must you, fight it and you will find yourself on the other side of the veil, go with it, and life transforms into the most incredible adventure ever!!  Either way is perfectly wonderful, there is no judgement on how you experience this energetically brand new planet called earth!  </itunes:summary>

      <title>The Kundalini of Life</title>
      <description>If you are not already familiar with what Kundalini is, please visit my website at www.spiritualhealing-godsway.org/kundalini.html

The shifting of energies we felt in June 2007 was actually the physical releasing of Earths Kundalini energy rising upwards thru the veil.  We are ALL affected by this energy.  How depends on where you focus.. fear or love.  Now is the time to get ready for the b&quot;big one&quot; Gods Kundalini being released!</description>

      <description>This is the story of how I came into this spiritual path and whence I came from.  It also details how important, how incredible meditation really is and what is possible thru it.  It is a long session, which I try to keep these podcast sessions short and to the point, but I felt the details of it all were too important to skip over.  May you be inspired!</description>

      <title>Opening to the Spiritual Realm Hypnosis CD</title>
      <description>Learning to relax the mind and body and be open to the spiritual information that is available to everyone one of us is as easy as listening to this CD.  

Be sure you are wearing comfortable clothing, no shoes, and have the volume just above audable, be sure your head and neck are supported, then just relax as you drift upwards to the realm of spirit.

Enjoy the journey!</description>

      <title>The Wonder of You</title>
      <description>There is power in our sexual energy that most people take for granted because they do not understand the &#8220;whole&#8221; of it all.  The places the orgasm can take is awe-amazing!



What if&#8230; Our sexual energy, when shared with pure love in the heart with another was our closest connection to our Creator? 

What if&#8230; The energetic exchange merged these three energies as one (you, partner, &amp; Creator)?

What if&#8230; The creation of the soul was done through the orgasmic flow of our Creator, in a pure and loving state so that when we shared ourselves in this manner, in the physical world of Being, could we not touch and feel the heart of God within the exchange?



Your Sensual, Sexual, Orgasmic energy is your place of power - Spiritual Power

      <title>What is Conscious Living?</title>
      <description>Living consciously is more than realizing you are a body and in the physical place we call life.  Every thought, word and deed has a far reaching effect&#8230;. even on people you do not know! 

Every thought, word and deed you put &#8220;out there&#8221; comes back to you!  What reality have you created for yourself and how is it affecting others?

      <title>Beliefs Create Your Reality</title>
      <description>There is a powerful energy creating the reality you know as your life&#8230; that energy is YOU!  The engine that creates your life thru you is your belief system!  Is there something about yourself or your life you want changed&#8230; then start with what you believe about that area.  Better yet&#8230; stay away from any beliefs!  are simply what someone else told you is true&#8230; not that it is true&#8230; Truth is very different than a belief!

      <title>Life Really Isn't In Gods Hands.... It's in YOURS!</title>
      <description>Many of us have said prayers that seem to go unanswered&#8230; unfullfilled&#8230;. but why?  Maybe it is because YOU did nothing to create the energy of the prayer/desire in YOUR life. 

YOU ARE THE GOD YOU ARE PRAYING TO!

      <title>Illusion - Two realities happening at once!</title>
      <description>I  have always heard the statements: &#8221;what you perceive is what you receive&#8221;, &#8220;you only experience what you focus on&#8221; and so on, but until the other day, I did not realize just how true those statements are.  Reality is multilayered and shows itself according to what you focus on!  This is my experience and understanding of the days to come for all of us!

      <title>When Death Enters Yor Life</title>
      <description>Death does not happen just once in a lifetime&#8230; We have experienced death in many ways, many times in our lifetimes and will continue to do so until we leave this physical body.  A death of a relationship, the end of a job, the breaking of a vehicle, a house catching fire&#8230;. death comes in many ways and for only one reason, to make way for the new energy that is trying to enter.   Where we get hung up in life is trying to cling to the old, or stay in a state of mourning/depression, that is when the death cycle becomes hardest.  Letting go&#8230;. letting the universe take care of you thru your percieved losses&#8230;. that will bring the quickest and most joyous new life to you.  But how do you to that??  This is my story of my story..</description>
