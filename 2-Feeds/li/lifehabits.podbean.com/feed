			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re interested for health, the environment, ethics, or just to eat tasty food, this episode will help you with moving toward a plant-based diet and provide you with 10 practical progressive steps to get there. Karel has long-time vegetarian advocate Dilip Barman as his guest on this episode. Dilip makes reference to two websites during the session: the first is an article on <a title="FOA" href="http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/" target="_blank">FAO</a> and the second is an article on the <a title="Guardian" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/sep/07/food.foodanddrink" target="_blank">Guardian</a> website.  For more information, you can visit Dilip&#8217;s own <a title="Dilip" href="http://dilip.info" target="_blank">website</a>, his <a title="Cooking" href="http://dilipdinner.blogspot.com" target="_blank">cooking site</a>, his <a title="Photography" href="http://vibrant-memories.com" target="_blank">photography site</a>, and the <a title="IVU" href="http://ivu.org" target="_blank">International Vegetarian Union site</a>, and also the <a title="Triagle" href="http://trianglevegsociety.org" target="_blank">Triangle Vegetarian Society site</a>.  Please note that there is a knocking sound during parts of the podcast which we&#8217;ve done the best to try to edit out but still is able to be heard in certain places.  Apologies for any annoyance this may cause you while listening to this episode.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The mind is amazingly powerful.  We can either control it or be controlled by it.  This episode is all about being aware of what your mind is capable of doing when you don&#8217;t control it and, once you&#8217;re aware of it, to take control.  Karel quotes Marcus Aurelius, who said, &#8220;You have the power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength&#8221;.</p>
<p>Karel gives a few examples of the power of the mind and the ways in which it can take control without our knowledge.  He talks about the <a title="placebo effect" href="http://www.npr.org/dmg/dmg.php?prgCode=TOTN&amp;showDate=03-Aug-2007&amp;segNum=4&amp;mediaPref=WM" target="_blank">placebo effect</a> in medical research, the Loftus&#8217;s research into <a title="reconstructed memories" href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolab/episodes/2007/06/08/segments/71873" target="_blank">reconstructed memories</a>, Dawkins&#8217;s work on the difficulty of <a title="changing religious beliefs" href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail478.html" target="_blank">changing religious beliefs</a>, and Gladwell&#8217;s summary of work on the <a title="confirmation bias in auditions" href="http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail478.html" target="_blank">confirmation bias in auditions</a> (click on the links in the previous paragraph to listen to audio segments giving details on each of these). Karel then gives examples of several other biases including the bandwagon effect, base rate fallacy, the illusion of control bias, gamblers fallacy, the planning fallacy, the halo effect, in-group bias, and out-group homogeneity bias, groupthink, and cognitive dissonance. Have a look at <a title="a longer list" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_biases" target="_blank">a longer list</a> of biases on Wikipedia.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important habits to learn is to stay positive no matter what the stimulus and now matter what the context.  Karel starts off this episode by quoting Helen Keller who said, &#8220;when one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has been opened for us&#8221;.  The episode includes a story about a university coach who was overly negative but whose behavior changed dramatically when confronted to an unwavering positive reaction.  We have the power to decide how to react to a stimulus and if we decide to take the negative reaction it often yields less than optimal results; when we react positively, the outcomes are often much more favorable.  Karel gives examples of positive approaches in situations regarding work and career, relationships, parenting, and health.  In each, a specific positive approach can yield incredibly desirable outcomes.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Karel Vredenburg focuses on time management in this episode. You might be thinking, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have time for that!&#8221; but after listening and taking the advice given you will have a lot more time to devote to the important items in your life.  Karel starts off by quoting Thomas Edison who said, &#8220;Time is really the only capital that any human being has, and the only thing he can&#8217;t afford to lose.&#8221; to reinforce the importance of valuing time and thus managing it effectively.</p>
<p>Karel discusses taking control of your time, yearly and weekly time scales, prioritizing the roles you play, and then has specific advice on new habits to consider for use on the job including default meeting length, staying focussed during meetings, deciding whether a meeting, a phone call, an e-mail, or an IM chat is most appropriate and efficient.  His advice for the rest of your life includes multitasking with an iPod, using audible.com to get your reading material, listening to podcasts, switching phone to voicemail and text messaging, subcontracting work at home, assigning tasks to kids and making their allowance contingent on the work, scheduling time for each family member, and also to watch out for overscheduling activities at home and leaving some time for spontaneous activities.
