			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I realized a few months ago that I&#8217;ve churned out a good number of genre-related psychedelic/horror science fiction, so I ran with it, wrote a couple more, and now I&#8217;m at a point where I can publish these as a short collection. Please consider pledging to help raise funds for the publication, I plan on doing a &#8220;special&#8221; publishing job with this, not your run-of-the-mill paperback. Already I have some great artists who have stepped in to help!</p>

(Brief Announcement: Lit-Cast may be airing fewer stories in the coming months as I, Jason Rizos, have taken on a large project unrelated, sadly, to literature. I'm happy that so many of you are listening to our programs and I welcome your feedback! Feel free to send me an email with any questions or concerns, or post a comment on a story! -jmr) </itunes:summary>
