But we do mix it in with government somehow, as we always do, when we discuss irrational fears.&amp;nbsp; They apply both to roller coasters and to state-created boogeymen.</itunes:summary>

      <itunes:summary>Guest: Jan Narveson, Waterloo University
Tucson has struck down a proposal for a sales tax on food; good for them.
We play a clip from a Ron Paul announcement discussing the Census, and provide our own two cents.
Finally, we had interviewed Jan Narveson, former professor at the University of Waterloo in Canada, back in January at the ISIL conference.&amp;nbsp; We played that interview and discussed the points that Profession Narveson brought up.</itunes:summary>

Next, we jumped into the FCC's Equal Time and (now defunct) Fairness Doctrine provisions.
Finally, we covered the credit card legislation that passed a few months ago and discussed the implications of the (well-intended?) changes.</itunes:summary>

Joining us on the program this week was John Cole from Unimodal to discuss their revolutionary mass transportation product SkyTran.&amp;nbsp; SkyTran is faster than individual vehicles, can transport more people than busses, subways and light rail, is super energy efficient, is far cheaper to build than traditional roads, and is safe.&amp;nbsp; So why isn't it being installed everywhere as we speak?
Lynn Weaver joined us to discuss Prop 13 Arizona, the initiative pending for this year's ballot in Arizona in order to control property tax costs.&amp;nbsp; Think your property devaluation is going to cause you property taxes to decrease?&amp;nbsp; Think again, Arizonans!</itunes:summary>

The Prestons prevailed over the City of Tempe, again.&amp;nbsp; But it appears the city will continue wasting taxpayer funds and infringing on the rights of these small business owners.
Steve Bierfeldt, Campaign For Liberty, was stopped by TSA a few months back because he was carrying large quantities of cash.&amp;nbsp; TSA detained and mishandled him for quite some time.&amp;nbsp; He joins us on today's show to discuss his experience.

In current events, it looks as though California is shutting down some of their state parks because of their budget shortages, and the parks may be turned over to the federal printing presses.
Only 3.5% of government (public) high school students were able to pass the U.S. Citizenship test.
The City of Tempe (headed by Mayor Hugh Hallman, who ridiculously tries to attach the &amp;quot;libertarian&amp;quot; label to his name) is attempting to shut down a tatoo parlor by revoking permits that it previously issues on the grounds that it's going to attract gangs and heroine addicts.&amp;nbsp; The courts already ruled against the city, and they are now asking for a do-over.</itunes:summary>

Joe Cobb from the Arizona LP joined the program to update us on the state's voter registration drive.&amp;nbsp; It appears that the state and most counties are so far in the clear in terms of maintaining the required number of voters for ballot status.&amp;nbsp; Given that Mr. Cobb is a professional economist and former aid to Ron Paul, we decided to take advantage of his presence and probe him a bit on monetary policy.

      <itunes:summary>Guest: Dr. Walter Block
There are roughly 46,000 deaths per year on our nation's government-maintained and managed roads, but government never receives blame for this and so therefore has no real incentive to do anything about it.&amp;nbsp; Would a private road system put those who manage the roads in a position to make them safer and more efficient?
We discussed this issue with Dr. Walter Block on today's program, an Austrian school economist and libertarian/anarcho-capitalist philosopher, a Professor of Economics at Loyola University New Orleans, a Senior Fellow with the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and a supporter of privatizing the nation's roads.</itunes:summary>

We were honored to have Dr. Mary Ruwart, author and Libertarian Presidential candidate, as our guest on the program.&amp;nbsp; Our discussion focused mainly on the ideas of charity; whether or not government should have a monopoly on charity, have mixed involvement, or no involvement at all.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Ruwart also explained the detriments to government involvement in charity, and how getting their hands into the mix actually worsens the problem.</itunes:summary>

Napolitano becoming the Secretary of Homeland Security in Obama's administration.</itunes:summary>
