			<title>Lesbianism - Over Sexed? </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/lesbianism-over-sexed-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">Carrie kisses Nina's neck. Nina is in ecstasy with sexual feelings in her heart. The kisses melt her sorrows and pain away. Carrie whispers in Nina&rsquo;s ear as if she is a loving angel. Nina grins and grabs Carrie's thin body with sex in her eyes. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Nina explores Carrie's body with her tongue, licking and caressing her body like a delicious dish. Carrie's breasts are like beautiful mountains in a great valley and her stomach is The Plains. The two bodies intersect each other in a beautiful sensual musical. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Nina slowly kisses Carrie&rsquo;s body with passion and freeness. She sucks her stomach and begins to suck her juices. Using her tongue, she sucks the wonderful&hellip; WTF? </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> This is a scene I made up, but in lesbian movies and television shows, it's the same thing with different women. There is always a sex scene with two femme women who look like supermodels and they are exploring each other the same way. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Lesbians are treated like sexual objects than real people with feelings. It bothers me when lesbians have to prove their sexuality. Saying you are a lesbian doesn't fly in the lesbian world; it's more of an action. For example, how many women did you have sex with or have you been in a sexual relationship with a woman? I hate the questions. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Lesbian means women who sexually love other women. Over the years, The World of Lesbo has changed the meaning several times over because of men. For some strange reason, men love to see two supermodel look like women kiss and make out, but seeing two men kissing is disgusting. What is so disgusting about two men kissing each other? </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I met a woman at church. She informed me that she is bisexual. Ok, so what? She believes its fine for two women to have sex, but a relationship is only between a man and woman. WTF? </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Yes, women are beautiful sensual creatures made by God himself with hint of extra beauty and smarts. Think about it, women can multi-tasks and men can't. Justin Timberlake proved that comment in an interview. Women are emotional but strong; even though men make women look weak. There is nothing weak about a woman. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Once a month, women have to deal with PMS, blood flow and cramps. Women have babies. Women can pop a baby out and go back to work. Women can deal with so much pressure and stress than a man. Oh by the way, women can't get sick for god sakes or the Earth will explode. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> For years, women have been over sexed in the media and we have accepted it. Why? I don't know. For some reason, real lesbians are typecast and fake lesbians are considered Stars in the spotlight. Why? I don't know. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I watched a lesbian movie called "Show Me". It was a great movie. It focused on the lesbian relationship and not the lesbian sex act. It was a thriller and the writing of the film was excellent. I will like to see more films which focus more on the relationship then soft porn for men and horny women.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Lesbianism is not a lifestyle, a life choice, something you saw in the media or something to do when you hate men. Lesbianism is what YOU are as a person. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I don't know why two women kissing turn men on, but lesbianism is love between two women, even if they don't look like supermodels. </span><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

			<title>Gender Profiling Hurts Our National Health Care</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/gender-profiling-hurts-our-national-health-care]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;"><b>By Linda Brodsky, M.D.</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> WeNews commentator</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Tuesday, August 25, 2009</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> This week, U.S. women celebrate our 89th anniversary of gaining the right to vote and Dr. Linda Brodsky uses the moment to review the lingering effects of women's inequities on the burning national debate over health care reform.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Editor's Note: The following is a commentary. The opinions expressed are those of the author and not necessarily the views of Women's eNews.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> (WOMENSENEWS)--On August 26, we celebrate Women's Equality Day, commemorating the 89th anniversary of the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution that gave women the vote in 1920.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Though officially organized in 1848 in Seneca Falls, N.Y., the U.S. women's rights movement endured 72 years before realizing this first critical goal.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Another 51 years passed before New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug in 1971 sponsored a bill so that each successive U.S. president would be able to proclaim August 26 as Women's Equality Day.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Now, 38 years later, where are we?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> As a group, U.S. women are among the most educated and privileged in the world. But our gender gap in national political representation remains wider than 26 other countries.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> That leaves us at a disadvantage in the most heated domestic policy debate of these days: healthcare reform.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> As we monitor and participate in this debate, women should push for changes in national health policy that rectify women's inequalities as medical professionals and patients.</span><br /><br /></p>
<center><span style="font-size: small;">Legal Discrimination</span></center>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Gender profiling for health insurance purposes continues to be legal in most states.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Women pay more for individual health insurance if we are even able to obtain coverage.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> A study by National Women's Law Center finds that a 30 year-old non-smoking women often pays significantly more than a 30 year-old male smoker.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Thus, many women, particularly those with lower incomes, go without health insurance and have less access to both preventative and necessary healthcare.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Many policies have no maternity benefits and many exclude those with previous C-sections or who have been victims of domestic violence.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> And after we recover from birthing our children (and our country's future) and return to work, we often are denied job advancement at best, or face demotion or dismissal at worst. Protections are inadequate and nearly impossible to enforce given the enormous financial and emotional costs of litigation.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> As we mature, women are more likely to be misdiagnosed and undertreated if we have heart disease.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> We are less likely to get joint replacements for orthopedic problems and will suffer from back pain longer before receiving relief.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> We are more often initially told "it's all in your head," suffering through mental health diagnoses where none exists.</span><br /><br /></p>
<center><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Emotional Integrity Questioned</b></span></center>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Mothers of my patients have arrived in my office desperate because their own emotional integrity has been questioned when their 9-month old child still wakes 10-15 times each night crying or their rambunctious pre-teen is out of their control. When obstructive sleep apnea or severe extra-esophageal reflux are diagnosed and treated, how rapidly these mothers recover from their so-called "over-concern!"</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Gender inequality for female physicians takes the form of fewer opportunities for advancement. This minimizes our impact in the arenas of research, particularly in women's health issues, public health policies and medical education of the future physicians.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Female physicians occupy only 17 percent of the positions on medical journal editorial boards, where the decisions about what research is worthy of publication are made.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Our numbers in medical academia--where we educate our future physicians and most research is performed-- are not representative.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Women are also in short supply in medical organizations that advise our elected leaders, such as the American Medical Association or the American College of Surgeons.</span><br /><br /></p>
<center><span style="font-size: small;"><b>61 Cents on the Dollar</b></span></center>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Female physicians earn only 61 cents for each dollar a male physician earns. We face a greater than 80 percent chance of experiencing discrimination and-or sexual harassment some time during our career. Higher rates of burnout are common. How can this physician work force be as effective as our rising needs require?</span><br /><br /></p>
<center><span style="font-size: small;"><b>Dangerous Misuse of Resources</b></span></center>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> This situation translates into a dangerous misuse of our most important medical resources.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Misuse and underuse of physician talent is more than unhealthy as world-wide physician shortages are anticipated. In the long run, failure to equally value women as healthcare providers will ultimately damage our nation's health and healthcare needs.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> It's time we took a bold approach to fixing gender equity as part of fixing our health care system. We can start this reform process by linking accreditation and federal and state health care dollars to metrics that include closure of the gender gap.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Finally we must not only recognize but also vigorously root out the pervasive negative effects of this gender gap in all aspects of our society. In healthcare, the stakes categorically mean the difference between life and death.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> We may have the vote, but 161 years later, hundreds of proclamations, quasi-awareness holidays, or even scores of legislative initiatives have been insufficient to change the status quo.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[By Linda Brodsky, M.D. WeNews commentator Tuesday, August 25, 2009 This week, U.S. women celebrate our 89th anniversary of gaining the right to vote and Dr. Linda Brodsky uses the moment to review the lingering effects of women's inequities on the burning national debate over health care reform. Editor's Note: The following is a commentary. The opinions expressed are those of the author and not necessarily the views of Women's eNews. (WOMENSENEWS)--On August 26, we celebrate Women's Equality Day, commemorating the 89th anniversary of the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution that gave women the vote in 1920. Though officially organized in 1848 in Seneca Falls, N.Y., the U.S. women's rights movement endured 72 years before realizing this first critical goal. Another 51 years passed before New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug in 1971 sponsored a bill so that each successive U.S. president would be able to proclaim August 26 as Women's Equality Day. Now, 38 years later, where are we? As a group, U.S. women are among the most educated and privileged in the world. But our gender gap in national political representation remains wider than 26 other countries. That leaves us at a disadvantage in the most heated domestic policy debate of these days: healthcare reform. As we monitor and participate in this debate, women should push for changes in national health policy that rectify women's inequalities as medical professionals and patients.
Legal Discrimination
 Gender profiling for health insurance purposes continues to be legal in most states. Women pay more for individual health insurance if we are even able to obtain coverage. A study by National Women's Law Center finds that a 30 year-old non-smoking women often pays significantly more than a 30 year-old male smoker. Thus, many women, particularly those with lower incomes, go without health insurance and have less access to both preventative and necessary healthcare. Many policies have no maternity benefits and many exclude those with previous C-sections or who have been victims of domestic violence. And after we recover from birthing our children (and our country's future) and return to work, we often are denied job advancement at best, or face demotion or dismissal at worst. Protections are inadequate and nearly impossible to enforce given the enormous financial and emotional costs of litigation. As we mature, women are more likely to be misdiagnosed and undertreated if we have heart disease. We are less likely to get joint replacements for orthopedic problems and will suffer from back pain longer before receiving relief. We are more often initially told "it's all in your head," suffering through mental health diagnoses where none exists.
Emotional Integrity Questioned
 Mothers of my patients have arrived in my office desperate because their own emotional integrity has been questioned when their 9-month old child still wakes 10-15 times each night crying or their rambunctious pre-teen is out of their control. When obstructive sleep apnea or severe extra-esophageal reflux are diagnosed and treated, how rapidly these mothers recover from their so-called "over-concern!" Gender inequality for female physicians takes the form of fewer opportunities for advancement. This minimizes our impact in the arenas of research, particularly in women's health issues, public health policies and medical education of the future physicians. Female physicians occupy only 17 percent of the positions on medical journal editorial boards, where the decisions about what research is worthy of publication are made. Our numbers in medical academia--where we educate our future physicians and most research is performed-- are not representative. Women are also in short supply in medical organizations that advise our elected leaders, such as the American Medical Association or the American College of Surgeons.
61 Cents on the Dollar
 Female physicians earn only 61 cents for each dollar a male physician earns. We face a greater than 80 percent chance of experiencing discrimination and-or sexual harassment some time during our career. Higher rates of burnout are common. How can this physician work force be as effective as our rising needs require?
Dangerous Misuse of Resources
 This situation translates into a dangerous misuse of our most important medical resources. Misuse and underuse of physician talent is more than unhealthy as world-wide physician shortages are anticipated. In the long run, failure to equally value women as healthcare providers will ultimately damage our nation's health and healthcare needs. It's time we took a bold approach to fixing gender equity as part of fixing our health care system. We can start this reform process by linking accreditation and federal and state health care dollars to metrics that include closure of the gender gap. Finally we must not only recognize but also vigorously root out the pervasive negative effects of this gender gap in all aspects of our society. In healthcare, the stakes categorically mean the difference between life and death. We may have the vote, but 161 years later, hundreds of proclamations, quasi-awareness holidays, or even scores of legislative initiatives have been insufficient to change the status quo. Gender stereotyping, gender discrimination, and other forms of violence against women, must be aggressively rooted out.

She is accepting submissions for her multi-author book project that will examine the effects of gender discrimination in healthcare.

<p></p>
<center><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Published July 17, 2011</strong></span></center>
<p><br /> <br /><span style="font-size: small;">Gay service members from Army soldiers to Air Force officers are planning to celebrate the official end of the military's 17-year policy that forced them to hide their sexual orientation with another official act -- marriage.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> A 27-year-old Air Force officer from Ohio said he can't wait to wed his partner of two years and slip on a ring that he won't have to take off or lie about when he goes to work each day once "don't ask, don't tell" is repealed. He plans to wed his boyfriend, a federal employee, in Washington D.C. where same-sex marriages are legal.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> He asked not to be identified, following the advice of the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a national organization representing gay troops, including the Air Force officer, that has cautioned those on active duty from coming out until the ban is off the books. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> "I owe it to him and myself," the officer said of getting married. "I don't want to do it in the dark. I think that taints what it's supposed to be about -- which is us, our families, and our government."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> But in the eyes of the military the marriage will not be recognized and the couple will still be denied most of the benefits the Defense Department gives to heterosexual couples to ease the costs of medical care, travel, housing and other living expenses.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The Pentagon says the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act -- which defines marriage for federal program purposes as a legal union between a man and woman -- prohibits the Defense Department from extending those benefits to gay couples, even if they are married legally in certain states. That means housing allowances and off-base living space for gay service members with partners could be decided as if they were living alone. Base transfers would not take into account their spouses. If two gay service members are married to each other they may be transferred to two different states or regions of the world. For heterosexual couples, the military tries to avoid that from happening. Gay activists and even some commanders say the discrepancy will create a two-tier system in an institution built on uniformity.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> "It's not going to work," said Army Reserve Capt. R. Clarke Cooper, who heads up the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group that sued the Justice Department to stop the enforcement of the "don't ask, don't tell" policy. "Taking care of our soldiers is necessary to ensure morale and unit cohesion. This creates a glaring stratification in the disbursement of support services and benefits."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Cooper said he also plans to marry his boyfriend, a former Navy officer, in a post-repeal era. The Obama administration has said it believes the ban could be fully lifted within weeks. A federal appeals court ruling July 6 ordered the government to immediately cease its enforcement. After the Department of Justice filed an emergency motion asking the court to reconsider its order, the court on Friday reinstated the law but with a caveat that prevents the government from investigating or penalizing anyone who is openly gay.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The Justice Department in its motion argued ending the ban abruptly now would pre-empt the "orderly process" for rolling back the policy as outlined in the law passed and signed by the president in December.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The military's staunchly traditional, tight-knit society, meanwhile, has been quickly adapting to the social revolution: Many gay officers say they have already come out to their commanders and fellow troops, and now discuss their weekend plans without a worry.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The Air Force officer says he has dropped the code words "Red Solo Cups" -- the red plastic cups used at parties -- that he slipped into conversations for years to tell his partner he loved him when troops were within earshot. He now feels comfortable saying "I love you" on the phone, no longer fearful he will be interrogated by peers.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> One male soldier, who also asked not to be identified, said after Congress approved repealing the law, he listed his boyfriend on his Army forms as his emergency contact and primary beneficiary of his military life insurance in case he dies in Afghanistan.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> He said when he was transferred to South Korea, he and his partner had to pay for his partner's move.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> "But we were able to stay together," the soldier wrote in an e-mail to The Associated Press from Afghanistan. "During the move, I realized I needed to make sure my partner in life was taken care of if something, the worst, ever happened to me, especially knowing I was about to deploy." The soldier said when he added his boyfriend's name to the paperwork as a primary beneficiary and identified him as a friend, the non-commissioned officer in charge shut his office door and told him: "Unlike the inherent benefits to being married in the Army, such as housing and sustenance allowances, our life insurance and will don't discriminate."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Same-sex partners can be listed as the person to be notified in case a service member is killed, injured, or missing, but current regulations prevent anyone other than immediate family -- not same-sex spouses -- from learning the details of the death. Same-sex spouses also will not be eligible for travel allowances to attend repatriation ceremonies if their military spouses are killed in action.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Gay spouses also will be denied military ID cards. That means they will not be allowed on bases unless they are accompanied by a service member and they cannot shop at commissaries or exchanges that have reduced prices for groceries and clothing, nor can they be treated at military medical facilities. They also will be excluded from base programs providing recreation and other such kinds of support.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Military officials say some hardship cases may be handled on an individual basis.

            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/sudden-inspection-at-gay-bar-mars-victory-celebration-for-some]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Sudden Inspection at Gay Bar Mars Victory Celebration for Some</span></strong><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> By AL BAKER and MICK MEENAN</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> An unannounced inspection that several agencies carried out at a gay bar in Manhattan on Friday night occurred at nearly the same time that patrons were celebrating the passage of legislation in Albany legalizing same-sex marriage.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Police officials said on Saturday that the inspection was part of a routine operation planned long ago. But Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, said that he was troubled by descriptions of what took place at the Eagle bar, on West 28th Street off 11th Avenue, and that the actions amounted to a raid.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;I am going to ask the police commissioner to conduct a formal investigation concerning the circumstances around this raid,&rdquo; he added.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The inspection occurred late at night, Mr. Stringer said, and while it was &ldquo;true that there are these multiagency inspections, I think this one was ill-conceived and ill-timed given the circumstances surrounding the marriage equality celebration, on Pride week.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> According to those present, about 100 people were mingling at the Eagle, when representatives from the New York Police Department and three other city agencies, as well as from the State Liquor Authority, showed up, at nearly the same time as a vote by the State Senate to legalize same-sex marriage and as the thrill of victory was swirling through the place.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;I was on the roof deck, smoking a cigar and having drinks with friends, and all of a sudden, the police showed up and started shining flashlights in everyone&rsquo;s face and offending everyone,&rdquo; said Thomas J. Shevlin, a financial markets researcher and the treasurer of the Stonewall Democratic Club.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;Basically, it is offensive,&rdquo; Mr. Shevlin, 40, said. &ldquo;It is real serious harassment that they come out on pride weekend.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Paul J. Browne, the Police Department&rsquo;s chief spokesman, said the Eagle was one of four establishments in the 10th Precinct inspected on Friday under a program known as MARCH, or multiagency response to community hot spots.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> He said every precinct in the city, except for Central Park, carried out such operations at what amounted to &ldquo;a couple thousand clubs&rdquo; each year.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The establishments are selected because they are the subjects of &ldquo;chronic complaints&rdquo; from community members that are mostly reported through the city&rsquo;s 311 and 911 communications systems over concerns like excessive noise or fighting, Mr. Browne said. The inspections, he added, were planned weeks in advance.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> He said the inspection at the Eagle led to six violations being issued: two from the police regarding unlicensed security; one from the Department of Environmental Protection regarding unnecessary noise; one from the Buildings Department for having no public assembly permit; and two from the liquor authority for &ldquo;extension of premise,&rdquo; and &ldquo;failure to conform to application.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Robert Berk, 50, the owner of the Eagle, said on Saturday that the operation&rsquo;s timing was &ldquo;bad.&rdquo; The officers and other agents began entering, unannounced, about 10:30 p.m., he said, and eventually numbered about 20. They were &ldquo;aggressive, but polite&rdquo; as they examined the premises, he said, adding that they went over paperwork and inspected items like the ice makers and the licenses of security guards.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Mr. Berk, who is gay, and who described his bar as a &ldquo;Levis and leather&rdquo; establishment, added he expected to receive a list of violations in the mail.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;I definitely lost money last night because they made patrons wait outside in a line down the block,&rdquo; Mr. Berk said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much I have to pay, but it&rsquo;s enough to matter.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Christopher J. Borras, 46, was among those waiting to get in, finally gaining entry about 11:45 p.m., just as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was preparing to sign the marriage measure into law.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;I find interesting the timing,&rdquo; said Mr. Borras, who had been at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village earlier that night. &ldquo;I would just like to know from the police: `Why did they do that?&rsquo; To me, it is a blatant sign of intimidation and harassment, I mean, 42 years after the Stonewall riots and we still have to live in fear of the police disturbing our quiet enjoyment of life? I just don&rsquo;t understand. We are very peaceful.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Daniel P. Dromm, a city councilman from Queens who is gay, expressed concern on Saturday over reports over the years of officers entering bars on the Friday night before Gay Pride weekend.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;There needs to be some sensitivity to the importance of gay marriage being legalized in New York State, which means this vote for marriage is going to have national reverberations,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Not a good time for cops to be going into a gay bar for no urgent reason.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> On Saturday, accounts of what happened in Chelsea were pouring in to Mr. Stringer, Mr. Dromm and others and were being discussed both online and at gatherings around the city to celebrate the new law.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Some reacted angrily. Allen Roskoff, 61, a veteran gay-rights activist who was not at the Eagle, said, &ldquo;In typical New York City Police Department fashion, the N.Y.P.D. demonstrated its disrespect for the gay community by raiding the Eagle mere moments after the passage of most important piece of gay rights legislation in history.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> But some accounts of the inspection diverged significantly, in places, from what the police described. For instance, Mr. Berk said the inspection lasted about two hours, while Mr. Browne said it was completed in about 45 minutes.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Along with flashlights being shined in people&rsquo;s faces, lights were turned off and patrons were forced to empty their pockets &ldquo;without probable cause,&rdquo; Mr. Shevlin said.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Mr. Browne insisted that the inspection &ldquo;had nothing to do with the vote&rdquo; or with Gay Pride weekend. Those on the task force, he said, &ldquo;are not seers; they don&rsquo;t have a crystal ball that tells them when Albany is going to take up a piece of legislation.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;We are treating everyone the same here,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It has nothing to do with the sexual preference of the patrons; it has to do with complaints. It is blind to who the club is and it was planned weeks before.&rdquo; He also denied accusations of aggressive police action.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;The notion that anyone was searched or the lights were turned off is utter fabrication,&rdquo; Mr. Browne said. The police, he said, lowered the music and turned the lights up a bit to see more clearly. &ldquo;The only contact the police had with anyone there was the lieutenant shaking hands with the proprietor,&rdquo; he said. The bar was not padlocked, and there were no arrests.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Mr. Berk said while he wished the inspection had been done during the day to avoid disrupting his business, the officers &ldquo;were just doing their job.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> He planned to visit the 10th Precinct station house on Saturday, he said, to speak with commanders, with whom he said he had a good relationship.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> A law enforcement official said the commander of the 10th Precinct who is responsible for determining a list of locations that were subject to chronic complaints, and were therefore eligible for the inspections, was Deputy Inspector Elisa Cokkinos.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

			<title>Legalize same-sex marriage</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/legalize-same-sex-marriage]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span size="12" style="font-size: small;"> ALBANY, N.Y. &ndash; <strong>New York</strong> is poised to become the sixth, and largest, state to legalize same-sex marriage after the state Senate voted late Friday in favor of a gay marriage bill. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has promised to sign it, and gay weddings could begin 30 days later.<br /><br /> The measure, which the Democratic-controlled Assembly in an earlier version, was backed by four Republicans and 29 Democrats in the GOP-controlled Senate.<br /><br /> "We are leaders and we join other proud states that recognize our families and the battle will now go on in other sGay rights advocates are hoping the vote will galvanize the movement around the United States and help it regain momentum after an almost identical bill was defeated here in 2009 and similar measures failed in 2010 in New Jersey and this year in Maryland and Rhode Island. Though New York is a relative latecomer in allowing gay marriage, it is considered an important prize for advocates, given the state's size and New York City's international stature and its role as the birthplace of the gay rights movement, which is considered to have started with the Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village in 1969.<br /><br /> The New York bill cleared the Republican-controlled state Senate on a 33-29 vote. The Democrat-led Assembly, which passed a different version last week, is expected to pass the new version with stronger religious exemptions.<br /><br /> The effects of the law could be felt well beyond New York: Unlike Massachusetts, which pioneered gay marriage in 2004, New York has no residency requirement for obtaining a marriage license, meaning the state could become a magnet for gay couples across the country who want to have a wedding in Central Park, the Hamptons, the romantic Hudson Valley or that honeymoon hot spot of yore, Niagara Falls.<br /><br /> New York, the nation's third most populous state, will join Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and the Washington capital district in allowing same-sex couples to wed. For five months in 2008, gay marriage was legal in California, the biggest state in population, and 18,000 same-sex couples rushed to tie the knot there before voters overturned the state Supreme Court ruling that allowed the practice. The constitutionality of California's ban is now before a federal appeals court.<br /><br /> The passage of New York's legislation was made possible by two Republican senators who had been undecided.<br /><br /> Sen. Stephen Saland pledged the deciding vote. He voted against a similar bill in 2009, helping kill the measure and dealing a blow to the national gay rights movement.<br /><br /> "While I understand that my vote will disappoint many, I also know my vote is a vote of conscience," Saland said in a statement to The Associated Press before the vote. "I am doing the right thing in voting to support marriage equality."<br /><br /> Gay couples in gallery wept during Saland's speech.<br /><br /> While court challenges in New York are all but certain, the state -- unlike California -- makes it difficult for the voters to repeal laws at the ballot box. Changing the law would require a constitutional convention, a long, drawn-out process.<br /><br /> The sticking point over the past few days: Republican demands for stronger legal protections for religious groups that fear they will be hit with discrimination lawsuits if they refuse to allow their facilities to be used for gay weddings.<br /><br /> The climactic vote came after more than a week of stop-and-start negotiations, rumors, closed-door meetings and frustration on the part of advocates. Online discussions took on a nasty turn with insults and vulgarities peppering the screens of opponents and supporters alike and security was beefed up in the capitol to give senators easier passage to and from their conference room. The night before, President Barack Obama encouraged lawmakers to support gay rights during a fundraiser with New York City's gay community. The vote also is sure to charge up annual gay pride events this weekend, culminating with parades Sunday in New York City, San Francisco and other cities.<br /><br /> Despite New York City's liberal Democratic politics and large and vocal gay community, previous efforts to legalize same-sex marriage failed over the past several years, in part because the rest of the state is more conservative than the city.<br /><br /> The bill's success this time reflected the powerful support of Cuomo and perhaps a change in public attitudes. Opinion polls for the first time are showing majority support for same-sex marriage, and Congress recently repealed the "don't ask, don't tell" policy that barred gays from serving openly in the military.<br /><br /> In the week leading up to the vote in New York, some Republicans who opposed the bill in 2009 came forward to say they were supporting it for reasons of conscience and a duty to ensure civil rights. Pressure to vote for gay marriage also came from celebrities, athletes and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the Republican-turned-independent who has long used his own fortune to help bankroll Republican campaigns and who personally lobbied some undecided lawmakers. Lady Gaga has been urging her 11 million Twitter followers to call New York senators in support of the bill. While the support of the Assembly was never in doubt, it took days of furious deal-making to secure two Republican votes needed for passage in the closely divided Senate.<br /><br /> Representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, Orthodox rabbis and other conservative religious leaders fought the measure, and their Republican allies pressed hard for stronger legal protections for religious organizations.<br /><br /> Each side of the debate was funded by more than $1 million from national and state advocates who waged media blitzes and promised campaign cash for lawmakers who sided with them.<br /><br /> But Republican senators said it was Cuomo's passionate appeals in the governor's mansion on Monday night and in closed-door, individual meetings that were perhaps most persuasive.<br /><br /> The bill makes New York only the third state, after Vermont and New Hampshire, to legalize marriage through a legislative act and without being forced to do so by a court.<br /><br /><br /><br /> The Associated Press contributed to this report.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Read more: http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2011/06/24/gay-marriage-headed-to-vote-on-ny-senate-floor/#ixzz1QFwYUNtKtates," said Sen.

The bill makes New York only the third state, after Vermont and New Hampshire, to legalize marriage through a legislative act and without being forced to do so by a court.

<p><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> As I look at my long muscular nude body in mirror, I look at myself as a thing beauty. I lightly touch my skin with my long gentle fingers. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I gently touch my smooth coca skin; which is flawless in every way. My eyes are almond shaped with a golden-brown, my lips are full of life and love and my nose is perfect as if God gave it to me. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> My breasts are hard and small, just perfect for the perfect person. My abs is tight and hard, as well as, my legs and the rest of my body. I am made beautiful in every way. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Women are beautiful creatures from God. We are strong, have strength, have might, communicators, leaders, and have the greatest sense of emotion. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Women can have waterfalls of sweet juices of love and life with only a touch. By the right touch, a woman will love you for life. Touch her and she will moan, feel her energy and she will melt in your hands. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Women are emotional creatures. We feed on emotion. Emotion is our passion and our fire. Emotion is our desire. Emotion is equal to women. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> One night, I was with my partner and we just kissed each other. The kiss was insane and blew my mind. It gave me a rush inside my body and I was floating on air. My eyes rolled to the back of my head; I felt high and alive. It was the most perfect kiss with a touch to match. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In sex, women are not always looking for penetration, but a touch and kiss can go a long way. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Talking is always good. A whisper in the ear, and a lick here and there will make her go insane. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Remember sex is sex. Making love is making love. Most men and some women forget that sex and making love is not the same, but two different actions with two different results. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In a loving relationship, communication is always the key, even if you two don&rsquo;t agree on a topic or a matter. A couple can&rsquo;t be afraid to discuss topics. If you want someone to always agree with you, you can marry your hand or a robot. The choice is yours. But, know this; your partner should always be your best friend; who&rsquo;s an extension of you. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> This is the differences between men and women. Women feed on emotion to drive them as men need to lead and protect. It&rsquo;s in our DNA. </span><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<center><span style="font-size: medium;"><b>The New Skinheads of the Afro Gene</b></span><br /><span style="font-size: medium;"> By Aliya Leigh</span></center>
<p><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Black people need to go back into slavery. Yes, I do believe Blacks have forgotten what it feels like to be an outcast in society. Blacks are becoming the new members of the KKK. Yes, I said it, Skinheads look out. Your brothers from a different color.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> To me, it seems that the Blacks in this country don&rsquo;t think gay rights are the same as civil rights.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The New Skinheads of the Afro Gene By Aliya Leigh
 Black people need to go back into slavery. Yes, I do believe Blacks have forgotten what it feels like to be an outcast in society. Blacks are becoming the new members of the KKK. Yes, I said it, Skinheads look out. Your brothers from a different color. To me, it seems that the Blacks in this country don&rsquo;t think gay rights are the same as civil rights. Civil rights are about rights of individuals&rsquo; freedom from unwarranted infringement by governments and private organizations and ensure one&rsquo;s ability to participate in the civil and political life of the state without discrimination or repression.  So what is the difference between Civil Rights and Gay Rights? Nothing. It&rsquo;s the same deal. Like HELLO.

<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">I was talking to some religious people about the bible and homosexuality. I was excepting an answer like the normal stuff, but I got something extra; which I needed to share with you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Now, I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re gay, straight or bi, but these questions are for any married couple.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Why did you get married? What makes a real marriage?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What are the key components in marriage?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">It&rsquo;s amazing how people have their own view of marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>From an open marriage to a marriage business agreement; you can see why people&rsquo;s view of marriage is so warped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Now, I am totally for gay marriage. The main reason is legal arrangements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With a legal marriage, you have rights over property, legal family member and cheaper taxes. With marriage you become one flesh so the two partners share everything together, even medical information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So, those are the benefits of a legal marriage.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Why do people get married and is there sex involved in this arrangement?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">You guys know, I love sex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s like a release for me, like my high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But, I will like to find the one who I can spend my life and body with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am only looking for one person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">My stand on marriage is two people who love each other to the point of death and Hades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Yeah, I know that is not all real, but I can still dream.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>In a marriage, is sex important? Let see.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">By speaking to people, I have learned sex is not the most important thing in a marriage, but intimacy is very important. A glance at your partner&rsquo;s body as they get out of the shower, looking into their eyes and thinking about holding them forever,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>touching, kissing, feeling, talking or even doing a chore can be intimate and a sexual intense gesture. From personal experience, just looking at my girlfriend<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>walking out of the shower just made me want to take her and make her scream until she fell asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Holding hands, texting and sending a picture is so sexual, this can make a marriage fresh and new every day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>My parents have been married since the age of the dinosaurs, but they have a Friday date night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They date each other once a week to refresh the marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">But, let&rsquo;s talk about sex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What is sex?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Sex is when two people make love with each other. But, again this is open to interpretation why?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Some people believe sex in a marriage is only for making children. In the bible God told Adam and Eve to have children, so you men and women should only get <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>married to have children. WTH?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">So, in other words, you are telling me, I can&rsquo;t have sex with my husband or wife, only if we are ready to have a family! What?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You got to be kidding? So, if that&rsquo;s the case, why do old people get marriage?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They can&rsquo;t have babies.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Getting back to my story, the religious people told me that, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be with a woman and I need to be single for the rest of my life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I can have friends to kill the void of companionship&rdquo;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">But, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I have some male friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They treat their partners differently then their friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>With friends, you can share ideas and thoughts with; with a partner you can share your whole life because you become one flesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is the main reason why people do get married.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">In marriage, sex is important, but with a twist.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For a woman, you can have an orgasm with a kiss or a touch. To me, this is a sexual experience. Sharing your body with the one you love, is the most exotic experience ever and can you get wet whenever you see them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They can be smelly and sick and you will still what to make them scream.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">One example, I was with a girl, Miss June of 2009, she was a rebound girl because I just broke up with my first love.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Sex and Marriage
By Aliya Leigh

I was talking to some religious people about the bible and homosexuality. I was excepting an answer like the normal stuff, but I got something extra; which I needed to share with you.&nbsp; Now, I don&rsquo;t care if you&rsquo;re gay, straight or bi, but these questions are for any married couple.
Why did you get married? What makes a real marriage?&nbsp; What are the key components in marriage?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s amazing how people have their own view of marriage.&nbsp; From an open marriage to a marriage business agreement; you can see why people&rsquo;s view of marriage is so warped.&nbsp;
Now, I am totally for gay marriage. The main reason is legal arrangements.&nbsp; With a legal marriage, you have rights over property, legal family member and cheaper taxes. With marriage you become one flesh so the two partners share everything together, even medical information.&nbsp; So, those are the benefits of a legal marriage.
Why do people get married and is there sex involved in this arrangement?
You guys know, I love sex.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like a release for me, like my high.&nbsp; But, I will like to find the one who I can spend my life and body with.&nbsp; I am only looking for one person.
My stand on marriage is two people who love each other to the point of death and Hades.&nbsp; Yeah, I know that is not all real, but I can still dream.&nbsp; In a marriage, is sex important? Let see.
By speaking to people, I have learned sex is not the most important thing in a marriage, but intimacy is very important. A glance at your partner&rsquo;s body as they get out of the shower, looking into their eyes and thinking about holding them forever,&nbsp; touching, kissing, feeling, talking or even doing a chore can be intimate and a sexual intense gesture. From personal experience, just looking at my girlfriend&nbsp; walking out of the shower just made me want to take her and make her scream until she fell asleep.&nbsp; Holding hands, texting and sending a picture is so sexual, this can make a marriage fresh and new every day.&nbsp; My parents have been married since the age of the dinosaurs, but they have a Friday date night.&nbsp; They date each other once a week to refresh the marriage.&nbsp;
But, let&rsquo;s talk about sex.&nbsp; What is sex?&nbsp; Sex is when two people make love with each other. But, again this is open to interpretation why?&nbsp;
Some people believe sex in a marriage is only for making children. In the bible God told Adam and Eve to have children, so you men and women should only get &nbsp;married to have children. WTH?
So, in other words, you are telling me, I can&rsquo;t have sex with my husband or wife, only if we are ready to have a family! What?&nbsp; You got to be kidding? So, if that&rsquo;s the case, why do old people get marriage?&nbsp; They can&rsquo;t have babies.
Getting back to my story, the religious people told me that, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t be with a woman and I need to be single for the rest of my life.&nbsp; I can have friends to kill the void of companionship&rdquo;.&nbsp;
But, that doesn&rsquo;t make sense.&nbsp; I have some male friends.&nbsp; They treat their partners differently then their friends.&nbsp; With friends, you can share ideas and thoughts with; with a partner you can share your whole life because you become one flesh.&nbsp; This is the main reason why people do get married.&nbsp;
In marriage, sex is important, but with a twist.&nbsp; For a woman, you can have an orgasm with a kiss or a touch. To me, this is a sexual experience. Sharing your body with the one you love, is the most exotic experience ever and can you get wet whenever you see them.&nbsp; They can be smelly and sick and you will still what to make them scream.

Sex is not about doing it like a porn video, but it has meaning and understanding behind it. Why do people get married?&nbsp; They want to share the rest of their lives with that one person, who they want to be with.]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/shadow-creatures-check-it-out-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">Shadow Creatures is about:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: small;">My name is E and this is my dark life! My family and I came from the devil himself because he had to prove a point to God.&nbsp; We look normal on the surface with rosy glasses, but inside -our dark souls - we are monsters within. Human flesh is our delicate delight and human blood is our sweet delicious wine. This is the Saxton's family secret. &nbsp;I'm a Shadow Creature. This is my life.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br /><br /> <a href="http://shadowcreatures.wordpress.com"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_hsOHV1AzPM8/TbzgbAXMlyI/AAAAAAAAESw/aoiLYhmQ6jE/s400/familytree_done.jpg" height="326" width="400" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" /></a> <br /><br /></p>
<p><br /><span size="2" style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><br /> <span style="font-size: small;"><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Post</span>: A Goddess Among Thieves</b></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> When I walk into a room, I am God and the Normals are my prey. With a lick of my lips, they quiver. With my smile, they wonder. With my glance, they pee in their pants. Yes, I rule them, like the rats that they are. I am God in their eyes.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> It&rsquo;s so funny for a teenager with black wavy long hair, thin body, white as pure snow and the violet of eyes can strike fear into a soul of a Normal; I laugh when I think about it. It&rsquo;s so funny, a little girl like me, holds so much power over people who believes in an unknown nothing.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Anyways&hellip;.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> My name is Trinity. My father named me. He wanted me to be the most special grandchild of our crazy ass family. Yep. Think about it, The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit in ONE vessel or vase; which is me. Yes, I am all three and have special abilities then my own twin brother and the rest of my family. Even Spirit, is afraid of me. Why I&rsquo;m special or the chosen one, I don&rsquo;t know or care. I love it and no one can take it away from me; not even the stupid The One. Who gives a care about The One? If The One is around, It needs to kick my butt as if I was made out of gold.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> My brother and I go to a very very private school; which you will think was created and built by King Solomon himself. The hallways are laced with gold, our lockers are encrusted with jewels, and our flat ware is from Tiffany&rsquo;s. We have doormen for our classrooms and private transportation to take us to and from school. I bet if my classmates and I put our trust funds together, we can solve the National Debt.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> For me, I love Normals taste, skin, juices, blood and their stomachs. The stomach is the best part. You can tell a lot about aNormal from the stomach. My brother, love theNormal skin. I don&rsquo;t blame him. The skin is the best part too. When you put honey and BBQ on aNormal skin and bake the body in the oven &ndash; the taste is heaven. The skin is so crispy and juicy. My mouth is watery just thinking about it. Pulling the skin off the bone is heaven. The taste is so rich and the when the skin melts in your mouth and can roll your eyes back and praise a spirit that is unknown.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The taste and delight of Normalis so so good, I wish I can eat them one by one. I love an oven baked body of a Normal. My favorite is Black and Spanish. Pure Nazi White meat is too dry and boring; it&rsquo;s like eating Greens. Yuck! Black and Spanish people are spicy, hot and have so much favor. Mixed race is good too, but the pure is better.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> My uncle Bryan invented fake Normal meat and blood. It tastes worst then Pure Nazi White meat, but it helps me live. My people can eat other meat like chicken, goat, turkey and beef. But, it&rsquo;s not the same. I love Normals. My parents, brothers and sisters all love Normal meat and we try to stay away for the chicken and other crap. But, we follow the rules about eating the real thing, we have to eat the fake crap or my aunt Erika will punish my mother.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> There&rsquo;s a lot of crazy stuff happening in my family. Max is half vamp, Spirit is doing her job (STRANGE), Rebecca is taking more of an interest, Fire got her orders and E is in love with Thor. It&rsquo;s like a soap opera with Supernatural all over it. Funny but true. Instead of watching TV, I get the updated news from our family sect advisor; Matthew. If Simon Peter knew about Matthew, Matthew will disappear. It&rsquo;s funny; this post will go on the web. Let us say, Matthew have not been working out as an advisor.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> With any advisor, if you don&rsquo;t kiss my butt then you will get hurt. Simple rule, right? While, you know, some people are slow.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> My sister Oriana called me today. I miss her. She&rsquo;s my role model and my best friend. Oriana is the first born and is loved by my parents. Her name means Sunrise because her face is like the Sun. She has olive skin, dark yellow eyes and bright blonde hair. She&rsquo;s so beautiful and amazing but don&rsquo;t mess with her &ndash; she can burn.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Oriana and Spirit are business partners and best friends; although Spirit is older. I did ask Oriana about Spirit renewed interest in the family.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Oriana said, &ldquo;Spirit is bored. She needs something to excite her&rdquo;.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Oriana is right, Spirit is so old; I don&rsquo;t think Spirit knows her real age.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Oh yeah, my special abilities, I do have them. I possess them deep into my white bones: Pride, Envy, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Honor, Worship, Angry and The Touch of God. My skin is made out of the purest gold, my eyes are diamonds, my scent is rare perfume and my touch is Godlike. I am an idol to all things, big and small. A loose hair strand becomes a recital and my nail clippings are worshiped like an idol. I am God on Earth. One reason, I am feared.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Shadow Creatures is about:&nbsp;
My name is E and this is my dark life! My family and I came from the devil himself because he had to prove a point to God.&nbsp; We look normal on the surface with rosy glasses, but inside -our dark souls - we are monsters within. Human flesh is our delicate delight and human blood is our sweet delicious wine. This is the Saxton's family secret. &nbsp;I'm a Shadow Creature. This is my life.&nbsp;
  
 New Post: A Goddess Among Thieves When I walk into a room, I am God and the Normals are my prey. With a lick of my lips, they quiver. With my smile, they wonder. With my glance, they pee in their pants. Yes, I rule them, like the rats that they are. I am God in their eyes. It&rsquo;s so funny for a teenager with black wavy long hair, thin body, white as pure snow and the violet of eyes can strike fear into a soul of a Normal; I laugh when I think about it. It&rsquo;s so funny, a little girl like me, holds so much power over people who believes in an unknown nothing. Anyways&hellip;. My name is Trinity. My father named me. He wanted me to be the most special grandchild of our crazy ass family. Yep. Think about it, The Father, The Son and The Holy Spirit in ONE vessel or vase; which is me. Yes, I am all three and have special abilities then my own twin brother and the rest of my family. Even Spirit, is afraid of me. Why I&rsquo;m special or the chosen one, I don&rsquo;t know or care. I love it and no one can take it away from me; not even the stupid The One. Who gives a care about The One? If The One is around, It needs to kick my butt as if I was made out of gold. My brother and I go to a very very private school; which you will think was created and built by King Solomon himself. The hallways are laced with gold, our lockers are encrusted with jewels, and our flat ware is from Tiffany&rsquo;s.

With hearing this, they got into an argument and my mother left in anger. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[I live in Phoenix, Arizona and I have been seeing billboards which say "SAVE THE DATE - May 21 2011". What does this mean? &nbsp;Judgment Day!!!
&nbsp;
PLEASE!!!! &nbsp;As I understand from the bible, the angels or anyone don't know the time, the day or the hour, so how can we save the date? &nbsp;
&nbsp;
This is so funny! Why? &nbsp;Ok, let me tell you:
1) My mother just lost her firstborn child named Aliya, who was supposed to be my older sister. This was the year 1975.&nbsp;
2) My mother was very depressed and had to visit her grandmother, who was my great-grandmother. &nbsp;My great-grandmother was a Jehovah's Witness. &nbsp;She told my mother, the world will end in the year, 1976. With hearing this, they got into an argument and my mother left in anger. &nbsp;
3) My mother wanted to get pregnant again and decided if she was going to die; her unborn child will die too. But, my great-grandmother's words got the best of her. My mother started to study the bible with Jehovah's Witnesses.&nbsp;
4) My mother converted and I was born April 19, 1976. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
5) As you can see, I am still alive. &nbsp;I am typing this right now, in my bed, half nude. I'm a beautiful opinionate, loud - mouth, blogger and podcaster Republican. &nbsp;Who had written 3 books, 4 scripts, have an apparel and skateboard design line and producing a web show. &nbsp;
Just think, if the world ended before I was born, you guys would never have the joy to know me and be in my presence.&nbsp; LOL.&nbsp; So, yes, this is funny to me. &nbsp;
&nbsp;
But, here is the news article and videos below. &nbsp;

May 21, 2011: Judgment Day Rumors&nbsp;Spread Across The US
The Huffington Post&nbsp;&nbsp;Dean Praetorius
May 21, 2011 will mark the second coming of Christ, or at least that's what some Christian groups believe.
The date was calculated by Harold Camping, the leader of an independent Christian ministry called Family Radio Worldwide, which is based in Oakland, Calif. Camping's date is based on his interpretation of the bible.
Camping's group isn't the only one following hisapocalyptic prediction&nbsp;though. A number of loosely affiliated websites and radio broadcasts have created a movement independent of churches that have organized to proclaim the day as the&nbsp;end of the world.
Billboards, bus stop benches, and travelling caravans of RVs from Bridgeport, Conn. to Little Rock, Ark. are being used to spread the word, according to the AP. Allison Warden (pictured) has been helping to organize the campaign not only through billboards and post cards, but through the web, using her siteWe Can Know.
Camping, 89, says the bible acts as a calendar by which the dates of prophecies can be calculated. "Beyond the shadow of a doubt, May 21 will be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment," he toldthe AP.
While this isn't the first time that the end of the world has been predicted, there are many believers that will adhere to the date, even if it passes. "It would be like telling the Wright brothers that every other attempt to fly has failed, so you shouldn't even try," Chris McCann, who works with eBible Fellowship,&nbsp;told the AP.
UPDATE: CNN has since taken a close look at 'Project Caravan,' the mobile movement preaching the end of the world. For more, watch the clip from CNN below.

			<title>Exclusive Interview with my girls 3minds - The Queerest Marketing Group</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/exclusive-interview-with-my-girls-3minds-the-queerist-marketing-group]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="www.my3minds.com"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_hsOHV1AzPM8/TbNprz10NtI/AAAAAAAAESU/KFi6hDlG4So/s144/IMG_2193.JPG" height="96" width="144" /></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">I love these girls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>These girls have so much fun in public, that at first, I thought they were a dance group. Then I found out, they are a marketing group who helps out the small businesses in the Queer Community. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>So, with that in mind, you need to hire them because they put the fun and entertainment back into marketing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial; font-size: small;">Look at the picture; I want to be around them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span size="3" style="font-size: small;"> <b>What is 3minds?</b><br /> 3minds is a small business geared towards the LGBTQ Community. As a small business we understand how difficult it was to build 3minds from the ground up so we wanted to pay it forward. Recently, we began offering affordable advertising for other small business owners using our vast networking connections to get a jump start on their business, and reach their target audience. In addition, we host events, parties, red carpets etc. When 3minds is at your party or event we turn it up. <br /><br /> <b>Who is in the group?</b><br /> The 3 members of 3minds are Linn, Daya, &amp; Nikkie. <br /><br /> <b>How did 3minds get started?</b><br /> We were introduced to one another by a mutual friend after church. During conversation we all agreed the community needed to see lesbians from a positive perspective. From that day on in 2008 we began to create products, produce events, and media outlets that would show the faces of the LGBTQ community <br /><br /> <b>Do you feel that the Queer community has made advancements in the social stigma?</b> <br /> While we believe there is so much to still be done for many of us that have been out for sometime (lol, not telling our ages). We can all agree that we didn&rsquo;t see magazines made for us, by us and now we have IKONS and No Labelz magazine in stores like Barnes and Nobles and Borders...We didn&rsquo;t see small businesses similar to 3Minds&hellip;We didn&rsquo;t see celebrities coming out and still having lucrative careers such as Ellen, Wanda Sykes and others. With all that being said, there is still so much work to be done and we plan to put our time in. It&rsquo;s bigger than us.<br /><br /> <b>What does Gay Pride mean to you?</b><br /> Being gay doesn&rsquo;t define us. We&rsquo;re all accomplished women who happen to love women. When we think of &ldquo;Pride&rdquo; in itself, a couple of things come to mind&hellip;dignity, self acceptance and self respect.<br /><br /> <b>If you have a wish for the Queer community, what will it be?</b><br /> More unity! Self love and love for others. How do people expect society in whole to accept gay love when we look down on each other? <br /><br /> <b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3Minds</span></b><br /> <i>&ldquo;Creatively, we never sleep&rdquo;</i><br /><br /><br /> <b>Linn</b><br /> Director of Marketing &amp; Events<br /> 3minds08@gmail.com<br /> www.my3minds.com<br /> Twitter: @3minds<br /> </span></p>]]></description>

I love these girls.&nbsp; These girls have so much fun in public, that at first, I thought they were a dance group. Then I found out, they are a marketing group who helps out the small businesses in the Queer Community. &nbsp;So, with that in mind, you need to hire them because they put the fun and entertainment back into marketing. 
Look at the picture; I want to be around them.&nbsp;
 What is 3minds? 3minds is a small business geared towards the LGBTQ Community. As a small business we understand how difficult it was to build 3minds from the ground up so we wanted to pay it forward. Recently, we began offering affordable advertising for other small business owners using our vast networking connections to get a jump start on their business, and reach their target audience. In addition, we host events, parties, red carpets etc. When 3minds is at your party or event we turn it up.  Who is in the group? The 3 members of 3minds are Linn, Daya, &amp; Nikkie.  How did 3minds get started? We were introduced to one another by a mutual friend after church. During conversation we all agreed the community needed to see lesbians from a positive perspective. From that day on in 2008 we began to create products, produce events, and media outlets that would show the faces of the LGBTQ community  Do you feel that the Queer community has made advancements in the social stigma?  While we believe there is so much to still be done for many of us that have been out for sometime (lol, not telling our ages). We can all agree that we didn&rsquo;t see magazines made for us, by us and now we have IKONS and No Labelz magazine in stores like Barnes and Nobles and Borders...We didn&rsquo;t see small businesses similar to 3Minds&hellip;We didn&rsquo;t see celebrities coming out and still having lucrative careers such as Ellen, Wanda Sykes and others. With all that being said, there is still so much work to be done and we plan to put our time in. It&rsquo;s bigger than us. What does Gay Pride mean to you? Being gay doesn&rsquo;t define us. We&rsquo;re all accomplished women who happen to love women. When we think of &ldquo;Pride&rdquo; in itself, a couple of things come to mind&hellip;dignity, self acceptance and self respect. If you have a wish for the Queer community, what will it be? More unity! Self love and love for others. How do people expect society in whole to accept gay love when we look down on each other?  3Minds &ldquo;Creatively, we never sleep&rdquo; Linn Director of Marketing &amp; Events 3minds08@gmail.com www.my3minds.com Twitter: @3minds ]]></itunes:subtitle>

She&rsquo;s a wonderful writer and blogger. I have become a fan of hers when I joined into this crazy weird Twitter site. LOL. I have been following her for a while and she has inspired me to live life to the fullest, be true to yourself and others, be spiritual and still have a deep grounding in faith.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I was always had been curious about her because she has such a Dark Goth side to her, but so sweet, like a corpse with a lotus flower growing inside of her. So, of course, I had to interview her. Plus, she wanted to promote her NEW project. </span><br /> <br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Remember the name Sister Sadist because she&rsquo;s about to blow up soon!</span><br /> <br /><strong><span style="font-size: small;"> Tell me about yourself? </span></strong><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Well - My real name is Camicia, I'm a Florida native, I've lived here all of my life. I've been with my husband for a little over 10 years. I live for the quiet life. My days revolve around yoga, my writing, my husband and my pets. Oh and wine. I'm a huge wine nerd! </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="font-size: small;"></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Currently, live in a small town called Ormond Beach, FL. We are a small suburb just north of Daytona Beach - home of NASCAR, Bike Week and MTV's original spring break party (from WAY back in the 80's!) </span><br /> <br /><strong><span style="font-size: small;"> Why do you call yourself Sister Sadist?</span></strong><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The story behind the name isn't nearly as exciting as the moniker itself. Ages ago I was a huge online gamer (I played World of Warcraft for roughly 4 years), I was the group leader for about 200 people and had a reputation for being fairly strict with the group rules. I started to build a reputation for being a sadist and when I started a Priest character the name Sister Sadist came up in honor of the female equivalent of Priests (Think Sister Mary-Catherine the Catholic School teacher) and my strict disciplinary tactics! </span><br /> <br /><strong><span style="font-size: small;"> What do you write about? </span></strong><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Everything! Lately, my focus has been on my spiritual journey and recognizing my own self-worth and capabilities. I write a lot about finding a path to God but without the constraints of religion. I'm a huge yoga fanatic so I write a bit about that as well and how my practice tends to sometimes guide me to God. </span><br /> <br /><strong><span style="font-size: small;"> You mention about a project that you are working on, what is it?</span></strong><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I'm working on building a woman's community website called <strong>The Well Written Woman</strong> (TheWellWrittenWoman.com) - we launch May 1.

            <description><![CDATA[<div style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 10pt; background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; min-height: 1100px; counter-reset: __goog_page__ 0; line-height: normal; padding: 0px; margin: 6px;">
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; margin: 0px;"><b>Deep Wounds</b></p>
<p align="center" class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: center; margin: 0px;">By Aliya Leigh</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The wound was so deep&hellip; Like gush spewing blood that made B cry out in pain and anguish.&nbsp; The wound was deep within her soul, was as if someone had poured a gallon of salt water in the wound. She hated the feeling that nothing would be able to heal &nbsp;the wound.&nbsp; She wanted it to kill herself slowly hoping she would die with feeling, but the wound made her hollow inside.&nbsp; The wound made her not feel; the sense of touch, pain, love or any other human emotion at all.&nbsp; The wound made her hollow as if she was already dead, like the walking dead without a sense of belonging or self.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">To think back, B didn&rsquo;t have a care in the world for anyone; only herself.&nbsp; She was</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">self center cunt. She would never think twice about anyone because she didn&rsquo;t give a shit.&nbsp; Now, she cares, why? Because a girl broke the one thing she only had; heart.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B walks around in the apartment trying to think.&nbsp; She sat down on a couch.&nbsp; The wound is deep and the pain is torture.&nbsp; She looks at the sharp kitchen knives; there is one, a knife that can cut through anything.&nbsp; She looks at them and studies them.&nbsp; She could use the knife to curve out the deep wound in her heart.&nbsp; She wanted to do it, but she was a coward.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Damn, damn, damn,&rdquo; all that come out of B mouth, but no feeling or knowledge of the words, only nothing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The wound is so deep, that to cure it, she needs to be a hollow &ndash; a person that is nothing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">******************************************************************</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Yaa, Yeah, Yaa, Yaa,&rdquo; the moans of sexual torture B made.&nbsp; She was in sexual heaven and hell all at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Oh, god...&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; B said over and over again in a sexually charged tortured love song.&nbsp; This would be the tenth time she has cum and the women were not planning on stopping.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The torture made her feel human &ndash; pain of life, the joy of sex and the fear of no control, all at the same time.&nbsp; She enjoys that feeling more than having an orgy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She couldn&rsquo;t move and was powerless, in her own bedroom.&nbsp; She was blindfolded and tied to her own rod iron bed, each limb tied to a single post; suspended above the mattress. This bed frame had been custom made just for this purpose.&nbsp; Each post of her been was specially designed so that a rope could be tied securely even against the struggles brought on by her sexual play.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">So there she was suspended above her own mattress with one woman sucking and lapping at the delicate folds of her pussy while alternately sucking her clit, while the other wiped her with leather riding wipe. You could hear &nbsp;the force of the blows to her skin, with each crack of the wipe she was brought closer to orgasm. With each passing moment and each blow the flesh of her body would rise in an angry red line. B didn&rsquo;t feel the leather against her skin because to her, it felt like a sensual tongue licking and teasing her most sensitive of body parts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She cried out in a tortured sexual bliss.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Oh, Ohh, Ohhh, Fuck, Ohhh&rdquo;, B cried out, not wanting these twisted felling of ecstasy to stop.&nbsp; She was cuming, the juices from her hot pussy where dribble out creating an ever growing puddle in the bed below. The intensity of the pain brought on by the torture and the pleasure that she had been longing for this whole week was at its peak, and she was about to make her pussy into a fountain.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Oh Fuck, Ohh, Ohh&hellip; (ring&hellip; ring&hellip;) What the fuck!,&rdquo; &nbsp;B said as a generic sounding ring tone emanated from the cell phone in a chair off in the corner of the room began to play without any warning.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t fucking stop!&nbsp; Come on!&rdquo; B yelled.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The women continued, but the phone continued as well.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B was doing her best to block out the sound and to concentrate on her own self fulfillment, but the phone never stop, like a bad song stuck in your head.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Stop, just stop, I mean stop. I&rsquo;m serious. Get me down,&rdquo; B said and then cursed under her breath.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The two women untied her as quickly as they could and B took off the blindfold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She got up from her bed in a huff and walked over to her chair.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I thought, I put this thing on silence, damn, this better be good,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The women didn&rsquo;t make a sound, as they were order to apply torture, but never to speak.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B dialed the phone number with her face red with angry, but worry, wondering if someone had died in a plane or car crash, murdered or something dreadful. If not, she was going to kill the person who made her stop her multiple orgasms with no reason.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;What,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Oh, thank god you picked up.&nbsp; I have been calling and calling&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;About what&hellip;, Judy,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Cindy. You know&hellip;,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B wanted to put her hands through the phone and choke the living daylights out of Judy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;What about Cindy? This better be good.&nbsp; I swear, it better be good,&rdquo; B said in a very annoyed sounding voice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Oh, honey, she called me and &hellip;,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;So what&hellip; You want a fuckin prize,&rdquo; B said with a bit of disdain in her voice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;No... Honey.&nbsp; She should be knocking on your door soon.&nbsp; Now, remember your anger management,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Shut up.&nbsp; What the hell?&rdquo; Beatrice asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;She wanted to have sex with the famous hoe of the valley,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, I would rather have sex with a toothless, smelly old woman on skid row in the middle of street, then Cindy, while I&rsquo;m sober,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Tell her that. I&rsquo;m just warning you. See you have a rep,&rdquo; Judy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Please. See you tomorrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll handle this,&rdquo; B said as a knock came from the front door.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B puts the phone down and walks over to the front door naked with not even so much as a tissue cover her shapely form.&nbsp; She opened the door, wide open so that the world at large could admire her toned, shapely, mocha colored body. She was proud of it and went to the gym everyday to keep it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B stood there framed by the door way in front of Cindy with a body that looked like it was shaped by the sculpture of ancient Rome. Her Legs where long and shapely, her pussy hairless still dripping wet with cum, she had perky breast that flowed down to rock hard abs, her arms were toned with a superb definition, and her face was one God molded himself to perfection.&nbsp; Her short red hair made her look like a young girl with a woman&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I want to fuck you,&rdquo; Cindy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Too bad, I have nothing for you,&rdquo; B said as she crossed her arms.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I know you want it.&nbsp; I can give it to you.&nbsp; Look at you, I see you were playing with yourself,&rdquo; Cindy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Why would you say that,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;You left the club alone,&rdquo; Cindy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Because I had an appointment,&rdquo; B turns her head in the apartment, &ldquo;Girls, come here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The women walk over to B and stand in front of Cindy, both on either side of her.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Cindy&rsquo;s eyes showed a bit of surprise and sadness all at the same time, this just as a man was walking his dog only to almost trip and fell.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I know you like what you see old man,&rdquo; B said and the man continued to walk pass her door with an obvious hard on in his pants.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;So, do I look like I&rsquo;m lonely?&rdquo; B asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a slut,&rdquo; Cindy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a hoe.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a big difference,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;You going to catch something,&rdquo; Cindy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;And to think, you wanted to sleep with me. I&rsquo;m the hoe, remember.&nbsp; I sleep around.&nbsp; I have a rep. Did you think, it was fake? I have pleasured and been pleasured. I&rsquo;m just that good.&nbsp; Look, even you want a piece of me.&nbsp; But because I&rsquo;m with two women and just had multiple orgasms, I&rsquo;m a slut.&nbsp; Bitch please.&nbsp; Now, go before I kick your ass down stairs. I&rsquo;m trying to be nice, Good Bye&hellip;&rdquo; B said, closing the door and locking it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B looked at the women in front of her and said, &ldquo;So.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">One woman got down on her knees and started licking B&rsquo;s still dripping pussy and the other stood from behind massaging her breasts.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B was in ecstasy again and her juices started to flow but only slightly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The touching and the licking only made her feel like this was work. Normal and not very exciting, more like something you do to past the time away in a long meeting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She looked down at her stomach and saw the raised red welts across her stomach, she smiled.&nbsp; It reminded her that she could be hurt, she had feeling those of a human, not some arrogant goddess she made herself to be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">After B had her fill of the women and her sexual urges satisfied, the women had their bragging rights and left for the evening.&nbsp; The taste of B was like honey and sweet cream; a flavor so perfect one would crave the taste. The juices made a person&rsquo;s mouth water for days and made you want more, so much so it would make you do anything just to taste that perfectly sweet combination of paradise in your mouth again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Being with the Queen Bitch B, had its perks, but you had to be willing to throw your morals in the trash and be trash in the process.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Little did they know, but B had secrets; she never opened up or trusted anyone.&nbsp; If you thought about it, there must have been a reasons why a street smart with a Masters in English, taught at a local college, who was a screen writer and novelist would want to wear an electric dog collar around her neck, want her body to be in pain due to blunt objects and whips leaving behind bruises, cuts and marks, make her wrist bleed and to be powerless in her own condo twice a month.&nbsp; If only her friends knew; she was sick and troubled, they would have locked her away a long time ago and threw away the key.&nbsp; She would have been forgotten and all her accomplishments would have been a joke.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Why would a person put themselves through torture and pain, to make themselves feel alive? &nbsp;To make them understand fear.&nbsp; To make them understand pain. To make them understand their own existence in the world.&nbsp; B called this therapy; but a normal person would call it madness.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Since B was born into New York City high society, she never knew the meaning of failure or fear.&nbsp; Those two words never entered her mind and never came out of her mouth.&nbsp; She was born to succeed at any cost.&nbsp; She was driven, a goddess in her own mind that she even worshiped herself.&nbsp; But, lonely B had secrets that only she knew and forgot about and no one knew, until she failed for the first time in her life. This unlikely incident made her face her fear dead without the security of her whips and the chains.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s she is, the little hoe,&rdquo; Lisa said as the tired squealed, B walked into the restaurant.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B had on one of her exclusive custom made hats, sunglasses to block out the killer rays of sun and the normal lighting in the restaurant, a tee shirt and jeans, with one of her coach bags and matching sneakers.&nbsp; She looked like a black trash version of Paris Hilton.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She looked to the table and sat down.&nbsp; As always at Sunday brunch the women would stop chatting and there would be silence. She would snap her fingers and the waitress or waiter will place a fresh pot of coffee on the table in front of her, without saying a word. She would lift up her glasses to see the server and would than order her regular breakfast. After the Sunday brunch ritual that her friends knew so well, she would pour the coffee and they would stare at her.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Cindy, she called me last night. You had marks on your body,&rdquo; Lisa said as the women studied her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B looked at all of them as if they were delinquent kids with disciplinary problems. She looked at each one of them, with her thick glasses on, took a breath and shrugged.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Are you being abused?&rdquo; Karen asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B rolled her eyes and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do relationships. Sometimes the fuck gets rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Tracy looked at her in disgust, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why you, an intelligent black woman can&rsquo;t grow up?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B looked at her and took off her glasses.&nbsp; The lights from the ceiling almost blinded her, as if she was locked in a dark cave for days.&nbsp; She continued to blink and rub her eyes to get her focus and then looked at Tracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Why, is this black thing?&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;m black. I know.&nbsp; I look at myself in the mirror everyday.&nbsp; One thing is, I&rsquo;ll never grow up. I&rsquo;m like the female peter pan, but sexy. I love my life and I bet I get more sex then you guys anyway.&nbsp; By the way, if I&rsquo;m such I child, why did you try to date me? So, do you need to grow up too,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">There was as dead silence as the waitress delivers B&rsquo;s food.&nbsp; It was one pancake, one slice of french toast and one egg sunny side up with cheese. The chef made this meal just for her; the meal was called Queen B.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Listen, the way you are going, you&rsquo;ll be alone, what will you do when you can&rsquo;t do your threesomes, quads, orgies, one night stands and all your other things that I don&rsquo;t even what to think about.&nbsp; You know, meaningful relationships that last a long time,&rdquo; Jovanee said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what I want, I&rsquo;ll marry an Asian,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;You can take things seriously,&rdquo; Lisa said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Life shouldn&rsquo;t be serious.&nbsp; Life should be fun and exciting.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t find that in a long-term relationship only in a quick fuck. Liz, you understand,&rdquo; Beatrice said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The group of women looked at the thin long straight black haired Latina in a nice pressed white collared shirt. She could feel their eyes piecing and stabbing every inch of her body. It was as if they were looking into her very soul.&nbsp; They wanted the truth from Liz, since she did pass her hoe crown to Miss B.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Liz looked at them and toke a deep breath, &ldquo;B is right&hellip;,&rdquo; with a long pause, &ldquo;she also wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; B asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;A quick fix is exciting, but knowing you will be awaking up to the same person for years is a powerful experience,&rdquo; Liz said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Until, they leave your ass,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Shut up, QB.&nbsp; I gave her everything, but she still had a thing for the opposite sex.&nbsp; But, I did learn a lot from her, like how to maintain a long-term relationship,&rdquo; Liz said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;You two would still be together, if you were a man.&nbsp; Come on, I love my life. I love how I live.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you just accept that?&nbsp; I feel comfortable in my own skin and practice safe sex, ok.&nbsp; God...&nbsp; I love feeling young, like my college days,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in college,&rdquo; Tracy said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Yes, I am. Remember, I teach class at ASU. So, I&rsquo;m in college. Tracy, age is just a state of mind, not a reminder of old bones or shit like that.&nbsp; When I die, I will die happy,&rdquo; B said and continued to eat and drink.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">All the women at the table knew what type of woman B was.&nbsp; Liz, was the only one that got close to her, but knew she was hiding something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Liz, slept with her once and heard B talking in her sleep, she seemed to be talking to her parents, but when she questioned B about it she simple dismissed it as a regular dream.&nbsp; For a while, Liz and B had a bit of a contest going.&nbsp; It was to see how many women &nbsp;they could sleep with in a month. Since B, doesn&rsquo;t the meaning of failure, she won.&nbsp; Since then, they have been rivals, but remained friends.&nbsp; B had to thank Liz because the contest made her reputation grow in the valley of the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The remainder of the brunch focused on the gay pride events that were coming up next weekend and what if any plans they had. The women wanted to go as a group to show their gay pride; which B wasn&rsquo;t interested in.&nbsp; The only way she showed her pride was having sex with women and turning straight women gay.&nbsp; She felt that she was the gay ambassador for the straight and gay world.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">No one knew why B was a bitch and proud of it.&nbsp; Liz was the only one that knew B was a tormented soul that needed to be help and loved; even though she was accomplished in her field.&nbsp; Liz could only see the glimpse of the goodness B had.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Like the time when Liz was kicked out of their house because her girlfriend of 8 years decided she wanted to move her boyfriend in. B got Liz an apartment and paid the move in cost, gave her some money for food and furniture and was a big support for her.&nbsp; Liz will never forget what B did, but she always wondered why B was the way she was.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">On the outside it all about the sex romps, bad attitude this was all just superficial, but inside Liz knew there was pain and sadness, but didn&rsquo;t know why or what.&nbsp; Only if she knew, she could help Queen B.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">After brunch, the women paid for their meals, said their goodbyes and left.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B walked outside the restaurant and put on her sunglasses.&nbsp; She looked like a young butch girl with a fashion sense. She opened her bag and took out a long thin cigarette. She placed it in her mouth as if she was making a fashion statement, but she never lit it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B looked around her surrounding as if she was in another world; in another time.&nbsp; The restaurant, the stores and streets all changed as the seconds of time ticked away, she could feel her world turning in front of her eyes.&nbsp; She wanted to cry, wanted to laugh, but she didn&rsquo;t want to remember.&nbsp; The memories felt as if salt was being thrown on open wounds; which she tries to stitch up everyday. She felt so alone, confuse and hurt.&nbsp; She hated life. Life wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be so cruel to her, but it was.&nbsp; She looked up at the sky and cursed God. I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck, if it was a man or woman.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t give a damn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She walked passed her red BMW and walked out of the parking lot.&nbsp; She stepped on the sidewalk and walked North.&nbsp; As she walked, she lit her cigarette and started to smoke.&nbsp; She continued to walk and walk, as if she was on a mission to get somewhere fast, but not really knowing where to go.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B crosses the street and step on the sidewalk, where she stopped dead in her &nbsp;tracks.&nbsp; She looked around and everything, the trees, grass, buildings, light poles and even the sidewalks disappeared.&nbsp; It was isolated deserted, wild land there was no civilization in sight except for one house.&nbsp; She walked up and stood in front of the house. She stared at the house as if it were a statue.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The air was dusty, the sun was hot and the land was dry and cracked. It was a desert wilderness, with only one house.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B knew about the house well.&nbsp; It was brown sandstone colored stucco finished house, with a distinctly southwestern look, the house had what looked like a half made attempt at a porch. The windows were sad and the house looked depress, like it needed crank or even meth to make it alive and energized.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She had her last drag of the cigarette and drops it on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Studying the house took her back to her younger rebellious days.&nbsp; The days when she was out of control, a fighter, when knowledge was power and the time was of love and passion.&nbsp; Love and passion, she wanted that again.&nbsp; She yearned for it.&nbsp; She was even willing to die, just to have the Love and the Passion back again. A time when the level of passion reached heights, where her orgasms felt so intense it was as if a thousand tiny needles were piercing he every square inch of body, each one no causing pain but pleasure. It was a com so great, it will forever be written in the history never to be repeated again.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">The mere thought of it made her weak in the knees and she just wanted God to grant her that same pleasure again; she longed for it.&nbsp; For the gift of passion would make her change her life, be more compassionate and her good side would come out, but when she opened her eyes, the dream was gone and the house looked sadder than ever, like it would do anything to be demolished.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">In that moment, B knew what real love was. She had it and felt it, but sometimes good things ends, but the memories are still the same.&nbsp; She only had her memories and she would cherish them in her heart and soul, like a cornerstone to her being.&nbsp; Life was happy then, now it&rsquo;s miserable.&nbsp; One reason, to fuck away the pain.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B saw a stone near her feet and picked it up.&nbsp; She throws it at the house as if she was in her younger years and ran back to her car.&nbsp; The streets, cars, lights, and other buildings started to appear again, but she looked like she had not aged since high school. She pressed the cars button and pulled into street with a bit of a squeal and drove away, as if she was being chased by the police.&nbsp; She raced to her house and cried about the death sentence the house had placed on her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B parked the car and ran into her condo. She was done for &nbsp;the day and life was already done with her.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">During night, as she tossed and turned, the nightmares were coming back to light.&nbsp; Everything that she buried in her soul, the wounds they were coming to the surface and the wounds started to sting and she was unmovable.&nbsp; She needed the pain to be dead.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She awoke in a cold sweat.&nbsp; Her nightmare became reality again and this time she was going to end it.&nbsp; She wanted to end her torture and she was preparing for this moment.&nbsp; All the torture sessions she paid for was going to pay off.&nbsp; She had no fear, she felt no physical pain, and she wanted the ultimate orgasm so she could die with a smile on her face.&nbsp; She was ready.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She walked into her closet. On the top shelf was a black box with a knife in it.&nbsp; She had been planning this for years.&nbsp; As she opened the box, all her emotions came to life as if she was living in it again. In the box was a red velvet bag was a sharp knife that had never been used.&nbsp; Her legs went limp and she slid down the wall.&nbsp; She was ready.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">She slid the knife across her wrist slowly to feel the intensity and sensual feeling of the blade slowly opening her skin like cutting soft butter. The pain made her cum and the wetness began to puddle beneath her. It was heaven. When she was done, the sexual arousal lingered like the last rays of the sun trying hard to stay in the sky. She didn&rsquo;t want to feeling to end.&nbsp; She did the other wrist and cum multiple times once again. It was the best sex she had ever had; she was smiling ear &nbsp;to ear.&nbsp; There was no pain, only pleasure and climax.&nbsp; The knife dropped. She sat there in ecstasy, with her eye close.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; a woman voice asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Hello, what the hell are you doing, you look like shit?&rdquo; the voice said again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">With a hard slap to the face, B woke up.&nbsp; She was in a place with no balance, just floating with a woman looking at her.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Sharon?&rdquo; B asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;What the fuck are you doing?&rdquo; Sharon asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Beatrice blushed and smiled when Sharon talked to her, but Sharon slapped her again. &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo;&nbsp; Sharon asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I missed you. I want to be with you.&nbsp; I need you,&rdquo; B said as the blood was gushing out of her wrists.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I know, but you need to move on.&nbsp; You will always have me. I&rsquo;m always there. I have been helping you, idiot.&nbsp; I have given you good women and you treated them like trash. Why?&rdquo; Sharon asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not you,&rdquo; B said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Of course not, but babe, I&rsquo;m dead. You can&rsquo;t have me,&rdquo; Sharon said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Sharon sat next to B and B put her head in Sharon&rsquo;s breast. B soaked up her smile, energy, spirit, smell and taste. She was whole again, not hollow.&nbsp; She was alive, not a zombie. She was finally at peace.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Babe, you need to live, for me. Please do. I&rsquo;m begging you too. Don&rsquo;t die because of me. I&rsquo;m not worth it.&nbsp; I was a coward and stupid.&nbsp; I should have relied on you. I should have told you everything, but I didn&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not with you. I&rsquo;m a coward. You were always the strong one. &nbsp;Babe, my parents cut me off and I thought I had no one, but I forgot; I had you.&nbsp; You need to survive and be strong,&rdquo; Sharon said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I want to be with you,&rdquo; B said with an ounce of breath.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;Babe, it&rsquo;s not you time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not asking to forget about me, but remember you have a life.&nbsp; Live it.&nbsp; You will find one soon.&nbsp; Promise me you will live your life the way you always wanted and I&rsquo;ll always be there, watching and helping.&nbsp; I love you.&nbsp; I will always love you. You promise never to do this again?&rdquo; Sharon asked.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B looked at her lover and cried, &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Sharon put her hand in her chest and pulls out a piece of her heart. Sharon put the piece in B&rsquo;s chest.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;I will always be with you.&nbsp; Now, live,&rdquo; Sharon said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">With a breath, B opens her eyes slowly. She was in a white room and tubes were in her arm. There were bandages on her wrists.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">In a weakness state, she looked around. She saw Liz by her side.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake.&nbsp; Thank god, I had a key to your apartment.&nbsp; You fool.&nbsp; You tried to kill yourself.&nbsp; If you would have died, who would be the Queen Hoe?&nbsp; I passed the crown to you remember.&nbsp; Plus, honey,&rdquo; Liz said as she stared into B&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;I care so much about you.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d died, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">Liz leans over to B and kissed her gently on the lips as if she was fragile piece of priceless glass. B looked at her and smiled. Liz leans over again and gave B a long passionate kiss. B closed her eyes and thought about what Sharon said.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0px;">B needed to live her life and in the future, she will be joined with Sharon at the end.&nbsp; Soon, she will not be hollow anymore.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[
Deep Wounds
By Aliya Leigh
&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
The wound was so deep&hellip; Like gush spewing blood that made B cry out in pain and anguish.&nbsp; The wound was deep within her soul, was as if someone had poured a gallon of salt water in the wound. She hated the feeling that nothing would be able to heal &nbsp;the wound.&nbsp; She wanted it to kill herself slowly hoping she would die with feeling, but the wound made her hollow inside.&nbsp; The wound made her not feel; the sense of touch, pain, love or any other human emotion at all.&nbsp; The wound made her hollow as if she was already dead, like the walking dead without a sense of belonging or self.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
To think back, B didn&rsquo;t have a care in the world for anyone; only herself.&nbsp; She was
self center cunt. She would never think twice about anyone because she didn&rsquo;t give a shit.&nbsp; Now, she cares, why? Because a girl broke the one thing she only had; heart.
&nbsp;
B walks around in the apartment trying to think.&nbsp; She sat down on a couch.&nbsp; The wound is deep and the pain is torture.&nbsp; She looks at the sharp kitchen knives; there is one, a knife that can cut through anything.&nbsp; She looks at them and studies them.&nbsp; She could use the knife to curve out the deep wound in her heart.&nbsp; She wanted to do it, but she was a coward.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Damn, damn, damn,&rdquo; all that come out of B mouth, but no feeling or knowledge of the words, only nothing.
&nbsp;
The wound is so deep, that to cure it, she needs to be a hollow &ndash; a person that is nothing.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
******************************************************************
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yaa, Yeah, Yaa, Yaa,&rdquo; the moans of sexual torture B made.&nbsp; She was in sexual heaven and hell all at the same time.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, god...&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; B said over and over again in a sexually charged tortured love song.&nbsp; This would be the tenth time she has cum and the women were not planning on stopping.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The torture made her feel human &ndash; pain of life, the joy of sex and the fear of no control, all at the same time.&nbsp; She enjoys that feeling more than having an orgy.
&nbsp;
She couldn&rsquo;t move and was powerless, in her own bedroom.&nbsp; She was blindfolded and tied to her own rod iron bed, each limb tied to a single post; suspended above the mattress. This bed frame had been custom made just for this purpose.&nbsp; Each post of her been was specially designed so that a rope could be tied securely even against the struggles brought on by her sexual play.
&nbsp;
So there she was suspended above her own mattress with one woman sucking and lapping at the delicate folds of her pussy while alternately sucking her clit, while the other wiped her with leather riding wipe. You could hear &nbsp;the force of the blows to her skin, with each crack of the wipe she was brought closer to orgasm. With each passing moment and each blow the flesh of her body would rise in an angry red line. B didn&rsquo;t feel the leather against her skin because to her, it felt like a sensual tongue licking and teasing her most sensitive of body parts.
&nbsp;
She cried out in a tortured sexual bliss.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, Ohh, Ohhh, Fuck, Ohhh&rdquo;, B cried out, not wanting these twisted felling of ecstasy to stop.&nbsp; She was cuming, the juices from her hot pussy where dribble out creating an ever growing puddle in the bed below. The intensity of the pain brought on by the torture and the pleasure that she had been longing for this whole week was at its peak, and she was about to make her pussy into a fountain.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh Fuck, Ohh, Ohh&hellip; (ring&hellip; ring&hellip;) What the fuck!,&rdquo; &nbsp;B said as a generic sounding ring tone emanated from the cell phone in a chair off in the corner of the room began to play without any warning.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come on, don&rsquo;t fucking stop!&nbsp; Come on!&rdquo; B yelled.
&nbsp;
The women continued, but the phone continued as well.
B was doing her best to block out the sound and to concentrate on her own self fulfillment, but the phone never stop, like a bad song stuck in your head.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stop, just stop, I mean stop. I&rsquo;m serious. Get me down,&rdquo; B said and then cursed under her breath.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The two women untied her as quickly as they could and B took off the blindfold.
&nbsp;
She got up from her bed in a huff and walked over to her chair.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought, I put this thing on silence, damn, this better be good,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
The women didn&rsquo;t make a sound, as they were order to apply torture, but never to speak.
&nbsp;
B dialed the phone number with her face red with angry, but worry, wondering if someone had died in a plane or car crash, murdered or something dreadful. If not, she was going to kill the person who made her stop her multiple orgasms with no reason.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;What,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, thank god you picked up.&nbsp; I have been calling and calling&hellip;&rdquo;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;About what&hellip;, Judy,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cindy. You know&hellip;,&rdquo; Judy said.
&nbsp;
B wanted to put her hands through the phone and choke the living daylights out of Judy.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;What about Cindy? This better be good.&nbsp; I swear, it better be good,&rdquo; B said in a very annoyed sounding voice.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, honey, she called me and &hellip;,&rdquo; Judy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;So what&hellip; You want a fuckin prize,&rdquo; B said with a bit of disdain in her voice.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;No... Honey.&nbsp; She should be knocking on your door soon.&nbsp; Now, remember your anger management,&rdquo; Judy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shut up.&nbsp; What the hell?&rdquo; Beatrice asked.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;She wanted to have sex with the famous hoe of the valley,&rdquo; Judy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, I would rather have sex with a toothless, smelly old woman on skid row in the middle of street, then Cindy, while I&rsquo;m sober,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell her that. I&rsquo;m just warning you. See you have a rep,&rdquo; Judy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Please. See you tomorrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll handle this,&rdquo; B said as a knock came from the front door.
&nbsp;
B puts the phone down and walks over to the front door naked with not even so much as a tissue cover her shapely form.&nbsp; She opened the door, wide open so that the world at large could admire her toned, shapely, mocha colored body. She was proud of it and went to the gym everyday to keep it.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
B stood there framed by the door way in front of Cindy with a body that looked like it was shaped by the sculpture of ancient Rome. Her Legs where long and shapely, her pussy hairless still dripping wet with cum, she had perky breast that flowed down to rock hard abs, her arms were toned with a superb definition, and her face was one God molded himself to perfection.&nbsp; Her short red hair made her look like a young girl with a woman&rsquo;s body.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want to fuck you,&rdquo; Cindy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Too bad, I have nothing for you,&rdquo; B said as she crossed her arms.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know you want it.&nbsp; I can give it to you.&nbsp; Look at you, I see you were playing with yourself,&rdquo; Cindy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why would you say that,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;You left the club alone,&rdquo; Cindy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I had an appointment,&rdquo; B turns her head in the apartment, &ldquo;Girls, come here.&rdquo;
&nbsp;
The women walk over to B and stand in front of Cindy, both on either side of her.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Cindy&rsquo;s eyes showed a bit of surprise and sadness all at the same time, this just as a man was walking his dog only to almost trip and fell.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know you like what you see old man,&rdquo; B said and the man continued to walk pass her door with an obvious hard on in his pants.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;So, do I look like I&rsquo;m lonely?&rdquo; B asked.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a slut,&rdquo; Cindy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a hoe.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a big difference,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;You going to catch something,&rdquo; Cindy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;And to think, you wanted to sleep with me. I&rsquo;m the hoe, remember.&nbsp; I sleep around.&nbsp; I have a rep. Did you think, it was fake? I have pleasured and been pleasured. I&rsquo;m just that good.&nbsp; Look, even you want a piece of me.&nbsp; But because I&rsquo;m with two women and just had multiple orgasms, I&rsquo;m a slut.&nbsp; Bitch please.&nbsp; Now, go before I kick your ass down stairs. I&rsquo;m trying to be nice, Good Bye&hellip;&rdquo; B said, closing the door and locking it.
&nbsp;
B looked at the women in front of her and said, &ldquo;So.&rdquo;
&nbsp;
One woman got down on her knees and started licking B&rsquo;s still dripping pussy and the other stood from behind massaging her breasts.
&nbsp;
B was in ecstasy again and her juices started to flow but only slightly.
&nbsp;
The touching and the licking only made her feel like this was work. Normal and not very exciting, more like something you do to past the time away in a long meeting.
&nbsp;
She looked down at her stomach and saw the raised red welts across her stomach, she smiled.&nbsp; It reminded her that she could be hurt, she had feeling those of a human, not some arrogant goddess she made herself to be.
&nbsp;
After B had her fill of the women and her sexual urges satisfied, the women had their bragging rights and left for the evening.&nbsp; The taste of B was like honey and sweet cream; a flavor so perfect one would crave the taste. The juices made a person&rsquo;s mouth water for days and made you want more, so much so it would make you do anything just to taste that perfectly sweet combination of paradise in your mouth again.
&nbsp;
Being with the Queen Bitch B, had its perks, but you had to be willing to throw your morals in the trash and be trash in the process.
&nbsp;
Little did they know, but B had secrets; she never opened up or trusted anyone.&nbsp; If you thought about it, there must have been a reasons why a street smart with a Masters in English, taught at a local college, who was a screen writer and novelist would want to wear an electric dog collar around her neck, want her body to be in pain due to blunt objects and whips leaving behind bruises, cuts and marks, make her wrist bleed and to be powerless in her own condo twice a month.&nbsp; If only her friends knew; she was sick and troubled, they would have locked her away a long time ago and threw away the key.&nbsp; She would have been forgotten and all her accomplishments would have been a joke.
&nbsp;
Why would a person put themselves through torture and pain, to make themselves feel alive? &nbsp;To make them understand fear.&nbsp; To make them understand pain. To make them understand their own existence in the world.&nbsp; B called this therapy; but a normal person would call it madness.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Since B was born into New York City high society, she never knew the meaning of failure or fear.&nbsp; Those two words never entered her mind and never came out of her mouth.&nbsp; She was born to succeed at any cost.&nbsp; She was driven, a goddess in her own mind that she even worshiped herself.&nbsp; But, lonely B had secrets that only she knew and forgot about and no one knew, until she failed for the first time in her life. This unlikely incident made her face her fear dead without the security of her whips and the chains.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s she is, the little hoe,&rdquo; Lisa said as the tired squealed, B walked into the restaurant.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
B had on one of her exclusive custom made hats, sunglasses to block out the killer rays of sun and the normal lighting in the restaurant, a tee shirt and jeans, with one of her coach bags and matching sneakers.&nbsp; She looked like a black trash version of Paris Hilton.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
She looked to the table and sat down.&nbsp; As always at Sunday brunch the women would stop chatting and there would be silence. She would snap her fingers and the waitress or waiter will place a fresh pot of coffee on the table in front of her, without saying a word. She would lift up her glasses to see the server and would than order her regular breakfast. After the Sunday brunch ritual that her friends knew so well, she would pour the coffee and they would stare at her.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cindy, she called me last night. You had marks on your body,&rdquo; Lisa said as the women studied her.
&nbsp;
B looked at all of them as if they were delinquent kids with disciplinary problems. She looked at each one of them, with her thick glasses on, took a breath and shrugged.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you being abused?&rdquo; Karen asked.
&nbsp;
B rolled her eyes and said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do relationships. Sometimes the fuck gets rough.&rdquo;
&nbsp;
Tracy looked at her in disgust, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand why you, an intelligent black woman can&rsquo;t grow up?&rdquo;
&nbsp;
B looked at her and took off her glasses.&nbsp; The lights from the ceiling almost blinded her, as if she was locked in a dark cave for days.&nbsp; She continued to blink and rub her eyes to get her focus and then looked at Tracy.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, is this black thing?&nbsp; Yes, I&rsquo;m black. I know.&nbsp; I look at myself in the mirror everyday.&nbsp; One thing is, I&rsquo;ll never grow up. I&rsquo;m like the female peter pan, but sexy. I love my life and I bet I get more sex then you guys anyway.&nbsp; By the way, if I&rsquo;m such I child, why did you try to date me? So, do you need to grow up too,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
There was as dead silence as the waitress delivers B&rsquo;s food.&nbsp; It was one pancake, one slice of french toast and one egg sunny side up with cheese. The chef made this meal just for her; the meal was called Queen B.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Listen, the way you are going, you&rsquo;ll be alone, what will you do when you can&rsquo;t do your threesomes, quads, orgies, one night stands and all your other things that I don&rsquo;t even what to think about.&nbsp; You know, meaningful relationships that last a long time,&rdquo; Jovanee said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what I want, I&rsquo;ll marry an Asian,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can take things seriously,&rdquo; Lisa said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Life shouldn&rsquo;t be serious.&nbsp; Life should be fun and exciting.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t find that in a long-term relationship only in a quick fuck. Liz, you understand,&rdquo; Beatrice said.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The group of women looked at the thin long straight black haired Latina in a nice pressed white collared shirt. She could feel their eyes piecing and stabbing every inch of her body. It was as if they were looking into her very soul.&nbsp; They wanted the truth from Liz, since she did pass her hoe crown to Miss B.
&nbsp;
Liz looked at them and toke a deep breath, &ldquo;B is right&hellip;,&rdquo; with a long pause, &ldquo;she also wrong.&rdquo;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; B asked.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;A quick fix is exciting, but knowing you will be awaking up to the same person for years is a powerful experience,&rdquo; Liz said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Until, they leave your ass,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shut up, QB.&nbsp; I gave her everything, but she still had a thing for the opposite sex.&nbsp; But, I did learn a lot from her, like how to maintain a long-term relationship,&rdquo; Liz said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;You two would still be together, if you were a man.&nbsp; Come on, I love my life. I love how I live.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you just accept that?&nbsp; I feel comfortable in my own skin and practice safe sex, ok.&nbsp; God...&nbsp; I love feeling young, like my college days,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not in college,&rdquo; Tracy said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, I am. Remember, I teach class at ASU. So, I&rsquo;m in college. Tracy, age is just a state of mind, not a reminder of old bones or shit like that.&nbsp; When I die, I will die happy,&rdquo; B said and continued to eat and drink.
&nbsp;
All the women at the table knew what type of woman B was.&nbsp; Liz, was the only one that got close to her, but knew she was hiding something.&nbsp;&nbsp; Liz, slept with her once and heard B talking in her sleep, she seemed to be talking to her parents, but when she questioned B about it she simple dismissed it as a regular dream.&nbsp; For a while, Liz and B had a bit of a contest going.&nbsp; It was to see how many women &nbsp;they could sleep with in a month. Since B, doesn&rsquo;t the meaning of failure, she won.&nbsp; Since then, they have been rivals, but remained friends.&nbsp; B had to thank Liz because the contest made her reputation grow in the valley of the sun.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The remainder of the brunch focused on the gay pride events that were coming up next weekend and what if any plans they had. The women wanted to go as a group to show their gay pride; which B wasn&rsquo;t interested in.&nbsp; The only way she showed her pride was having sex with women and turning straight women gay.&nbsp; She felt that she was the gay ambassador for the straight and gay world.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
No one knew why B was a bitch and proud of it.&nbsp; Liz was the only one that knew B was a tormented soul that needed to be help and loved; even though she was accomplished in her field.&nbsp; Liz could only see the glimpse of the goodness B had.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Like the time when Liz was kicked out of their house because her girlfriend of 8 years decided she wanted to move her boyfriend in. B got Liz an apartment and paid the move in cost, gave her some money for food and furniture and was a big support for her.&nbsp; Liz will never forget what B did, but she always wondered why B was the way she was.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
On the outside it all about the sex romps, bad attitude this was all just superficial, but inside Liz knew there was pain and sadness, but didn&rsquo;t know why or what.&nbsp; Only if she knew, she could help Queen B.
&nbsp;
After brunch, the women paid for their meals, said their goodbyes and left.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
B walked outside the restaurant and put on her sunglasses.&nbsp; She looked like a young butch girl with a fashion sense. She opened her bag and took out a long thin cigarette. She placed it in her mouth as if she was making a fashion statement, but she never lit it.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
B looked around her surrounding as if she was in another world; in another time.&nbsp; The restaurant, the stores and streets all changed as the seconds of time ticked away, she could feel her world turning in front of her eyes.&nbsp; She wanted to cry, wanted to laugh, but she didn&rsquo;t want to remember.&nbsp; The memories felt as if salt was being thrown on open wounds; which she tries to stitch up everyday. She felt so alone, confuse and hurt.&nbsp; She hated life. Life wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be so cruel to her, but it was.&nbsp; She looked up at the sky and cursed God. I didn&rsquo;t give a fuck, if it was a man or woman.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t give a damn.
&nbsp;
She walked passed her red BMW and walked out of the parking lot.&nbsp; She stepped on the sidewalk and walked North.&nbsp; As she walked, she lit her cigarette and started to smoke.&nbsp; She continued to walk and walk, as if she was on a mission to get somewhere fast, but not really knowing where to go.
&nbsp;
B crosses the street and step on the sidewalk, where she stopped dead in her &nbsp;tracks.&nbsp; She looked around and everything, the trees, grass, buildings, light poles and even the sidewalks disappeared.&nbsp; It was isolated deserted, wild land there was no civilization in sight except for one house.&nbsp; She walked up and stood in front of the house. She stared at the house as if it were a statue.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The air was dusty, the sun was hot and the land was dry and cracked. It was a desert wilderness, with only one house.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
B knew about the house well.&nbsp; It was brown sandstone colored stucco finished house, with a distinctly southwestern look, the house had what looked like a half made attempt at a porch. The windows were sad and the house looked depress, like it needed crank or even meth to make it alive and energized.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
She had her last drag of the cigarette and drops it on the sidewalk.&nbsp; Studying the house took her back to her younger rebellious days.&nbsp; The days when she was out of control, a fighter, when knowledge was power and the time was of love and passion.&nbsp; Love and passion, she wanted that again.&nbsp; She yearned for it.&nbsp; She was even willing to die, just to have the Love and the Passion back again. A time when the level of passion reached heights, where her orgasms felt so intense it was as if a thousand tiny needles were piercing he every square inch of body, each one no causing pain but pleasure. It was a com so great, it will forever be written in the history never to be repeated again.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The mere thought of it made her weak in the knees and she just wanted God to grant her that same pleasure again; she longed for it.&nbsp; For the gift of passion would make her change her life, be more compassionate and her good side would come out, but when she opened her eyes, the dream was gone and the house looked sadder than ever, like it would do anything to be demolished.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
In that moment, B knew what real love was. She had it and felt it, but sometimes good things ends, but the memories are still the same.&nbsp; She only had her memories and she would cherish them in her heart and soul, like a cornerstone to her being.&nbsp; Life was happy then, now it&rsquo;s miserable.&nbsp; One reason, to fuck away the pain.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
B saw a stone near her feet and picked it up.&nbsp; She throws it at the house as if she was in her younger years and ran back to her car.&nbsp; The streets, cars, lights, and other buildings started to appear again, but she looked like she had not aged since high school. She pressed the cars button and pulled into street with a bit of a squeal and drove away, as if she was being chased by the police.&nbsp; She raced to her house and cried about the death sentence the house had placed on her.
&nbsp;
B parked the car and ran into her condo. She was done for &nbsp;the day and life was already done with her.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
During night, as she tossed and turned, the nightmares were coming back to light.&nbsp; Everything that she buried in her soul, the wounds they were coming to the surface and the wounds started to sting and she was unmovable.&nbsp; She needed the pain to be dead.
&nbsp;
She awoke in a cold sweat.&nbsp; Her nightmare became reality again and this time she was going to end it.&nbsp; She wanted to end her torture and she was preparing for this moment.&nbsp; All the torture sessions she paid for was going to pay off.&nbsp; She had no fear, she felt no physical pain, and she wanted the ultimate orgasm so she could die with a smile on her face.&nbsp; She was ready.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
She walked into her closet. On the top shelf was a black box with a knife in it.&nbsp; She had been planning this for years.&nbsp; As she opened the box, all her emotions came to life as if she was living in it again. In the box was a red velvet bag was a sharp knife that had never been used.&nbsp; Her legs went limp and she slid down the wall.&nbsp; She was ready.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
She slid the knife across her wrist slowly to feel the intensity and sensual feeling of the blade slowly opening her skin like cutting soft butter. The pain made her cum and the wetness began to puddle beneath her. It was heaven. When she was done, the sexual arousal lingered like the last rays of the sun trying hard to stay in the sky. She didn&rsquo;t want to feeling to end.&nbsp; She did the other wrist and cum multiple times once again. It was the best sex she had ever had; she was smiling ear &nbsp;to ear.&nbsp; There was no pain, only pleasure and climax.&nbsp; The knife dropped. She sat there in ecstasy, with her eye close.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; a woman voice asked.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hello, what the hell are you doing, you look like shit?&rdquo; the voice said again.
&nbsp;
With a hard slap to the face, B woke up.&nbsp; She was in a place with no balance, just floating with a woman looking at her.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sharon?&rdquo; B asked.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;What the fuck are you doing?&rdquo; Sharon asked.
&nbsp;
Beatrice blushed and smiled when Sharon talked to her, but Sharon slapped her again. &ldquo;What the hell?&rdquo;&nbsp; Sharon asked.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I missed you. I want to be with you.&nbsp; I need you,&rdquo; B said as the blood was gushing out of her wrists.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know, but you need to move on.&nbsp; You will always have me. I&rsquo;m always there. I have been helping you, idiot.&nbsp; I have given you good women and you treated them like trash. Why?&rdquo; Sharon asked.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not you,&rdquo; B said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course not, but babe, I&rsquo;m dead. You can&rsquo;t have me,&rdquo; Sharon said.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Sharon sat next to B and B put her head in Sharon&rsquo;s breast. B soaked up her smile, energy, spirit, smell and taste. She was whole again, not hollow.&nbsp; She was alive, not a zombie. She was finally at peace.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;Babe, you need to live, for me. Please do. I&rsquo;m begging you too. Don&rsquo;t die because of me. I&rsquo;m not worth it.&nbsp; I was a coward and stupid.&nbsp; I should have relied on you. I should have told you everything, but I didn&rsquo;t and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not with you. I&rsquo;m a coward. You were always the strong one. &nbsp;Babe, my parents cut me off and I thought I had no one, but I forgot; I had you.&nbsp; You need to survive and be strong,&rdquo; Sharon said.
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want to be with you,&rdquo; B said with an ounce of breath.
&ldquo;Babe, it&rsquo;s not you time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not asking to forget about me, but remember you have a life.&nbsp; Live it.&nbsp; You will find one soon.&nbsp; Promise me you will live your life the way you always wanted and I&rsquo;ll always be there, watching and helping.&nbsp; I love you.&nbsp; I will always love you. You promise never to do this again?&rdquo; Sharon asked.
&nbsp;
B looked at her lover and cried, &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo;
&nbsp;
Sharon put her hand in her chest and pulls out a piece of her heart. Sharon put the piece in B&rsquo;s chest.&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will always be with you.&nbsp; Now, live,&rdquo; Sharon said.
&nbsp;
With a breath, B opens her eyes slowly. She was in a white room and tubes were in her arm. There were bandages on her wrists.
&nbsp;
In a weakness state, she looked around. She saw Liz by her side.&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re awake.&nbsp; Thank god, I had a key to your apartment.&nbsp; You fool.&nbsp; You tried to kill yourself.&nbsp; If you would have died, who would be the Queen Hoe?&nbsp; I passed the crown to you remember.&nbsp; Plus, honey,&rdquo; Liz said as she stared into B&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;I care so much about you.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;d died, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do.&rdquo;
&nbsp;
Liz leans over to B and kissed her gently on the lips as if she was fragile piece of priceless glass. B looked at her and smiled. Liz leans over again and gave B a long passionate kiss. B closed her eyes and thought about what Sharon said.
&nbsp;
B needed to live her life and in the future, she will be joined with Sharon at the end.&nbsp; Soon, she will not be hollow anymore.

			<title>Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher's Anti-Sex Slavery</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">By Hollie McKay</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Demi Moore, husband Ashton Kutcher and their self-titled the Demi and Ashton Foundation (DNA), which seeks to combat the sexual exploitation and slavery of minors, have come under fire this week over a campaign many consider to be inappropriately light and fluffy given the severity of the issue.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The Hollywood power couple enlisted an array of their A and B-list friends (including Sean Penn, Jessica Biel, Eva Longoria and Justin Timberlake) for a public service campaign which consists of several short videos featuring the slogan &ldquo;Real Men Don&rsquo;t Buy Girls.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In one spot, Sean Penn proves that &ldquo;real men know how to use an iron,&rdquo; by ironing his sandwich before eating it. Justin Timberlake exemplifies that &ldquo;real men know how to shave&rdquo; by taking to his facial hair with an electric chainsaw. Bradley Cooper shows that &ldquo;real men know how to make a meal&rdquo; by pouring milk into a cereal box and eating it with a giant spoon. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Not everyone is amused.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;This is what happens when celebrities do an issue divorced from the movement. Once you chose an issue and don&rsquo;t do it in collaboration with people who have been doing this for a long time, this is what you end up with," Norma Ramos, Executive Director of the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women told FOX411.com. "There is a general dumbing down that is going on and this is an example of dumbing down a social justice movement with the narrowest message possible.&rdquo; </span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/2n5jazoLQrM?rel=0" width="560" height="349"></iframe> </span><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Ramos said the ads are also completely ineffective. &ldquo;Those men who are buying girls and children are pedophiles; they&rsquo;re not going to be swayed by that campaign," she said. "They have got to have a campaign which is &lsquo;real men don&rsquo;t buy sex.&rsquo; You have to sacrifice wanting to be cool for wanting to be effective.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In another spot, Jamie Foxx shows that &ldquo;real men know how to use a remote control&rdquo; by using the device to open his beer bottle while happily engaged in an episode of Donald Trump&rsquo;s &ldquo;Celebrity Apprentice.&rdquo; Ramos said the casting here was particularly inappropriate. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lPBM4gU1zh4?rel=0" width="560" height="349"></iframe> </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;Donald Trump is CEO of a beauty pageant which simply fosters reducing women to sex objects. Once you reduce a human being to a thing they become disposable and putting him in this category of people,&rdquo; Ramos continued. &ldquo;I would have chosen the men a little more carefully.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Furthermore, Los Angeles-based psychologist Dr. Nancy Irwin, who predominantly works with sex offenders and their victims, concurred that while Moore and Kutcher&rsquo;s hearts are in the right place, the execution of the videos was simply wrong.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/S7nsB7TFWls?rel=0" width="560" height="349"></iframe> </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;The ads are not addressing the issue; they are veering off in another direction in a &lsquo;gender joke&rsquo; attempt. With the enormous amount of heart and creativity available in both Moore and Kutcher, it would be preferable and a stronger message for the public to present male models of healthy sexuality with respect for women,&rdquo; Irwin said. &ldquo;Taking on traditional female activities such as knitting, ironing or cooking does not make a man. The answer to abuse of females is not to make men more like women.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Matthew Vadum of the Capital Research Center in Washington D.C also said that he feels the campaign only worsened the reputation of celebrities trying to do good.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;It&rsquo;s even more difficult than usual to take celebrities seriously when they put out flippant ads like this. Justin Timberlake shaving with a chainsaw? What exactly is the message here? There is a huge difference between &lsquo;funny&rsquo; and foolishness,&rdquo; he said.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Reps for Kutcher and Moore did not respond for comment. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> However, Allison Trowbridge of the anti-slavery Not For Sale Campaign said that in spite of suspect campaign, their involvement has a positive impact.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;Such viral buzz can be a true catalyst for individuals to engage and take action against modern-day slavery,&rdquo; she said.&rdquo;Not only do celebrity voices generate mass attention around the issue, but more importantly, they affect the cultural shift necessary to address the demand for this thriving criminal enterprise.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> And campaign controversy aside, Kutcher and Moore are certainly passionate about drawing awareness to the subject of sex trafficking.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;I was seized by a feeling of wanting to find the guy who is raping a 7-year-old girl and just beat the (expletive) out of him, really take his guts out.

			<title>Does the Bible Matter In the 21st Century?</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/does-the-bible-matter-in-the-21st-century-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">By Vishal Mangalwadi</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Published April 13, 2011 | FoxNews.com</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In his quest to change oppressive regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, President George W. Bush argued, &ldquo;Everyone desires freedom.&rdquo; True. Everyone also desires a happy marriage: can everyone therefore have one?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Afghanistan, Iraq, Ivory Coast, and Libya ought to teach secular ideologues that freedom does not flow from the barrel of a gun. Nor does it flourish in every culture.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Why do most American presidents place a hand on the Bible to take the oath of office? Secular education has made that a meaningless tradition, but the tradition exists because the Bible is the secret of America&rsquo;s freedom. Forget the Bible and America will go the way of the first Protestant nation &ndash; Nazi Germany.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Plato saw Greek democracy first hand and condemned it as the worst of all political systems. That&rsquo;s why the spread of the Greek culture, called "Hellenization," did not stir a struggle for democracy. In AD 798, the English scholar Alcuin summed up the then European wisdom to Emperor Charlemagne: &ldquo;And those people should not be listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God, since the riotousness of the crowd is always very close to madness.&rdquo; Indeed, the voice of a corrupt people is often the devil&rsquo;s voice.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The cancer at the heart of America&rsquo;s political economy is cultural. This great nation was built by an ethic &ndash; a spirituality that taught citizens to work, earn, save, invest, and use their wealth to serve their neighbors. This biblical ethic has been replaced by secularism&rsquo;s entitlement culture that teaches people that they have a right to this, that and the other without corresponding obligations to work, save, and serve. This new culture forces the state to take from productive citizens or borrow from other nations and spend it on man-made rights. This corruption of character is destroying the world&rsquo;s greatest economy, but can democracy allow leaders to go against the voters&rsquo; voice?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The people&rsquo;s voice began to be honored as God&rsquo;s voice only because the sixteenth century biblical Reformation began saturating the hearts and minds of the people with the Word of God. Those who prayed, &ldquo;Your kingdom come, your will be done in Scotland (or England, or Holland)&rdquo; found the grace to free themselves from the tyranny of men.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[By Vishal Mangalwadi Published April 13, 2011 | FoxNews.com In his quest to change oppressive regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq, President George W. Bush argued, &ldquo;Everyone desires freedom.&rdquo; True. Everyone also desires a happy marriage: can everyone therefore have one? Afghanistan, Iraq, Ivory Coast, and Libya ought to teach secular ideologues that freedom does not flow from the barrel of a gun. Nor does it flourish in every culture. Why do most American presidents place a hand on the Bible to take the oath of office? Secular education has made that a meaningless tradition, but the tradition exists because the Bible is the secret of America&rsquo;s freedom. Forget the Bible and America will go the way of the first Protestant nation &ndash; Nazi Germany. Plato saw Greek democracy first hand and condemned it as the worst of all political systems. That&rsquo;s why the spread of the Greek culture, called "Hellenization," did not stir a struggle for democracy. In AD 798, the English scholar Alcuin summed up the then European wisdom to Emperor Charlemagne: &ldquo;And those people should not be listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God, since the riotousness of the crowd is always very close to madness.&rdquo; Indeed, the voice of a corrupt people is often the devil&rsquo;s voice. The cancer at the heart of America&rsquo;s political economy is cultural. This great nation was built by an ethic &ndash; a spirituality that taught citizens to work, earn, save, invest, and use their wealth to serve their neighbors. This biblical ethic has been replaced by secularism&rsquo;s entitlement culture that teaches people that they have a right to this, that and the other without corresponding obligations to work, save, and serve. This new culture forces the state to take from productive citizens or borrow from other nations and spend it on man-made rights. This corruption of character is destroying the world&rsquo;s greatest economy, but can democracy allow leaders to go against the voters&rsquo; voice? The people&rsquo;s voice began to be honored as God&rsquo;s voice only because the sixteenth century biblical Reformation began saturating the hearts and minds of the people with the Word of God. Those who prayed, &ldquo;Your kingdom come, your will be done in Scotland (or England, or Holland)&rdquo; found the grace to free themselves from the tyranny of men. Not just Islamic, but every culture that rejects the kingdom of God condemns itself to be ruled exclusively by sinful men. Almost everyone desires a happy marriage, but without the Bible, America cannot even define, let alone sustain marriage as one man&ndash;one woman, exclusive, and life-long relationship. The West became great because biblical monogamy harnessed sexual energy to build strong families, women, children, and men.  Human history knows no force other than the Bible that has the capacity to dam sexual energy to build powerful families and nations. Indeed, no non-biblical culture has ever been able to require husbands to &ldquo;love your wives&rdquo; and give them the spiritual resources to do so.

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">By Aliya Leigh</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">What are the qualifications to get the <strong>GLBT membership card</strong>?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some women asks me this question a lot, but the wording is different.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Like the GLBT club is a secret society and by holding this membership card, the street are paved with gold, the body turns into Jade and Diamonds, your eyes become stars, you become a God on earth and people will worship you. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">With this membership card, you get the VIP treatment; the world can offer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You are a giant and no one, not even the law can touch you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You are unstoppable, untouchable; even the Mexican Mafia will tremble at your feet and lick the crack of your ass. People will care for your needs and lick your feet to clean them. You are the most powerful person on Earth, even Jehovah God trembles at your feet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">First, I am going to throw out GLBT and officially change it to Queer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Queer is easy and covers a lot of ground.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I got a call from a young woman who wanted to get a Queer membership card. She asked me so many questions about being a Lesbian, sex toys, threesomes, clubs and what type of girls I am into.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Now, I&rsquo;m not going to lie, I love blonde and blue eyes women because they look unique, but I also love a strong woman with brains, common sense, wisdom and has a wonderful beautiful soul.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am dating a woman like that now and I will never trade her for a blonde.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">But, this young woman who I was talking to on the phone, asked me the most personal questions of my life. I wanted to hang up, but I needed her to see my point of view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Why?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">This was the reason; I wanted her to understand about what it&rsquo;s like being a true Lesbian.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But, what is a true Lesbian? Great question.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is what I am tried of</span>:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Women who are pissed off with men and believe women will treat them better</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Women who have seen &ldquo;The L Word&rdquo; too many times</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Women who believe, if you go Queer you will become wealthy</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Women who believe that most Lesbians always have threesomes</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Women who believe that sex is better with a woman than a man</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Women who are lonely and need a body to hug</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Women who think, being a Lesbian is the new trend or new fashion statement</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Women who believe Lesbians are freaks in the bedroom</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Unfortunately, the Queer community doesn&rsquo;t have a certain skin color, height, weight, look, sound or anything like that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>To be in the Queer community, it&rsquo;s based on if you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Queer&rdquo;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I can&rsquo;t say actions because there are some Queers who are in the closet, they in the shadows of life and that&rsquo;s their choice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">The only way, you can tell when someone is Queer, is by Queer Radar; you just know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It can be a touch, a feeling or a look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You just know when you are around your own kind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Queers and Straights have been trying to figure out the Queer Radar and they can&rsquo;t understand it; it&rsquo;s just a simple feeling.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">This is a list of qualifications to belong to the Queer club; <strong>which I don&rsquo;t agree with</strong>:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Have you had a same-sex relationship</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Have you slept with someone of the same-sex</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Do you go to Queer Pride</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Do you go to Queer clubs</span></li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Are you an activist in the Queer community</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">These questions are so stupid, they make me vomit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I knew I was Queer when I was 5 years old, but had sex at age 25.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I do go to Queer clubs, Queer Pride and I&rsquo;m active in the Queer community, but I should not get a Queer membership card just for that.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Being Queer is not a question; it&rsquo;s what you are as a person.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you have to question your sexuality and don&rsquo;t know if you are Queer, then you are not Queer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Some straight women will cry, yell and scream over the fact, I told them, &ldquo;You are NOT Queer.&rdquo; This doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the end of the world for you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You are straight and you need to be proud to be straight.&rdquo;&nbsp;Does that make sense?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Being Queer is a hard life in mainstream society. Queers don&rsquo;t have the same rights as Straight people do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">It seems to me, people who are forcing themselves to be Queer are just looking for acceptance in the world or something is missing in their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I am hear to tell you, if you need to be around people, get out and do something. It&rsquo;s common sense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You don&rsquo;t have to force yourself to Queer because if you do, you will make yourself look more foolish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">For example, I knew a Lesbian, I will name Tina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Tina and I became friends and I introduced her to my friends. No, I was not dating her. I just wanted to have a close friend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">One night, I was with Tina and my friends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Tina asked this, &ldquo;Why do you guys dislike men?&rdquo;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I looked at her to see if she was serious and she was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">She asked another question, &ldquo;You guys don&rsquo;t like penises?&rdquo; I looked at her again.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I couldn&rsquo;t believe the questions coming out of her mouth. How can you be a Lesbian and asks questions like that? I was stunned and my friends had question marks orbiting their heads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Found out, Tina was not a Lesbian. She had been watching too much of &ldquo;The L Word&rdquo;. The main reason why, I hate that show!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Lesbians do love men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s just in our make-up not to have sex with men; not because we believe men are a walking disease.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">I love having sex with women, not because I had some bad dick, a man slapped the shit out of me or I was sexually abused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I love men as brothers and friends, not as sexual objects. There are so many hot hot hot looking men, I know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I see them, I look at them and wonder what they will look like nude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I see the visual in my head, I am sexually turned off.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">There are no qualifications to get a Queer Membership card. Just be yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If you are not Queer, you are not Queer. I can&rsquo;t explain it. You are what you are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">This is my life, I don&rsquo;t think of Queer being a trend, a fashion statement, rebellion against </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>America</st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: small;"> or a sex freak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It is what it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You can&rsquo;t force something you are not. If you do, you will hate yourself and that hate will transfer to others. You will be alone and no one will care.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">So be yourself!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Be proud to be you!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Don&rsquo;t change for no one. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Having a Queer membership in the mainstream world is like being in a small animal cage, starving for food and love.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">It&rsquo;s not all fun and games.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;"><span style="font-size: small;">All Queers don&rsquo;t sit around the house with friends drinking wine all day</span></li>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[By Aliya Leigh

What are the qualifications to get the GLBT membership card?&nbsp; Some women asks me this question a lot, but the wording is different.
Like the GLBT club is a secret society and by holding this membership card, the street are paved with gold, the body turns into Jade and Diamonds, your eyes become stars, you become a God on earth and people will worship you. &nbsp;&nbsp;
With this membership card, you get the VIP treatment; the world can offer.&nbsp; You are a giant and no one, not even the law can touch you.&nbsp; You are unstoppable, untouchable; even the Mexican Mafia will tremble at your feet and lick the crack of your ass. People will care for your needs and lick your feet to clean them. You are the most powerful person on Earth, even Jehovah God trembles at your feet.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
First, I am going to throw out GLBT and officially change it to Queer.&nbsp; Queer is easy and covers a lot of ground.
I got a call from a young woman who wanted to get a Queer membership card. She asked me so many questions about being a Lesbian, sex toys, threesomes, clubs and what type of girls I am into.&nbsp; Now, I&rsquo;m not going to lie, I love blonde and blue eyes women because they look unique, but I also love a strong woman with brains, common sense, wisdom and has a wonderful beautiful soul.&nbsp; I am dating a woman like that now and I will never trade her for a blonde.
But, this young woman who I was talking to on the phone, asked me the most personal questions of my life. I wanted to hang up, but I needed her to see my point of view.&nbsp; Why?
This was the reason; I wanted her to understand about what it&rsquo;s like being a true Lesbian.&nbsp; But, what is a true Lesbian? Great question.&nbsp; 

This is what I am tried of:
&nbsp;

Women who are pissed off with men and believe women will treat them better
Women who have seen &ldquo;The L Word&rdquo; too many times
Women who believe, if you go Queer you will become wealthy
Women who believe that most Lesbians always have threesomes
Women who believe that sex is better with a woman than a man
Women who are lonely and need a body to hug
Women who think, being a Lesbian is the new trend or new fashion statement
Women who believe Lesbians are freaks in the bedroom

&nbsp;
Unfortunately, the Queer community doesn&rsquo;t have a certain skin color, height, weight, look, sound or anything like that.&nbsp; To be in the Queer community, it&rsquo;s based on if you say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Queer&rdquo;.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say actions because there are some Queers who are in the closet, they in the shadows of life and that&rsquo;s their choice.
The only way, you can tell when someone is Queer, is by Queer Radar; you just know.&nbsp; It can be a touch, a feeling or a look.&nbsp; You just know when you are around your own kind.&nbsp; Queers and Straights have been trying to figure out the Queer Radar and they can&rsquo;t understand it; it&rsquo;s just a simple feeling.
This is a list of qualifications to belong to the Queer club; which I don&rsquo;t agree with:
&nbsp;

Have you had a same-sex relationship
Have you slept with someone of the same-sex
Do you go to Queer Pride
Do you go to Queer clubs
Are you an activist in the Queer community

&nbsp;
These questions are so stupid, they make me vomit.&nbsp; I knew I was Queer when I was 5 years old, but had sex at age 25.&nbsp; I do go to Queer clubs, Queer Pride and I&rsquo;m active in the Queer community, but I should not get a Queer membership card just for that.
Being Queer is not a question; it&rsquo;s what you are as a person.&nbsp; If you have to question your sexuality and don&rsquo;t know if you are Queer, then you are not Queer.&nbsp;
Some straight women will cry, yell and scream over the fact, I told them, &ldquo;You are NOT Queer.&rdquo; This doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s the end of the world for you.&nbsp; You are straight and you need to be proud to be straight.&rdquo;&nbsp;Does that make sense?

This is my life, I don&rsquo;t think of Queer being a trend, a fashion statement, rebellion against America or a sex freak.&nbsp; It is what it is.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t force something you are not. If you do, you will hate yourself and that hate will transfer to others. You will be alone and no one will care.&nbsp;
So be yourself!&nbsp; Be proud to be you!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t change for no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;
Having a Queer membership in the mainstream world is like being in a small animal cage, starving for food and love.
It&rsquo;s not all fun and games.&nbsp;

All Queers don&rsquo;t sit around the house with friends drinking wine all day
All Queers don&rsquo;t always have shopping sprees; everyday
All Queers are not wealthy
All Queers don&rsquo;t have multiple sex partners
All Queers don&rsquo;t run around town half nude
Some Queers can&rsquo;t stand each other
Some Queers don&rsquo;t go to the clubs
All Queers don&rsquo;t get discounts on food, clothing and other stuff

Queers are people, are just like everyone else.&nbsp; We get sick, died, poor, wealthy, have hardships, poor health, bad sex, breakups and make-ups, eat, sleep and shop.&nbsp;
To me, Queers are like Vampires.&nbsp; We can be anyone. We are in groups and we love the taste of flesh. And we believe, we will always be fabulous and never die.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]]></itunes:subtitle>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">By Aliya Leigh</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">&ldquo;I HATE THIS!!!!&rdquo;, as I screamed at the top of my lungs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">I met this typical lesbian couple who I never want to meet again.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I rather be straight then to be among their circles.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Again, I don&rsquo;t like dick so, I&rsquo;ll be a nun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>No, scratch that, I can&rsquo;t be a nun &ndash; don&rsquo;t believe in the Pope, so forget that, nonsense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>About the Pope, how can I follow a man who&rsquo;s a drag queen, loves the entertainment of little boys dressed up as innocent angles in his bedroom, and believes gay people should go to hell?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Pope is dead in my eyes and God should strike him down as he lust over an innocent boy who doesn&rsquo;t have the grass and the balls haven&rsquo;t dropped.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">This lesbian couple believes that the GLBT community should be held to higher standards. But, what are higher standards?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is what I don&rsquo;t get and will never get; lesbians and gays trying to be so high and mighty, but at the same time sucking cock and pussy as if it&rsquo;s a rich delight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>GLBT standards will always be low in the Straight man&rsquo;s eyes, so why the judgment?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">When we tell the straight man that we are gay - all the good service we have done, the money, the power and how we conduct ourselves - goes out the window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When Gay is mention, straight people think this &ldquo;gays are the most disgusting people on the face of the earth&rdquo;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>So, why the judgment?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">I was speaking to this couple. The thin, small, snobbish, short hair cut woman who I&rsquo;ll called, &ldquo;The Judge&rdquo;, was talking about how gays need to be held to a higher standard and have superb role models to look up to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>She mention about how, the GLBT community is mostly all about sex and that&rsquo;s it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Her partner, who called &ldquo;The Jury&rdquo;, agreed with her like a loyal slave looking to get a doggy biscuit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Thing is, GLBT is about sex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Just like the Black Community is mostly about slavery and the color of skin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The White Community is mostly about the color of skin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The Latin Community is mostly about skin and immigration.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">GLBT is about sex, because it&rsquo;s all about whom you love, not your skin color.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>If all GLBT people came out of the womb as Rainbow Bright, then it will be about the color of our skin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>But, The GLBT is the only ethic race whose color blind, so we need something to identify ourselves and that is sex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">But, how can a person judge another?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This is what straight people do to the garbage of the earth.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Judge!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What I can&rsquo;t understand, how two pussy loving lesbians can be on a high pestle and talk about high standards in the GLBT, when you don&rsquo;t know what high standards are?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Do straight people have high standards?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I don&rsquo;t know, but let&rsquo;s look.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have reality TV shows like the &ldquo;Jersey Shore&rdquo;, &ldquo;Celeb Rehab&rdquo;, &ldquo;Real World&rdquo;, &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; and others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You have media personalities like, Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton, Linsday Lohan, Donald Trump and others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The world straight world idolizes these people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They only got famous because people follow them aka fans.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">What are high standards for straight people? I have been to swinger clubs before and most of the swingers are church going, high standards, wealthy, Republicans who love to have multiple sex partners for a weekend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>High standards?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>These are the same people during the week that will tell you, how they love God, believe in being ultra-conservative and with judge a person based on their looks and actions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On the weekends, the same bible ultra-conservative Republicans who experiment with every sex act unknown to men.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">The GLBT community is a community about being accepted for who and what you are. It&rsquo;s a community for the people who can&rsquo;t fit in a category of this world we live in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We are like the garbage of the world - waste management.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">I was born and raised in a good family with two parents and a brother.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was raised to love God and respect people who only believe in the basics on the bible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I was raised to be a judge to judge the disgusting people in this world with hand of God himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>When I think back, who the HELL was I to tell people what to do and how to act? Now, I am the garbage who I once condemn to live in hell and torment called AIDS.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">But, what are high standards?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Please, someone show me this book called High Standards <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>and I will like to speak to the person who wrote it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">In my mind, there is no such thing as high standards. I believe that there is a thing called RESPECT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It&rsquo;s such a little word with so much meaning. If we could just respect one another, maybe we will have a better world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">When you take that position, in judging people basis on there thinking and actions, you are telling God, &ldquo;Yo Dude, you don&rsquo;t know what the hell you are doing, so I&rsquo;m going to take your job.&rdquo; I have found, when we take on the job of God, we make ourselves look foolish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Yes, I am a Republican and a proud one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I love God, read the bible and go to church.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I embrace God everyday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I try to set good morals in my life and follow the golden rule, &ldquo;Love one another.&rdquo; But, when I say, I am gay &ndash; that loving God, going to church and following the golden rule goes out the window into the unknown air of nothing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>All people will see is, &ldquo;That girl sucks pussy.&rdquo;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">It&rsquo;s so amazing, that when I met a woman whose straight, I don&rsquo;t think about how she&rsquo;s performs in the bedroom, if she sucks dick or what sex positions she enjoys.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It doesn&rsquo;t enter my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>What enters my mind is her character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">In all, we need to expect each other like brothers and sisters, especially in our GLBT community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We need respect for each other feelings and opinions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We may not love everyone in our community, but respect is the key.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We can be as high and might as we want to be, but when we leave our GLBT home and walk out in Straight Land, we are garbage who don&rsquo;t have rights and get stared at as if we are a walking disease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: small;">Will the GLBT community will be welcome into StraightLand?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Reprogram the minds of every living being on earth &ndash; GLBT, Straight, Animals and every cell life on the earth. But, we can&rsquo;t reprogram the whole world, so all we can do, is respect people and love people like they are family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Listen to other people and understand people&rsquo;s point of view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>High standards are a myth and there is no such thing, but rambles of a man who&rsquo;s afraid what he might find in his closet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[What Are High Standards?
By Aliya Leigh
&ldquo;I HATE THIS!!!!&rdquo;, as I screamed at the top of my lungs.
I met this typical lesbian couple who I never want to meet again.&nbsp; I rather be straight then to be among their circles.&nbsp; Again, I don&rsquo;t like dick so, I&rsquo;ll be a nun.&nbsp; No, scratch that, I can&rsquo;t be a nun &ndash; don&rsquo;t believe in the Pope, so forget that, nonsense.&nbsp; About the Pope, how can I follow a man who&rsquo;s a drag queen, loves the entertainment of little boys dressed up as innocent angles in his bedroom, and believes gay people should go to hell?&nbsp; The Pope is dead in my eyes and God should strike him down as he lust over an innocent boy who doesn&rsquo;t have the grass and the balls haven&rsquo;t dropped.
This lesbian couple believes that the GLBT community should be held to higher standards. But, what are higher standards?&nbsp; This is what I don&rsquo;t get and will never get; lesbians and gays trying to be so high and mighty, but at the same time sucking cock and pussy as if it&rsquo;s a rich delight.&nbsp; GLBT standards will always be low in the Straight man&rsquo;s eyes, so why the judgment?&nbsp;
When we tell the straight man that we are gay - all the good service we have done, the money, the power and how we conduct ourselves - goes out the window.&nbsp; When Gay is mention, straight people think this &ldquo;gays are the most disgusting people on the face of the earth&rdquo;.&nbsp; So, why the judgment?
I was speaking to this couple. The thin, small, snobbish, short hair cut woman who I&rsquo;ll called, &ldquo;The Judge&rdquo;, was talking about how gays need to be held to a higher standard and have superb role models to look up to.&nbsp; She mention about how, the GLBT community is mostly all about sex and that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; Her partner, who called &ldquo;The Jury&rdquo;, agreed with her like a loyal slave looking to get a doggy biscuit.&nbsp;
Thing is, GLBT is about sex.&nbsp; Just like the Black Community is mostly about slavery and the color of skin.&nbsp; The White Community is mostly about the color of skin.&nbsp; The Latin Community is mostly about skin and immigration.
GLBT is about sex, because it&rsquo;s all about whom you love, not your skin color.&nbsp; If all GLBT people came out of the womb as Rainbow Bright, then it will be about the color of our skin.&nbsp; But, The GLBT is the only ethic race whose color blind, so we need something to identify ourselves and that is sex.&nbsp;
But, how can a person judge another?&nbsp; This is what straight people do to the garbage of the earth.&nbsp; Judge!&nbsp; What I can&rsquo;t understand, how two pussy loving lesbians can be on a high pestle and talk about high standards in the GLBT, when you don&rsquo;t know what high standards are?
Do straight people have high standards?&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know, but let&rsquo;s look.&nbsp; You have reality TV shows like the &ldquo;Jersey Shore&rdquo;, &ldquo;Celeb Rehab&rdquo;, &ldquo;Real World&rdquo;, &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; and others.&nbsp; You have media personalities like, Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton, Linsday Lohan, Donald Trump and others.&nbsp; The world straight world idolizes these people.&nbsp; They only got famous because people follow them aka fans.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[If you want to be a household name in households other than your own, there are ways to draw attention and make a name for yourself.




Step 1:&nbsp;Make a video

Film yourself singing, acting foolish, or playing air guitar to get famous. Put the video on YouTube, create a website and go viral, joining every social network you can.








Check out the Most Viewed videos to get ideas. Talent is less important than being different.








Step 2:&nbsp;Be a comedian

Tell jokes and perform at every open mic event in town. Write constantly and condition yourself to either ignore the hecklers and dead rooms, or else prepare scathing counter attacks that may become your comic persona.








Step 3:&nbsp;Be famous being famous

Attend high-profile clubs and behave distastefully enough to make people know you &mdash; if not like you &mdash; and get photographed everywhere with drug-addled rock stars. Expose yourself as a fraud, and enter rehab. For imagining yourself famous, you will be famous.








Step 4:&nbsp;Marry a film star

Marry a Hollywood film star and have babies with them, then cheat on them to get ink in the scandal pages. Opt for a reality show about cheating people, after which you can write a book abut being misunderstood.








Step 5:&nbsp;Talk on radio

Get your own radio show on the AM band during which you offend everyone you can with outrageous, erratic, and irrational commentary on culture, politics, and morals. You won&rsquo;t need an education, scruples, or purpose in most cases.








Step 6:&nbsp;Try modeling

Arrange for a headshot and register with a local agency to get representation. Take modeling lessons to become a supermodel. Get surgery, add celebrity hair, face lifts, liposuction, and whatever implants and camera angles enhance the image.








Start as an extra on films and get noticed. Network with stars, agents, and producers to build up to speaking lines on camera.








Step 7:&nbsp;Set world records

Set a world record for a ridiculous stunt. People always notice, so make sure to spread the word.








Step 8:&nbsp;Succeed in business

Succeed in business, make millions, and become a public speaker, lecturing on the motivational circuit or doing infomercials. Sell tapes and books detailing your secrets. Enjoy it before your 15 minutes of fame run out!








In 2010, adult film star Stormy Daniels considered running for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana against an incumbent whose phone number was found in the &ldquo;little black book&rdquo; of a prostitute.

			<title>A new Marijuana State University </title>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="copy">
<p>A man from Maine is starting his own Marijuana State University where he plans to teach the audience the proper way to grow pot.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/04/07/marijuana-state-university-unveiled-maine/?test=latestnews" target="new">Fox News</a>, 56-year-old Ray Logan said he made the course to help people learn how to use marijuana after an injury. Logan acquired his medical marijuana card in 2010, many years after his spinal injury during a skydiving accident in 1996.</p>
<p>Logan held his first class at a hotel in Portland on April 2. About 15 people showed where they discussed ideal growing conditions.</p>
<p>The classes also include information on the history of marijuana, details on various strains and instructions on how to grow marijuana using hydroponics, a method of growing plants using mineral solutions without water.</p>
<p>Logan said marijuana isn't an easy plant to grow. His classes are open to anyone over the age of 21. The classes aim to instruct medical marijuana users, not any other reasons. Although, those who don't have a medical license are still welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Police in Auburn, Maine, where Logan plans to hold his next class on May 7, told FoxNews.com that as long as attendees do not bring their latest cannabis creations to the class, there won't likely be any problems.</p>
<p>The marijuana classes do not allow participants to use real drugs or drug paraphernalia. Logan is not a licensed dispensary, and said he uses basil plants as an example in his classes.</p>

Gary Gates has an idea but acknowledges pinpointing a solid figure remains an elusive task.</p>
<p style="border-color: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; font-family: arial, verdana; font-size: 13px; outline-style: none; outline-width: 0px; line-height: 17px; background-position: 0px 0px; background-repeat: repeat repeat; border-width: 0px; border-style: none; padding: 0px;">Gates is demographer-in-residence at the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy, a think tank based at the University of California, Los Angeles. For the institute's 10th anniversary this week, he took a scholarly stab at answering the question that has been debated, avoided, parsed and proven both insoluble and political since pioneering sex researcher Alfred Kinsey said in the 1940s that 10 percent of the men he surveyed were "predominantly homosexual."</p>

&nbsp;
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - How many gay men and lesbians are there in the United States? Gary Gates has an idea but acknowledges pinpointing a solid figure remains an elusive task.
Gates is demographer-in-residence at the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy, a think tank based at the University of California, Los Angeles. For the institute's 10th anniversary this week, he took a scholarly stab at answering the question that has been debated, avoided, parsed and proven both insoluble and political since pioneering sex researcher Alfred Kinsey said in the 1940s that 10 percent of the men he surveyed were "predominantly homosexual."
Gates' best estimate, derived from five studies that have asked subjects about their sexual orientation, is that the nation has about 4 million adults who identify as being gay or lesbian, representing 1.7 percent of the 18-and-over population.
That's a much lower figure than the 3 to 5 percent that has been the conventional wisdom in the last two decades, based on other isolated studies and attempts to discredit Kinsey.
One reason, according to Gates, is that until recently, few surveys tried to differentiate respondents who identified as gay or lesbian from those who sometimes engaged in homosexual acts or were attracted to people of the same sex. All were lumped into the gay category.
"One of the major questions, when you think about how many (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people are there, is what do you mean by LGBT?" he said. "This shows there are pretty big differences between people who use the terms to label themselves versus sexual behavior or attraction."
Gates found, for example, that another 1.8 percent of the adult population, or a little more than 4 million Americans, identifies as bisexual, according to his research brief published Thursday by the Williams Institute.
He also estimated that 19 million people, or 8.2 percent of the population, have engaged in sex with a partner of the same sex. That includes all groups, such as gays, bisexuals and heterosexuals who have experimented with same-sex behavior.
Another two studies, conducted by state agencies in California and Massachusetts, yielded what Gates thinks is the first credible estimate of the nation's transgender population. He puts it at about 700,000 adults, or 0.3 percent of the population.
Gates is the first to admit his figures are imprecise.
But because so few national population surveys have asked about sexual orientation and the ones that have were not conducted consistently over time, the data on which to base a firm conclusion does not exist, he said.
"Yes, this is a credible estimate, but I'm fine to have a debate with someone about whether I'm right or wrong," he said. "The academic side of me says everything comes with caveats. But there is a level of power associated with having a number that can move dialogues along and hopefully move things forward."
Government agencies and private researchers have been reluctant in the past to include questions about sexual orientation and gender identity in their surveys, deciding the issue was not worthy of inquiry or assuming participants would be reluctant to answer honestly.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Life is crazy. Life is wonderful. Life is strange.
Life is like a 4-way highway, people coming and going through your life.
Some are wreaks, some are easy, some are complicated, some are fast, some are slow and some just want to enjoy the ride.
But, in all life is a beautiful, strange and easy car wreck, then appreciate the reason for your stay.
Why are you here? I don't know.
Enjoy the ride!
Be kind.
Be free.
Be yourself.
Life is life and whatever comes your way, it's up to you if you will welcome the challenge or be on the sidelines of your own adventure.
So, be life and live.
Don't be in limbo or part of the living dead.&nbsp;
Live life. Take the ride. You owe it to yourself to do so.
First, close your eyes; take a deep breath and take the first step.
Love,&nbsp;
Aliya Leigh

You can release some steam at work in several ways without </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;">saying something you&rsquo;ll regret later.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Step 1: Take breaks</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Go for a drive, wander in the park, or browse the local bookstore at lunch.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Step 2: Stretch in the office</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> If you have your own office, stop everything, lie on the floor, and stretch, relax, or practice deep breathing exercises.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Step 3: Clean up</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Clean your desk and reorganize your workspace. Expending energy by standing up and moving around might get your mind off irritating situations, and having a clean, organized workspace will calm you down.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Step 4: Listen to music</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Listen to music to soothe your emotions. If your company doesn&rsquo;t aloud headphones at work, go out to your car and listen to music in the parking lot on your break. Music releases endorphins and recharges you.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Step 5: Joke around</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Take a break. Talk to coworkers at the coffee machine or while waiting for a meeting to start. Tell a joke or story to cheer a coworker, which will have the same effect on you. Laughter in the workplace promotes creativity and strengthens relationships.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Step 6: Talk to a loved one</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Really burned up? Step outside and give a family member or friend a call to vent your frustrations.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[ PHOENIX -- Arizona's medical marijuana law takes effect within days, and employers are figuring out how to deal with workers who are medical pot users. Modern Industries in Tempe, which manufactures products for the semiconductor and aerospace industries, is looking at its policies. "The law is very specific in that companies do not have to chance their policy to allow anyone to be under the influence," said Human Resources Director Tony Abraham. "Certainly, in a manufacturing facility, we want to be careful that people are not under the influence while they're doing their job or working any of the machinery back there because they could get hurt." Abraham said there will be more pressure on supervisors to recognize when their workers might be impaired. "This is going to put a little more onus on the supervisors to be aware of their employees -- how they're acting, how they're performing, whether there's a chance from one day to the next in their demeanor, in their behavior." Abraham said workers at Modern Industries deal with acid and other dangerous substances which requires they be alert and focused. "The bottom line is going to be taking care of the employee, making sure their needs are met, but also keeping them and our other employees safe." Leathers Milligan &amp; Associates is a human resources consulting firm. Jack Milligan isn't worried that he'll encounter a medical marijuana problem in his small company, but he is concerned about how his company will advise its larger clients. "They (clients) have to think about their policies, about their approaches to this," Milligan said.

			<title>Marriage Advice - Aliya Leigh</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/marriage-advice-aliya-leigh]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">I spoke to my cousin last night. Wait, I mean, I chatted with her on facebook. &nbsp;I forgot no one uses the phone anymore. What is a phone? &nbsp;A phone is a dumb piece of equipment that is used for status and dull entertainment. &nbsp;I hate my phone. I can only use it for, reading a book, finding out the status of my twitter trends, playing games, texting and reading the news. I can't use my phone to call because it doesn't work. &nbsp;So what is the purpose of paying T-Mobile 75 dollars a month for unlimited calling, texting and data? What is the point, when you can't even use the phone to make calls? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">So anyways, I was chatting with my cousin who is a natural Blonde. She does give blondes a bad rap. She's like the stereotypical blonde; dumb, big boobs and lots of fun. &nbsp;She is a half and half, you know mixed race, like half Black and half White. &nbsp;But she is no Hallie Berry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">She asked me if I am dating. I told her, "No", but I am. &nbsp;Why No? She still thinks I am straight. &nbsp;I never told her the news that I am gay. It is much easier to let her believe I am straight. Why? &nbsp;Because then, I have to go into detail and scientific data why I am gay and the gene pool which I came from. Again, she is a typical blonde. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">I told her, I am not dating because I don't believe in marriage. As my cousin, she knows this. From a child, I never believed in marriage. I came from a home with a mother and father, who are still together. But at what cost? &nbsp;My mother is a witch and my father is a nice man. &nbsp;My brother and I wanted my father to marry a nice and kind woman, but his heart was and still is with my mother. I think, my father is into S&amp;M. &nbsp;And the my mother is my birth mother. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">When I look back on there marriage, it can make me vomit. &nbsp;If this was an example of marriage, I don't want any part of it. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">My blonde hair cousin lives in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Florida</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;"> and only loves Black people. She hates White people and wish for their death. She believes White people are the enemy of this world. Her father is white (German and Irish) and her mother is Black. She loves both of her parents, even her White father. &nbsp;Again, the girl is not bright. &nbsp;As a family, she's our entertainment. We laugh before she opens her mouth. &nbsp;So, anyways, she started to date the Black guy in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Florida</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;"> because it seemed that he was the ONLY Black man in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Florida</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>You think so, after all the crap he put her through during their 3 relationship, and still didn&rsquo;t get laid. I told her that there were make Black men in </span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">Florida</span><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black;">, but she didn&rsquo;t and still don&rsquo;t believe me. She believes that, she needs to be with a pure African Black man in order to be accepted in the Black race. Again, she&rsquo;s my cousin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>I hate to tell her the bad news, &ldquo;There are no pure, pure people in the world today&rdquo;. You will think, she knows this, since she is mixed herself. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Most of my family including myself are mixed. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">So, we were talking about this marriage thing. &nbsp;She needs to get married, so she can lose her virginity. My family is old school. So, when she asked me about marriage and I just told her that I don't believe in it; she believes I am still a virgin; which is far from the truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">I can honestly say I have slept with 45 to 50 women in my short sexual life. &nbsp;I had to make up for lost time and I don't have any STDs. &nbsp;Am I proud that I slept with a lot of women? No. &nbsp;It's what it is. I was going through some stuff in my life and trying to deal with life, love, sex and God. &nbsp;I figured if God made me into a strange nasty disgusting creature, I should have all my fun and then die. &nbsp;Now, I have a different outlook on life. &nbsp;I do. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">One person asked me, (since I'm a Young Adult writer) if I'm a good role model for teenage girls? Due to my lesbianism and sexual acts. &nbsp;I told them and I am tell you, I am not a role model. But, if teenage girl want to look up to me, then let them. I tell the truth about my life and give teenage girls my bad and good examples. I listen, I feel and learn from my fan base. I love them and they love me. If I am their role model, I hope they can learn from my mistakes. Mothers forget to be role models for their daughters, so Brit, Paris, Lindsay and Snooki become a role model to them instead. &nbsp;I believe, I'm better then Brit, Paris, Lindsay and fat crack head Snooki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">Anyways, we were talking about marriage. I read an article about an unhappy marriage. &nbsp;To think about it, what is an unhappy marriage? I have learned and felt that the unhappy marriage articles and advice is BS. &nbsp;No one can tell you how to feel or what should do in your life. &nbsp;When people focus on stupid an article about the bad signs of a marriage or of dating, they tend to mess up their own marriage with laws that should never be introduced. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">Each relationship is different and one should not judge how you should act or feel. &nbsp;The only advice I have for a happy relationship is communication, loyalty and honesty. If we followed these three words in our hearts, we will create a better world. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">So to me, marriage and relationship advice is BS and brunch of nonsense. Why would you give permission to a person who you never met, to tell you want to do? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; color: black; font-size: small;">But, when you follow an article about advice or read a self-help book, you are being the stupid sheep who's following a leader who's full of BS.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: small;">I have been dealing with my sexuality all of my life, since I came from an </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> ultra-religious family. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In my present life, I have come to terms that I am a lesbian and </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I proud to be who I am. As a woman told me, I am a Professional Lesbian. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Most of my life, I have tried to hide the fact of who I am. Since I came </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> out of the closet, my life has been enriched with friends, lovers, </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> self-worth, self-esteem and love for my neighbors. I love being who </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I am and proud of it. I always wonder if straight people are proud </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> to be straight. Who knows? I should ask a straight person. I wonder </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> what they will say.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Homosexuality is the person, but unfortunately people only think </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> of the act or the bedroom scene, so funny, because you don&rsquo;t need </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> a bedroom to have sex. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>For me, I had sex:</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In front of a crowd</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In a pool at a friend&rsquo;s house</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In the bedroom of my house</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In a movie theatre room of a person&rsquo;s house</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In the movie theatre</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In a hot tub </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In a car (A Honda FIT) (if you&rsquo;re fan of my podcast, you will know this)</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In a office </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * Online </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In a club&rsquo;s bathroom (Most of my one-night stands)</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * In a parking lot</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> * Outside</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">See, the GLBT community is just like the straight community. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> THE ONLY DIFFERNCE IS: we love the same sex.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> That's it!! So why is a concern for most people? I don&rsquo;t get it. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> But, some comments can be hurtful. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> For example, on twitter, a guy told me, that if he raped me, </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I can be straight. WHAT? So getting raped by a straight man will </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> cure my gayness? So killing a gay man will cure his gayness?</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> And now, you are telling me, Homosexuality is a disease?</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> How can Homosexuality be a disease? </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Disease:</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ndash;noun</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> 1. a disordered or incorrectly functioning organ, part, structure,</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> or system of the body resulting from the effect of genetic </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> ordevelopmental errors, infection, poisons, nutritional deficiencyor </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> imbalance, toxicity, or unfavorable environmental factors;illness; </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> sickness; ailment.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> 2. any abnormal condition in a plant that interferes with its </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> vitalphysiological processes, caused by pathogenicmicroorganisms, </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> parasites, unfavorable environmental,genetic, or nutritional factors, etc.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> 3. any harmful, depraved, or morbid condition, as of the mind </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> oversociety: His fascination with executions is a disease.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> 4. decomposition of a material under special circumstances: tindisease.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ndash;verb (used with object)</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> 5. to affect with disease; make ill.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <em>---- http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/disease</em></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> If the dictionary is correct, Homosexuality is not a disease. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>Lifestyle:</strong></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ndash;noun</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> the habits, attitudes, tastes, moral standards, economic level,</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> etc., that together constitute the mode of living of an individual </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> or group.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <em>---- http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lifestyle</em></span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> So homosexuality is not a disease or lifestyle. It&rsquo;s just who I am. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> For me, if homosexuality is a lifestyle, give me week and I will be </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> straight. I was a vegan for a month and then I smelt a WhiteCastle </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> hamburger. The vegan lifestyle was gone with one bite.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The world always put Church, God, The bible and Gayness in one pile of </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> nonsense. Now, I love the bible and I believe the bible is inspired by </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Jehovah God himself. He allowed some men to write down his thoughts in a </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> book called The Bible. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>In The Bible, Jesus states the two greatest commands:</strong> </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> 1) Love your God with all your heart, even if your God is L. Ron Hubbard</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> or Luke Skywalker. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> 2) Love your neighbor as yourself.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> So if we love God and love our neighbor, why do we have so many </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> conflicts in Christian societies? I don&rsquo;t get it. The cruelest people </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> who hurt our social structure are in Christian countries. I love God and </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I go to church every Sunday. I read the bible to gain more understand of</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> God&rsquo;s viewpoint on matters and read examples on how God dealt with a </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> situation. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> God is a God of love and understand. Look at King David and his undying </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> love for Jonathan. In the bible, King David loved Jonathan more then a woman. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> King David also committed murder, allowed his daughter to be raped by her </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> brother and did a lot of wrong doing, but God loved King David. God loved </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> King David so much that Jesus (God&rsquo;s Son) was born in King David&rsquo;s family line. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The point I am making is we as a society needs to stop the hate because it&rsquo;s </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> so stupid; protesting for Prop 8, Yes to Marriage and so on and so on. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Why should it matter who I slept and spend my time with? Why do people care? </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> My feelings is, straight people may have very very boring lives, so they </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> to hate the gays so they can have meaning in their lives. Too wordy. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In a nutshell, some straight people are bored out of their minds and</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> need a release from the bore. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> On my Face book page, a friend posted a link about the GLBT community </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> in Uganda. Uganda is so Christian, that if Jesus Christ stays in Uganda </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> for a while, I bet they will kill him because he is not being Christian </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> enough. I do believe Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Savior, started </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Christianity, right? You know, sometimes I am slow. </span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Please view the videos. It&rsquo;s amazing how Christians can treat another. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> If Christianity is filled with so much hate, why is God called the God of Love?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> <strong>http://www.sexualminoritiesuganda.org</strong> </span><br /><br /> <br /><br /></p>

			<title>The Bible’s surprisingly mixed messages on sexuality</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/the-bible-s-surprisingly-mixed-messages-on-sexuality]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="font-size: small;">By Robert A. J. Gagnon</span></strong><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In her recent CNN Belief Blog post &ldquo;The Bible&rsquo;s surprisingly mixed messages on </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> sexuality,&rdquo; Jennifer Wright Knust claims that Christians can&rsquo;t appeal to the Bible</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> to justify opposition to homosexual practice because the Bible provides no clear </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> witness on the subject and is too flawed to serve as a moral guide.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> As a scholar who has written books and articles on the Bible and homosexual practice, </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> I can say that the reality is the opposite of her claim. It&rsquo;s shocking that in her </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> editorial and even her book, "Unprotected Texts," Knust ignores a mountain of evidence </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> against her positions.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> It raises a serious question: does the Left read significant works that disagree </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> with pro-gay interpretations of Scripture and choose to simply ignore them?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Owing to space limitations I will focus on her two key arguments: the ideal of </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> gender-neutral humanity and slavery arguments.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Knust's lead argument is that sexual differentiation in Genesis, Jesus and Paul </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> is nothing more than an "afterthought" because "God's original intention for </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> humanity was androgyny."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> It&rsquo;s true that Genesis presents the first human (Hebrew adam, from adamah,</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> ground: &ldquo;earthling&rdquo;) as originally sexually undifferentiated. But what Knust </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> misses is that once something is &ldquo;taken from&rdquo; the human to form a woman, the </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> human, now differentiated as a man, finds his sexual other half in that missing</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> element, a woman.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> That&rsquo;s why Genesis speaks of the woman as a &ldquo;counterpart&rdquo; or &ldquo;complement,&rdquo; </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> using a Hebrew expression neged, which means both &ldquo;corresponding to&rdquo; and </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;opposite.&rdquo; She is similar as regards humanity but different in terms of </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> gender. If sexual relations are to be had, they are to be had with a sexual </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> counterpart or complement.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Knust cites the apostle Paul&rsquo;s remark about &ldquo;no &lsquo;male and female&rsquo;&rdquo; in Galatians. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Yet Paul applies this dictum to establishing the equal worth of men and women </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> before God, not to eliminating a male-female prerequisite for sex.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Applied to sexual relations, the phrase means &ldquo;no sex,&rdquo; not &ldquo;acceptance of </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> homosexual practice,&rdquo; as is evident both from the consensus of the earliest </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> interpreters of this phrase and from Jesus' own sayings about marriage in </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> this age and the next.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> All the earliest interpreters agreed that "no 'male and female,'" applied </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> to sexual relations, meant "no sex."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> That included Paul and the ascetic believers at Corinth in the mid-first </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> century; and the church fathers and gnostics of the second to fourth centuries.</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Where they disagreed is over whether to postpone mandatory celibacy until the </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> resurrection (the orthodox view) or to begin insisting on it now (the heretical view).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Jesus&rsquo; view</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> According to Jesus, &ldquo;when (people) rise from the dead, they neither marry nor </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> are given in marriage but are like the angels&rdquo; (Mark 12:25). Sexual relations </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> and differentiation had only penultimate significance. The unmediated access </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> to God that resurrection bodies bring would make sex look dull by comparison.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> At the same time Jesus regarded the male-female paradigm as essential if sexual </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> relations were to be had in this present age.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In rejecting a revolving door of divorce-and-remarriage and, implicitly, </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> polygamy Jesus cited Genesis: &ldquo;From the beginning of creation, &lsquo;male and </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> female he made them.&rsquo; &lsquo;For this reason a man &hellip;will be joined to his woman </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> and the two shall become one flesh&rsquo;&rdquo; (Mark 10:2-12; Matthew 19:3-12).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Jesus&rsquo; point was that God&rsquo;s limiting of persons in a sexual union to two is </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> evident in his creation of two (and only two) primary sexes: male and female, </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> man and woman. The union of male and female completes the sexual spectrum, </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> rendering a third partner both unnecessary and undesirable.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The sectarian Jewish group known as the Essenes similarly rejected polygamy on the</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> grounds that God made us &ldquo;male and female,&rdquo; two sexual complements designed for a </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> union consisting only of two.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Knust insinuates that Jesus wouldn&rsquo;t have opposed homosexual relationships. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Yet Jesus&rsquo; interpretation of Genesis demonstrates that he regarded a male-female </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> prerequisite for marriage as the foundation on which other sexual standards </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> could be predicated, including monogamy. Obviously the foundation is more </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> important than anything predicated on it.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Jesus developed a principle of interpretation that Knust ignores: God&rsquo;s </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> &ldquo;from the beginning&rdquo; creation of &ldquo;male and female&rdquo; trumps some sexual </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> behaviors permitted in the Old Testament. So there&rsquo;s nothing unorthodox </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> about recognizing change in Scripture&rsquo;s sexual ethics. But note the </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> direction of the change: toward less sexual license and greater conformity </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> to the logic of the male-female requirement in Genesis. Knust is traveling </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> in the opposite direction.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Knust&rsquo;s slavery analogy and avoidance of closer analogies</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Knust argues that an appeal to the Bible for opposing homosexual practice </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> is as morally unjustifiable as pre-Civil War appeals to the Bible for </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> supporting slavery. The analogy is a bad one.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The best analogy will be the comparison that shares the most points of </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> substantive correspondence with the item being compared. How much does the </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Bible&rsquo;s treatment of slavery resemble its treatment of homosexual practice? </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Very little.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Scripture shows no vested interest in preserving the institution of slavery </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> but it does show a strong vested interest from Genesis to Revelation in </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> preserving a male-female prerequisite. Unlike its treatment of the institution </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> of slavery, Scripture treats a male-female prerequisite for sex as a pre-Fall </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> structure.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The Bible accommodates to social systems where sometimes the only alternative </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> to starvation is enslavement. But it clearly shows a critical edge by specifying </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> mandatory release dates and the right of kinship buyback; requiring that </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Israelites not be treated as slaves; and reminding Israelites that God had </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> redeemed them from slavery in Egypt.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Paul urged enslaved believers to use an opportunity for freedom to maximize</span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> service to God and encouraged a Christian master (Philemon) to free his slave </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> (Onesimus).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> How can changing up on the Bible&rsquo;s male-female prerequisite for sex be </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> analogous to the church&rsquo;s revision of the slavery issue if the Bible encourages </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> critique of slavery but discourages critique of a male-female paradigm for sex?</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Much closer analogies to the Bible&rsquo;s rejection of homosexual practice are the </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Bible&rsquo;s rejection of incest and the New Testament&rsquo;s rejection of </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> polyamory (polygamy).</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Homosexual practice, incest, and polyamory are all (1) forms of sexual behavior </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> (2) able to be conducted as adult-committed relationships but </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> (3) strongly proscribed because (4) they violate creation structures </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> or natural law.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Like same-sex intercourse, incest is sex between persons too much </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> structurally alike, here as regards kinship rather than gender. </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Polyamory is a violation of the foundational &ldquo;twoness&rdquo; of the sexes.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> The fact that Knust chooses a distant analogue (slavery) over more </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> proximate analogues (incest, polyamory) shows that her analogical </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> reasoning is driven more by ideological biases than by fair use of </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> analogies.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> Knust&rsquo;s other arguments are riddled with holes.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> In claiming that David and Jonathan had a homosexual relationship she </span><br /><span style="font-size: small;"> confuses kinship affection with erotic love.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[By Robert A. J. Gagnon In her recent CNN Belief Blog post &ldquo;The Bible&rsquo;s surprisingly mixed messages on  sexuality,&rdquo; Jennifer Wright Knust claims that Christians can&rsquo;t appeal to the Bible to justify opposition to homosexual practice because the Bible provides no clear  witness on the subject and is too flawed to serve as a moral guide. As a scholar who has written books and articles on the Bible and homosexual practice,  I can say that the reality is the opposite of her claim. It&rsquo;s shocking that in her  editorial and even her book, "Unprotected Texts," Knust ignores a mountain of evidence  against her positions. It raises a serious question: does the Left read significant works that disagree  with pro-gay interpretations of Scripture and choose to simply ignore them? Owing to space limitations I will focus on her two key arguments: the ideal of  gender-neutral humanity and slavery arguments. Knust's lead argument is that sexual differentiation in Genesis, Jesus and Paul  is nothing more than an "afterthought" because "God's original intention for  humanity was androgyny." It&rsquo;s true that Genesis presents the first human (Hebrew adam, from adamah, ground: &ldquo;earthling&rdquo;) as originally sexually undifferentiated. But what Knust  misses is that once something is &ldquo;taken from&rdquo; the human to form a woman, the  human, now differentiated as a man, finds his sexual other half in that missing element, a woman. That&rsquo;s why Genesis speaks of the woman as a &ldquo;counterpart&rdquo; or &ldquo;complement,&rdquo;  using a Hebrew expression neged, which means both &ldquo;corresponding to&rdquo; and  &ldquo;opposite.&rdquo; She is similar as regards humanity but different in terms of  gender. If sexual relations are to be had, they are to be had with a sexual  counterpart or complement. Knust cites the apostle Paul&rsquo;s remark about &ldquo;no &lsquo;male and female&rsquo;&rdquo; in Galatians.  Yet Paul applies this dictum to establishing the equal worth of men and women  before God, not to eliminating a male-female prerequisite for sex. Applied to sexual relations, the phrase means &ldquo;no sex,&rdquo; not &ldquo;acceptance of  homosexual practice,&rdquo; as is evident both from the consensus of the earliest  interpreters of this phrase and from Jesus' own sayings about marriage in  this age and the next. All the earliest interpreters agreed that "no 'male and female,'" applied  to sexual relations, meant "no sex." That included Paul and the ascetic believers at Corinth in the mid-first  century; and the church fathers and gnostics of the second to fourth centuries. Where they disagreed is over whether to postpone mandatory celibacy until the  resurrection (the orthodox view) or to begin insisting on it now (the heretical view). Jesus&rsquo; view According to Jesus, &ldquo;when (people) rise from the dead, they neither marry nor  are given in marriage but are like the angels&rdquo; (Mark 12:25). Sexual relations  and differentiation had only penultimate significance. The unmediated access  to God that resurrection bodies bring would make sex look dull by comparison. At the same time Jesus regarded the male-female paradigm as essential if sexual  relations were to be had in this present age. In rejecting a revolving door of divorce-and-remarriage and, implicitly,  polygamy Jesus cited Genesis: &ldquo;From the beginning of creation, &lsquo;male and  female he made them.&rsquo; &lsquo;For this reason a man &hellip;will be joined to his woman  and the two shall become one flesh&rsquo;&rdquo; (Mark 10:2-12; Matthew 19:3-12). Jesus&rsquo; point was that God&rsquo;s limiting of persons in a sexual union to two is  evident in his creation of two (and only two) primary sexes: male and female,  man and woman. The union of male and female completes the sexual spectrum,  rendering a third partner both unnecessary and undesirable. The sectarian Jewish group known as the Essenes similarly rejected polygamy on the grounds that God made us &ldquo;male and female,&rdquo; two sexual complements designed for a  union consisting only of two. Knust insinuates that Jesus wouldn&rsquo;t have opposed homosexual relationships.  Yet Jesus&rsquo; interpretation of Genesis demonstrates that he regarded a male-female  prerequisite for marriage as the foundation on which other sexual standards  could be predicated, including monogamy. Obviously the foundation is more  important than anything predicated on it. Jesus developed a principle of interpretation that Knust ignores: God&rsquo;s  &ldquo;from the beginning&rdquo; creation of &ldquo;male and female&rdquo; trumps some sexual  behaviors permitted in the Old Testament. So there&rsquo;s nothing unorthodox  about recognizing change in Scripture&rsquo;s sexual ethics. But note the  direction of the change: toward less sexual license and greater conformity  to the logic of the male-female requirement in Genesis. Knust is traveling  in the opposite direction. Knust&rsquo;s slavery analogy and avoidance of closer analogies Knust argues that an appeal to the Bible for opposing homosexual practice  is as morally unjustifiable as pre-Civil War appeals to the Bible for  supporting slavery. The analogy is a bad one. The best analogy will be the comparison that shares the most points of  substantive correspondence with the item being compared. How much does the  Bible&rsquo;s treatment of slavery resemble its treatment of homosexual practice?  Very little. Scripture shows no vested interest in preserving the institution of slavery  but it does show a strong vested interest from Genesis to Revelation in  preserving a male-female prerequisite. Unlike its treatment of the institution  of slavery, Scripture treats a male-female prerequisite for sex as a pre-Fall  structure. The Bible accommodates to social systems where sometimes the only alternative  to starvation is enslavement. But it clearly shows a critical edge by specifying  mandatory release dates and the right of kinship buyback; requiring that  Israelites not be treated as slaves; and reminding Israelites that God had  redeemed them from slavery in Egypt. Paul urged enslaved believers to use an opportunity for freedom to maximize service to God and encouraged a Christian master (Philemon) to free his slave  (Onesimus). How can changing up on the Bible&rsquo;s male-female prerequisite for sex be  analogous to the church&rsquo;s revision of the slavery issue if the Bible encourages  critique of slavery but discourages critique of a male-female paradigm for sex? Much closer analogies to the Bible&rsquo;s rejection of homosexual practice are the  Bible&rsquo;s rejection of incest and the New Testament&rsquo;s rejection of  polyamory (polygamy). Homosexual practice, incest, and polyamory are all (1) forms of sexual behavior  (2) able to be conducted as adult-committed relationships but  (3) strongly proscribed because (4) they violate creation structures  or natural law. Like same-sex intercourse, incest is sex between persons too much  structurally alike, here as regards kinship rather than gender.  Polyamory is a violation of the foundational &ldquo;twoness&rdquo; of the sexes. The fact that Knust chooses a distant analogue (slavery) over more  proximate analogues (incest, polyamory) shows that her analogical  reasoning is driven more by ideological biases than by fair use of  analogies. Knust&rsquo;s other arguments are riddled with holes. In claiming that David and Jonathan had a homosexual relationship she  confuses kinship affection with erotic love. Her claim that &ldquo;from the  perspective of the New Testament&rdquo; the Sodom story was about &ldquo;the near  rape of angels, not sex between men&rdquo; makes an "either-or" out of Jude  7&rsquo;s "both-and." Her canard that only a few Bible texts reject homosexual practice overlooks  other relevant texts and the fact that infrequent mention is often a sign of significance. It is disturbing to read what passes nowadays for expert  &ldquo;liberal&rdquo; reflections on what the Bible says about homosexual practice. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Robert A. J. Gagnon.]]></itunes:subtitle>

Even without considering Alley&rsquo;s personal ongoing weight struggle,  such a cruel comment is an insult to women and men everywhere.  One hopes that after pre-school, maybe at the very latest grade  school, children outgrow such hurtful and inane comments.&rdquo;  But it isn&rsquo;t only male comedians making disparaging weight-related remarks. Just a few months ago, comedian Kathy Griffin launched  a &ldquo;fat&rdquo; attack against last season&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dancing With the Stars&rdquo;  contestant Bristol Palin, likening her to the 350-pound fictional  character &ldquo;Precious.&rdquo;  FoxNews.com's Hollie McKay contributed to this report.

			<title>7 Things Not to Say During a Job Interview </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/7-things-not-to-say-during-a-job-interview-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">By Kathryn Elizabeth Tuggle</span></p>
<p>When interviewing for a job, we all want to put our best foot <br /> forward, but sometimes we end up putting it in our mouths instead.<br /><br /> Even though you may feel comfortable chatting and making small <br /> talk with your interviewer, it&rsquo;s best to leave some things unsaid.<br /><br /> We checked in with experts to find seven things you should never say during an interview.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>1.) Don't Compliment the Interviewer's Appearance in Any Way</strong><br /><strong> Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;I love your skirt!&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> &ldquo;Compliments on appearance are just too familiar,&rdquo; explains Patricia Lenkov, <br /> an executive recruiter at New York City-based Agility Executive Search. <br /> &ldquo;You are there for a purpose, and most interviewers want to keep that boundary. <br /> If you don&rsquo;t maintain a little distance, they might take it the wrong way.&rdquo;<br /><br /> If you are a man complimenting a woman, Lenkov added, it might be seen <br /> as sexist or derogatory, even if your intentions are pure. Compliments <br /> in same-sex interviews can also come across as insincere because the <br /> interviewer might think you&rsquo;re just sucking up or trying to get on his good side.<br /><br /> &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really taking a risk by saying something even as innocuous as, <br /> &lsquo;I like your boots,&rsquo;&rdquo; says Lenkov. &ldquo;What if the person hates those boots <br /> and only wore them because they broke a heel on their other shoes? <br /> It could really work against you.&rdquo;<br /><br /> If you&rsquo;re the kind of person who enjoys giving compliments, <br /> Lenkov suggests researching your interviewer&rsquo;s professional <br /> achievements before the interview and bring them up during the interview.  <br /><br /> What to say instead: &ldquo;I enjoyed reading about your corporate achievements in the paper last <br />month.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /> <strong>2.) Don&rsquo;t Cry</strong><br /><strong> Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;It was the hardest thing I ever went through, and I still break </strong><br /><strong> down just thinking about it.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Crying the first time you meet might lead the interviewer to think you&rsquo;re<br /> unstable, Lenkov says. Employers look for people who can handle <br /> high-pressure situations, and crying is a sign that you can&rsquo;t handle <br /> the stress of being put on the spot in front of another person.<br /><br /> Showing a prospective employer you can manage your emotions is <br /> almost as important as showing you can manage people, adds Lenkov.<br /><br /> &ldquo;I understand that we all cry, we are all human, but in an interview <br /> setting you have to keep composure. In most jobs, you will be asked <br /> to appear in front of executives or clients at certain times, and the <br /> interviewer needs to see how you handle yourself on the other side  of the table,&rdquo; says Lenkov.<br /><br /> If possible, avoid telling emotional stories in interviews, Lenkov suggests. <br /> If a moving story is relevant to the interview process, practice telling it <br /> as often as possible to avoid getting choked up.<br /><br /> &ldquo;If you tell at story 50 times and break down every time, that 51st time, <br /> you may not cry,&rdquo; says Lenkov. &ldquo;Practice until it becomes neutral, even <br /> if it makes you sad or angry.&rdquo;<br /><br /> What to say instead: &ldquo;It was difficult, but we pulled through.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /> <strong>3.)  Don't Talk About Illnesses Unless They&rsquo;re Relevant</strong><br /><strong> Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;My back is killing me, and this time of year is rough on my asthma.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> &ldquo;If there is a gap in your resume, it may be because you were in <br /> the hospital or had a serious illness, and then it&rsquo;s relevant to the<br /> job,&rdquo; says Lenkov. &ldquo;But if you&rsquo;re just talking about how sick you are, <br /> then it&rsquo;s not relevant.&rdquo;<br /><br /> Of course some medical topics can&rsquo;t be avoided, Lenkov says. <br /> If you walk in on crutches, offer an explanation, but keep it light.<br /><br /> &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say, &lsquo;Oh my god, I had gangrene and they almost had to amputate my leg. <br /> Keep it simple and be jovial when you can.&rdquo;<br /><br /> Steer clear of anything that invites an interviewer to give you sympathy, <br /> says Lenkov. If you detail the bad flu you just got over, the interviewer <br /> will feel obliged to offer commiseration or consolation of some sort, which <br /> weakens the professional boundaries.<br /><br /> What to say instead: &ldquo;During the gap in my resume, I was recuperating from <br /> surgery, and it hasn&rsquo;t been a problem since.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /><strong> 4.) Don&rsquo;t Talk about Problems at a Previous Company Unless it&rsquo;s to </strong><br /><strong> Show How You Persevered Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;I had so many problems with my former boss; he was a</strong><br /><strong> constant headache.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t specify that you found a solution to your problems, <br /> then any prospective employer will think that all you did was have <br /> problems at your last job,&rdquo; says David Adams, vice president of <br /> learning and development at staffing firm Adecco.<br /><br /> If an interviewer asks about a problem you faced at your previous<br /> employer, she is more interested in your ability to solve the problem <br /> than the actual problem, Adams says.<br /><br /> &ldquo;A lot of times people just use the &lsquo;challenges faced question&rsquo; <br /> to criticize their former boss or the team they used to work with. <br /> Even if they were horrible, you have to include that key word &lsquo;BUT,&rsquo;<br /> and then move on from there about what you did to succeed in that <br /> environment.&rdquo;<br /><br /> Make sure your answer highlights how you overcame adversities and <br /> cooperated with co-workers.<br /><br /> &ldquo;People who have those people skills go much further in their career <br /> and are hired much quicker when they can showcase that in an interview,&rdquo; <br /> says Adams. &ldquo;They see you as someone who can bring that same mindset to <br /> the new job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What to say instead: &ldquo;I dealt with several problems, but worked through them all successfully.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /><br /> <strong>5.) Don&rsquo;t Force Rapport</strong><br /><strong> Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;I see you have kids. I love kids!&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Don&rsquo;t try and force commonalities with your interviewer, advises Adams. <br /> Items in the interviewer&rsquo;s office might reflect his or her hobbies and <br /> interests, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to like the same things.<br /><br /> &ldquo;If someone has pictures up of their kids, and you comment on them but you <br /> don&rsquo;t have kids of your own, it feels completely fake,&rdquo; says Adams. &ldquo;Or if <br /> someone has a tennis trophy up and you comment on it, then be prepared to <br /> answer the question, &lsquo;Do you play tennis?&rsquo; If you have to say &lsquo;no,&rsquo; then it&rsquo;s like, <br /> &lsquo;why did you ask in the first place?&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /><br /> Rapport cannot be forced. If you don&rsquo;t see anything you have in common <br /> with the interviewer, that&rsquo;s fine; stick to small talk about the weather<br /> or ask questions about the company.<br /><br /> And don&rsquo;t be scared of a pause in the conversation; it gives the interviewer time to</p>
<p>take notes or form the next question.</p>
<p><br /> One of the most important things to remember during any interview <br /> is not to lie, advises Adams. You should never put yourself in a <br /> position where you have to answer a question that you&rsquo;re not prepared <br /> to answer.<br /><br /> What to say instead: &ldquo;Your offices are great. How long has your <br /> company been at this location?&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /><br /> <strong>6.)  Have No Questions </strong><br /><strong> Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;Nope. I think you went over everything. See you later!&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Not having questions is the kiss of death, says Michael Neece, co-founder of career</p>
<p>building site JobTacToe.com.  <br /><br /> Not having questions communicates you don&rsquo;t have any interest in the <br /> company and are just looking for a paycheck, says Neece. If nothing <br /> else, candidates should ask something like, &ldquo;What would be the three <br /> major things you need me to accomplish,&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are the qualities <br /> of people who are very successful at your company?&rdquo; suggests Neece.<br /><br /> Candidates who don&rsquo;t ask questions also come across as unprepared and unengaged.<br /> &ldquo;Interviewers are more impressed with questions you ask than with the answers <br /> you give,&rdquo; says Neece. &ldquo;They learn something about how you think by the <br /> questions you ask, and it lets them know what kinds of things you pay <br /> attention to. If you&rsquo;re asking a question about trends or challenges in <br /> their industry, you&rsquo;re really communicating, &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m interested in doing this job.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br /> What to say instead: &ldquo;I noticed that your company has won several awards. <br /> What do you think gives you that competitive edge?&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /> <strong>7.) Don&rsquo;t Say You Were Fired</strong><br /><strong> Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;At my last job, I got canned.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> &ldquo;Even if you were fired you just don&rsquo;t want to use that word,&rdquo; <br /> says Neece. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really loaded word.&rdquo;<br /><br /> Saying you were fired could shift the tone of the interview, and a <br /> prospective employer might start focusing on your bad attributes and<br /> wondering why you were dismissed instead of looking at your positives <br /> and focusing on your qualifications.<br /><br /> &ldquo;The truth is, you may be highly qualified and extremely good at your job,<br /> but it wasn&rsquo;t a good fit at the company,&rdquo; says Neece. &ldquo;But if you use the <br /> word &lsquo;fired,&rsquo; immediately, the interviewer may not be able to see past that.&rdquo;<br /><br /> But don&rsquo;t lie; your prospective employer may contact your former employer<br /> for more information. Find a way to explain the situation without using the  word &ldquo;fired.&rdquo;<br /><br /> &ldquo;You can say it was not a good fit and you and your employer went <br /> your separate ways,&rdquo; says Neece. &ldquo;Then describe what you learned <br /> from the experience and what you&rsquo;re focused on now.&rdquo;<br /><br /> What to say instead: &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a good fit at my last job, but I <br /> learned a lot about my skills and abilities and what I want to <br /> bring to my next position.&rdquo;<br /><br /><br /> Tell us!: What was the WORST job you had or still have in college? <br /> E-mail FoxBusinessMoney101@gmail.com with the job you wish you could forget!<br /><br /><br /> Read more: http://www.foxbusiness.com/personal-finance/2011/03/18/7-things-say-job-interview/#ixzz1HOwlIoKT</p>]]></description>

Even if they were horrible, you have to include that key word &lsquo;BUT,&rsquo; and then move on from there about what you did to succeed in that  environment.&rdquo; Make sure your answer highlights how you overcame adversities and  cooperated with co-workers. &ldquo;People who have those people skills go much further in their career  and are hired much quicker when they can showcase that in an interview,&rdquo;  says Adams. &ldquo;They see you as someone who can bring that same mindset to  the new job.&rdquo;
What to say instead: &ldquo;I dealt with several problems, but worked through them all successfully.&rdquo; 5.) Don&rsquo;t Force Rapport Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;I see you have kids. I love kids!&rdquo; Don&rsquo;t try and force commonalities with your interviewer, advises Adams.  Items in the interviewer&rsquo;s office might reflect his or her hobbies and  interests, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to like the same things. &ldquo;If someone has pictures up of their kids, and you comment on them but you  don&rsquo;t have kids of your own, it feels completely fake,&rdquo; says Adams. &ldquo;Or if  someone has a tennis trophy up and you comment on it, then be prepared to  answer the question, &lsquo;Do you play tennis?&rsquo; If you have to say &lsquo;no,&rsquo; then it&rsquo;s like,  &lsquo;why did you ask in the first place?&rsquo;&rdquo; Rapport cannot be forced. If you don&rsquo;t see anything you have in common  with the interviewer, that&rsquo;s fine; stick to small talk about the weather or ask questions about the company. And don&rsquo;t be scared of a pause in the conversation; it gives the interviewer time to
take notes or form the next question.
 One of the most important things to remember during any interview  is not to lie, advises Adams. You should never put yourself in a  position where you have to answer a question that you&rsquo;re not prepared  to answer. What to say instead: &ldquo;Your offices are great. How long has your  company been at this location?&rdquo; 6.)  Have No Questions  Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;Nope. I think you went over everything. See you later!&rdquo; Not having questions is the kiss of death, says Michael Neece, co-founder of career
building site JobTacToe.com.   Not having questions communicates you don&rsquo;t have any interest in the  company and are just looking for a paycheck, says Neece. If nothing  else, candidates should ask something like, &ldquo;What would be the three  major things you need me to accomplish,&rdquo; or &ldquo;What are the qualities  of people who are very successful at your company?&rdquo; suggests Neece. Candidates who don&rsquo;t ask questions also come across as unprepared and unengaged. &ldquo;Interviewers are more impressed with questions you ask than with the answers  you give,&rdquo; says Neece. &ldquo;They learn something about how you think by the  questions you ask, and it lets them know what kinds of things you pay  attention to. If you&rsquo;re asking a question about trends or challenges in  their industry, you&rsquo;re really communicating, &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m interested in doing this job.&rsquo;&rdquo; What to say instead: &ldquo;I noticed that your company has won several awards.  What do you think gives you that competitive edge?&rdquo; 7.) Don&rsquo;t Say You Were Fired Don&rsquo;t say: &ldquo;At my last job, I got canned.&rdquo; &ldquo;Even if you were fired you just don&rsquo;t want to use that word,&rdquo;  says Neece. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a really loaded word.&rdquo; Saying you were fired could shift the tone of the interview, and a  prospective employer might start focusing on your bad attributes and wondering why you were dismissed instead of looking at your positives  and focusing on your qualifications. &ldquo;The truth is, you may be highly qualified and extremely good at your job, but it wasn&rsquo;t a good fit at the company,&rdquo; says Neece. &ldquo;But if you use the  word &lsquo;fired,&rsquo; immediately, the interviewer may not be able to see past that.&rdquo; But don&rsquo;t lie; your prospective employer may contact your former employer for more information. Find a way to explain the situation without using the  word &ldquo;fired.&rdquo; &ldquo;You can say it was not a good fit and you and your employer went  your separate ways,&rdquo; says Neece. &ldquo;Then describe what you learned  from the experience and what you&rsquo;re focused on now.&rdquo; What to say instead: &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a good fit at my last job, but I  learned a lot about my skills and abilities and what I want to  bring to my next position.&rdquo; Tell us!: What was the WORST job you had or still have in college?

<br /><br /> Exodus International, the notorious "ex-gay" organization, has just <br /> released an iPhone app that, according to its website, is "designed <br /> to be a useful resource for men, women, parents, students, and ministry <br /> leaders."

			<title>Calif. county clerk defends gay marriage ban </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/calif-county-clerk-defends-gay-marriage-ban-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 13px; font-family: arial, verdana;">By ELLIOT SPAGAT</span></p>
<p>Associated Press<br /><br /> EL CENTRO, Calif. (AP) - Chuck Storey ran for county clerk-recorder <br /> in a remote, desert corner of southeast California on a pledge to <br /> run a lean operation in churning out government documents like <br /> property deeds, birth certificates and marriage licenses.<br /><br /> "Imperial County needs a businessman," he said during last year's campaign.<br /><br /> Less than two months in office, the low-key real estate agent became <br /> something else: a very public face against gay marriage in California. <br /> Storey asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month to let <br /> him be the primary defendant in a lawsuit to uphold Proposition 8- if <br /> a coalition of religious and conservative groups that sponsored the <br /> measure is removed.<br /><br /> Though Storey represents a county that voted overwhelmingly to ban <br /> gay marriage, his hometown critics say he was disingenuous when he <br /> didn't raise his intentions earlier. Many voters thought the county's <br /> role in the contentious issue ended Jan. 4 when the appeals court ruled<br /> its board of supervisors and deputy clerk had no legal standing to defend <br /> the ban.<br /><br /> Aaron Popejoy, president of the El Centro Chamber of Commerce, said the <br /> new clerk didn't mention gay marriage, or give any hint of the legal <br /> bombshell he was about to drop, at a Rotary Club lunch Feb. 24, the day <br /> before he stepped into the lawsuit.<br /><br /> "I'm a little disappointed that he would open up this can of worms for us," <br /> said Popejoy. "It's one of those huge red flags that draw the wrong kind of <br /> attention to our community. We need to be a little more warm and welcoming."<br /><br /> The Imperial Valley Press editorialized that Storey was inviting misguided <br /> stereotypes that the region is "bad or backward"- the kind of attention it <br /> got after becoming the only California county that tried to defend the <br /> marriage ban in 2009.<br /><br /> "We can't think of one bit of good to come out of this effort in retrospect. <br /> It was a waste of time, energy and was damaging to the county's reputation. <br /> And it's happening again thanks to one self-aggrandizing man in Storey," <br /> the newspaper wrote.<br /><br /> Storey's supporters note that 69.7 percent of county voters approved <br /> Proposition 8 in 2008. They say he is protecting voters' wishes, unlike <br /> former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Attorney General and current <br /> Gov. Jerry Brown and other elected officials who refused to defend the <br /> measure.<br /><br /> They also say the lifelong El Centro resident didn't hide his views. His <br /> campaign website touted his membership at El Centro's Christ Community Church, <br /> whose members were known to promote Proposition 8.<br /><br /> "I don't know why anyone should be surprised," said Dennis Freeman, 50, <br /> an associate pastor at Storey's church. "All Chuck's trying to do is say ... <br /> 'This is what the people voted for, so let's see if we can give them <br /> what they want.'"<br /><br /> Storey, 57, declined to answer questions or be photographed by <br /> The Associated Press.<br /><br /> "People are trying to take things out of context and I'm not going to <br /> get into it," the graying, bespectacled widower and father of three <br /> said in a brief phone conversation.<br /><br /> In his court filing, Storey wrote that he was in a bind over whether to <br /> obey voters' wishes as amended in the state constitution or a ruling by <br /> U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker that found the measure unconstitutional. <br /> He said he was concerned that Walker's decision "would create significant <br /> confusion for me and other Imperial County deputy clerks and officials in <br /> the performance of our legal duties regarding marriage."<br /><br /> Imperial, a county of 175,000 people that is battling 25 percent unemployment, <br /> is known more for its churches than nightclubs. The nearest gay bars are across <br /> the border in Mexicali, Mexico. There are no gay advocacy groups.<br /><br /> Lisa Solomon, a history instructor at Imperial Valley College who counts<br /> herself as one of four openly gay faculty members on a staff of about 250,<br /> says there aren't many social options for single women like herself.<br /><br /> "If you aren't attached, you're sort of in a no man's land," said Solomon, 50, <br /> who has tried without success to organize a campus group to promote <br /> tolerance of gays.<br /><br /> Phil Valenzuela, a 38-year old pharmacy technician in El Centro, has seen <br /> gay advocacy groups fizzle over the years due to lack of interest.<br /><br /> "We'll actually have a few meetings," he said. "They never go anywhere."<br /> County supervisors voted 3-2 in December 2009 to defend Proposition 8 <br /> after Supervisor Wally Leimgruber got in touch with Advocates for <br /> Faith &amp; Freedom, a Murieta law firm that, according to its website, <br /> fights court rulings "that have created a society increasingly devoid <br /> of the message and influence of God." The firm represented the county <br /> for free.<br /><br /> Last August, the board voted 4-1 to join the appeal after the measure <br /> was struck down.<br /><br /> "I don't believe in strange-sex marriage," said Leimbruger, a farmer <br /> who has been married 36 years. "I believe marriage is between one <br /> man and one woman."<br /><br /> Dolores Provencio, then clerk-recorder, resisted pressure to join the lawsuit. <br /> She said in an interview that she felt same-sex marriage was allowed under <br /> California law and declared it "a matter of tolerance."<br /><br /> Provencio, who estimates her office issued about 50 same-sex marriage <br /> licenses when the practice was briefly allowed in 2008, didn't seek<br /> another term after a 31-year run, leaving the field wide open.<br /><br /> Storey, the brother of a former Imperial County district attorney, <br /> ran as an outsider who would clean up an office that he said was <br /> plagued by inefficiency and bad employee morale. His only previous <br /> public involvement noted on his campaign website was a six-year <br /> stint on the El Centro Planning Commission.<br /><br /> He took office as county clerk-recorder the day before the appeals <br /> court ruled the county had no legal standing.<br /><br /> Leimgruber and another supervisor who supported the county's involvement <br /> in the lawsuit lost bids to remain in office. The new board had no <br /> appetite to continue the fight.<br /><br /> Gail Pellerin, president of the California Association of Clerks and <br /> Election Officials, knows of no other county clerks who have expressed <br /> interest in defending Proposition 8.<br /><br /> Imperial County supervisors say Storey is on his own. He is being <br /> represented by Advocates for Faith &amp; Freedom at no charge.<br /><br /> "We were not involved in any way, shape or form," said Supervisor <br /> Gary Wyatt, who has opposed the county's involvement. "It's a case of <br /> an individual who happens to be the clerk-recorder."<br /><br /> Supervisor Jack Terrazas, who has supported the county's involvement, <br /> said the court appeared to say the clerk is the only official who has <br /> a chance to prevail.<br /><br /> "He took the door that was left open and went right through it," Terrazas said. <br /> "If I were in that position, I might have taken the same door."<br /><br /></p>]]></description>

Storey asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month to let  him be the primary defendant in a lawsuit to uphold Proposition 8- if  a coalition of religious and conservative groups that sponsored the  measure is removed. Though Storey represents a county that voted overwhelmingly to ban  gay marriage, his hometown critics say he was disingenuous when he  didn't raise his intentions earlier. Many voters thought the county's  role in the contentious issue ended Jan. 4 when the appeals court ruled its board of supervisors and deputy clerk had no legal standing to defend  the ban. Aaron Popejoy, president of the El Centro Chamber of Commerce, said the  new clerk didn't mention gay marriage, or give any hint of the legal  bombshell he was about to drop, at a Rotary Club lunch Feb. 24, the day  before he stepped into the lawsuit. "I'm a little disappointed that he would open up this can of worms for us,"  said Popejoy. "It's one of those huge red flags that draw the wrong kind of  attention to our community. We need to be a little more warm and welcoming." The Imperial Valley Press editorialized that Storey was inviting misguided  stereotypes that the region is "bad or backward"- the kind of attention it  got after becoming the only California county that tried to defend the  marriage ban in 2009. "We can't think of one bit of good to come out of this effort in retrospect.  It was a waste of time, energy and was damaging to the county's reputation.  And it's happening again thanks to one self-aggrandizing man in Storey,"  the newspaper wrote. Storey's supporters note that 69.7 percent of county voters approved  Proposition 8 in 2008. They say he is protecting voters' wishes, unlike  former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Attorney General and current  Gov. Jerry Brown and other elected officials who refused to defend the  measure. They also say the lifelong El Centro resident didn't hide his views. His  campaign website touted his membership at El Centro's Christ Community Church,  whose members were known to promote Proposition 8. "I don't know why anyone should be surprised," said Dennis Freeman, 50,  an associate pastor at Storey's church. "All Chuck's trying to do is say ...  'This is what the people voted for, so let's see if we can give them  what they want.'" Storey, 57, declined to answer questions or be photographed by  The Associated Press. "People are trying to take things out of context and I'm not going to  get into it," the graying, bespectacled widower and father of three  said in a brief phone conversation. In his court filing, Storey wrote that he was in a bind over whether to  obey voters' wishes as amended in the state constitution or a ruling by  U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker that found the measure unconstitutional.  He said he was concerned that Walker's decision "would create significant  confusion for me and other Imperial County deputy clerks and officials in  the performance of our legal duties regarding marriage." Imperial, a county of 175,000 people that is battling 25 percent unemployment,  is known more for its churches than nightclubs. The nearest gay bars are across  the border in Mexicali, Mexico. There are no gay advocacy groups. Lisa Solomon, a history instructor at Imperial Valley College who counts herself as one of four openly gay faculty members on a staff of about 250, says there aren't many social options for single women like herself. "If you aren't attached, you're sort of in a no man's land," said Solomon, 50,  who has tried without success to organize a campus group to promote  tolerance of gays. Phil Valenzuela, a 38-year old pharmacy technician in El Centro, has seen  gay advocacy groups fizzle over the years due to lack of interest. "We'll actually have a few meetings," he said. "They never go anywhere." County supervisors voted 3-2 in December 2009 to defend Proposition 8  after Supervisor Wally Leimgruber got in touch with Advocates for  Faith &amp; Freedom, a Murieta law firm that, according to its website,  fights court rulings "that have created a society increasingly devoid  of the message and influence of God." The firm represented the county  for free. Last August, the board voted 4-1 to join the appeal after the measure  was struck down. "I don't believe in strange-sex marriage," said Leimbruger, a farmer  who has been married 36 years. "I believe marriage is between one  man and one woman." Dolores Provencio, then clerk-recorder, resisted pressure to join the lawsuit.  She said in an interview that she felt same-sex marriage was allowed under  California law and declared it "a matter of tolerance." Provencio, who estimates her office issued about 50 same-sex marriage  licenses when the practice was briefly allowed in 2008, didn't seek another term after a 31-year run, leaving the field wide open. Storey, the brother of a former Imperial County district attorney,  ran as an outsider who would clean up an office that he said was  plagued by inefficiency and bad employee morale. His only previous  public involvement noted on his campaign website was a six-year  stint on the El Centro Planning Commission. He took office as county clerk-recorder the day before the appeals  court ruled the county had no legal standing. Leimgruber and another supervisor who supported the county's involvement  in the lawsuit lost bids to remain in office. The new board had no  appetite to continue the fight. Gail Pellerin, president of the California Association of Clerks and  Election Officials, knows of no other county clerks who have expressed  interest in defending Proposition 8. Imperial County supervisors say Storey is on his own. He is being  represented by Advocates for Faith &amp; Freedom at no charge. "We were not involved in any way, shape or form," said Supervisor  Gary Wyatt, who has opposed the county's involvement. "It's a case of  an individual who happens to be the clerk-recorder." Supervisor Jack Terrazas, who has supported the county's involvement,  said the court appeared to say the clerk is the only official who has  a chance to prevail. "He took the door that was left open and went right through it," Terrazas said.  "If I were in that position, I might have taken the same door."]]></itunes:subtitle>

But in rare cases, a <br /> person infected with HIV does not become sick. Scientists have been <br /> studying these so-called "elite controllers" to better understand how they <br /> avoid AIDS. Researchers have unraveled part of the puzzle.<br /> In the vast majority of people infected with HIV, the virus overwhelms <br /> the immune system. The level of infection can be measured by counting <br /> virus particles in the blood. Mathias Lichterfeld, a researcher at <br /> Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, says in most patients <br /> it might be 50- or 100,000, or even a million virus particles per <br /> milliliter.<br /><br /> "And in these elite controllers, [who] are really just a very small <br /> proportion of HIV-infected patients, we can't find any of it. So that's <br /> really the point: for some reason, these patients are able to maintain<br /> undetectable HIV replication in the absence of any sort of treatment." <br /> The researchers focused on a protein called p21, which is a normal part <br /> of CD4 immune cells. Those immune cells are targets of HIV, but in elite <br /> controllers, the CD4 cells successfully fight off the HIV invaders.<br /><br /> "And what we figured out in this study is that this protein is just a <br /> lot stronger, a lot more strongly expressed, in patients who are <br /> elite controllers," Lichterfeld explains. "And it's actually pretty <br /> intense, it's like 10- to 20-fold higher, so substantial differences <br /> in comparison to any sort of additional HIV patient and also in <br /> comparison to HIV-negative persons."<br /><br /> Although the exceptional p21 response seems to play a key role in why <br /> elite controllers can be infected with HIV but keep the infection in <br /> check, Lichterfeld says it is probably only part of the process.<br /><br /> "We don't believe that that's the only mechanism.

Ferguson said the device was Microsoft Chairman  Bill Gates&rsquo;s bid to &ldquo;loosen iPod&rsquo;s stranglehold on the iPod market.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Zune has all the features of the iPod except it&rsquo;s not as good,&rdquo;  he said in 2006. &ldquo;Plus it can only download recordings of Bill Gates singing.&rdquo; To contact the reporters on this story: Dina Bass in Seattle at dbass2@bloomberg.net To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/what-can-we-learn-from-charlie-sheen-s-missteps-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>_ Good advice: Don't insult the boss. And, as Sheen did, don't insult <br /> your boss on radio, with the rest of the media world in wait to report <br /> whatever you say. And especially don't do it if he's a guy like Chuck <br /> Lorre, creator of "Two and a Half Men" (as well as other hit sitcoms, <br /> "The Big Bang Theory" and "Mike &amp; Molly"). And for sure, don't lob <br /> anti-Semitic slurs in the direction of that boss who has bailed you <br /> out of embarrassing scrapes over and over, while publicly defending you. <br /> That's just lousy office politics.<br /><br /><br /> _ Don't continue to brag about your work ethic and your sterling on-time <br /> record for getting to the job- that is, when you're not in rehab, shutting <br /> down your show- no matter how hard you've partied the night before. Showing <br /> up for work is what the boss pays you for, and what the customers <br /> (in Sheen's case, viewers) deserve. It's the least you can do. <br /> Don't expect a bonus for not being tardy.<br /><br /><br /> _ And when the boss pays you a lot (Sheen gets a reported $1.8 million an <br /> episode, the richest payday of any TV star), maybe you should remember that, <br /> at some point, your public might start resenting you for being so rich while <br /> behaving so badly. Ordinary Americans make do on an annual salary- or less-  than<br /> Sheen might spend in one night of partying.<br /><br /><br /> _ Don't mistake your own personal machismo (as Sheen did on the radio) for a <br /> macho role you played in a war film, "Platoon," a quarter-century ago. It makes <br /> you sound delusional. Besides, it's best to not mouth off about being a tough <br /> guy when you've already been in hot water for domestic violence.<br /><br /><br /> _ If you can't kick the drugs and the prostitutes, do yourself a favor and <br /> at least get someone to keep you away from your phone and Internet connection.<br /><br /><br /> When you play a character on a TV series, you should always keep in mind that <br /> your bread-and-butter depends on viewers relating to, and liking, that character. <br /> Up to now, Sheen's real-life mischief as a womanizer, substance abuser and overall <br /> hedonist seems to have enhanced the appeal of the character he plays on <br /> "Two and a Half Men," a lovable ladies' man conveniently named Charlie.<br /><br /><br /> But real-life Charlie and TV Charlie seem to be parting company. It's not a <br /> pleasant sight. TV Charlie isn't mean-spirited, hostile or anti-Semitic. <br /> Could growing revelations about real-life Charlie have finally begun to <br /> threaten TV Charlie's likeability?<br /><br /><br /> Maybe viewers, enlightened by Sheen's continuing misbehavior, will <br /> decide that a boozy Lothario isn't so funny after all, and instead <br /> maybe pathetic. Since it seems unclear that Sheen is ready to move on, <br /> wised-up "Two and a Half Men" viewers may be ready.<br /><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

			<title>Gay ’New Kid’ Says He’s Never Been in the Closet</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/gay-new-kid-says-he-s-never-been-in-the-closet]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>First, Carrie Fisher "outs" John Travolta in an interview with The Advocate.<br /> Now, Tiffany has let slip that New Kids on the Block member Jonathan Knight<br /> is gay. But Knight says his being gay wasn&rsquo;t a secret anyway.<br /> <br /> <br /> "I have never been outed by anyone but myself!" Knight posted in a <br /> blog at the band&rsquo;s blog, according to a Jan. 31 CNN blog posting. <br /> "I did so almost twenty years ago," added Knight, who is a native <br /> of Massachusetts.<br /> <br /> <br /> Knight was part of the popular boy band for ten years, starting in 1984. <br /> The band reformed in 2008. The following year, tabloid newspaper The <br /> National Enquirer published an article in which a purported male former <br /> lover, Braziian model Kyle Wilker, claimed that Knight was gay.<br /> <br /> <br /> "I never knew that I would have to [come out] all over again publicly just <br /> because I reunited with NKOTB!" Knight, 42, continued.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[First, Carrie Fisher "outs" John Travolta in an interview with The Advocate. Now, Tiffany has let slip that New Kids on the Block member Jonathan Knight is gay. But Knight says his being gay wasn&rsquo;t a secret anyway.   "I have never been outed by anyone but myself!" Knight posted in a  blog at the band&rsquo;s blog, according to a Jan. 31 CNN blog posting.  "I did so almost twenty years ago," added Knight, who is a native  of Massachusetts.   Knight was part of the popular boy band for ten years, starting in 1984.  The band reformed in 2008. The following year, tabloid newspaper The  National Enquirer published an article in which a purported male former  lover, Braziian model Kyle Wilker, claimed that Knight was gay.   "I never knew that I would have to [come out] all over again publicly just  because I reunited with NKOTB!" Knight, 42, continued. "I have lived my  life very openly and have never hidden the fact that I am gay!   "Apparently the pre-requisite to being a gay public figure is to appear on  the cover of a magazine with the caption &rsquo;I am gay,&rsquo; " Knight added. "I apologize for not doing so if this is what was expected! My belief is  that you live your life by example, and not by a caption on a magazine!"   The entertainer went on to say, "If there ever has been any confusion  about my sexuality, then you are someone that doesn&rsquo;t even know me!" However, he indicated a disinclination to make his sexuality a focus  of discussion, adding, "I love living my life being open and honest,  but at this time I choose not to discuss my private life any further!

<p>Show of support for "An Act Relative to Transgender Equal Rights."<br /><br /> Despite snow-covered roads last Thursday, Jan. 27, more than 75 transgender<br /> rights advocates and allies from across Massachusetts traveled to the State <br /> House in Boston to visit their legislators. Their goal was to show support <br /> and gather legislative co-sponsors for "An Act Relative to Transgender Equal <br /> Rights," a bill that, if passed, would add gender identity and expression to <br /> existing Massachusetts civil rights laws. <br /><br /><br /> "Our goal is to make legislators aware that there are constituents in their <br /> districts who care about this bill. Some of the folks visiting today are <br /> transgender themselves, some are friends, family, and allies," said Gunner <br /> Scott, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition <br /> (MTPC), which sponsored the Transgender Equal Rights Action Day. Scott said <br /> the number of legislative co-sponsors is indicative of the level of support <br /> that can be expected if the bill is voted on.<br /><br /><br /> The bill was first introduced in the 2007-2008 legislative session by <br /> Representatives Carl Sciortino and Byron Rushing, but over the past three <br /> sessions has been sent to committee study and has not been acted upon, <br /> despite having 104 co-sponsors -- the most co-sponsors of any bill in <br /> last year&rsquo;s session. <br /><br /><br /> "There are thousands of bills filed each year and many never make it <br /> to the floor for a vote," Scott said. He thinks that the bill will have <br /> as many co-sponsors this year, and is optimistic that it will make it to <br /> the floor this session. <br /><br /><br /> Zippy Ostroy, a retired speech pathologist from Brookline, doesn&rsquo;t know <br /> anyone who is transgender, but wanted to show her support for the issues. <br /> "Supporting equal rights for transgender people seems like an obvious <br /> thing. It&rsquo;s necessary," she said. "I didn&rsquo;t even realize the extent of <br /> the problem until I got involved with Keshet."<br /><br /><br /> Keshet is a Jewish organization that works for the inclusion of gay, <br /> lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. "But I&rsquo;m not <br /> concerned just with the problems that the Jewish community has with <br /> this -- it&rsquo;s a broader problem. And the discrimination and negative <br /> impacts of discrimination, including violence, employment problems, <br /> and housing problems, they shouldn&rsquo;t be there," Ostroy said. <br /><br /><br /> Ostroy said another reason she attended the day of action was because she <br /> thinks that organizations fighting against trans rights are slowing the <br /> process down. "The anti-rights groups, they&rsquo;re very vocal and organized. <br /> So I think any visible support for this bill is beneficial," she said.<br /><br /><br /> Joan Stratton, a clinical social worker from Mattapoisett, travelled almost<br /> two hours to show her support at the State House. "I&rsquo;m going to Senator <br /> Montigny&rsquo;s office and Representative Straus&rsquo;s office to say this is really <br /> important to me as a trans woman," she said. Stratton said that the trans <br /> people she knows in her area are not openly identified as trans because <br /> they&rsquo;re afraid of discrimination. "They could lose their jobs if their <br /> employers find out they identify this way," she says. <br /><br /><br /> Stratton herself was commuting to work in Rhode Island until recently <br /> because it is one of the few states where transgender people are offered <br /> equal protection in employment, housing, and credit. There are currently <br /> thirteen states with similar laws protecting people on the basis of gender <br /> identity. "I&rsquo;m a social worker; I help people for a living," she said. <br /> "I&rsquo;m [also] a Vietnam era veteran and I&rsquo;ve served my country since I <br /> was a teenager, and I&rsquo;d just like to have the favor returned."<br /><br /><br /> Elizabeth Maria Rivera Valentine, a community organizer for TransCEND, <br /> an HIV prevention and education program for trans women, says the law is <br /> particularly important for her clients, many of whom are homeless or <br /> unemployed but want to find work. "This law would put it in the books <br /> that they can&rsquo;t discriminate against us based on gender identity," she <br /> said. "It&rsquo;s basically adding the &rsquo;T&rsquo; in GLBT to all the laws." According <br /> to a 2009 survey by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 97 percent <br /> of transgender people surveyed experienced harassment on the job, and <br /> respondents experienced unemployment at almost double the rate of the <br /> general population.<br /><br /><br /> Valentine, who has a younger sister who is also transgender, feels that her <br /> advocacy of trans rights is setting an example for others. "I wanted to prove <br /> not only to my family, but to myself, that you can live a successful life as <br /> a trans woman," she said. "I think one of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned is that <br /> silence won&rsquo;t get you very far. You have to be able to speak up for your <br /> rights, and as human beings we deserve to be equal."<br /><br /><br /></p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Editorial28 January 2011 David Kato, a gay rights activist who campaigned against the  Anti-Homosexuality Bill, and who sued a local tabloid last year  after it named him as being homosexual, was killed in his home this week. Police say they are investigating the circumstances of his death  and it is not yet clear whether this was a homophobic attack in  which Mr Kato was targeted for his sexual orientation or his  thoughts about the matter. Whatever the motive behind the killing, this incident reminds  us of the homophobia that is widespread in our country and  society - and the deadly consequences of not dealing with it. Homosexuality is illegal under Ugandan law and the Anti  Homosexuality Bill prescribes harsher punishments,  including the death penalty for sodomy. While such legislation might serve as a deterrent, it will  not eliminate homosexuality and might cement the discrimination  of sexual minorities. The homosexuality question in Uganda has two major flaws.  First is that a lot of the debate is shouted down from  extreme positions of moral self-righteousness; as a result  there is little common understanding among those who oppose  gay rights and those who advocate for them. Secondly, a lot of the debate is carried out or influenced  by foreign actors - both in favour of and against homosexuality. What we need is an honest national dialogue on homosexuality in  order to forge a consensus on the rights of those Ugandans who  choose to be gay and those who oppose homosexuality as a lifestyle. Holding puritanical and extreme views on the matter, whether  liberal or conservative, will divide us, rather than help us  find a mutually acceptable compromise. People like David Kato and others who might be gay are Ugandans  and enjoy the same rights and protections of the law as heterosexuals.  We cannot send them into exile neither, lock them away, or hang them. We need to have an honest discussion about how to ensure that their  rights are upheld without violating the rights of other Ugandans. Peaceful and stable societies only emerge when we understand and try  to accommodate those who are different from us, or who disagree with us - not by ostracising or killing them.

                PHOENIX - The nation got its first look on Monday at the 22-year-old  loner accused of trying to assassinate Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Jared Loughner,  head shaved, a cut above the right temple and his hands cuffed, scanned a packed  courtroom and sat down. His attorney, who defended Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh  and ``Unabomber'' Ted Kaczynski, whispered to him. The judge asked Loughner if he understood that he could get life in  prison - or the death penalty - for killing federal Judge John Roll,  one of the six who died in the shooting rampage at Giffords' meeting  with constituents on Saturday in Tucson. ``Yes,'' he said, standing at a lecturn in his beige prison jumpsuit.  A U.S. marshal stood guard nearby. The judge ordered Loughner held without bail. Throngs of reporters and television news crews lined up outside the  federal courthouse, where the hearing was moved from Tucson because  Roll was a longtime judge at the federal courthouse there. Hours earlier, the nation observed a moment of silence for the victims of  the rampage, from the South Lawn of the White House and the steps of the U.S. Capitol to legislature beyond Arizona and the International Space Station. There, Giffords' brother-in-law, Scott, the commanding officer, spoke  over the radio. Flight controllers in Houston fell silent. ``As I look out the window, I see a very beautiful planet that seems very  inviting and peaceful,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it is not.'' ``These days, we are constantly reminded of the unspeakable acts of violence and damage we can inflict upon one another, not just with our actions, but  also with our irresponsible words,'' he said. ``We're better than this,'' he said. ``We must do better.'' On a frigid morning outside the White House, President Barack Obama and  first lady Michelle Obama stood side by side, each with their hands clasped, heads bowed and eyes closed. On the steps of the U.S. Capitol, congressional staff and other  employees did the same. At the Supreme Court, the justices paused for a moment of silence  between the two cases they were hearing Monday morning. Arizona's  chief federal judge, John Roll, was killed in the attack. The president called for the country to come together in prayer or  reflection for those killed and those fighting to recover. ``In the coming days we're going to have a lot of time to reflect,''  he said. ``Right now the main thing we're doing is to offer our thoughts  and prayers to those who've been impacted, making sure we're joining together  and pulling together as a country.'' In total, 19 people were shot in the rampage outside a supermarket where  Giffords held here meeting. Giffords was shot in the head, and remains in  intensive care. Among the six people killed were a 9-year-old girl who was born on the  day of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and was interested in public  service, as well as one of Giffords' aides.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Let's Talk About Sex<br /><br />By Jillian Eugenios From Curve Magazine <br /><br />Let&rsquo;s talk about sex, baby. <br /><br />Or, about how women don&rsquo;t seem to be talking about it&mdash;at least not to our <br />friends at The Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University. <br />The researchers have been collecting data for the largest contemporary <br />examination of how women have sex with women but numbers have been <br />dragging. They have conducted similar surveys with heterosexual groups <br />and gay men, whose community response numbers have been 30,000 and <br />23,000, respectively. The lesbians? Lagging behind at 1,300 globally. <br />Ladies, we can do better than that.<br /><br />The researchers are a passionate team looking to really understand <br />how women relate to one another sexually. The information learned from <br />the study will be used by sexual educators to promote pleasure, as well <br />as by medical professionals looking to help women identify ways to protect<br />themselves from risks. All this info will hopefully lead to safer and <br />happier sex for our community.<br /><br />As the Indiana researchers have pointed out, current knowledge of <br />sexual pleasure and risk between women is largely based on either <br />heterosexual models of sex or on information gathered from relatively <br />small groups of women. Let&rsquo;s change that.<br /><br />To participate and learn more about the survey click at womenshealth.iu.edu. <br />The survey takes 20 minutes, it&rsquo;s anonymous, and in the end you get a coupon <br />for 20 percent off a purchase at earlytobed.com.<br /><br />Win, win.<br /><br /></p>]]></description>

                <p>Aliya Leigh mentions how she came out to her parents and the consequences she <br /> suffered from them and her childhood religion.<br /><br /> Aliya Leigh gave an interview about God and her sexuality. As a child, she was <br /> raised a Jehovah's Witness, but knew she was gay. Knowing this, she tried to <br /> commit suicide because she knew her sexuality was a sickness in God's eyes.<br /><br /> For years, she denied her sexuality and tried to obey her bible principles. <br /> During these years, she felt like a zombie walking in society. With the help <br /> from friends, she was able to accept herself and her sexuality -- the way God <br /> made her.<br /><br /> Aliya Leigh is a spokesperson for teenagers who are part of the GLBT community <br /> and tries to help them in any way she can. She knows what they are going <br /> through and doesn't want them to suffer like she did as a teenager.<br /><br /> The article will be featured in the January 6 edition of Echo Magazine.<br /><br /> ###<br /><br /><br /> Aliya Leigh works as a producer, writer, editor and host of her own podcast<br /> entitled "Lesbian Life."

                Aliya Leigh Is Recognized as a Spokesperson for the GLBT Youth
                &nbsp;
                PHOENIX, AZ--(Marketwire - January 5, 2011) - In the interview with Echo Magazine,&nbsp;
                Aliya Leigh mentions how she came out to her parents and the consequences she  suffered from them and her childhood religion. Aliya Leigh gave an interview about God and her sexuality. As a child, she was  raised a Jehovah's Witness, but knew she was gay. Knowing this, she tried to  commit suicide because she knew her sexuality was a sickness in God's eyes. For years, she denied her sexuality and tried to obey her bible principles.  During these years, she felt like a zombie walking in society. With the help  from friends, she was able to accept herself and her sexuality -- the way God  made her. Aliya Leigh is a spokesperson for teenagers who are part of the GLBT community  and tries to help them in any way she can. She knows what they are going  through and doesn't want them to suffer like she did as a teenager. The article will be featured in the January 6 edition of Echo Magazine. ### Aliya Leigh works as a producer, writer, editor and host of her own podcast entitled "Lesbian Life." The online podcast is about current affairs happening  and affecting the lesbian community globally. Aliya writes and edits film and television scripts, as well as young adult  horror, suspense and thriller novels. She is a skateboard designer for the  Puzzle Me line. Aliya Leigh owns Striving For Pi, LLC; which is a Production and Publishing  company. Striving For Pi, LLC resources will be dedicated to independent films,  web shows and graphic novels. She is a trustee of the National Writer's Union, on the Board of Directors  of AZWIT and an active member of ASCAP. Email: aliyaleigh@aliyaleigh.com Phone: (520) 405-2724

                <p><strong>"When are you going to talk about scripture that </strong><br /><strong> condemns homosexuality?"</strong></p>
                <p>By Rev. Candance Chellew-Hodge<br /><br /><br /> The question came from a young woman who attended a workshop based <br /> on my book Bulletproof Faith: A Spiritual Survival Guide for Gay and <br /> Lesbian Christians. This particular workshop was held a couple of years <br /> ago on a college campus and attracted a cross-section of students who <br /> were both supporters and detractors of homosexuality.<br /><br /> This question is usually asked by a pro-gay person who wants to<br /> know how to answer challengers who quote scripture. This woman <br /> was different -- she had come for an argument and intended to <br /> challenge me with anti-gay interpretations of scripture.<br /><br /> "We're not going to talk about those passages specifically," I told her. <br /> "Instead, part of this workshop is on why we should never argue scripture <br /> with anyone ever again."<br /><br /> She was visibly disappointed and left halfway through the workshop. <br /> I now realize that I should have given her a more in-depth answer to <br /> her question, because there are still plenty of people, both for and <br /> against homosexuality, who insist on arguing about what the Bible does <br /> and does not say about homosexuality.<br /><br /> There are several reasons that gays and lesbians should never argue <br /> scripture. First, it's pointless and nobody wins. Those who are anti-gay <br /> have their authorities and scriptural interpretations and so do pro-gay <br /> people. No one wins a "they said, they said" argument because no one will <br /> believe the scholars from either side no matter what argument anyone makes.<br /><br /> Secondly, arguing over scripture just hardens the opinions of both sides.<br /> Neither side is willing to give an inch. This is not a true dialogue, it's<br /> simply a contest of who can argue the longest, and usually the loudest. No <br /> one is convinced, and everyone leaves further entrenched in their own ideas, <br /> and usually angry. No education happens, and little, if any, compassion ever happens.<br /><br /> Thirdly, the arguers on either side never share the same starting point on <br /> scripture. Those who are anti-gay are more likely to see the Bible as the <br /> infallible "Word of God" -- which means the words literally dripped from <br /> the lips of God through the pens of the scribes and onto the page. Each <br /> jot and tittle is God-breathed and never to be contradicted. (Never mind<br /> that much of the Bible is full of contradictions and much of it we <br /> disregard with impunity these days. Those sorts of inconveniences <br /> never actually apply to the argument around homosexuality.)<br /><br /> Those who argue from the pro-gay side are generally those who see the Bible <br /> as inspired by God, but not the literal, infallible words of God. This means <br /> they are more open to different interpretations and approaches to scripture. <br /> Those who see the Bible as "God's literal word" only know one way to read any<br /> passage, and it's usually to back up their current beliefs about God, <br /> homosexuality or any other issue.<br /><br /> The most important reason, however, that gays and lesbians should never, <br /> ever argue about scripture is because the Bible has nothing much to say <br /> about homosexuality. We have to remember that this is an ancient book. <br /> It was written at a time when people believed the world was flat and that <br /> the earth was in the middle of a three-tiered world with heaven above and <br /> hell below. It was written at a time when people believed that the whole of <br /> human reproduction was held in the sperm of a man and a woman was merely an <br /> incubator. Speaking of women, this was a time when they were seen as chattel<br /> -- property to be passed along from father to husband, from husband to <br /> brother and so on. It was written at a time when slavery was seen as <br /> God-ordained and animal sacrifice was the way to cleanse sins.<br /><br /> In short, we cannot extract modern ideas from an ancient book. The writers <br /> of the Bible no more understood homosexuality than they understood that a <br /> spherical Earth orbited the sun. At most, we have a commentary on same-sex <br /> sexual behavior involving lust and abuse, but nothing -- pro or con -- about <br /> the modern concept of sexual orientation. We don't take the Bible's word for <br /> it that the earth is flat and women only incubate babies and contribute nothing <br /> else to the process. Why on earth would we take it as an authority on sexual orientation?<br /><br /> The Bible remains a holy book because it maps humanity's journey with God, <br /> and not the other way around. Because it maps our journey with God, it maps <br /> our evolving understanding of how the Holy works in this world. Humanity has <br /> moved from seeing God as a harsh judge and lawmaker to a seeing God as full <br /> of grace, mercy and love.<br /><br /> We don't learn about God by pulling out tiny details of the book and <br /> proclaiming them as true for all time. Instead, the Bible puts us in <br /> touch with God when we recognize its overarching message, which can be<br /> summarized by 1 John 4:7-8: "Beloved, let us love one another, because <br /> love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.<br /> Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love."<br /><br /> The reason gays and lesbians should never argue over scripture is because, <br /> not only does scripture not condemn homosexuality, arguing over it produces<br /> nothing but strife, division and hatred. Anything that does not promote love <br /> is not of God. Instead of arguing, let us love one another, even those with <br /> whom we disagree. This is God's message to us. Nothing else matters. <br /><br /></p>

                <p>(Health.com) -- Prevention is the best cure for a hangover.

Hangovers make you feel horrible <br /> because alcohol is toxic, Cutler explains, and you need to give<br /> your body a chance to recover. That morning drink could lead to <br /> an even worse hangover the following day.<br /><br /><br /> Greasy breakfast<br /><br /><br /> There's no scientific evidence that a heaping helping of bacon <br /> and eggs will ease hangover anguish, although many people swear<br /> by it. "Greasy food is just going to give you heartburn," says <br /> Cutler, who recommends sticking with easy-to-digest foods such<br /> as toast or cereal. "You want to get calories right back into <br /> your system."<br /><br /><br /> Eat light and stay hydrated, agrees John Brick, Ph.D., an alcohol <br /> research scientist and author of "The Doctor's Hangover Handbook."<br /><br /> "No specific foods are recommended, although honey sandwiches are<br /> helpful to some people," Brick says.

                Isabelle Caro, a French actress and model whose emaciated image  appeared in a shock Italian ad campaign and whose anorexia and  career were followed by others suffering from eating disorders,  has died at the age of 28. Her longtime acting instructor, Daniele Dubreuil-Prevot, told  The Associated Press on Wednesday that Caro died on Nov. 17  after returning to France from a job in Tokyo. Dubreuil-Prevot said she did not know the cause of death  but that Caro "had been sick for a long time," referring to  her anorexia. Caro was featured in an ad campaign by Italian photographer  Oliviero Toscani in 2007 for an Italian fashion house. Under  the headline "No Anorexia," images across newspapers and billboards  showed Caro naked, vertebrae and facial bones protruding. In later interviews, she said she weighed about 27 kilograms, or  59 pounds, when the photos were taken. Caro said on her blog and in interviews that she had suffered from anorexia since she was 13. She wrote a book published in France in  2008 titled "The Little Girl Who Didn't Want to Get Fat." The Italian ad campaign came as the fashion industry came under an  unusually bright spotlight about anorexia, after a 21-year-old  Brazilian model died from the eating disorder. Her agent, Sylvie  Fabregon, told AP that it was intended "to show what it is like to  be anorexic." Some groups working with anorexics warned, however, that it did a  disservice to those afflicted with the disorder. Images of Caro appeared on so-called pro-ana, or pro-anorexia  websites. On Wednesday, one posted a notice about her death  and a photo of her, large blue-green eyes peering over a child-size  upper arm, with the caption, "die young, stay pretty." Her life and death drew other kinds of followers, as well. Swiss singer Vincent Bigler and Caro had been working on a video  for a song he wrote about anorexia called "J'ai fin," a wordplay  in French that means roughly "I am the end" but is pronounced  identically to "I am hungry." Bigler said he penned the song after being so moved and worried by  seeing Caro on television, and meant the lyrics to focus on hope  and healing. Caro "left me with many images, and much hope," he said by telephone, describing her different moods and ideas as they worked on the project  together. Caro herself spoke out about her anorexia and her efforts to recover,  and the menace of eating disorders on the fashion industry. Her acting instructor described years in and out of hospitals.  Her death and her illness "are an absolute waste," Dubreuil-Prevot said. Caro's Facebook page says she was born Sept. 12, 1982. She took violin  lessons and then acting lessons in Nantes and Versailles, according to  Dubreuil-Prevot. The Italian ad campaign gained Caro widespread attention in media in  countries around Europe and in the United States. She subsequently  served as a member of the jury on Top Model France, and worked  periodically as a film and television actress. Caro's father alerted a few close friends at the time of her death,  and a funeral service was held in Paris, according to Dubreuil-Prevot. Her family could not be reached for comment Wednesday. In one online video, Caro ends with words of advice for aspiring models:  "Believe in life."

			<title>8 Myths About Women's Bodies Debunked</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/8-myths-about-women-s-bodies-debunked]]></link>

                <p>1. <strong>Myth:</strong> The clitoris is a magic arousal button.<br /><br /> <strong>Truth:</strong> While the clitoris IS crucial to most women's arousal and orgasm, <br /> every woman has different preferences regarding its stimulation. It's not <br /> a doorbell, and you can't just push it to be let inside! (Fun clitoral <br /> fact: The clitoris is not just that little organ you can find at the top <br /> of a woman's vulva -- it extends into her body like a wishbone, with <br /> legs at least 2 inches long, and all of it can be erotically sensitive <br /> because it becomes engorged and erect when aroused).<br /><br /><br /> 2. <strong>Myth:</strong> There's no such thing as a G-spot.<br /><br /> <strong>Truth:</strong> The Grafenberg Spot (named after Dr. Ernst Grafenberg) does <br /> exist, and it is comparable to a man's prostate. It's glandular <br /> tissue that surrounds the urethra and in some percentage of women <br /> it is indeed sexually sensitive, especially to pressure.<br /><br /><br /> 3. <strong>Myth:</strong> Every woman has a G-spot and should find it, or she won't have  optimal sex. <br /><br /> <strong>Truth:</strong> The truth is while every woman does indeed have a G-spot, not <br /> every woman loves G-spot stimulation. For some, it's &ldquo;Wow!;&rdquo; for others,<br /> &ldquo;Ehh;&rdquo; and for still others it can actively feel irritating -- not a <br /> sensation to pursue for long, much less add to your repertoire. Plus, <br /> if she's not turned on when you get started, it's not likely to feel sexy.<br /><br /><br /> 4. <strong>Myth:</strong> Nipple stimulation is a must for getting a woman aroused<br /><br /> <strong>Truth:</strong> Some women LOVE nipple stroking, licking and sucking, and some can <br /> even orgasm this way. But other women really don't care for it at all, <br /> especially when you twist them like radio dials. You're not trying to get <br /> a signal from outer space, you know!<br /><br /><br /> 5.<strong> Myth:</strong> Women who don't reach orgasm during sex just have partners who  don't last long enough<br /><br /> <strong>Truth:</strong> More than half of women (some studies say way more than half) <br /> don't orgasm during intercourse. In fact, more important than duration <br /> of intercourse for many women may be how aroused she was when it began <br /> -- which means all the sexy stuff that comes before intercourse may be <br /> the most important element. If you're going to worry about time, <br /> remember that minutes (or hours) spent on that kind of pleasuring is time <br /> well-spent.<br /><br /><br /> 6. <strong>Myth: </strong>There are secrets you can learn that will let you please  ANY woman<br /><br /> <strong>Truth:</strong> While sexual secrets may well be worth learning, the only <br /> secrets that really matter tonight are the ones that matter to <br /> the woman you're with right now. Learn those preferences and <br /> responses and she'll consider you a great lover -- the tricks <br /> that worked on your ex (or that you spent money to learn in a <br /> Get More Girls seminar) may not be the things that float her boat, <br /> since women are individuals erotically as well as in other ways!<br /><br /><br /> 7. <strong>Myth:</strong> Pheromones are the key to her arousal<br /><br /> <strong>Truth:</strong> The nose knows, eh? While appreciating a partner's pheromonal <br /> signature (which you can't just sniff like cologne) may be <br /> a key element of attraction, that doesn't mean you can slap <br /> on some of that special after shave you got because you were <br /> reading the spam e-mails promising you success in bed. Those <br /> are often made of pig pheromones anyway, and you'd HATE it if <br /> she left you for Porky.<br /><br /><br /> 8. <strong>Myth:</strong> You&rsquo;d be able to tell if she faked it for sure.<br /><br /> <strong>Truth:</strong> A recent study revealed that men thought their female partners <br /> orgasmed about 20 percent more often than they actually did. Apparently <br /> it&rsquo;s common for a woman to fake her orgasm, and the very best way to<br /> know if it's happening is to talk to her intimately to make sure you <br /> know what truly works for her -- and then do those things! She won't <br /> even think about faking orgasm if she's having an orgasm.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /> Read more: http://www.foxnews.com/health/2010/12/22/myths-womens-bodies-debunked/#ixzz18x2gAnhy</p>

                 WASHINGTON &mdash; President Barack Obama is praising senators as they  near passage of legislation that would overturn the military ban on openly gay troops. Obama says that policy undermines U.S. national security and violates  "the very ideals" that members of the armed services risk their lives to defend. A final Senate vote is set for 3 p.m. Saturday after a test vote in the morning set the stage to send the measure to Obama to sign. The president says ending the ban will mean that "thousands of patriotic Americans"  won't be forced to leave the military "despite years of exemplary performance,  because they happen to be gay." He also says many thousands more won't be "asked to live a lie in order  to serve the country they love." December 18, 2010 12:52 PM EST Copyright 2010, The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

			<title>10 in ’10: Freedom to Marry’s Top Ten Moments for Marriage in 2010</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>10.  President Obama moves in the right direction on the journey to marriage </strong><br /><br /> At a October 27th meeting with progressive bloggers, President Obama <br /> signaled that he, like President Clinton before him, is making progress <br /> on his personal journey to supporting the freedom to marry.  A question <br /> from AmericaBlog&rsquo;s Joe Sudbay prompted President Obama to talk about couples <br /> and say, &ldquo;Attitudes evolve, including mine.&rdquo; <br /><br /><br /> <strong>9. Illinois enacts civil union, en route to the freedom to marry </strong><br /><br /> In November, Illinois took steps toward marriage when, after heart-wrenching<br /> speeches about loving and committed gay and lesbian couples, legislators <br /> passed a civil union bill.  Governor Pat Quinn has pledged to sign the <br /> bill and Chicago Mayor Richard Daley immediately called for the next <br /> step: marriage.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>8. Marriage supporters outnumber opponents at every stop of </strong><br /><strong> the Summer Tour for Marriage</strong><br /><br /> The so-called &ldquo;National Organization for Marriage&rdquo; (NOM) launched <br /> a 23-city &ldquo;Summer for Marriage&rdquo; tour of rallies to promote anti-gay <br /> discrimination. Freedom to Marry led national and state groups in <br /> responding, going head-to-head with NOM in every city, bringing <br /> out more people, putting forward more stories, and showing America <br /> what being FOR marriage is really all about.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>7. Essence Magazine does its first feature on the wedding of </strong><br /><strong> a same-sex couple</strong><br /><br /> In October, Essence Magazine shared with its readers the story <br /> of Aisha and Danielle, a beautiful African-American lesbian couple <br /> who married in Washington, D.C. this year.  It was the first time <br /> the magazine had done a feature on a same-sex couple. The comments <br /> from readers were overwhelmingly positive &ndash; a testament to the <br /> importance of personal stories about why marriage matters.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>6. Victory in federal challenges to so-called &ldquo;DOMA&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Over the summer, District Court Judge Joseph Tauro found that the<br /> federal government&rsquo;s refusal to honor the marriages of same-sex <br /> couples under the so-called &ldquo;Defense of Marriage Act&rdquo; is <br /> unconstitutional.   &ldquo;[Because] animus alone cannot constitute <br /> a legitimate government interest, this court finds that DOMA <br /> lacks a rational basis to support it,&rdquo; said the Nixon-appointee <br /> in cases brought by GLAD and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,<br /> now on appeal to the federal First Circuit.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>5. Pro-marriage governors elected in CA, NY, MD, MN, RI, NH</strong><br /><br /> While the mid-term elections brought a mixed bag of results as <br /> Americans agonized over the economy, gubernatorial candidates <br /> who openly supported the freedom to marry &ndash;  including some who <br /> ran on a promise to pass a marriage bill in their state and <br /> others facing opposition from the likes of NOM &ndash; were elected <br /> across the country from Rhode Island to California.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>4. The freedom to marry comes to Latin America</strong><br /><br /> The freedom to marry came to both Mexico City and Argentina this <br /> year &ndash; a breathtaking advance in two nations with strong religious <br /> roots.  The Mexico Supreme Court affirmed the law, and with a foothold <br /> for the freedom to marry in Latin America, alongside 2010 wins in <br /> Portugal and Iceland, gay and lesbian couples can now marry in 12 <br /> countries on 4 continents &ndash; up from zero a decade ago.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>3. Federal court finds California&rsquo;s Proposition 8 unconstitutional</strong><br /><br /> Chief Judge Vaughn Walker struck down California&rsquo;s Proposition 8 as <br /> unconstitutional, finding that "the essence of the right to marry is <br /> freedom to join in marriage with the person of one's choice."  <br /> The anti-gay opponents are again shown to have no good reason <br /> for excluding committed couples from marriage.  Even with the <br /> case itself on appeal before the Ninth Circuit, the authoritative <br /> opinion based on powerful evidence and former Bush Solicitor-General <br /> Ted Olson and Republican party chief Ken Mehlman as unlikely voices <br /> for the freedom to marry continue to have a powerful impact.  While <br /> the appellate court deliberates,  the outgoing and incoming governors <br /> and attorneys general of California agreed with Judge Walker that <br /> Prop 8 must fall.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>2. Gay and lesbian couples begin marrying in our Nation&rsquo;s Capital </strong><br /><br /> In March, Washington, DC became the first majority-minority jurisdiction <br /> in the country where gay couples can marry, joining 5 states.  Mayor Adrian <br /> Fenty signed the bill into law in a public ceremony at a church in front of <br /> hundreds of people including his parents.   At year-end, 40% of Americans <br /> live in a state with marriage or at least some recognition for same-sex <br /> couples and their families &ndash; up from virtually zero a decade ago.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>1.  Polls find for the first time that a majority of Americans support </strong><br /><strong> the freedom to marry</strong><br /><br /> 2010 was the first year that polls showed a majority of Americans <br /> in support of the freedom to marry!  The milestone was further <br /> proof that as more gay and lesbian people talk to their friends, <br /> family, and coworkers about Why Marriage Matters, people around <br /> the country are realizing that there is no good reason to continue <br /> state-sponsored discrimination against loving and committed couples, <br /> particularly in tough economic times.<br /><br /><br /> Special Bonus: The new and improved Freedom to Marry campaign<br /><br /> To fill the gaps, meet the challenges, and seize the opportunities <br /> to win marriage nationwide, Freedom to Marry spent 2010 ramping up <br /> and reinventing itself to be the national campaign the movement needs <br /> to get the job done.    Freedom to Marry added capacity in communications, <br /> field, messaging and research, and new media; prepared to roll out a <br /> national public education campaign; and worked to increase support for <br /> the work of key frontline partners to further the national strategy, <br /> Freedom to Marry&rsquo;s Roadmap to Victory, which calls for work to win more <br /> states, grow and diversify the majority for marriage, and tackle federal <br /> marriage discrimination.   Working together in this campaign, we can <br /> make 2011, like 2010, another winning year for the freedom to marry.<br /><br /><br /> <strong>From:</strong> http://http://www.freedomtomarry.org/blog/entry/10-in-10-freedom-to-marrys-top-ten-moments-for-marriage-in-2010 <br /><br /></p>]]></description>

                On the heels of World AIDS Day comes a stunning medical breakthrough: Doctors believe an HIV-positive man who underwent a stem cell transplant has been cured as a result of the procedure. Timothy Ray Brown, also known as the "Berlin Patient," received the transplant in 2007 as part of a lengthy treatment course for leukemia. His doctors recently published a report in the journal Blood affirming that the results of extensive  testing "strongly suggest that cure of HIV infection has been achieved." Brown's case paves a path for constructing a permanent cure for HIV through  genetically-engineered stem cells. Last week, Time named another AIDS-related discovery to its list of the  Top 10 Medical Breakthroughs of 2010. Recent studies show that healthy  individuals who take antiretrovirals, medicine commonly prescribed for  treating HIV, can reduce their risk of contracting the disease by up to 73 percent. While these developments by no means prove a cure for the virus has been  found, they can certainly provide hope for the more than 33 million  people living with HIV worldwide.

			<title>My Confession</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/my-confession]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>My confession is, I don't know how to date someone. &nbsp;I started dating when I was 18 years old. It was weird, but I remember it so well. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>My mother would do anything to get out of the house. &nbsp;I was such a nerd back then. &nbsp;All I cared about was hacking and making computer virus. &nbsp;OMG. My mother pissed me off and I programmed a virus for her computer back in the day. &nbsp;I used DOS to write the virus. The virus copied Window 3.1 to the hard drive until the computer crashed. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>So yeah, my mother need me to get out of the house. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>So, I went to a party and this guy began dancing with me. &nbsp;He was older than I was, but I didn't care. He was interested in me; which was so cool. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>Well, because of my childhood religion, the guy who was interested in me wanted to get married right away so he could have sex. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>I met Brian and I was so in love. &nbsp;He still has my heart and soul; even though I am gay. &nbsp;He actually kicked me out of the closet. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>So now, I realizes, I don't know how to deal with a relationship. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>Being raised as a Jehovah's Witness:</p>
                <p>1) First you meet someone in the church who is the opposite sex of you</p>
                <p>2) You date for 4 months</p>
                <p>3) You get engage&nbsp;</p>
                <p>4) Within a year, you are married</p>
                <p>These are the four steps of a relationship, I only know about. I don't know what to do in a relationship; which could be why I fail in relationships all the time. I don't get know what to do or what to say.</p>
                <p>I try to be supportive, honest and caring. But, it seems like it doesn't work or is it that I try too hard to make it work. I don't know. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>I may never get married or find the girl of my dreams, but I do love myself and I'm in a relationship with myself.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Seriously, I don't know how to date and I wish I knew how to get a stable girlfriend who understands me. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[
                My confession is, I don't know how to date someone. &nbsp;I started dating when I was 18 years old. It was weird, but I remember it so well. &nbsp;
                My mother would do anything to get out of the house. &nbsp;I was such a nerd back then. &nbsp;All I cared about was hacking and making computer virus. &nbsp;OMG. My mother pissed me off and I programmed a virus for her computer back in the day. &nbsp;I used DOS to write the virus. The virus copied Window 3.1 to the hard drive until the computer crashed. &nbsp;
                So yeah, my mother need me to get out of the house. &nbsp;
                So, I went to a party and this guy began dancing with me. &nbsp;He was older than I was, but I didn't care. He was interested in me; which was so cool. &nbsp;
                Well, because of my childhood religion, the guy who was interested in me wanted to get married right away so he could have sex. &nbsp;
                I met Brian and I was so in love. &nbsp;He still has my heart and soul; even though I am gay. &nbsp;He actually kicked me out of the closet. &nbsp;
                So now, I realizes, I don't know how to deal with a relationship. &nbsp;
                Being raised as a Jehovah's Witness:
                1) First you meet someone in the church who is the opposite sex of you
                2) You date for 4 months
                3) You get engage&nbsp;
                4) Within a year, you are married
                These are the four steps of a relationship, I only know about. I don't know what to do in a relationship; which could be why I fail in relationships all the time. I don't get know what to do or what to say.
                I try to be supportive, honest and caring. But, it seems like it doesn't work or is it that I try too hard to make it work. I don't know. &nbsp;
                I may never get married or find the girl of my dreams, but I do love myself and I'm in a relationship with myself.&nbsp;
                Seriously, I don't know how to date and I wish I knew how to get a stable girlfriend who understands me. &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;

                December 8, 2010 Hackers Give Web Companies a Test of Free Speech By ASHLEE VANCE and MIGUEL HELFT A hacking free-for-all has exploded on the Web, and Facebook and Twitter are stuck in the middle. On Wednesday, anonymous hackers took aim at companies perceived to have harmed WikiLeaks after its release of a flood of confidential  diplomatic documents. MasterCard, Visa and PayPal, which had cut off  people&rsquo;s ability to donate money to WikiLeaks, were hit by attacks  that tried to block access to the companies&rsquo; Web sites and services. To organize their efforts, the hackers have turned to sites like Facebook and Twitter. That has drawn these Web giants into the  fray and created a precarious situation for them. Both Facebook and Twitter &mdash; but particularly Twitter &mdash; have  received praise in recent years as outlets for free speech.  Governments trying to control the flow of information have  found it difficult to block people from voicing their concerns  or setting up meetings through the sites. At the same time, both Facebook and Twitter have corporate aspirations  that hinge on their ability to serve as ad platforms for other companies. This leaves them with tough public relations and business decisions  around how they should handle situations as politically charged as the WikiLeaks developments. Some internet experts say the situation highlights the complexities  of free speech issues on the Internet, as grassroots Web companies  evolve and take central control over what their users can make public.  Clay Shirky, who studies the Internet and teaches at New York University,  said that although the Web is the new public sphere, it is actually  &ldquo;a corporate sphere that tolerates public speech.&rdquo; Marcia Hofmann, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said,  &ldquo;Any Internet user who cares about free speech or has a controversial or unpopular message should be concerned about the fact that intermediaries might not let them express it.&rdquo; She added, &ldquo;Your free speech rights are only as strong as the weakest intermediary.&rdquo; The problem came into relief on Wednesday, through an effort called Operation Payback, organized by a group calling itself Anonymous.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Police had to taser Michael L. Brea to subdue him before bringing  him to a Brooklyn hospital with a guard. Michael L. Brea, who has appeared on episodes of Ugly Betty and in  Step-Up 3D, brutally murdered his mother with a Samurai sword while  screaming biblical passages, police confirm. Police were called to Brea's Brooklyn, New York apartment after neighbors heard screaming around 2:20 a.m. Tuesday morning. "I hear the brother chasing her [his mother] through the house and  he's just saying a bunch of [Bible] passages like, 'Repent, Repent, Repent,'"  neighbor Gregory Clare told local television station WPIX 11 News. "I heard him  chasing her through the house and I hear a loud scream and so I have  my father call the cops, call 911." Brea, who also appeared in Coke commercials, had decapitated and  stabbed his mother, 55-year-old Yannick, multiple times. Police said he was emotionally disturbed and they had to taser him to subdue him. They described the apartment as &ldquo;extremely bloody.&rdquo; He was taken to  Kings County Hospital with a police guard. NYPD spokeswoman Officer Doris Otero tells The Hollywood Reporter,  "They found a black female, Yannick, with multiple stab wounds on her body. EMS pronounced her DOA." "I had just dozed off to go to sleep and then I woke up to  somebody screaming," said Bernard Bent, another resident.  "It sounded like a lady's voice and after a while I just didn't hear  the woman's voice again." Brea, who was described by neighbors as "quiet," was into martial arts. He has a twin brother, and also owned a Subway restaurant shop, giving away 300 sandwiches for free on Thanksgiving in 2008. "I remember growing up and my mother was always feeding people who  were less fortunate," Brea once told Haitian movie site BelFim.com.  "My parents raised me to always share and to give charity in the name of God."]]></itunes:subtitle>

                MONDAY, Nov. 29 (HealthDay News) -- Eating disorders have risen steadily in children and teens over the last few decades, with some of the sharpest increases occurring in boys and minority youths, according to a new report. In one startling statistic cited in the report, an analysis by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that hospitalizations for  eating disorders jumped by 119 percent between 1999 and 2006 for  kids younger than 12. At the same time as severe cases of anorexia and bulimia have risen, so too have "partial-syndrome" eating disorders -- young people  who have some, but not all, of the symptoms of an eating disorder. Athletes, including gymnasts and wrestlers, and performers, including dancers and models, may be particularly at risk, according to the report. "We are seeing a lot more eating disorders than we used to and  we are seeing it in people we didn't associate with eating disorders in the past -- a lot of boys, little kids, people of color and those  with lower socioeconomic backgrounds," said report author  Dr. David Rosen, a professor of pediatrics, internal medicine and  psychiatry at University of Michigan.

Volunteers for the Phoenix Gay Lesbian Bisexual and Transgender Coalition for Mormon Action will gather at Pioneer Park, across the street from the temple and take to the public sidewalks around the temple at 5 p.m. to distribute outreach cards with the information for a suicide hotline. Bobby Parker, a Mormon and leader of the Phoenix GLBT Coalition,  said the group aims to make the Mormon community aware of both  The Trevor Project Suicide Prevention National Hotline  as well as Phoenix Affirmation , a local organization for gay Mormons. According to Parker, 400,000 Mormons are Arizona residents  and estimated that roughly 10 percent were gay or lesbian. Arizona&rsquo;s suicide rate is higher than the national average, Parker says. The group will also gather at 6:30 p.m. to hear speeches from  several people working to prevent suicides of homosexuals within the Mormon population. Following the evenings speeches, attendees plan to stand around  the temple with candles singing &ldquo;Silent Night&rdquo; before simultaneously blowing out the candles to represent the loss of the lives of those who have committed suicide.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Is marriage becoming obsolete?</strong></span><br /> By Stephanie Coontz, Special to CNN<br /><br /> <em>Editor's note: Stephanie Coontz teaches history and family studies at <br /> The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington, and is director of <br /> research and public education at the Council on Contemporary Families. <br /> Her latest book, "A Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and American <br /> Women at the Dawn of the 1960s," will be published in January by Basic Books.</em><br /><br /> (CNN) -- According to a TIME/Pew research poll released last week, <br /> 40 percent of Americans believe that marriage is becoming obsolete,<br /> up from just 28 percent in 1978.<br /><br /> In that same poll, only one in four unmarried Americans say they do <br /> not want to get married. And among currently married men and women, <br /> 80 percent say their marriage is as close as or closer than their parents' marriage.<br /><br /> These seemingly contradictory responses reflect the public's recognition <br /> of a new and complex reality. On the one hand, marriage as a voluntary <br /> relationship based on love and commitment is held in higher regard than <br /> ever, with more people saying that love is essential to marriage <br /> (Consider that in 1967, two-thirds of college women said they'd <br /> consider marrying a man they didn't love if he met other criteria, <br /> such as offering respectability and financial security.)<br /><br /> But as an institution that regulates people's lives, marriage is no <br /> longer the social and economic necessity it once was. People can <br /> construct successful lives outside marriage in ways that would <br /> have been very difficult to manage 50 years ago, and they have <br /> a far greater range of choices about whether to marry, when to marry,<br /> and how to organize their marriages.<br /><br /> This often makes them more cautious in committing to marriage and <br /> more picky about their partners than people were in the past.<br /><br /> In the 1950s, when half of all American women were already married <br /> in their teens, marriage was an almost mandatory first step toward <br /> adulthood. It was considered the best way to make a man grow up,<br /> and in an economy where steady jobs and rising real wages were <br /> widely available, that often worked.<br /><br /> For a woman, marriage was deemed the best investment she could <br /> make in her future, and in a world where even college-educated <br /> women earned less than men with a only a high school education, <br /> that often worked for her too.<br /><br /> Marriage was also supposed to be the only context in which people <br /> could regularly have sex or raise children. Divorced or unmarried<br /> men were routinely judged less qualified for bank loans or job<br /> promotions, sexually active single women were stigmatized, <br /> and out-of-wedlock children had few legal rights.<br /> Today, however, there are plenty of other ways to grow up, <br /> seek financial independence, and meet one's needs for <br /> companionship and sex. So what might have seemed a "good enough" <br /> reason to enter marriage in the past no longer seems sufficient to many people.<br /><br /> Marriage has become another step, perhaps even the final <br /> rather than the first step, in the transition to adulthood -- something <br /> many people will not even consider until they are very sure they are <br /> capable of taking their relationship to a higher plane.<br /><br /> Couples increasingly want to be certain, before they marry, <br /> that they can pay their bills, that neither party is burdened <br /> by debt, that each has a secure job or a set of skills attesting <br /> to their employability. Many are also conscious that as rigid<br /> gender roles erode, marriage demands more negotiation and <br /> relationship skills than in the past.<br /> They often want firsthand experience with how their partner <br /> will behave in an intimate relationship, which is why the <br /> majority of new marriages come after a period of cohabitation, <br /> according to census figures.<br /><br /> These higher expectations are good news for many marriages. <br /> People who can meet the high bar that most Americans now feel <br /> is appropriate for the transition to marriage -- people who delay <br /> marriage to get an education, who have accumulated a nest egg or<br /> established themselves in a secure line of work -- typically <br /> have higher quality marriages than other Americans, research <br /> shows, and their divorce rates have been falling for the past 25 years.<br /><br /> But these higher expectations pose difficulties for individuals <br /> with fewer interpersonal and material resources. Over the past 30 years, <br /> job opportunities and real wages have declined substantially for poorly<br /> educated men, making them less attractive marriage partners for women. <br /> When such men do find stable employment, they often tend to be more <br /> interested in a woman with good earnings prospects than someone they <br /> have to rescue from poverty.<br /><br /> Today, several studies have shown, economic instability is now more <br /> closely associated with marital distress than it used to be.<br /><br /> If a low-income woman finds a stable, employed partner, she will <br /> likely be better off by marrying.

			<title>Hookers For Jesus</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/hookers-for-jesus]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>'Hookers for Jesus' Tries to Save Las Vegas Prostitutes</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> Meet <strong>Annie Lobert</strong> -- a former prostitute with a singular mission: saving Las Vegas hookers. <br /><br /> Lobert, and her faith-based mission -- which she calls "Hookers for Jesus" -- are the focus of "Hookers: Saved on the Strip," a three-part series premiering Dec. 8 on Investigation Discovery. <br /><br /> "When I used to get arrested and the vice [cops] called me a 'hooker,' it really offended me," Lobert told The Post. "So one day I was thinking, if I was reaching out to women and starting to go into casinos and saying, 'I can help you change your life,' and calling myself Annie, it would be a weird thing -- 'Annie Lobert's Reach Out.' <br /><br /> "So I figured Hookers for Jesus. I believe in God, for one, and I was a hooker and now I go and fish for people [to save]." <br /><br /> TV cameras follow Lobert as she tries to teach ex-call girls how to turn their lives around. <br /><br /> In the show's premiere episode, Regina, who grew up in a middle-class New Jersey family and turned to prostitution while in the Navy (where she met her pimp), is her first project. <br /><br /> Lobert, 43, is from Minnesota. She worked as a Las Vegas hooker for over 10 years, finally leaving the life behind after a near-fatal overdose and repeated physical abuse from violent pimps. <br /><br /> She started Hookers for Jesus in 2006, and eventually began working with The Church of South Las Vegas, whose pastor, Benny Perez, helped Lobert start Destiny House -- a shelter for ex-prostitutes that helps prepare them for life in the straight world (finding jobs, apartments, etc.). <br /><br /></p>]]></description>

John McCain, whose threatened filibuster helped derail a <br /> Congressional repeal of the anti-gay law that bans open GLBTs from military <br /> service, not only faces criticism in the press for his stance; he&rsquo;s also at<br /> odds on the home front over the issue.<br /><br /> Both McCain&rsquo;s wife, Cindy, and his daughter, Meghan, have come out as strong <br /> supporters of efforts to repeal "Don&rsquo;t Ask, Don&rsquo;t Tell." <br /> Cindy McCain is featured in a video about GLBT youth suicide, <br /> speaking to the way in which "political and religious leaders" <br /> foster anti-gay oppression, "telling[ing] LGBT youth that <br /> they have no future." Adds McCain, "They can&rsquo;t serve our country openly."<br /> <br /><br /> Others in the video point out other avenues to legal equality and civic <br /> participation that are closed to sexual minorities, such as blood donation <br /> and federal recognition of their families. But Cindy McCain&rsquo;s line is <br /> especially pointed, given that her husband has not only refused to allow <br /> legislation to address the issue to move forward once--he&rsquo;s pressing to <br /> remove language that would set aside DADT from the Defense Authorization<br /> Bill Congress is expected to take up during the lame duck session, before <br /> a new Congress is sworn in. Unless that demand is met, McCain is prepared <br /> to carry through with his threatened filibuster.<br /> <br /><br /></p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Michael Jackson's 'Breaking News' hits the Web: What do you think of his new song?</strong><br /><br /> by Simon Vozick-Levinson<br /><br /><br /> The first single from Michael, the set of unreleased Michael Jackson recordings due Dec. 14, is streaming this morning from Jackson&rsquo;s official site as promised. It hasn&rsquo;t been made clear exactly to what degree &ldquo;Breaking News&rdquo; was completed after the King of Pop&rsquo;s 2009 death &mdash; some have even questioned whether Jackson actually sang on these tracks &mdash; and listening may or may not provide a final answer.<br /><br /> The track opens with a few staticky tabloid news headlines: &ldquo;The paparazzi would not leave him alone&hellip; Here we go again, another lawsuit for Michael Jackson&hellip; More allegations against him.&rdquo; In comes a tight new jack swing beat, &agrave; la 1991&prime;s Dangerous, followed by some angry, half-whispered lead vocals that remind me more of 1995&prime;s HIStory. &ldquo;Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson,&rdquo; he hisses, presciently adding after a few lines, &rdquo;They want to write my obituary.&rdquo; Later on he reaches the chorus: &ldquo;Why is it strange that I would fall in love?/Who is the boogieman you&rsquo;re thinking of?&rdquo;<br /><br /> The theme of lashing out at the press is vintage Jackson, dating back at least to 1987&prime;s &ldquo;Leave Me Alone.&rdquo; Aside from that, the melody here feels second-rate, with echoes of his own &ldquo;Who Is It&rdquo; and (to my ears, in the descending verses) Bobby Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;My Prerogative.&rdquo; This probably shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise. Jackson chose to leave &ldquo;Breaking News&rdquo; unfinished in his vaults for a reason. But dedicated fans will no doubt appreciate the chance to hear even these warmed-over leftovers.<br /><br /> What do you think of &ldquo;Breaking News&rdquo;? Will you be buying Michael next month?<br /><br /><br /><br /> <strong>Michael Jackson's new single: Is that really him singing? </strong><br /> by Simon Vozick-Levinson<br /><br /><br /> The Internet is abuzz with speculation about just how many of Michael Jackson&lsquo;s original vocals ended up on Michael, his upcoming album of unreleased material. Those rumors heated up today with the release of &ldquo;Breaking News,&rdquo; the first single from the album.<br /><br /> Some fans are convinced that the lead vocals on &ldquo;Breaking News,&rdquo; particularly during the verses, don&rsquo;t sound enough like the late legend they remember. Others feel that perhaps Jackson was just using a different vocal timbre than usual.<br /><br /> Jackson&rsquo;s label has acknowledged that at least some of the tracks on Michael were brought to completion after his death last year. Beyond that, specifics on these recording sessions are hard to come by, so it&rsquo;s an open question for now.<br /><br /> Visit Jackson&rsquo;s official site (http://breakingnews.michaeljackson.com/) to hear &ldquo;Breaking News&rdquo;</p>]]></description>

                <p><br />Susan Brock, the wife of Maricopa County Supervisor Fulton Brock in Arizona, was in court on Wednesday on charges of sexual molestation. She is also charged with sexual conduct with a minor, and is being held without bond, Fox Phoenix reports.<br /><br /> The victim, currently 17 years old, admitted to his parents that sexual activity was occurring between himself and Brock, 48. It was then that the Chandler Police Department was notified of the relationship by the parents. Police say the two did not engage in sexual intercourse.<br /><br /> The parents showed police printouts of sexually explicit messages exchanged between Brock and the teen, as well as the messages on iPod Touch, which was given to the teen by Brock. Over the years, the teen said they have had about 20 or 30 sexual encounters.<br /><br /> The teen explained that the two had been engaged in such activity since he was 14 years old.  He said that she would pick him up from school or from home and they would go to secluded areas where they wouldn&rsquo;t be found.<br /><br /> Brock would also help the boy meet with his girlfriend, also a minor, who was forbidden to see the boy. Brock enabled the two to meet and have sex, providing transportation and even condoms.<br /><br /> Brock made her court appearance Wednesday morning. A status hearing has been scheduled for November 3, and a preliminary hearing on November 8.<br /><br />Read more: http://www.thirdage.com/news/susan-brock-charged-child-molestation_10-28-2010#ixzz13m1aYQqe</p>

                Susan Brock, the wife of Maricopa County Supervisor Fulton Brock in Arizona, was in court on Wednesday on charges of sexual molestation. She is also charged with sexual conduct with a minor, and is being held without bond, Fox Phoenix reports. The victim, currently 17 years old, admitted to his parents that sexual activity was occurring between himself and Brock, 48. It was then that the Chandler Police Department was notified of the relationship by the parents. Police say the two did not engage in sexual intercourse. The parents showed police printouts of sexually explicit messages exchanged between Brock and the teen, as well as the messages on iPod Touch, which was given to the teen by Brock. Over the years, the teen said they have had about 20 or 30 sexual encounters. The teen explained that the two had been engaged in such activity since he was 14 years old.  He said that she would pick him up from school or from home and they would go to secluded areas where they wouldn&rsquo;t be found. Brock would also help the boy meet with his girlfriend, also a minor, who was forbidden to see the boy. Brock enabled the two to meet and have sex, providing transportation and even condoms. Brock made her court appearance Wednesday morning. A status hearing has been scheduled for November 3, and a preliminary hearing on November 8.Read more: http://www.thirdage.com/news/susan-brock-charged-child-molestation_10-28-2010#ixzz13m1aYQqe

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p><strong>10 Things Employment Recruiters Won't Say</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /> <strong>1. &ldquo;There are better ways to find a job.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> A recruiter or agency is one part of a job search, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be your primary source &ndash; and maybe not your secondary one, either. Referrals &ndash; that is, a connection made by someone you know &ndash; remain your best bet. CareerXRoads&rsquo; annual survey of more than 200 employers shows that the percentage of hires made through referrals has remained remarkably consistent over the last five years. Nearly 27% of respondents said referrals were the biggest factor in external hires in 2009, practically unchanged from its 27.1% figure in 2005. Third-party agencies, meanwhile, accounted for only 2.3% of external hires last year, compared to a 5.2% success rate in 2005.<br /><br /> <strong>2. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t work for you.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Christy Ezelle, a media advertising executive in New York, was in her first job out of college when she got a call from a headhunter working for a major advertising agency. It was a good experience, until she tried to negotiate her salary &ndash; the company wouldn&rsquo;t budge. Why? They had already shelled out for the headhunter that tracked her down &ndash; a fee that was eating into the amount they were willing to pay Ezelle. Recruiters work for the hiring company, and that&rsquo;s where their allegiance lies &ndash; not with the job-seeker. That means headhunters will always be more interested in making their client happy than in finding a candidate the best possible package, says Carolyn Dougherty, an executive search consultant in Villanova, Penn. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a belief that the recruiter is working on the candidate&rsquo;s behalf and that&rsquo;s not the case,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re working for the client &ndash; that&rsquo;s where the fee is coming from.&rdquo; And because most recruiters don&rsquo;t get paid until the position gets filled, they care more about sealing the deal than about getting you another $10,000.<br /><br /> <strong>3. &ldquo;Until a year ago, I was a car salesman.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> There are no laws or rules that govern what constitutes an &ldquo;employment agency&rdquo; or who can call himself a recruiter, and setting up shop is pretty easy: A year&rsquo;s worth of advertising, office space, travel and communications equipment is just $50,000 for an experienced recruiter like Eleanor Sweet, who runs the Remington Group in Barrington, Ill., an hour outside of Chicago; a rookie could put out a shingle for far less. Anyone can do it, she says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty much like getting a real estate license.&rdquo; That means job seekers have to vet a recruiter with the same diligence they&rsquo;d investigate a potential employer. Ask how long the recruiter&rsquo;s been in the business, and where they&rsquo;ve placed candidates in the past &ndash; and then call those companies and confirm, experts advise. Also, though a certification isn&rsquo;t required to be a recruiter, there are a handful of designations a pro can earn. Getting certified as a Temporary Staffing Specialist, a Personnel Consultant, or a Professional in Human Resources don&rsquo;t require any coursework, but all require previous experience and the passage of an exam &ndash; legitimate hoops for a dedicated professional to jump through. One strategy to avoid at all costs: firms that charge for job search services or call themselves &ldquo;fee-based counselors&rdquo; raise red flags with experienced recruiters, because &ldquo;It&rsquo;s expected that the company pays the fee,&rdquo; says Dougherty. (see No. 2, above).<br /><br /> <strong>4. &ldquo;The job we advertised may not exist.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Recruiters often advertise appealing jobs that aren&rsquo;t vacant, just to build up a stable of candidates, says Nick Corcodilos, who heads the executive search firm North Bridge Group and runsw ww.asktheheadhunter.com4 in Lebanon, N.J. From a staffing firm or recruiter&rsquo;s perspective, this is a practical way to do business, because many assignments offer a bonus for filling a key job fast. But for the job hunter, it&rsquo;s misleading, raising false hopes at an already anxious time. That doesn&rsquo;t mean an applicant&rsquo;s efforts are useless. Just because there&rsquo;s no job now doesn&rsquo;t mean there won&rsquo;t be one in a few months. Jeremy Dixon, general manager at A-1 Temps in Tampa, says client companies will ask him for 50 people qualified for customer service positions &ldquo;in a couple of weeks.&rdquo; If he has a sufficient pool of established applicants, he can place them in a hurry. For the best odds of success, job-seekers should identify companies and positions they&rsquo;re specifically interested in and seek out recruiters who work with them. (This is particularly true for anyone seeking an upper management job, for which companies typically rely on an established relationship with a recruiter or recruiting firm.)<br /><br /> <strong>5. &ldquo;We already know quite a bit about you.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> As soon as you sign up with a recruiter or search firm, they check you out &ndash; your background, your credit history, even legal records. That&rsquo;s why they have applicants sign all those disclosures. If you want to work with them, you have to submit. That&rsquo;s fairly standard in the job market these days, whether or not you work with a recruiter, but unlike a recruiter, a prospective employer usually doesn&rsquo;t do the background check until after he&rsquo;s met you. That gives a candidate the opportunity to impress on his merits, and explain anything that might be dodgy in his history. Working through a recruiter, a job seeker might never get that chance. In that case, all you can do is make sure that the information they have is accurate, says Corcodilos. Almost 80 percent of credit reports contain errors, and 25 percent have what&rsquo;s considered to be a &ldquo;serious error&rdquo; such as false delinquencies or accounts that did not belong to the consumer, according to a 2004 study fromU .S. PIRG5. To ensure you&rsquo;ll be judged on your own merits, check your credit report for errors and take steps to fix what you find 6.<br /><br /> <strong>6. &ldquo;Our jobs aren&rsquo;t so hot either.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Because most agencies don&rsquo;t get paid unless they place candidates at jobs, the weak labor market has taken its toll. In Orange County, Calif., for example, the 20 largest employment firms saw revenue drop almost 20% in 2009, prompting many to lay off employees, according to an Orange County Business Journal survey. A lot of experienced people have left the field, says Darrel Gurney, an independent career consultant who runs the CareerGuy.com web site, leaving &ldquo;empty desks and brand spanking new people who have never done this before.&rdquo; That means you often don&rsquo;t get the best help in your job search, particularly working with smaller firms, he says. Bigger, national and international firms are doing better. Revenue at Switzerland&rsquo;s Adecco, the world&rsquo;s largest staffing company, rose 16% in July and August. Meanwhile, revenues at domestic search firms Manpower (MAN 7) and Robert Half International (RHI 8) are up 15% and 6% respectively in the last three months, in part a result of an increase in revenue-producing job placements.<br /><br /> <strong>7. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re at the mercy of a computer, just like online job board users.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> The rise of online job sites like Monster (MWW 9) and Careerbuilder has changed the way many staffing professionals work. The sites use computer programs to scan applications for particular keywords &ndash; and now, so do recruiters. Even if you submit your resume on fancy stationery, it gets scanned by the recruiter or staffing agency. Especially for entry or mid-level jobs, cover letters don&rsquo;t get read, Gurney says: It&rsquo;s this digital process that drives the professional match-making. To get through the computer gatekeeper, applicants need to make sure the relevant, searchable words are on their resumes. For example, he says, if you want to work in the entertainment industry, listing a past job at Sony Pictures on your resume isn&rsquo;t enough; the word &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; must be there too. Candidates who aren&rsquo;t sure what the magic keywords are should look at the description of the job they&rsquo;re applying for, says Jessica Mazor, an account manager for the accounting and finance business at Kforce Professional Staffin g(KFRC10) in New York. The &ldquo;must have&rdquo; criteria in the description are particularly important.<br /><br /> <strong>8. &ldquo;The &lsquo;temp-to-perm&rsquo; carrot is rotten.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Many staffing agencies hold out the promise of permanent jobs after success in a temporary position, but that trend isn&rsquo;t holding in this recovery. Since temporary Published October 25, 2010 Related articles and videos Where to Find a Good Job During the Holidays1 Job Seekers: How to Negotiate a Higher Offer 2 Age Bias at Work: Should You Sue?3 employment trends hit bottom in September 2009, the U.S. Department of Labor says the service and professional sectors have added 392,000 temporary jobs. But the CareerXroads survey showed that positions explicitly advertised as temp-to-perm accounted for just 1.6% of all hiring in 2009 &ndash; and even in better times, that rate was only around 3%. &ldquo;Temp-to-perm is basically a marketing ploy,&rdquo; says Corcodilos, who says it&rsquo;s really more of a fantasy: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s what recruiters would like to see happen.&rdquo;<br /><br /> <strong>9. &ldquo;If you have a job, I could get you fired.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> Not all recruiters are careful, and the last thing you want is to have your resume land on the desk of your current boss. This is a very real risk, says Sweet, president of the Remington Group, so job seekers need to make sure they know exactly what recruiters are doing on their behalf. &ldquo;Put every recruiter you work with on notice,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Say, &lsquo;You do not have permission to release my paperwork without my permission.&rdquo; And then there are the aggressive recruiters who pull resumes off LinkedIn profiles and job boards and circulate them without getting the candidates permission &ndash; or even letting him know. That&rsquo;s what happened to Michael Segel, an information consultant in Chicago, who was interviewing with several different companies when one prospective employer asked him why he&rsquo;d received his resume twice. An overzealous recruiter whom Segal had never met had sent it. Now Segal only posts his resume as an un-alterable PDF, and he keeps careful track of where he and any recruiters he&rsquo;s working with send it. He says it can&rsquo;t stop the practice of unauthorized circulation, but if he&rsquo;s contacted by a recruiter he doesn&rsquo;t know, he can quickly figure out what&rsquo;s happened. &ldquo;I usually cut off contact right there,&rdquo; he says.<br /><br /> <strong>10. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m in Virginia, I probably won&rsquo;t help you find a job in Nebraska.&rdquo;</strong><br /><br /> If you&rsquo;re willing to relocate, don&rsquo;t rely on your contact in your home city to help you find work outside the area &mdash; even if you&rsquo;re working with a national search firm. Recruiters at big firms have little incentive to spread your resume around to other locations; they&rsquo;ll have to split a commission with the colleague that helps you land a job. Instead, send your resume to the branch offices in the places you would like to go. As soon as that office has you on file, &ldquo;they take ownership of your search,&rdquo; says Sweet. Smaller, more local firms agree &ndash; and may even refer you to someone else. &ldquo;We have alliances with other staffing companies,&rdquo; says Diana Wall, a senior account manager at Accel Financial Staffing in Oklahoma City. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no commission &ndash; it&rsquo;s all friendly referrals.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>The state of California's recent step toward fully decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of marijuana with Prop 19 has reignited one of the more contentious flash points in modern society&mdash;where, if anywhere, marijuana has a place.<br /><br /> Few things illustrate the controversy better than a comparison of the web pages that purport to separate myth from fact published by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Drug Policy Alliance (DPA). They are almost mirror images of one another, addressing the very same points, but drawing on different studies to reach their preferred conclusions. It's stunning to see how differently these agencies can interpret the same information. <br /><br /> There is a single salvation from this cherry-picking point-counterpoint: the seminal report "Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base." This comprehensive summary of marijuana was written in 1999 by the most highly regarded nongovernmental medical organization in the country, the Institute of Medicine, and it serves as the primary source for the information in this article concerning the risks and benefits of marijuana. <br /><br /> <strong>Health Risk Myths &amp; Realities</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> The essential questions are whether the active ingredient in marijuana, a cannabinoid (chemical compound) known as THC, has any medicinal value; whether the risks associated with its use outweigh the benefits; and whether THC answers a need not currently met by any other medications on the market. In the course of that debate, several health risks are often cited: <br /><br /> <strong>Marijuana overdose</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> There is no existing evidence of anyone dying of a marijuana overdose, but this doesn't preclude the possibility of experiencing adverse or unpleasant effects when it is consumed in large amounts. For comparison's sake, alcohol overdoses claim approximately 5,000 casualties per year.This is often cited as a reason that marijuana is safer than other drugs, like alcohol. <br /><br /> <strong>Memory</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> Marijuana does impair short-term memory, but only during intoxication. THC has been shown to have a negative effect on memory, and chronic abuse of marijuana will cause permanent impairment. <br /><br /> <strong>Addiction</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> The DEA's general opposition to marijuana is comprised of 1) that whatever medical value it has is already fulfilled by other, equally effective drugs on the market, and 2) that marijuana is highly addictive. <br /><br /> Both points can be turned upside down: There is already an abundance of drugs that do the same job as products already on the market, and they receive approval anyway. This seems to run contrary to the DEA's first argument. And even a cursory look at many of the Schedule II opiates and amphetamines shows that high addiction potential is not a basis for legal classification of drugs. The point is that marijuana is not physically addictive, and even if it was, the DEA would appear to be quite hypocritical arguing this point. <br /><br /> <strong>The immune system</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> If smoked marijuana were to inhibit the activity of T-lymphocytes in the blood, it would compromise the body's ability to fight infection. This would put some people at the mercy of opportunistic infections and diseases, notably those who have immunosuppressive conditions like HIV or lymphoma. <br /><br /> However, the data does not support this. What it does support -- barely -- is the compromised immunity of the lungs due to the smoke from marijuana. <br /><br /> <strong>Heart problems</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> It is accepted in medical circles today that marijuana use causes no evident long-term cardiovascular problems for normal persons. The DEA aggressively goes after this point, claiming that according to Harvard researchers, in the hour after having smoked marijuana, one's heart attack risk goes up five fold. However, this 'fact' is not properly cited and is indicative of the DEA's sloppy attempts to cite its sources. Marijuana's effects on blood pressure are complex and inconsistent as of yet. <br /><br /> <strong>Cancer</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> Is THC considered a carcinogen (cancer-causing) in humans? Not according to the two most esteemed agencies of relevance, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP). However, the same cannot be said for smoking marijuana, as the smoke from burning marijuana shares an array of dangerous and potentially carcinogenic chemicals with cigarette smoke. The DPA fumbles here, saying "there have been no reports of lung cancer related solely to marijuana," subtly hinting that it's even possible to determine causation for any cancer in the first place. It should be said that although the DPA's information is generally more reliable than the DEA&rsquo;s, it does contain its fair share of porous arguments. <br /><br /> <strong>The gateway effect</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> Does marijuana use lead to harder drugs? Most long-term studies show that those people who report having tried disparate drugs like cocaine and heroin often share a history of having smoked marijuana. However, the implication that marijuana causes people to try harder drugs is as yet unproven, and indeed it may act as an alternative to more dangerous drugs. <br /><br /> <strong>Potential benefits</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> No serious proponent of medicinal marijuana would claim it cures anything. Marijuana does, however, treat symptoms -- pain, nausea -- that are caused by a wide range of illnesses. <br /><br /> <strong>Pain management</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> The receptors in the brain that allow uptake of cannabinoids (like THC) are actually part of the most widespread receptor system in the body. Not only is the body naturally attuned to these molecules, it also uses them to great effect -- numerous studies have established that cannabinoids help reduce pain and other distressing symptoms. <br /><br /> <strong>Antiemesis</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> Some chemotherapy regimens are notorious for causing terrible bouts of nausea and vomiting, and both THC and marijuana have been explored as antiemetic (antinausea) medication. Smoking marijuana does give the desired effect in a matter of minutes and could, therefore, relieve the symptom quickly. <br /><br /> <strong>The potential drawback</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> If marijuana becomes fully legalized in plant form and open to commercialization -- a stance largely supported by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) -- one notoriously vile group of manufacturers is uniquely poised better than any other to take control of the emerging market: Big Tobacco. Having fully established its disinterest in the public health generations ago by the shady promotion of smoking, the idea of Big Tobacco becoming the nation's pot supplier should frighten anyone favoring legalization and regulation. <br /><br /> <strong>Still much to learn</strong> <br /><br /><br /><br /> The dearth of useful clinical trial data&mdash;randomized, controlled, double-blind trials involving large patient populations&mdash;is the biggest hurdle facing marijuana's legitimacy. While numerous smaller tests have been performed that support both sides of the health argument, political and economic reasons will form the primary impetus for the legalization of marijuana. For a state like California, whose budget deficit amounts to billions of dollars, the potential tax revenue from legalized marijuana is a lot of money that is currently going up in smoke. <br /><br /><br /><br /> http://www.foxnews.com/health/2010/10/19/benefits-marijuana/</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Published October 20, 2010 | FoxNews.com<br /><br /> At least four gays have been attacked in Uganda since the publication of a front-page newspaper story that listed the African nation's 100 "top" homosexuals, according to activists there.<br /><br /> The Oct. 9 article in a Ugandan newspaper called Rolling Stone included photographs and addresses of the 100 individuals alongside a yellow banner that read: "Hang Them."<br /><br /> Rolling Stone, which is not connected to the American magazine of the same name, claimed that an unknown but deadly disease was attacking homosexuals in Uganda and that gays were recruiting 1 million children by raiding schools -- a popular rumor in the nation.<br /><br /> "100 Pictures of Uganda's Top Homos Leak," the newspaper's headline read.<br /><br /> Charles Ssentongo, deputy chief of the Republic of Uganda's embassy in Washington, told FoxNews.com that embassy officials had not seen the article as of Wednesday.<br /><br /> "We are not aware of that list, nor do we have anything to do with it," Ssentongo told FoxNews.com. <br /><br /> He said all Ugandan citizens -- regardless of sexual orientation -- deserve equal rights and protection. He declined further comment, since he had not seen the article. <br /><br /> In the weeks since the article was published, at least four of the people on the list have been attacked and many others are hiding, Ugandan civil rights activist Julian Onziema told the Associated Press. <br /><br /> A lawmaker in the country introduced a bill last year that would have imposed the death penalty for some homosexual acts and life in prison for others. The bill was shelved after it was condemned throughout the world, but gays in Uganda say they have faced a year of harassment and attacks since it was introduced. The legislation was proposed after a visit by leaders of U.S. conservative Christian ministries that promote therapy they say enables gays to become heterosexual. <br /><br /> "Before the introduction of the bill in parliament most people did not mind about our activities. But since then, we are harassed by many people who hate homosexuality," Patrick Ndede, 27, told the Associated Press. "The publicity the bill got made many people come to know about us and they started mistreating us." <br /><br /> More than 20 homosexuals have been attacked over the last year in Uganda, and an additional 17 have been arrested and are in prison, said Frank Mugisha, the chairman of Sexual Minorities Uganda. Those numbers are up from the same period two years ago, when roughly 10 homosexuals were attacked, he said. <br /><br /> The Oct. 9 newspaper article appeared five days before the first anniversary of the controversial legislation. After its publication, the government Media Council ordered the newspaper to cease publishing -- not because of the newspaper's content, but because the newspaper had not registered with the government. After it completes the paperwork, Rolling Stone will be free to publish again, said Paul Mukasa, secretary of the Media Council. <br /><br /> That decision has angered the gay community further. Onziema said a lawsuit against Rolling Stone is in the works, and that she believes the publication has submitted its registration and plans to publish again. <br /><br /> "Such kind of media should not be allowed in Uganda. It is creating violence and calling for genocide of sex minorities," Mugisha said. "The law enforcers and government should come out and protect sex minorities from such media." <br /><br /> Rolling Stone does not have a large following in Uganda, a country of 32 million whose population is about 85 percent Christian and 12 percent Muslim.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Published October 20, 2010 | FoxNews.com At least four gays have been attacked in Uganda since the publication of a front-page newspaper story that listed the African nation's 100 "top" homosexuals, according to activists there. The Oct. 9 article in a Ugandan newspaper called Rolling Stone included photographs and addresses of the 100 individuals alongside a yellow banner that read: "Hang Them." Rolling Stone, which is not connected to the American magazine of the same name, claimed that an unknown but deadly disease was attacking homosexuals in Uganda and that gays were recruiting 1 million children by raiding schools -- a popular rumor in the nation. "100 Pictures of Uganda's Top Homos Leak," the newspaper's headline read. Charles Ssentongo, deputy chief of the Republic of Uganda's embassy in Washington, told FoxNews.com that embassy officials had not seen the article as of Wednesday. "We are not aware of that list, nor do we have anything to do with it," Ssentongo told FoxNews.com.  He said all Ugandan citizens -- regardless of sexual orientation -- deserve equal rights and protection. He declined further comment, since he had not seen the article.  In the weeks since the article was published, at least four of the people on the list have been attacked and many others are hiding, Ugandan civil rights activist Julian Onziema told the Associated Press.  A lawmaker in the country introduced a bill last year that would have imposed the death penalty for some homosexual acts and life in prison for others. The bill was shelved after it was condemned throughout the world, but gays in Uganda say they have faced a year of harassment and attacks since it was introduced. The legislation was proposed after a visit by leaders of U.S. conservative Christian ministries that promote therapy they say enables gays to become heterosexual.  "Before the introduction of the bill in parliament most people did not mind about our activities. But since then, we are harassed by many people who hate homosexuality," Patrick Ndede, 27, told the Associated Press. "The publicity the bill got made many people come to know about us and they started mistreating us."  More than 20 homosexuals have been attacked over the last year in Uganda, and an additional 17 have been arrested and are in prison, said Frank Mugisha, the chairman of Sexual Minorities Uganda. Those numbers are up from the same period two years ago, when roughly 10 homosexuals were attacked, he said.  The Oct. 9 newspaper article appeared five days before the first anniversary of the controversial legislation. After its publication, the government Media Council ordered the newspaper to cease publishing -- not because of the newspaper's content, but because the newspaper had not registered with the government. After it completes the paperwork, Rolling Stone will be free to publish again, said Paul Mukasa, secretary of the Media Council.  That decision has angered the gay community further. Onziema said a lawsuit against Rolling Stone is in the works, and that she believes the publication has submitted its registration and plans to publish again.  "Such kind of media should not be allowed in Uganda. It is creating violence and calling for genocide of sex minorities," Mugisha said. "The law enforcers and government should come out and protect sex minorities from such media."  Rolling Stone does not have a large following in Uganda, a country of 32 million whose population is about 85 percent Christian and 12 percent Muslim. The newspaper published its first edition on Aug. 23. It publishes about 2,000 copies, but a single newspaper in Uganda is often read by 10 more people.  The paper's managing editor, Giles Muhame, said the article was "in the public interest."  "We felt there was need for society to know that such characters exist amongst them. Some of them recruit young children into homosexuality, which is bad and need to be exposed," he said. "They take advantage of poverty to recruit Ugandans. In brief, we did so because homosexuality is illegal, unacceptable and insults our traditional lifestyle."  Homophobia is rife in many African countries, particularly in Nigeria, where homosexuality is punishable by death or imprisonment.

In South Africa, the only African nation to recognize gay marriage, gangs are known to carry out so-called "corrective" rapes on lesbians.

                <p><strong>Cyberbullying, gay bashing, and parental to-dos</strong><br /><br /> by reneeschaferhorton on Oct. 12, 2010, under Life, Media, Parenting<br /> <br /><br /> There are certain things that I cannot wrap my mind around, no matter how hard I try, and believe me, I do try. I struggle mightily to see all sides of an issue, but sometimes, it turns out there is only one side: the right one. When children are killing themselves, something has gone terribly, horribly wrong and, being the ever helpful person I am, I&rsquo;m going to say that that &ldquo;something&rdquo; is technology. And, to a certain extent, a lack of parental involvement in this digital generation. Stay with me, class, while I explain.<br /><br /> I lived through adolescence, and I remember the terror of being picked on and made the butt of jokes. Many &ndash; if not most &ndash; kids are cruel when in a pack (ala compulsory schooling), and the kids in my high school were no different. I saw the issue again as I raised my own children, some of whom were bullied in middle or high school. And now, as a student teacher in a high school, I see this water torture of life up close and personal once again as students shun, ostracize or joke about various classmates. As they say, some things never change. Unless, of course, you add some social networks and iPhones and web-cams so the bullying and terrorizing can be all the more horrific. <br /><br /> The recent suicides of Seth Walsh, 13, Asher Brown, 13, Billy Lucas, 15 and Tyler Clementi, 18, are all attributed to gay-bashing. Their tormenters believed the young men were gay and used that as a reason to terrorize them in the hallways, locker rooms and cafeterias of their schools. In the case of Clementi, the terrorizing was spread to the Internet, when his stupid (can I call a spade a spade? roommate webcammed Clementi making out with a man in his Rutgers dorm room and (surprise!) streamed it live. Two days later, Clementi jumped to his death off a bridge over the Hudson River. <br /><br /> What kind of horrible person web cams his roommate&rsquo;s sexual encounter and streams it online? The kind of young man who no doubt teased guys like Walsh, Brown and Lucas in hallways and cafeterias in middle and high school. The kind of young man who was never stopped in a school yard by a teacher or principal when he or she called someone &ldquo;fag&rdquo; or &ldquo;homo.&rdquo; The kind of young man who didn&rsquo;t hear enough lectures at home about respect for ALL human beings. And, perhaps most tellingly, the kind of young man who is a product of the digital generation that sees nothing as private and lives for their next Face Book status update. The kind of young man brought up in a culture of YouTube, which is just as likely to have &ldquo;lets make fun of her&rdquo; clips streamed as it is to have cute videos of babies and kittens. The kind of young man who has been so surrounded by technology that he&rsquo;s lost the ability to think, &ldquo;Would I want someone to do this to me?&rdquo; in regard to fellow human beings. <br /><br /> Remember Phoebe Prince? She wasn&rsquo;t tormented for being gay, but she was tormented through technology. Or Alexis Pilkington? Tormented to death with technology. The latest rash of teen suicides are attributed to the terrorizing of young gay men &ndash; treating them as something &ldquo;less than&rdquo; their tormenters &ndash; but this lack of respect for other humans crosses sexual, racial and religious boundaries. It is everywhere, all the time, as close as the next iPhone. And it is time parents did something about it. <br /><br /> So here&rsquo;s your free parenting advice for the day: Turn off the darn TV &ndash; especially the one in the back seat of your car that you keep on to keep your kids quiet. Go to your computer and pull up the news about these recent deaths and have a come to Jesus meeting about what is happening in your child&rsquo;s school. Have your child login to his/her social network sites and read what is being posted there. Then ask for their cell phone and read their text messages &ndash; incoming and outgoing. Figure out if you&rsquo;ve got a little cyberbully in your house or if your child is being bullied by others. Do not think your child will tell you if he or she is being bullied &ndash; that rarely happens. And if he or she is being bullied, force the school to deal with it or go to the school board. <br /><br /> On the other hand, don&rsquo;t think your child necessarily knows that he or she should not send that nasty text message about the oddball kid at school. They have to be taught how to be kind and loving to each other, they have to be asked &ldquo;Would you like it &hellip;&rdquo; questions to develop their sense of empathy. Discuss why it is wrong to say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so gay&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a loser.&rdquo; <br /><br /> In otherwords, do not assume children can raise themselves. They have parents for a reason. Be the grown up in your house &ndash; take responsibility for what your children do and look into what might be happening to them. And, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, if your child is gay (or you suspect they are), keep loving them. They have a hard row to hoe in high school and they need you to help them make it. If you think you&rsquo;d have issues with having a gay child, get yourself some help through a GLBT family group so your child can have the support he or she needs. Finally, teach respect for ever human being in everything you do and say. <br /><br /> That, ladies and gentlemen, is our job as parents: To be good examples, to know what is happening in our kids&rsquo; lives and to make sure they are behaving as caring, decent human beings &ndash; iPhones and webcams or no. Phoebe Prince, Seth Walsh, Asher Brown, Alexis Pilkington, Billy Lucas, and Tyler Clementi were human beings deserving of the same respect you and your children deserve. Make sure your kids know &ndash; and act &ndash; on that information.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

They have to be taught how to be kind and loving to each other, they have to be asked &ldquo;Would you like it &hellip;&rdquo; questions to develop their sense of empathy. Discuss why it is wrong to say, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so gay&rdquo; or &ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a loser.&rdquo;  In otherwords, do not assume children can raise themselves. They have parents for a reason. Be the grown up in your house &ndash; take responsibility for what your children do and look into what might be happening to them. And, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, if your child is gay (or you suspect they are), keep loving them. They have a hard row to hoe in high school and they need you to help them make it. If you think you&rsquo;d have issues with having a gay child, get yourself some help through a GLBT family group so your child can have the support he or she needs. Finally, teach respect for ever human being in everything you do and say.  That, ladies and gentlemen, is our job as parents: To be good examples, to know what is happening in our kids&rsquo; lives and to make sure they are behaving as caring, decent human beings &ndash; iPhones and webcams or no. Phoebe Prince, Seth Walsh, Asher Brown, Alexis Pilkington, Billy Lucas, and Tyler Clementi were human beings deserving of the same respect you and your children deserve. Make sure your kids know &ndash; and act &ndash; on that information.

			<title>Secrets For Glowing Skin</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/secrets-for-glowing-skin]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>By Liesa Goins<br /><br /> Look sun-kissed <br /> "A little tint takes years off your face by evening out your skin tone," which a recent study found is a key marker of youthfulness, says Ranella Hirsch, M.D., a dermatologist in Cambridge, MA. Her favorite for a natural look: Olay Complete Touch of Sun Daily UV Moisturizer + A Touch of Sunless Tanner ($15; drugstores), a lotion with a low level of self-tanner.<br /><br /> Eat a skin-saving breakfast<br /> The first meal of the day for New York City derm Doris Day, M.D., includes almonds. "They contain essential fatty acids, which help put the brakes on inflammation that accelerates fine lines, sagging and blotchiness." Not feeling like a nut? Salmon, tuna and halibut are good lunch/dinner sources.<br /><br /> Spray away dryness <br /> To keep her skin supple, L.A.-based derm Jessica Wu, M.D., sprays it several times daily with La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring Water ($8.50; drugstores). (She often spritzes her face when stuck in traffic!) Bonus: The water is packed with minerals like selenium that protect against UV damage.<br /><br /> Pour on the protection <br /> To ensure she layers on enough sunscreen ("the best way to keep skin youthful"), Garland, TX-based dermatologist Lisa Garner, M.D., president of the Women's Dermatologic Society, fills the hollow of her palm (about &frac12; teaspoon) with a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher to coat her face, neck and ears.<br /><br /> "I usually have to apply two coats to finish what I've squeezed out, but that's how I make sure I'm covered."<br /><br /> Zen your skin <br /> If anyone has stress, it's doctors. High levels of tension can spike hormone production that leads to breakouts or aggravates conditions like psoriasis. "Controlling stress keeps your skin calm &mdash; but that's easier said than done," says Annie Chiu, M.D., a derm in L.A. Taking a 10-minute time-out to apply a face mask and relax on her bed works for Chiu. Another trick: Ban the 'Berry. "I turn off my cell phone after 8 at night.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[By Liesa Goins Look sun-kissed  "A little tint takes years off your face by evening out your skin tone," which a recent study found is a key marker of youthfulness, says Ranella Hirsch, M.D., a dermatologist in Cambridge, MA. Her favorite for a natural look: Olay Complete Touch of Sun Daily UV Moisturizer + A Touch of Sunless Tanner ($15; drugstores), a lotion with a low level of self-tanner. Eat a skin-saving breakfast The first meal of the day for New York City derm Doris Day, M.D., includes almonds. "They contain essential fatty acids, which help put the brakes on inflammation that accelerates fine lines, sagging and blotchiness." Not feeling like a nut? Salmon, tuna and halibut are good lunch/dinner sources. Spray away dryness  To keep her skin supple, L.A.-based derm Jessica Wu, M.D., sprays it several times daily with La Roche-Posay Thermal Spring Water ($8.50; drugstores). (She often spritzes her face when stuck in traffic!) Bonus: The water is packed with minerals like selenium that protect against UV damage. Pour on the protection  To ensure she layers on enough sunscreen ("the best way to keep skin youthful"), Garland, TX-based dermatologist Lisa Garner, M.D., president of the Women's Dermatologic Society, fills the hollow of her palm (about &frac12; teaspoon) with a broad spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher to coat her face, neck and ears. "I usually have to apply two coats to finish what I've squeezed out, but that's how I make sure I'm covered." Zen your skin  If anyone has stress, it's doctors. High levels of tension can spike hormone production that leads to breakouts or aggravates conditions like psoriasis. "Controlling stress keeps your skin calm &mdash; but that's easier said than done," says Annie Chiu, M.D., a derm in L.A. Taking a 10-minute time-out to apply a face mask and relax on her bed works for Chiu. Another trick: Ban the 'Berry. "I turn off my cell phone after 8 at night. Every little bit helps!" she says. Protect with powder  Sunscreen stops working in less than 3 hours, so reapplication is key, says Washington, D.C.-based derm Elizabeth Tanzi, M.D. For easy touch-ups, she uses powder sunscreen. "It's light, so makeup stays intact." Her fave: Colorescience Pro Sunforgettable Powder SPF 50 ($60; colorescience.com).

			<title>Engineers Slam Internet 'Censorship' Bill Under Review by Senate</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/engineers-slam-internet-censorship-bill-under-review-by-senate]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>By Judson Berger<br /> Published September 29, 2010 | FoxNews.com<br /><br /> Internet entrepreneurs are in a panic over a Senate bill they say will censor the Web, stifle Silicon Valley startups, damage the United States' credibility on free speech and ultimately trigger the creation of an alternate-universe Internet. <br /><br /> The West Coast engineers say they were blindsided last Monday when the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act was introduced in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The bill has a bipartisan roster of co-sponsors who say it will be a tool for stopping the worst offenders in the world of online piracy. <br /><br /> The bill would give the attorney general new powers to shut down websites deemed dedicated to counterfeit material -- by going through the courts and by encouraging service providers to go after sites the Justice Department puts on a public blacklist. <br /><br /> According to the bill, a website would have to be "dedicated to infringing activities" to trigger the enforcement. <br /><br /> But Internet advocates warn the legislation would open a door for a handful of people in the federal government to wantonly power off entire websites that may be operating legally under current law. Though senators suggest the bill would save jobs by cracking down on piracy, critics say it will hurt the economy by threatening fledgling companies whenever copyrighted material shows up on their sites. <br /><br /> "If this bill had been law five or 10 years ago, there's a good chance that YouTube would no longer be around," Peter Eckersley, senior staff technologist at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told FoxNews.com. <br /><br /> Eckersley said the bill would mark a drastic departure from current law by allowing the government not just to strip copyrighted material off an offending website, but to order the shutdown of a domain name altogether. <br /><br /> Eighty-seven engineers who played a role in the creation of the Internet have sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee urging it to sideline the bill. <br /><br /> "If enacted, this legislation will risk fragmenting the Internet's global domain name system (DNS), create an environment of tremendous fear and uncertainty for technological innovation, and seriously harm the credibility of the United States in its role as a steward of key Internet infrastructure," they wrote. "All censorship schemes impact speech beyond the category they were intended to restrict, but this bill will be particularly egregious in that regard because it causes entire domains to vanish from the Web, not just infringing pages or files. Worse, an incredible range of useful, law-abiding sites can be blacklisted under this bill." <br /><br /> The bill's authors, co-sponsors and supporters disagree. They say it's dedicated to the worst-of-the-worst -- that the Justice Department could not shut down a site without first winning approval from a federal court and that the bill protects website operators by giving them the opportunity to remove pirating activity to get their site back online. <br /><br /> "No one would dispute that online infringement and counterfeiting of American intellectual property drains the American economy and costs American jobs," Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who introduced the bill, said in a written statement Wednesday. "No one would defend websites, primarily based overseas, that are dedicated to infringing activities. We continue (to) welcome input from everyone on the best way to attack the problem, but ignoring the problem, or saying it is too complicated, can no longer be an option." <br /><br /> The bill has broad bipartisan support on the committee, including that of Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch. Thirteen of the 16 committee members are co-sponsors, giving the bill a strong chance of passing if it comes up for a vote. It was scheduled to come up for consideration Thursday,. but the chairman postponed it as the Senate prepared to adjourn until after the elections. <br /><br /> Critics are crying foul, saying the panel has not scheduled a hearing for the bill, but committee spokeswoman Erica Chabot noted that the panel held an oversight hearing on intellectual property enforcement in June. <br /><br /> "You can have hearings before you introduce a bill," she said, stressing that Leahy and the co-sponsors are continuing to talk with "stakeholders on all sides." <br /><br /> The biggest supporters of, and contributors to, the proposal come from the business and entertainment communities. <br /><br /> The AFL-CIO, which supports the bill, claims movie and music pirating costs more than 200,000 jobs. A fact sheet put out by the Senate Judiciary Committee claimed intellectual property theft, some occurring on foreign websites, costs the U.S. economy more than $100 billion annually. <br /><br /> Steve Tepp, a piracy expert for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the censorship claims are off-base.<br /><br /> "This bill is a bipartisan effort that targets sites engaged in activities that all 153 countries in the WTO have agreed are illegal," he said. "These websites have no place in a legitimate online market. ... This legislation provides a critically needed tool to try to address what is globally acknowledged as criminal activity to protect America's economic interests."<br /><br /> The Screen Actors Guild and several other entertainment industry groups released a joint statement commending the co-sponsors and claiming the bill would be aimed at "rogue websites" dedicated to "stealing" movies and music. <br /><br /> Specifically, the bill would let the attorney general go through federal court to try to shut down an offending website. If the court approves, the service provider would be required to "suspend" and "lock" the domain name. Those sites would be listed on a public website. Separately, the attorney general would start another public list of offending websites that have not been ordered shut down; the Justice Department would provide immunity to any service provider that takes action against them. <br /><br /> Eckersley called this "outright censorship" and rattled off the names of several prominent file-sharing and file-storing sites -- RapidShare, Dropbox, MediaFire -- that could be affected. He said sites like YouTube would probably survive, but new companies similar to it could easily fall victim to the bill if it becomes law. Plus, he said, people who store files like pictures and music online could, in the stroke of a judge's pen, see those files disappear. <br /><br /> "It's one thing to take down an infringing file. It's another to bully an entire ecosystem of people who are trying to innovate, and that's what this bill is trying to do," he said. "The senators who are well-intentioned haven't realized how much of the astonishing economic value of the Internet they're putting at risk here." <br /><br /> An advocacy group that opposes the bill, Demand Progress, claims 50,000 people have signed its online petition against the bill. <br /><br /> "Censoring the Internet is something we'd expect from China or Iran, not the U.S. Senate," the protest petition says. <br /><br /> Engineers and free-speech advocates have suggested the bill would undermine efforts to press China to unlock the Internet. Plus they warn of a scenario in which engineers will circumvent the law by creating a black-market Internet where outlawed sites could be accessed. <br /><br /> This could create two conflicting Internet worlds, where some sites are accessible to some users and others are not; where commerce, some legitimate, happens in one world and not in the other. <br /><br /> "Errors and divergences will appear," the 87 engineers warned in their letter. "Contradictory addresses will confuse browsers and frustrate the people using them." <br /><br /> Eckersley had a simpler way to describe it: "Chaos."<br /><br /></p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[By FRAZIER MOORE  AP Television Writer NEW YORK (AP) - The number of gay and bisexual characters on scripted broadcast network TV has risen slightly this season to 23 out of a total of nearly 600 roles, according to the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. The 15th annual "Where We Are on TV" report released Wednesday found that 3.9 percent of actors appearing regularly on prime-time network drama and comedy series in the 2010-11 season will portray gay, lesbian or bisexual characters. That's up from 3 percent in the 2009-10 season. The increase in 2008-09 was 2.6 percent. Only six of the 23 gay and lesbian characters this season are nonwhite, GLAAD found. Using information provided by ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and CW, the group reviewed 84 scripted series announced to air this season. The only original programming announced by the gay-focused cable networks here! and Logo is unscripted, alternative programming, so they were not part of this year's character count, GLAAD said. While the number of broadcast drama series featuring regular or recurring gay characters is unchanged from last year, the number of comedy series has increased from 8 to 11, including new comedies "Running Wilde" (Fox), "Hellcats" (CW), "(Bleep) My Dad Says" (CBS), and midseason show "Happy Endings" (ABC).

On mainstream cable channels, the number of regular characters rebounded to 35 after a two-year decline. HBO features the greatest number of gay and bisexual characters, with 10 regular and recurring characters. The HBO drama "True Blood" is the most inclusive series on television, featuring six characters, the group found. The overall increase in gay characters "not only reflects the shift in American culture towards greater awareness and understanding of our community, but also a new industry standard that a growing number of creators and networks are adopting," GLAAD President Jarrett Barrios said in a statement. He pointed to such programs as ABC's "Modern Family" and Fox's "Glee" as indicators that "mainstream audiences embrace gay characters and want to see well-crafted stories about our lives."  ___  Online: http://www.glaad.org/tvreport10]]></itunes:subtitle>

Katherine has asked Alejandra to move her family into a nearly Jackson condo but Alejandra has refused and Katherine won't put her foot down.<br /><br /></p>

County Superior Court -- obtained by TMZ -- grousing that he's expected to pay $3,000 a month in child support for sons Jaafar and Jermajesty ... even though his average monthly income for the last year has been under $1,100. Jermaine is asking the judge to slash support payment to $215 a month. According to the docs, Jermaine made a onetime appearance on "Big Brother" back in 2007, raking in a handsome $450,000 for his troubles -- but since then, Jermaine claims his business has floundered.  Jermaine claims his baby mama Alejandra not only earns more than him ... but she gets a free ride along with his kids at the Jackson compound, thanks to Katherine's generosity. Katherine has asked Alejandra to move her family into a nearly Jackson condo but Alejandra has refused and Katherine won't put her foot down.

			<title>Lindsay Lohan Could Get Court Appointed Conservatorship, Experts Say</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/lindsay-lohan-could-get-court-appointed-conservatorship-experts-say]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>A Los Angeles Superior Court Judge reversed Judge Elden Fox&rsquo;s decision to keep Lindsay Lohan behind bars for a minimum of 30 days after failing two court-ordered drug tests.<br /><br /> But according to Santa Monica criminal defense attorney Steve Cron, being freed on $300,000 bail is simply just delaying the inevitable.<br /><br /> &ldquo;I am, quite frankly, surprised by the reversed decision, but she will return to court on October 22 and Judge Fox will sentence her right back to jail again,&rdquo; he told Pop Tarts. &ldquo;But of course, due to prison overcrowding, she will only have to serve a portion of that sentence.&rdquo;<br /><br /> In the meantime, the terms of Lohan&rsquo;s probation remain in place and she will have to continue reporting to her probation officer and undergoing mandatory drug testing. And although the troubled starlet is 24 years old, there is a chance the courts could appoint a third party to act as a legal guardian over her affairs, given her behavior and parenting situation.<br /><br /> According to multiple reports and experts, Lohan&rsquo;s divorced parents, Dina and Michael, may be part of her continual drug and alcohol-related problems. Lohan has on numerous occasions spoken out about her father&rsquo;s alleged abuse and the &ldquo;hurt&rdquo; he had caused over the years. And although she and her mom appear to have a close bond, Dina has been heavily criticized for denying that her daughter even has substance-abuse issues.<br /><br /> &ldquo;Under the California Welfare and Institute Code for Mental Disorders and Chronic Alcoholism, the courts may determine Lindsay unfit to care for herself even though she is an adult,&rdquo; former California prosecutor, Robin Sax, told Pop Tarts. &ldquo;This would be subject to another court hearing separate to the criminal case, and could be determined from a mental health evaluation made when and if she returns to rehab.&rdquo;<br /><br /> In 2007, Britney Spears was placed under the conservatorship of her father Jamie Spears to manage both her personal and business affairs following a long period of incredibly unruly behavior.<br /><br /> "Like Britney, Lindsay would have to exhibit signs that she is incapable of caring for herself, and I&rsquo;m not sure if she has reached that point yet," Sax said. &ldquo;With Britney, she really reached rock bottom &ndash; shaved her head, locked herself in a bathroom, and she was doing these types of things not under the influence of drugs and alcohol."<br /><br /> Los Angeles-based criminal defense lawyer and law professor, Jeffrey W. Steinberger, believes Lohan needs someone responsible to legally manage her personal affairs, although the process may take some time.<br /><br /> "What she needs is an emotional conservator, she needs somebody to run the balance in her life and they (the courts) can appoint people to supervise where she is going,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They can probably do that after she does this one more stint in jail."<br /><br /> Steinberger said that Judge Fox, who is currently residing over Lohan&rsquo;s DUI case, is known to be "compassionate," and may begin to look for an appropriate conservator between now and Lohan&rsquo;s Oct. 22 hearing.<br /><br /> &ldquo;Judge Fox might get all the paperwork together and have motions taken and have the hearings as to whether or not she has the capacity to run her own life. It is really a significant move by courts to take away a person's decision-making abilities, so they have to take this all very seriously. They have to get in psychiatric reports, they have to get probation reports, and they have to do a lot of work on it,&rdquo; he continued.<br /><br /> If Lohan is appointed a conservator, she would be required to report to that particular person instead of a probation officer. The conservator would also handle all her finances, issues regarding court supervision and employment opportunities.<br /><br /> "Lindsay just keeps going into contempt of court, which is a legal issue, and the judge can get irritated at that because she is violating his orders. The other issue is that she cannot control her own life. The first time we heard of this was three years ago with the Santa Monica arrest, and then it went to the Beverly Hills arrest, and she's been in six rehabs and she can't make it happen,&rdquo; Steinberger added. &ldquo;So the courts may just do this as a matter of fact because they don't want to waste the prison space, this girl doesn't need the prison space, she needs somebody to watch over her to keep her out of rehab and keep her on a straight line."<br /><br /><br /><br /> Deidre Behar contributed to this report.</p>]]></description>

			<title>Lindsay Lohan - Judge denied actress bail before she was handcuffed in court and taken into custody</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Troubled actress Lindsay Lohan was back in court in Los Angeles on Friday (September 24) to face the music after admitting last week to failing a recent drug test. The judge in the case was clearly not happy about this latest setback.<br /><br /> According to TMZ, Judge Elden Fox did not hear any testimony from Lohan's lawyers before denying the 24-year-old "Mean Girls" star bail and ordering her to immediately report to jail. Lohan was reportedly handcuffed in court before being taken into custody, meaning she could be behind bars until the next hearing in the case, scheduled for October 22.<br /><br /> Wearing black sunglasses, a long black blazer over a high-waisted white skirt and black top and shiny stacked heels, Lohan breezed past the assembled paparazzi around 8 a.m. on Friday on her way into court, five days after Judge Fox revoked her probation and issued a bench warrant that would have been executed had Lohan failed to show up for the hearing.<br /><br /> Last weekend, Lohan admitted to failing her recent drug test, conceding that she was still struggling with addiction.<br /><br /> "Regrettably, I did in fact fail my most recent drug test and if I am asked, I am prepared to appear before judge Fox next week as a result," Lohan tweeted late Friday night. "Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away over night. I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps forward every day. I am testing every single day and doing what I must do to prevent any mishaps in the future. ... This was certainly a setback for me but I am taking responsibility for my actions and I'm prepared to face the consequences."<br /><br /> TMZ ran earlier unconfirmed reports that Lohan actually failed two drug tests. One was for cocaine, which appears to be the incident Lohan was referring to in her tweet, while another was for amphetamines that could be related to the prescription ADHD drug she takes, Adderall, which is a stimulant. The site reported that the Probation Department was not expected to recommend jail time for the second offense because of some questions over the paperwork in that incident.<br /><br /> According to the conditions of her post-rehab release, Judge Fox could send Lohan back to jail for 30 days. Lohan served 13 days of a 90-day jail sentence in July over a probation violation from a pair of 2007 DUI cases; she subsequently spent 23 days in a rehab facility, serving less than one third of her 90-day court-ordered sentence.<br /><br /> Lohan's lawyer has not returned requests for comment on the case.<br /><br /></p>]]></description>

The music icons will sit beside Randy Jackson on the upcoming season of the hit talent search show set to air early next year.<br /><br /> The big reveal came Wednesday afternoon in a live webcast on the show's official website. <br /><br /> Jennifer and Steven join the panel following the departures of Simon Cowell, Ellen DeGeneres and Kara DioGuardi. <br /><br /> Tyler says he is excited to help find new talent. <br /><br /> "I plan on being honest and killing them with love," he said.

I am so excited to work with all of you and watch the journey we are going to take together." <br /><br /> "I'm looking for the next Michael Jackson.

			<title>LESBIAN FAMILIES</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/lesbian-families]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>I know for a fact that I want a family with my fiance Amanda.  I&rsquo;m sure a lot of Lesbian and Gay couples feel the same way.  But lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it more and more because 3 of my closest friends are pregnant &ndash; all of which are Heterosexual, and have the luxury of being able to create something beautiful that is a union of their own genes &ndash; asbolutely free.  (Well the creation is)..  Unfortunately that isn&rsquo;t the case for the couples in the LGBTQ community.  Unfortunately, we weren&rsquo;t made to procreate between eachother.  This is one of the main reasons why religions are against us.  As they believe that the purpose of our sex organs is to solely be used to bring life.  So for a union of the same sex is un-exceptional because its just not normal.  A friend of mine, who is also in a Lesbian relationship said to me &ldquo;We are basically fucked&rdquo; and she couldn&rsquo;t be more right.  Being that we have the need to be parents and create a LOVING family, because after-all we are human beings.  We can&rsquo;t just do that &ndash; with out stating the obvious.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> So now we are stuck with several choices.  <strong>A: Adopt.</strong><br /><br /> <br /><br /> Honestly, the whole adoption process is a big hassel, especially when you are a Lesbian couple.  Although NYS allows LGBT couples to adopt children.  The bright side is you are taking a child out of the states grasps, and providing them a nourishing enviornment of love that they wouldn&rsquo;t have otherwise if they remained in the state.<br /><br /> <strong>B: Sperm Donor, One of us carries.</strong><br /><br /> Awesome concept.  We are able to have the baby grow inside one of us. We are able to have all rights connected to us with no connection to the &ldquo;Sperm Donor&rdquo; at all.  We are able to choose the babies ethincity, physical attributes, genetics etc.  The downside is that the baby will not have one partners genes.<br /><br /> <strong>C: Partner Assisted Reproduction</strong><br /><br /> This is hands down the best option out there.. Basically what happens is that one partner provides the egg, which is fertilized outside the body and then implanted into the other partner&rsquo;s body. She carries the baby to term and gives birth. An egg is extracted from the egg donor mom and fertilized with sperm from a sperm donor in vitro (outside the body) and then implanted into the woman carrying the child. Usually more than one egg is implanted so the likelihood of multiple births is much greater.This procedure is much more expensive than simple donor insemination, but some women may opt for this because both women will have a biological tie to the child.<br /><br /> I am pretty sure option C would be picked by most of my friends, and I&rsquo;m sure you guys would agree to this procedure.  How ever the overall cost is astronomical.  I feel that this shouldn&rsquo;t be as expensive as it is.  From what I&rsquo;ve seen its close to 15,000.  Which is crazy to me.  Its kind of like a slap in the face.  Because theres all these free clinics paid by the government to assist those who are uninsured and pregnant.  Some of these women have 4 kids and pregnant again.  But they get all these things free from the government.  Which is fine, their taxes pay for it if they are working class citzens but just can&rsquo;t afford the insurance that their job may provide therefore their taxes and our taxes is going for a good cause. Then you have the community who chooses not to work, but keeps procreating children with out a father or stable income.  They keep receiving free food stamps, wic and assistance. Then you have the LGBTQ community, which I&rsquo;m sure there are many classes within that are not working.  But those who do work, where is our taxes going for our needs as a Americans living as we wish?  What taxes help the forgotten ones?  I&rsquo;m not asking for a free ride, I&rsquo;m just asking for something within&rsquo; means to get. So that I may create a family with my fiance.  Where we can raise kids that are statiscally better behaved then those who have heterosexual parents.  <br /><br /> <br /><br /> v.i.i.t.a.l Free your mind from societies restraints &ndash; and live&hellip;  http://viital.net</p>]]></description>

			<title>Lindsay Lohan says she's ready to face judge for failed drug test</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/lindsay-lohan-says-she-s-ready-to-face-judge-for-failed-drug-test]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Lindsay Lohan acknowledged through Twitter postings Friday night that she failed a recent drug test, but the actress said she's "working hard to overcome" her drug addiction.<br /><br /> Lohan's supervised probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction requires frequent drug tests. The judge warned her last month any failure could send her back to jail.<br /><br /> "Regrettably, I did in fact fail my most recent drug test and if I am asked, I am prepared to appear before judge Fox next week as a result," Lohan tweeted Friday evening.<br /><br /> She spent 23 days in a court-ordered drug rehab program last month, which followed a 13-day jail stint imposed when a Los Angeles judge ruled that Lohan violated her probation.<br /><br /> Judge Elden Fox, who took over Lohan's case when she was released, imposed a new set of rules for her to follow until November. It included weekly counseling sessions for alcohol and drug rehab, random drug tests and behavioral therapy.<br /><br /> Lohan's lawyer did not respond to CNN requests for comment Friday. A spokesman for the Los Angeles County district attorney also declined to comment.<br /><br /> No new court date has been announced for Lohan to face Judge Fox concerning the failed drug test. <br /><br /> "Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away overnight," Lohan tweeted. "I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps."<br /><br /> Lohan tweeted that she was "doing what I must do to prevent any mishaps in the future." <br /><br /> "This was certainly a setback for me, but I am taking responsibility for my actions and I'm prepared to face the consequences," she tweeted. <br /><br /> Lohan made fun of her substance abuse troubles in a backstage skit broadcast during last Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards. <br /><br /> She appeared with show host Chelsea Handler, who was wearing an alcohol-detection bracelet like the one Lohan recently wore. <br /><br /> "Wake up, Handler, pull it together," Lohan said as she slammed Handler against a wall. "You're a menace. Do you think anyone will work with a drunk? Take it from me, they don't."</p>]]></description>

                <p><br /><br />Rumors, gossip, exclusion. Mean girls have a lot of weapons in their repertoire &ndash; here&rsquo;s how to combat all that nastiness.<br /><br /><strong>Step 1</strong> No matter how intimidated you may feel on the inside, do your best to exude confidence on the outside. Standing up straight and maintaining eye contact will send the signal that you&rsquo;re not a doormat. Mean girls single out targets they deem weak, but often stay away from confident girls.<br /><br /><strong>Step 2</strong> When possible, travel in a group of friends. Mean girls tend to shy away from packs, instead focusing their attention on solo prey.<br /><br /><strong>In need of friends? Sign up for extracurricular activities, or get a job after school where you can meet teens your age outside of school.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Step 3</strong> Be nice and stay nice. If you&rsquo;re in a class or after-school activity with a mean girl, compliment what she&rsquo;s wearing or nonchalantly offer help with a math problem. If you can get one mean girl on your good side, the rest may fall in line.<br /><br /><strong>Ask a parent or older sibling for advice. Almost everyone has had at least one experience with bullies.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Step 4</strong> Mean girls thrive on reactions, so if you&rsquo;re not making any headway, go into &ldquo;ignore mode&rdquo; and pretend you&rsquo;re immune to everything they say or do. This will probably only work a few times, though. If the mean girls are really determined, ignoring them is not a long-term solution.<br /><br /><strong>Step 5</strong> Confront mean girls using the divide-and-conquer approach. Calmly talk to an influential girl one-on-one, and ask her an up-front question like, &ldquo;Did I do something that made you mad?&rdquo; Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements rather than &ldquo;you&rdquo; ones. A mean girl can easily deny anything you say about her, but she&rsquo;ll have a harder time arguing against your personal feelings.<br /><br /><strong>Before your conversation, rehearse your replies, imagining how you&rsquo;ll firmly, but politely, stand your ground and stay confident no matter what.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Step 6</strong> If the mean girls are relentless, causing you to become depressed or anxious, or threatening to get physical, involve your parents and the school faculty. Though it may not seem like it, popular kids don&rsquo;t actually run the school. Those who do run it can help put any mean girls in their place.<br /><br /><strong>Tyra Banks, Victoria Beckham, and Rosario Dawson all say they were once the constant targets of mean girls.</strong><br /><br /></p>

			<title>How to Know if You’re Boring</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://aliyaleighlive.libsyn.com/how-to-know-if-you-re-boring-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>We&rsquo;d all like to think we&rsquo;re fabulously fascinating at all times. But it&rsquo;s good to know the signs that you&rsquo;re boring someone, just in case.</strong> <br /><br /><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check out their eyes Check out the other person&rsquo;s eyes. Are they darting around the room, as if looking for an escape? Or, worse, are they completely unfocused, as if they&rsquo;ve lapsed into a coma?<br /><br /><strong>Check out their feet, too; if they&rsquo;re pointed away from you, they&rsquo;re poised to run.</strong><br /><br /><strong>Step 2:</strong> Be aware of their responses Be aware of their responses.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[We&rsquo;d all like to think we&rsquo;re fabulously fascinating at all times. But it&rsquo;s good to know the signs that you&rsquo;re boring someone, just in case. Step 1: Check out their eyes Check out the other person&rsquo;s eyes. Are they darting around the room, as if looking for an escape? Or, worse, are they completely unfocused, as if they&rsquo;ve lapsed into a coma?Check out their feet, too; if they&rsquo;re pointed away from you, they&rsquo;re poised to run.Step 2: Be aware of their responses Be aware of their responses. If your discourse isn&rsquo;t eliciting anything more than polite nods, the occasional &ldquo;really?&rdquo; or a monotone &ldquo;wow,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s time to change the topic &mdash; or let the other person speak.Step 3: Watch for topic switches Watch out for sudden topic switches.

            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>Wondering how the Affordable Care Act affects you? The health care reform bill, passed in March 2010, included 46 key provisions. Here are some highlights.</p>
                <h4>Step 1: <a name="realize-the-timeline">Realize the timeline</a></h4>
                <div class="textile">
                <p>Realize that not all of the provisions of the law went into effect immediately. The changes are being implemented gradually, with some of them not starting until 2014.</p>
                <h4>Step 2: <a name="understand-the-immediate-changes">Understand the immediate changes</a></h4>
                <div class="textile">
                <p>Understand some of the immediate changes: patients under 19 can&rsquo;t be denied coverage based on a pre-existing condition, insurance companies can no longer rescind coverage, preventive services like mammograms are fully covered, children may remain on a parent&rsquo;s health insurance plan until age 26, and lifetime coverage limits have been prohibited.</p>
                <p>Tip: The provision concerning young adult coverage takes effect whenever health plans renew coverage on or after September 23, 2010, so some adult children may have a gap in coverage.</p>

Aliya I ask because I see so many females post that their Christian but once I've spoken to them I see no reflection of God, coming out of a life style picking up the cross and denying yourself is what Christ says one must do right. So if one were to follow Christ then the reflection of the Lord must and will shine through and we would let go of those worldy habits and excuses.</div>

                <p>So you'd like a response well my sister first I'd like to say you can't F*** a girl you might indulge in sexual activity but you weren't born to F*** a girl. 2nd a fathers responsability is to raise his family on the foundation of Christ not on the foundation and DOCTRINE of man, when doing so then you may guide your children and teach them that we are in the spirit and everytime we have sex outside of marriage we divide ourselfs. As it is written in Ephisians 5 that when a Man marrys a Woman they become 1 in Christ. These are the ways it should be but of course the flesh is weak and many kow this, but the same will study for a test or job or exam but they won't study to save their lifes! I don't want you to take this a judging you but sharing with you, you see there's Niggas out there that would&nbsp; hit o you for their EGO.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>State Department Calls Plan to Burn Korans 'Un-American'</strong> <br /><br />From Fox News<br /><br />The State Department described as "un-American" plans by a controversial church to burn Korans in memory of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks -- though the head of that church says he is not deterred.<br /><br />State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley called the plan "inflammatory" at a briefing Tuesday and said it would put U.S. troops and interest around the world at risk, echoing a concern expressed by the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. <br /><br />"It doesn't represent the vast majority of American views," Crowley said. <br /><br />Secretary of State Clinton also condemned the church's plans during her remarks at a State Department dinner she hosted in observance of Iftar, the breaking of the daily fast during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.<br /><br />"I am heartened by the clear, unequivocal condemnation of this disrespectful, disgraceful act that has come from American religious leaders of all faiths," Clinton said.<br /><br />Gen. David Petraeus, head of Multinational Forces in Afghanistan, repeated his warning Tuesday that any plans to burn the Muslim holy book -- considered a major offense in the Islamic community -- would jeopardize U.S. military efforts. <br /><br />But Terry Jones, pastor of the 50-member Dove World Outreach Center in Gainesville, Fla., says not even protests and death threats will deter him. He told MyFoxOrlando.com that he and the church's members feel strongly about their decision to hold the book burning despite being denied a permit from the fire department. <br /><br />"We understand the general's concerns, we are taking those into consideration," Jones was quoted saying. "We feel it's maybe the right time for America to stand up. How long are we going to bow down? How long are we going to be controlled by the terrorists, by radical Islam?" <br /><br />On Tuesday, Petraeus said that even rumors of the possibility the church would hold a Koran-burning touched off protests in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Indonesia. <br /><br />"Images of the burning of a Koran would undoubtedly be used by extremists in Afghanistan -- and around the world -- to inflame public opinion and incite violence," Petraeus said. "Were the actual burning to take place, the safety of our soldiers and civilians would be put in jeopardy and accomplishment of the mission would be made more difficult." <br /><br />Though the National Association of Evangelicals and the National Council of Churches have denounced the plan to burn the Koran, Jones indicated he had support from other churches around the country. He did not name any, however. <br /><br />Jones said he and members of his church are taking seriously several death threats directed at them, but if something happened, it would not be their fault. <br /><br />"We will not be responsible," Jones said. "We are only reacting to the violence that is already there in that religion."<br /><br />Click here to read more from MyFoxOrlando.com. <br /><br /></p>]]></description>

Add your favorite veggies for a great dinner served over rice, couscous or with pasta on the side.<br />1 tbsp olive oil<br />2 tbsp minced garlic<br />1 large yellow onion, diced<br />1/2 tbsp tomato paste<br />1/3 cup veggie broth<br />1 eggplant, diced<br />1 medium zucchini, diced<br />1 green pepper, diced<br />1/2 cup quartered mushrooms<br />1 can chopped tomatoes (or 1 cup diced tomatoes, peeled and seeded)<br />2 tbs chopped parsley<br />2 tbs chopped basil<br />salt and pepper to taste<br />Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and saut&eacute; about 1 minute. Add the onions and saut&eacute; until translucent, 4-5 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook over medium heat until it darkens and give off a sweet aroma, about 1 minute. Add broth and stir, deglazing the pan (scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan). Add the eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms and green pepper and simmer until the veggies are tender but not falling apart, 10-12 mins. Stir in the tomatoes and continue to simmer until the tomatoes are heated through, about 2-3 mins. Add the parsley and basil; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve.<br /><br />Notes:<br />You can try using cooking wine or dry sherry to deglaze the pan.<br />Dried herbs can be substituted (~1 tsp each), but add them with the veggies instead of at the end of the recipe to allow the flavors to develop.<br /><br /></p>
