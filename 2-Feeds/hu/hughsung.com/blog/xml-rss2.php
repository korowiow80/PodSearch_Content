 <title>Our Debt-Free Anniversary</title>
 <link>http://hughsung.com/blog/index.php?itemid=1116?a=b</link>
<description><![CDATA[On December 18, 2007, we sent off the last check to pay off our Chase home equity loan.  That marked the end of a 9 month journey and the last of our outstanding consumer/credit debt in the form of multiple credit cards, car loans, and the equity loan (which was supposed to "consolidate" a bunch of other loans like a flippin' shell game - HAH, NOT!), all of which totaled almost $55,000.  To celebrate, we created a home video to pay tribute to <a href="http://daveramsey.com">Dave Ramsey</a>, a popular radio and (now) TV talk show host whose financial "baby steps" were the main road map and inspiration to knock off these debts:<br />
<br />
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/erCsS9HdMwM&hl=en_US&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/erCsS9HdMwM&hl=en_US&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object><br />
<br />
Fine and well, but we still had our mortgage hanging over our heads.  Even with the freed up cash flow, I was initially expecting that it would still take another 7 or 8 years (or longer) to pay off our house.  Well, thanks to some amazing promotions for Kyungmi (she became a full partner at her practice) and by sticking to our "rice and beans" barebones lifestyle, we actually accelerated our payoff schedule considerably.  As of Oct. 7, 2009, the Sung family is officially, completely, absolutely, 100%, <h2>Debt-Free - HOUSE AND EVERYTHING, BABY!!</h2><br />
<br />
Being "Dave" fans, our favorite radio/podcast episodes are the Debt-Free Fridays, when callers get an opportunity to celebrate by screaming on the air, "WEEEE'RE DEEEEEBT FREEEEEEE!!"  Dave usually interviews the callers to learn how they paid off their debts, and frequently he likes to ask what the hardest part of getting started was.  Kyungmi and I were reflecting on that question as we mulled over the reality of finally being on the "other side" of the debt mountain - if Dave asked me that, I'd have to say that the hardest part of getting started for me was actually believing that this was possible, and having the imagination to find creative answers to get out of our sea of red ink.  I remember the very first time I tried making a written budget (on a Google spreadsheet), and how depressed I felt after seeing how badly our monthly expenses exceeded our income.  It simply looked impossible at the time, which was even more frustrating seeing how our supposedly "great" income at the time was being completely nullified by our debts.  We must've worked through that initial budget over a dozen times, looking for every scrap and thread to shave off of the expense column.  Learning how to cut hair myself and cutting off cable tv completely were probably the more radical steps we took, as well as cutting off my gym membership and daily Starbucks runs.  The first few months of "the plan" crawled by at a snail's pace financially-speaking, with barely a dent being made against our debt skyscraper, but once the "little debts" were knocked off, the increased cash flow started to make noticeable headway against the larger ones.   <br />
<br />
I'm still stunned and pinching myself to see if this is really happening to us - no debts?  no mortgage?  at ALL?  and all this in just under 3 years??<br />
<br />
Faith and Imagination: more powerful than talent or income to get you out of debt and on your way to becoming wealthy.  So what are YOU waiting for?  If we can do it, SO CAN YOU!!<br />

 <title>41 is the new 21...i think...</title>
 <link>http://hughsung.com/blog/index.php?itemid=1109?a=b</link>
<description><![CDATA[As the calendar turns my biological clock past my 41st birthday, I'm not sure how many more of these "Benjamin Button" tales I'll be able to regale, but as long as I still have a few hairs on my balding head, I might as well enjoy them while they last:<br />
<br />
<li>About 2 months ago, Kyungmi and I took the boys in to the county office to have all of our passports renewed.  The clerk looked at my wife and asked, "So these are your four boys?"  We have three sons...Kyungmi was really, really peeved...</li><br />
<li>About a month ago, we had some visitors at Church.  Following the worship service, Paul and I went to greet them and invite them to our fellowship meal downstairs.  One of the ladies looked at us and asked if we were brothers.  Paul (my oldest 15 year old son) and I shared a hearty laugh.  To make matters worse, she said, "I thought the pastor was your father!"  Um...the pastor is about the same age as I am...</li><br />
<li>A few days ago, a gentleman was going around the neighborhood asking for support for his upcoming marathon for Multiple Sclerosis.  When I opened the door, he looked at me and asked if my mother or father was home.  Next time, I promised Paul that I would call him over and call him, "Dad".  </li><br />
<br />
Sigh...i might just start dying my hair grey, this is getting ridiculous ;)]]>

 <title>Webinar Beta #1 for &quot;Clair de lune from Scratch&quot;</title>
 <link>http://hughsung.com/blog/index.php?itemid=1107?a=b</link>
<description><![CDATA[<embed flashvars="autoplay=false" width="425" height="344" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" src="http://www.ustream.tv/flash/video/2217363" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" /><br />
<br />
What is a "webinar"?  It's a semantic and functional mashup of the words "web" and "seminar" - simply put, a seminar on the web! The "Clair de lune from Scratch" YouTube video series has been garnering a LOT of attention and wonderful comments from folks all over the world.  As terrific as the YouTube medium is, I'm limited to posting clips under 10 minutes at a time, forcing me to keep the lesson points short and right to the point (wait a minute...maybe that's a <i>good </i>thing...) The next step will be a series of "live" webinars to go more in depth into the piece and interact with students in realtime.  With the webinar format, I'll be able to spend pretty much as much time as I want to help answer questions via email, posted video responses, realtime chat, and even passing the virtual camera to any participant with a webcam!  How cool is that?<br />
<br />
I recorded the above webinar test last night.  Keep in mind, I'm still working out the bugs, and learning how to manipulate 3 different cameras on the fly.  I'm going to try to replace the front camera, for example, and definitely increase the volume of the lapel voice microphone to better match the piano mic.  Feel free to post any other suggestions you may have in the comments below.<br />

 <title>Clair de lune from Scratch: YouTube Piano Lessons for Beginners</title>
 <link>http://hughsung.com/blog/index.php?itemid=1103?a=b</link>
<description><![CDATA[Piano pedagogy has taken a fascinating life online, most notably within the video juggernaut YouTube.  While the vast majority of video lessons appear to range from homemade "how to's" for a few phrases from popular songs to samples for subscription lesson sites or DVD packages, one thing is clear:  there is a huge demand for video instructions on how to play the piano.<br />
<br />
Can an absolute beginner use videos to learn to play a classical masterpiece with real music notation?  That's the question we'd like to explore in this experimental new video lesson series, "Clair de lune from Scratch", where pianist Hugh Sung teaches Claude Debussy's masterpiece a measure at a time, combining cutting edge technologies with traditional piano pedagogy:<br />
<br />
<object data="http://www.youtube.com/p/23BA4D8592904FB0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" height="355" width="425"><br />
<param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /><br />
<param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><br />
<param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/p/23BA4D8592904FB0&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><br />
</object><br />
<br />
Participants can submit questions or comments via YouTube's comment feature, or by joining the <a href="http://www.pianoworld.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/forums/30/1/Adult%20Beginners%20Forum.html">PianoWorld.com Adult Beginners Forum</a>. A public domain version of the "Clair de lune" score is also available as a PDF or MusicReader file from the <a href="http://airturn.com/musicreader-library/piano-solo">AirTurn Piano Solos Library</a>.  MusicReader makes it easy to draw digital ink markings on the music for effective study of the score - free demo versions of MusicReader for Mac and PC can be downloaded from <a href="http://airturn.com/musicreader/musicreader">http://airturn.com/musicreader/musicreader</a>.]]>

 <title>&quot;Nach Bach&quot;</title>
 <link>http://hughsung.com/blog/index.php?itemid=1102?a=b</link>
<description><![CDATA[Here's the second of 2 videos, featuring a new piece by Gary Schocker called "Nach Bach", based loosely on the J.S. Bach Sonata in A minor performed in the previous video.  Sorry for the plain jane single angle shot, i accidentally forgot to turn on the 2nd camera before playing!  Thank goodness this camera at least had the XLR microphone input...<br />

 <title>Multiplicity: Making One Cello Sound like 16</title>
 <link>http://hughsung.com/blog/index.php?itemid=1098?a=b</link>
<description><![CDATA[Found this on Wired yesterday, and I'm completely fascinated with how cellist <a href="http://www.zoekeating.com/">Zoe Keating</a> uses looping software and MIDI foot pedals to assemble these quasi-minimalistic compositions in realtime:<br />

<br />
Just twittered a "Bravo" to Ms. Keating - i guess I'm really late to the game, as her first of 2 self-produced albums came out back in 2004, but this is still inspiring stuff!  Wonder if i can rig up my piano since i already have a house full of <a href="http://airturn.com">programmable pedals</a>... ;)]]>

 <title>Unpacking the MTNA 2009 Exhibitors&apos; Convention</title>
 <link>http://hughsung.com/blog/index.php?itemid=1090?a=b</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>While i didn't get a chance to participate in any of the main MTNA conference or panel discussion events, i still found the Exhibitors' Hall at the 2009 MTNA convention in Atlanta, GA to be a fascinating microcosm of the classical music industry.&#160; My partners Lester and SoYoung were on hand from the first day, and i arrived a day later to help man the AirTurn booth.&#160; This being my very first convention ever, i had absolutely no idea what to expect.&#160; Lester reported that the initial day saw a good bit of foot traffic and some particularly encouraging signs, namely that a good number of folks already recognized who we were and what we were selling.&#160; Of all the companies and products that he's worked on, the AirTurn seems to be achieving the fastest brand recognition so far among our target musician demographics.&#160; </p>  <p>Frazzled from only 2 hours of sleep the night before (had to be picked up at 3 am by the airport shuttle for a 5:30 departure) and a flight buffeted by nasty turbulence, it's a wonder i was able to speak in cohesive sentences, much less make a meaningful sales pitch!&#160; I started out by handing out brochures and business cards, but then received a great tip from the jewelry vendors in the booth next to ours to ask for names and email addresses from booth visitors.&#160; Lester calls this &quot;pull marketing&quot;, enabling us to send info and promotions to our clients, as opposed to simply &quot;pushing&quot; our own brochures and hoping for a response that might never come.&#160; Another great bit of advice from my jewelry friends was to try to write little notes about each client as reminders to make future communications more personal.</p>  <p>Boy, some of those first clients were tough cookies!&#160; One lady came over to see my demonstration of ink annotations in MusicReader.&#160; I was showing her how easy it was to add digital ink stamps of music notation symbols with a mouse, and started by adding a flat next to a note.</p>  <p>&quot;No!&quot; she practically screamed.&#160; &quot;Wrong!!&quot;</p>  <p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;</p>  <p>&quot;Wrong!! You put the flat in the wrong place!!&quot;    <br />I had no idea what she was talking about and took a closer look at the stamp i had just made:</p>  <p><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/flat1.png"><img title="flat1" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="146" alt="flat1" src="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/flat1_thumb.png" width="204" border="0" /></a>&#160;</p>  <p>I tried to explain that it was easy to erase digital notations and redraw them, and did so like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/flat2.png"><img title="flat2" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="146" alt="flat2" src="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/flat2_thumb.png" width="204" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p></p>  <p>&quot;No! No! No! That's completely wrong!&quot; she wailed.&#160; Business lesson #1 insists that the customer is always right, so i erased the offending accidental and gave it another go:</p>  <p><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/flat3.png"><img title="flat3" style="border-top-width: 0px; display: inline; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" height="146" alt="flat3" src="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/flat3_thumb.png" width="204" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Finally, she exclaimed, &quot;Yes!&#160; <em>Now</em> that's correct!&quot;&#160; My goodness, i thought she was going to have an aneurism and pop a vessel from her forehead!&#160; &quot;You must understand&quot;, she insisted, &quot;I have photographic memory!&#160; PHOTOGRAPHIC MEMORY! I see everything and remember every detail!&#160; If you write it wrong, I can't get it out of my head!!&quot; She brought her hands to her eyes as if to shield them from some visual monstrosity invading her periphery.&#160; </p>  <p>Ooookaaaayy.....moving right along...</p>  <p>Another woman came along and gave a critical squint as i tried to explain the various viewing options with MusicReader - double page views, intelligent half-page views that zoomed the music without cutting staves off, etc.&#160; She looked dourly at my 15 inch HP laptop screen and asked, &quot;Is that the only color for reading the music?&quot;</p>  <p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot;&#160; </p>  <p>&quot;You know - does the music only come in that shade of white?&quot;</p>  <p>Now she had me completely lost.&#160; Assuming i've been reading music for about 37 years or so, I'm pretty sure that most music is supposed to be printed as black ink on white paper, unless i've been horribly color blind all these years...</p>  <p>&quot;Well, it's just that I prefer reading music printed on ivory paper.&#160; That shade of white is just too bright.&#160; And what about an option to have the paper black and the notes white?&quot;</p>  <p>We certainly want to listen to our customers and take their suggestions into account.&#160; I suppose adding a feature to change the background color of music scores shouldn't be too difficult to implement - it's just pretty remarkable to come across such creative suggestions!</p>  <p>Here are some pictures from our booth setup.&#160; I'm really pleased with how our banners came out, if i may say so myself!</p>  <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:8747F07C-CDE8-481f-B0DF-C6CFD074BF67:86534d24-b55a-4198-8af9-c3a4f1bef275" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/IMG_14498x6.JPG" title="Lester, SoYoung and me at the AirTurn MTNA Exhibition booth" rel="thumbnail"><img border="0" src="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/IMG_1449.png" width="410" height="369" /></a></div>  <p></p>  <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:8747F07C-CDE8-481f-B0DF-C6CFD074BF67:e39c9dfb-278e-4666-bf58-727d7187c1f7" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/IMG_14508x6.JPG" title="Another view of the AirTurn Team!" rel="thumbnail"><img border="0" src="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/IMG_1450.png" width="410" height="351" /></a></div>  <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:8747F07C-CDE8-481f-B0DF-C6CFD074BF67:5407e9d9-c24e-4bfe-b02b-a2379b70146f" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/IMG_14518x6.JPG" title="Closeup of the AirTurn table, featuring a netbook on a laptop stand and an HP Tablet PC, both running MusicReader" rel="thumbnail"><img border="0" src="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/IMG_1451.png" width="410" height="386" /></a></div>  <div class="wlWriterEditableSmartContent" id="scid:8747F07C-CDE8-481f-B0DF-C6CFD074BF67:06bed867-3b9a-4e66-8f65-54b740a2d53c" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; float: none; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/UnpackingtheMTNA2009ExhibitorsConvention_E00F/IMG_14538x6.JPG" title="Lookee here!

<description><![CDATA[<p>Last week's &quot;<a href="http://exponentialmusician.com">Exponential Musician</a>&quot; workshop in Malvern, PA for the Main Line Music Teachers Association was an absolute blast!&#160; There's nothing quite like being in a room full of participants and seeing enthusiastic light bulbs glow as folks start to realize the amazing possibilities that technology can offer to enhance the pedagogy, performance, and practice of music!</p>  <p>Here are some pictures from the workshop, graciously taken by Diane Bull (thanks Diane!):</p>  <p><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1397.jpg"><img title="IMG_1397" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="304" alt="IMG_1397" src="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1397_thumb.jpg" width="404" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Here's a shot of the setup as it was being put together.&#160; From L to R: Shure telescoping mic stand, projector screen, Sanyo theater projector (which didn't end up being used, as i forgot to bring the VGA cables! DOH!), my backup HP mini projector (whew), Bose L1 Cylindrical Loudspeaker, piano, Sager Laptop on a Laptop Tripod, HP Laptop on piano, Blue Snowball USB mic (connected to the Sager, which served as the main presentation computer)</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1404.jpg"><img title="IMG_1404" style="border-right: 0px;

It's nice not to be stuck in a linear presentation format!&#160; BTW, that's a brand new AirTurn polo shirt i'm wearing ;)</p>  <p></p>  <p><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1407.jpg"><img title="IMG_1407" style="border-right: 0px;

Here's a picture of me working with student Mary Mox on the &quot;Reverie&quot; by Debussy, using Audacity to visualize the audio recorded via the Blue Snowball USB microphone into the computer.&#160; By learning to recognize peaks and dynamic shapes in audio wave files, it was amazing to see how much faster Mary was able to correct herself to achieve a particular expressive effect!</p>   <p><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1424cropped.jpg"><img title="IMG_1424-cropped" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="186" alt="IMG_1424-cropped" src="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1424cropped_thumb.jpg" width="244" align="left" border="0" /></a> </p>  <p>Here i demonstrate what we're looking for, recording myself on a separate track to compare with the other &quot;takes&quot;.&#160; Again, the visual feedback provides a powerful pedagogical tool to help students take on what i call the &quot;3rd perspective&quot; - in other words, being able to objectively hear what the audience hears from a performance without any physical distractions.&#160; While we might &quot;feel&quot; a certain dynamic effect, such as a crescendo by tensing up muscles and moving our body in such a way, it can be surprising to learn how little of that translates into what is actually heard by the audience - or, in this case, the microphone.</p>   <p>Another tool used was my netbook's webcam, to demonstrate how easy it is to capture quick videos at different angles, specifically to help students see their own posture and physical affectations that might be having an effect on their playing.&#160; Again, it's one thing to see it from your own point of view seated at the piano (or looking into the mirror for another instrumentalist), but it's another thing entirely to view yourself from angles that can really reveal what your hands, arms and shoulders are doing.</p>  <p><a href="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1434.jpg"><img title="IMG_1434" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="184" alt="IMG_1434" src="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1434_thumb.jpg" width="244" align="left" border="0" /></a></p>  <p></p>  <p>Working with another student, Becky Hood, on Debussy's &quot;Dr. Gradus ad Parnassum&quot; from his &quot;Children's Corner&quot; suite.&#160; The goal is to help students use technological tools to become their own teachers by giving them multi-sensory ways to hear and see what's going on in their performance.&#160; </p>    <p>&#160;</p> <a href="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1437cropped.jpg"><img title="IMG_1437-cropped" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px; border-left: 0px; border-bottom: 0px" height="229" alt="IMG_1437-cropped" src="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1437cropped_thumb.jpg" width="244" align="left" border="0" /></a>   <p>Here's another student, Miranda Liu, as we work on a Bach Invention (you can see the score being projected on the screen behind her, using MusicReader).&#160; In this instance, we saw how using digital music readers can free up students and teachers from the limitations of ink and paper, particularly when it comes to dynamically annotating scores.&#160; With traditional ink and paper, there is an inherent fear of mistakes;&#160; what i mean by this is that you are limited to using erasable pencils which aren't always as visually vivid to be truly useful, and using color inks or markers requires a level of &quot;perfection&quot; in the annotation, since you can't erase ink.&#160; \</p>  <p>With digital ink, there is no fear of putting the wrong color or marking down, as all annotations are non-destructive.&#160; It's as easy to erase as it is to mark, so that there is more encouragement to play in the musical &quot;sandbox&quot;, as it were - coloring the motif in the right hand in red, perhaps, then trying to color the motif in the left hand in blue.&#160; Made a mistake and colored the wrong notes?&#160; No problem with a digital score!&#160; When mistakes aren't fear-inducing but transformed into valuable learning tools, students can be encouraged to be more exploratory and experimental in their study of the score.</p>  <p>We had a wonderful turnout and a yummy lunch afterwards, with several teachers asking for another workshop soon (many of them expressing a particular interest in exploring Audacity more).&#160; </p> <a href="http://hughsung.com/images/TheExponentialMusicianinMalvernPA_81A5/IMG_1445cropped.jpg"><img title="IMG_1445-cropped" style="border-right: 0px; border-top: 0px; display: inline; border-left: 0px;

Boulder, Colorado on April 10!&#160; Stay tuned for details!</p>]]>

Michael uses an extra monitor attached to his Tablet PC's VGA-out port to enable the 2nd pianist to see the score comfortably.  What a clever solution!  Certainly cheaper than the screen real estate from a $3000 17 in. MacBook Pro that i'm insanely mulling over...<br />

 <title>What if...?</title>
 <link>http://hughsung.com/blog/index.php?itemid=1079?a=b</link>
<description><![CDATA[Using a computer to read music, i get tons of questions all the time from fellow musicians about potential disasters - what if the computer "crashes"?  What if the power dies?  What if the screen freezes?<br />
<br />
Well, here's a viola-esque response to the endless "what if's" to show that musicial disasters aren't always "hi-tech" in nature:<br />
