<title>Two Women Travellers</title>
<itunes:author>Jim Low</itunes:author>
<itunes:subtitle> Two Women who experienced the life of the swaggie</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> The image of the swaggie, that itinerant soul who walked the roads and tracks of the land in search of work, features prominently in Australiaâ€™s stories, songs and poetry. But the swaggies we mainly read and sing about are men. In this episode I introduce you to Charcoal Annie and Syrian Mary, two women who experienced the life of the swaggie. Although very little is known about them, I share the information I have gathered over the years. Included are songs I've written about each of these extraordinary ladies.
