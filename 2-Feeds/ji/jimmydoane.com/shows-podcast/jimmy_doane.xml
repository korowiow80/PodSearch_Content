	  <description>Road trip with Jimmy and guests, Counselor Curtis and Engineer Erik discuss- Ok, so this is not a normal show. We did a little road trip out to look at some lakefront property so we recorded a show in the car. The explanation is that we started talking about what kind of plane would be cool to have so we could make an escape when necessary. We also talked about some computer stuff because the Counselor has computer issues that cannot be explained. Then we discuss cocaine submarines and how that may lead to affordable personal submarines for the rest of us. Some notes on government regulation, Wall Street protests, Hall of Whispers, Back to government regulations, Credit default Swap thing, Crashes and Panics book, Fort Knox gold, Geraldo Rivera and Al Capone’s vault, Yes, Jimmy’s suicide addendum.
Not much can be done about the audio.</description>

      <description>This show was done before the levy breaks were reported in N.O. An economic forcast -  
Trying to control an economy is like trying to control a living hurricane - Looting 
is criminal, Gouging is voluntary - Hazlitt's Broken Window - Iraq revisited - 1 
reason only to war, and that is Defense - As bad as the storm is, even a chumpy nuke would 
be 1000 times worse.</description>
