      <title>PodPudding Show 8 :P</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/5036/600x600_623347.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here we are at Show 8! We've got some great music in store for you.

Today's featured act are Park Police, a trio with a straight forward, no nonsense rock approach to their song writing. Check them out at www.park-police.com

Instead of one Sneak Leak artist, we decided to treat you to two great acts. The first is known as Jupiter Crash and the second is a band called Head. Both are hard rockin' bands that leave you wanting more. 

Lastly, we've been given another &quot;pre-master&quot; song by our dear friend Raven. It continues in his tradition of Native American compositions with a song called Cedars Forever. Thank you, Raven! 

Here's the play list:

Down With Control - Park Police

Nation Wide            - Park Police

Reflex                      - Park Police

Mission Song         - Park Police

Dark Surprise         - Jupiter Crash

Harder To Fine      - Head

Cedars Forever     - Raven

Lead out song is &quot;To My Father&quot; by Raven. 

As always, we hope you've enjoyed our show and welcome your comments and suggestion. Also, remember if you're an indie, or, unsigned act send us your music, bio and contact information to &quot;podpudding@gmail.com&quot;. 

Thank you for listening!

      <title>PodPudding Show 7</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/5036/600x600_623348.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it's been a while, but so worth the wait! Here's Show 7 for the whole world to relish. The featured artist is Dylan Donkin ( www.dylandonkin.com &amp; www.myspace.com/dylandonkin ) of the U.S along with a 'sneak leak' of a band from Show 8 currently in production named Park Police also from the U.S.

Though difficult to actually categorize, Dylan's music appears to have derived influences ranging from Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Elliot Smith and the Beatles. Yet, it's a copy of none. His music stands on it's own. We've been lucky to have received an advance copy of his EP titled &quot;Food For Thoughtlessness&quot; and we're playing it in it's entirety for you.
Here's the play list:

1) Diatom Blues - Dylan Donkin

2) Make A Choice - Dylan Donkin

3) The Commonaut - Dylan Donkin

4) Mission Song - Park Police

5) Fall Through The Wall - Dylan Donkin

6) Yolk - Dylan Donkin

And the lead out song ( which was initially featured on PodPudding Show 1 ) is &quot;Open Skies&quot; by Parikrima from India.

      <title>PodPudding Show 5</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/5036/600x600_623350.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the 5th show of PodPudding. It's been a very rewarding experience doing these shows and the best part is we've only begun! Along the way we've been making some great friends and have discovered some fantastic music. A great example of that are the acts we've featured in this show. In fact, we had a difficult time choosing which of their tunes to not put on. After recording the whole show, we went back, edited it and put in another song from Menwhopause which originally had been excluded. Though this decision resulted in a longer show, we felt it was the right choice. 

Here's the playlist:

Menwhopause ( &quot;www.menwhopause.com&quot; ) : Flyaway, Traveling Blues
                          					        
James Starbuck : ( &quot;www.jamessarbuck.com&quot; ) : Thank you

Menwhopause   : The Story Begins, Father Monologue

To all unsigned / indie rock bands out there, keep sending us your music and demo packages so that we may feature YOU! For more info, please check out our site at &quot;www.freewebs.com/podpudding&quot;. Our e-mail is &quot;podpudding@gmail.com&quot;.

Thanks for listening!!!
