      <title>Episode 13 - To Whom the Race is Given</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1225299/600x600_2366371.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was jogging this past weekend and the temperature was about 40 degrees and the wind was blowing briskly and as I continued to run, the flat terrain started to incline and the wind picked up more, causing my eyes to tear a bit.  And what began to be a leisurely and effortless jog, ended up as a grueling, battle to finish.  But what I knew throughout the run, as I know each time I go jogging is that I won&#8217;t quit running.  I won&#8217;t stop until I reach the end.  It didn&#8217;t matter that I started off at a fast pace and it seemed I would improve my running time, better than before, and now I&#8217;m slowing down my pace, because I&#8217;m experiencing discomfort, and light pain throughout my body, as I feel the impact of every step.  For what truly matter is that I have a mind to hold on, and endure this run to the end.  The same is true for this Christian race, as the bible says in Eccl 9:11 &quot;I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all. Eccl 9:11&quot;  Beloved the race, the battle... is given to him that endure to the end. </description>

But as many labor, often times they lose sight that the work is for the Christ, and it is he that should be exalted for the manifestation of the Spirit of God.  Beloved I want to remind you that we are nothing of our own selves, nor can we do anything without the hand of God; and you must never think yourself to be something, for as Paul said to the church in Gal 6:3, &quot;For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself&quot;.

      <title>Episode 11 - What do you Expect</title>

We labor until that great day, when the Lord shall return for us and say well done thy good and faithful servant, enter into my rest.  And like a child believes the promise of their parents,so do we also believe the word of God, and the promises of the Lord Jesus Christ; and we expect to see him one day in the Kingdom of Heaven.  For if we expect our earthly father to give us what we ask; enduring love and precious things that we desire, then truly we trust that the Lord will give us even more.  As the bible says in Matt 7:11 &#8220;If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him? We expect to receive the precious gift of the Holy Ghost, if we repent and be baptized in the name of the Jesus Christ for the remission of our sins. And the spirit of the Lord, the Holy Ghost, the Comforter will abide with us always, and teach us all things and bring all his word to our remembrance ~ John 14:26.  This is our eternal hope, for we are saved by this hope;  And this is what we expect from the Lord, for we trust his word and his promise; and the word of God says the Lord hast magnified his word above his name.</description>

Indeed the Lord Jesus Christ is worthy to be praised forever, for he died for us all, that we might be saved from sin and death.  And the bible says when he rose from the dead he took the sting out of death, and through him he gave us victory over death and the grave.  So as the word of God proclaims, in PS 113; &quot;Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. 3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the LORD'S name is to be praised&quot;.</description>

And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve&quot;. ~Luke 4:5-8

Today the devil&#8217;s offer still stands as he tempts man everyday with the cares of this life. And unlike the Lord Jesus Christ, who rebuked Satan, so many have chosen to worship the devil, that this world will be yours.</description>

      <title>Episode 7 - No Spots Allowed</title>

It is a glorious invitation that the Lord has given us all, even though we are unworthy of his everlasting love and wonderful grace; his righteous hand that he promise will never forsake us, but will be with us until the end of the world. Most often an invitation is presented with details of the event, usually the time, location, perhaps what you should bring, should you choose to attend and what the attire will be; in other words, how you should appear at the event.

Well it is also true with the invitation that God has given unto us; God commanded it in the beginning and even now, that his sacrifices unto him be pure, holy, whiter than snow&#8230;and with no spots. No spots allowed.

      <itunes:summary>Jesus said &quot;Come now, and let us reason together...though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool ~Isaiah 1:18. It is a glorious invitation that the Lord has given us all, even though we are unworthy of his everlasting love and wonderful grace; his righteous hand that he promise will never forsake us, but will be with us until the end of the world. Most often an invitation is presented with details of the event, usually the time, location, perhaps what you should bring, should you choose to attend and what the attire will be; in other words, how you should appear at the event.

Well it is also true with the invitation that God has given unto us; God commanded it in the beginning and even now, that his sacrifices unto him be pure, holy, whiter than snow&#8230;and with no spots. No spots allowed.

But so many of those same people who choose not to serve the Lord, are quick to call on the name of the Lord, when faced with great despair and trouble in their life. And beloved I know it seems that these ungodly and unthankful souls are mocking your father, the Lord Jesus Christ. But be not deceived, God is not mocked. No, the Savior is not mocked. For whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that soweth to his flesh, and the lustful things in this world, shall reap corruption.  The Savior is not Mocked.</description>

And it seems to be a fair and even just act, to those that are pleased with what they receive, whether they truly deserve to be rewarded or not. You won't hear a well paid person complain about making too much money or that they're not worthy of what they are rewarded, whether they're worth it or not; For this is the way of an unjust world. But I believe the word of God to be true, and it is written &quot;Yea Let God be true, but every man a liar&quot;, and I believe, if I am faithful to God unto death, as he promised in his word; then I shall receive a crown of life;  You will receive a Just reward.</description>
