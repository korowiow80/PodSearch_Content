            <title>Wisconsin Shows Waning Clout Of Teachers Unions    6.5.12</title>
            <description>Organized Labor: If there&apos;s one lesson from the Wisconsin recall, it&apos;s that unions are in big trouble. This is especially true of teachers&apos; unions, which are being challenged by the public as never before.

A new poll from Harvard&apos;s Program on Education Policy and Governance and Education Next found the share of Americans with a positive view of teachers unions fell from 29% last year to 22% this year, a significant drop.

Writing in the Wall Street Journal, survey authors Paul Peterson, William Howell and Martin West noted that teachers unions are losing favor even among their own members.

It&apos;s no exaggeration to say public anger at teachers unions and the dysfunctional school systems they control is largely behind reform efforts like Wisconsin&apos;s.

Teachers unions have seen their power curtailed sharply under Gov. Scott Walker&apos;s reforms, as the state struggles to regain control over runaway government spending and deficits.

For instance, Wisconsin has ended the practice of mandatory union membership for public employees. It has also curbed collective-bargaining rights. The financial impact has been immense.

Wisconsin school districts once had to buy their teacher insurance contracts from a union-run monopoly — a huge drain on local budgets. Now, they buy them competitively, saving an estimated $1 billion.

Meanwhile, individual Wisconsin teachers are opting out of union membership. The American Federation of Teachers-Wisconsin, representing 17,000 teachers, has lost 6,000 members since the reforms began.

            <title>Facts Get In The Way–Again–Of A Good Global Warming Story    6.5.12</title>
            <description>Environment: Hillary Clinton made a well-publicized trip last week to the Arctic to see for herself the impact of global warming. Less well known, however, are two reports that contradict the climate-change alarmists.

Upon her return from Saturday&apos;s tour of the Norwegian coastline, the secretary of state announced that &quot;many of the predictions about warming in the Arctic are being surpassed by the actual data.&quot; But she omitted a couple of important points:

First, polar ice is now the heaviest &quot;in more than a decade,&quot; reports the Los Angeles Times. It is, in fact, so plentiful it could postpone Shell&apos;s &quot;start of offshore oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean until the beginning of August.&quot;

The Times says the National Weather Service explains it in these terms: &quot;A high pressure zone over the coast of Alaska, cold winter temperatures and certain ocean currents have combined to bring unusually large amounts of ice not only along Alaska&apos;s northern coast, but farther south in the Bering Sea as well.&quot;

Second, photos taken in the 1930s by Danish explorers &quot;show glaciers in Greenland retreating faster than they are today, according to researchers,&quot; tech publication The Register reported.

&quot;It now appears that the glaciers were retreating even faster 80 years ago&quot; when man&apos;s carbon output was far less than today&apos;s, &quot;but nobody worried about it, and the ice subsequently came back again.&quot;

            <title>Media Fig-Leaf President&apos;s Pothead Past   6.5.12</title>
            <description>Journalism: It&apos;s quite a story when pro-Obama bias becomes so blatant, even media elite point it out. Such is the case with coverage of new details about his past habitual drug use.

Two former Washington Post and New York Times reporters have published a scathing indictment of their ex-employers&apos; double standard in reporting on the early lives of Obama and GOP White House hopeful Mitt Romney.

Center stage is biographer David Maraniss&apos; new book, &quot;Barack Obama: The Story.&quot; He reveals our president was a total pothead in high school and college. But not just any pothead. Seems Obama was an overachiever in that department.

Not content with inhaling from a joint, he invented a technique dubbed &quot;total absorption,&quot; whereby he closed the windows of his car and took &quot;roof hits.&quot;

Obama scored such great weed from his dealer, &quot;Ray,&quot; that he cheekily thanked him in his high school yearbook. One of his close friends was arrested for drug possession in high school. A college roommate became a drug addict.

Yet these sordid details were buried by the Times. The nation&apos;s &quot;paper of record&quot; dispensed with them in a brief on Page A15.

Just days later, however, the Times splashed across Page 1 a big story on the Romneys&apos; penchant for expensive horses. The Sunday spread, which depicted the equestrian Romneys as out of touch with the mainstream, ran more than 2,300 words.

The Post employs Maraniss and easily could have excerpted the entire chapter on Obama&apos;s high times. Yet what he unearthed never even made the front page of the paper. His editor instead tucked his pot-smoking scoop back on Page A6.

            <title>TwilightOf The Petrotyrants As Investors Vote With Their Feet   6.5.12</title>
            <description>Business: This week BP announced it wanted to pull its $30 billion investment out of Russia, while a huge Canadian uranium miner said it wanted to bail out of Argentina. Yes, it&apos;s a cause-and-effect message — even for tyrants.

When Russia&apos;s President Vladimir Putin was re-elected last March in a tainted election marked by violence, commentators put their best face forward by saying that at least there would be stability, which was all foreign investors wanted.

Pay no attention to those human rights violations, the profits to be made from the high price of oil would override Putin&apos;s rough edges and firms would invest.

Likewise in Argentina, the re-election of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner as president last October was heralded as continuity, and the excellent opportunities for energy extraction would override her government&apos;s fiscal fiddling, phony statistics, thefts of private pensions, violations of contracts, anti-American rhetoric and other outrages.

Well, this week, it seems some huge investors have had enough, announcing they are pulling out of these resource-rich countries despite their potential.

BP announced it wants to sell its stake in TNK-BP, worth $30 billion, nearly a third of its production and a quarter of its reserves, because Russia&apos;s investment climate was unbearable. BP&apos;s government-linked partners — billionaires known as &quot;oligarchs&quot; — want to cannibalize BP&apos;s businesses abroad, and harassed it with lawsuits while the government stood by, seeking a reason to grab the assets before BP could even sell them.

Such behavior is why capital outflows are reaching record levels in Russia this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that $35.1 billion in capital fled the country in the first quarter, double the $19.8 billion that fled a year ago. All told, $80.5 billion left the country in 2011, the second-highest outflow since 1994.

            <title>CBO Refutes Obama&apos;s Slippery Spending Claims   6.5.12</title>
            <description>Fiscal Policy: Congress&apos; budget watchdogs warn that debt could be double our GDP in 25 years. Avoiding this disaster requires public-sector contraction and private-sector growth, neither of which interests President Obama.

The White House&apos;s absurd claims that growth in federal spending under this president is lower than every president since Eisenhower was too much for even the lapdogs in the Washington press corps.

The Washington Post&apos;s &quot;Fact Checker&quot; column last month gave Obama &quot;three Pinocchios&quot; for the claim, charging that on the last three budgets, &quot;in every case, the president wanted to spend more money than he ended up getting&quot; from Congress.

Under Obama, government expenditures have &quot;hit highs not seen since the end of World War II,&quot; the Post noted. The Associated Press similarly debunked what it called the &quot;rosy claim&quot; touted by the White House.

Enter the Congressional Budget Office, adding insight to Obama&apos;s self-inflicted injury, warning that by year&apos;s end &quot;federal debt will exceed 70% of GDP — the highest percentage since shortly after World War II&quot; (see chart). Such massive new debt will mean higher interest rates and &quot;also would increase the probability of a sudden fiscal crisis,&quot; according to the CBO.

            <title>The Lowlights Of Obamanomics  6.4.12</title>
            <description>The Obama Record: May&apos;s weak jobs report further confirms the president&apos;s policies are failing to help the economy. This is, indeed, the worst recovery since the Depression.

Negative superlatives associated with this presidency keep piling up. The toll so far:

• The share of Americans who&apos;ve been out of work a long time — now at 42% of the unemployed — is the highest since the Great Depression (source: Labor Department).

• The proportion of the civilian working-age population actually working, at 58%, is the smallest since the Carter era (Labor Department).

• Growth in nonfarm payroll jobs since the recovery began in June 2009 is the slowest of any comparable recovery since World War II (Hoover Institution).

• The rate of new business startups — the engine of job growth — has plunged to an all-time low of 7.87% of all businesses (Census Bureau).

• 3 in 10 young adults can&apos;t find jobs and live with their parents, highest since the 1950s (Pew Research).

• 54% of bachelor&apos;s degree-holders under the age of 25 are jobless or underemployed, the highest share in decades (Northeastern University).

• Black teen unemployment, now at 37%, is near Depression-era highs (Labor Department).

            <itunes:summary>The Obama Record: May&apos;s weak jobs report further confirms the president&apos;s policies are failing to help the economy. This is, indeed, the worst recovery since the Depression.

Negative superlatives associated with this presidency keep piling up. The toll so far:

• The share of Americans who&apos;ve been out of work a long time — now at 42% of the unemployed — is the highest since the Great Depression (source: Labor Department).

• The proportion of the civilian working-age population actually working, at 58%, is the smallest since the Carter era (Labor Department).

• Growth in nonfarm payroll jobs since the recovery began in June 2009 is the slowest of any comparable recovery since World War II (Hoover Institution).

• The rate of new business startups — the engine of job growth — has plunged to an all-time low of 7.87% of all businesses (Census Bureau).

• 3 in 10 young adults can&apos;t find jobs and live with their parents, highest since the 1950s (Pew Research).

• 54% of bachelor&apos;s degree-holders under the age of 25 are jobless or underemployed, the highest share in decades (Northeastern University).

• Black teen unemployment, now at 37%, is near Depression-era highs (Labor Department).</itunes:summary>

            <title>Sorry Krugman, Reagan Was No Keynesian   6.4.12</title>
            <description>Economics: When does respect for an economic theory become fanaticism? For an answer, check out Paul Krugman&apos;s increasingly desperate attempts to defend Keynesian economics against its obvious failures.

The New York Times columnist doesn&apos;t claim publicly to be a religious man, but he sure acts like it when it comes to his beloved John Maynard Keynes. Anything that detracts from Keynes&apos; demand-side, big government, deficit-fueled stimulus gospel is verboten. And any evidence that Keynesianism doesn&apos;t work must be wiped away, even if it means conjuring up mythical numbers to do so.

Case in point is Krugman&apos;s latest campaign to argue that, despite an $830 billion stimulus and trillion-dollar-plus annual deficits, President Obama has been an austerity-driven tightwad. At the same time, Krugman says President Reagan — whose supply-side, free-market economic policies powered a huge recovery after the 1981-82 recession — was a closet Keynesian.

&quot;If you actually look at the actual track record of government spending (and) government employment,&quot; Krugman said this weekend, &quot;Reagan is the Keynesian and Obama ... has been the anti-Keynesian.&quot;

Well, let&apos;s check the actual record.

Real spending at the end of Reagan&apos;s first term was up 9.7% compared with the year before he took office. Under Obama, that figure will be above 16%, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget.

While spending did top out 23.5% of GDP in 1983, Reagan cut it to 22% the next year, and still lower after that. Under Obama, spending shot up to 25% of GDP in 2009, and it&apos;s stayed at or above 24% since.

Deficits in Reagan&apos;s two terms never exceeded 6% of GDP. Under Obama, they&apos;ve never been under 8%.

            <title>Obama Doctrine: Speak Loudly And Carry A Puny Stick   6.4.12</title>
            <description>U.S. Power: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced a U.S. strategic shift to the Pacific. It makes sense. What doesn&apos;t is doing it in the biggest drawdown since Jimmy Carter.

U.S. Power: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta announced a strategic shift in U.S. military resources toward the Asia-Pacific. It makes sense. What doesn&apos;t is doing it amid the biggest U.S. military drawdown since the Jimmy Carter era. &apos;The United States is at a strategic turning point after a decade of war,&quot; Leon Panetta told defense representatives of 26 nations who had gathered in Singapore for an annual summit on regional security.

&quot;In this century, the United States recognizes that our prosperity and our security depends even more on the Asia-Pacific region,&quot; Panetta said, citing its huge populations, giant economies and growing militaries up and down the Rim.

&quot;Given these trends, President Obama has stated the United States will play a larger role in this region over the decades to come.&quot; That would mean shifting 60% of U.S. Naval forces from Europe and other regions to the Pacific by 2020.

Make no mistake, Panetta&apos;s announcement represents a sound strategy, given that U.S. naval supremacy has been key in the peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific, whose success is a beacon for the world.

Ever since the U.S. victory at the Battle of Midway, U.S. naval power has been supreme, fostering the rise of Japan as a trading nation and the emergence of Southeast Asia&apos;s Tiger States after the Vietnam War, with, ironically, Vietnam now joining them.

Unfortunately, the shift looks only symbolic — the opposite of Theodore Roosevelt&apos;s &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick.&quot;

            <title>Justice Department Is Already In Axelrod&apos;s Pocket    6.4.12</title>
            <description>Justice: A new book has Attorney General Eric Holder gallantly protecting the Justice Department from Obama political tactician David Axelrod&apos;s influence. In fact, if these two operatives exchanged jobs, few would notice.

The big revelation in Newsweek writer Daniel Klaidman&apos;s new book &quot;Kill or Capture&quot; is that David Axelrod, White House senior adviser and now Obama re-election campaign communications director, had a loud confrontation with Holder about political interference with Justice Department activities.

Those reading the headlines about &quot;a war within the White House&quot; might be tempted to think this is a damaging revelation about an executive branch in disarray.

Wrong: It&apos;s another case of the lamestream media being utilized by their friendly Obama sources to make Obama look good.

Just look at the picture Klaidman paints. Holder and Axelrod going at it chest to chest after a cabinet meeting, finally having to be separated by longtime Friend-of-Barack Valerie Jarrett.

Their scrap was purportedly over Axelrod wanting a political operative placed on staff at Justice, presumably to mop up or prevent fallout from Holder&apos;s unpopular departmental doings.

            <title>Obama Leaks Risk National Security For Political Gain    6.4.12</title>
            <description>Security: From leaks about Osama bin Laden to those detailing cyberattacks on Iran, a disturbing pattern of publicly disclosing classified material to give Barack Obama a political boost is emerging. Under this president, our enemies don&apos;t need spies.

The fact that the Allies in World War II had the ability to intercept and decode German and Japanese military transmissions, leading to critical military victories at Midway and elsewhere, remained a secret until long after World War II was over, and it didn&apos;t matter who knew it. &quot;Loose lips sink ships&quot; was then more than a clever wartime slogan.

The pattern of national security leaks under this administration and its political exploitation of what should be secret has even liberal media flagship CNN wondering if &quot;President Barack Obama&apos;s administration can keep a secret — or in some cases even wants to.&quot;

With a collapsing economy, rampant joblessness and mushrooming debt, foreign policy seemingly is the only place Obama can boast of any accomplishments.

Yes, Osama bin Laden was killed on his watch. Yet even there, critics say with much merit that the world&apos;s most wanted man was killed while Obama was president, not because he was president.

We&apos;re all too familiar with Obama&apos;s very public celebration after the bin Laden kill, to the point of giving tours of the Situation Room and granting special access to information and people to Hollywood filmmakers. A 17-minute campaign flick was even made.

&quot;Too many people in too many places are talking too much about this operation,&quot; Robert Gates said last year when he was defense secretary, adding that the level of disclosures and blabbing violates an agreement reached in the White House Situation Room on May 8, 2011, to keep details of the raid private.

&quot;That lasted about 15 hours,&quot; Gates said sourly.

            <title>Banks Forced To Buy Government Debts–The Next Crisis?    6.1.12</title>
            <description>Finance: Governments in the U.S. and Europe are forcing private banks to buy up government debts — debts that may turn sour down the road, decimating banks&apos; balance sheets. This is a recipe for another financial crisis.

It has become an enduring national myth — repeated dutifully by Democratic politicians and their mainstream media lapdogs in recent years — that commercial banks &quot;caused&quot; the financial crisis.

They didn&apos;t.

Even so, banks are still demonized for it. Because of this, they&apos;re now being forced to buy the bad debts of our out-of-control federal government.

This has become a pattern. Remember in the 1990s when banks were assailed for supposedly refusing to lend to minorities. The White House and Congress, then controlled by Democrats, weighed in, using sweeping new regulations and political threats to force banks to lend to people who could not pay back their loans.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development got involved. So did the Federal Reserve. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac poured trillions of dollars into the housing market. It was a Democratic dream — a market driven entirely by government whim.

Subprime lending surged, all the way until the market inevitably crashed in 2008. Then the very same people who created the mess — Rep. Barney Frank, Sen. Chris Dodd, then-Sen. Barack Obama, among others — blamed the banks when it all collapsed.

The ultimate cost to the economy: at least 5.6 million jobs and an estimated $1.2 trillion in lost GDP.

            <title>Obama (Again) Blames Bush For Bad Job News  6.1.12</title>
            <description>Economy: President Obama has been on the job for nearly three and a half years, but the White House says bad news on jobs is George W. Bush&apos;s fault. Time to own up to your own record, Mr. President.

It was the most tepid job growth seen in America in a year, with fewer than 70,000 jobs added for May — less than half what economists expected.

On top of that, March and April&apos;s combined job growth was revised downward by almost 50,000. The unemployment rate is again going in the wrong direction, from April&apos;s 8.1% to 8.2% in May.

In response to the jobs report, the Dow industrials plunged more than 274 points, or 2.2%, the index&apos;s worst day of the year and falling into negative territory for 2012.

Welcome to the Obama &quot;recovery.&quot;

The White House says this economy isn&apos;t really the president&apos;s responsibility. Its take on what the Washington Post called a &quot;dismal U.S. jobs report&quot; as &quot;businesses dramatically scaled back hiring,&quot; was this from Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Alan Krueger:

&quot;Today we learned that the economy has added private sector jobs for 27 straight months&quot; — as if lukewarm net job growth that&apos;s actually slower than the growth in the labor force should be a cause to break out the champagne in the biggest economy in the world.

            <itunes:summary>Economy: President Obama has been on the job for nearly three and a half years, but the White House says bad news on jobs is George W. Bush&apos;s fault. Time to own up to your own record, Mr. President.

It was the most tepid job growth seen in America in a year, with fewer than 70,000 jobs added for May — less than half what economists expected.

On top of that, March and April&apos;s combined job growth was revised downward by almost 50,000. The unemployment rate is again going in the wrong direction, from April&apos;s 8.1% to 8.2% in May.

In response to the jobs report, the Dow industrials plunged more than 274 points, or 2.2%, the index&apos;s worst day of the year and falling into negative territory for 2012.

Welcome to the Obama &quot;recovery.&quot;

The White House says this economy isn&apos;t really the president&apos;s responsibility. Its take on what the Washington Post called a &quot;dismal U.S. jobs report&quot; as &quot;businesses dramatically scaled back hiring,&quot; was this from Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Alan Krueger:

&quot;Today we learned that the economy has added private sector jobs for 27 straight months&quot; — as if lukewarm net job growth that&apos;s actually slower than the growth in the labor force should be a cause to break out the champagne in the biggest economy in the world.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Wisconsin Showdown Pits Unions Against Taxpayers    6.1.12</title>
            <description>Labor Vs. Taxpayers: Public-sector unions have had it their way for decades. That will change — and not just in one state — if Scott Walker survives Tuesday&apos;s recall vote.

Does Wisconsin matter? To hear some recent spin from Barack Obama&apos;s campaign, not as much as you would think.

Voters there on Tuesday will be deciding the political fate of Republican Gov. Walker, along with lieutenant governor and four state senators, in the state&apos;s first-ever statewide recall election. The combatants have spent an estimated $60 million so far. It looks to us like a mighty big deal, with big implications for national politics.

But Obama&apos;s deputy campaign manager, Stephanie Cutter, said the recall will have no bearing on the presidential election.

&quot;This is a gubernatorial race with a guy who was recalled and a challenger trying to get him out of office,&quot; she sold MSNBC. &quot;It has nothing to do with President Obama at the top of the ticket, and it certainly doesn&apos;t have anything to do with Mitt Romney at the top of the Republican ticket.&quot;

That&apos;s literally true, but misleading. Romney and Obama aren&apos;t on Tuesday&apos;s ballot, but let&apos;s not pretend this vote is just a sideshow. It&apos;s the nation&apos;s second most significant election this year. If the presidency isn&apos;t directly at stake on Tuesday, the future of organized labor is. Likewise for the Democratic Party, which depends on union money and members to win elections.

The election to recall Walker and his GOP allies is about one issue — collective bargaining for public employees. You can tune out everything else on the list of alleged sins that the Republicans have committed. If they had left the public-sector unions alone, none of this would be happening.

            <title>Justice Department Encourages Voter Fraud The Chicago Way   6.1.12</title>
            <description>Fixing Elections: Washington has ordered Florida to end its effort to remove ineligible voters from the state&apos;s voter rolls. This is breathtaking. It couldn&apos;t be clearer that the government is actively promoting voter fraud.

Somehow, the DOJ has determined that purging illegal voters — felons, noncitizens, the deceased — from the rolls is a violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act as well as the 1993 National Voter Registration Act. According to the Miami Herald, the department&apos;s lead civil rights attorney, T. Christian Herren Jr., sent the state &quot;a detailed two-page letter&quot; on Thursday demanding that Florida&apos;s elections division shut down its pursuit.

A key passage in the Herald&apos;s story says that those &quot;most likely to face being purged from the rolls&quot; are &quot;independent voters and Democrats.&quot;

If it were Republicans, which the Herald says are the &quot;least likely&quot; group to be scrutinized, Attorney General Eric Holder&apos;s highly politicized Justice Department would be happy to let the purging continue.

What&apos;s missing from Herren&apos;s complaint is the fact that no one is actually moved off the rolls until they are found to be ineligible. Simply sending names to county elections supervisors to confirm eligibility, which is what Florida officials are doing, discriminates against no one. Either the person is eligible to vote or not.

No one is harassed or summarily tossed off the voter rolls. There is no poll tax or literacy test.

            <title>Romney&apos;s Bain Capital Vs. Obama&apos;s Solyndra: Game On  6.1.12</title>
            <description>Industrial Policy: At the NATO Summit, President Obama said his opponent&apos;s private equity success vs. the administration&apos;s failed industrial policy was what this election was all about. Speaking at the bankrupt Solyndra headquarters, his GOP opponent agreed.

It is said a picture is worth a thousand words. The photo of Mitt Romney holding a surprise press conference in front of the headquarters of the bankrupt solar energy firm Solyndra poster may just be worth a good portion of the 270 electoral votes needed for victory in November.

&quot;Two years ago President Obama was here to tout this building and this business as a symbol of the success of his stimulus,&quot; said Romney, stepping off a bus and onto the public sidewalk in front of the Solyndra buildings just outside Silicon Valley. &quot;Well you can see that it&apos;s a symbol of something very different today.&quot;

Indeed, it is a symbol of the failure of the administration&apos;s green energy boondoggle, where over a half billion dollars has been spent to reward donors while subsidizing an uncompetitive company with a doomed business model.

Solyndra, where 1,100 employees lost their &quot;green jobs,&quot; is only one of many green failures that included companies like Beacon Power, First Solar and Ener1, battery maker for President Obama&apos;s fantasy fleet of electric cars.

            <title>Does Anyone Listen to Obama Anymore?   6.1.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: President Obama has been running around lately touting a &quot;to do&quot; list he says must be passed &quot;now&quot; to get the economy rolling. If you haven&apos;t heard about it, don&apos;t worry. Neither have his fellow Democrats.

In early May, Obama started issuing an urgent plea for Congress to pass a short, five-item &quot;to do&quot; list that, he said, had to be done &quot;right now&quot; to &quot;speed up this recovery and to create jobs.&quot;

And throughout the month, he urged &quot;everybody&quot; to &quot;pick up the phone, write an email, tweet, and remind your member of Congress we can&apos;t afford to wait until November to get things done.&quot;

Apparently nobody in the audience bothered, since even Obama&apos;s fellow Democrats are ignoring this list.

In fact, almost a full month after Obama started his latest campaign, not one of the items on his &quot;must do now&quot; list has been scheduled for a vote, according to a report in Roll Call. And just one — some business tax cuts — has made it onto the Senate calendar for June — a calendar set up by Democratic leader Harry Reid.

Democrats are paying so little attention to Obama these days they don&apos;t even have a clue what&apos;s on that list, let alone the sense of urgency Obama has put behind it.

            <title>New York City&apos;s Sugar Nazi Mayor Strikes Again  6.1.12</title>
            <description>Freedom: The Big Apple&apos;s latest ban, following its much-emulated prohibitions on tobacco and trans-fat, is on big sodas. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has supersized himself from nutrition nanny to Sugar Nazi.

Is there anything the Ego That Ate New York won&apos;t make illegal for New Yorkers to consume? Last year, the city prohibited smoking in all of its parks, beaches, swimming pools and pedestrian plazas. A few years earlier, Mayor Bloomberg banned smoking in restaurants, bars and workplaces.

In 2006, New York City began dictating to restaurants that they remove &quot;trans-fat&quot; from their fare. After all, City Council member Peter Vallone declared that &quot;trans-fats kill babies.&quot;

Years ago, scientists were telling us trans fatty acids were better for our health than saturated fats — the way some scientists swerved from warning of a new ice age to demanding action against global warming.

On average, trans-fat amounts to a fraction of total fat consumption. Those same couch potato New Yorkers who now rest easy because the mayor has saved them from a heart attack may be consuming even more deadly saturated fat than before. Their relieved minds may keep them from visiting the cardiologist who finds they need to reduce cholesterol and increase exercise.

            <title>The Private Sector Will Take Us Where No Man Has Gone Before    6.1.12</title>
            <description>Free Enterprise: The SpaceX Dragon capsule is back on Earth, having splashed down in the Pacific Thursday morning. Don&apos;t think this to be a trivial matter. It&apos;s the dawn of a new era of space exploration.

When the Dragon dropped into the water off the Baja California coast, it completed the world&apos;s first private spaceflight. Once the domain of a few governments, space travel is now officially and legitimately open to the private sector.

SpaceX isn&apos;t the only private space travel pioneer.

Virgin Galactic, a piece of Richard Branson&apos;s Virgin Group that considers itself &quot;the world&apos;s first commercial spaceline,&quot; announced Wednesday that it has been granted an experimental launch permit from the Federal Aviation Administration for suborbital flight.

Virgin Galactic President and CEO George Whitesides says the permit takes the company &quot;a major step closer to bringing our customers to space.&quot;

Meanwhile, Washington took a major step away from space when it closed out NASA&apos;s shuttle program and cut the agency&apos;s budget.

            <title>10 Reasons Obama Must Disclose His College Records    6.1.12</title>
            <description>Vetting: Desperate, Obama supporters portray all who look into his past as &quot;birthers.&quot; Now they ridicule efforts to find how a pot-smoking slacker got into Columbia and Harvard.

But Obama&apos;s college records are a legitimate campaign issue. Mysteries abound, chiefly concerning his transfer to Columbia and ascension to Harvard. Voters, moreover, have had the benefit of knowing other recent Democrat White House hopefuls&apos; course work and grades.

If there&apos;s nothing to hide, why not release these academic records?

Why is the White House stonewalling?

An objective press corps ought to be curious. But it has by and large refused to pursue the issue, even though it hectored George W. Bush to release his college transcripts.

Here are 10 reasons the electorate has every right to see Obama&apos;s records:

            <title>Follow Canada To Smaller Government, Stronger Economy    5.30.12</title>
            <description>Economics: Canada had developed a well-earned reputation as a welfare state. But a new understanding has taken root north of the border, and Canadians have pursued some policies the U.S. should also follow.

In the May/June Cato Policy Report, analyst Chris Edwards notes: &quot;In some ways the United States is in even worse fiscal shape today than Canada was two decades ago&quot; when it was suffering through &quot;a deep recession and teetered on the brink of a debt crisis caused by rising government spending.&quot;

Canada stopped its slide. Will America?

As economist Walter Williams pointed out here Wednesday, the rocketing federal debt is 106% of our economy, the highest it&apos;s been since World War II and three times what it was during the 1970s. To say our economy is sluggish is almost to exaggerate.

Making a bleak outlook even harsher is the largest-in-history, economy-crippling tax hike coming in January when the Bush tax cuts expire.

In short, the U.S. cannot continue down its current path and hope to remain the world&apos;s main economic power and global beacon of prosperity. It must reverse course.

It can happen. After years of implementing socialist policies, Canada, as Sweden has done, quietly reversed course in the 1980s, cutting taxes and launching privatization efforts. The tax cuts have acted as a stimulus while privatization, writes Edwards, &quot;reduced government debt and helped spur economic growth by creating a more dynamic industrial structure.&quot;

Canada has pursued, as well, free trade to the benefit of its industries and consumers. It also avoided a housing crisis, such as the meltdown that still plagues the U.S. economy, because the mortgage industry there isn&apos;t pressured by the government to make risky home loans.

            <title>New Yorkers Leave Like East Germans Fled Communism   5.30.12</title>
            <description>Big Government: New York thinks of itself as the place to be, but its high taxes have made it a place to flee. Those who have escaped the Empire State tax man could fill a major city.

From 1949 to 1961, more than 2.6 million of East Germany&apos;s 17 million population escaped to West Berlin or West Germany, a hemorrhage of humanity that led the Communists to construct the infamous Berlin Wall in 1961.

The state of New York, with about 19.5 million people, has no known plans to erect concrete barriers or barbed wire fences. But from 2000 to 2010 it suffered an exodus of some 3.4 million New Yorkers — nearly a million more people than in Germany&apos;s post-war experience and more than that of any other state.

And the outflow hasn&apos;t stopped. The income loss for the state is $45.6 billion, the Tax Foundation says.

Granted, it&apos;s not just one-way traffic. New York has plenty of immigration from abroad; its more than 4 million foreign-born residents give it the second-biggest immigrant population in America.

So net outward migration is about 1.3 million.

Most New York refugees are in sunny, zero-income-tax Florida. The Sunshine State, along with its rays, offer big relief from New York&apos;s state tax on income, which starts at almost 6.5% and reaches nearly 9% for the overly successful.

On top of that are high sales taxes that approach 9% in New York City, but 7% in some other areas.

            <title>Detroit, North Korea, The City Of Broken Lights  5.30.12</title>
            <description>Lost Cities: &quot;Will the last one to leave please turn off the lights?&quot; goes the old joke. In the socialist worker&apos;s paradise that was the Motor City, nearly half the streetlights are broken and the city can&apos;t afford to fix them.

Detroit, the buckle on the Rust Belt that as recently as the 1970s had 1.8 million people, now has only 713,000 in an area of 139 square miles.

It fell victim to one-party Democratic rule and labor unions that made its key industry — auto manufacturing — uncompetitive and financially unstable. Before there was Greece, there was General Motors.

Now Detroit has announced plans to reorganize that could have come right out of Pyongyang.

As Bloomberg reports, some 40% of the city&apos;s 88,000 streetlights are broken, and the city will try to &quot;nudge&quot; people into moving into a smaller, more compact area that can be better maintained.

Mayor Dave Bing proposes to decommission nearly half the city&apos;s lights, including all those in alleys, two-thirds of those in declining neighborhoods and a third of those in more stable neighborhoods.

&quot;You have to identify those neighborhoods where you want to concentrate your population,&quot; said Chris Brown, Detroit&apos;s chief operating officer. &quot;We&apos;re not going to light distressed areas like we light other areas.&quot;

So Detroit residents can continue to reside in sparsely populated unlit areas — or move where the government wants them to move.

            <title>Reasons To Abort Taxpayer Funding Of Planned Parenthood    5.30.12</title>
            <description>Protecting Taxpayers: After having been caught offering advice on how to abort baby girls, Planned Parenthood launched an ad blitz depicting Mitt Romney as anti-woman. How many more reasons do we need to kill federal funding of this group?

Planned Parenthood&apos;s $1.4 million ad campaign says Romney will &quot;deny women the birth control and cancer screenings they depend on&quot; and &quot;he&apos;ll deny women the right to make their own medical decisions.&quot;

Why? Because Romney says he would stop forking over $20 million in tax money to a group that performs nearly a quarter of all abortions in the U.S., and because Romney says he would support the Supreme Court&apos;s reversing Roe v. Wade.

But to equate cutting federal funds for Planned Parenthood to denying women access to cancer screenings is a lie. Ditto the claim that supporting a reversal of Roe v. Wade means women won&apos;t be able to make &quot;their own medical decisions.&quot;

Even the New York Times calls the claims in the ad &quot;misleading.&quot;

But the head of Planned Parenthood&apos;s Action Fund says it&apos;s &quot;just the beginning,&quot; calling the ad &quot;a very small down payment on what we intend to do to make sure people are very clear where the candidates stand.&quot;

Planned Parenthood is the same group that was just caught red-handed on tape advising a woman on how to abort her child if it turns out to be a girl.

            <title>No Bias Here, Says University of California, Just Not Enough Money    5.29.12</title>
            <description>Higher Ed Bias: A new study of the leftward tilt in academia draws the usual response: Pay no attention to our politics — just give us more money. Well, about that money ...

It&apos;s not exactly news that faculties at the University of California, or most universities for that matter, lean to the left. A new study from the California Association of Scholars (CAS) just confirms what any student knows — you don&apos;t get both sides of the story at UC.Even by a liberal state&apos;s standards, it&apos;s a very liberal institution.

The study notes, for instance, that Democrats outnumber Republicans 10 to 1 in the hard sciences, 17 to 1 in the humanities and 21 to 1 in the social sciences at UC Berkeley. The CAS&apos; complaint, spelled out in a recent L.A. Times opinion piece, is that UC professors don&apos;t just vote to the left but that they also push their views — to the exclusion of others — in lectures and reading lists.

Too many courses, it says, are like the UC Santa Barbara sociology class described by one student: &quot;Ten weeks of anti-capitalist, anti-globalization rhetoric.&quot;

The CAS speaks for a dwindling band of center-right scholars who hold to the sound old idea that politics should stay out of the classroom. Sadly, the only audience still listening is outside academia. Within those walls, their analysis is dismissed as offensive to academic freedom (you can&apos;t expect us to lay a political litmus test on professors, can you?) or unscientific.

As UCLA Chancellor Gene Block and Academic Senate Chair Andrew Leuchter said in a letter responding to the study, &quot;The plural of &apos;anecdote&apos; is not &apos;data.&apos;&quot;

            <title>A No Confidence Vote For Obamanomics  5.29.12</title>
            <description>Economy: Consumer confidence took a &quot;surprise&quot; tumble in May, as home prices hit 10-year lows. Tell us again why economists keep calling bad economic news about Obama&apos;s so-called recovery &quot;unexpected&quot;?

Analysts had predicted the Conference Board&apos;s Consumer Confidence Index would climb to 70 in May. Instead it dropped more than four points to 64.9, the biggest drop since last fall.

It&apos;s the latest in another round of disappointing numbers. Just a few weeks ago, new jobs came in &quot;unexpectedly&quot; low. And before that, GDP data disappointed.

Underperforming economic indicators have been so common under Obama that the only mystery is why the experts keep getting caught off guard.

In the case of the Consumer Confidence Index, the current number — bad as it is — doesn&apos;t even tell the whole story.

First, it&apos;s worth noting the index has fallen for three months. Even if it had hit forecasts, it would still be well below 90, which signals a healthy economy.

The current reading is worse when you realize that under President Bush — you know, the guy who Obama says ruined the economy — confidence averaged 88.

That&apos;s despite two recessions, a terrorist massacre and two long wars. Throughout Obama&apos;s &quot;recovery,&quot; the index has averaged 57.

            <itunes:summary>Economy: Consumer confidence took a &quot;surprise&quot; tumble in May, as home prices hit 10-year lows. Tell us again why economists keep calling bad economic news about Obama&apos;s so-called recovery &quot;unexpected&quot;?

Analysts had predicted the Conference Board&apos;s Consumer Confidence Index would climb to 70 in May. Instead it dropped more than four points to 64.9, the biggest drop since last fall.

It&apos;s the latest in another round of disappointing numbers. Just a few weeks ago, new jobs came in &quot;unexpectedly&quot; low. And before that, GDP data disappointed.

Underperforming economic indicators have been so common under Obama that the only mystery is why the experts keep getting caught off guard.

In the case of the Consumer Confidence Index, the current number — bad as it is — doesn&apos;t even tell the whole story.

First, it&apos;s worth noting the index has fallen for three months. Even if it had hit forecasts, it would still be well below 90, which signals a healthy economy.

The current reading is worse when you realize that under President Bush — you know, the guy who Obama says ruined the economy — confidence averaged 88.

That&apos;s despite two recessions, a terrorist massacre and two long wars. Throughout Obama&apos;s &quot;recovery,&quot; the index has averaged 57.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Revisiting Those Denials By Rev. Wright&apos;s Star Parishioner  5.29.12</title>
            <description>The Obama Record: A new book reveals the president and his radical preacher were closer than he ever admitted. The details offer more evidence he&apos;s been misleading the nation since 2008.

Obama&apos;s claim he never once heard Rev. Jeremiah Wright spew anti-white, anti-American venom while spending 20 years at his knee already strained credulity.

&quot;I did not hear such incendiary language myself, personally, either in conversations with him or when I was in the pew,&quot; Obama insisted in 2008. &quot;So I didn&apos;t become familiar with these until recently.&quot;

But the just-released Obama expose, &quot;The Amateur,&quot; makes that almost impossible to believe.

Author-journalist Ed Klein reports that Obama&apos;s ties to Wright ran longer and deeper than previously reported. Their relationship, in fact, started in 1985 — three years before Obama joined Wright&apos;s militant church in Chicago.

While working as a South Side street agitator, Obama often dropped by Wright&apos;s office or home for advice.

&quot;After Barack and I got to know each other,&quot; Wright told Klein, &quot;it got to the point where he would just drop by my church to talk.&quot;

            <title>MSNBC Lets Anti-Military Cat Out Of The Bag  5.29.12</title>
            <description>Valor: The vast majority of Americans understand that those who don the uniform of the United States to protect us are heroes. But an MSNBC pundit, even in &quot;apologizing&quot; for an outrageous statement, doesn&apos;t.

MSNBC&apos;s Chris Hayes let something slip on-air over the Memorial Day weekend that countless others on the left reserve for times when they know the little red light on the TV camera is off — perhaps over some good Maui Wowie with all the windows rolled up in the Choomwagon.

&quot;Thinking and observing Memorial Day that will be happening tomorrow,&quot; Hayes said in a now viral video, &quot;I think it&apos;s interesting because it is, I think, very difficult to talk about the war dead and the fallen without invoking valor, without invoking the word &apos;heroes,&apos; and why do I feel so uncomfortable about the word &apos;hero&apos;?&quot;

According to Hayes, &quot;I feel uncomfortable about the word &apos;hero&apos; because it seems to me that it is so rhetorically proximate to justifications for more war.&quot; Hayes concluded, grinning, that &quot;it seems to me that we marshal this word in a way that is problematic, but maybe I&apos;m wrong about that.&quot;

Maybe? Beginning with the Clinton era, Democratic Party leaders have shrewdly embraced a more-patriotic-than-thou attitude. Hippie mobs taunting, cursing and spitting at returning servicemen and women may have been fashionable during the Vietnam War, but Democratic politicians seeking to be elected into power to weaken our defenses know it&apos;s counterproductive.

            <title>America&apos;s Oil Boom Gets Louder In Alaska   5.25.12</title>
            <description>Oil: President Obama has said that drilling isn&apos;t the path to cheaper gasoline. A rich deposit of crude off Alaska&apos;s north coast not only says that he&apos;s wrong, it indicates that energy independence is more than a mere fantasy.

When gasoline prices were spiking in March, the president said: &quot;We can&apos;t just drill our way to lower gas prices — not when we consume 20% of the world&apos;s oil.&quot;

Each day, the U.S. goes through nearly 20 million barrels of crude. About half is imported. Just beneath the frozen Arctic Ocean on Alaska&apos;s north coast resides an oil field that could eventually produce 1 million barrels a day — roughly 10% of what we import and a bit more than 5% of our daily consumption.

Shell will begin exploratory drilling this summer with the blessings of the hostile-to-fossil fuels, no-drill president, who has blocked the Keystone XL pipeline and sat on illegal off-shore drilling moratoriums. Apparently even he can&apos;t bring himself to block what a New York Times writer, who has exhaustively reported on the Alaska drilling project, described in a recent blog:

&quot;The plan,&quot; writes Clifford Krauss, &quot;offers the promise of greater national energy security, the thinking goes, and economic benefits for Alaskans.&quot;

Just how fertile is this Alaskan field? Fortune magazine believes that &quot;Come fall, the big news out of Barrow may well be America&apos;s largest offshore oil discovery in a generation.&quot;

An additional 1 million barrels a day out of Alaska won&apos;t make the U.S. fully energy independent. But with that much extra crude from a domestic source, we could cut our imports from volatile nations such as Venezuela or Nigeria, and trim the amount we import from Saudi Arabia to almost nothing.

            <title>U.N. Law Of The Sea Treaty Must Be Stopped    5.25.12</title>
            <description>Geopolitics: The administration begins the push for ratification of a 1982 treaty that would end America&apos;s sovereignty on the high seas, limit our freedoms on land and speed up the global redistribution of wealth and power.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Sen. John Kerry&apos;s Senate Foreign Relations Committee last Wednesday that the freedom of the sea once guaranteed by the British Royal Navy and then the U.S. Navy should be in the hands of United Nations bureaucrats in Montego Bay, Jamaica, enforcers of the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST) he said we must ratify.

It used to be that a carrier battle group led by 90,000 tons of American diplomacy was sufficient to ensure that no nation could threaten our freedom of navigation and that of other countries.

But the nation whose motto was &quot;we win, they lose&quot; under President Reagan is replacing it with President Obama&apos;s &quot;mother, may we?&quot;

&quot;If we are not a party to this treaty and can&apos;t deal with it at the table, then we have to deal with it at sea with our naval power, and once that happens, we clearly increase the risk for confrontation,&quot; Panetta told members of the committee.

            <title>Obama Campaign Finding Itself In A Bad Bind On Bain   5.25.12</title>
            <description>Campaign: President Obama claims Mitt Romney fixing lots of companies hurt the economy, while Joe Biden insists he&apos;s &quot;not criticizing private equity firms&quot; like Bain Capital. Call it &quot;Schizophrenia We Can Believe In.&quot;

The Obama campaign has been going after Mitt Romney&apos;s career as a company-fixer at Bain Capital with a vengeance. One Obama ad even featured a fired worker who says you can tell Romney doesn&apos;t care because of &quot;the way he talks.&quot;

But for all the supposed empathy Obama has for the &quot;99%,&quot; more than 8% of them remain unemployed as we approach the end of the president&apos;s first term.

Obama used the term &quot;maximize profits&quot; three times during Monday&apos;s NATO Summit press conference in Chicago.

&quot;I think my view of private equity is that it is set up to maximize profits,&quot; Obama said, proving he hasn&apos;t the vaguest idea what the private equity business does.

Bain Capital and the like may be &quot;a healthy part of the free market,&quot; but &quot;their priority is to maximize profits. And that&apos;s not always going to be good for communities or businesses or workers.&quot;

As president, Obama added, &quot;Your job is not simply to maximize profits. Your job is to figure out how everybody in the country has a fair shot.&quot;

            <title>Shakil Afridi Helped U.S. Get Osama—So Why Is He In Prison?   5.25.12</title>
            <description>Allies: The name Shakil Afridi may not mean anything to you, but it should. He&apos;s the Pakistani who bravely helped the U.S. track down Osama bin Laden. For his pains, he just got 33 years in a Pakistani prison.

Afridi, a Pakistani physician, believed enough in the U.S. mission and in bringing the world&apos;s most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden, to justice that he helped the CIA find the reclusive terrorist. He should be rewarded — not punished.

Yet, a Pakistani court sentenced him to 33 years in prison for &quot;treason&quot; and, adding insult to injury, a fine of about $3,500.

Of course, we&apos;re told the court that found him guilty is actually a &quot;tribal&quot; court, applying highly idiosyncratic law that is both local and tribal. Had it been a Pakistani government court, he might well have been executed for the crime of treason.

That&apos;s small comfort, since he&apos;ll serve his term in Peshawar Central Jail — a vile, corrupt hellhole in which he&apos;ll be a target for both the Taliban and al-Qaida. Afridi&apos;s chances of serving out his term alive are virtually nil.

What&apos;s especially upsetting about this is that Pakistan is nominally an ally with the U.S. We say nominally because it in fact acts routinely to undercut U.S. interests, and to aid the Taliban and other radical fundamentalist Islamist groups in the region. Some ally.

Just a week ago, Pakistan refused to open up crucial supply routes it controls into Afghanistan&apos;s frontier tribal regions, thereby making the U.S. job of resupplying its troops more perilous — and perhaps even deadly.

It&apos;s hard to believe Pakistan&apos;s government couldn&apos;t intervene on behalf of Afridi if it wanted to. This is its way of getting back at the U.S. for killing bin Laden without seeking either Pakistan&apos;s permission or help.

Afridi, a Pakistani physician, believed enough in the U.S. mission and in bringing the world&apos;s most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden, to justice that he helped the CIA find the reclusive terrorist. He should be rewarded — not punished.

Yet, a Pakistani court sentenced him to 33 years in prison for &quot;treason&quot; and, adding insult to injury, a fine of about $3,500.

Of course, we&apos;re told the court that found him guilty is actually a &quot;tribal&quot; court, applying highly idiosyncratic law that is both local and tribal. Had it been a Pakistani government court, he might well have been executed for the crime of treason.

That&apos;s small comfort, since he&apos;ll serve his term in Peshawar Central Jail — a vile, corrupt hellhole in which he&apos;ll be a target for both the Taliban and al-Qaida. Afridi&apos;s chances of serving out his term alive are virtually nil.

What&apos;s especially upsetting about this is that Pakistan is nominally an ally with the U.S. We say nominally because it in fact acts routinely to undercut U.S. interests, and to aid the Taliban and other radical fundamentalist Islamist groups in the region. Some ally.

Just a week ago, Pakistan refused to open up crucial supply routes it controls into Afghanistan&apos;s frontier tribal regions, thereby making the U.S. job of resupplying its troops more perilous — and perhaps even deadly.

It&apos;s hard to believe Pakistan&apos;s government couldn&apos;t intervene on behalf of Afridi if it wanted to. This is its way of getting back at the U.S. for killing bin Laden without seeking either Pakistan&apos;s permission or help.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama Is a Spendthrift— And Here&apos;s the Proof    5.24.12</title>
            <description>Budget: You wouldn&apos;t think that, after adding $5 trillion to the U.S.&apos; debt, President Obama would seriously claim he&apos;s a fiscal hawk. But thanks to a misleading article on CBS&apos; MarketWatch site, that&apos;s just what he&apos;s doing.

&apos;Since I&apos;ve been president, federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years,&quot; Obama said on Wednesday. &quot;Think about that.&quot;

Obama didn&apos;t turn to his own Office of Management and Budget to support this fact, or even the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.

Instead, he went to a CBS MarketWatch column by Rex Nutting, which claims spending under Obama has risen by an average of just 1.4%.

&quot;Federal spending,&quot; he wrote, &quot;is rising at the slowest pace since Dwight Eisenhower brought the Korean War to an end in the 1950s.&quot;

Nutting even posted a chart to &quot;prove&quot; his case, which appears to show average annual spending hikes under Obama coming in well under that of his predecessors.

Not surprisingly, this &quot;fact&quot; lit up the left-wing blogosphere, with the White House quickly parading the article to dismiss GOP attacks.

There&apos;s just one problem. Nutting had it wrong.

            <title>China Tries To Make Australia An Offer It Can&apos;t Refuse    5.24.12</title>
            <description>The Far East: If there were ever any doubts about China&apos;s aggressive military intentions in the Pacific, its warning to Australia last week to choose itself a U.S. or Chinese &quot;godfather&quot; ought to remove all of them.

In what can only be construed as a direct threat to a top U.S. ally, Song Xiaojun, a &quot;retired&quot; Chinese general, told the Sydney Morning Herald that &quot;Australia has to find a godfather sooner or later.&quot;

&quot;Australia always has to depend on somebody else, whether it is to be the &apos;son&apos; of the U.S. or &apos;son&apos; of China,&quot; Song said, adding that Australia had best choose China because it all &quot;depends on who is more powerful and based on the strategic environment.&quot;

The Chinese statement — which implied Australia is so weak it can&apos;t make its own decisions — is false, arrogant and insulting. But above all, it&apos;s an effort to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Australia. And it isn&apos;t the first time.

Just as Song was implying that China&apos;s trading relationship with Australia would now be used as leverage, China&apos;s foreign minister told Australia&apos;s foreign minister in Beijing that &quot;the time for Cold War alliances has ended.&quot;

At the heart of this crude threat is China&apos;s fury over the 61-year-old U.S.-Australia alliance and a renewed U.S. effort to focus its naval strength on the Asia-Pacific region to counter a Chinese military buildup that is unsettling the nations of the Pacific Rim.

Two weeks ago, 200 U.S. Marines, the first of a &quot;Fox Company&quot; contingent numbering 2,500, arrived for stationing in Darwin, Australia. U.S. military officials say it&apos;s part of a new forward operating base to ensure peace, help out in natural disasters and keep sea lanes open.

China has complained about this, and in recent days made harsh criticisms of the Pentagon&apos;s May 18 annual report on &quot;Military and Security Developments Involving the People&apos;s Republic Of China&quot; as an &quot;obstacle&quot; to good relations with China.

            <title>Scooter Obama Outs Navy SEAL Team 6 Leader For Movie   5.24.12</title>
            <description>National Security: New documents obtained by a watchdog group show our commander in chief gave the name of a Navy Seal Team 6 commander to the makers of a movie about Osama bin Laden. Valerie Plame, call your office.

Those documents, recently obtained by Judicial Watch, reveal that the Obama administration not only spiked the football and did an end-zone dance after the Navy SEALs dispatched bin Laden from his Club Pakistan abode, but was also willing to expose to the other side our playbook and the name of a SEAL commander.

&quot;These documents, which took nine months and a federal lawsuit to disgorge from the Obama administration, show that politically connected filmmakers were given extraordinary and secret access to bin Laden raid information, including the identity of a SEAL Team 6 leader,&quot; said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

&quot;It is both ironic and hypocritical,&quot; Fitton noted, &quot;that the Obama administration stonewalled Judicial Watch&apos;s pursuit of the bin Laden death photos, citing national security concerns, yet seemed willing to share intimate details regarding the raid to help Hollywood filmmakers release a movie &apos;perfectly timed to give a home-stretch boost&apos; (as described by New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd) to the Obama campaign.&quot;

It was a Dowd column that told us of a Sony-produced movie about the raid being put together by the same pair that brought us the Oscar-winning &quot;The Hurt Locker&quot; — screenwriter Mark Boal and director Kathryn Bigelow.

Disclosing the name of a Navy SEAL Team 6 commander to them under any circumstances and offering his services as a consultant is unconscionable.

            <title>Let The Voters Decide On How To Close The Deficit   5.23.12</title>
            <description>Fiscal Cliff: Huge tax hikes and the threat of recession loom next year, says the Congressional Budget Office. So what should Congress do? For now, just enough to avert disaster, and no more.

For some time now, we&apos;ve been hearing dire warnings about the perfect fiscal storm due to hit at the end of this year. The latest, issued this week, comes from the CBO and warns of a potential recession if Congress doesn&apos;t pull the country back from the so-called &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; of spending cuts and massive tax increases due to take effect in January.

If Congress does nothing, says the CBO, the economy would shrink at a 1.3% rate in the first half of 2013. That would probably qualify as a &quot;mild&quot; recession. But any setback would be painful. Joblessness would surely rise off an already high base, and few would escape the pain.

The tax hikes alone would hurt, even for those working. It&apos;s a fact — though obscured by Democratic Party rhetoric — that most of the benefit from the Bush-era tax cuts and all the benefit from the more recent payroll tax cut went to lower- and middle-income Americans.

The rich also would pay more if the tax cuts expire. But that&apos;s just a sop to class envy. It doesn&apos;t put money in middle-class Americans&apos; pockets, and it certainly doesn&apos;t help them find jobs.

            <title>It&apos;s Time To End The Job-Killing U.S. Sugar Policy     5.23.12</title>
            <description>Sugar Subsidies: Bitter about paying artificially high prices for the non-artificial sweetener everyone uses just so a politically connected family can enjoy the sweet life? It&apos;s time lawmakers put a lid on the honey pot.

An Iowa State University study has found that the federal sugar program costs U.S. consumers roughly $3.5 billion a year and deprives the workforce of 20,000 jobs. This New Deal-era framework of barriers on sugar imports and of price supports for domestic sugar is a racket that benefits only a few, in particular the Fanjul family of Florida.

In a letter to House leaders, a group of lawmakers from both parties call U.S. sugar policy &quot;the last of the command-and-control commodity programs that has yet to be reformed.&quot; The 22 representatives insist that Congress should &quot;have a robust debate about sugar policy during consideration of the 2012 farm bill.&quot;

They write: &quot;No other farm program is deliberately designed to transfer income from American consumers and workers to a small, but &apos;special,&apos; interest group of sugar processors and growers.&quot;

The sugar program has led to more job decay than candy has caused cavities. To avoid high prices at home, food manufacturers that use sugar have moved jobs to Canada, where the price of sugar is less than half the U.S. price, and to Mexico, where they&apos;re two-thirds the American rate.

            <title>Will The War On Coal Unplug Obama In November?    5.23.12</title>
            <description>Energy: As coal use drops, job losses rise and electricity prices skyrocket, an electoral map of the 16 top coal-mining states does not bode well for an administration whose energy policy consists of algae and exploding electric cars.

Earlier this year, Houston-based GenOn Energy Inc. announced plans to close five of its older coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania over the next four years, saying that tough new environmental rules make it unprofitable to operate the plants, which generate a total of 3,140 megawatts of electricity.

The plants are in Portland, Shawville, Titus, New Castle and Elrama. Two plants in Ohio and one in New Jersey will also be closed.

Based on current polls, Ohio is once again a battleground state and even Pennsylvania, full of bitter people clinging to their Bibles and guns, may also be in play.

Rising energy prices and lack of jobs will play heavily on the administration&apos;s fortunes in November, both affected by the administration&apos;s war on fossil fuels, particularly coal, being waged via regulations by what has become the fourth branch of government — the Environmental Protection Agency.

The good folks at RedState.com have put together a map showing the top 16 coal-producing states and their place on the electoral stage. Together they contain 182 electoral votes.

            <itunes:summary>Energy: As coal use drops, job losses rise and electricity prices skyrocket, an electoral map of the 16 top coal-mining states does not bode well for an administration whose energy policy consists of algae and exploding electric cars.

Earlier this year, Houston-based GenOn Energy Inc. announced plans to close five of its older coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania over the next four years, saying that tough new environmental rules make it unprofitable to operate the plants, which generate a total of 3,140 megawatts of electricity.

The plants are in Portland, Shawville, Titus, New Castle and Elrama. Two plants in Ohio and one in New Jersey will also be closed.

Based on current polls, Ohio is once again a battleground state and even Pennsylvania, full of bitter people clinging to their Bibles and guns, may also be in play.

Rising energy prices and lack of jobs will play heavily on the administration&apos;s fortunes in November, both affected by the administration&apos;s war on fossil fuels, particularly coal, being waged via regulations by what has become the fourth branch of government — the Environmental Protection Agency.

The good folks at RedState.com have put together a map showing the top 16 coal-producing states and their place on the electoral stage. Together they contain 182 electoral votes.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Left Targets Chief Justice Roberts To Save ObamaCare    5.23.12</title>
            <description>The Judiciary: Controlling the politically insulated federal courts, especially the Supreme Court, has long been atop the left&apos;s to-do list. Since it doesn&apos;t own Chief Justice John Roberts, now the game is to shame him.

The battle over retaining the liberal politicization of the courts, symbolized by Chief Justice Earl Warren&apos;s tenure, goes back at least as far as President Nixon&apos;s failed nominations of Clement Haynsworth and Harrold Carswell in 1969-70; extended to the &quot;borking&quot; of President Reagan&apos;s nomination of Judge Robert Bork in 1987; and ultimately sank to the bottom of the gutter in the character assassination of President George H.W. Bush&apos;s appointee, Justice Clarence Thomas, in 1991.

President Obama took political meddling with the Supreme Court a step further when he stood before some of the justices assembled within the Capitol for his first State of the Union address. From that platform, he referred to the court&apos;s McCain-Feingold ruling, charging that &quot;the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that, I believe, will open the floodgates for special interests.&quot;

Last month, the president contended that if the high court ruled ObamaCare unconstitutional, it would mean &quot;an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law&quot; — which is the Supreme Court&apos;s duty of judicial review that it has &quot;somehow&quot; carried out since Marbury v. Madison in 1803, and which the Warren Court did in landmark liberal cases such as Brown v. Board of Education and Griswold v. Connecticut.

            <title>Catholic Institutions Sue To Restore Religious Freedom   5.22.12</title>
            <description>Freedom Of Religion: Deciding not to go quietly into the secular night of ObamaCare, 43 Catholic institutions have sued for the right to practice what they preach and they thought the Constitution already guaranteed them.

The 43 institutions are situated in 16 jurisdictions from the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., to the University of Notre Dame.

Yes, that Notre Dame, where President Obama in 2009 gave a commencement address in which he called for &quot;open hearts, open minds, fair-minded words&quot; in the pursuit of &quot;common ground.&quot;

Seeing that common ground shifting under their feet, the Catholic institutions have decided to pick up their cross and haul it into court to challenge the ObamaCare mandate that employers provide insurance coverage that includes abortion-inducing drugs, as well as contraceptives and sterilization procedures.

On Monday, Father John Jenkins, president of Notre Dame, was singing from a different hymn book. &quot;This filing,&quot; he said, &quot;is about the freedom of a religious organization to live its mission, and its significance goes well beyond any debate about contraceptives.&quot;

            <title>Better PR Won&apos;t Save ObamaCare   5.22.12</title>
            <description>Health Care: The Obama administration just inked a $20 million deal with PR firm Porter Novelli to help promote ObamaCare. Why do they need to promote a law that was supposed to get more popular once it passed?

According to news accounts, the multimedia campaign is mandated by ObamaCare as a way to educate the public about how to stay healthy and prevent illnesses.

Right. Like another $20 million will make a difference on top of the avalanche of public health news already out there.

A Health and Human Services official let slip the real reason, telling Roll Call that the PR effort is meant &quot;to inform the American people about the many preventive benefits now available ... as a result of the Affordable Care Act.&quot;

In other words, this is more about burnishing ObamaCare&apos;s image before the election than meeting some public health imperative.

Plus, since the law passed, the administration has been relentless in selling it to the public. As the Heritage Foundation notes, HHS pushed Congress to quadruple its public affairs budget. It also spent $1.4 million for an online search ad campaign designed to drive traffic to the ObamaCare website. And it worked extensively with liberal advocacy groups to sell the law.

            <title>America Doesn&apos;t Need NASA To Stay On Top In Space    5.22.12</title>
            <description>Free Enterprise: For those worried that America&apos;s leadership in spaceflight died with NASA&apos;s downsizing, meet SpaceX, a private company that showed Tuesday how capitalism will do what government does and better.

NASA was once the pride of a country fighting a tense Cold War. It planned and executed what is arguably man&apos;s greatest achievement. It indeed engineered a giant leap for mankind.

Yet since those lunar landings, the agency has gotten bogged down in politics and bureaucracy, plagued by waste and ambitions that were never reached. Some believe President Obama&apos;s decision to cut NASA&apos;s budget and the closure of the shuttle program signal the end of manned spaceflight for the U.S. But it doesn&apos;t.

In the pre-dawn hours Tuesday, Space Exploration Technologies Corp. successfully launched its Falcon 9 rocket that was topped with the company&apos;s Dragon capsule. The unmanned Dragon is on course to dock with the International Space Station, where its 674 pounds of food and supplies will be welcomed by the crew on Friday.

On May 31, Dragon will return to Earth loaded with completed science experiments and other gear it will bring back from the space station.

Eventually, SpaceX will put more than hardware and supplies into orbit. It will put men into space.

If there is a demand for any good or service that isn&apos;t being met, the free market will fill the void as long as there is a profit to be earned. Entrepreneurs, such as SpaceX co-founder Elon Musk, won&apos;t let a business opportunity slip away. If there is money to be made, space will be commercialized.

A few years ago, Cato Institute Executive Vice President David Boaz blogged that &quot;there is no shortage of interest in space entrepreneurship: wealthy people with a track record of commercial achievement are yearning to get involved.&quot;

            <title>U.S. Trying To Convert Taliban To Ways Of Freedom    5.22.12</title>
            <description>Defeat: President Obama&apos;s failure to re-open a key Pakistan-to-Afghanistan supply route is symptomatic of overall diplomatic incompetence. The U.S. thinks the Taliban and other jihadists can be converted into good guys.

Charm and brains (supposedly) and a Nobel Peace Prize. Armed with such tools — plus the mightiest military in the history of the world — why can&apos;t President Barack Obama convince piddly little Pakistan to clear the vital land route needed by the U.S. to haul tons of military vehicles from Afghanistan as the Yankees go home, which presumably is what the Muslim world wants?

The route has been closed since November. The reason given is America&apos;s refusal to apologize and pay reparations for U.S. airstrikes that hit two border posts and killed dozens of Pakistani soldiers.

But one could ask why Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, whose wife Benazir Bhutto was assassinated by al-Qaida-affiliated jihadists four-and-a-half years ago, would want to help the U.S. hand neighboring Afghanistan back into the hands of the fanatical Taliban.

Afghanistan watchers know that the country is gazing into an abyss that President Obama has rendered inescapable.

The coded signals of impending catastrophe he used in speaking to the NATO Summit this week include &quot;hard days ahead,&quot; &quot;great challenges ahead&quot; and a &quot;transformational decade.&quot;

            <title>Media Scrutiny On Romney Is Intense, Obama Not So Much    5.22.12</title>
            <description>Bias: Now that the media have fully covered a 150-year old Mormon massacre and Ann Romney&apos;s pet horse, maybe they can start looking into charges the man in the White House may have tried to bribe a critic into silence.

If you&apos;re worried about Mitt Romney being fully vetted, don&apos;t be. The Los Angeles Times is all over it. Just look at Tuesday&apos;s edition. On page one, above the fold, the august West Coast daily ran a weirdly irrelevant story about a lawsuit involving Ann Romney and a horse she once owned.

But that was nothing compared to the Washington Post, which as part of its vetting of candidate Romney — remember, he hasn&apos;t won the nomination yet — investigated a 150-year old Mormon massacre in Arkansas.

Not to be outdone, the New York Times sent reporter Jodi Kantor to sit in on Mitt&apos;s Mormon church to kind of soak up the vibe and see if she could find any dirt.

As far as we can tell, this kind of intense, almost anthropological interest in the Romneys isn&apos;t unusual. Everything about Romney — his prep school hijinks, his career at Bain Capital, his wife&apos;s horse, his car elevator and of course his religion — has been scrutinized. But President Obama, almost finished with his first term, has gotten nothing close to the same attention.

            <description>Growth: At the weekend meeting of G-8 leaders, President Obama exhorted his colleagues in Europe, and especially Germany, to focus on &quot;growth,&quot; not austerity. Is this a joke?

ngjdThe president seems confused. He thinks more government spending, not less, translates to more economic growth.

It&apos;s easy to understand why. Conventionally educated in Keynesian economics, the president, like others on the left, actually believes in things like the government &quot;multiplier&quot; — where a dollar spent by government yields more than a dollar in economic activity.

It doesn&apos;t, of course — as economists from Robert Barro at Harvard to John Taylor at Stanford have shown. Yet, at the G-8 meeting, that&apos;s exactly what Obama told German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the rest of the EU to do: boost growth by spending more.

Merkel must have been perplexed. Germany&apos;s economy is growing, in large part because it ignored the earlier bad advice of those well-meaning economic incompetents who advised it to spend its way to prosperity.

Since the last quarter of 2009, Germany&apos;s average annualized GDP growth has been 2.8%; the U.S. rate, even though it hasn&apos;t had to deal with a second financial crisis as Germany has, has been just 2.4%.

As Germany grows, most of the rest of the EU — especially heavily indebted, big-spending Greece, Spain, and France — are sliding back into recession.

            <title>Occupy Descends Into Bill Ayres-Style Terrorism In Chicago   5.21.12</title>
            <description>Protests: After unleashing a crime wave on U.S. cities, the Occupy movement has descended into actual terrorism, as arrests in Chicago show. This is no longer the work of a fringe, but a shadowy group with political sponsorship.

Three men at the heart of the Occupy movement in Miami were charged Friday with conspiracy to commit terrorism near the NATO summit in Chicago. Mixing up Molotov cocktails, their big plan was to hurl firebombs at Mayor Rahm Emanuel&apos;s home, President Barack Obama&apos;s Chicago campaign headquarters, a police station and various Chicago banks.

&quot;Ever see a cop on fire?&quot; one of the punks asked shortly before he was arrested. After news of that broke, Occupy Chicago took to Twitter to defend the three, calling the arrests state intimidation of &quot;activists.&quot;

It wasn&apos;t the only incident in Chicago: Two other terrorist-wannabes were busted for plotting to make pipe bombs to hurl at the NATO summit.

They may have all been amateurs, but it follows another incident in Cleveland just weeks ago. Three Occupy terrorist-wannabes were caught trying to detonate a bomb on a city bridge. At their arraignment, Occupy protestors showed up in large numbers to support them.

            <title>Cory Booker And The Bain Of Obama&apos;s Existence   5.21.12</title>
            <description>Campaign 2012: Newark&apos;s mayor succumbs to administration thought control after going off-script and praising the private-equity firm that succeeded in creating net jobs, unlike presidential investment Solyndra.

The White House must have had a bad case of the vapors when Newark Mayor Cory Booker, viewed in some quarters as a practical, non-ideological problem-solver, praised the record of Mitt Romney&apos;s former private firm Bain Capital, before a national audience on NBC&apos;s &quot;Meet The Press,&quot; and eschewed attacks of a type he found &quot;nauseating.&quot;

&quot;I have to just say from a very personal level, I&apos;m not about to sit here and indict private equity,&quot; Booker said, referring to an Obama campaign ad that spotlighted the story of a Kansas City steel company that went bankrupt after Bain&apos;s involvement.

The attack ad blamed Romney and his investment firm for the failure of GST Steel, a Kansas City, Mo.-based company, two years after Romney had left Bain. It also ignored Bain successes such as Steel Dynamics Inc., where Bain&apos;s involvement helped create 6,000 jobs.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Bio Grows Even Sketchier   5.21.12</title>
            <description>The Obama Record: The discovery of the president&apos;s false book bio claiming Kenyan birth fits an increasingly disturbing pattern. We&apos;ve long described Obama as radical, but he&apos;s also deceitful.

The mix of these two traits in the Oval Office is toxic. But the Washington media are anything but alarmed, still believing as they do the mythical savior figure they created in 2008.

The other night, MSNBC&apos;s Chris Matthews argued on his &quot;Hardball&quot; show that Americans would be wise to re-elect Obama because he&apos;s &quot;the candidate we know.&quot; He claimed he&apos;s a trusted brand who &quot;is who he seems to be.&quot;

He went on to describe the president as &quot;a fairly pragmatic progressive&quot; and &quot;tough defender of the country.&quot; Therefore, he argued, he&apos;s the safer choice vs. GOP foe Mitt Romney, whom Matthews warns is an unknown commodity — &quot;Brand X&quot; — who could turn out to be a nutty puppet of the &quot;radical right.&quot;

Of course, Obama isn&apos;t at all who he seems to be. And judging from Obama&apos;s sinking poll numbers, this is becoming more apparent to the electorate — thanks in part to the new media&apos;s revetting of Obama after the old media&apos;s half-hearted attempt in 2008.

Voters who don&apos;t watch MSNBC are starting to see that the president&apos;s public persona is merely a hologram created by media shills like Matthews, who define his identity and ideology and redefine it when facts disrupt the carefully constructed narrative.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Anti-Lobbyist Promise Was Easy To Make, Easy To Break   5.21.12</title>
            <description>Ethics: Like so much of the supposed promise of the Obama presidency, the pledge that Washington lobbyists would get a cold shoulder was couched in highfalutin rhetoric. This is one broken promise that resonates.

The dominant media&apos;s habit of covering up for President Obama is infamous. There are the commander-in-chief gaffes (&quot;president of Canada,&quot; &quot;I&apos;ve now been in 57 states,&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t know what the term is in Austrian,&quot; etc.); his close association over many years with a bitterly anti-American and racist preacher; his exploitation of legislative trickery to force government health care on the nation; and the shameless stealing of credit for the killing of Osama bin Laden from the troops &quot;out there fighting on my behalf.&quot;

Yet when it comes to ignoring matters directly related to ethics and corruption, it is then that the president&apos;s media lackeys truly threaten our system of representative government. When Obama this year explicitly broke his pledge that he would not reap the benefits of super-PACs, the White House press corps should have been aggravating him at every turn. But it didn&apos;t.

            <title>Democrats&apos; &apos;Facebook Envy&apos; Tax Hike On Success    5.18.12</title>
            <description>Success: Facebook’s cultural ascent is a tribute to American innovation and entrepreneurship. But powerful Democrats see its financial success as a chance to fuel popular envy and line the pockets of big government.

Barack Obama and Congress&apos; leading Democrats say Mitt Romney doesn&apos;t get it when it comes to the economy.

But the politicized soap opera surrounding Facebook&apos;s stock exchange debut last week verifies that it&apos;s actually Romney&apos;s accusers who don&apos;t get it.

Whatever the overhype or trading problems Facebook&apos;s $16 billion IPO experienced on Friday, there can be no denying the mobility-geared social network is one of the great success stories in business history.

And as with that unknown teenage pre-med major in the early 1980s named Michael Dell taking apart Apple IIs in his Austin, Texas dorm room, no central planner doling out &quot;investment&quot; money could have found Mark Zuckerberg and his Beantown college roommates in 2003 and realized the website they were designing was the future of popular computing.

Those who did risk their money on Zuckerberg&apos;s idea — to the benefit of 900 million people on Facebook — will now be numbered among the evil 1%, as they rake in their just financial rewards. Facebook millionaires will ultimately number in the thousands.

            <title>Jig&apos;s Up, Cherokee Liz    5.18.12</title>
            <description>Preferences: There&apos;s no truth whatever to Democratic Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren&apos;s claim to Indian ancestry. She&apos;s been proved a fraud. Time for her to fess up and end this charade.

All the evidence she&apos;s offered to justify listing herself as a minority on law school directories the last 25 years has been shot down. The Harvard law professor&apos;s claims just don&apos;t stand up to scrutiny.

The New England Historical Genealogical Society this week reversed its claim it had proof of Warren&apos;s alleged Cherokee heritage. That proof was hearsay Warren fed the society, and in turn, the Boston Globe.

She cited the word &quot;Cherokee&quot; scrawled on a distant relative&apos;s 1894 Oklahoma marriage license.

But Breitbart.com dug the records up and found no such thing. Digging further, the news site found quite the opposite: Warren&apos;s great-great-great-grandfather rounded up Cherokees and herded them along the infamous &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; into Army stockades.

Shamed, the Globe had to run a correction.

Unless Warren can offer proof, she should quit her post at Harvard Law, which has touted her as its &quot;first woman of color.&quot; She plainly wasn&apos;t hired on merit.

But since taking office, Obama&apos;s policies have made everything far worse.

But Breitbart.com dug the records up and found no such thing. Digging further, the news site found quite the opposite: Warren&apos;s great-great-great-grandfather rounded up Cherokees and herded them along the infamous &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; into Army stockades.

Shamed, the Globe had to run a correction.

Unless Warren can offer proof, she should quit her post at Harvard Law, which has touted her as its &quot;first woman of color.&quot; She plainly wasn&apos;t hired on merit.

But since taking office, Obama&apos;s policies have made everything far worse.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Look What Obama&apos;s Bragging About Now    5.18.12</title>
            <description>Budget: President Obama boasts on Twitter that spending, taxes and deficits are all below where they were when he took office. The truth is, he inherited a bad situation and made it worse.

Think Progress, the George Soros-funded left-wing advocacy group that&apos;s always ready and willing to lend Obama a hand, has put together a chart that, it claims, proves that the president has been a good fiscal steward.

Federal spending, it says, &quot;is lower now than it was when President Obama took office.&quot;

Not only that, but &quot;taxes today are lower than they were on Inauguration Day 2009.&quot;

And as icing on the cake: &quot;The deficit this year is going to be lower than what it was on the day President Obama took office.&quot;

The group came to this conclusion by comparing the Congressional Budget Office&apos;s forecast for fiscal 2009 — made just before Obama was sworn in — to the one it just released for fiscal 2012.

Trouble is, the picture Think Progress paints is completely misleading.

It&apos;s true that Obama inherited a bad economy, but it was starting to bottom out just as he was sworn into office. That recession, as all do, boosted federal spending, cut federal tax revenues and swelled the deficit.

            <title>Billions For Climate, Not One More Cent For Defense    5.18.12</title>
            <description>Federal Priorities: A new report shows we have spent $70 billion on climate change since 2008 while our strapped military is ordered to become energy-efficient. Imagine weapons that don&apos;t harm the environment.

Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, took to the Senate floor Thursday to decry the green agenda being imposed on the military by the Obama administration at the same time the defense budget is being sacrificed on the altar of runaway deficit spending.

Inhofe produced a Congressional Research Service report that showed that from fiscal years 2008 through 2012 the federal government spent $68.4 billion to combat climate change. During that time the Defense Department spent nearly $4 billion on energy efficiency and climate change activities.

We wonder if the environment is the uppermost thing on the minds of soldiers being shot at by the Taliban and avoiding being blown up by IEDs. But it does seem to be on the mind of Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.

&quot;The area of climate change,&quot; he recently told the Environmental Defense Fund, &quot;has a dramatic impact on national security.&quot;

            <title>Chinese Solar Cells And The Solyndra Syndrome   5.18.12</title>
            <description>Tariffs: It seems the Obama administration will do anything to save a handful of U.S. jobs in the manufacture of solar cells — even to the point of risking a job-killing trade war.

Thursday&apos;s announcement by the Commerce Department of new duties on imported solar cells from China was good news for almost nobody. China was miffed, naturally. Much of the U.S. solar energy business was less than joyful as well.

Even in solar manufacturing, reaction was mixed. Makers of solar cells are pleased; makers of raw materials and production equipment exported to China were not. And for anyone in the business of selling and installing solar systems — where most of the jobs are — the tariffs are bad news. They raise prices for a product that already has to be heavily subsidized to find a market.

Companies that make solar cells in the U.S., led by the German firm SolarWorld (which makes the cells at a plant in Oregon), had complained to the administration that China was selling cells abroad at an unfairly low price.

The Commerce Department gave them what they wanted on Thursday when it said it would slap a 31% tariff on solar cells from 61 named Chinese manufacturers, along with a 250% levy on cells from all others in China. This was on top of import duties of up to 4.73% imposed in March.

If the tariffs stand (they&apos;re subject to final review later this year), they&apos;ll cost jobs, maybe far more than they save. They&apos;ll be especially harmful if China reacts in kind.

We know, we know — there is such a thing as dumping. It violates trade agreements and free-market principles, and it&apos;s wrong. China is accused of selling photovoltaic cells abroad at less than its cost of producing them, which of course it could not do without a government subsidy.

            <title>IBD/TIPP Poll: Obama Failing As &apos;Great Distracter&apos;    5.17.12</title>
            <description>IBD/TIPP Poll: &quot;The Great Distracter&quot; has failed to distract from his failures as his support among women and independents falls. And it will only get harder to make voters forget the weak economy.

The latest IBD/TIPP survey, which polled 778 registered voters over the eight days ended Wednesday, found that while same-sex marriage is viewed positively by many independents, President Obama&apos;s support among that key voting bloc has fallen since his switcheroo on such unions.

On top of that, his support among women has suffered — at a time when Democrats are conducting a coordinated effort accusing likely GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney of waging a &quot;war on women.&quot;

The president&apos;s attempts to distract voters from the nation&apos;s economic woes are apparently failing. The dismal reality of 8%-plus unemployment — four years after the 2008 financial crisis — remains at the front of their minds.

Obama still leads overall in the IBD/TIPP results, 43% to 40%, but that&apos;s a drop from the at-least 46% support in our previous polls this year.

Among independents, Romney now leads Obama 39% to 35%, with 17% unsure.

            <title>Wikileaks Is A Weapon In The Bloody Hands Of Iran  5.17.12</title>
            <description>WikiLeaks: The sleazy criminal organization dedicated to publishing U.S. secrets may loudly deny its leaks led to the hanging of a man in Iran Tuesday. But that&apos;s irrelevant because WikiLeaks gave Tehran the pretext it sought.

A 24-year old Iranian man was the latest victim of the mullahs&apos; monstrous tyranny this week, executed as a spy for Israel, supposedly for killing an Iranian nuclear scientist on behalf of his Zionist masters. That&apos;s a whiff of the twisted kangaroo court verdicts typical of Iran.

In reality, Majid Jamali Fashi was a young kick-boxing instructor who visited Baku, Azerbaijan, for a tournament in August 2009. That was a month before a U.S. Embassy cable went out describing a meeting with an Iranian &quot;coach and trainer&quot; who told embassy officials about how Iran was pressuring athletes to join its government goon squads.

WikiLeaks turned that into a death warrant by illegally leaking the mundane cable in late 2010 just as the crazed mullahs, under pressure for the mysterious killings of its nuclear scientists, wanted to arrest someone.

As novelist Richard Grenier once wrote: They put two and two together and came up with 22.

It was easy for Tehran to do, because WikiLeaks blacked out the Iranian&apos;s name from the stolen U.S. document. That let Iran put any old name it liked in its place and construct the pretext it wanted to accuse a likely innocent man of murder and execute him.

            <title>Obama Lies About Reagan Endorsing Buffett Rule   5.17.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: The president&apos;s narcissistic self-insertion into official presidential biographies would have us believe the Great Communicator would agree with the Great Teleprompter Reader on taxes. Well, there he goes again.

Not willing to wait until his visage is enshrined next to actor and donor George Clooney on Mt. Rushmore, President Obama&apos;s helpers have notoriously inserted their fearless leader into the official White House biographies of virtually every former president back to Calvin Coolidge, except for Gerald Ford.

The White House defended the practice of appending presidential biographies by saying it is common Web practice to provide links to ease navigation and increase traffic. What we have here is an Orwellian rewriting of history akin to the fictional Winston Smith doing it on a daily basis for the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell&apos;s novel &quot;1984.&quot;

Inserted into the official bio of the late President Ronald Reagan was this lie: &quot;In a June 28, 1985, speech, Reagan called for a fairer tax code, one where a multimillionaire did not have a lower tax rate than his secretary. Today, President Obama is calling for the same with the Buffett Rule.&quot;

            <title>Obama&apos;s Wages An Unending War On American Capitalism   5.17.12</title>
            <description>The Obama Record: The president has made Mitt Romney&apos;s Bain Capital a target of his re-election campaign. That&apos;s one way to divert attention from poor performance. It&apos;s also a way to undermine capitalism.

At a New York fundraiser Monday night, Obama called the free market &quot;the greatest wealth generator ever devised by man.&quot; Those are fine words for a campaign stop among the moneyed set. But those words aren&apos;t backed by the actions of a president who only months ago claimed the free market &quot;has never worked.&quot;

The same day Obama flopped back to his &quot;capitalism is good&quot; position, his team set out to taint Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney co-founded and ran as CEO.

            <itunes:summary>The Obama Record: The president has made Mitt Romney&apos;s Bain Capital a target of his re-election campaign. That&apos;s one way to divert attention from poor performance. It&apos;s also a way to undermine capitalism.

At a New York fundraiser Monday night, Obama called the free market &quot;the greatest wealth generator ever devised by man.&quot; Those are fine words for a campaign stop among the moneyed set. But those words aren&apos;t backed by the actions of a president who only months ago claimed the free market &quot;has never worked.&quot;

The same day Obama flopped back to his &quot;capitalism is good&quot; position, his team set out to taint Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney co-founded and ran as CEO.

In a campaign video, Romney is described as a &quot;vampire&quot; and &quot;job destroyer.&quot; The Obama camp charges him with taking profits &quot;at great cost to American workers and their communities.&quot;

That&apos;s the work of the real Obama, who&apos;s just another of those malcontents who has become a success, thanks to capitalism yet rants regularly about its evils.

            <title>First Shoe Drops: Catholic School Drops ObamaCare   5.16.12</title>
            <description>Health Reform: Faced with being forced to abandon its conscience while emptying its bank account, a Catholic university finds its students can&apos;t keep the health insurance they like as it becomes prohibitively expensive.

Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio, finding itself at the nexus of cost and conscience regarding the demands and expenses imposed on it and other Catholic institutions by the onslaught of ObamaCare, has announced it will neither comply nor participate in the nationalization of health care and drop the health coverage it offers to its students.

It&apos;s the first shoe to drop in what will be a cascade of such decisions. Franciscan University was able to drop its coverage, but as the U.S. Council of Catholic Bishops has warned, other institutions and charities may be forced to close, sell off their assets or turn them over to secular operators in the wake of ObamaCare&apos;s unacceptable mandates and costs.

&quot;This is putting people in a position where they are having to choose between their faith and their morality — and now an unjust cost,&quot; said Mike Hernon, vice president of advancement at the university. &quot;These sorts of regulations from the government are forcing our hand in a way that&apos;s really wrong.&quot;

Hernon said students must have insurance — either through their parents&apos; policy or through the university&apos;s basic plan. That plan now costs about $600 a year. However, Hernon said the school&apos;s health care provider has served notice that under ObamaCare, the policy would double to $1,200 and then triple the year after.

            <title>War On Banks Spreads To City Hall    5.16.12</title>
            <description>Regulation: A leftist movement to pass local &quot;responsible banking ordinances&quot; is sweeping the nation. Now banks will be harassed into making risky loans by city, not just federal, diversity cops.

The two largest cities this week approved laws requiring banks doing business with them to meet race-based quotas for mortgage and small-business lending. They&apos;ll also have to stop foreclosures on previous bad loans and vow to open new branches in urban neighborhoods.

New York and Los Angeles officials who voted for the laws say they&apos;re trying to &quot;build on the Community Reinvestment Act.&quot; This is the same federal banking regulation that fed the subprime bubble by requiring banks to make riskier mortgages in &quot;underserved communities.&quot;

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a strong President Obama ally who agrees the CRA&apos;s power and scope should be expanded, is expected to sign the ordinance. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is likely to veto it, though the city council will be able to override it.

The moves effectively turn local authorities into bank regulators along with the federal government, adding another layer of CRA enforcement and creating additional pressure on banks to make risky loans.

They also create an unnecessary paperwork burden for banks in these large markets. Bank officials now have to regularly report lending data to city contracting agencies, in addition to federal bank regulators (who already post CRA ratings for any city official to see).

This added compliance cost ultimately will be passed on to bank customers. And taxpayers will have to pick up the cost of the new city bureaucracies that will be set up to police bank lending practices.

Still, New York and Los Angeles are joined by several other major cities in passing such social banking laws, including Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Cleveland. In addition, San Diego, Oakland, Seattle, Boston, Austin, Philadelphia and Portland have drafted similar laws.

            <title>Obama Won&apos;t Tell You About Impending Taxes And Cuts   5.15.12</title>
            <description>Budget: Congressional Democrats plan massive tax increases and crippling defense cuts after November. Why not now? Because the voters would realize the Obama presidency has set the stage for fiscal catastrophe.

&apos;The way to deal with sequestration is put revenues on the table.&quot; That is third-ranking Senate Democrat Charles Schumer of New York&apos;s coded way of telling congressional Republicans that if you want to prevent the budgetary devastation of the U.S. military, you&apos;ll have to break your promises to voters and agree to major tax hikes.

After the presidential and congressional elections this November, a lame-duck Congress will address an impending fiscal calamity.

Without action, the Bush tax cuts once again are set to expire at the end of the year and some $110 billion in indiscriminate, across-the-board spending cuts will take place automatically. House Speaker John Boehner is already wisely demanding &quot;cuts and reforms greater than&quot; any debt limit increase.

Heritage Foundation senior fellow and former Treasury Department tax economist J.D. Foster recently warned that on New Year&apos;s Day, &quot;some $494 billion in tax hikes will crash down on America&apos;s taxpayers and economy&quot; — not just the expiration of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that gave us a boom and cut unemployment to under 5%, but &quot;a jump in the payroll tax rate,&quot; &quot;the return of the death tax,&quot; &quot; a bigger, badder&quot; Alternative Minimum Tax, and the tax hikes for ObamaCare.

            <title>Hurry Up And Spend? No, Slow Down And Think    5.15.12</title>
            <description>High-Speed Rail: It says something that even struggling California may be willing to lose a $3.3 billion federal bullet-train grant. Maybe it senses some risk. Now how can that be?

The Golden State is not known for its fiscal sobriety, but at least some of its top lawmakers are thinking twice about accepting the Obama administration&apos;s invitation to waste money.

Last week, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said a promised $3.3 billion federal grant to start the state&apos;s high-speed rail system is at risk unless the state budgets $2.7 billion from bond funds for it this June.

State Senate leaders, bucking Gov. Jerry Brown as well as LaHood, want to put off a decision until August. LaHood said that&apos;s &quot;too late for us.&quot;

On the contrary, even August is too soon for the state to jump into rail construction.

Never would be better. But the stalling is a good sign, as is the apparent willingness to give up the federal grant rather than be rushed into a rash decision.

It seems the state&apos;s legislative leaders, if not its governor, see trouble ahead. The federal money may be enough to start the work, but it doesn&apos;t ensure a project&apos;s success or solvency. On the contrary, it can be a ticket to fiscal disaster.

            <title>America To Reap Big On Jobs With The Colombia Free Trade Pact    5.15.12</title>
            <description>Trade: Six years after it was signed, the U.S.-Colombia free-trade agreement took effect Tuesday, giving our economy a shot in the arm. Tell us again why this pact was a bad thing?

Look at the Port of Long Beach. Monday, port officials drove the first golden pile into the water for their $1.2 billion upgrade and expansion, hailing a modernization that will double the port&apos;s traffic when completed in 2019.

The project restores the California port as the U.S.&apos; biggest, and competitively answers the Panama Canal&apos;s $5.25 billion expansion.

Increased trade capacity makes that possible — and nothing turbocharges trade more than free trade treaties.

With the U.S.-Colombia free trade pact going into force Tuesday, the U.S. stands to gain $1.1 billion in new sales to Colombia, meaning plenty of demand for Long Beach. In anticipation, U.S. trade with Colombia increased 19% last year alone.

And ports like Charleston, Miami, Houston and New Orleans may reap even bigger benefits. That means jobs — lots of them.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Economic Winter: Can Adam And Steve Find Jobs?   5.15.12</title>
            <description>Job Creation: With just 7% of Americans considering gay marriage the top issue, the presumptive GOP nominee asks: What about the 23 million Americans who are out of work, underemployed or have simply given up?

The battle of the steel ads between venture capitalist Mitt Romney and venture socialist and incumbent President Barack Obama has ended with the advantage going to Romney.

The Obama spot dubbed &quot;Steel,&quot; but which perhaps could have been labeled &quot;Vampire,&quot; will be run once during the evening news on Wednesday in five key battleground states and then be withdrawn while people stop laughing.

Such ads depend on talking-head analysis to get the word out rather than the actual ad buy, and for Team Obama the reviews have not been good.

The attack ad blaming Romney and his investment firm Bain Capital for the failure of GST Steel, a Kansas City, Mo.-based company, fell flat after it became known Romney left Bain two years before the company failed in 2001.

That was also a time when 17 other steel companies that Bain had nothing to do with failed as prices imploded from the dumping of foreign steel in the U.S. market.

The 750 jobs lost at GST are fewer than the 1,100 employees who lost their jobs at Solyndra, the stimulus-backed manufacturer of solar panels, and certainly fewer than the job losses at the &quot;bailed out&quot; Government Motors, its suppliers and the workers at the closed GM dealerships.

The Obama spot dubbed &quot;Steel,&quot; but which perhaps could have been labeled &quot;Vampire,&quot; will be run once during the evening news on Wednesday in five key battleground states and then be withdrawn while people stop laughing.

Such ads depend on talking-head analysis to get the word out rather than the actual ad buy, and for Team Obama the reviews have not been good.

The attack ad blaming Romney and his investment firm Bain Capital for the failure of GST Steel, a Kansas City, Mo.-based company, fell flat after it became known Romney left Bain two years before the company failed in 2001.

That was also a time when 17 other steel companies that Bain had nothing to do with failed as prices imploded from the dumping of foreign steel in the U.S. market.

The 750 jobs lost at GST are fewer than the 1,100 employees who lost their jobs at Solyndra, the stimulus-backed manufacturer of solar panels, and certainly fewer than the job losses at the &quot;bailed out&quot; Government Motors, its suppliers and the workers at the closed GM dealerships.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Blood Of Housing Massacre On Obama&apos;s Hands     5.15.12</title>
            <description>Subprime Scandal: Analysts now say the housing market is so weak it may not rebound in our lifetimes. Yet the White House is pursuing the same policies that put it on its back.

Worse, many of the officials it has put in charge of reviving the housing market are the same ones who crafted the fatal policies before the crisis. First, consider the latest data supporting a lost generation in housing:

• The average homeowner today has 7% equity in his home vs. 45% in 1990.

• Home prices in 20 major markets plunged 3.5% from a year earlier; adjusted for inflation, they&apos;re back to 1998 levels.

• The U.S. homeownership rate fell to a 16-year low of 65.4% in the first quarter.

• Homeownership for blacks, now at 43.1%, is the worst since 1995, when the government first launched its reckless housing policies in a national campaign to boost minority homeownership.

It was then, roughly a decade before the mortgage meltdown, that the Clinton administration declared traditional underwriting standards racist.

            <title>Obama Campaign Practices Private Equity Double Standard.   5.15.12</title>
            <description>Hypocrisy: While the president blasts Mitt Romney&apos;s private equity successes, he happily takes private equity campaign cash. If this election becomes &quot;the company fixer&quot; vs. &quot;the economy wrecker,&quot; Obama is in big trouble.

How you made your money is evil, but to get re-elected president I&apos;m happy to take lots of cash others made in the same way.

That, in essence, is Barack Obama&apos;s message in condemning Mitt Romney&apos;s many years of work fixing and saving major employers through private equity financing — while having another private equity maestro deliver carts of booty to Obama&apos;s own campaign.

            <title>Media Rekindle Their Obama Love Affair.   5.15.12</title>
            <description>Media Bias: The Washington Post defends its Mitt Romney hit piece by claiming it didn&apos;t collude with the Obama White House on timing. Collusion isn&apos;t the problem. The fact that they both share the same goal is.

Three years ago, former CBS News correspondent Bernie Goldberg wrote the aptly titled book &quot;A Slobbering Love Affair,&quot; in which he detailed how the mainstream press had gone above and beyond its own well-established liberal bias to take on the corrupting role of Obama&apos;s cheerleader, collaborator and protector.

Now having helped land Obama in office, the so-called independent press is determined to keep him there. Which helps explain why the Washington Post — the paper that still vigorously pats itself on the back for &quot;bringing down&quot; President Nixon — has been so willing and eager to bring down President Obama&apos;s opponent.

            <title>California&apos;s &apos;Unexpected&apos; $16 Billion Deficit.   5.15.12</title>
            <description>States: California now forecasts a budget deficit this year of $16 billion, not the $9.2 billion first estimated. The governor calls this &quot;unexpected.&quot; But how can it be unexpected when it happens every year?

Jerry Brown, who as governor in the 1970s began California&apos;s long, sad decline from greatness, seems intent on finishing the job.

&quot;We are still recovering from the worst recession since the 1930s,&quot; the governor formerly known as Moonbeam said in a YouTube video. &quot;Tax receipts are coming lower than expected, and the federal government and the courts have blocked us from making billions of necessary budget reductions. The result is that we are now facing a $16 billion deficit.&quot;

Brown is uncharacteristically modest in not mentioning his own role in California&apos;s continued meltdown. Just like his Democratic pals in the Golden State&apos;s legislature, the nation&apos;s worst, he refuses to accept reality.

            <title>GAO To Obama: More Oil Than Rest Of The World.   5.15.12</title>
            <description>Energy: The Government Accountability Office tells Congress the Green River Formation out West contains an &quot;amount about equal to the entire world&apos;s proven oil reserves.&quot; So why are we keeping it locked up on federal lands?

Exploding the Big Lie pushed by President Obama that we can&apos;t drill our way out of high gas prices because we have but 2% of the world&apos;s proven oil reserves, Anu Mittal, GAO director of natural resources and environment, testified before Congress last week that just one small part of the U.S. is capable of outproducing the rest of the planet.

That small part is known as the Green River Formation, the world&apos;s largest oil shale deposit, and is located in a largely vacant region of mostly federal land on the western edge of the Rocky Mountains that includes portions of Wyoming, Utah and Colorado.

            <description>Economics: The president has been accused of seeking to turn the U.S. into an Americanized Western European welfare state. If he insists on imitating one particular model, we suggest he follow the Swedish paradigm.

Sweden has a reputation as the prototypical cradle-to-grave socialist European nation, and the political left has long yearned for America to be more like the Scandinavian nation.

But it&apos;s looking through a smudged window. With little notice, Sweden has changed.

            <title>JPMorgan Chase Loss Shows Flaws Of Volcker Rule   5.14.12</title>
            <description>Finance: JPMorgan Chase&apos;s surprise $2 billion trading loss brought immediate calls from Washington for still more regulation. But if anything, this shows the costly Dodd-Frank financial regulation has solved nothing.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has been a loud critic of the Dodd-Frank financial law — particularly the Volcker Rule, which limits banks&apos; investments for their own accounts.

So no doubt there was some high-fiving in Washington over his bank&apos;s $2 billion trading loss.

Dimon was blunt in his own assessment, calling his bank&apos;s trading strategy &quot;flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed and poorly monitored.&quot;

&quot;We will admit it, we will fix it and move on,&quot; he added. But that&apos;s not enough for some.

            <title>Austerity Debate Will Give Voters A Clear Choice   5.14.12</title>
            <description>Economy: We can see the wheels turning in Democratic strategists&apos; heads: Brand the GOP as the &quot;austerity&quot; party and watch the public recoil. Just like what happened in France. Well, maybe not.

People get mad when you cut government spending. So don&apos;t cut government spending. Is that what Europe is telling us?

To the Obama administration and its defenders, it&apos;s the lesson they&apos;d prefer to draw. For if the Continent&apos;s recent leftward lurch is a revolt against deficit cutting, the Democratic Party&apos;s failure to rein in spending becomes a political virtue. It&apos;s the Republicans who become the party of &quot;austerity.&quot; Too bad for them.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Views on Distraction Have Evolved, Too   5.14.12</title>
            <description>Election: Remember how candidate Barack Obama complained in 2008 that any discussion not involving the economy was a &quot;distraction&quot;? This time, his entire campaign is built on distracting voters from the economy.

During his 2008 campaign, one of Obama&apos;s favorite words was &quot;distraction.&quot; He constantly plugged it into his speeches and interviews to dismiss any controversy that might have erupted, or an issue he didn&apos;t particularly want to talk about.

Questions about how Obama could have sat in the pews and listened to Rev. Wright&apos;s anti-American, race-baiting screeds for years? Distraction. Questions about his relationship with radical Bill Ayers? Distraction. Questions about his qualifications to be president? Distraction.

            <title>Freeing Taliban Like Freeing Al-Qaida Terrorists   5.14.12</title>
            <description>War On Terror: Declassified bin Laden files reveal a close working relationship between al-Qaida and the Taliban. They&apos;re in effect the same group. So why&apos;s the president freeing Taliban prisoners?

The documents, gathered in the raid on bin Laden&apos;s compound in Pakistan, show he and his then-deputy Ayman Zawahiri discussed joint attacks against U.S. troops in Afghanistan with Taliban chief Mullah Omar.

Zawahiri is still alive today and presumably still helping direct Taliban operations against the U.S. as bin Laden&apos;s heir apparent. He and Omar are said to both be hiding inside Pakistan.

The high-level communications between al-Qaida and the Taliban is deeply problematic.

            <title>Is Ex-Im Bank Another Fannie Mae Or Freddie Mac?   5.11.12</title>
            <description>Politics: In an unusual display of election-year bipartisanship, Democrats and Republicans have joined to renew the charter of the Export-Import Bank. Political triumph? Hardly.

Ninety-three Republicans broke ranks with Speaker John Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy to vote &quot;no&quot; on the renewal of the Ex-Im Bank. It still passed by a 330-93 vote, with 183 Democrats joining 147 Republicans on the &quot;yes&quot; side.

This is no shining example of bipartisanship, as it&apos;s now being hailed. The Ex-Im Bank could justifiably be called the &quot;Political Crony Bank,&quot; because of its use as a piggy bank for politically favored companies.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Gay Marriage Flip Shows How Big Money Sets His Agenda   5.11.12</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: The one thing that can be concluded from President Obama&apos;s sudden &quot;evolving&quot; support for gay marriage ahead of a big Hollywood fundraiser is that money talks. It&apos;s how he governs. Just don&apos;t call it democratic.

Politicians are often rightly criticized for twisting with the winds of polls. Obama is different, and not in a good way. Instead of making decisions based on principle — which might occasionally go against polls — Obama&apos;s decisions are based purely on who donates the most money.

His sudden shift on gay marriage this week proves it.

            <description>Leadership: Lost in his gay marriage flip-flop was the president&apos;s claim that our armed forces fight for him, not their country. It was like following his spiking of the football over the Osama bin Laden kill with an end-zone dance.

Few caught the revealing Freudian slip during President Obama&apos;s interview with Robin Roberts of ABC News in which he said he no longer considered what he described to evangelist Rick Warren in the election year of 2008 as the &quot;sacred union&quot; of marriage to be just between one man and one woman.

But there it was, from the lips of the man who considers the Navy SEALs as stage props in his re-election bid and whose use of the first person pronoun &quot;I&quot; has set some sort of Guinness Book world record.

            <description>Values: The president&apos;s coming out in favor of gay marriage shows he&apos;s to the left of most black Americans — and willing to throw his most loyal backers under the gay pride float.

Under pressure to assuage the gay lobby and young voters ahead of November, Obama on Wednesday told ABC News &quot;it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.&quot;

Under pressure to assuage the gay lobby and young voters ahead of November, Obama on Wednesday told ABC News &quot;it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.&quot;</itunes:summary>

            <description>Tuesday&apos;s Results: The Tea Party shows it&apos;s alive and well, Wisconsin&apos;s embattled governor gets more votes than the top two Democrats and a federal inmate gives the president a primary battle. The natives are still restless.

Conservative pundit and IBD contributor Ann Coulter once said she, like many Americans, would rather vote for Jeffrey Dahmer, known for his unusual culinary choices, over President Obama. Federal prisoner Keith Russell Judd, 49, is not quite in Dahmer&apos;s league, but for a substantial portion of West Virginia Democrats, he is also preferable to our campaigner-in-chief.

            <description>Energy Security: Do America&apos;s enemies wish us well? It&apos;s an important question because they&apos;ve made a big push to halt U.S. energy production. So why does the Obama administration&apos;s policies support their aims?

Energy is the lifeblood of the mighty U.S. economy, and it ought to surprise no one that America&apos;s enemies know this. One way to neutralize the U.S. is to hurt its ability to produce its own energy.

            <title>Bin Laden May Ironically Be Obama&apos;s Albatross   5.8.12</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: The president seems to think bragging about killing Osama bin Laden will help get him re-elected. But the question is increasingly becoming why the president hesitated on such a no-brainer decision.

Jack Keane, the Army vice chief of staff from 1999 to 2003, told Mike Huckabee on Fox News over the weekend that the U.S. government knew exactly where Osama bin Laden was nearly a year before President Obama gave the order to send in the Navy SEALs to his compound in Pakistan.

            <description>Taxes: A new IBD/TIPP poll finds most back President Obama&apos;s soak-the-rich Buffett tax rule. But they also want dividend and capital gains taxes kept low to encourage investment and growth. Problem is, you can&apos;t do both.

The IBD/TIPP survey found that 55% of Americans think investment income should be &quot;taxed at a lower rate than wages.&quot; Even 38% of Democrats believe this. And, not too surprisingly, 65% of investors concur.

            <description>Sovereignty: Even if he&apos;s not re-elected, the president hopes to leave behind a treaty giving a U.N. body veto power over the use of our territorial waters and to which we&apos;d be required to give half of our offshore oil revenue.

The Law Of The Sea Treaty (LOST) has been lurking in the shadows for decades. Like the Kyoto Protocol that pretended to be an effort to save the earth from the poisoned fruit of the Industrial Revolution, LOST pretends to be an effort to protect the world&apos;s oceans from environmental damage and remove it as a cause of potential conflicts between nations.

The Lone Star State is not a favorite of the environmentalists and their political-media allies. But it has long been a rich source of oil that drives our economy.

            <title>Dismal Beginning To Obama&apos;s Never-Ending Campaign   5.7.12</title>
            <description>Politics: The Preezy of the United Steezy, as Barack Obama lets Jimmy Fallon refer to him, opens his re-election bid to a partially-filled stadium and a letter from his rival asking this year&apos;s key question: Where are the jobs?

There were no faux Greek columns when the president with the composite girlfriend and taste for canine filets officially began his 57-state campaign Saturday at Ohio State University&apos;s 18,300-seat Schottenstein Center that was only partially filled with those wearing faded &quot;hope and change&quot; T-shirts hoping to get their student loans paid off.

According to recent stats, only half of OSU graduates can expect to find jobs and like the rest of their brethren will take up residence in their parents&apos; basements between occupy-whatever rallies. The one they were once again waiting for drew some 14,000 people to the arena. Before he spoke, the OSU newspaper, the Lantern, tweeted that ushers were asking people at the rally to move &quot;in order for seats to look full for TV.&quot;

The glass looked less half-empty later at President Obama&apos;s next stop at a rally at the Siegel Center at the University of Virginia in another 2012 battleground state. It seats a more manageable crowd of 8,000. But the message was the same.

&quot;If people ask you what the campaign is all about, hope. It&apos;s still about change,&quot; he told his Virginia audience after nearly four years of work on his golf game. The campaign is about waiting for nothing while an &quot;economy built to last&quot; on electric cars and windmills finally implodes under the weight of his own arrogance.

            <itunes:summary>Politics: The Preezy of the United Steezy, as Barack Obama lets Jimmy Fallon refer to him, opens his re-election bid to a partially-filled stadium and a letter from his rival asking this year&apos;s key question: Where are the jobs?

There were no faux Greek columns when the president with the composite girlfriend and taste for canine filets officially began his 57-state campaign Saturday at Ohio State University&apos;s 18,300-seat Schottenstein Center that was only partially filled with those wearing faded &quot;hope and change&quot; T-shirts hoping to get their student loans paid off.

According to recent stats, only half of OSU graduates can expect to find jobs and like the rest of their brethren will take up residence in their parents&apos; basements between occupy-whatever rallies. The one they were once again waiting for drew some 14,000 people to the arena. Before he spoke, the OSU newspaper, the Lantern, tweeted that ushers were asking people at the rally to move &quot;in order for seats to look full for TV.&quot;

The glass looked less half-empty later at President Obama&apos;s next stop at a rally at the Siegel Center at the University of Virginia in another 2012 battleground state. It seats a more manageable crowd of 8,000. But the message was the same.

&quot;If people ask you what the campaign is all about, hope. It&apos;s still about change,&quot; he told his Virginia audience after nearly four years of work on his golf game. The campaign is about waiting for nothing while an &quot;economy built to last&quot; on electric cars and windmills finally implodes under the weight of his own arrogance.</itunes:summary>

            <title>U.S. Warning To India On Iran Oil Reeks Of Hypocrisy   5.7.12</title>
            <description>Diplomacy: Secretary of State Clinton urged India to buy less oil from Iran or else. It&apos;s a sour note to India. As State stalls the Keystone XL pipeline, the U.S. is buying up more oil than ever from India&apos;s own suppliers.

One wonders what India&apos;s officials must have thought as Hillary Clinton arrived in Delhi with a warning that unless they buy less Iranian oil — now at 550,000 barrels a day, or 9% of its oil imports — they face punishing U.S. sanctions on their banks by June 28.

To be sure, Clinton is focused on a serious issue. Cutting off Iran&apos;s oil money is critical to halting Iran&apos;s illegal nuclear program that menaces global security. It has to be done.

But something&apos;s off about the U.S. asking India to make sacrifices in shifting its oil suppliers without any corresponding U.S. effort to shift its own suppliers to give India more options.

The fact is, the U.S. is now buying record amounts of oil from Saudi Arabia, which is the most logical substitute supplier for India, leaving less for India to buy. This is notable because U.S. oil imports from Saudi Arabia soared 38% this year to an average of 1.4 million barrels a day, according to a March 16 Dow Jones Newswires report.

This is happening because the Obama administration is halting domestic energy production, both in refusing to drill offshore and in rejecting the U.S.-Canada Keystone XL pipeline, which Clinton&apos;s own State Department has a major role in blocking.

This shows the administration&apos;s stubborn focus on domestic politics to please campaign donors is undercutting U.S. diplomacy and global security.

            <title>North Dakota Oil Boom Should Inspire Federal Energy Policy   5.7.12</title>
            <description>Economic Growth: North Dakota&apos;s per-capita income jumped 78% in the past 12 years, largely due to its fossil fuel boom. Imagine the impact at the national level if Washington stopped blocking energy development.

North Dakota has become a land of prosperity since 2000, when its per-capita income was $25,592, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Last year it hit $45,747.

In energy-rich North Dakota, per-capita income growth of 78.7% is more than twice the national average of 37.4% over the last dozen years, and its per-capita income rank has risen from 38th in the nation to ninth.

North Dakota has the highest per-capita income in the BEA&apos;s Plains region and exceeds the national average by more than $4,000.

While the nation staggers through a sluggish, jobless recovery, North Dakota has the lowest unemployment rate in the country at 3.3%. The jobless rate in Williston, the core of the state&apos;s oil patch, which is fed by the Bakken Formation, is impossibly low at less than 1%.

The boom is happening across all of the state&apos;s industries, but it&apos;s the oil and gas sectors that are primarily stoking the fortunes. North Dakota is now the fourth-leading oil producer in the country, having passed Louisiana, and is on track to soon pass California for third.

North Dakota, which lies north of the flyover country that elitists look down on, is not a Barack Obama state.

            <title>EU Voters Nix Austerity, Though It&apos;s Not Been Tried  5.7.12</title>
            <description>Fiscal Policy: The stunning outcomes of elections in France, Greece and Italy were called &quot;a sweeping repudiation&quot; of austerity by more than one media outlet. But how can you repudiate something that&apos;s never been tried?

The EU tried austerity, but it didn&apos;t work. The media and Europe&apos;s beleaguered leftist politicians have made that their refrain, and apparently a lot of European voters now agree.

How else can you explain why French Socialist Francois Hollande ousted centrist incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy in Sunday&apos;s election — and why anti-austerity parties on the left and right made gains in Greece&apos;s parliamentary elections over the weekend?

Now, the left&apos;s argument goes, a new &quot;growth strategy&quot; premised on more government spending, not less, is needed — just like in Spain, Greece and Italy.

The only problem: The idea of EU austerity is a myth.

In fact, despite a lot of wailing, very few cuts have actually been made in Europe. Austerity? Starting in 2008, most governments enacted large stimulus packages.

Sadly, stimulus in Europe, as in the U.S., didn&apos;t work. As proof, the EU has now entered into its second recession in four years, with soaring debt, rising unemployment and few prospects for future growth.

            <title>The Unemployment Rate Is Meaningless   5.4.12</title>
            <description>Jobs: Normally, a drop in the unemployment rate would be a welcome sign of an economy on the mend. But in the upside-down world of Obamanomics, the jobless figure is increasingly useless, hiding more than it reveals.

In April, the unemployment rate officially declined to 8.1% from the previous month&apos;s 8.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But you don&apos;t have to look very hard to see that the jobs picture actually deteriorated last month.

In fact, the only reason the jobless rate didn&apos;t climb in April is because so many people have simply quit looking for jobs and didn&apos;t get counted as unemployed.

Last month, 342,000 people disappeared from the labor force. Had that not happened, the unemployment rate would have been 8.3%, not 8.1%.

Worse, the labor force participation rate has been on a downward slide throughout Obama&apos;s presidency, as millions of workers have given up their fruitless job searches (see chart). That also masks the size of the unemployment problem.

Had the participation rate stayed where it was in June 2009 — the month the recession officially ended — the unemployment rate would be more like 11% today.

And when you add in all those who can&apos;t get full-time work because of the lousy job market, the jobless rate reaches Depression-era levels of 14.5% — unchanged, by the way, from the month before.

            <title>Obama Hollows Out Military: Tanks For The Memories   5.4.12</title>
            <description>The Obama Record: The president&apos;s defense strategy creates a hollow force and worsens our readiness crisis. Big cuts mean weakening the military&apos;s ability to fulfill its constitutional duty to provide for the common defense.

Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the president&apos;s victory lap in Afghanistan on the anniversary of the death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of the Navy SEALs &quot;an attempt to shore up his national security credentials, because he has spent the past three years gutting our military.&quot;

Indeed he has. &quot;He cut the F-22, future combat system, C-17 and our ground-based interceptor in Poland, to name a few,&quot; Inhofe noted.

Those are many examples of how Barack Obama has exhibited a hostility to military preparedness even greater than that of Jimmy Carter, who left successor Ronald Reagan with a legacy of ships that couldn&apos;t sail and planes the couldn&apos;t fly for lack of parts and crew.

President Obama&apos;s defense policies fulfill a campaign pledge he made to the far-left group Caucus for Priorities a month before the January 2008 Iowa caucuses. Caucus for Priorities is an offshoot of a bigger group, Priorities Action Fund, created by Ben Cohen, the peace activist and co-founder of Ben &amp; Jerry&apos;s ice cream.

            <title>Russia Threatens Missile Defense As Obama Scuttles It     5.4.12</title>
            <description>National Security: Moscow threatens to strike our missile defense sites in Europe if we proceed, as missile defense advocates warn that the administration is defunding existing missiles in favor of future, theoretical versions.

&apos;A decision to use destructive force pre-emptively will be taken if the situation worsens,&quot; Russian Chief of General Staff Nikolai Makarov said at an international missile-defense conference in Moscow on Thursday, apparently not waiting for the &quot;flexibility&quot; President Obama told outgoing Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that his re-election would give him.

Makarov&apos;s blunt threat referred to administration plans to deploy the SM-3 IIB, a missile still on the drawing boards that is designed to be the replacement for the ground-based interceptors (GBI) that were scheduled for deployment in Poland, but scuttled by Obama after Russia threatened to deploy SS-26 Iskander missiles in Kaliningrad, right on the Polish border.

We&apos;ve heard such bluster before, and we&apos;ve seen President Obama cave in and betray our allies before.

President Obama scuttled those plans when the Russians protested, substituting a more modest layered defense capable of defending Europe — but not the continental U.S. — against Iranian missiles.

Typical of the way President Obama has treated loyal allies such as Britain and Israel, the Poles were notified with a midnight phone call on Sept. 17, 2009, the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion, telling them we were pulling the plug.

Typical of the way President Obama has treated loyal allies such as Britain and Israel, the Poles were notified with a midnight phone call on Sept. 17, 2009, the 70th anniversary of the Soviet invasion, telling them we were pulling the plug.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Flying Panetta Leads Charge Against The Carbon Enemy     5.4.12</title>
            <description>Nonsense: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says climate change is a national security issue. Isn&apos;t he the fellow who jets across the country to go home on weekends? If he&apos;s right, then he&apos;s undermining his own mission.

Speaking Wednesday to the Environmental Defense Fund, Panetta claimed: &quot;The area of climate change has a dramatic impact on national security.&quot; We&apos;ve heard this before. Rising sea levels, droughts, storms that are more frequent and intense — they&apos;re all going to cause people to migrate in mass numbers, become violent and start wars.

Five years ago the United Nations warned that global warming would create conflict. Two years back the Pentagon categorized it as a destabilizing force.

Panetta should be ashamed for pandering to an environmental group.

Since being named defense secretary in July, he has churned out tons of carbon dioxide, making more than two dozen trips from Washington to his family&apos;s walnut farm in Monterey, Calif. He flies in the privacy of a military jet, each round trip costing roughly $32,000.

            <title>Under Obama, U.S. Is No Beacon To Chinese Dissidents    5.3.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: The Obama administration&apos;s shoddy rebuff of a blind Chinese dissident seeking asylum underlines a sorry reality: The White House will sell out American interests for political advantage. Where is the courage?

Chen Guangcheng, 40, a blind Chinese human rights advocate of extraordinary courage, made a daring escape from an illegal house arrest last week and made his way to Beijing to stagger into the U.S. Embassy to seek asylum.

He was no ordinary applicant. The self-taught lawyer had been imprisoned for four years and continuously menaced by Chinese officials for the &quot;crime&quot; of standing up for the human dignity of rural China&apos;s people.

He exposed local abuses of China&apos;s &quot;one child&quot; policy such as forced abortion and sterilization.

Did the U.S. treat him with patience, respect and kindness, as our embassy staff did when seven Pentecostal dissidents fled into the U.S. Embassy in Moscow in 1978 to seek asylum, looking after them for five years?

Hardly. Chen was treated as an inconvenience by the embassy and tricked into returning to the clutches of his oppressors under phony pretenses: &quot;His choices and our values,&quot; Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said.

The Obama administration then hastily claimed to have resolved the inconvenience through a series of enticements. If Chen would remain in China, he could be resettled away from the local officials he&apos;d exposed.

            <title>NBC Wags Dog For Bill Clinton, Who Let Osama Escape   5.3.12</title>
            <description>Media: NBC&apos;s presentation of &quot;Rock Center with Brian Williams&quot; last Wednesday night demonstrated that MSNBC&apos;s Chris Matthews isn&apos;t the only one who feels tingles up his leg when he talks with or about President Obama.

President Obama&apos;s victory lap and shameless, media-assisted political exploitation of the Navy SEALs&apos; triumph continued with the program opening with the photograph taken in the White House Situation Room, now apparently open to public tours.

Administration bigwigs were shown watching the fruits of President George W. Bush&apos;s labors as Navy SEALs, acting on a trail of evidence gathered using enhanced interrogation techniques President Obama opposed, took out Osama bin Laden.

The president was shown sitting in the corner dressed in casual clothes, as he had rushed there after playing nine holes of golf at Andrews Air Force Base before heading to the Situation Room at around 2 p.m.

&quot;The picture,&quot; said Williams dramatically, &quot;was actually years in the making. When he was president, Bill Clinton spent 75 cruise missiles trying to kill bin Laden.&quot;

And missed 75 times, including those launched during the Monica Lewinsky affair and his impeachment. Close, but no cigar.&quot;

            <title>Obama Promises Women A Lifetime Of Dependence  5.3.12</title>
            <description>Election 2012: The Obama campaign website has a feature that&apos;s supposed to show how his policies will help a fictional &quot;Julia&quot; during her life. What it really shows is Obama&apos;s vision of cradle-to-grave government dependency.

The campaign&apos;s &quot;Life of Julia&quot; interactive feature tries to depict how Obama would help, and Romney would hurt, women in America.

It&apos;s so ridiculously amateurish, you have to wonder who&apos;s in charge of the $170 million the campaign has spent.

Still, it provides a window into Obama&apos;s warped worldview — one in which everything good that happens in America is due to some federal program or other.

Julia, for example, gets a good start on education only because of Head Start, and does well on her SATs only because of Obama&apos;s education programs.

She manages to get into college thanks to still more federal help. And when she gets a job, she can &quot;focus on her work&quot; because under ObamaCare &quot;health insurance is required to cover birth control.&quot;

The feature goes on until, after Julia spends the rest of her career dependent on government, Social Security lets &quot;her retire comfortably, without worrying that she&apos;ll run out of savings.&quot;

            <title>Do Romney&apos;s Reluctant Backers Have 2016 In Mind?    5.3.12</title>
            <description>Republicans: Why are some rivals so reluctant to support the man chosen by their party&apos;s voters? They&apos;ll deny it, of course, but they act as if they&apos;re looking ahead four years.

There comes a time in every presidential primary season when the winner has his — to borrow a term — Etch A Sketch moment, reframing the campaign for swing states and swing voters. Though it&apos;s too bad for Mitt Romney that his campaign wasn&apos;t more discreet about this, it&apos;s typically what has to happen.

The also-rans have their own pivots to perform. Not long after conceding defeat, they need to endorse the victor and take back all the mean things they said.

It&apos;s important to show some enthusiasm at this point and not grit one&apos;s teeth. And the lesser-of-two-evils approach doesn&apos;t cut it.

That&apos;s how it usually goes in a party that&apos;s heading toward the Nov. 6 election with confidence and conviction.

The coming weeks and months will tell if the Republicans get to that point. Right now certain contenders still seem to have trouble accepting the outcome of the primaries, the results of which are clear to everyone else.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Memoir A Tissue Of Lies    5.3.12</title>
            <description>Public Trust: Our president, it seems, is quite the fabulist. A new book reveals he fabricated yet another story in his 1995 memoir, this one about a white girlfriend complaining about black anger.

In his supposedly nonfiction memoir, &quot;Dreams From My Father,&quot; Obama claims he and the girlfriend got into a &quot;big fight&quot; after seeing a New York play by a black writer. He became annoyed when she allegedly asked &quot;why black people were so angry all the time.&quot;

Obama biographer David Maraniss contacted the former girlfriend, Genevieve Cook, who insists the scene never took place. She says they never even saw a show by a black playwright.

Maraniss, who works for the Washington Post, snagged an interview with the president and asked him about the discrepancy. Obama agreed with Cook&apos;s account.

So why did he make up the anecdote? He told Maraniss it was a &quot;useful theme to make about sort of the interactions that I had in the relationships with white girlfriends.&quot;

How convenient — especially when the overall theme of his bitter memoir is white racism.

Obama told another whopper in his autobiography. He wrote that while thumbing through a copy of Life magazine, he came across a story about a black man who underwent chemical treatments to lighten his skin. He claims he recoiled in horror at the photo of the bleached man, who looked like &quot;an albino.&quot;

            <title>As Economy Sputters, Obama Tries Distraction    5.2.12</title>
            <description>Economy: It&apos;s no wonder President Obama wants to direct everyone&apos;s attention to far-off Afghanistan these days. The economic news here at home is looking increasingly grim.

Just 28 days after Time magazine ran an April 2 cover story boasting that &quot;in the past few weeks, signs of economic expansion have been everywhere&quot; it warned that &quot;the economy might be stalling.&quot;

The article pointed to &quot;disappointing&quot; news that Q1 GDP had climbed just 2.2% — below expectations — and job growth in March was 120,000, also a miss.

Now, two more troubling signs have emerged. The government reported on Wednesday that new factory orders fell 1.5% in March, the steepest drop since March 2009, when the country was still in recession.

Then ADP reported that private employment climbed just 119,000 in April — the smallest gain in seven months and also far below expectations. The April employment report comes out Friday, which economists think will show an unimpressive 160,000 job gain.

Seems that, once again, all the talk about &quot;green shoots&quot; and &quot;turning the corner&quot; and reaching &quot;escape velocity&quot; are just more false hopes.

Instead, we&apos;re starting to get another round of economic reports that contain &quot;unexpectedly&quot; bad news.

What&apos;s surprising, though, isn&apos;t that the economy&apos;s still struggling nearly three years after

Just 28 days after Time magazine ran an April 2 cover story boasting that &quot;in the past few weeks, signs of economic expansion have been everywhere&quot; it warned that &quot;the economy might be stalling.&quot;

The article pointed to &quot;disappointing&quot; news that Q1 GDP had climbed just 2.2% — below expectations — and job growth in March was 120,000, also a miss.

Now, two more troubling signs have emerged. The government reported on Wednesday that new factory orders fell 1.5% in March, the steepest drop since March 2009, when the country was still in recession.

Then ADP reported that private employment climbed just 119,000 in April — the smallest gain in seven months and also far below expectations. The April employment report comes out Friday, which economists think will show an unimpressive 160,000 job gain.

Seems that, once again, all the talk about &quot;green shoots&quot; and &quot;turning the corner&quot; and reaching &quot;escape velocity&quot; are just more false hopes.

Instead, we&apos;re starting to get another round of economic reports that contain &quot;unexpectedly&quot; bad news.

What&apos;s surprising, though, isn&apos;t that the economy&apos;s still struggling nearly three years after</itunes:summary>

            <title>Who Are British Lawmakers To Judge Rupert Murdoch?   5.2.12</title>
            <description>Business: A committee in Britain&apos;s Parliament has decided that Rupert Murdoch is unfit to run an international corporation. And what experience do these men have that entitles them to make such a statement?

Six members of a 10-lawmaker committee believe Murdoch is responsible for a phone-hacking scandal that has rocked his British media group and say he &quot;is not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company.&quot;

According to the report, &quot;News International and its parent News Corporation exhibited willful blindness, for which the companies&apos; directors — including Rupert Murdoch and James Murdoch — should ultimately take responsibility.&quot;

Had the lawmakers left it at that, they&apos;d get little argument. The leadership has to accept responsibility.

But for the lawmakers to claim that the 81-year-old Murdoch should not be running a global enterprise such as News Corp. goes too far.

Five of the six committee members who endorsed the 85-page report are from the Labour Party. The sixth is a Liberal Democrat. The committee&apos;s four Conservatives, seeing a political hit job, refused to support it.

The crusade against Murdoch was led by Tom Watson. A seasoned businessman? Hardly.

            <title>Decoding Obama&apos;s Leftist Campaign Codewords   5.2.12</title>
            <description>Propaganda: The Obama campaign&apos;s new slogan, &quot;Forward,&quot; has long ties to Marxism and communism. Coincidence? Not likely. This president has a habit of speaking in code to fellow travelers.

As the Washington Times notes, &quot;Forward!&quot; captures &quot;the conviction of European Marxists and radicals that their movements reflected the march of history, which would move forward past capitalism and into socialism and communism.&quot;

In 1905, V.I. Lenin founded the communist organ &quot;Vpered,&quot; Russian for &quot;forward,&quot; and Leon Trotsky wrote for a German socialist paper called &quot;Forward.&quot;

Obama&apos;s new slogan, released in a campaign video, follows another video reintroducing the president to voters. Its title, &quot;The Road We&apos;ve Traveled,&quot; is almost identical to the title of a book by an American socialist.

Published in 1942 by economist Stuart Chase, &quot;The Road We Are Traveling&quot; extols the virtues of the New Deal, a phrase he&apos;s credited with coining.

Chase, who admired the Soviet&apos;s planned economy, also is famous for the quote: &quot;Why should Russians have all the fun remaking a world?&quot;

            <title>Obama Is America&apos;s Biggest Job Outsourcer   5.2.12</title>
            <description>Jobs: The same president who used stimulus dollars to build electric cars in Finland and sought to be Brazil&apos;s best oil customer now complains the GOP nominee built his career outsourcing jobs. At least he created some.

President Obama&apos;s re-election campaign released an ad Tuesday saying Mitt Romney &quot;shipped American jobs to places like Mexico and China&quot; when he led the investment firm Bain Capital.

The $780,000 ad buy in the key swing states of Ohio, Iowa and Virginia was in response to an ad by the free-market group Americans for Prosperity (AFP) noting the administration&apos;s penchant for wasting taxpayer money in support of green energy companies, particularly those overseas or with foreign owners.

Among other things, AFP noted, the Obama administration approved a plan by electric car company Fisker to use part of its $529 million federal stimulus loan guarantee to build its manufacturing facility, and the 500 jobs it supports, in Finland.

Now comes Obama&apos;s counterattack — an odd charge since he seeks to block the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada that would create 20,000 jobs fast and hundreds of thousands of jobs in an economic ripple effect.

            <title>Obama Abuses Bravery Of Others For Political Gain   5.1.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: If President Obama isn&apos;t careful, he might get injured slapping himself on the back for killing Osama bin Laden. Spiking the football in such an obviously political way is conduct unbecoming of a commander in chief.

gjaclThe recent unseemly comments by Obama and his attempt to turn a successful military operation into a campaign stunt show a sad political desperation by our nation&apos;s leader.

It&apos;s bad enough Obama takes credit for the Navy SEALs&apos; achievement. But this time an Obama campaign video, &quot;One Chance,&quot; suggests Mitt Romney wouldn&apos;t be man enough to do what Obama did.

Or as the video asks, &quot;Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?&quot; As if there was really any question.

Romney responded to the political cheap shot by urging Obama not to let the killing of bin Laden become a &quot;politically divisive event&quot; — sensible, mature advice.

For the record, IBD strongly supported the operation to take out bin Laden. And we gave the president kudos at the time for letting the operation go forward.

But we&apos;re troubled as we mark the first anniversary of SEAL Team 6&apos;s successful raid against the world&apos;s most infamous terrorist. We should be solemnly remembering bin Laden&apos;s thousands of victims — and showing gratitude to the American men and women still fighting in the Mideast to protect us from future terrorist atrocities — not listening to a president&apos;s juvenile gloating.

            <title>For The Truth About ObamaCare, Just Follow The Money    5.1.12</title>
            <description>ObamaCare: Yet another study — this one a survey of America&apos;s largest firms — shows why employers will drop health coverage for their workers once they do the math and see how much they can save.

It&apos;s no longer news that President Obama isn&apos;t even close to keeping his promise to preserve the employer-paid health coverage enjoyed by tens of millions of Americans. But that fact bears repeating, especially since it keeps getting confirmed by new data.

The latest piece of evidence comes from a confidential survey of Fortune 100 firms. It&apos;s a Republican report, produced by the House Ways and Means Committee&apos;s majority staff, but Democrats will be kidding themselves if they dismiss it as a mere partisan screed. That&apos;s because the survey&apos;s central finding makes objective sense:

Under ObamaCare, these large employers can save serious money by dropping coverage. Among the 71 firms responding, the estimated savings come to $28.6 billion in 2014 alone and $422.4 billion through 2023. This is despite the law&apos;s penalty of $2,000 per full-time employee paid by companies that decide not to pay for coverage. The net savings per dropped employee would be $4,821, on an after-tax basis, in 2014.

The companies were not asked what they intend to do, but their financial incentives are clear. The new survey also jibes with other research suggesting that many firms would shift their covered workers to tax-subsidized insurance exchanges.

A 2011 McKinsey &amp; Co. survey said 30% of employers &quot;definitely or probably&quot; would end coverage. The Congressional Budget Office, which initially played down the potential shift to the exchanges, said in March that up to 20 million could be dropped by employer plans.

            <title>Occupy&apos;s Descent Into Mobbery Threatens Democracy   5.1.12</title>
            <description>The Left: After a day of mayhem, Occupy protesters have shown themselves to be little more than a dangerous mob. Democrats coddle them even as their outrages escalate. Criminal behavior has no place in a democracy.

After turning New York and other cities&apos; public parks into open sewers with their extended camp-outs last year, the left-wing protestors of Occupy had little more to do than look for ways to remain relevant after public sentiment turned on them, crowds thinned and donations dried up.

By descending into a mob that is the antithesis of democracy, they found one.

May Day arrived and suddenly Occupy decided the holiday of the international left was its ticket to getting names in the news again.

But instead of peacefully assembling to present their dog&apos;s breakfast of causes — from hating capitalism, to amnesty for illegal aliens, to halting foreclosures — they descended into violence and criminality that can only mean worse to come.

Five anarchists were arrested in Cleveland by the FBI for trying to bomb a bridge. Authorities said they had a wish list of other targets, including the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, the Justice Center of Cleveland and another bridge. Two of the arrested — Brandon Baxter and Anthony Hayne — were named in past news reports as leaders of Occupy Cleveland.

            <title>Obama Lies To Union That Supports Keystone XL Pipeline   5.1.12</title>
            <description>Politics: The president tells building-and-trades union workers that Republicans have blocked multiple bills putting them to work, even as he blocks an oil pipeline their former union chief supported.

President Obama may have thought he was preaching to the choir when he addressed the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department Legislative Conference on Monday, blaming Republicans for blocking his attempts at job creation.

But he forgot one of the cardinal rules of public speaking — know your audience.

&quot;I&apos;ve said now is the time to do this, interest rates are low, construction workers are out of work ... and time after time, the Republicans have gotten together and they&apos;ve said no,&quot; Obama told a packed ballroom at the Washington Hilton.

Left off the teleprompter was the fact that he was speaking to a union group, one of many that has endorsed the union-job-creating Keystone XL pipeline, an issue he dodged in his speech.

&quot;For America&apos;s skilled craft construction professionals, any discussion of the Keystone XL project begins and ends with one word: JOBS,&quot; Mark Ayers, past head of the group, wrote in the Huffington Post last November. He noted that &quot;the Keystone pipeline represents the prospect for 20,000 immediate jobs, and as many as 500,000 indirect jobs via a strong economic multiplier effect.&quot;

            <itunes:summary>Politics: The president tells building-and-trades union workers that Republicans have blocked multiple bills putting them to work, even as he blocks an oil pipeline their former union chief supported.

President Obama may have thought he was preaching to the choir when he addressed the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades Department Legislative Conference on Monday, blaming Republicans for blocking his attempts at job creation.

But he forgot one of the cardinal rules of public speaking — know your audience.

            <title>Obama Pushes False GM Success Story   4.30.12</title>
            <description>Politics: The Obama camp can&apos;t stop clucking about how he saved GM and the car industry. But if the GM bailout is such a success story, why can&apos;t it pay back its debt to taxpayers?

The president&apos;s new campaign video narrated by actor Tom Hanks claims GM has &quot;repaid&quot; its loans. But in a revelation by the special inspector general monitoring the TARP bailout program, GM and GMAC together still owe the biggest share of the remaining $119 billion TARP debt.

Of the top bailout recipients, GM is the biggest laggard, the TARP watchdog says in his latest quarterly report to Congress. Bank of America, Citigroup, Chrysler and Chrysler Financial all have paid off their debt and left the TARP program. Even AIG has paid back more than 75% of what it owes taxpayers.

GM, on the other hand, still owes more than half the $50 billion in federal funds it received when the combination of the recession and its costly union contracts drove it into bankruptcy. And its lending arm, GMAC (now Ally Financial), still owes $14.5 billion.

What&apos;s worse, it&apos;s not clear that GM actually repaid what it&apos;s gotten credit for repaying. Check out this note buried in the inspector&apos;s report: &quot;As part of a credit agreement with Treasury, $16.4 billion in TARP funds were placed in an escrow account that GM could access only with Treasury&apos;s permission.&quot;

            <title>ObamaCare Will Reignite Health Inflation    4.30.12</title>
            <description>Health Reform: The New York Times just discovered that the nation&apos;s health care system was on the mend before ObamaCare took effect. Too bad it didn&apos;t tell its readers how Obama&apos;s &quot;reforms&quot; will destroy this progress.

The Sunday Times article — &quot;In Hopeful Sign, Health Spending Is Flattening Out&quot; — didn&apos;t break any new ground. The numbers the reporter used have been around since January. But it was a tacit admission by the paper that the health care system was not in a state of crisis before ObamaCare.

Quite the opposite, in fact. As the story notes, annual increases in health spending had been trending downward for years, to the point where they climbed less than 4% in 2009 and 2010.

This isn&apos;t the only good news. The Times story doesn&apos;t mention it, but premium increases had also been moderating over the past several years. While some of the slowdown was due to the recession, the Times notes that it &quot;was sharper than health economists expected,&quot; and quotes a former Obama health adviser as saying that &quot;I think there&apos;s much more going on.&quot;

            <title>Presidents Of A Feather: Can Clinton Save Obama?   4.30.12</title>
            <description>Politics: The president who wagged the dog and let bin Laden get away raises millions for the president who jokes about eating one while taking credit for Osama&apos;s death. A deal for Hillary as veep, perhaps?

Politics makes strange bedfellows, the cliche goes. In 2008, Hillary Clinton waged a protracted and sometimes bitter battle for the Democratic presidential nomination against a former community organizer and absentee state senator from Illinois only to wind up as President Obama&apos;s secretary of state.

Husband and former President Bill Clinton even made racially tinged remarks about Obama&apos;s primary victory over Hillary in the South Carolina primary.

That was then and this is now, and maybe &quot;strange&quot; is not the word to use after Bill Clinton appeared in Obama&apos;s campaign opus about Obama beheading the al-Qaida dragon and appearing at a backyard fundraiser outside the home of former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe that pulled in some $2 million for Obama&apos;s re-election coffers.

Obama, who rails against alleged Republican intransigence as the root of all his problems, needs all the help he can get from the man who got re-elected by working with Republicans, led by then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, producing balanced budgets and a pay-down of the national debt in the process.

Clinton was elected using the slogan, &quot;It&apos;s the economy, stupid.&quot; President Obama may be defeated by GOP nominee Mitt Romney&apos;s observation, &quot;It&apos;s still the economy, and we&apos;re not stupid.&quot;

            <title>Washington Has A Habit Of Trying To Fix What Isn&apos;t Broken   4.30.12</title>
            <description>Nanny State: The Obama administration&apos;s Secretary of Meddling continues his senseless war against cellphone use in cars. Don&apos;t the busybodies in Washington ever tire of coming up with solutions in search of a problem?

Ray LaHood, who is actually Transportation secretary and a one-time a Republican congressman, wants to ban talking and texting on cellphones on every road and street in the country. Not only is this a local issue and not a federal case, it is also a fix that isn&apos;t needed.

Look at the data. The effort to ban cellphone use by drivers is based on a National Highway Transportation Safety Administration finding that says 3,000 were killed across the country last year in traffic accidents caused by distracted driving. But distracted driving is more than cellphone use.

Distracted-driving fatalities are caused by activities that include talking to passengers, using electric razors, apply cosmetics, looking at a wreck in the next lane, trying to find an address and daydreaming. Where are the campaigns to shut down any of these practices?

Eating and drinking behind the wheel, something we all do, is the worst offense. They cause 80% of all car wrecks. Slugging coffee is responsible for most of them.

NHTSA data show that among car crashes resulting from distracted driving, the distraction is cellphone use in fewer than 20% of deaths and 5% of injuries.

            <description>Media Bias: Reporters normally cast a jaundiced eye at a political campaign&apos;s PR strategy. Yet they are eagerly parroting the Obama campaign&apos;s talking point about how &quot;cool&quot; the president is.

In early February, Politico reported that the Obama campaign, hoping to rekindle enthusiasm among young voters, was &quot;looking to revive the cool appeal.&quot; Then, suddenly, news stories started popping up about Obama&apos;s alleged coolness, in contrast to that drip Romney. A sampling:

• President Obama: The cool factor

• &apos;Cool&apos; Obama Returns GOP Fire on Gas Prices

• Obama: The new King of Cool

• Barack Obama is cool. Mitt Romney is not. What does it mean for 2012?

• Campaigning for the &apos;Cool&apos; Vote

• The Obama-Romney &apos;Cool Gap&apos;

            <title>Undoing Glass-Steagall Did Not Cause Crisis   4.27.12</title>
            <description>Subprime Scandal: Exiting Citigroup Chairman Richard Parsons tried to soothe Occupy Wall Street protestors by claiming deregulation caused the mortgage meltdown. It&apos;s a convenient story. Only, it&apos;s not true.

&apos;To some extent what we saw in the 2007-08 crash was the result of the throwing off of Glass-Steagall,&quot; Parsons said, referring to the 1999 repeal of the banking law that separated banks from investment banks and insurers.

Parsons made the remarks last week following a restive annual shareholder meeting of the bank.

The Glass-Steagall excuse has been thoroughly litigated and discredited. It&apos;s another red herring to take a confused public off the scent of the real culprit: overregulation of the mortgage industry. Of course, that&apos;s the last thing community organizers crashing the annual meetings of regulated banks want to hear.

There&apos;s no evidence any bank, including Citibank, got into trouble because of a securities or insurance affiliate. The banks that suffered subprime losses were engaged in activities — namely, mortgage lending — that were always permitted by Glass-Steagall.

And none of them was affiliated at the time with the investment banks that got into trouble

            <description>Killing Bin Laden: Like so many others, the final decision to pull the trigger on the world&apos;s most-wanted man was delegated to an admiral who undoubtedly would have been thrown under the bus had the mission failed.

It&apos;s been almost a year since President Obama&apos;s leadership and foreign policy bona fides were allegedly established by the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. A campaign film narrated by Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks tells of the president&apos;s alleged solitary, agonizing decision.

With apologies to Vice President Biden, maybe President Obama doesn&apos;t carry quite as big a stick as Joe would lead us to believe.

As reported by Big Peace, Time magazine has obtained a memo written by Leon Panetta, then-director of the Central Intelligence Agency and now-Secretary of Defense, that says &quot;operational decision-making and control&quot; was really in the hands of William McRaven, a three-star admiral and former Navy SEAL.

&quot;The timing, operational decision-making and control are in Adm. McRaven&apos;s hands,&quot; the memo says. &quot;The approval is provided on the risk profile presented to the president. Any additional risks are to be brought back to the president for his consideration. The direction is to go in and get bin Laden and, if he is not there, to get out.&quot;

In other words, it was McRaven&apos;s call to pull the trigger or not on the raid.

            <title>Weak First-Quarter GDP Shows Failure Of Obmanomics   4.27.12</title>
            <description>Economy: The first estimate for early 2012 is in, and it&apos;s not pretty. GDP grew just 2.2% — way below expectations. The &quot;Obama recovery&quot; the media keep touting is looking more and more like a fraud.

Since entering office, President Obama has presided over the worst recovery since the Great Depression. While the recovery began just four months after Obama took office, since then GDP growth has averaged just 2.4% at a yearly rate. Pathetic.

At a less-than-3% growth rate, the economy won&apos;t even create enough jobs to sop up the 130,000 or so people who enter the workforce each month, much less the 14 million or so who are officially unemployed.

Since the recession ended in June of 2009, the average number of jobs created each month has been 70,000. That&apos;s why the jobless rate has stayed above 8% since the early months of Obama&apos;s time in the White House.

And that&apos;s also why we have 1.6 million fewer jobs today than when Obama first stepped into office. Obama&apos;s policies have created a massive growth deficit.

            <title>Democrats Have Nothing to Offer But Fear Itself    4.25.12</title>
            <description>Governing: Asked why the Senate hasn&apos;t produced a budget in three years, the head of the Democratic Party instead stoked fear about the &quot;Romney-Ryan budget that ends Medicare as we know it.&quot; FDR, call your office.

&apos;The Romney/Ryan budget is painful for Americans,&quot; head Debbie Wasserman Schultz said on that same Fox News program.

Her comments are tame compared with what other Democrats have said, including President Obama, who called Rep. Paul Ryan&apos;s budget &quot;thinly veiled social Darwinism&quot; that would &quot;impose a radical vision on our country&quot; and that is &quot;antithetical to our entire history.&quot;

So what do Democrats have to offer instead? Nothing.

The Senate hasn&apos;t produced a budget since 2009 and refuses to this year, which means that once again the red-ink hemorrhaging federal government will be operating without any spending guidelines. Obama&apos;s budget plan was so ludicrous that not one House Democrat would vote for it.

The Democrats&apos; refusal to govern hardly ends here.

The country faces monumental problems — a national debt crisis, an entitlement crisis, an energy crisis, to say nothing of the lingering economic crisis.

            <title>Romney: It&apos;s Still The Economy And We&apos;re Not Stupid   4.25.12</title>
            <description>Campaign 2012: Putting aside 59-point plans, the certain Republican nominee for president now frames the debate in terms of our children&apos;s future. Will we toss away the faux Greek columns for a real American renaissance?

In what was billed as his de facto acceptance of the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney took the stage in New Hampshire Tuesday night on the heels of a five-state primary sweep and told President Barack Obama, &quot;game on.&quot;

Stepping out of the boardroom and onto the stump, the challenger spoke in plain English and turned a famous slogan from the 1992 Clinton campaign into a battle cry for freedom, using words everyday Americans can understand as gas prices rise and millions leave the workforce in despair.

Romney said he will not accept Obama&apos;s rich vs. poor class-warfare mantra, nor will he apologize for his own success. He applauded the dreams of his father, former Michigan Gov. George Romney, and echoed the dreams of fathers across America who worry about an America in which half of college graduates can&apos;t find jobs and the only thing we&apos;re leaving our children is an unconscionable debt and a generation in hock to the Chinese.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Rent-A-Thugs Storm Banks In New Shakedown   4.25.12</title>
            <description>Subprime Scandal: The radicals who caused the mortgage crisis by shaking down banks for risky loans now demand they forgive those loans. Bankers must fight this theft.

It won&apos;t be easy. The radicals have launched a coordinated attack against them on three fronts: corporate shareholder meetings, the courts and Fannie Mae&apos;s and Freddie Mac&apos;s conservator.

First the street war.

Some 1,000 protesters stormed Wells Fargo&apos;s shareholder meeting Tuesday in San Francisco. Claiming to hold stock certificates, about 20 got into the building and interrupted Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf at least four times.

One protester shouted: &quot;Mr. Stumpf, your bank leads the pack in foreclosures, tax-dodging, predatory loans and investing in private prisons — can you tell us why these issues don&apos;t concern you?&quot;

Another yelled: &quot;When will you stop illegally foreclosing on millions of Americans and stop preying on the 99%?&quot;

Since they were out of order, Stumpf wisely had security escort them out. About two dozen were arrested outside as they chained themselves together to block the entrance.

In February, about 100 protesters showed up at Stumpf&apos;s house to demand the &quot;evil robber banker&quot; stop foreclosures on people who can&apos;t make their mortgage payments. Stumpf had to call security to block the crowd.

            <title>ExxonMobil Deal With Russia Underscores U.S. Oil Folly   4.25.12</title>
            <description>Oil: First, some very good news on the energy front: Exxon Mobil is set to drill into a massive, 85-billion-barrel arctic oil reserve that will soon be gushing crude. Now the bad news: They&apos;re doing it for Russia, not America.

aclbfOn the surface, the $3.2 billion deal between Exxon Mobil and Russia&apos;s state oil producer, Rosneft, doesn&apos;t look so big. But it could turn into the largest oil deal ever.

Indeed, the projects in Russia&apos;s Arctic region and on the Black Sea could be huge, with oilfields in Russia&apos;s frozen north holding up to 85 billion barrels of crude.

If the oil flows as expected, total investment could hit $500 billion, or 18% of Russia&apos;s gross domestic product, with pumping to begin in 2020.

As part of the deal, Rosneft gets a bigger piece of the U.S. energy market — a one-third stake in three major Exxon Mobil offshore and shale oil projects here in the U.S., the Gulf of Mexico and Canada.

So why can&apos;t Exxon Mobil do a similar gigantic project here? The sadly disturbing answer is, President Obama won&apos;t let them.

Federal lands have largely been closed to all oil development. Roughly 97% of our Offshore Continental Shelf is shut. Major fields in Alaska and the Arctic have likewise been kept from development.

            <title>Illegal Exodus Shows Jobs Matter More Than Handouts  4.25.12</title>
            <description>The Law: President Obama&apos;s Huey Long-style government spending has showered benefits on illegals. That&apos;s ironic, because for the first time since the 1930s they would now rather live in Mexico. Maybe jobs matter after all.

At a Hispanic Community Action Summit led by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa this month, 39 federal officials from agencies ranging from ICE to the EPA courted hundreds of Hispanic activists with one message: Claim your government benefits.

They offered up goodies from food aid to educational benefits to help in fighting deportation.

The outreach, said a conference organizer, was based on a &quot;community organizing&quot; approach of asking Latinos what they wanted and giving it to them.

Well, according to a new study by Pew Hispanic Center, plenty just want jobs, not handouts. Mexican illegal immigrants — about 70% of the 10 million-plus illegals in the U.S. — are leaving America in droves.

            <title>Terror Defeated? Ask Afghans, Iranians and Egyptians   4.24.12</title>
            <description>War On Terror: The State Department declaring the global war on terror over is no surprise, even with Islamism thriving worldwide. The Obama administration never believed there was such a war.

The Taliban is regaining control in Afghanistan, Islamofascist Iran is building the atomic bomb for its ruling ayatollah, and in Egypt a leading presidential contender says a council of Muslim scholars should advise Parliament on how best to impose Shariah law.

But never mind any of that; the Department of State has just triumphantly declared the global war on terror to be over and won.

Hadn&apos;t you heard that Osama bin Laden was killed and buried at sea, the man who was literally the living embodiment of terrorism for so many simple-mindedly dovish liberal Democratic politicians?

&quot;The war on terror is over,&quot; an anonymous &quot;senior State Department official who works on Mideast issues&quot; told the National Journal recently. &quot;Now that we have killed most of al-Qaida, now that people have come to see legitimate means of expression, people who once might have gone into al-Qaida see an opportunity for a legitimate Islamism.&quot;

How is this statement a sign of American foreign policy naivete and an invitation for aggression?

            <title>Environmentalist Icon Says He Overstated Climate Change   4.24.12</title>
            <description>Cool Down: Not many years ago, a celebrated scientist predicted a global warming disaster awaited humanity. Today, that same scientist admits his warning was too &quot;alarmist.&quot; It&apos;s time Al Gore turned his limousine around, too.

James Lovelock, father of the &quot;Gaia&quot; theory that the entire earth is a single living system, was one of the many voices that&apos;s predicted environmental calamity will result from carbon dioxide emissions.

He claimed in 2006 that &quot;before this century is over billions of us will die and the few breeding pairs of people that survive will be in the Arctic where the climate remains tolerable.&quot;

But he has told MSNBC that he overstated the case and now acknowledges that &quot;we don&apos;t know what the climate is doing.&quot;

&quot;We thought we knew 20 years ago,&quot; he said. &quot;That led to some alarmist books — mine included — because it looked clear-cut, but it hasn&apos;t happened.&quot;

The 92-year-old Lovelock notes that &quot;the climate is doing its usual tricks&quot; and concedes &quot;there&apos;s nothing much really happening yet&quot; even though &quot;we were supposed to be halfway toward a frying world now.&quot;

            <title>Obama Fought Oil And Lost; Now It’s Back To Reality  4.24.12</title>
            <description>Energy: The administration has tried for three years to kick-start a &quot;green economy.&quot; But fossil fuels still dominate for lots of good reasons. It&apos;s time for a return to reality.

Over the past several weeks, this page has presented a series of editorials that aim to sort fact from fiction in energy economics. Readers by now may have noticed a common theme — that the Obama administration has consistently refused to learn the lessons of the market.

Nowhere is this clearer than in its quixotic, expensive effort to create a new economy that no longer depends on oil. That quest is a failure, though we doubt if the president will admit as much.

America is waking up to the fact that it has an abundance of oil and natural gas within its own borders, along with ample reserves just across the border in Canada. And production is on the rise for the first time in decades.

After hitting bottom in September 2008 — when its total of 117.9 million barrels was the lowest since World War II — domestic crude oil production has bounded back smartly. In January of this year, according to the Energy Information Administration, it reached 188.9 million barrels, a monthly total not seen since the 1990s.

            <title>Arizona Defends SB 1070: Border In The Court  4.24.12</title>
            <description>Immigration: In an unusual move, Arizona&apos;s immigration law comes before the Supreme Court before its adjudication by lower courts. Will the high court let states protect their borders by enforcing federal laws the feds won&apos;t?

The federal challenge to Arizona&apos;s SB 1070, the state law designed to help stem the flow of illegal aliens, is headed to an unexpectedly earlier resolution as the Supreme Court has expedited its review and begins hearing oral arguments on Wednesday. This can&apos;t be good news for an administration at war with both Arizona and the courts and already fearful that its landmark legislation, ObamaCare, will soon be overturned as unconstitutional.

Arizona argues that SB 1070 complements rather than infringes upon existing federal law and is necessary because the administration refuses to vigorously enforce its own laws. The administration argues that immigration is a federal, not state, responsibility — a responsibility Arizona argues the feds continue to shirk.

The legislation grants state and local police the power to check the immigration status of those with whom they come into contact when they have probable cause to suspect that person may be here illegally. It also requires that legal immigrants carry proof of their status with them, something that&apos;s already required by federal law.

            <title>As EU Nears Collapse, Will U.S. Follow Suit?   4.23.12</title>
            <description>Fiscal Policy: A turn to the left in French elections and the collapse of the Dutch government do not bode well for the future of the European Union. If the U.S. is smart, it will learn something from the EU&apos;s debacle.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy lost Sunday in the first round of elections to Socialist candidate Francois Hollande, as far-right candidate Marine Le Pen siphoned off 18% of the votes.

Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, Prime Minister Mark Rutte resigned and dissolved his government, as talks over EU austerity broke down.

This comes just hours after the IMF boosted the bailout fund for Europe another $430 billion and just weeks after the 25 nations of the EU signed a &quot;Pact for Budget Discipline&quot; requiring members to cap spending, slash deficits and shrink the size of government.

Wasn&apos;t that enough? Apparently not. Events in Holland and France show why the EU may be heading for breakup — no matter how many bailouts it gets.

The Dutch once openly sneered at others, like Greece, Italy and Spain, who were in deep fiscal trouble. Now their government has collapsed.

In France, the socialist Hollande collected 28.6% of the vote — less than the majority needed to form a government — but still more than Sarkozy&apos;s 27%.

            <title>Nancy Pelosi Seeks To Rewrite First Amendment  4.23.12</title>
            <description>Free Speech: The former speaker, echoing the president, says the Supreme Court got it wrong in ruling we have the right to pool our money for purposes of political speech.

Leave it to Nancy Pelosi, who said we had to pass ObamaCare in order to find out what&apos;s in it, to suggest that a document we had well over two centuries to read was misinterpreted by the court in its Citizens United decision wherein it held that corporations and unions can spend unlimited amounts on political advocacy as long as they do not coordinate with candidates or campaigns.

Pelosi, at a press briefing last Thursday, endorsed a movement announced by other congressional Democrats the day before to ratify an amendment to the Constitution to allow Congress to regulate political speech when it is engaged in by corporations as opposed to individuals.

&quot;Our Founders had an idea. It was called democracy. It said elections are determined by the people, the voice and the vote of the people, not by the bankrolls of the privileged few. This Supreme Court decision flies in the face of our Founders&apos; vision, and we want to reverse it,&quot; Pelosi said even as the ObamaCare she shepherded threatens to shred both the First and Tenth Amendments.

            <title>Obama&apos;s $8.3 Billion Re-Election Slush Fund   4.23.12</title>
            <description>Medicare: Backers like to say the more people know about ObamaCare, the more they&apos;ll like it. So why is the administration spending $8.3 billion to hide a key provision from millions of seniors until after the election?

That&apos;s precisely what administration officials are doing right now as a way to mask the effect of ObamaCare&apos;s deep cuts to the popular Medicare Advantage program.

Championed by Republicans in 1997, Medicare Advantage offers seniors an escape valve from the creaky, government-run Medicare insurance program.

The idea was that private insurance companies could better manage costs than the government&apos;s own top-down insurance plan, and give enrollees more and better benefits while still saving taxpayers money.

Medicare Advantage has proved popular with seniors, 12 million of whom have enrolled. But the left loathes it, arguing that Medicare overpays insurance companies, thereby ripping off taxpayers to enrich this industry.

Obama himself long complained about Medicare Advantage while running for office and while pitching ObamaCare.

In his 2009 health care speech to Congress, he said Medicare Advantage offered &quot;unwarranted subsidies&quot; that &quot;do everything to pad (insurance company) profits and nothing to improve your care.&quot; And he repeatedly vowed to &quot;eliminate&quot; these subsidies.

ObamaCare delivered — targeting Medicare Advantage for $145 billion in spending cuts over the next 10 years, equal to almost 30% of ObamaCare&apos;s planned Medicare cuts.

            <title>Your Tax-Free Nest Egg May Not Be Tax-Free After All   4.23.12</title>
            <description>Duplicity: More than 30 years ago, lawmakers made a deal with Americans: Set up a retirement nest egg and we&apos;ll let you fill it with tax-free money. A financially troubled Washington now plans to break its word.

Nothing brought ordinary Americans into the world of investing like 401(k)s. Named after a subsection of the Internal Revenue Code, these retirement savings accounts have become a wildly popular alternative to traditional employer pensions, and are today owned by a sizeable majority of Americans at or near retirement.

Through 401(k)s, an employee — not the company he or she works for — decides just how aggressive or cautious he wants to be with money set aside for the autumnal years. Employers usually offer a series of stock, bond and money market investment funds, allowing a worker to choose and mix as he or she likes.

Not only would Americans see their own retirement accounts grow as the years passed, but they could rest easy knowing that the interest earned in their 401(k) won&apos;t be taxed before withdrawal at retirement time — or, in the case of the after-tax dollars in a Roth 401(k), that their money can be withdrawn tax-free.

            <title>Obama Administration&apos;s Energy Policy A Boon To Petrotyrants   4.23.12</title>
            <description>Strategy: Wittingly or not, President Obama has contributed to high oil prices by stymieing U.S. production. But if that&apos;s the idea, it makes sense to secure energy abroad. He hasn&apos;t.

In fact, Obama&apos;s stated policy, in his March 30, 2011, energy speech has been a crude central planner&apos;s diktat of reducing oil imports by a third over the next 10 years and replacing them with increased production of biofuels and other unproven &quot;green&quot; energies yet to be developed.

Net result: high oil prices and reduced U.S. access to overseas suppliers. A shrewder strategy would have been to secure energy supplies from local sources in the hemisphere while giving the green light to energy development back home.

Scroll back to 1992 and the first Summit of the Americas. The strategy endorsed by the U.S. under the first Bush administration was to &quot;develop the energy industry within the hemisphere&quot; through free markets.

By the second Summit in 1998, then-Energy Secretary Bill Richardson proposed a strategy of ramped-up production from Venezuela, Brazil, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Mexico and Colombia.

            <title>Democrats Are Jumping Ship  4.20.12</title>
            <description>Politics: Perhaps Democrats know something the rest of us don&apos;t about Barack Obama&apos;s political fortunes. What else explains the increasing numbers who are openly defying the president on two key election issues?

The notoriously thin-skinned Obama could not have been happy with the news last week that, as the Hill newspaper put it, &quot;an increasing number of Democrats are taking potshots at President Obama&apos;s health care law.&quot;

North Carolina&apos;s Brad Miller, who voted for the law, now laments that &quot;we would all have been better off&quot; if Congress had dealt with more pressing issues &quot;and then came back to health care.&quot;

Barney Frank complained that the Democrats &quot;paid a terrible price for health care.&quot; And Virginia&apos;s outgoing Sen. Jim Webb said the law would be Obama&apos;s &quot;biggest downside&quot; in the election and had cost him &quot;a lot of credibility as a leader.&quot;

Meanwhile, stalwart Massachusetts liberal Elizabeth Warren is now calling to repeal a piece of ObamaCare — the 2.3% tax on medical devices — because, she says, it &quot;disproportionately impacts the small companies with the narrowest financial margins.&quot;

Warren, by the way, is running for the Senate seat occupied by Republican Scott Brown, whose victory in 2010 was a result of the public&apos;s intense opposition to ObamaCare.

Former Alabama Rep. Artur Davis went furthest. &quot;I think the Affordable Care Act is the single least popular piece of major domestic legislation in the last 70 years,&quot; he said. &quot;It was not popular when it passed; it&apos;s less popular now.&quot; Ouch.

            <title>First Home-Lending Quotas, Now Fruit-Stocking Quotas?   4.20.12</title>
            <description>Nanny-Statism: The housing secretary has joined the first lady in scolding grocers for leaving fresh-produce &quot;deserts&quot; in the inner city. But studies show their facts are wrong.

Poor urban neighborhoods have nearly twice as many supermarkets per square mile than wealthier ones, says a study published in the March issue of &quot;Social Science and Medicine.&quot; And according to a recent RAND study, urban neighborhoods are overrun with restaurants and grocers. They are, in the words of the author, &quot;food swamps,&quot; not deserts.

What&apos;s more, a 2007 Arbitron/Scarsborough survey found that it&apos;s a &quot;myth&quot; that &quot;black consumers don&apos;t buy groceries at mainstream stores&quot; or only eat out at fast-food joints like McDonald&apos;s.

In fact, African-Americans at all income levels &quot;shop at all grocery retailers&quot; — including Whole Foods — and also dine regularly at &quot;sit-down restaurants.&quot; But such data didn&apos;t stop HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan from complaining at a recent black conference that minorities have to take a bus &quot;just to find a fresh piece of fruit in a grocery store.&quot;

This echoes Michelle Obama&apos;s claim that millions of urban blacks live in areas bereft of fruits and vegetables, and are forced to consume Big Macs and junk food that cause obesity. She vows to eliminate these &quot;food deserts in America within seven years.&quot; Uh oh. Sounds like this administration actually believes supermarkets are redlining urban neighborhoods — just like they believe racist banks redline urban areas.

            <title>Washingtonians Can Blame EPA For Summer Pump Shock   4.20.12</title>
            <description>Energy Crisis: Vacationing White House and EPA officials will get a taste of their own medicine this summer when East Coast gas prices spike thanks in part to their restrictive policies.

Analysts are predicting a record spike in pump prices starting in June, with 50% of East Coast refinery capacity now shut down due in part to costly EPA regulations. And there&apos;s no quick way to resupply that lost gas via refineries in Louisiana and Texas, thanks to EPA restrictions on new pipelines.

Instead of blaming Wall Street &quot;speculators&quot; for the gas crisis, President Obama needs to call off his EPA regulators and make it easier for East Coast gas refiners to upgrade plants or build new ones, as well as for Gulf Coast suppliers to pipe in gas to the fuel-starved region.

The untold story behind soaring pump prices is that major U.S. refineries are going out of business and creating regional shortages. In just the past six months, three refineries — including two owned by Sunoco Inc. — supplying about half the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to the East Coast have closed. They say they simply cannot make money anymore.

            <title>The Obama Green Jobs Initiative Has Been A Failure    4.20.12</title>
            <description>Out Of Work: When they voted for Barack Obama in 2008, some Americans believed his promise of a green economy bursting with jobs. Some still do. Unfortunately, there&apos;s this little matter of reality.

While campaigning four years ago, Sen. Barack Obama promised that a $150 billion in government spending on renewable energy projects would create 5 million green-collar jobs over 10 years. Near the end of this administration&apos;s first year in office, Vice President Joe Biden promised 722,000 green jobs would be generated by the stimulus. A green-jobs czar was even appointed.

So what&apos;s happened?

Well, the jobless rate is still above 8% and the number of workers no longer in the labor force is nearly 88 million, up almost 10 million from the day this president entered the White House.

Obama could have boosted job growth by approving the Keystone XL pipeline and opening more federal tracts to oil and gas drilling. But he didn&apos;t. Instead he chose to stay on the green-collar route, which has yielded virtually nothing in the way of jobs.

            <title>New Culture Of Irresponsibility   4.19.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: What do the GSA spending scandal, the Secret Service sex scandal and Leon Panetta&apos;s expensive weekend trips home have in common? They stem from a culture of irresponsibility set by the man in the White House.

When President Obama came to Washington, he promised to usher in a &quot;new era of responsibility,&quot; one where everyone would recognize &quot;duties to ourselves, our nation and the world.&quot; But Obama has delivered the opposite.

He&apos;s used the presidency to lavish himself and his family with hugely expensive perks. He&apos;s used the Treasury as a piggy bank to reward donors and friends. He&apos;s blurred the line between campaign trips and presidential business. And let&apos;s not forget the fact that he&apos;s driving the country towards a financial cliff.

Since taking office, for example, the Obamas have jetted off on 16 vacations, with one — their 2011 Christmas vacation in Hawaii — costing taxpayers more than $1.5 million. His daughter&apos;s spring break in Mexico required a massive protection detail.

Just for kicks, Obama flew himself and British Prime Minister David Cameron to Ohio for an NCAA basketball game, at a cost of $365,000.

When a local TV reporter grilled Obama about his vacationing ways, he airily dismissed the complaint. &quot;I&apos;m raising a family here,&quot; he said, and besides, &quot;most folks understand how hard I work.&quot;

            <itunes:summary>Leadership: What do the GSA spending scandal, the Secret Service sex scandal and Leon Panetta&apos;s expensive weekend trips home have in common? They stem from a culture of irresponsibility set by the man in the White House.

When President Obama came to Washington, he promised to usher in a &quot;new era of responsibility,&quot; one where everyone would recognize &quot;duties to ourselves, our nation and the world.&quot; But Obama has delivered the opposite.

He&apos;s used the presidency to lavish himself and his family with hugely expensive perks. He&apos;s used the Treasury as a piggy bank to reward donors and friends. He&apos;s blurred the line between campaign trips and presidential business. And let&apos;s not forget the fact that he&apos;s driving the country towards a financial cliff.

Since taking office, for example, the Obamas have jetted off on 16 vacations, with one — their 2011 Christmas vacation in Hawaii — costing taxpayers more than $1.5 million. His daughter&apos;s spring break in Mexico required a massive protection detail.

Just for kicks, Obama flew himself and British Prime Minister David Cameron to Ohio for an NCAA basketball game, at a cost of $365,000.

When a local TV reporter grilled Obama about his vacationing ways, he airily dismissed the complaint. &quot;I&apos;m raising a family here,&quot; he said, and besides, &quot;most folks understand how hard I work.&quot;

            <title>Mitt Romney Will Push Elmination Of Some Departments   4.19.12</title>
            <description>Campaign: Mitt Romney has often been caricatured as a &quot;plain vanilla&quot; corporate hack lacking in imagination in his economic thinking. But in recent weeks, as he&apos;s fleshed out his policies, Americans see a far bolder vision.

In recent remarks, the GOP&apos;s presumed nominee surprised many by saying that he would eliminate or consolidate several federal Cabinet-level agencies to slash spending.

That includes two formerly sacred cows: the Departments of Education and of Housing and Urban Development, which together this year will spend $155 billion.

&quot;I&apos;m going to take a lot of departments in Washington, and agencies, and combine them,&quot; NBC News quotes Romney saying. &quot;Some eliminate, but I&apos;m probably not going to lay out just exactly which ones are going to go.&quot;

He did hint that HUD &quot;might not be around later&quot; and vowed he would &quot;consolidate&quot; Education or &quot; make it a heck of a lot smaller.&quot;

This is bold — bolder even than President Reagan, in some respects. It would not only slow spending, but also shrink the size of government, making it less intrusive and smothering — the kind of limited government envisioned in the Constitution.

The wailing and whining should start shortly. Democrats will call Romney heartless, a tool of the 1%. But the case for eliminating both agencies is powerful.

            <title>Investigate Nugent But Not Farrakhan?   4.19.12</title>
            <description>Gun Rights: The Secret Service wants to talk to an iconic rocker about metaphorical references to a movie while the administration ignores genuine threats of violence.

When Ted Nugent addressed the annual convention of the National Rifle Association, he used words no more strident than when, at a June 2008 Philadelphia fundraiser, candidate Barack Obama told of how he would respond to Republican attacks. &quot;If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun,&quot; said the former community organizer familiar with the street gangs of Chicago.

Attempting to rally fellow NRA members already agitated by the administration&apos;s push for gun control and its disregard for life and law in Operation Fast and Furious, Nugent told fellow Second Amendment devotees that &quot;we are patriots, we are &apos;Braveheart.&apos;&quot; He also said, &quot;We need to ride into that battlefield and chop their heads off in November.&quot;

We need to remind the administration and the Secret Service that &quot;Braveheart&quot; is only a movie and that Nugent is no more likely to ride a horse down Pennsylvania Avenue wielding a medieval battle-ax than Obama was to bring a handgun to the first presidential debate.

Nugent agreed to talk to the Secret Service about his remarks, some of which are crude but still no worse than those being uttered in living rooms across America. &quot;Our president and attorney general, our vice president, Hillary Clinton — they&apos;re criminals,&quot; Nugent said, an opinion we thought was protected by the First Amendment.

            <title>Reagan&apos;s Vital Lesson On Reducing Gas Prices Worked   4.19.12</title>
            <description>Energy: It wasn&apos;t anything mysterious that allowed Ronald Reagan to bring gasoline prices down so far, so fast. It was something we could use a commitment to in the executive branch today: economic freedom.

Skyrocketing gas and heating oil prices were the most infuriating development associated with what was mistakenly called the &quot;energy crisis&quot; during the 1970s. Mighty America, it seemed, had lost grasp of world events and the global economy.

It was understandable that presidential leadership in the world would slip badly during Watergate and Vietnam, but when a new Democratic president untainted by war or massive scandal was placed in the driver&apos;s seat in the latter half of the decade, what could explain his failure to rein in the price of oil?

Oil, which was about $20 a barrel in constant dollars at the beginning of the decade, exceeded $100 by 1980. The man the American people had elected to be leader of the free world put his incompetence in a nutshell in his May 24, 1979, diary entry:

            <description>Election 2012: President Obama&apos;s campaign has come out swinging against Mitt Romney with a list of negatives about the presumptive GOP nod. But they pale next to the incumbent&apos;s.

The Obama-Biden campaign has released via its website the &quot;5 Things You Need To Know About Mitt Romney.&quot;

It thinks they will scare Americans into not voting for him. Here they are:

&quot;1. He&apos;d repeal ObamaCare and take away health care for millions.&quot;

&quot;2. He opposes the president&apos;s plan to end the war in Afghanistan and would leave troops there indefinitely.&quot;

&quot;3. He&apos;d cut taxes for millionaires, paid for by cutting the programs that middle-class families rely on.&quot;

&quot;4. He&apos;d end Medicare as we know it.&quot;

&quot;5. He&apos;d get rid of Planned Parenthood and outlaw abortion.&quot;

            <title>Pain At The Pump And Pain At The Checkout Line    4.18.12</title>
            <description>Energy: The effect of restricting domestic oil production isn&apos;t limited to gas prices. Petroleum is used to make or move everything we buy. So a higher price amounts to an unconscionable tax on middle and working classes.

Pump prices are now more than $2 higher than they were when President Obama took office. For a middle-class family that fills up, say, two cars with 15-gallon gas tanks each week, that amounts to an extra $3,100 a year — no small expense.

But it&apos;s not just the price of filling up the family cars that&apos;s getting harder to afford. From the clothes on your back to the shoes on your feet to that backpack for junior, rising oil prices made worse by restricted domestic supply have affected the cost of far more things than we realize.

When the railroads and trucks that deliver food to the supermarket pay more for diesel fuel, the added cost shows up when you pay for your groceries at checkout. Look in your closet and you&apos;ll find clothing made from petroleum-based fibers, including rayon, nylon and polyester. Look beneath your feet and you&apos;ll see petroleum-based carpeting and flooring.

Petroleum is used in agriculture to make fertilizers and pesticides, to run the tractors, threshers and other farm equipment used to raise our food. That food must also be transported via fossil fuel-consuming trucks and trains.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Falklands Neutrality A Slap In The Face To U.K.   4.18.12</title>
            <description>Special Relationship: As Argentina marshals diplomatic support for its claim on Britain&apos;s Falklands Islands, the best President Obama can declare in response is U.S. &quot;neutrality.&quot; It&apos;s an insult to our top ally — and trouble for us.

One can only wonder what an irresponsible Evita Peron wannabe like Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner must think when she sees the shabby way President Obama treats America&apos;s leading ally, the United Kingdom.

At the weekend&apos;s Summit of the Americas, President Obama reiterated U.S. &quot;neutrality&quot; toward Argentina&apos;s claim to the Falkland Islands, the Atlantic islands under the British flag for 180 years, and the site of a 1982 war where Britain had to defend them from Argentina. At the time, the U.S. and Chile provided key help.

Obama&apos;s neutrality wasn&apos;t even that, though.

At the summit he attempted to use the Argentine term Malvinas, but mangled the term to &quot;Maldives.&quot;

Not only does that show contempt for the U.S. &quot;special relationship&quot; with Britain, it bodes ill for the future.

Obama&apos;s failure to show U.S. leadership in the region, along with his decision to limit U.S. oil output, are triggering aggressive moves to energy resources.

Argentina under Fernandez is a fresh new troublemaker acting up badly on energy issues, this week seizing Spanish oil company Repsol-YPF to whip up nationalist sentiment and distract from her own mismanagement — the same causes of the 1982 Falklands invasion.

            <title>Obama Doubles Down On More Solyndras   4.18.12</title>
            <description>Green Energy: Another day and another set of layoffs at a Department of Energy-backed solar company and an electric-car maker funded with stimulus dollars. Yet the President wants to double down on green energy.

First Solar, a solar energy company that received a $1.46 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, announced Monday it will lay off 2,000 workers worldwide. In December, First Solar laid off 100 employees at a Santa Clara , Calif., plant.

The DOE has committed the loan to a project in Riverside County, Calif., expected to create a whopping 15 permanent jobs and 550 construction jobs.

Contrast this boondoggle with the privately funded Keystone XL pipeline, delayed by President Obama over alleged environmental concerns, which would create 20,000 jobs initially and perhaps 10 times that over the life of the project. It will bring 800,000 barrels of oil daily to U.S. refineries, whether the sun shines or not.

Last Friday, Delaware Online reports, 12 more workers — including engineers and maintenance technicians — were laid off at Fisker Automotive&apos;s plant in Wilmington, Del., an old General Motors facility.

Originally Fisker was to build its $107,850 dream car, the electric Fisker Karma, there. The Karma, which Consumer Reports labeled &quot;undrivable&quot; after it had to be towed away after a test drive, is being built by Valmet in Finland. Fisker Automotive is the recipient of a $529 million federal government loan guarantee.

            <itunes:summary>Green Energy: Another day and another set of layoffs at a Department of Energy-backed solar company and an electric-car maker funded with stimulus dollars. Yet the President wants to double down on green energy.

First Solar, a solar energy company that received a $1.46 billion loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, announced Monday it will lay off 2,000 workers worldwide. In December, First Solar laid off 100 employees at a Santa Clara , Calif., plant.

The DOE has committed the loan to a project in Riverside County, Calif., expected to create a whopping 15 permanent jobs and 550 construction jobs.

Contrast this boondoggle with the privately funded Keystone XL pipeline, delayed by President Obama over alleged environmental concerns, which would create 20,000 jobs initially and perhaps 10 times that over the life of the project. It will bring 800,000 barrels of oil daily to U.S. refineries, whether the sun shines or not.

            <title>5 Trillion Reasons Democrats Should Produce a Budget   4.18.12</title>
            <description>Budget: Senate Democrats this week decided that, after digging the nation $5 trillion deeper in debt, producing a budget plan to get us out would be just too darn hard. It&apos;s time for new leadership.

&apos;This is the wrong time to vote in the committee,&quot; Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad said this week in an attempt to explain why Senate Democrats would once again fail to produce a budget. &quot;This is the wrong time to vote on the floor.&quot;

Give Conrad credit for a little honesty at least.

Since President Obama entered the White House in 2009, the Democrats have managed to sink the country $5 trillion deeper in debt.

The national debt now exceeds the entire U.S. economy, and unless Congress manages to reform entitlements and control spending, it&apos;ll only get worse.

Any wonder Democrats think it&apos;s the wrong time to tell us how they&apos;d get out of this mess? Either they&apos;d have to get serious about spending cuts and entitlement reform — which they&apos;ve refused to do — or they&apos;d have to propose massive tax hikes on everyone.

Worse still, they&apos;d have to cast votes announcing to the world where they stand on these choices. Who needs the hassle?

            <title>IRS Might Have Stalinist Powers Under New Law   4.17.12</title>
            <description>Liberty: The Republican House of Representatives may soon follow the Democratic Senate and give the IRS the power to confiscate your passport on mere suspicion of owing taxes. There&apos;s no place like home, comrade.

&apos;America, Love It Or Leave It&quot; might be an obsolete slogan if the &quot;bipartisan transportation bill&quot; that just passed the Senate is approved by the House and becomes law. Contained within the suspiciously titled &quot;Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act,&quot; or &quot;MAP 21,&quot; is a provision that gives the Internal Revenue Service the power to keep U.S. citizens from leaving the country if it finds that they owe $50,000 or more in unpaid taxes — no court ruling necessary.

It is hard to imagine any law more reminiscent of the Soviet Union that America toppled, or its Eastern Bloc slave satellites.

In his 1967 CBS &quot;Town Meeting of the World&quot; debate with Bobby Kennedy, Ronald Reagan declared, &quot;we don&apos;t want the Berlin Wall knocked down so that it&apos;s easier to get at the throats of the East Germans. We just think that a wall that is put up to confine people, and keep them within their own country instead of allowing them the freedom of world travel, has to be somehow wrong.&quot;

Throughout the many decades of the 20th century&apos;s Cold War, the freedom of movement Americans enjoyed as a cherished right was one of our secret weapons. As the Communists in Moscow promised the world utopia out of the barrel of a gun, people around the globe noticed that the Soviets needed walls and barbed wire fences to keep their people in, while in the U.S. walls were as pointless as a fish&apos;s bicycle.

            <title>Calif. Ruling On Breaks   4.17.12</title>
            <description>California: Should employers have to force workers to take breaks? The high court says no, advancing common sense and balanced regulation in a state with too little of either.

Talk to a business owner in the Golden State and you&apos;re likely to hear a lot about regulation and one category of regulation in particular: California&apos;s strict body of rules on hours and pay. No state quite matches it in the art of tying employers&apos; hands.

In that context, it was refreshing this past week to see the state Supreme Court ruling unanimously that employers do not have to force workers to take the breaks to which they&apos;re entitled. Employees still are due their time off during the workday, but the boss doesn&apos;t have to play Big Brother.

As Associate Justice Kathryn Werdegar said in writing for the court: &quot;The employer is not obligated to police meal breaks and ensure no work thereafter is performed.&quot;

The court is to be saluted for establishing a beachhead of common sense. That said, California still has a long way to go. The court case that gave rise to last week&apos;s ruling, an action brought by employees of the restaurant firm Brinker International Inc., is still alive. And the state&apos;s rules, particularly on overtime, are still overly rigid.

According to the U.S. Department of Labor, California and Nevada are the only states requiring time-and-half pay on any given day when an employee works past eight hours. The federal rule, followed by most states, is that overtime pay kicks in only after 40 hours have been worked in a seven-day period.

            <title>White House Stunned By Argentine Oil Expropriation   4.17.12</title>
            <description>Diplomacy: After a weekend of cavorting in Colombia, the White House was caught flat-footed by Argentina&apos;s takeover of a big oil company whose loss will hike gas prices, harm Spain and slam U.S. investors. Lucky us.

Never was a response to a global outrage more mealy-mouthed than the one from the U.S. after Argentina&apos;s President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, standing under a portrait of Evita Peron, announced a brazen grab for YPF, the Argentine oil company that&apos;s 57% owned by Spain&apos;s Repsol.

Markets fell, world leaders denounced the violation of contracts and economically battered Spain rallied European Union support.

But the U.S.? &quot;We are following developments on this issue. We are not currently aware of any WTO complaints related to this issue,&quot; the State Department said.

Then, leading from behind after Spain vowed a &quot;forceful&quot; response, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to toughen up: &quot;Having an open market is a preferable model. Models that include competition and market access have been the most successful around the world.&quot;

            <title>Obama&apos;s Crackdown On Speculators Won&apos;t Cut Prices  4.17.12</title>
            <description>Energy: President Obama&apos;s promised &quot;crackdown&quot; on speculators is another example of his using government to strangle markets and increase control over the private economy. Worse, it won&apos;t cut gas prices one bit.

President Obama knows that soaring gasoline prices are hurting his political chances in November. How else to explain his sudden decision to go after &quot;speculators&quot; — that is, investors — in the oil and gasoline markets for driving up prices?

Under his watch, gasoline prices have soared from $1.89 a gallon to nearly $3.90 a gallon — a 106% rise in just three years. No wonder he&apos;s in a political panic.

Standing with Attorney General Eric Holder, President Obama said Tuesday he wants to put &quot;more cops on the street&quot; to nab speculators who profit from rising oil prices. Cops? For people investing legally?

After ripping Congress for not imposing new taxes on oil companies, as he wanted, Obama on Tuesday called on lawmakers to spend $52 million to give bureaucrats expansive new controls over oil trading markets.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Overseas Travel Turning Into Campaign Stops  4.16.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: President Obama&apos;s defenders complain his overseas trips seem jinxed by distractions, as this weekend&apos;s Summit of the Americas was. But as presidential travels become campaign stops, shenanigans happen.

The president criticized media coverage of his visit to the Sixth Annual Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, for its focus on tawdry distractions, including the scandal of Secret Service employees who were sent home early for allegedly consorting with prostitutes while staying at taxpayer expense at a five-star beachside hotel.

The criticism may seem reasonable, given the importance of the diplomatic mission. But the specter of Secret Service men cavorting Spring Break-style is the sort of antic that takes place on campaign trails, which is the tone President Obama set for this official visit.

This trip wasn&apos;t about diplomacy, or taking a stand for democracy or encouraging American values. The president mouthed cautious, standard U.S. stances on Cuba, drugs and free trade, but did so with little conviction.

Instead, he was really focused on winning votes back home as campaign season kicks in. Acts that can only be justified in a campaign rather than diplomatic context formed a pretty long list at this summit:

            <title>Donor Cash For White House Access    4.16.12</title>
            <description>Corruption: A new study documents that access to the White House is based on how much money is put into the president&apos;s campaign coffers. At least the Lincoln Bedroom isn&apos;t for rent — yet.

During the Clinton administration, when the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House became a favorite place for campaign contributors to rest their weary wallets, the infamous Johnny Chung made the observation that the White House was like a subway turnstile: You put your token in and you got inside.

An analysis of White House access by the New York Times suggests that hope and change has changed nothing except maybe you don&apos;t get to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom. But in exchange for enriching the president&apos;s campaign coffers, you do get to bend the president&apos;s ear with a frequency greater than heads of state and Cabinet members.

&quot;Among donors who gave $30,000 or less, about 20% visited the White House,&quot; according to the Times analysis written by Mike McIntire and Michael Luo in the paper&apos;s April 15 edition. The analysis matched names in the visitor logs with donor records. &quot;But among those who donated $100,000 or more, the figure rises to 75%,&quot; write McIntire and Luo.

Clearly, President Obama&apos;s much ballyhooed ban on lobbyist contributions has not prevented lobbyists and other representatives of special interests from visiting the White House frequently. Some of those who sought access, and quid for their quo, were quite open about it.

            <title>Next They&apos;ll Say We Have Too Many Polar Bears   4.16.12</title>
            <description>Alarmism: Among the problems caused by climate change, we&apos;ve been told, is its grave threat to polar bears. Earthjustice, for one, says the animals &quot;are facing unprecedented threats&quot; from global warming. Well, not exactly.

Eight years ago, Environment Canada estimated that by 2011, the polar bear population on the western shore of the Hudson Bay region would fall to about 610.

Last year, the World Wildlife Fund screamed in a headline in its climate blog: &quot;Polar Bear Population In Canada&apos;s Western Hudson Bay Unlikely To Survive Climate Disruption.&quot;

And in the summer of 2010, the U.K. Independent reported on fear &quot;that the bears could die out in 25 to 30 years, or perhaps in as few as 10.&quot;

Really, the rumors of their extinction have been greatly exaggerated. A new survey by the Nunavut Territory government has found that the polar bear population along the western shore of the Hudson Bay is increasing. The study found 1,013 of them in the region, far more than the 610 the alarmists projected.

In fact, there could be as many as 1,430. Or as few as 717. The 1,013 is in the middle of the range that spans from 717 to 1,430.

            <title>Dropping Fossil Fuels For Green Energy Would Be Foolish   4.16.12</title>
            <description>Energy: Barack Obama has been promising a green future since before he was president. While we might one day be powered by renewable energy, there&apos;s no reason to rush it. Fossil fuels are still abundant, reliable and cheap.

Roughly 85% of our domestic energy is provided by fossil fuels. They generate more than 96% of the energy used in transportation and about 67% of the electricity we consume.

Despite promises and commands from the Obama administration — the president pledged in 2009 to cut oil consumption 35% by 2030, for instance — these ratios aren&apos;t going to change much in coming decades.

The International Energy Agency, based in Paris — not Paris, Texas — predicted in November 2008 that from until 2030, fossil fuels will account for almost 80% of the increased global energy demand.

Oil, said the IEA, will remain the single-largest fuel source, while demand for coal will grow 61% during the period, its share of total energy demand expanding from 26% to 29%.

            <title>ObamaCare Vs. LeninCare: U.S. Copies Soviets  4.13.12</title>
            <description>The Obama Record: When Vladimir I. Lenin sought to remake Russian society into a &quot;proletariats&apos; paradise,&quot; he targeted three sectors for control: health care, banking and education. Sound familiar?

Of these three, however, Lenin viewed socialized medicine as the &quot;keystone&quot; to building his socialist utopia.

The Bolshevik leader told the Russian people everybody would be able to afford going to the doctor, not just the &quot;greedy rich.&quot; He also claimed centralized control of the medical industry would &quot;reduce costs&quot; and end the &quot;waste&quot; from &quot;unnecessary duplication and parallelism&quot; in a competitive market.

In 1918, the USSR became the first nation to promise &quot;free&quot; universal health-care coverage. Fifteen years later, major flaws appeared in its grand social experiment, even to Western observers who for the most part romanticized it.

&quot;Monetary motives have almost entirely ceased to operate in medical practice in Soviet Russia,&quot; observed a pair of sympathetic physicians from America and Britain who traveled to Russia in 1933.

As a result, &quot;there still exists a great shortage of physicians and hospitals,&quot; they wrote in their report, &quot;Red Medicine: Socialized Health in Soviet Russia.&quot; &quot;Drugs are almost fabulously dear and scarce.&quot;

            <title>Welch Hits Finger-Pointer In Chief   4.13.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: A business icon has ripped the administration&apos;s &quot;divide and conquer&quot; strategy, the president&apos;s refusal to take responsibility for his policies and for an enemies list that would make a disgraced ex-president proud.

We now have the Obama Principle. It&apos;s like the Peter Principle, in which people rise to the level of their incompetence, except as redefined by this administration you refuse to recognize your incompetence and constantly blame others when things go wrong.

Jack Welch, renowned former CEO of General Electric before it became the nontaxpaying sock puppet for the administration&apos;s green energy push, has penned an Op-Ed article for Reuters in which he says Obama&apos;s &quot;divide-and-conquer&quot; re-election strategy is unworthy of a great leader and chides the president for blaming others for our economic woes.

&quot;Over the past three years,&quot; Welch wrote last Wednesday, &quot;Obama has taken a sort of divide-and-conquer approach, amassing a list of enemies that would make Richard Nixon proud — bankers, health care insurance providers, oil companies, wealthy taxpayers, Congress and, most recently, the Supreme Court.

&quot;Gas prices are the fault of oil speculators. The failure of solar power companies is the fault of unfair Chinese competition. The bad economy is one of the many things he inherited, as is the deficit. Operation Fast and Furious was a program begun under the Bush administration that he knew nothing about. The deficit is skyrocketing because the rich aren&apos;t paying their &apos;fair share.&apos;&quot;

            <title>Ann Romney — Latest Target In Democrats&apos; War On Moms    4.12.12</title>
            <description>Bias: While her party supports taxpayer-funded contraceptives for female law students, a top Democrat disses a stay-at-home mother of five who has &quot;never worked a day in her life.&quot; She&apos;s the probable GOP nominee&apos;s wife.

The Democrats think Sandra Fluke, a Georgetown law student who wants unwilling taxpayers and religious groups to provide her with $3,000 worth of contraceptives, is worthy of support and praise.

Meanwhile, Ann Romney, a mother of five, is condemned because she &quot;has actually never worked a day in her life,&quot; as Democrat strategist Hilary Rosen put it.

We would suggest it is the Democrats who have a problem with women — not Republicans.

Rosen, talking with CNN&apos;s Anderson Cooper about the &quot;war on women,&quot; went off on GOP front-runner Mitt Romney&apos;s comment that he listens to his wife on women&apos;s issues.

&quot;What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country saying, &apos;Well, you know my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues,&apos;&quot; Rosen opined, &quot;and when I listen to my wife, that&apos;s what I&apos;m hearing.&apos; Guess what? His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.&quot;

Rosen scoffed at the notion that a stay-at-home mom of five and grandmother of 16, who also happens to be battling MS and has survived cancer, has any insight into the concerns of women in America: &quot;I made a choice to stay at home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was a hard choice,&quot; Ann Romney tweeted in response.

            <title>Iran Nuclear Talks One-Up Chamberlain In Naivete   4.12.12</title>
            <description>Nuclear Terror: The ayatollah&apos;s representatives come to Istanbul&apos;s nuclear talks on Saturday with &quot;new initiatives&quot; for Western diplomats. Even Neville Chamberlain could see through this years-long charade.

&apos;This morning I had another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine.&quot;

Those words, spoken by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after returning from Munich in 1938, are forever synonymous with the appeasement of evil.

Today, the U.S., led by Barack Obama, and our European partners seem eager to practice the very same lethal naivete against nuclear Islamofascism.

Going into still more nuclear talks with Tehran on Saturday, the speculation is that American and European diplomats seek a deal to limit Iran&apos;s ability to enrich weapons-grade uranium. But this may well amount to closing the reactor door after the horse has bolted.

In February, Israeli military intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi said Iran already has enough uranium to make four nuclear weapons. A nuclear bomb, he said, is just another year or two away.

As always, Iran suggests it&apos;s sincere, but isn&apos;t. Tehran&apos;s top negotiator Saeed Jalili promises the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China, and Germany &quot;new initiatives ... and we hope the other side will do the same.&quot;

            <itunes:subtitle>Nuclear Terror: The ayatollah&apos;s representatives come to Istanbul&apos;s nuclear talks on Saturday with &quot;new initiatives&quot; for Western diplomats.</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Nuclear Terror: The ayatollah&apos;s representatives come to Istanbul&apos;s nuclear talks on Saturday with &quot;new initiatives&quot; for Western diplomats. Even Neville Chamberlain could see through this years-long charade.

&apos;This morning I had another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler, and here is the paper which bears his name upon it as well as mine.&quot;

Those words, spoken by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after returning from Munich in 1938, are forever synonymous with the appeasement of evil.

Today, the U.S., led by Barack Obama, and our European partners seem eager to practice the very same lethal naivete against nuclear Islamofascism.

Going into still more nuclear talks with Tehran on Saturday, the speculation is that American and European diplomats seek a deal to limit Iran&apos;s ability to enrich weapons-grade uranium. But this may well amount to closing the reactor door after the horse has bolted.

In February, Israeli military intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi said Iran already has enough uranium to make four nuclear weapons. A nuclear bomb, he said, is just another year or two away.

As always, Iran suggests it&apos;s sincere, but isn&apos;t. Tehran&apos;s top negotiator Saeed Jalili promises the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, China, and Germany &quot;new initiatives ... and we hope the other side will do the same.&quot;</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama Peddles Myths About High Gas Prices   4.12.12</title>
            <description>Energy: To hear President Obama talk about energy, you&apos;d think annual oil price spikes were routine and predictable. But it&apos;s another energy myth Obama peddles to avoid responsibility for high gas prices.

In February, Obama lamented these &quot;gas price spikes that happen every year.&quot; A few days later, he talked about the need to &quot;take control of our energy future&quot; so we could &quot;avoid high gas prices every single year.&quot;

&quot;This is not the first time we&apos;ve seen gas prices spike,&quot; he said in yet another speech. &quot;It&apos;s been happening for years. Every year, about this time, gas starts spiking up and everybody starts wondering, how high is it going to go?&quot;

And in yet another talk, he described it as &quot;this cycle of high gas prices that happens year after year after year.&quot;

For Obama, this is a convenient excuse. After all, price spikes can&apos;t possibly be his fault, since they happen &quot;year after year.&quot;

Instead, he says, they&apos;re the fault of a 30-year failure to adopt a national energy policy that gets the country off oil.

            <title>Obama Gets A Pass From States With Priciest Gas   4.12.12</title>
            <description>Energy Politics: States that look like safe bets for Barack Obama this November also have some of the nation&apos;s highest gasoline prices at the pump. Maybe it&apos;s all part of feeling green.

Do liberal voters actually like shelling out four bucks or more for regular? It almost seems that way looking at gasoline prices across the U.S.

With a few exceptions, the cheapest gas is to be found in some of the most solidly Republican states, like Wyoming, Oklahoma and Utah. The highest prices are almost all in states that look to be safely in President Obama&apos;s corner.

If pain at the pump is a liability for an incumbent, then Obama must be leading a charmed life. Blue-staters paying more for gas may or may not be loving it, but they&apos;re not hating Obama over it.

As the San Francisco Chronicle has noted, &quot;Obama&apos;s electoral map to victory bears a remarkable resemblance to a map of the nation&apos;s highest gas prices.&quot;

This story looks less ironic the more you dig into it.

First, on the strictly economic level, per-gallon prices are not that precise a way to measure the real cost of driving. In day-to-day living, rural drivers have to cover more miles than the typical urbanite, and they are likely to be driving pickups, not Priuses.

            <title>Allen West Ends Myth Progressives Aren&apos;t Extreme   4.12.12</title>
            <description>Politics: The left had a fit of the vapors after GOP Rep. Allen West of Florida insinuated that there were boatloads of communists in Congress among Democrats. Well, maybe not, but where there&apos;s smoke, there&apos;s fire.

Speaking before a town hall in Jensen Beach, Fla., the popular congressman said: &quot;I believe there&apos;s about 78 to 81 members of the Democratic Party that are members of the communist party.&quot;

A staffer later explained that he was referring to the far-left congressional Progressive Caucus, all of whose members have truly radical pasts.

West&apos;s statement ignited a firestorm. How dare he suggest that any of us could possibly be communist?

&quot;Calling fellow members of Congress &apos;communists&apos; is reminiscent of the days when Joe McCarthy divided Americans with name-calling and modern-day witch hunts,&quot; huffed the congressional Progressive Caucus.

            <title>Restricting Supply To Boost Prices    4.9.12</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: The administration claims there&apos;s no &quot;silver bullet&quot; to lower gas prices and that they&apos;ve kept rising in the face of higher domestic production, as if the law of supply and demand has suddenly been repealed.

It hasn&apos;t, and increased production on private and state lands doesn&apos;t blunt the impact on prices when 94% of federal onshore lands and 97% of federal offshore lands are off-limits to oil and gas drilling.

A key factor in gas prices is and always has been future supplies and potential disruptions to those supplies.

Another is the fact that we are the only major nation to deliberately limit domestic oil production even as war clouds and unstable governments place foreign sources in jeopardy.

We saw the effect of supply on oil and gas prices when oil prices fell by $2 a barrel overnight on a mere rumor that the U.S. and Britain might jointly tap their reserves.

On Monday, oil prices fell 2% as revived talks on Iran&apos;s nuclear program eased fears of supply disruptions. Imagine the effect on oil and gas prices tomorrow if President Obama opened all federal lands and our vast reserves to oil and gas drilling.

            <title>Slow Jobs Growth Underscores Obamanomics&apos; Failure   4.9.12</title>
            <description>Economy: Darin Wedel, an out-of-work Texas electronics engineer who more than two months ago sent his resume to the White House at the request of President Obama, is still unemployed. It&apos;s a tale for our times.

Wedel sent his resume to the White House after Obama told Wedel&apos;s wife in a Jan. 30 Internet forum that the U.S. doesn&apos;t have enough home-grown engineers to fill all the opportunities.

Turns out, that&apos;s not exactly true. &quot;Not even recruiting companies are calling anymore,&quot; Jennifer Wedel, a Fort Worth, Texas, mother of two, said of her jobless hubby.

As the Wedel family might tell you — and as April&apos;s mediocre gain of 120,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs shows — the economy&apos;s employment engine isn&apos;t in high gear.

Numbers tell the story. Since Obama entered office promising a jobs boom from his &quot;stimulus,&quot; the economy has lost 1.6 million jobs. Since the employment peak in early 2008, 5.2 million jobs have disappeared.

            <title>Army Of IRS Enforcers Can&apos;t Make ObamaCare Legitimate   4.9.12</title>
            <description>Big Gov&apos;t: After foisting its 2,700-page health law on the public, the White House now plans to enforce its detested mandate by siccing the IRS on unwilling citizens. All that stands in the way is &quot;the consent of the governed.&quot;

Back in 2009, when ObamaCare was being debated in Congress, then-House Minority Leader John Boehner warned that the takeover of the health care system could only lead to armies of enforcers from the Internal Revenue Service forcing Americans to buy insurance of the government&apos;s choosing.

Boehner recognized that this so-called reform would inevitably trigger major public resistance.

Boehner was mocked as an alarmist by Obama&apos;s Democratic allies. But in reality, he was right, and nobody knew it better than the Obama administration itself.

That&apos;s why the behemoth ObamaCare bill sneakily left out the detail that it intended to hire 500 Internal Revenue Service agents to enforce the unpopular mandate, while 300 other IRS operatives would be added to push &quot;free&quot; benefits to the indigent to ensure their complete dependence on the state.

Cost: Half a billion dollars, paid for off-the-books by taxpayers through a massive $1 billion Health and Human Services slush fund that got tucked into the bill.

            <title>Obama &quot;Charisma&quot; No Match For North Korean Duplicity  4.9.12</title>
            <description>Totalitarianism: Less than two months ago U.S. diplomacy seemingly performed a miracle, taming Pyongyang&apos;s new, youthful dictator in exchange for food. Unsurprisingly, the regime is back to its old tricks, and then some.

North Korea is giving South Korea, Japan and the U.S. a major attack of nerves with a multi-stage ballistic missile test this week that the totalitarian regime pretends is the launch of a weather satellite. How its perennially undernourished populace will benefit from knowing the five-day forecast the Pyongyang government left unexplained.

As dozens of foreign media were taken by train to be shown the launch site, Pyongyang threatened &quot;merciless punishment&quot; against any power that intercepted its missile in flight. South Korea and Japan, meanwhile, placed their armed forces at a heightened state of readiness; in the Philippines, citizens were even advised to &quot;stay indoors&quot; for fears of falling debris.

A South Korean intelligence official told the country&apos;s Yonhap news agency that North Korea was digging a tunnel near the Chinese border in an area where nuclear bombs were tested in 2006 and 2009. South Korea state TV showed satellite images of freshly excavated dirt near the site of previous nuclear tests.

            <itunes:summary>Totalitarianism: Less than two months ago U.S. diplomacy seemingly performed a miracle, taming Pyongyang&apos;s new, youthful dictator in exchange for food. Unsurprisingly, the regime is back to its old tricks, and then some.

North Korea is giving South Korea, Japan and the U.S. a major attack of nerves with a multi-stage ballistic missile test this week that the totalitarian regime pretends is the launch of a weather satellite. How its perennially undernourished populace will benefit from knowing the five-day forecast the Pyongyang government left unexplained.

As dozens of foreign media were taken by train to be shown the launch site, Pyongyang threatened &quot;merciless punishment&quot; against any power that intercepted its missile in flight. South Korea and Japan, meanwhile, placed their armed forces at a heightened state of readiness; in the Philippines, citizens were even advised to &quot;stay indoors&quot; for fears of falling debris.

A South Korean intelligence official told the country&apos;s Yonhap news agency that North Korea was digging a tunnel near the Chinese border in an area where nuclear bombs were tested in 2006 and 2009. South Korea state TV showed satellite images of freshly excavated dirt near the site of previous nuclear tests.</itunes:summary>

            <title>AP Apes Obama Talking Points In Luncheon Introduction   4.4.12</title>
            <description>Media Bias: The charade ended long ago in regard to the dominant media&apos;s &quot;objectivity.&quot; Tuesday&apos;s love letter to President Obama from the chairman of the Associated Press just confirms the obvious.

The only thing separating AP Chairman and newspaper mogul Dean Singleton&apos;s gushing introduction of President Obama to an Associated Press luncheon in a fancy Washington hotel from an Obama 2012 campaign rally was the absence of the line, &quot;and now the next president of the United States.&quot;

You would never imagine Singleton was describing a president who in just over three years has added nearly $5 trillion to the national debt — more than twice that of the Bush administration&apos;s eight years.

Obama &quot;inherited the head winds of the worst economic recession since the Great Depression,&quot; according to Singleton. Translation: Blame Bush for Obama&apos;s 8.3% unemployment and debt nearing $16 trillion.

&quot;He pushed through Congress the biggest economic recovery plan in history,&quot; Singleton said — not &quot;he spent more than any president in history&quot; on a &quot;recovery plan&quot; that failed to bring recovery.

            <title>Higher Rates End Obama&apos;s Borrowing Cost Holiday   4.4.12</title>
            <description>Debt Crisis: Just when the president was getting some economic wind at his back, a bearish bond market is stoking interest rates and making it harder to finance the record debt he&apos;s racked up.

Minutes from the Federal Reserve&apos;s last meeting show the central bank has all but abandoned plans for another round of quantitative easing.

It&apos;s now clear the Fed is more worried about inflation than recession. The switch has effectively ended the long bull run in bonds and driven short-term interest rates higher.

Over the past couple months, bonds have sold off, and 10-year bond yields, which move opposite bond prices, have soared 30 basis points to 2.3%.

The benchmark 10-year note is key because it sets the financing rate for the federal debt, which has skyrocketed to a record $15.6 trillion on Obama&apos;s watch, a level that eclipses the entire U.S. gross domestic product.

The Treasury Department now fears Obama will lose the advantage of low borrowing costs that he&apos;s enjoyed while running up budget deficits.

Even though the national debt has more than doubled over the past four years, the government&apos;s interest payments have remained roughly the same thanks to virtually zero real borrowing costs. But Treasury analysts know this cheap money holiday won&apos;t last.

            <title>Court Tells Obama To Do His Judicial Review Homework   4.4.12</title>
            <description>Justice: A Fifth Circuit Court judge, not amused by presidential intimidation of the courts, tells the Justice Department to produce a three-page letter explaining the administration&apos;s position on judicial review of laws.

It wasn&apos;t an order to have President Obama write &quot;I will not question judicial review&quot; 500 times on the blackboard but the Fifth Circuit Court request for a &quot;specific&quot; explanation of the administration&apos;s position on whether courts can decide the constitutionality of laws is close enough.

The Fifth Circuit, which is hearing a case against ObamaCare brought by physician-owned hospitals, was not amused by the recent presidential questioning of both the judgment and the authority of the Supreme Court to determine the constitutionality of ObamaCare&apos;s insurance mandate.

During oral arguments on a related case, U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Jerry Smith told the government&apos;s lawyers that the president&apos;s remarks were troubling and demanded an explanation from DOJ lawyer Dana Lydia Kaersvang.

&quot;Does the Department of Justice,&quot; Judge Smith asked, &quot;recognize that federal courts have the authority in appropriate circumstances to strike federal statutes because of one or more constitutional infirmities?&quot;

            <title>Speculators A Convenient Whipping Boy For Political Acts That Drive Up Oil Prices    4.4.12</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: A group of liberal senators once again want to pass a law that would force the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to clamp down on oil speculators. Their ignorance of how markets work is breathtaking.

These senators, led by Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders, claim speculative evildoers control 80% of the oil market, and are to blame for rising gas prices. When lawmakers blame speculators, you can be sure they&apos;re covering for their own ineptitude.

Basically, the senators say that since supply is rising, and demand is at its lowest since 1997, the price of oil should be falling — not rising. That means speculators must be stealing billions from consumers.

But this is false — and more than a little bit silly.

Recent price hikes have a geopolitical cause. A good chunk of Iran&apos;s hefty supply has been taken off the market, tightening a delicate supply-demand balance. Refiners worry about a wider conflagration in the Mideast.

It&apos;s their job to secure oil and &quot;crack&quot; it into usable products, such as gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel. If you were them, wouldn&apos;t you buy extra oil, just in case?

Well, that&apos;s speculation. And if the price of oil goes up today, and you rush to the gas station to beat the higher price tomorrow — guess what? You too are a speculator.

            <description>Energy Policy: That gas prices are edging ever closer to $4 a gallon is bad enough. But even worse is the fact that the public blames the wrong villains. No wonder President Obama seems so unconcerned.

Last week&apos;s average price for regular gasoline hit $3.94 a gallon, according to the Dept. of Energy. That&apos;s up 11 cents in just three weeks, and more than $2 a gallon since Obama took office.

So who gets the blame? Obama for cutting oil production on federal lands and killing Keystone XL pipeline, for endlessly berating the industry and offhandedly dismissing oil as &quot;yesterday&apos;s fuel&quot;?

            <title>Yes, Virginia, President Obama Is An Oil Hypocrite   4.2.12</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: The Interior Department announces a five-year environmental study of offshore oil sites along the Atlantic coast with possible drilling off the Old Dominion in 2018 — only seven years after a promised lease sale.

Despite taking credit for rising oil production on private and state lands he has nothing to do with, and claiming he supports opening up areas for domestic exploration as part of his &quot;all-of-the-above&quot; energy policy, President Obama in fact despises domestic fossil fuel production and moves to block it at every opportunity.

During a visit to Norfolk, Va., last week, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Bureau of Ocean Energy Management director Tommy Beaudreau released a draft document for public comment on plans for oil exploration, drilling and possible lease sales off the Atlantic coast from Florida to New Jersey.

            <title>Poll Shows Even In Michigan Unions Are Despised   4.2.12</title>
            <description>Politics: A new poll shows that labor unions are detested in, of all places, Michigan. Maybe that has something to do with what they&apos;ve done to that state&apos;s economy and their effort to recall the governor who aims to reverse it.

It probably started with the U.S. taxpayer bailout of the auto industry. A September 2009 Gallup poll indicated that for the first time since it began asking the question in the 1930s, less than half of Americans — just 48% — approved of labor unions. The numbers have slid ever since, with a Pew poll in February 2011 showing only 41% had a favorable opinion of unions.

Now columnist Michael Barone has discovered yet another one from pollster Bill Ballenger of Inside Michigan Politics indicating that, in the very heart of bail out country, unions are absolute pariahs.

            <title>ObamaCare Is Bending The Cost Curve Upward    4.2.12</title>
            <description>Rising Costs: The president insisted — repeatedly — that his party&apos;s health care overhaul would roll back spending. Skeptics, of course, knew better. But we wonder how many realized just how costly the reform would be.

President Obama promised the Democrats&apos; health care legislation would both &quot;bend&quot; the health care cost curve downward and &quot;cut the deficit by a trillion dollars.&quot;

Critics said hogwash and pointed out that government programs, particularly signature initiatives, always cost far more than the bureaucracy projects. Despite promises that ObamaCare would be different, it turns out that it won&apos;t.

            <title>Obama Pits America’s Makers Against Its Takers   3.30.12</title>
            <description>The Obama Record: GOP White House contenders think the president is taking the country down the path to &quot;European socialism.&quot; They&apos;re wrong. It could be something much more radical.

Eight years ago, virtually out of nowhere, Barack Obama burst onto the national political scene. Few knew this young politician from Chicago, who was trained as a community organizer and civil-rights lawyer.

Fewer still knew of his carefully calculated plans for using the democratic process to gain power and bring about &quot;social change&quot; on a large scale.

But gain it he did. And now — after his keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and his 2008 presidential triumph — we&apos;ve had a chance to see how that &quot;change&quot; looks. Obama has unleashed a juggernaut of legislation and regulations on industry that rival the New Deal in scope.

            <title>Biden&apos;s Dumb, But Administration&apos;s Policies Are Dumber  3.30.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: A global tax is the latest example of the idiocy that defines Joseph Biden&apos;s vice presidency. Dopiness a heartbeat away from the presidency shouldn&apos;t be tolerated.

If Arnold Schwarzenegger is the Terminator, promising &quot;I&apos;ll be back,&quot; the best moniker for Joe Biden might be &quot;the Dumb-Biden-ator,&quot; with the motto &quot;I&apos;ll be stupid.&quot;

At a Davenport, Iowa, manufacturing plant last week, Biden declared &quot;We&apos;re not done&quot; of the Obama economic program that has saddled Americans with a $1.3 trillion deficit and $15 trillion national debt, with plenty more to come.

&quot;We want to create what&apos;s called a global minimum tax,&quot; he said, &quot;because American taxpayers shouldn&apos;t be providing a larger subsidy for investing abroad than investing at home.&quot;

According to the White House, this refers to all U.S. companies being subjected to a minimum tax on overseas profits, to prevent them from taking advantage of other countries&apos; low tax rates. President Obama&apos;s National Economic Council director Gene Sperling also used the term &quot;global minimum tax&quot; last month.

But considering this administration&apos;s hostility to American exceptionalism, for all we know U.S. businesses could find themselves a couple of years from now subject to taxation dictated by corrupt international bodies like the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. ObamaCare proves that you never can be sure what this president and his minions are really up to.

            <title>Obama Out Of Touch With World On Value Of Free-Market Economics   3.30.12</title>
            <description>Free Markets: &quot;You&apos;re-on-your-own economics&quot; doesn&apos;t work, President Obama asserted Friday, just as the World Bank reported a halving of world poverty due mainly to — you guessed it — you&apos;re-on-your-own economics.

If anything puts our president, the leader of the Free World, squarely outside the global mainstream, it&apos;s statements like the one he made to students at a University of Vermont fundraiser Friday:

&quot;The American story is not just about what we do on our own,&quot; the president said. &quot;We have always understood that we wouldn&apos;t win the race for new jobs and businesses and middle class security if we were just applying some you&apos;re-on-your-own economics. It&apos;s been tried in history and it hasn&apos;t worked. It didn&apos;t work when we tried it in the decade before the Great Depression. It didn&apos;t work when we tried it in the last decade.&quot;

Well, maybe he&apos;s never heard of the Roaring &apos;20s.

And perhaps he didn&apos;t try free-market economics himself in the past decade, but all six global regions observed by the World Bank did try it — and the stunning result is that global poverty has been slashed in half, and well ahead of the United Nations&apos; 2015 Millennium Challenge deadline.

That&apos;s right, global poverty has been slashed in half. It started with the advent of free markets in Chile in 1975, gained speed with the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions, took off with the Asian Tiger states and has been crescendo-ing around the globe ever since.

            <title>The Left Misreads Popularity Of Limbaugh, Tea Party   3.30.12</title>
            <description>Conservatism: The White House sicced its meanest attack dogs, Media Matters and MSNBC, on Rush Limbaugh. But they couldn&apos;t knock him off the air. Their advertising boycott has failed.

Even the Washington Post admits the conservative talk-show giant has survived a monthlong crusade to cow sponsors and stations into dropping Limbaugh over intemperate remarks he made about a coed fan of ObamaCare.

&quot;Stations are standing by him,&quot; the Post reported, and &quot;advertisers are trickling back to his program.&quot;

Turns out the ad losses were far fewer than liberal Media Matters claimed in a running tally on its website.

In fact, virtually all of Limbaugh&apos;s long-term sponsors stuck with the show, in spite of relentless brow-beating by both Media Matters and MSNBC, which also works closely with the White House.

Of the 180 stations that carry Limbaugh, only two dropped him. And both are based in deep blue states, Massachusetts and Hawaii. Even the Beltway&apos;s top AM station wasn&apos;t cowed by the left-wing assault.

            <title>The U.S. Is Now No. 1— In Corporate Tax Rates   3.30.12</title>
            <description>Taxes: As the president complains once again that oil companies are getting unfair tax breaks, the U.S. passes Japan as the leader in business taxes. Workers, investors and entrepreneurs will bear the cost.

On April 1, Japan will cut its corporate tax rate to 36.8% from 39.5%. This includes a 10% surtax that will expire in 2014. As it does, the U.S. will officially have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, with average combined federal and state profit levies of 39.2%. And, no, this is not an April Fools&apos; joke.

The news comes after President Obama once again said oil company profits justified ending $4 billion in &quot;subsidies&quot; and shifting the money to research on clean-energy fuels.

Except there&apos;s no money to shift since the $4 billion is simply money the government doesn&apos;t take in the first place under incentives available to all manufacturing companies, from Apple to President Obama&apos;s favorite company, General Electric.

Just as we are the only industrial country not fully developing its domestic energy resources, we are the only country not slashing its corporate taxes. Great Britain was to cut its corporate tax rate on April 1 to 24% from 26% and will cut the rate again to 23% in 2013.

On Jan. 1 of this year, Canada cut its federal corporate tax rate to 15% from 16.5%.

Canada&apos;s combined rate is 26% when the average rate of the Canadian provinces is added to the federal rate. Coupled with an unfettered energy development policy, Canada&apos;s tax policy creates a low-cost, business-friendly environment, unlike the America that Obama is fundamentally transforming into a socialist command-economy that tilts at windmills.

            <title>If The Court Dumps ObamaCare, Republicans Must Be Ready    3.29.12</title>
            <description>Health Reform: If the Supreme Court chucks ObamaCare entirely, which looks increasingly likely, Republicans will finally have a chance to redefine the debate. But only if they get educated and put together reform ideas now.

If the court rejects ObamaCare, Democratic strategist James Carville said this week, &quot;then the Republican Party will own the health care system for the foreseeable future.&quot; He meant it as a warning; in fact, it&apos;s a historic opportunity.

For too long, Democrats have defined the health care issue, depicting the U.S. system as an unfettered market where costs run wild, insurers rip off consumers and deny coverage to tens of millions, and big-government &quot;reforms&quot; are desperately needed. None of it is true.

            <title>Pope&apos;s Cuba Visit May Prove Subversive To Castro    3.29.12</title>
            <description>Diplomacy: Pope Benedict XVI drew some criticism on his trip to Cuba for insufficiently challenging that odious, repressive and godless regime. But his quiet message calling for truth-telling and liberty was highly subversive.

Arriving for a three-day visit to the longest, blackest tyranny the hemisphere has ever known, the pontiff followed in the footsteps of Pope John Paul II, who in Havana in 1998 offered the first Catholic mass in half a century, albeit beneath the image of communist mass-murderer Che Guevara.

But as then, some of the details were disappointing: The devoutly Catholic dissidents&apos; wives known as the Ladies in White were denied a papal meeting by Vatican officials out of &quot;respect&quot; for the Cuban government host, while in Santiago, a lone man who screamed, &quot;Down with communism!&quot; was beaten and hauled off by Castro&apos;s secret police agents lurking in the crowd. And much to our annoyance, the pope implicitly called for an end to the Cuban trade embargo.

            <title>Western States Tell Washington To Get Off Their Lawns    3.29.12</title>
            <description>Energy: Lawmakers in resource-rich Western states have had enough of Washington&apos;s meddling and are moving to take the federal grip off their lands. Their actions could positively impact gasoline prices.

It seems a new Sagebrush Rebellion is brewing. Last week, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert signed legislation that demands the federal government return 30 million acres to the state by 2014. National parks, military installations and Indian lands would not be part of the return.

Utah is out in front, but it is not alone. Lawmakers in the Arizona Senate have passed a bill similar to Utah&apos;s while the legislatures in Colorado, Idaho, Montana and New Mexico are reportedly following Salt Lake City&apos;s lead.

            <description>Reform: Leaving ObamaCare in place while striking its individual mandate isn&apos;t good enough. The full plan must be scrapped before it drives health premiums even higher.

ObamaCare is wildly unpopular with Americans. Even a new CBS-New York Times poll finds two-thirds want it shot down.

Yes, they&apos;re upset over its unconstitutional mandate requiring all citizens to buy a health insurance policy. But that rule doesn&apos;t go into effect until 2014. Anger arises from those who are already insured and who have seen their premiums skyrocket under ObamaCare.

            <title>House Panel Says Obama &apos;Hides Ball&apos; On Energy Truth    3.29.12</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: House panel votes to issue subpoenas to administration officials involved in doctoring a report on the Gulf oil spill to justify a moratorium and in squelching another that concludes EPA regulations will kill jobs.

The 23-17 vote by the House Natural Resources Committee authorizes subpoenas that will go to agencies such as the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency regarding two issues affecting domestic energy production and jobs.

The first is the alteration of the final report on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico to make it look like a peer review panel approved a moratorium on deep-water drilling, when in fact it did not, and actually said a moratorium would do economic damage while accomplishing little in terms of safety.

            <title>Court Likely To Overturn ObamaCare After Hearings   3.28.12</title>
            <description>Justice: After three days of listening to the government make its case for ObamaCare, one thing is clear: The individual mandate has no constitutional basis or justification, and the entire law should be struck down.

We almost felt sorry for Donald Verrilli, the solicitor general who had to defend the constitutionally indefensible. Over three days of intense interrogation by nine Supreme Court justices, Verrilli failed to muster a single coherent, reasonable argument in support of the ObamaCare law&apos;s constitutionality.

Instead, his shambling, unfocused talking points left the government case in disarray — underscoring what a poorly conceived, badly designed law this was in the first place, and why it must be overturned.

In Verrilli&apos;s defense, we don&apos;t think even Clarence Darrow could have defended a law that runs so afoul of the Constitution&apos;s clear limits on government power.

From the very start on Monday, things went badly for the defense. Justices actually laughed at Verrilli as he tried to argue that penalties imposed under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act weren&apos;t taxes — but rather something new called a &quot;tax penalty.&quot;

            <title>Obama Groveling Before Russians Fulfills 2008 Promise   3.28.12</title>
            <description>Security: The president insists he wasn&apos;t trying to &quot;hide the ball&quot; until after the election, but the man who as candidate pledged to &quot;end misguided defense policies&quot; such as missile defense is fulfilling that campaign promise.

Despite the administration&apos;s rap-dancing with the help of the usual suspects in the mainstream media, it&apos;s clear that the recent meeting between President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Seoul, South Korea, couldn&apos;t be more different in tone and meaning from the one President Ronald Reagan had with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986.

President Obama has tried to explain away his open-mic gaffe when he told Medvedev that he would have more &quot;flexibility&quot; on missile defense after our November election.

He told reporters at the Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul that he was merely talking about the difficulty of dealing with sensitive issues in a politically charged election year for both countries.

            <title>Mob Rule Trumps Rule Of Law In Trayvon Martin Killing   3.28.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: A Democratic ex-Black Panther congressman is escorted off the House floor for disrespecting the institution by wearing a hoodie. Dividing Americans is no way to react to violence.

What is more un-American than forgetting that someone is innocent until proven guilty? Yet Congressional Black Caucus member Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla., on Wednesday appointed herself judge, jury and police detective as she stood in the House of Representatives with a placard that read, &quot;Trayvon Martin&apos;s Murderer Still At Large.&quot;

&quot;I want America to see this sweet young boy who was hunted down like a dog, shot in the street, and his killer is still at large,&quot; Wilson said, adding that &quot;we all know who the murderer is. This was a standard case of racial profiling. No more! No more!&quot;

To some Democrats, investigation, indictment and trial of Martin&apos;s alleged shooter George Zimmerman is unnecessary. The dead man was an angel and his assailant a racist murderer.

            <title>Energy Dept. Disputes Obama&apos;s Foreign Oil Boast    3.28.12</title>
            <description>Gas Crisis: Feeling heat over pump prices, the president is taking credit for reduced foreign oil dependency and higher domestic oil production. But his own Cabinet doesn&apos;t buy it.

Borrowing a gimmick from Ross Perot, President Obama has taken to holding up a chart showing oil imports falling as a share of domestic consumption in his first three years in office.

He&apos;s also flashed the chart, which boasts &quot;U.S. Dependence on Foreign Oil Declining,&quot; as a PowerPoint slide on large screens behind his podium. And aides have handed out copies of it to crowds gathered at his speeches — as well as to media who by and large have reported the boast with unblinking fealty.

The president is obviously very proud of his charts. Too bad he can&apos;t read them as well as Perot. Obama says that, thanks to his energy policies, the U.S. now imports 45% of its crude, down from 57% in 2008. But imports were declining before he took office. They peaked at 60% in 2005 — under the Bush administration.

            <description>Energy: The Obama administration is pushing the first rules ever to cut carbon dioxide emissions in new U.S. power plants. It&apos;s a move that&apos;s sure to make energy a lot more expensive for everyone.

Everyone, of course, likes cleaner air. But the new rules are so draconian that they will lead to an end of the construction of any power plant that uses coal.

The rules will force new power plants to put expensive new equipment to capture and bury emissions underground. If it sounds easy, it isn&apos;t. In fact, the equipment doesn&apos;t even exist yet.

            <itunes:summary>Energy: The Obama administration is pushing the first rules ever to cut carbon dioxide emissions in new U.S. power plants. It&apos;s a move that&apos;s sure to make energy a lot more expensive for everyone.

Everyone, of course, likes cleaner air. But the new rules are so draconian that they will lead to an end of the construction of any power plant that uses coal.

The rules will force new power plants to put expensive new equipment to capture and bury emissions underground. If it sounds easy, it isn&apos;t. In fact, the equipment doesn&apos;t even exist yet.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Medieval Warming Period Cools Climate Change Alarmism   3.27.12</title>
            <description>Environment: Climate change alarmists either ignore the existence of the Medieval Warm Period or say that it was regional rather than global. A new report, however, shows that the warming was worldwide.

The Medieval Warm Period is a profound problem for those who claim that man&apos;s 20th- and 21st-century carbon dioxide emissions are warming the earth.

If an era as warm or warmer than today did indeed exist 500 to 1,000 years ago, before man had invented the CO2-emitting internal combustion engine, then it weakens their claim that any warming occurring now is due to human activity. The reality of such a period is a strong sign that climate change is both natural and cyclical, not moved by man&apos;s modern habits.

            <description>Race: For 30 days, the left has tried to use Trayvon Martin&apos;s tragic shooting death as proof that racism is alive and well in America. But as the facts finally emerge, that carefully nurtured narrative is falling apart.

At first blush, the shooting certainly appears troubling. A 17-year-old African American carrying nothing but a bag of skittles and a bottle of iced tea is shot by a white Neighborhood Watch volunteer.

That was enough for the likes of Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, most of the mainstream press and even President Obama to jump on the story as fresh evidence of ongoing racism in the U.S.

            <title>ObamaCare Mandate Is Really A Big Government Dictate   3.27.12</title>
            <description>Supreme Court: Arguments for and against ObamaCare before the high court this week are complex, but they can&apos;t disguise a simple principle: The Constitution protects us from being forced to buy something.

Tuesday&apos;s Supreme Court oral arguments over ObamaCare&apos;s mandate that Americans must buy health insurance don&apos;t look good for the president.

Justice Anthony Kennedy, so often the powerful swing vote between the left and right blocs of the court, complained to Obama Solicitor General Donald Verrilli that under the mandate &quot;the federal government has a duty to tell the individual citizen that it must act, and that is different from what we have in previous cases and that changes the relationship of the federal government to the individual in a very fundamental way.&quot;

            <title>Will Voters Give Obama The Flexibility To Surrender?  3.26.12</title>
            <description>National Security: The president tells his Russian counterpart to give him space until November when, if re-elected, he&apos;ll be able to give away missile defense and the rest of the store without political consequences.

It seems President Obama has a space program after all, one in which the Russians cool it on the dismantling of U.S. missile defenses until the least transparent administration in history can razzle-dazzle, smoke-and-mirror and divide-and-conquer its way into a second term.

One of the subtexts of the 2012 campaign has been the fear of what a second-term Obama will do unfettered by the need to get re-elected. ObamaCare, the shredding of the Constitution, spending the U.S. into bankruptcy, halting domestic energy production and gutting national and missile defense might be only a foretaste of what candidate Obama really meant when he promised to &quot;fundamentally transform&quot; America.

            <description>War On Terror: The problem of insider attacks against coalition soldiers by Afghan security forces is worse than what&apos;s being reported. The Pentagon has covered up the full extent of the treachery.

On Monday, NATO reported that yet another uniformed Afghan soldier murdered two more coalition soldiers, bringing the official count of such &quot;green-on-blue&quot; casualties to 77. But the actual figure may be more than double. The Pentagon has made it look as if a number of American victims of insider attacks died while fighting in combat.

Take the case of Marine Lance Cpl. Edward J. Dycus, who died Feb. 1 from a gunshot wound while serving in Afghanistan. In the official announcement of his death, the Pentagon said Dycus died &quot;while conducting combat operations.&quot;

            <description>Carter Redux: While President Obama talks about how forward-looking he is when it comes to the nation&apos;s energy, almost everything he&apos;s proposing is just a retread of Jimmy Carter&apos;s failed policies from the 1970s.

In the face of historic gasoline prices and an increasingly agitated public, Obama has taken to lambasting Republicans. They&apos;re members of the Flat Earth Society, he says, and display &quot;a lack of imagination, a belief that you can&apos;t do something in a new way.&quot;

But the only thing imaginative about Obama&apos;s energy plans is how he&apos;s managed to recycle most of them from Jimmy Carter&apos;s playbook without anyone noticing. And we all know how well Carter&apos;s plan worked out.

            <description>Nanny State: It seemed impossible, but New York&apos;s Big Brother Bloomberg has outdone his smoking and trans-fat bans. He is ordering homeless shelters to refuse donated food that isn&apos;t nutritionally &quot;assessed.&quot;

&apos;Let them eat squat&quot; might be an appropriate motto for New York City&apos;s &quot;mayor for life,&quot; Michael Bloomberg, who in 2009 broke his promise to honor the city&apos;s term limits law. He would rather see the five boroughs&apos; downtrodden starve than consume excess cholesterol.

City hall says that it cannot analyze food that organizations have been donating for years or even decades, so the shelters must turn the food away. A new document from the bureaucracy dictates serving sizes, as well as salt, fat and calorie limits, fiber minimums and condiment recommendations.

ngbaAppearing on CNN, senior Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom spoke of this fall&apos;s general election and Romney&apos;s challenge in going up against President Obama:

&quot;Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign,&quot; Fehrnstrom said. &quot;Everything changes. It&apos;s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.&quot;

            <title>Free Markets Shield Mexico From Earthquake Disaster  3.22.12</title>
            <description>Free Markets: Huge 7.4 quake. Third World country. And incredibly, nobody dies. While that makes it &quot;not news&quot; to the TV cameras, in reality, it is news — a very big story about what embracing markets does for places like Mexico.

The major earthquake that rocked southern Mexico Tuesday, including the capital of Mexico City, caused houses to &quot;bounce like trampolines,&quot; according to Reuters. But 24 hours into the news cycle, it looks to be little more than a one-day story.

As it&apos;s said in the news business, if it doesn&apos;t bleed, it doesn&apos;t lead.

            <title>EPA&apos;s Heavy Hand Seen In Gas Crisis  3.22.12</title>
            <description>Regulation: Fearing gas price spikes on the East Coast this summer, Washington pols are trying to talk refiners out of closing unprofitable plants. It&apos;s the EPA they ought to hector.

The untold story behind soaring pump prices is that major U.S. refineries are going out of business and creating at least regional shortages thanks in no small part to costly EPA rules.

Over just the past six months, three refineries supplying about half the gasoline, diesel and jet fuel to the East Coast have closed, including two owned by Sunoco Inc. They say they simply cannot make money anymore.

            <title>Obama&apos;s War On Women: No Health Care For You!  3.22.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: The administration denies funding for a Texas program that serves low-income women because of a law saying the program can&apos;t fund Planned Parenthood. Is this how the president protects women&apos;s health?

Physician, to coin a phrase, heal thyself. The administration, faithful to the Alinsky technique of demonizing one&apos;s opponents and distracting people from real issues, managed to divert attention from ObamaCare&apos;s shredding of the Constitution by forcing religious institutions to provide contraceptives in violation of their religious freedom.

Sandra Fluke, the Georgetown law student whose lifestyle allegedly tottered on insolvency unless free contraception was provided, was trotted forth to explain why not forcing others to buy her a product that was freely available for $9 a month somehow constituted a war on women and women&apos;s health.

            <title>Karzai The Ingrate  3.21.12</title>
            <description>War On Terror: The Afghan leader that American soldiers spilled blood to install to power now calls them &quot;demons.&quot; So why have we entrusted their protection to him? This is the height of insanity.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai has grown increasingly hostile toward our troops, referring to them as occupying &quot;demons&quot; who commit &quot;satanic acts that will never be forgiven by apologies.&quot;

His administration issued a statement with Islamic elders calling the recent violence against U.S. troops over the burning of Qurans &quot;justifiable.&quot; Six American soldiers, including two officers, were murdered.

Yet under a new policy mandated by Karzai, the U.S. has agreed to hand responsibility for security of all military convoys and bases over to the Afghan army and police. Karzai has set a March 2013 deadline for the switch from private security contractors to Afghan government-provided security.

Already, the State Department has contracted with the Afghan Public Protection Force to provide armed escorts or guards for its compounds and development projects in the dangerous country. What a farce. Afghan forces can barely protect themselves, let alone U.S. troops and assets.

            <title>Troubling Things Obama&apos;s Spring Break Story Reveal    3.21.12</title>
            <description>Media: We normally wouldn&apos;t bother writing about the president&apos;s daughter, but the story of Malia Obama&apos;s spring break deserves mention if only because it&apos;s troubling on so many levels.

First you have to wonder about sending a 13-year-old to drug-war-torn Mexico to frolic with her friends. It doesn&apos;t strike us as the wisest move, given the potential risk to her and those around her.

Then there&apos;s President Obama&apos;s indifference to the country&apos;s perilous financial situation.

With deficits topping $1 trillion, you&apos;d think he&apos;d set an example by scotching a trip that required 25 very expensive Secret Service baby sitters. Surely there were less costly places for her to go.

If Obama had been a Republican, you can bet such profligacy would be the talk of the town. But when a newswire mentioned Malia&apos;s trip, the White House demanded the stories be taken down from various sites where they had appeared, reminding them that the Obamas want their children kept off-limits.

Fair enough. Children should not be media targets simply because their parents are politicians.

But given the costs involved and the location of the vacation, this was a legitimate story.

            <title>Stockton Woes Send A Message On Pension Reform    3.21.12</title>
            <description>Local Government: As one California city slogs toward bankruptcy, others may soon try to avoid the same fate by passing pension reforms — that is, if a pro-union state government will let them.

The financial problems plaguing many of the nation&apos;s cities are taking a particularly heavy toll on Stockton, Calif., a blue-collar port city that struggles even in good times.

Perched on the edge of central California&apos;s delta, about an hour south of Sacramento, the city has had some of the highest home foreclosure and unemployment rates in a state that ranks high in both categories.

As if that weren&apos;t enough, Stockton is also a cautionary tale on how not to run a city. It seems to have committed just about every fiscal sin known to local government.

In those infrequent years when things were good, it spent (and promised) like there was no tomorrow. Now tomorrow has come, and the city is broke. Its spiffy sports arena and its new $35 million high-rise city hall won&apos;t help it pay its debt.

That debt includes, but is not limited to, a $400 million liability for its retirees&apos; health care. It has 94 retirees with pensions of $100,000 a year or more. It also has had to cut its police force by almost a third.

            <title>Revenues From Buffett Rule Don&apos;t Really Cut Deficit    3.21.12</title>
            <description>Tax Policy: The president wants a wrinkle in the tax code that will take more dollars from the wealthy. But it would be a useless tool of class warfare, producing less than $3 billion a year in additional revenues.

Last fall, President Obama proposed increasing the tax rate on millionaires. The plan is in part a response to the story, which has been debunked, that investor Warren Buffett&apos;s secretary Debbie Bosanek pays a higher tax rate than does Buffett himself.

Still, Obama says a &quot;Buffett Rule&quot; is needed to ensure that no rich household would &quot;pay a smaller share of its income in taxes than middle-class families pay.&quot;

Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., took up the cause when he introduced in February the Paying a Fair Share Act.

This bill would force all Americans who make more than $1 million a year from all sources of income combined to pay at least 30% of that income to Washington.

Of course, fairness isn&apos;t the real issue. It&apos;s about draining more money from taxpayers, about stocking the public fisc with greater sums of money for lawmakers to lavish on their constituencies. If fairness were the goal, Whitehouse would be cutting taxes on the rich down to middle-class rates.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Keystone XL Visit A Potemkin Village Photo-Op   3.21.12</title>
            <description>Politics: The president stages a photo-op in Oklahoma to take credit for the portion of the Keystone XL pipeline that doesn&apos;t need his approval and for oil production on private and state lands beyond his jurisdiction.

If one of his aides some morning remarked on a particularly lovely sunrise, it wouldn&apos;t surprise us if President Obama responded with a &quot;thank you,&quot; so gifted is he in taking credit for successes that he has nothing to do with and that occur despite, not because, of his policies.

So it will be Thursday, when Obama is scheduled to appear in Cushing, Okla., known as the pipeline capital of the world, to take credit for the southern half of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project announced weeks ago by TransCanada, the Keystone builder.

It&apos;s the section that doesn&apos;t need presidential or State Department approval since it does not cross an international boundary.

So it will be Thursday, when Obama is scheduled to appear in Cushing, Okla., known as the pipeline capital of the world, to take credit for the southern half of the Keystone XL pipeline, a project announced weeks ago by TransCanada, the Keystone builder.

It&apos;s the section that doesn&apos;t need presidential or State Department approval since it does not cross an international boundary.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Democrats&apos; Policies Aren&apos;t In Young Voters&apos; Interest   3.20.12</title>
            <description>Future: Mitt Romney said Monday that he fails to &quot;see how a young American can vote&quot; for a Democrat. He may have something there. Coming generations will be doomed by the progressive policies of today.

Outside of their desire to intern capitalism and replace it with a euro-style welfare statism, Democrats are not a forward-looking group.

Although they fancy themselves as &quot;progressives,&quot; their ideas are truly regressive. The future? For the Democrats, it&apos;s all about the next election:

            <title>Deadly ATF Fast And Furious Game Of Catch And Release   3.20.12</title>
            <description>Scandal: A prime suspect in the smuggling of weapons to Mexico was captured and released on a promise of cooperation and with the instruction not to engage in criminal acts unless instructed by the U.S. government.

If the purpose of Fast and Furious, the gun-running operation directed out of the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was to track and capture those involved in smuggling illegal firearms to Mexico, it seemingly succeeded with the May 29, 2010, capture of Manuel Fabian Celis-Acosta as he drove his BMW in a remote area of Arizona near the Mexican border.

Documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times show that Acosta was found with 74 rounds of ammunition and nine cellphones in his car as he headed south through the border town of Lukeville, Ariz.

            <title>Ryan Shows Who&apos;s Responsible In Washington   3.20.12</title>
            <description>Federal Spending: Thanks to Rep. Paul Ryan, voters have a clear picture of what the two political parties stand for today. Republicans are the party of fiscal restraint; Democrats are the party of fiscal ruin.

When President Obama put out his first budget plan in 2009, he called it &quot;A New Era of Responsibility.&quot; It was anything but responsible, running massive deficits on huge new federal &quot;stimulus&quot; programs that failed to stimulate anything.

And in the three years since, Obama has become still more irresponsible, running $1 trillion-plus deficits each year and piling on more debt than George W. Bush did in eight. His latest budget is another case in point.

            <title>Ryan Tax Plan Is Powerful Antidote To Obamanomics   3.20.12</title>
            <description>Tax Reform: Faced with the economic failures of a Democratic president, Rep. Paul Ryan is, like Ronald Reagan, &quot;raising a banner of no pale pastels, but bold colors.&quot; Ryan&apos;s Rx for America: a jobs-generating tax code.

The Republicans running for president could learn a lesson from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis. If, as the GOP candidates say, we really have gone miles down the wrong fiscal and economic road, and we surely have, then we require something bold and substantive to take us in the right direction.

The Ryan tax reform is something Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and even the eccentric Ron Paul should endorse with enthusiasm. They might even want to follow it up with a pledge to appoint ideas man Ryan as Treasury secretary.

            <title>Despite Egypt&apos;s Crackdown, U.S. To Give It More Aid   3.19.12</title>
            <description>Mideast: As Iran races toward a nuclear bomb and Afghanistan unravels, a distracted U.S. seems ready to make a big mistake in Egypt. It&apos;s reinstating aid to a new government that despises us and the rest of the West.

President Obama appears poised this week to reinstate $1.5 billion in military aid to Egypt. Congress suspended the aid after Egypt repeatedly violated basic democratic freedoms. Violations included the military regime&apos;s prosecution of 43 U.S. and Egyptian pro-democracy workers, a brutal crackdown on protests and the continued violent oppression of women and Christians, among other things.

Also this week, the International Monetary Fund, with a nod from the U.S., is in Egypt negotiating a $3.2 billion loan to bail out its broke rulers.

            <title>Government Goes Off The Deep End, Regulates Hotel Pools   3.19.12</title>
            <description>Regulatory Tyranny: Washington has extended the deadline by 60 days for hotels to install lifts for the disabled in their pools. But nothing changes in two months. The government will still be invading private matters.

The regulation was to take effect last week. But the Justice Department has given hotels an additional 60 days to comply. How generous.

The regulation, written by the Obama administration in 2010 based on the Americans With Disabilities Act, affects nearly every one of the roughly 51,000 hotels in the U.S., since there are few that have no pools.

            <title>Paul Krugman Drills Dry Hole On Oil, Gas Fracking   3.19.12</title>
            <description>Energy: The economist at the newspaper of record defends the president&apos;s energy policy of Solyndra, Chevy Volts and algae while dismissing the oil boom on private lands as a small-town hiccup with no impact on price.

New York Times columnist and Keynesian economist Paul Krugman asks in a recent column why gas prices are rising if we are in the middle of a domestic oil boom. Doesn&apos;t the &quot;drill, baby, drill&quot; crowd claim, he argues, that prices will drop &quot;if only we would stop protecting the environment and let energy companies do whatever they want&quot;?

Without our domestic oil boom, created by reinvested energy company profits largely on private and state lands, gas prices would be worse. Keynes did not repeal the law of supply and demand, Mr. Krugman, and increased worldwide demand from places like China has helped keep prices up.

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad calls the state of Israel a &quot;disgraceful blot&quot; that ought to be &quot;wiped off the face of the earth.&quot;

But as much as the Jewish state has to fear from the Ayatollah Khamenei and the rest of Tehran&apos;s Islamofascist fanatics seeking an Islamic holy war, there are Muslim rulers with at least as much to fear.

            <title>Disarming America: Obama Betrays Reagan&apos;s Dream   3.16.12</title>
            <description>The Obama Record: The president&apos;s shredding of the Constitution began at the Preamble&apos;s provision for the common defense. He gave away our missile defense to appease Moscow and betray our allies.

Derided as Star Wars, the Strategic Defense Initiative announced by President Reagan on March 23, 1983, was to be the fulfillment of his dream of being able to deter or even defeat a nuclear missile attack, rather than avenge one, with a multilayered system of defenses aimed at enemy missiles in all stages of flight.

SDI and its concept of defending America and its allies were attacked as destabilizing and the cause of a new arms race. In truth, it was an extension of Reagan&apos;s strategy of &quot;we win, they lose,&quot; which would confront and defeat, rather than merely contain, the USSR.

When Reagan met with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, there was no talk of special relationships or reset buttons, only a commitment by the leader of the Free World to defend the U.S. against nuclear missile attack. Reagan stood firm, and the Soviet Union would soon collapse.

            <itunes:summary>The Obama Record: The president&apos;s shredding of the Constitution began at the Preamble&apos;s provision for the common defense. He gave away our missile defense to appease Moscow and betray our allies.

Derided as Star Wars, the Strategic Defense Initiative announced by President Reagan on March 23, 1983, was to be the fulfillment of his dream of being able to deter or even defeat a nuclear missile attack, rather than avenge one, with a multilayered system of defenses aimed at enemy missiles in all stages of flight.

SDI and its concept of defending America and its allies were attacked as destabilizing and the cause of a new arms race. In truth, it was an extension of Reagan&apos;s strategy of &quot;we win, they lose,&quot; which would confront and defeat, rather than merely contain, the USSR.

When Reagan met with Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland, in October 1986, there was no talk of special relationships or reset buttons, only a commitment by the leader of the Free World to defend the U.S. against nuclear missile attack. Reagan stood firm, and the Soviet Union would soon collapse.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Jerry Brown Dances To A Union Tune On State Taxes   3.16.12</title>
            <description>States: A tax-hike deal that California&apos;s governor has made with teachers is more cave-in than compromise. Voters need to understand who&apos;s calling the shots in Sacramento.

Jerry Brown has come a long way since 1992, when he ran on a flat-tax platform in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Now he&apos;s on board with a ballot initiative that would make California&apos;s already steep income tax even steeper.

Something inside him may still be telling him this is a bad idea. But he doesn&apos;t have a choice. He may be the state&apos;s top elected official, but he&apos;s really not in charge.

That fact became clear in the past week, when Brown made a deal with one of state&apos;s teacher unions to resolve a conflict between dueling tax initiatives headed for the November ballot.

Brown had a plan that would have raised sales taxes by a half-cent for four years and hiked the top income-tax rate for five years to 12.3% from 10.3%.

The California Federation of Teachers (CFT), with a coalition of liberal activist groups in tow, wanted an even higher tax on high earners — 13.3% on income over $1 million — with no sales tax hike and no expiration date.

            <title>CBO Exposes Obama&apos;s $2 Tril Budget Sleight of Hand   3.16.12</title>
            <description>Federal Spending: If you want to know why Washington can&apos;t get spending under control, this week provided a prime example, when the Congressional Budget Office said President Obama&apos;s &quot;budget-cutting&quot; plan would actually boost spending $1 trillion.

When Obama released his budget last month, he said the spending cuts contained in it would &quot;generate approximately $1 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade.&quot;

&quot;Every department will feel the impact of these reductions,&quot; he said, &quot;as they cut programs or tighten their belts.&quot;

But this week, the Congressional Budget Office released its analysis of Obama&apos;s budget.

And lo and behold, rather than cut spending by $1 trillion over the next decade, the CBO says it would increase it by more than $1 trillion.

So just what explains this shift of more than $2 trillion? Welcome to the world of &quot;baseline budgeting.&quot;

You see, Obama simply assumed that spending would go up faster if the government were left on autopilot. Then he lowered the spending levels a bit in his budget and — voila! — he&apos;s cutting spending.

The Congressional Budget Office, however, uses a more conservative baseline projection.

            <title>Drill Our Way to Lower Oil Prices? Yes We Can!   3.15.12</title>
            <description>Energy: Just as President Obama was lecturing the country about how more drilling won&apos;t lower gas prices, oil markets called his lie — cutting prices $2 a barrel in mere talk of releasing some oil from the strategic reserve.

As the Washington Post reported on Thursday, oil prices &quot;dropped quickly ... on a news report that Britain and the United States would cooperate on a release of crude oil from strategic reserves.&quot;

Got that? On a news report. No oil has been released. It&apos;s not even clear if any ever will, since the Obama administration can&apos;t get its story straight. And even if the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) were tapped, it would only be for a relatively small amount.

            <description>China: As he prepares to leave office, Premier Wen Jiabao has a surprising message for the Communist Party: Get ready for democracy, or face trouble. Has the China Spring begun?

The media are filled with tales of how China will soon pass the U.S. as the world&apos;s No. 1 economy. In fact, the nation of 1.3 billion faces monumental challenges that will lead to a slower economy, declining population and fiscal crisis in the coming years.

After growing at a 10% clip for nearly three decades, China&apos;s economy is slowing. This year, the government estimates GDP will expand just 7.5% — barely fast enough to create jobs, income, investment and opportunity in such a vast developing nation.

            <title>Bigot Chris Matthews&apos; War On Catholics And Mormons   3.15.12</title>
            <description>Bias: Having lost that tingly feeling up his leg, MSNBC&apos;s Chris Matthews savages GOP presidential candidates as belonging to cults. Well, at least they didn&apos;t spend two decades listening to the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.

Imagine the uproar if Rush Limbaugh had called Islam a cult. Yet there was Matthews, whose legs once twitched at every word coming from Barack Obama&apos;s teleprompter, telling fellow MSNBC left-winger Ed Schultz in the presence of the Rev. Al Sharpton that the GOP has &quot;two RCs — Roman Catholics — running and a Mormon, so three cultists running.&quot;

Having Matthews, Schultz and Sharpton on the same show is perhaps the greatest collection of intolerant minds ever assembled, with the possible exception of when David Duke dines alone.

            <description>War On Terror: Publicly, the president talks tough about the Taliban. But privately, he has waved the white flag, begging for a truce while even promising to free Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay.

At Wednesday&apos;s joint White House press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron, Obama did not level with the American public when he claimed he has broken the back of the Taliban and stopped their forward momentum.

&quot;What&apos;s undeniable,&quot; he claimed, &quot;is that our forces are making very real progress: dismantling al-Qaida; breaking the Taliban&apos;s momentum; and training Afghan forces so that they can take the lead and our troops can come home.&quot;

            <description>Geopolitics: The U.S. has reportedly been reduced to warning Iran about its nuclear weapons program by Russian messenger. Maybe Moscow can just use the packing slip in its next shipment of nuclear components.

America&apos;s global influence is in pretty pathetic condition when we&apos;re enlisting Vladimir Putin&apos;s Russia to tell a terrorist client state how tough we are.

According to the Christian Science Monitor, the Russian-language Moscow daily Kommersant reported Wednesday that a prominent but unnamed Russian diplomatic source said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton asked Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to deliver an ultimatum to Tehran.

            <title>Washington Distracts Us As Fiscal Disaster Looms  3.14.12</title>
            <description>Budget: Our out-of-control federal debt is a lot like a bad disease: Just because you ignore it doesn&apos;t mean it will go away. Even as pundits and economists tout a U.S. recovery, our fiscal picture just keeps getting worse.

Weird, isn&apos;t it, that politicians have almost stopped talking about the worsening fiscal picture and are instead talking up the economy, the stock market, female contraception, Rush Limbaugh — anything but our budget.

That&apos;s why it was good to hear former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels make a case this week in rather stark terms that our budget deficits and growing debt have to be tackled right away, or we&apos;ll lose control of our future.

&quot;Whether one believes in a large, very active government or something more limited, mathematically the amount of debt we already have and the terrifying rate at which it is accumulating will lead to national ruin,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no other outcome arithmetically possible.&quot;

Unfortunately, the debate over our soaring deficits and debts too often is posed simply as a political fight.

Sorry, but wherever you are on the political spectrum on spending, taxes, deficits and debts, the reality is unless we change course soon, we&apos;ll soon be bust. Period.

            <itunes:summary>Budget: Our out-of-control federal debt is a lot like a bad disease: Just because you ignore it doesn&apos;t mean it will go away. Even as pundits and economists tout a U.S. recovery, our fiscal picture just keeps getting worse.

Weird, isn&apos;t it, that politicians have almost stopped talking about the worsening fiscal picture and are instead talking up the economy, the stock market, female contraception, Rush Limbaugh — anything but our budget.

That&apos;s why it was good to hear former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels make a case this week in rather stark terms that our budget deficits and growing debt have to be tackled right away, or we&apos;ll lose control of our future.

&quot;Whether one believes in a large, very active government or something more limited, mathematically the amount of debt we already have and the terrifying rate at which it is accumulating will lead to national ruin,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no other outcome arithmetically possible.&quot;

Unfortunately, the debate over our soaring deficits and debts too often is posed simply as a political fight.

Sorry, but wherever you are on the political spectrum on spending, taxes, deficits and debts, the reality is unless we change course soon, we&apos;ll soon be bust. Period.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama Obliged to Return Hate Speech Comic&apos;s Million   3.14.12</title>
            <description>Incivility: Misogyny and hate-mongering are not things President Obama wants his re-election campaign tainted by. There&apos;s no avoiding getting his Super-PAC to return sleaze merchant Bill Maher&apos;s million dollars.

Just when you thought there couldn&apos;t be any worse double standards, a sewer-mouthed &quot;comedian&quot; gives a million smackers to help re-elect President Obama, yet the major media and leading Democrats think it&apos;s fine.

The same Democrats and media organizations blew a socket when Rush Limbaugh used &quot;slut&quot; to describe a feminist activist who wants taxpayers to finance her efforts at avoiding pregnancy. But consider how Bill Maher has treated Sarah Palin.

Not only has he called her the c-word in his act, and another four-letter obscenity with the same meaning; he compared Palin to a &quot;pimp&quot; and called her family — which includes a son with Down Syndrome — &quot;inbred.&quot;

Maher also lumped former presidential candidate Michele Bachmann and Palin together using an obscene four-letter acronym little known outside pornographic chat rooms.

            <title>If Obama&apos;s Past Isn&apos;t A Concern, Why Cover It Up?  3.14.12</title>
            <description>Public Trust: The Beltway elite mock critics who say the president&apos;s hiding his radical past from voters. They say there&apos;s nothing there, move along. But if there&apos;s nothing to hide, why is so much hidden?

And if the White House isn&apos;t worried about the public seeing another side of President Obama, why is it trying to reinforce the image of him as a post-racial, pro-American moderate with a slick new Hollywood-produced 17-minute documentary?

The answer, of course, is that it is very much concerned.

The Obama campaign knows its carefully manicured narrative is wearing thin against the drip-drip-drip of revelations about his extremism. And it can&apos;t risk the incumbent being reintroduced to voters this election as an untrustworthy imposter who&apos;s hiding things about himself and his agenda.

Indeed, these are things that must be hidden from the average voter. They are unpatriotic and unelectable things. Things that would concern any red-blooded American, if not the parlor Bolsheviks inside the Beltway media and the Ivory Tower.

The videotape of Obama praising and hugging his America-bashing, Constitution-trashing law professor Derrick Bell isn&apos;t the only evidence that&apos;s been hidden from the public. A 1998 video of Obama praising the late Marxist agitator Saul &quot;The Red&quot; Alinsky alongside a panel of hard-core Chicago communists also exists. Yet it, too, has been withheld.

            <title>An Obama Friend And His Communist Connection   3.14.12</title>
            <description>Vetting: That a U.S. congressman has been honored by a communist group is in itself noteworthy. That the congressman is a political ally of President Obama whose values he shares is even more so.

Late last month, Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat who has represented Chicago&apos;s Loop since 1998, accepted the Chris Hani and Rudy Lozano Social Justice Award from the People&apos;s World, an online news provider that, according to its website, enjoys &quot;a special relationship with the Communist Party USA&quot; and publishes &quot;its news and views.&quot; Part of its editorial mission is &quot;to popularize the ideas of Marxism and Bill of Rights socialism.&quot;

There was no mainstream media coverage of the award ceremony, just a RebelPundit.com video of Davis accepting the award and a sidewalk interview that turned confrontational when the congressman&apos;s comrades tried to intimidate Jeremy Segal, the self-described citizen journalist of RebelPundit who was asking legitimate questions and peacefully shooting the video.

Segal bookends the Davis portion of the video with clips of President Obama in 2004 telling a group that the reason Davis is &quot;one of the best congressmen in the country&quot; is that &quot;he shares our values.&quot; Davis introduces Obama at the rally as a &quot;friend of mine.&quot;

Having a member of the Congress so closely aligned with the Communist Party should be better publicized. Would it be acceptable if he received an award from a Nazi group? A fascist organization? Of course not.

            <title>$1.76 Trillion ObamaCare Cost Doubles Down On Failure  3.14.12</title>
            <description>Medical Reform: We had to pass it to find what was in it, we were told. As the lies and consequences of health care reform become known, the Congressional Budget Office reveals its true cost — another lie all unto itself.

ObamaCare was sold in part as a way to rein in health care costs, including insurance premiums, and as a big step toward reducing the deficit. Using an accounting gimmick that would make even a Bernie Madoff blush, 10 years of taxes were counted against six years of &quot;benefits&quot; to produce huge projected savings.

As we noted at the time, the 2014 date for benefits to start flowing was deliberately chosen to mask the full costs and delay the impact until after the 2012 elections. Had the full impact of ObamaCare been added to the administration&apos;s war on business and energy, the economy might well have collapsed, and we suspect the White House knew that.

The strategy of hide and delay may have collapsed with a new Congressional Budget Office report that reveals that the current 10-year cost of ObamaCare is an astounding $1.76 trillion. That&apos;s nearly double the $900 billion President Obama told a special session of Congress on Sept. 9, 2009, that ObamaCare would cost. He also claimed the &quot;plan will not add to our deficit.&quot;

            <title>Obama&apos;s Limits On Oil Output Cause Higher Gas Prices   3.13.12</title>
            <description>Energy: President Obama says Newt Gingrich &quot;isn&apos;t telling the truth&quot; when he claims he could cut the price of gas to $2.50 a gallon if elected. Well, the price of gas when Obama took office was $1.83 a gallon. Was that a lie?

&apos;There&apos;s no silver bullet&quot; for high gas prices, the president said Monday. This is utterly false. The &quot;silver bullet&quot; for anything in short supply is to make more of it, which lowers the price — something Obama steadfastly refuses to do with oil.

When Obama entered office in January 2009, a gallon of unleaded gasoline went for about $1.83. Today, that same gas goes for $3.53 — a 93% increase. Some of it, of course, is the Iran crisis. But, as the American Petroleum Institute (API) notes, that&apos;s not the main problem. Obama&apos;s policies are.

            <description>Regulation: Over the first three years of each administration, Obama&apos;s White House created four times as many rules as the Bush administration. This is the regulatory regime that was supposed to bring growth and job creation.

A White House website video shows President Obama next to the stack of volumes comprising the ever-growing Federal Register of regulations, touting an executive order promising to &quot;reduce burdens for American businesses and consumers when developing rules.&quot;

But three months ago, with a business-loathing political base in need of election-year red meat, Obama was in Osawatomie, Kan., mocking those who say, &quot;If we just cut more regulations ... then jobs and prosperity will eventually trickle down to everybody else.&quot;

In 2011, more businesses (254) quit California than the year before (202), which was a high-water mark over 2009 (51). Last year, roughly five businesses left in any given week, one more than left in each week of 2010 when the average was 3.9.

At one time, California was truly the land of opportunity. But the business climate has turned hostile.

            <itunes:summary>States: &quot;You can check out any time you like,&quot; the Eagles said of California, &quot;but you can never leave.&quot; Somebody forgot to tell businesses. They keep leaving the Golden State in growing numbers.

In 2011, more businesses (254) quit California than the year before (202), which was a high-water mark over 2009 (51). Last year, roughly five businesses left in any given week, one more than left in each week of 2010 when the average was 3.9.

At one time, California was truly the land of opportunity. But the business climate has turned hostile.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Eric Holder Plays Texas Hold &apos;Em In Voter ID Suit    3.13.12</title>
            <description>Voting Rights: The most politicized attorney general in American history takes on Texas&apos; Voter ID law as discriminatory and intimidating to minorities, and tries to make American elections safe for vote fraud.

The Justice Department&apos;s civil rights division, the same group that dropped the case of a group of New Black Panthers wearing military garb and carrying billy clubs as they stood outside a Philadelphia polling place in 2008, has filed an objection in U.S. District Court to Texas&apos; voter identification law on the grounds it intimidates minorities and suppresses minority voter turnout.

Photo IDs and the requirement that they be shown are ever present in our society — from cashing a check to boarding a plane to entering Eric Holder&apos;s own Department of Justice. Yet Holder, who once said criticism of him and his boss, President Obama, was due to their skin color, sees racism in Texas&apos; move to guarantee the sanctity of the ballot box.

            <title>Karma Comedian: Obama&apos;s &apos;Undriveable&apos; Electric Car    3.12.12</title>
            <description>Industrial Policy: A leading consumer product testing firm takes one of the administration&apos;s dream green cars for a spin and had to call a gasoline-powered flatbed truck to tow the lemon away.

At least it can go from zero to $529 million in stimulus dollars in nothing flat. When the testers at Consumer Reports took it for a test drive, not only was the $107,850 dream car unable to complete the evaluation, but also it had to be towed away, a visible metaphor for the Obama administration&apos;s green energy failures.

In a test conducted last Wednesday by Consumer Reports magazine, the niche-market sports car conked out after a short ride at 65 miles an hour on a Connecticut test track.

            <title>Media Need To Put Murder Of 16 Afghans In Perspective    3.12.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: A U.S. soldier went berserk and killed 16 Afghan civilians on Sunday. The political class is brimming with apologies, and the punditocracy is wringing its hands. Some perspective and backbone are in order here.

Make no mistake, a staff sergeant&apos;s house-to-house massacre of 16 mostly women and children in their beds in Afghanistan&apos;s Kandahar has the look of a war crime that must be punished.

But the facts aren&apos;t all in, and rather than keeping eyes on what&apos;s certainly an individual crime with an as yet-unknown motive, critics of the entire U.S. effort to rebuild Afghanistan have used the tragedy to indict America. That includes political leaders and the mainstream media with their own axes to grind.

            <title>Obama Has No Faults, Says Obama Documentary Director    3.12.12</title>
            <description>Bias: It&apos;s no shock the filmmaker behind Al Gore&apos;s deceitful &quot;Inconvenient Truth&quot; finds Barack Obama faultless. But even Obama apologists are embarrassed by Davis Guggenheim&apos;s documentary on the president.

CNN is usually friendly ground for Obama propagandists, but the cable channel&apos;s British replacement for Larry King, Piers Morgan, who has conducted many a slanted, unfair interview of Republicans and conservatives, couldn&apos;t give the maker of &quot;The Road We&apos;ve Traveled&quot; a pass last week.

&quot;What are the negatives in your movie about Barack Obama,&quot; Morgan asked Guggenheim, pointing out that documentary filmmakers usually seek balance. &quot;The negative for me,&quot; Guggenheim replied, &quot;was there were too many accomplishments. I had 17 minutes to put them all in there.&quot;

            <description>Election 2012: Ever deeper into the primary season the Republicans go without having yet chosen a nominee. They will eventually settle on one, but in the meantime the GOP candidates need to keep the focus on the economy.

To paraphrase a slogan that helped one Democrat win the White House not so many years ago, it&apos;s still the economy, stupid. Today&apos;s widespread anxiety about economic conditions has made President Obama vulnerable to a GOP challenger who has superior ideas.

Coming into 2012, Americans began to feel better about the economy.

            <title>Is Another Mediocre Jobs Report The Best We Can Do?   3.9.12</title>
            <description>Employment: The media and economics pundits were almost giddy over the not-so-surprising news that the economy added 227,000 payroll jobs in February. Is this the best we can do? We hope not.

Sure, three months of 200,000-plus job creation is a great thing. We&apos;re happy for all those Americans who are now putting on their work clothes and earning a paycheck.

But this is far short of the growth needed. And that&apos;s not sour grapes. It&apos;s a statistical fact. Let&apos;s just look for a moment at the true state of the U.S. jobs economy.

As IBD&apos;s own Ed Carson noted on investors.com, U.S. jobs peaked 49 months ago and we&apos;re not even close to being back. That&apos;s the longest jobs recession since the Great Depression. Meanwhile, GDP growth hasn&apos;t topped 4% in almost six years — the longest stretch of sub-4% growth ever. And we&apos;re supposed to cheer this?

The best one can say is that, based on current data, we&apos;re still down more than 5 million jobs from where we were 49 months ago. Even at February&apos;s rate, it would take until February 2014 just to get back to even.

Not much to brag about, is it?

            <title>Dim Bulbs At The Department Of Energy   3.9.12</title>
            <description>Energy: As gas prices hit $3.79 (and $4.20 in California), Energy Secretary Steven Chu admits he doesn&apos;t own a car. Seems he doesn&apos;t own any lights either, since he just gave a $10 million &quot;affordability prize&quot; for a $50 bulb.

Chu says the prize — awarded to Philips for its new LED bulb — was meant to spur development of advanced, superefficient light bulbs that are &quot;affordable for American families.&quot;

But at $50 a pop, even the one-percenters will find it hard to afford lighting their mansions.

And maybe Chu hasn&apos;t shopped at Home Depot lately, but there&apos;s already a bulb on the market that&apos;s highly affordable. It&apos;s the thing Thomas Edison invented a while back, and it costs just 37 cents.

Of course, the green bulb crowd explains that LEDs — along with the garish neon bulbs — cut electricity use, which is why they&apos;re forcing Americans to buy them. Just make sure you don&apos;t drop one.

To make matters even more ridiculous, Chu actually managed to find the most expensive LED on the market for his affordability prize. Two others brands sell for almost half the price of Philips&apos;. As Home Depot&apos;s Brad Paulsen told the Washington Post, &quot;This is a Cadillac product.&quot;

But ineptitude is par for the course at Chu&apos;s Energy Department. This is the same crowd, after all, that handed out $535 million in loans to Solyndra, only to have the company squander the money and go bankrupt.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Energy Policy Is Running on Empty   3.9.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: President Obama may think gasoline is the &quot;fuel of the past,&quot; but for families facing record prices, it&apos;s very much a today thing. Unfortunately for them, Obama has no credible ideas for getting prices down tomorrow.

As gas prices continue to break records, Obama&apos;s running around the country trying to convince the public he&apos;s doing everything he possibly can.

He claims to have sharply increased oil production, but adds that the U.S. can&apos;t affect the global price of oil because we sit on so little of it. The only real solution, he claims, is to invest in the &quot;fuels of tomorrow.&quot;

It&apos;s all bogus, as we&apos;ve pointed out many times. The recent production gains have nothing whatsoever to do with Obama, but resulted from advanced drilling techniques on private lands or from offshore leases granted long before he entered the White House.

Whenever Obama&apos;s had a chance, he&apos;s tried to cut off supplies to appease environmentalists — the latest of which is his killing of the Keystone XL pipeline.

Saying the U.S. can&apos;t do anything about world prices is false as well, resting on the phony claim that we have only 2% of the world&apos;s oil. In fact, we&apos;re awash in oil, with enough to meet all our needs for 250 years if the government would stop roping so much of it off.

            <itunes:summary>Leadership: President Obama may think gasoline is the &quot;fuel of the past,&quot; but for families facing record prices, it&apos;s very much a today thing. Unfortunately for them, Obama has no credible ideas for getting prices down tomorrow.

As gas prices continue to break records, Obama&apos;s running around the country trying to convince the public he&apos;s doing everything he possibly can.

He claims to have sharply increased oil production, but adds that the U.S. can&apos;t affect the global price of oil because we sit on so little of it. The only real solution, he claims, is to invest in the &quot;fuels of tomorrow.&quot;

            <title>Obama Turns Keystone Pipe Dream To Nightmare  3.9.12</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: After presidential lobbying, the Senate fell four votes short of taking a giant step toward energy independence as gas prices and unemployment rise. In the White House, everything is going according to plan.

The 56-42 vote defeated a proposal by Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., that would have granted approval of the pipeline without any further environmental reviews by the State Department. It came after President Obama personally called lawmakers to lobby for the Hoeven amendment&apos;s defeat. Sixty votes were needed for passage to avoid a filibuster.

As we&apos;ve said, you have to watch what Obama does, not what he says. Press Secretary Jay Carney says the president has not blocked the pipeline, but once again he has. Carney blames the GOP for trying to rush a review, yet the project has been studied for three years, almost as long as it took to win World War II.

In recent speeches, the president has taken credit for the things he has no control over and which his Environmental Protection Agency has been unable to stop. An example is increased oil and natural gas production from shale on private and state lands using a technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.

            <title>The Harvard Hug: What Else Are Media Hiding?  3.9.12</title>
            <description>Bias: We were wrong. The media elite did in fact vet this president, but they covered up what they found. And now that citizen journalists are digging it up, they&apos;re trying to rebury it.

Exhibit A is the controversial video of Barack Obama praising and hugging radical Harvard law professor Derrick Bell. The media knew it existed four years ago and conspired with academia to hide it to get Obama elected.

&quot;We hid this during the 2008 campaign,&quot; confessed Harvard law professor Charles Ogletree. PBS had it then, but cut both the audio and the hug in a report on Obama&apos;s Harvard days. The footage served as wallpaper. Now that Breitbart.com has put the entire video online, the major media have gone into damage-control mode for Obama.

PBS claims, disingenuously, &quot;there&apos;s nothing new about the clip.&quot; NBC&apos;s Andrea Mitchell misled viewers by claiming Bell was &quot;not a radical firebrand&quot; but a &quot;distinguished professor.&quot;

Yahoo News declared the video &quot;a dud,&quot; and CNN devoted a full segment to shoot it down. &quot;Is that it? What part of that was the bombshell? Because I missed it,&quot; said host Soledad O&apos;Brien. So what if the president hugged Bell? He was a &quot;renowned Harvard Law School professor!&quot;

And one of her favorites, as it turns out. After he died last year, O&apos;Brien tweeted: &quot;Professor Derrick Bell died yesterday also. Rough day.&quot; And: &quot;Just started rereading Derrick Bell&apos;s &apos;Ethical Ambition.&apos; Read it. RIP Prof. Bell.&quot;

O&apos;Brien never disclosed to CNN viewers that she was a personal fan of Bell. Nor did Fox News&apos; Juan Williams when he also pooh-poohed the video: &quot;What is this, guilt by association?&quot; Williams endorsed Bell&apos;s incendiary books as a Washington Post scribe.

They knew what he was about. Anybody who has read Bell&apos;s works knows he&apos;s militantly anti-white and anti-America. He didn&apos;t try to hide that, unlike his fans in the media today.

            <title>Derrick Bell: The Jeremiah Wright Of Harvard 3.8.12</title>
            <description>Presidential Vetting: Obama&apos;s days at Harvard have been shrouded in secrecy. But a new video lifts a corner of the veil, revealing his creepy embrace of the &quot;Jeremiah Wright of academia.&quot;

It turns out his favorite law professor was the late Derrick Bell, a black radical who taught classes trashing the Constitution as racist.

He liked Bell so much he led a law school &quot;strike&quot; in support of him in 1991, when the professor went on unpaid leave to protest the lack of affirmative-action hiring on campus.

A video clip posted by Breitbart.com captures Obama praising Bell for &quot;speaking the truth&quot; and hugging him.

            <description>Politics: Does the Constitution matter in executive decisions to go to war, or is the U.S. military just the president&apos;s plaything, subject to his getting U.N. &quot;permission&quot; to use it? Unsettling testimony this week suggested the latter.

As a revolt in Syria heats up with talk of U.S. intervention, Senate Armed Services Committee member Jeff Sessions stumbled upon an astounding discovery about the White House attitude toward its oath of office and putting U.S. troops in harm&apos;s way.

&quot;We spend our time worrying about the U.N., the Arab League, NATO, and too little time, my opinion, worrying about the elected representatives of the United States. As you go forward, will you consult with the United States Congress?&quot; Sessions asked Defense Secretary Leon Panetta Wednesday.

            <title>Income Inequality Myths Of Left Exposed Once Again  3.8.12</title>
            <description>Economy: The president&apos;s strategy this election year is to divide the supposedly battered 99% from the evil, super-rich 1% doing the battering. But reports of America&apos;s income inequality are greatly exaggerated.

That financial &quot;inequality&quot; gets treated as a serious issue is proof of an epidemic of economic illiteracy, since the rich do the job-generating in our economy. Now, Manhattan Institute senior fellow Diana Furchtgott-Roth has just added some essential new analysis exposing class-warfare fallacies.

Examining Labor Department data, &quot;The Myth of Increasing Income Inequality,&quot; published this week, show &quot;that inequality as measured by per-capita spending is no greater today than in it was in the 1980s.&quot;

The group Media Matters acts like a lobbyist but is not registered as one. It operates in the shadows, outside congressional oversight and unaccountable to voters.

This makes its collusion with the White House in the heat of a presidential race a serious matter worthy of investigation.

            <title>Obama Energy Hypocrisy: What&apos;s It All About, Algae?  3.8.12</title>
            <description>Energy: At a plant that makes natural-gas-powered trucks, the president proposes still more alternative-energy subsidies. The privately developed technology that lowered the price of natural gas can lower gasoline prices too.

It was a tad surreal to see President Obama, champion of green energy and unions, visiting a foreign-owned manufacturer of natural gas-powered trucks in a right-to-work state. But there he was Wednesday, at the Daimler Trucks North America truck factory in Mount Holly, N.C., touting vehicles powered by a fossil fuel produced by drilling.

The president, who recently touted pond scum as an energy source of the future, embraced the cleanest-burning of fossil fuels at a campaign stop in a state he carried in 2008 by just 14,000 votes. As he did, he announced another billion-dollar subsidy for the development of fuel-efficient technologies and vehicles.

            <title>Romney&apos;s Wealth Helps Him Make His Case For Top Job  3.7.12</title>
            <description>Wealth And Politics: The GOP front-runner&apos;s money is a sign of his success and competence. Do voters really want another president who has earned and accomplished little?

After another good-but-not-great night on Super Tuesday, Mitt Romney faces more hard slogging before he can close the deal and clinch the Republican nomination. So goes the conventional chat, and there&apos;s some truth to it.

Romney still has to put a couple of issues to rest before he can put this race away. One has to do with his views: Are they in sync with the party? The other is about his money: Is he too rich to connect with regular folks?

The first of these is a legitimate question — for any candidate, not just for Romney.

The second is not. If anything, it&apos;s a symptom of envy, a deep-rooted disorder in American politics.

Sometimes envy is out there for all to see, as in the Occupy Wall Street creed of taxing the rich to raise up the 99%.

            <title>Greedy Unions Raid Pensions, Then Blame Wall Street   3.7.12</title>
            <description>Politics: Reports from a variety of media reveal California state employees are spiking their pensions to stratospheric levels, leaving nothing for their brother employees. Sorry, can&apos;t blame Wall Street for this one.

In a laudable instance of the mainstream media doing its job, the Los Angeles Times, the Sacramento Bee, Bloomberg News and City Journal have all exposed &quot;pension spiking&quot; by California public employees. Basically, they manipulate rigid unionized pay and promotion systems to raise their pensions well above what they earned during their working years.

The Los Angeles Times on Saturday pieced together tough-to-get data from Kern and Ventura counties and found a fiscal horror story: In Kern, 77% of public employees with pensions greater than $100,000 actually get more than they did during their working lives.

In Ventura, the figure is 84%. Kern has a $761 million pension shortfall, in part due to the practice.

Both the practice and the lack of transparency are signs of a rotten system. Bigger counties like San Diego and Los Angeles also permit pension spiking.

But L.A. asked the Times to fork over $63,000 for &quot;research&quot; or they won&apos;t reveal a thing. Seems it doesn&apos;t bother these bureaucrats to pay out the spiked cash, but knowing how much it is is too much of a bother.

            <title>Syrian Freedom Fighters Find They Can&apos;t Depend On U.S.   3.7.12</title>
            <description>Mideast: Syria&apos;s terror-spreading Bashar Assad is staying put, using &quot;heavier and heavier weapons on his people,&quot; according to the U.S. military. Now Syrian freedom fighters, like Iran&apos;s, know they can&apos;t depend on America.

Forces of President Assad&apos;s terrorist client state in Syria are &quot;gaining physical momentum on the battlefield,&quot; in a state of affairs that &quot;will get worse before it gets better,&quot; according to Marine Gen. James Mattis, Centcom commander and chief U.S. military official in the Middle East.

Appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, Mattis warned that Assad &quot;is going to be there for some time because&quot; he is getting more brutal toward his countrymen.

With more than 7,500 Syrians already slaughtered, what about intervention by the U.S. and our allies? That would mean facing &quot;very advanced, integrated&quot; missile-radar defenses, Mattis noted, supplied to Syria by those post-Cold War new friends of ours in Moscow. Setting up a no-fly zone to help anti-regime forces would be tough, the general said.

Weapons and personnel have also been sent to Assad by Tehran, which Mattis says includes teams that help the Damascus regime use eavesdropping to identify and squash Syrian opposition groups.

Somehow, &quot;the Arab Awakening unfolded in Egypt unlike how it&apos;s unfolding in Syria,&quot; Mattis said.

            <title>Obama To Give Missile Secrets To Russia With Love?  3.7.12</title>
            <description>Security: A deputy defense secretary tells Congress that the administration is indeed considering giving Moscow sensitive Aegis ballistic missile defense data. We&apos;ve gone from &quot;trust but verify&quot; to &quot;appease and surrender.&quot;

Brad Roberts testified before a House Armed Services subcommittee Tuesday that the Obama administration was actively considering giving Moscow classified missile defense data to allay Russian concerns about the capabilities and intent of our proposed ballistic missile defense system based in Europe to guard against missiles launched from Iran.

Roberts testified that the administration believes &quot;cooperation could be well-served by some limited sharing of classified information of a certain kind if the proper rules were in place to do that.&quot; The Bush administration also sought cooperation on missile defense, he noted.

The only thing President George W. Bush wanted to share with the Russians was a heads-up on our plans to deploy long-range, ground-based interceptors, such as those deployed in California and Alaska, in Poland as well as missile defense radar in the Czech Republic.

He certainly wasn&apos;t offering them data such as the burnout velocity of Raytheon Co.&apos;s Standard Missile-3 interceptors, the centerpiece of our Aegis ballistic missile defense system.

            <title>China Rushes To Fill America&apos;s Military Vacuum    3.6.12</title>
            <description>Defense: Beijing announces another double-digit jump in military spending as the U.S. disarms and sacrifices its defense budget on the altar of entitlement spending. We have many duties; the Chinese have but one target.

China announced this week that its military budget this year would rise 11.2% on top of a 12.7% increase last year. This does not bode well as the U.S. defense budget and force levels decline as a result of cuts mandated by our failure to come to grips with runaway spending.

As China ramps up military spending, President Obama&apos;s budget contains $487 billion in cuts that, when added to the half-trillion or so in cuts mandated by the sequestration process, leaves us a military with a precipitately declining capability to meet its global commitments and responsibilities.

            <description>Journalism: The president&apos;s Rolodex of radicals has grown even fatter after bloggers revealed fresh details about his earlier ties to socialists. Yet the major media continue to keep a lid on it.

Last month, a former Marxist professor recounted a politically explosive tete-a-tete he had with Obama when he was a college student.

In his first-hand account, posted on AmericanThinker.com, John C. Drew, a Ph.D., said Obama expressed &quot;doctrinaire&quot; Marxist views, including the need for a new socialist U.S. government that would redistribute the nation&apos;s wealth.

            <description>Politics: President Obama is in deep trouble. To enforce ObamaCare, he&apos;s gotten into a war on freedom of conscience and a confrontation with the Catholic Church. So now he&apos;s trying to make it all about something a radio host said.

The controversy surrounding Georgetown University law student and activist Sandra Fluke, who informally testified to Congress last week, is that she and other students have a right to &quot;free&quot; birth control pills as part of their insurance plans even if their Catholic university opposes it as a violation of its fundamental religious principles.

Radio commentator Rush Limbaugh dished some rough criticism of her stance — correctly pointing out that it amounted to an absurd entitlement for voluntary lifestyle choices that had nothing to do with health care — but then went overboard by personalizing the issue, calling Fluke a &quot;slut&quot; and other bad names.

            <description>National Security: President Obama criticizes Republican candidates for their &quot;casualness&quot; in urging force to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. But who&apos;s really been &quot;casual&quot; about Tehran&apos;s threat?

Iran sure knows how to play the American fiddle. Its official ISNA news agency has announced Iran will give U.N. inspectors access to the Parchin nuclear facility as an act of &quot;goodwill.&quot;

Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council says Iran has agreed to more talks about its nuclear program.

            <itunes:summary>National Security: President Obama criticizes Republican candidates for their &quot;casualness&quot; in urging force to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. But who&apos;s really been &quot;casual&quot; about Tehran&apos;s threat?

Iran sure knows how to play the American fiddle. Its official ISNA news agency has announced Iran will give U.N. inspectors access to the Parchin nuclear facility as an act of &quot;goodwill.&quot;

Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council says Iran has agreed to more talks about its nuclear program.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Veteran Families Should Cry to Obama, Not Romney    3.6.12</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: Mitt Romney last weekend was faced with emotional cries for help from veterans&apos; families. Their frustrations should be directed at the president who is shortchanging vets and gutting our defenses.

&apos;You say you won&apos;t cut benefits for any of those heroes who are returning,&quot; Michael O&apos;Machearley of Wilmington, Ohio, whose son was killed in Iraq, said to Romney during Mike Huckabee&apos;s Fox News candidate forum in Atlanta on Saturday. Then he asked, &quot;Will you increase them?&quot;

Romney didn&apos;t address boosting government-funded veterans&apos; assistance. But meeting with vets in South Carolina several months ago he floated a real solution — &quot;private-sector competition&quot; in which &quot;each soldier gets x-thousand dollars attributed to them, and then they can choose whether they want to go on the government system or the private system and then it follows them,&quot; as in Florida&apos;s school voucher program.

            <title>Too Many Volts, Not Enough Buyers, Especially At That Price    3.5.12</title>
            <description>Government Failure: Chevrolet is shutting down production of the Volt, its electric car. Not even generous federal subsidies are enough to keep this trendy environmentalist flop on the road.

General Motors announced late last week that it will discontinue making its plug-in hybrid between March 19 until April 23 &quot;to keep proper inventory levels.&quot;

In other words, it can&apos;t sell enough of the darned things to justify continued production.

Through the end of February, Chevrolet had sold a mere 1,626 Volts though it had planned to build 60,000 of them this year and sell 45,000 in the U.S. market.

            <title>Democrats In California Declare War On Farmers    3.5.12</title>
            <description>Politics: To leftist food scolds, eating more vegetables is important. So why are California&apos;s two Democratic senators having a cow about a water bill that would let their Central Valley&apos;s farmers grow more veggies?

House Republican Devin Nunes&apos; Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Water Relief Act (H.R. 1837), which passed easily in the House last week, was the first standalone bill to address the persistent problem of arbitrary state decisions to deny water to the farmers of the Central Valley. It&apos;s a good bill.

But not to the more obtuse Democrats.

            <title>Look Who Paul Krugman&apos;s Calling a Keynesian Now    3.5.12</title>
            <description>Stimulus: We&apos;ve come to expect the worst from unduly influential New York Times columnist Paul Krugman. But this week he hit a new low by claiming President Reagan, not Obama, is the true big-government Keynesian.

In his column, Krugman argues the only reason the economy continues to suffer is that Obama isn&apos;t spending money fast enough, or running deficits big enough. With interest rates at record lows, he says, we should be borrowing more money to spur growth.

This is nothing new for Krugman. But to make his case this time around, he tries to draft Reagan into his Keynesian army. Reagan&apos;s recovery was so much better than Obama&apos;s, Krugman says, only because &quot;Reagan was much more Keynesian than Mr. Obama.&quot;

            <title>Does Obama Really Have Israel&apos;s Back On Iran?    3.5.12</title>
            <description>Mideast: When it comes to Israel&apos;s coming nuclear conflict with Iran, President Obama has told our ally, &quot;I have your back.&quot; But given the president&apos;s sorry track record, Israel is right to be skeptical.

The president certainly sounded tough when he spoke to AIPAC Sunday. &quot;We will do what it takes,&quot; he told the pro-Israel group, &quot;to preserve Israel&apos;s qualitative military edge — because Israel must always have the ability to defend itself, by itself, against any threat.&quot;

Nothing, he said, is &quot;off the table&quot; when it comes to responding to Iran&apos;s nuclear threat. Nothing. Obama was just as tough when he spoke Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, reportedly repeating that &quot;the U.S. has Israel&apos;s back.&quot;

            <title>Obama&apos;s Answer For High Gas Prices Is Class Warfare   3.2.12</title>
            <description>Energy: President Obama&apos;s election-year prescription to accelerate steeply higher energy prices is to add billions of dollars to the oil companies&apos; tax bills. Expensive gasoline fits the Obama political template.

&apos;Every time you fill up the gas tank, they&apos;re making money.&quot; That applause line, delivered Thursday by the president from Nashua, N.H., speaks volumes about the thinking that lies at the root of this presidency.

Resentment against the successful is what Barack Obama wants to cultivate among Americans, dividing the dependents of the government, who pay no income taxes to fund it, against the nation&apos;s private-sector producers, who finance the state&apos;s dependency machine by paying the vast bulk of the income taxes.

Fed up with prices at your local gas station going up, up and away, past the $4 level toward $5 and even higher? The president says you should take out your frustration by telling Congress to end the perfectly reasonable oil-and-gas industry tax deductions on drilling costs and other technical aspects of production.

House Speaker John Boehner was quick to respond that &quot;a freshman-year economics student could tell you that increasing taxes on energy production would make gas prices go up, not down.&quot; But Obama&apos;s crass appeal to baser instincts has nothing to do with economics — or solving problems — and everything to do with politics.

            <title>ObamaCare Is Designed To End Private Insurers  3.2.12</title>
            <description>Government: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says that private health insurance providers are in a &quot;death spiral.&quot; Of course they are. Isn&apos;t that the way the authors of ObamaCare planned it?

Testifying last Wednesday in front of the House Ways and Means Committee, Sebelius was asked by Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., if the administration was being honest when President Obama promised that those who liked their health plans could keep them.

Said Sebelius: &quot;The private market is in a death spiral.&quot;

Sebelius tried to temper her comment by claiming the private insurance market would collapse even if the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act had not been passed. But the truth is, the market cannot survive under the growing weight of government, and Obama-Care was to be the final heavy load that will crush it.

Don&apos;t believe it? Look at the provisions of ObamaCare and consider them in context with the Democrats&apos; constant public demonization of insurers.

Start with the mandates. By now, most of the country knows that ObamaCare requires health insurers to pay for contraception and other birth-control measures. But that&apos;s not the law&apos;s only mandate. Among the many diktats of the Democrats&apos; health care overhaul is the requirement that insurers must spend at least 80 cents on medical claims for every $1 they take in from premiums in the individual and small group markets, and 85 cents from premiums in the large group market.

            <title>U.N. Seeks Sweeping Power To Control Food, Water  3.2.12</title>
            <description>Resources: A new report suggests the United Nations take control of the world&apos;s food and water. We&apos;d write this off as a joke except the Obama administration seems to like the idea of global government.

Putting life&apos;s essentials under the direct control of perhaps the most corrupt organization on earth doesn&apos;t strike us as wise. But that&apos;s what a new U.N. report, &quot;21 Issues for the 21st Century,&quot; would do.

It suggests &quot;international protocols&quot; and a &quot;shared vision&quot; for land and water use that would, essentially, end current national laws and treaties governing their use.

Perhaps we shouldn&apos;t be surprised. Just two months ago, the U.N. suggested a &quot;minimum global tax,&quot; and the idea was immediately embraced by some in the Obama administration as a good idea. It&apos;s not.

Still, this utopian notion of &quot;one-world government&quot; dies hard. Even though the United Nations has been found to be financially corrupt and almost entirely ineffective, it continues to seek new, sweeping powers.

The 192 member-countries that make up the U.N. see these sweeping new powers to tax us, tell us what food to grow and whom to sell it to, and to give up our rights to our own water as a way to bring the mighty U.S. under the world&apos;s heel. They envy our wealth and clout.

President Obama has made it clear throughout his presidency that he doesn&apos;t see the U.S. as an exceptional nation, just one of many. That&apos;s where the problem begins, since it emboldens the bureaucrats and thieves who run the U.N. to come up with these kinds of ideas.

            <itunes:subtitle>Resources: A new report suggests the United Nations take control of the world&apos;s food and water. We&apos;d write this off as a joke except the Obama administration seems to like the idea of global government.</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Resources: A new report suggests the United Nations take control of the world&apos;s food and water. We&apos;d write this off as a joke except the Obama administration seems to like the idea of global government.

Putting life&apos;s essentials under the direct control of perhaps the most corrupt organization on earth doesn&apos;t strike us as wise. But that&apos;s what a new U.N. report, &quot;21 Issues for the 21st Century,&quot; would do.

It suggests &quot;international protocols&quot; and a &quot;shared vision&quot; for land and water use that would, essentially, end current national laws and treaties governing their use.

Perhaps we shouldn&apos;t be surprised. Just two months ago, the U.N. suggested a &quot;minimum global tax,&quot; and the idea was immediately embraced by some in the Obama administration as a good idea. It&apos;s not.

Still, this utopian notion of &quot;one-world government&quot; dies hard. Even though the United Nations has been found to be financially corrupt and almost entirely ineffective, it continues to seek new, sweeping powers.

The 192 member-countries that make up the U.N. see these sweeping new powers to tax us, tell us what food to grow and whom to sell it to, and to give up our rights to our own water as a way to bring the mighty U.S. under the world&apos;s heel. They envy our wealth and clout.

President Obama has made it clear throughout his presidency that he doesn&apos;t see the U.S. as an exceptional nation, just one of many. That&apos;s where the problem begins, since it emboldens the bureaucrats and thieves who run the U.N. to come up with these kinds of ideas.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama&apos;s &apos;Trust&apos; In Americans Doesn’t Include Health Care   3.2.12</title>
            <description>Medicare: President Obama routinely says he trusts the American people. But when push comes to shove, he always puts his faith in Washington bureaucrats. Case in point is the battle over how to control Medicare costs.

Last Wednesday, a House subcommittee voted to kill Obama&apos;s favored approach to Medicare reform — an unaccountable board of 15 presidential appointees granted virtually unlimited power to cut Medicare spending to meet ObamaCare-imposed annual spending caps.

Two Democrats joined 15 Republicans on the committee to kill the board, including the ranking Democrat on the committee, New Jersey&apos;s Rep. Frank Pallone. With 227 co-sponsors — among them 17 Democrats — the repeal measure is certain to win approval in the House.

And for good reason. Under ObamaCare, the so-called Independent Payment Advisory Board would, starting in 2015, have the authority to dictate spending cuts to meet increasingly stringent annual Medicare annual budget caps, without congressional oversight or input, or the threat of legal challenges.

            <title>Unions Detest Them, But Teacher Ratings Here To Stay  3.1.12</title>
            <description>Education: Unions rail against releasing performance data on teachers, but the trend in reform is not on their side. Ability can be measured, and parents should know the results.

What makes a good teacher, seniority and credentials or the ability to impart knowledge and skills? The answer should be obvious, but only recently has it made its way into public policy.

Rating teachers by how well they actually teach, which strikes us as nothing more than common sense, has turned out to be hugely controversial. And if anyone dares reveal this data to parents, the unions go nuclear.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Green Energy Failures Continue To Abound  3.1.12</title>
            <description>Green Energy: Another stimulus-backed solar panel maker, one the president touted in a weekly radio address, lays off most of its workers. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result.

President Obama is the Little Orphan Annie of presidents. He is always singing that the sun will come out tomorrow and shine on the American economy and his dreams of green energy. Yet companies such as Solyndra have proved the rule rather than the exception, producing more pink slips than green jobs as solar power and alternative energy continue to be eclipsed by advances in fossil fuel production.

The latest casualty is Abound Solar Manufacturing. The Longmont, Colo.-based recipient of a $400 million federal loan guarantee to expand solar panel production said Tuesday it is laying off 280 workers and delaying a new factory in Indiana. That amounts to a 70% reduction in its workforce.

            <description>Passion For Truth: The sudden death of journalist-activist-media entrepreneur Andrew Breitbart is a huge blow to the American conservative movement. The truth has lost one of its most zealous guardians.

News of Breitbart&apos;s death hit us like a punch to the gut. Some of us at IBD knew him well, and his untimely death leaves a large personal and professional void.

How do you sum up someone as full of life and ideas and passion? Breitbart was a digital media pioneer, helping create both Drudge Report and the Huffington Post, as well as his own Big Journalism, Big Government and Breitbart.com websites. But that stack of work doesn&apos;t define him. Not even close.

            <description>Regulation: Every time government tries to make something more &quot;affordable&quot; for consumers, it makes it more unaffordable. Soaring college tuition is just the latest example.

After creating housing and medical bubbles in the name of &quot;affordability,&quot; Washington now wants to make college more affordable. How? By subsidizing it even more.

Yet new studies show federal student aid is what&apos;s pushing college costs up faster than inflation — faster than even health care costs.

            <title>Pakistan, India May Reap Peace From Free Trade Deal   2.29.12</title>
            <description>Free Trade: Is an end to the nonstop conflict between India and Pakistan in sight? A big free-trade agreement between the two Asian giants by the end of the year might just be the peace tonic both countries need.

It was Frederic de Bastiat, the great French libertarian philosopher, who reportedly said: &quot;When goods don&apos;t travel across borders, soldiers will.&quot;

That certainly describes Pakistan and India, two nuclear-armed nations at each other&apos;s throats since the colonial partition of 1948 that left the culturally similar countries with barely any trade.

But Wednesday that picture changed dramatically as the two nations announced that a free trade deal would go into full effect by the end of the year, ending decades of closed markets, bureaucratic red tape and economy-shriveling protectionism.

The World Bank believes the pact will raise the two rivals&apos; small $2 billion in annual trade fivefold to $10 billion a year. That may be low, since India&apos;s and Pakistan&apos;s businesses already trade that much off the books.

Some $10 billion in two-way India-Pakistan trade already goes on through neutral ports like Dubai — with the transport costs for the detour driving up prices.

            <title>Soccer For Jihadists, Higher Premiums For Troops   2.29.12</title>
            <description>Priorities: Veterans of the war on terror will be rewarded with higher insurance premiums that favored unions are exempt from. Obama-Care must be served, after all, and that soccer field for Gitmo detainees must be paid for.

For the soldiers who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and lost their legs from mines and improvised explosive devices, it is bitterly ironic news that detainees at Guantanamo, who helped maim them, will now be kicking around soccer balls at a new $750,000 field that is half the size of an American football field.

This comes as the military is bearing the brunt of budget cuts and U.S. servicemen are being murdered in Afghanistan for burning Qurans already desecrated by the writings of other jihadist prisoners. No doubt surviving families of our war dead are wondering when their kids&apos; schools will get new soccer fields.

The Gitmo project began in April 2011 and is due to finish this spring. Detainees will now have three recreation facilities at Camp 6, including already existing indoor and outdoor recreation fields. Not bad for a facility that candidate Barack Obama pledged to close on day one of his term.

            <title>Mad About High Gas Prices? Then Chu On This   2.29.12</title>
            <description>Gasoline: As pump prices hit $4 a gallon, Energy Secretary Steven Chu admits the administration has no interest in bringing them down. Is it any wonder Democrats are growing increasingly agitated with this White House?

At a hearing this week, Rep. Alan Nunnelee, R-Miss., specifically asked Chu if &quot;the overall goal&quot; of the administration is to &quot;get our price down.&quot; Chu&apos;s answer was no.

In fact, he said that &quot;somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,&quot; which are in the neighborhood of $8 a gallon.

No, wait. That&apos;s what Chu said about gasoline prices back in 2008, shortly before he took the Energy Department&apos;s helm. What he really said was &quot;the price of gasoline over the long haul should be expected to go up.&quot;

Oops! That&apos;s what Chu said last year when asked about gasoline prices. Here&apos;s his answer: He &quot;would have preferred a gradual increase&quot; in prices.

            <itunes:summary>Gasoline: As pump prices hit $4 a gallon, Energy Secretary Steven Chu admits the administration has no interest in bringing them down. Is it any wonder Democrats are growing increasingly agitated with this White House?

At a hearing this week, Rep. Alan Nunnelee, R-Miss., specifically asked Chu if &quot;the overall goal&quot; of the administration is to &quot;get our price down.&quot; Chu&apos;s answer was no.

In fact, he said that &quot;somehow we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in Europe,&quot; which are in the neighborhood of $8 a gallon.

No, wait. That&apos;s what Chu said about gasoline prices back in 2008, shortly before he took the Energy Department&apos;s helm. What he really said was &quot;the price of gasoline over the long haul should be expected to go up.&quot;

Oops! That&apos;s what Chu said last year when asked about gasoline prices. Here&apos;s his answer: He &quot;would have preferred a gradual increase&quot; in prices.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Bernanke Fed&apos;s Ease: Insurance Against Incompetence?   2.29.12</title>
            <description>Economy: Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke strongly hinted he&apos;ll keep monetary policy easy, despite 3% economic growth in 2011&apos;s fourth quarter. Does he know something that we don&apos;t about this economy?

As we&apos;ve noted, it&apos;s very suspicious the nation&apos;s top central banker would keep such an easy monetary policy even as the economy grows.

Does the Fed chief think the economy is more fragile than it appears? Or is he just so concerned about the economic policy ineptitude of the Obama White House that he doesn&apos;t dare alter the most stimulative Fed policy in history?

At this point, it may be a bit of both. On the surface, things don&apos;t seem so bad. According to the latest revision, GDP grew at a 3% rate in the fourth quarter, a little higher than the 2.8% estimate made in January.

The official unemployment rate has edged down to 8.3%, while the Dow industrial average closed above 13,000 Tuesday for the first time since 2008. Consumer confidence — including our own IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index — is on the rise.

On Wednesday, Bernanke himself lauded what he called &quot;positive developments in the labor market.&quot;

            <description>Mideast: During their brutally suppressed protests in 2009, Iranian freedom fighters sent the White House an urgent memo calling for help. Under Obama, America ignored it.

&apos;So now, at this pivotal point in time, it is up to the countries of the free world to make up their mind,&quot; Iranian opposition leaders told the Obama administration in an eight-page memo in 2009. &quot;Will they continue on the track of wishful thinking and push every decision to the future until it is too late, or will they reward the brave people of Iran and simultaneously advance the Western interests and world peace.&quot;

President Obama made his choice, and like so often before it was to vote &quot;present.&quot;

            <description>Madness: Bradley Manning, the Army private who allegedly leaked sensitive U.S. government information, has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. If the award hadn&apos;t already become a joke, we&apos;d be offended.

It really doesn&apos;t take much to be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize these days. Bradley, who is currently in the brig and on trial for multiple counts of disclosing top-secret military files and State Department cables, is one of 231 nominees for the 2012 prize.

            <description>First Amendment: The ex-head of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops compares the administration take on freedom of worship to the Soviet Union&apos;s and says its contraceptive mandate will force church hospitals to close.

On the first Sunday of Lent, Chicago&apos;s Francis Cardinal George issued his version of the letter issued by the USCCB he recently led.

It shredded assurances by the administration that things could be worked out so that religious freedom would not be impaired and painted a bleak future that just might be the administration&apos;s intent.

            <title>Oil King Hugo Chavez Will Leave Venezuela In Chaos  2.28.12</title>
            <description>Americas: Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez may be on his last legs, as news of his hasty flight to Cuba for more cancer surgery suggests. While welcome here, his exit may mean chaos ahead for a top U.S. oil supplier.

The apparent metastasizing of Chavez&apos;s cancer couldn&apos;t come at a worse time for the socialist strongman. Coming just seven months before his biggest electoral challenge — one he may lose to Henrique Radonski Capriles even without the debilitation of cancer — it&apos;s safe to say he&apos;d be unable to campaign even if he survives.

            <description>Prices And Politics: Most of the 99% feel real pain when they pay $4 a gallon at the pump. But the more fortunate just tell them to move or buy a Prius. Gee, thanks for the advice.

Nothing quite divides the elites from regular working folks like a spike in the price of gasoline. To the latter, it&apos;s a blow to the household budget. To the former, it&apos;s a teachable moment.

The lesson always seems to be twofold. One theme is that there&apos;s no fighting higher gas prices. The other is that there is plenty you can do to adjust and, in the process, help build a better world.

            <description>Politics: Is sanity finally coming to California&apos;s Central Valley? America&apos;s breadbasket has long been victim of capricious water cutoffs to &quot;save&quot; the environment. A bill in Congress puts an end to this man-made drought. It should pass.

Rep. Devin Nunes of Visalia, Calif., has come forward with a legislative remedy for the policies that have turned fertile fields into hollowed-out dust bowls in the name of &quot;being green.&quot;

Nunes&apos; Sacramento-San Joaquin Water Reliability Act goes to a vote in the House Wednesday and if it passes, it will guarantee that water the farmers paid for finally gets to the parched Central Valley. It will put an end to the sorry stream of shriveled vineyards, blackened almond groves and unemployed farm workers standing in alms lines for bagged carrots from China.

            <description>Defense: Pilots who arrived a year ago to train on the fighter of the future are still waiting as safety concerns, cost overruns and questions about the whole program&apos;s feasibility mount.

The F-35 is meant to be America&apos;s next-generation fighter, the heir to the Air Force&apos;s F-15 Eagle and the Navy&apos;s and Marines&apos; F/A-18 Hornet. Those two aircraft have fulfilled their air superiority and ground-attack roles well, yet many are well beyond their expected life expectancy.

The F-35 would fill America&apos;s defense needs in an age of budget constraints, we were told. So far it has not been a smooth takeoff.

            <description>War On Terror: As the Taliban assassinate U.S. military officers and poison troop chow in Afghanistan, the president secretly plans the release of Taliban prisoners from Gitmo.

Whose side is this commander in chief on? Just days before members of the Taliban took credit for infiltrating the Afghan Interior Ministry and murdering two American officers, the Obama administration was finalizing a secret deal with the terror group.

&quot;If all goes as hoped,&quot; reported Reuters, &quot;U.S. and Qatari negotiators will meet soon to nail down final details for transferring Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo prison — a momentous step for President Obama, the Afghan war and perhaps U.S. foreign policy as well.&quot;

            <description>Energy: The White House billed President Obama&apos;s energy policy speech as a response to mounting criticism of record high gas prices. What he delivered was a grab bag of excuses and outright falsehoods.

Obama&apos;s main message to struggling motorists was: It&apos;s not my fault, so stop whining. The speech only got worse from there, recycling excuses and myths that Obama&apos;s peddled for years. But there were some standout whoppers that deserve debunking. The five biggest:

            <title>Growing Solyndra Green Scandal Is Just One of Many&quot;   2.23.12</title>
            <description>Corruption: Outrageous bonuses and White House stonewalling guarantee that the Solyndra scandal, in which betting on green lost taxpayers $535 million, won&apos;t go away. But Solyndra is no isolated failure.

gjngWith 24 million Americans either without any job or underemployed, and 7 million claiming jobless benefits, the latest Solyndra news of wasted stimulus funds and noncooperation with Congress is sure to make taxpayers&apos; blood boil.

Nearly two dozen employees of the solar panel maker that got a $535 million federal loan guarantee shortly before bankruptcy got $368,500 in bonuses Wednesday from a federal bankruptcy judge — in spite of the company failing to disclose it gave several of the raises of as much as 70% months earlier, after it went bankrupt.

            <title>Revenue Falls When Wealthy British Pay Their &quot;Fair Share&quot;&quot;   2.23.12</title>
            <description>Tax Policy: The British government introduced a higher tax rate on the rich in 2010, promising that it would bring in added revenue. But, as any sensible person could have guessed, just the opposite has happened.

Gordon Brown&apos;s Labour Party government launched the 50% rate in income taxes allegedly as a means to bring in more revenue.

The London Telegraph reported earlier this year that Her Majesty&apos;s Revenue and Customs estimated the British version of the Buffett Tax would &quot;show a &apos;surge&apos; in revenues totaling hundreds of millions of pounds from the first year.&quot;

            <description>Energy: Industry leaders gathered in Houston say rising fuel output comes in spite of, not because of, the president&apos;s policies and the pain at the pump will soon be excruciating.

Energy executives and other industry players gathered for the North American Prospect Expo (NAPE) in Houston shredded administration assertions that it is opening up areas for oil and gas exploration and that its policies are responsible for increased oil and gas production on President Obama&apos;s watch.

&quot;These have been the most difficult three years from a policy standpoint that I&apos;ve ever seen in my career,&quot; Bruce Vincent, president of Houston oil and natural gas producer Swift Energy, told the Houston Chronicle.

            <description>Fannie And Freddie: Key players in the subprime bubble continue to run up bills for the taxpayers. The latest outrage is a $100 million-plus tab for defending executives in fraud cases.

Say what you will about the big banks and the wisdom of propping them up with federal money back in 2008.

The fact is, their time at the trough has come and gone. The Treasury has actually turned a bit of a profit — $13 billion — from the funds it injected into the banking sector.

            <description>Election 2012: Normally a president&apos;s faith is a personal, not political, matter and should be left alone. But Obama&apos;s faith dictates his political agenda, and therefore is fair game as a campaign issue.

GOP presidential front-runner Rick Santorum did not go &quot;well over the line,&quot; as the White House howled, when he questioned Obama&apos;s faith during a recent speech. He didn&apos;t go far enough.

Santorum said Obama practices a &quot;phony theology&quot; not based on the Bible. He said it&apos;s tied to his agenda and led by &quot;radicals&quot; like the Rev. Jeremiah Wright.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Last-Minute, Cynical Tax-Reform Ploy  2.22.12</title>
            <description>Taxes: President Obama is dressing up his corporate tax reform plan as a way to boost economic growth. But you don&apos;t have to look hard to see this for what it is: a brazenly cynical attempt to boost his re-election chances.

In announcing Obama&apos;s tax reform &quot;framework&quot; — which would lower the corporate rate to 28% and close loopholes — Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner tried to depict it as a genuine effort to improve the economy.

&quot;We think there&apos;s a compelling economic case&quot; for corporate tax reform, he told Congress last week.

On Wednesday, he added the current system is &quot;bad for economic growth and job creation&quot; and that reform would &quot;make us more competitive and create jobs here at home&quot; and &quot;boost growth.&quot;

There&apos;s no question we desperately need corporate tax reform. The current code trades a too-high rate of 35% — the OECD average rate is 25% and falling — for a myriad of loopholes that distort business decisions and dampen growth. The resulting tax law is so monstrously complex that businesses spend up to $85 billion a year just to figure out what they owe.

            <title>El Paso Shooting Proves U.S.&apos; Weak Border Security 2.22.12</title>
            <description>Border: It&apos;s happened. A resident of El Paso, Texas, was struck by a bullet from embattled Mexico in the latest sign of war spillover. Is this what Janet Napolitano meant by our border safety being &quot;better than ever&quot;?

&apos;There is a perception that the border is worse now than it&apos;s ever been,&quot; said Napolitano, dismissing concerns about border security from El Paso itself less than a year ago last March. &quot;That is wrong. The border is better now than it has ever been.&quot;

Napolitano, like a lot of Obama administration officials, was pretending there wasn&apos;t a problem on the border. But it just keeps getting worse.

When Napolitano spoke a year ago in El Paso, she dismissed the fact that a year earlier, bullets fired by Mexico&apos;s cartel gunmen had hit El Paso&apos;s City Hall, and then the University of Texas. The events were downplayed as anomalies because there were no casualties.

Well, now there are casualties. Pushing a baby stroller as she shopped in downtown El Paso, Maria Romero, 48, was hit in the leg by a .223 caliber bullet from a high-powered rifle. By all indications it came from a shootout in Juarez, the cartel-plagued murder capital that has seen 9,000 dead bodies in its streets in the last four years as 200,000 of its citizens have fled the violence.

Napolitano, like a lot of Obama administration officials, was pretending there wasn&apos;t a problem on the border. But it just keeps getting worse.

When Napolitano spoke a year ago in El Paso, she dismissed the fact that a year earlier, bullets fired by Mexico&apos;s cartel gunmen had hit El Paso&apos;s City Hall, and then the University of Texas. The events were downplayed as anomalies because there were no casualties.

Well, now there are casualties. Pushing a baby stroller as she shopped in downtown El Paso, Maria Romero, 48, was hit in the leg by a .223 caliber bullet from a high-powered rifle. By all indications it came from a shootout in Juarez, the cartel-plagued murder capital that has seen 9,000 dead bodies in its streets in the last four years as 200,000 of its citizens have fled the violence.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama&apos;s &apos;1984&apos;-Speak, Unemployment Is A Plus  2.22.12</title>
            <description>Economy: Failed presidents always come up with excuses, but Obama spinmeister Valerie Jarrett has repeated a White House ploy that takes the cake. In true &quot;1984&quot; style, she says bad times are really good.

One of George Orwell&apos;s most chilling images was that of a totalitarian government that succeeded in convincing people their oppressed existence was the opposite of what it was.

&quot;War is Peace,&quot; the ruling party insisted in Orwell&apos;s novel 1984, &quot;Freedom is Slavery&quot; and &quot;Ignorance is Strength.&quot;

On Tuesday evening, speaking in Durham, N.C., White House adviser and close Chicago friend of the Obamas Valerie Jarrett took the argument that government spending is &quot;good for the economy&quot; to a new level.

Referring to unemployment benefits, Jarrett contended that &quot;people who receive that unemployment check go out and spend it and help stimulate the economy,&quot; which is &quot;healthy&quot; for the economy.

Being such an insult to the millions of Americans now seeking work, Jarrett&apos;s claim has attracted plenty of attention. But it&apos;s nothing new for this White House.

            <description>Election &apos;12: As the Michigan primary nears, Mitt Romney is being sneered at for opposing Washington&apos;s &quot;successful&quot; bailout of Detroit. Wednesday night&apos;s debate gives him a golden chance to explain why he was right.

The establishment media have been echoing Democratic Party talking points and telling America that our big-spending president saved the U.S. auto industry.

And that GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney got it all wrong in a post-2008 election New York Times Op-Ed that editors titled &quot;Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.&quot;

            <description>Energy: The left thought it found in fracking the leverage it could use to further hinder domestic oil and gas production. But fracking isn&apos;t an environmental cataclysm. An independent university report confirms this.

Fear of fracking, a process used to draw fossil fuels from shale, is based in part on speculation that it harms drinking water.

Opponents say the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing taint groundwater.

Researchers at the University of Texas, however, say they have &quot;found no direct evidence that fracking itself has contaminated groundwater.&quot;

            <description>Energy: When gas prices hit $4 a gallon in 2008, candidate Barack Obama said it was due to previous failed energy policies. Now that prices are heading still higher, President Obama calls it progress.

Already, pump prices are higher than they&apos;ve been in previous years, suggesting they will top $4 soon and possibly reach an unprecedented $5 this summer.

President Obama is starting to notice the political implications. So he sent Robert Gibbs — now a top campaign adviser — out to tell the public not to worry.

            <title>High Real Unemployment Data Reflect Poorly On Obama  2.17.12</title>
            <description>Economy: The media machine that desperately wants Barack Obama re-elected has turned its focus on what it says are good unemployment numbers. The truth, though, is the job climate in America is miserable.

While the media and the administration portray the most recent jobs number — 8.3% unemployment — as good economic news, more sober minds understand what&apos;s really going on. The facts show a jobs slump that should not get an incumbent president re-elected.

Sure, the jobless rate is falling. But according to the Congressional Budget Office, we are going through the longest stretch of high unemployment since the Depression. The rate has been higher than 8% since February 2009, the month after Obama took office.

And, says the CBO, it is expected to stay above 8% through 2014.

            <title>It Isn&apos;t Just Catholics Mad About ObamaCare Mandate   2.17.12</title>
            <description>First Amendment: This week, two non-Catholic Christian colleges are proving that Obama-Care&apos;s contraception-sterilization requirement isn&apos;t just a Catholic concern. They are suing for their religious freedoms, too.

Louisiana College, a private higher-education institution founded in 1906 and affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, will file suit in U.S. District Court on Monday to challenge the Obama administration&apos;s rule forcing employers&apos; insurers to provide free contraceptives and surgical sterilization, IBD has learned.

Another Protestant college, not yet named, will file a federal suit on the same grounds later in the week, according to the Alliance Defense Fund, the nonprofit alliance of Christian attorneys providing both colleges&apos; legal representation.

The two schools argue that the &quot;compromise&quot; President Obama announced earlier this month, forcing insurers themselves instead of religious institutions to provide the controversial services — and for free — &quot;is entirely fictitious.&quot;

            <title>Pelosi, Boxer and Judas — Obama Lied At Notre Dame  2.17.12</title>
            <description>Rights: The House Minority Leader says self-insurance is no protection against the government&apos;s contraceptive mandate, while California&apos;s junior senator says people have a right to be insured but no right to practice their faith.

Lost in the phony &quot;compromise&quot; on the Health and Human Services mandate on religious institutions being forced to pay for contraceptive services was the fact that many such institutions are self-insured. So making insurance companies pay instead is a distinction without a difference. Sometimes these religious institutions are their own insurance company.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who once complained that her fellow Catholics had this &quot;conscience thing,&quot; says it doesn&apos;t matter. At a press conference Thursday, Pelosi was asked by the Weekly Standard&apos;s John McCormack, &quot;The Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., is a self-insured institution.

&quot;Should the Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., be required to pay for these morning-after pills and birth control if they find that morally objectionable?&quot;

            <description>Defense: The new Obama budget does little to restore American sea power, which has reached lows not seen for almost a century. Who&apos;s noticing? You can bet that Beijing is.

Go to the website of the Obama administration&apos;s Office of Management and Budget, and you&apos;ll find a list of 23 links to &quot;Fact Sheets on Key Issues&quot; in the president&apos;s proposed 2013 budget. Most are about how Barack Obama&apos;s spending blueprint will benefit this or that group, from farmers and college students to seniors and &quot;the LGBT community.&quot;

Notably missing is national defense. Maybe the president just doesn&apos;t find the topic interesting.

Well, we&apos;re interested. And the American public should be interested too, because the budget fails to give the U.S. what it needs to maintain its power in a dangerous world. Nowhere is this clearer than in the spending plans for the Navy.

            <title>Obama Likes High Gasoline Prices, But Won&apos;t Admit It   2.16.12</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: If gasoline prices so far are any indication, the pain at the pump will be severe this year. But if you think President Obama cares, you&apos;re wrong. If anything, he&apos;s secretly cheering it on.

Already, average pump prices have topped $3.50 a gallon, leading some experts to think they could reach an all-time high of $5 by the summer.

So what&apos;s Obama&apos;s response? He treats it like a badge of honor, saying this week that &quot;gas prices are on the rise again because as the economy strengthens, global demand for oil increases.&quot;

            <title>Will Green-Energy Scandal Hurt Obama Chances In 2012?   2.16.12</title>
            <description>Crony Capitalism: With the election still more than eight months away, is it too soon to ask if the president can be re-elected with the green baggage piling up around him? Right now, that pile is deep — and getting deeper.

Obama&apos;s green energy scandal is more than Solyndra, the failed solar panel maker that squandered $535 million of Obama stimulus cash and hosted the president for a propaganda visit. It&apos;s a series of green-energy companies failing despite the administration&apos;s ceaseless promotion of the industry and the unseemly White House ties that run throughout.

While the legacy media often shills for Democrats, sometimes an outlet surprises us, as the Washington Post did with this week&apos;s story outlining the shady Obama links to the clean-energy industry and implying the administration has engaged in first-class corruption.

            <description>Housing Policy: The White House is taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the wrong direction. Instead of reforming the toxic mortgage twins, it&apos;s broadening their role.

Even as taxpayer losses from the failed mortgage giants mount, the administration has done nothing to address the problem except to send Congress a thin report that merely pays lip service to reforms.

&quot;You all said you all would come forth at the beginning of this year with a real proposal&quot; to reform the home-finance system, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., complained to administration officials during a bank panel hearing. &quot;The year is almost over and you have not done that.&quot;

            <title>Hot Rods From Hell: Iran Makes Its Own Nuclear Fuel   2.16.12</title>
            <description>Nuclear Proliferation: Iran loads a reactor with its first domestically produced nuclear fuel rods and announces a new high-speed centrifuge to enrich uranium. Before we kick the can again, we may be running out of road.

Iran began loading domestically made nuclear fuel rods into its Tehran research reactor on Wednesday, thumbing its nose at the threat of new sanctions on top of those that have proved ineffectual in appreciably slowing Tehran&apos;s steady march toward nuclear capability.

At a reactor in northern Tehran, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad personally oversaw the insertion of Iran&apos;s first domestically produced fuel rods enriched to 20% uranium, the official IRNA news agency reported.

            <title>GOP Trades Principle For Politics With Tax Deal   2.15.12</title>
            <description>Tax Deal: Republicans are being lauded for their political savvy in agreeing to extend the payroll tax cut and jobless benefits for another year without paying for it. Well, it may be good politics, but it&apos;s bad on principle.

If there&apos;s one thing pundits on the left and the right agree on, it&apos;s that Republicans in Congress were politically clever to deny President Obama two issues he wanted to use against the GOP: extending the two-percentage point payroll tax cut and extra jobless benefits through the end of this year.

No doubt, they&apos;re right. After all, as we&apos;ve heard repeated for decades, politics is the &quot;art of compromise.&quot;

Without action by Congress, the payroll tax cut would have expired at the end of February. Republicans knew they would be tarred by the Democrats and the mainstream media — is there really any difference? — for &quot;raising taxes&quot; on 160 million Americans when it did.

So instead of opposing it, as they did last year, the GOP went along with Democrats to extend it.

&quot;The payroll tax cut is political candy,&quot; Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. correctly observed Wednesday. &quot;Once you hand it out, it&apos;s hard to take it back.&quot;

            <title>Federal Workers Need To Be Part Of The Shared Sacrifice   2.15.12</title>
            <description>Campaigning: The Obama budget is a miserably flawed document in so many ways. But it&apos;s more than a mere toxic spending package. It&apos;s also a political compact the president is hoping will generate support.

Included in President Obama&apos;s 2013 budget is a pay raise for federal workers. Yeah, it&apos;s only a 0.5% increase. But the federal work force is not one that deserves a raise. It&apos;s a work force that needs to be cut.

Government workers, we are told, are civil servants. But the nation&apos;s roughly 2.1 million federal civilian workers live more like masters. Their average compensation is twice that of private sector workers (see chart), and in terms of only wages, federal employee pay is about 60% higher — $50,462 per year in private industry compared to $81,258 when working for Washington .

And what does the rest of the country get in return for the generous compensation enjoyed by federal workers?

Nothing, as far as we can tell.

In fact, we&apos;d make the argument that the taxpayers are getting a negative return on their &quot;investment.&quot; Federal employees don&apos;t create jobs. Nor do they produce wealth.

            <title>No Freedom For You! When School Lunch Nazis Attack   2.15.12</title>
            <description>Federal Guidelines: The nanny state that tells us what cars we should drive, what energy we must use and what health insurance we must have is now telling mothers what they can put in their children&apos;s school lunches.

We are all familiar with the Transportation Security Administration going through our stuff at the airport on the assumption all of us are potential terrorists. When a similar level of scrutiny is applied to our kids&apos; school lunches on the assumption we are too stupid to feed them properly, we wonder if there&apos;s any place the nanny state will not reach to curtail our freedoms in the name of what&apos;s good for us.

On Jan. 30, a preschooler at West Hoke Elementary School in Raeford, N.C., had three chicken nuggets for lunch because a state employee told her the lunch her mother packed was not nutritious. The girl&apos;s turkey and cheese sandwich, banana, potato chips and apple juice did not meet U.S. Department of Agriculture guidelines. After consuming the approved nuggets, she was sent home with her mom-packed lunch and a bill from the school for $1.25.

The Division of Child Development and Early Education at the Department of Health and Human Services requires all lunches served in pre-kindergarten programs — including in-home day-care centers — to meet USDA guidelines. That means lunches must consist of one serving of meat, one serving of milk, one serving of grain, and two servings of fruit or vegetables, even if the lunches are brought from home.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Irrational Warhead Cuts: Nuclear Gun Control    2.15.12</title>
            <description>National Security: The commander in chief who once pined for a world without nuclear weapons has decided a world without an American deterrent is a good start, seeking to cut the U.S. arsenal by 80%.

In a world where rogue states with unstable leadership are either in possession of or pursuing nuclear weapons, and with Russia rearming and China emerging as a world military and nuclear superpower, President Obama has ordered the Pentagon to consider cutting U.S. strategic nuclear forces to as few as 300 deployed warheads — below the number believed to be in China&apos;s arsenal and far fewer than current Russian strategic weapon stocks.

This latest example of presidential naivete, which makes even Jimmy Carter look like a warmongering hawk, seems based not on geostrategic reality but rather on the wishful thinking that the threat posed is nuclear weapons, not the enemies that possess them.

Pentagon planners have been asked to consider three force levels as part of a Nuclear Posture Review ordered by President Obama last August: a force of 1,100 to 1,000 warheads, a second scenario of between 700 and 800 warheads, and the lowest level of between 300 and 400 warheads.

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney believes that even considering such deep strategic cuts is irrational. &quot;No sane military leader,&quot; he says, &quot;would condone 300 to 400 warheads for an effective nuclear deterrent strategy,&quot; he told Bill Gertz of the Washington Free Beacon.

In a world where rogue states with unstable leadership are either in possession of or pursuing nuclear weapons, and with Russia rearming and China emerging as a world military and nuclear superpower, President Obama has ordered the Pentagon to consider cutting U.S. strategic nuclear forces to as few as 300 deployed warheads — below the number believed to be in China&apos;s arsenal and far fewer than current Russian strategic weapon stocks.

This latest example of presidential naivete, which makes even Jimmy Carter look like a warmongering hawk, seems based not on geostrategic reality but rather on the wishful thinking that the threat posed is nuclear weapons, not the enemies that possess them.

Pentagon planners have been asked to consider three force levels as part of a Nuclear Posture Review ordered by President Obama last August: a force of 1,100 to 1,000 warheads, a second scenario of between 700 and 800 warheads, and the lowest level of between 300 and 400 warheads.

Retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney believes that even considering such deep strategic cuts is irrational. &quot;No sane military leader,&quot; he says, &quot;would condone 300 to 400 warheads for an effective nuclear deterrent strategy,&quot; he told Bill Gertz of the Washington Free Beacon.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama&apos;s Chickens Come Home To Roost In Egypt   2.14.12</title>
            <description>Mideast: As the president sneaks more money in the budget for Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood thugs he helped install in Cairo show their gratitude by threatening to attack Israel.

For three decades, the U.S. essentially paid Egypt not to attack our closest ally in the region. The policy worked to maintain peace. But Obama nullified that deal by backing Islamist revolutionaries against reliably pro-U.S. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Now the bribe has lost its effect.

The new Egyptian leadership, led by the virulently anti-Jewish Muslim Brotherhood, this week issued a warning to Washington that it should understand that &quot;what was acceptable before the revolution is no longer.&quot; It made clear that this includes the peace treaty with Israel.

            <description>Incentives: Doubling down on industrial policy failure, the administration decides to bump up the taxpayer subsidy for Government Motors&apos; touted electric car. Who said its range wasn&apos;t enough to drive us to the poor house?

Tucked away in the recesses of President Obama&apos;s 2013 budget, a budget that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says he will not bring to the Senate floor, is a nugget that speaks volumes about the troubles we&apos;re in:

While delaying the Keystone XL pipeline, the administration plans to increase the subsidy for the Chevy Volt and other &quot;new technology&quot; vehicles to $10,000 per car.

            <description>Suffrage: A new study finds that nearly 2 million dead people remain on voter registration rolls. So tell us again why Democrats oppose voter ID laws that would help prevent these errant registrations from being exploited?

The Pew Center on the States study found that our country&apos;s voter registration system is &quot;plagued with errors and inefficiencies.&quot; That&apos;s putting it mildly.

As many as 24 million registrations are invalid or contain significant errors, including almost 3 million who are registered in two or more states and 1.8 million dead people still listed as active voters.

            <description>Fiscal Policy: President Obama’s top economic adviser says the U.S. should join other nations in creating a “global minimum tax.” One way or another, this administration means to shove a big tax hike down Americans’ throats.

Discussing President Obama&apos;s new budget, Gene Sperling, the White House&apos;s top economist, said &quot;we need a global minimum tax&quot; so no one escapes paying &quot;their fair share.&quot;

This idea is not just bad; it&apos;s likely unconstitutional. In any event, it starkly reveals the underlying premise behind Obama&apos;s latest budget plan: To hike taxes massively on all Americans to pay for an unprecedented expansion of federal government.

            <title>Fast And Furious Gun Control Plot Was Widely Known   2.13.12</title>
            <description>Scandal: A drug enforcement agent says other agencies knew in 2009 about the Justice Department&apos;s gunrunning operation and even tried to interdict the weapons flow. And, yes, it was a gun-control plot.

The notion that Fast and Furious was a localized operation run out of the Phoenix office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives of which few, particularly the arguably clueless Attorney General Eric Holder, were aware continues to be exposed as the lie it is.

&quot;In 2009, I became aware that ATF was walking guns,&quot; Tony Coulson, who was in charge of the Drug Enforcement Agency-Tucson during Operation Fast and Furious, said in a recent interview with Michel Marizco of the website Fronteras.

Media Matters For America head David Brock surrounded himself with &quot;more security than a Third World dictator,&quot; including a semi-automatic-toting &quot;assistant&quot; protecting him from right-wing assassination squads, according to the Daily Caller.

Add in ex-journalist Brock&apos;s reported $250,000 annual salary and Media Matters financier George Soros may start wondering if he&apos;s getting the best, ahem, bang for his buck.

In the message Obama attached to his 2013 budget, he claimed that he&apos;s &quot;taken many steps to reestablish fiscal responsibility.&quot;

But his budget is a colossal monument to irresponsibility, continuing a deficit-fueled spending spree that will take the country ever closer to fiscal ruin.

            <description>Banking: Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker has rightly been lionized for helping kill off 1970s inflation and making the Reagan Revolution possible. That&apos;s why we&apos;re sad to see a bad idea like the &quot;Volcker Rule&quot; as his legacy.

Volcker on Monday filed a letter in support of the proposal that bears his name. For the sake of his reputation, he should rethink that support.

Part of the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislation, the rule prohibits banks from trading stocks or derivatives with their own money. It also limits investments in hedge- and private-equity funds.

            <title>ObamaCare Tax Will Hurt Patients And Destroy Jobs   2.13.12</title>
            <description>Health Care: To help pay ObamaCare&apos;s steep costs, Washington placed a tax on medical device sales. The ugly results: Higher costs that hurt patients, destroy jobs and curb the innovation that extends life and brings relief.

The basic medical devices that we can buy at the retail level won&apos;t be subject to the tax, which begins next year. But devices sold by wholesalers to health care providers will be. According to IRS rules proposed earlier this month, those are instruments &quot;primarily intended for use in a medical institution or office, or by medical professionals.&quot;

The tax rate will be 2.3%, which might not sound punitive. But the National Center for Policy Analysis has taken a look and found that the costs will indeed be dear.

            <itunes:summary>Health Care: To help pay ObamaCare&apos;s steep costs, Washington placed a tax on medical device sales. The ugly results: Higher costs that hurt patients, destroy jobs and curb the innovation that extends life and brings relief.

The basic medical devices that we can buy at the retail level won&apos;t be subject to the tax, which begins next year. But devices sold by wholesalers to health care providers will be. According to IRS rules proposed earlier this month, those are instruments &quot;primarily intended for use in a medical institution or office, or by medical professionals.&quot;

The tax rate will be 2.3%, which might not sound punitive. But the National Center for Policy Analysis has taken a look and found that the costs will indeed be dear.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Will Canadian Oil Be For the Lamps of China?   2.10.12</title>
            <description>Energy: While our president sleeps on the Keystone XL pipeline, Canada’s prime minister is in Beijing signing a series of trade deals to ship additional petroleum to China. Halftime in America? We need a new quarterback.

While Clint Eastwood, in that thinly disguised infomercial for President Obama&apos;s re-election campaign, was promising that the world would soon hear the roar of our engines, China&apos;s economy will soon be revving up with petroleum that should and could be flowing south in a pipeline the Obama administration won&apos;t build.

Prime Minister Steven Harper is making good on his warning that Canada would seek other customers for the vast oil riches locked in the oil sands of Alberta. He is leading a five-day delegation to an energy-hungry China eager to be Canada&apos;s best customer. He will not wait for an American administration fixated on windmills and Solyndras and automakers that produce overpriced electric cars prone to battery fires.

&quot;I am very serious about selling our oil off this continent, selling our energy products off to Asia. I think we have to do that,&quot; Harper said in an interview with Canada&apos;s CTV National News in the wake of President Obama&apos;s decision to kick the Keystone oil can down the road past the November election.

            <title>Democrats Failure To Pass Budget Is Illegal   2.10.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: Two top Democrats in Congress say the legislature doesn&apos;t really need to pass a budget. Excuse us, but passing a budget isn&apos;t optional; it&apos;s required by law. Is this the future of rule under the Democrats?

House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer is tired of passing budgets as the law demands. He thinks Congress can just keep spending money without any sort of budget.

&quot;The fact is, you don&apos;t need a budget,&quot; he said last Tuesday. &quot;We can adopt appropriations bills. We can adopt authorization policies without a budget. We already have an agreed-upon cap on spending.&quot;

Actually, &quot;the fact is,&quot; Congress is required under the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to pass a spending plan and then have it scored by the Congressional Budget Office and signed by the president. That none of this happens suggests a level of disrespect for the law and the people found only among criminals.

As for the &quot;agreed-upon cap on spending&quot; mentioned by Hoyer: How&apos;s that model of fiscal restraint working out? Well, a new report out Thursday notes that Congress has already blown right through the spending &quot;cap&quot; put in place just last summer.

            <title>ObamaCare Violates Far More Than Just Catholic Rights   2.10.12</title>
            <description>Rights: The president&apos;s phony contraception compromise might be enough to convince Catholics their rights aren&apos;t being trampled. But what about the rest of us, who face more rights violations in the name of ObamaCare?

The &quot;accommodation&quot; for the church was an exercise in misdirection. Instead of forcing Catholic organizations to violate a basic tenet of their faith and pay for contraception coverage directly, Obama will instead require insurance companies to provide the coverage free of charge.

But wait a second. Since insurers can&apos;t print money, the only way they&apos;ll be able to afford this new &quot;free&quot; benefit will be to raise premiums on their customers, including the Catholic Church. So the church will end up paying for birth control, just not directly.

Still, the sleight of hand was good enough for the Catholic Health Association, which declared itself &quot;very pleased&quot; with the deal. (The U.S. Catholic bishops hadn&apos;t weighed in by press time.)

Bad as this has been, it&apos;s just a bitter taste of what&apos;s to come under ObamaCare.

Keep in mind that the only reason the contraception mandate became an issue at all is because ObamaCare grants the government wide-ranging authority over what must be covered by insurance, how it&apos;s paid for and who has to buy it.

            <title>Washington Still Flunks Education After So Many Years  2.10.12</title>
            <description>Education: Handing out state-by-state waivers from No Child Left Behind is just a half-measure. It&apos;s time to ask a fundamental question about the federal role in schools: Why?

Washington has spent much and achieved little in its attempts to improve the nation&apos;s public schools. But hope springs eternal. States also need the federal money, and the feds (logically) want to see the money deliver results.

Such are the underpinnings of the seemingly endless debate over the No Child Left Behind Act, signed into law just over a decade ago by George W. Bush.

Wrangling over how to change NCLB has been going on almost as long as the law has been in effect, and the issues are not likely to be settled during the current election year.

Meantime, the Obama administration has been granting waivers to states that agree to an alternate school-improvement plan. These states — 10 out of 28 that have applied — will not have to meet the NCLB goal of having all students &quot;proficient&quot; in reading and math by 2014.

In return, they have to come up with viable plans to prepare kids for jobs or college, to evaluate teachers and reward schools based on performance.

            <description>Subprime Scandal: Announcing a massive $26 billion mortgage deal with &quot;abusive&quot; banks, the president blamed everybody for record foreclosures except the party most culpable: government.

Speaking Thursday from the White House, Obama scolded &quot;irresponsible&quot; and &quot;reckless&quot; lenders, who &quot;sold homes to people who couldn&apos;t afford them.&quot;

He also cited buyers who bought homes bigger than their budgets, and Wall Street bankers who packaged the shaky mortgages and traded them for &quot;profit.&quot;

            <title>Argentina Acts Up—Again—Over Falkland Islands   2.9.12</title>
            <description>Diplomacy: After a string of provocations, the U.K. is finally sending a destroyer down to the Falklands to remind Argentina of the outcome of its ill-fated invasion in 1982. And the U.S.? Coddling the aggressors in the name of &quot;peace.&quot;

Roberta Jacobson, acting U.S. assistant secretary for Western Hemispheric affairs, said the growing dispute between our top ally, Britain, and Hugo-Chavez-aligned Argentina over who rules the Falkland Islands was &quot;a problem between our two partners. We do not want to change our position. We prefer that both countries negotiate a diplomatic solution in that matter,&quot; MercoPress reported.

There&apos;s just one problem with that bland, Obama-like moral equivalency: Argentina&apos;s idea of diplomacy is any nasty act it can think up that doesn&apos;t involve a whupping from the British military.

            <description>Economy: President Obama surfed into office on a wave of support from the nation&apos;s youth. And what did those young voters get in return? Sky-high unemployment, lower wages, fewer prospects and a student debt crisis.

It&apos;s fair to say that just about everyone has suffered the ill effects of Obamanomics, which has produced growth rates during the 31-month &quot;recovery&quot; that are far below any in modern times.

But a new report out of the Pew Research Center shows that when it comes to economic pain, young workers trying to get a start in life have suffered the most. Among the grim statistics:

The new study was conducted by scientists at the University of Colorado, Boulder, published in the journal Nature and based on satellite observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite.

GRACE, which was launched as a joint project between NASA and Germany in 2002, orbits the earth at an altitude of 500 kilometers (315 miles), so it sees everything from the highest peaks down to the mouths of glaciers. The satellite measures gravity, which is related to mass, and would be affected by decreases in polar ice, glaciers or mountain snow packs.

            <title>Payroll Tax Cuts Are Worst Way To Boost Growth   2.8.12</title>
            <description>Fiscal Policy: Intense talks are underway to extend last year&apos;s 2% payroll tax cut set to expire at the end of February. Proponents argue it&apos;s badly needed to boost the economy, but the evidence suggests otherwise.

Democrats who back the payroll cut — even as it adds hundreds of billions of dollars to our nation&apos;s debt — argue it&apos;s needed to keep the recovery from stalling. Despite a huge $160 billion cost in 2012, they say, it&apos;s worth every penny.

We like tax cuts as much as anyone. But the fact is, we&apos;re taking money from a pay-as-you-go retirement system that&apos;s already running in the red, and replacing that cash with IOUs. We&apos;re burdening future generations so we can spend tax cuts now.

That might not be so bad if payroll tax cuts paid an economic dividend. But a new study by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation suggests they don&apos;t. &quot;Based on OECD data on 34-member countries between 2000 and 2010,&quot; the study said, &quot;there is no significant relationship between payroll taxes and long-term economic growth.&quot;

That&apos;s right: no effect. Even so, cutting the payroll tax from 6.2% to 4.2% last year was highly popular, particularly among Democrats. Why? The payroll tax is highly regressive, so the biggest cuts go to low and middle incomes — a favored Democratic bloc. All told, the cuts reach 160 million Americans.

            <title>New Illegal Alien Advocate Undercuts Border Control   2.8.12</title>
            <description>Law: If anything shows how ever-expanding government works at cross-purposes, it&apos;s the Obama administration&apos;s newly named post of &quot;public advocate&quot; for illegal aliens. What part of &quot;illegal&quot; don&apos;t they understand?

It seems those who&apos;ve broken the law by entering the U.S. illegally are now entitled to special U.S. government protection from — the U.S. government. At least, that&apos;s the logic of the phony new &quot;public advocate&quot; post created for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In naming Andrew Lorenzen-Strait to the job, ICE announced he would work &quot;directly for ICE&apos;s Executive Assistant Director of Enforcement and Removal Operations&quot; to help build &quot;constructive relationships with the community and ... resolve problems or concerns.&quot;

And for whom would he do this? &quot;(S)takeholders that include individuals, public, nongovernmental organizations, faith-based organizations and advocacy groups.&quot;

&quot;Stakeholders&quot;? Based on that cast of pressure groups, it&apos;s plain he&apos;ll be an illegal alien advocate.

This new position reflects the Obama administration&apos;s open-borders policy on immigration. It just won&apos;t say so out loud. Rather than dismantling ICE or offering a blanket amnesty, Obama&apos;s creating an illegal alien advocate inside ICE, undercutting its very mission.

Why not have a bank robber&apos;s advocate at the FBI?

            <title>U.S. Afghanistan Victory Actually Returns Taliban To Power   2.8.12</title>
            <description>Afghanistan: After our post-9/11 cakewalk defeating the Taliban, America is entering the end stages of defeat in the Afghan war. Meanwhile, President Obama is crossing his fingers that a &quot;good Taliban&quot; will emerge.

The Obama administration sure knows how to make optimum political use of one-syllable words. &quot;Hope&quot; and &quot;Change,&quot; endlessly repeated, got Barack Obama into the White House.

But last year, the administration stole a word former President George W. Bush had a copyright on: &quot;surge.&quot;

A year ago, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton trumped Bush&apos;s successful military surge in Iraq with &quot;a strategy with three mutually reinforcing tracks — three surges, if you will&quot; in Afghanistan.

The first &quot;surge&quot; was military. The second was &quot;a civilian campaign to bolster the governments, economies and civil societies of Afghanistan and Pakistan.&quot; And, most ominously, the third &quot;surge&quot; was &quot;an intensified diplomatic push.&quot;

But the third so-called surge — negotiating with the very same Islamofascist terrorists we routed 10 years ago and fishing for &quot;moderates&quot; — is something that was inconceivable a decade ago, when the 9/11 attacks were fresh in our memory. It even included negotiating with a fake top Afghan envoy who conned tens of thousands of U.S. dollars for himself.

            <title>Army Chaplains Stopped From Reading Bishop’s Letter  2.8.12</title>
            <description>Constitution: The Air Force removes a reference to God from its logo as the Army forbids Catholic chaplains from reading an archbishop&apos;s letter to those in uniform. What&apos;s next, the crosses at Arlington National Cemetery?

&apos;It is a blow to a freedom that you have fought to defend and for which you have seen your buddies fall in battle,&quot; read the letter from Archbishop Timothy Broglio, who leads the Roman Catholic Archdiocese for the Military Services to the Catholic chaplains in the U.S. military.

The letter that the Army&apos;s Office of the Chief of Chaplains kept from being read to Catholic soldiers concerned the recent Health and Human Services mandate requiring Catholic institutions to provide contraceptive services.

The letter was similar to others recently distributed by the Catholic bishops of the U.S. to be read from the pulpit in each parish. Bishops were allowed to tailor the letters for their particular audience.

That was what Archbishop Broglio did when he wrote the &quot;blow to freedom&quot; line above, adding: &quot;The federal government, which claims to be &apos;of, by, and for the people,&apos; has just dealt a heavy blow to almost a quarter of those people — the Catholic population — and to the millions more who are served by the Catholic faith.&quot;

He included the pledge that &quot;the Church cannot — and will not — comply with this unjust law.&quot;

            <description>Politics: In its latest projection, the Congressional Budget Office found that the Social Security Trust Fund had $1 trillion less than expected. Seems it always happens this way. When will Washington recognize that the problem is the model?

In an A1 story Friday by IBD&apos;s Jed Graham, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said it now expects the supposedly vaunted and unsinkable trust fund to peak in 2018 and then decline to $2.7 trillion by 2022.

That&apos;s a trillion dollars less than what was projected to be in the pot last year.

            <title>Media Defends Planned Parenthood, Not Catholic Church   2.7.12</title>
            <description>Journalism: When the abortion giant&apos;s funding was in jeopardy, the media provided 24/7 coverage with a decidedly liberal slant. When the feds assaulted First Amendment religious freedom, you could hear the crickets chirp.

Secular progressive bias in the media was never more evident than in the past few weeks with the difference in coverage of two major news stories — the temporary cutoff of funds from the Susan G. Komen Foundation to Planned Parenthood and the ultimatum from the Obama administration that the Catholic Church and its institutions had a year to find a way to violate their consciences and beliefs and provide contraceptive services as mandated by ObamaCare.

A study by the Media Research Center (MRC) shows that in the first 60 hours after the Feb. 1 announcement that Komen was cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood, no fewer than 13 major stories appeared on CBS, NBC and ABC morning and evening news shows with 35 clips and quotes coming from supporters or representatives of Planned Parenthood and only 11 from Komen representatives or supporters.

            <description>Campaign Finance: Reversing his earlier stance, President Obama now says he&apos;ll accept money to fund his campaign from so-called super-PACs. Does the president have any principles he won&apos;t sacrifice?

In 2008 and again in 2010, President Obama took a tough stance on outside financing of political campaigns. In 2008, he inveighed against the pernicious influence of big money in politics and pledged to fund his campaign with federal matching funds.

But when he discovered he could raise a lot more on his own, he broke that pledge, raising $750 million.

            <itunes:summary>Campaign Finance: Reversing his earlier stance, President Obama now says he&apos;ll accept money to fund his campaign from so-called super-PACs. Does the president have any principles he won&apos;t sacrifice?

In 2008 and again in 2010, President Obama took a tough stance on outside financing of political campaigns. In 2008, he inveighed against the pernicious influence of big money in politics and pledged to fund his campaign with federal matching funds.

But when he discovered he could raise a lot more on his own, he broke that pledge, raising $750 million.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Our Constitution Is The Best Model A Country Could Have   2.7.12</title>
            <description>America&apos;s Legacy: Our Constitution is no longer respected as it once was. Nations writing new constitutions don&apos;t see it as the prototype to be followed. All have something in common with our president.

A study to be published in June in the New York University Law Review finds that our Constitution &quot;appears to be losing its appeal as a model for constitutional drafters elsewhere.&quot;

&quot;Among the world&apos;s democracies,&quot; writes David Law of Washington University in St. Louis and Mila Versteeg of the University of Virginia, &quot;constitutional similarity to the United States has clearly gone into free fall.

            <description>Mideast: Russia&apos;s and China&apos;s obstruction of a United Nations condemnation of Syrian bloodshed speaks volumes about how oppressors flock together. Where was President Obama&apos;s supposed diplomatic prowess?

Why are post-Cold War Russia and China acting the same way they used to in the U.N. Security Council?

What are the motivations of Moscow and Beijing in vetoing a U.N. resolution against Syria&apos;s extermination of hundreds of &quot;Arab Spring&quot; anti-government demonstrators in the city of Homs, including children, according to eyewitnesses? Isn&apos;t the condemnation of a regime that mortars its popular opposition exactly what the U.N. was designed to do?

            <title>No Senate Budget But It Ponders Buffett Rule Law   2.6.12</title>
            <description>Taxes: The Senate hasn&apos;t passed a budget in over a thousand days, yet it has time to consider one member&apos;s bill to make the no-growth logic of the administration&apos;s favorite billionaire the law of the land.

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat from the state ranking among the highest in foreclosures and unemployment, would prefer leaving the ship of state to drift rudderlessly. &quot;We do not need to bring a budget to the floor this year — it&apos;s done, we don&apos;t need to do it,&quot; Reid told reporters Friday.

Reid&apos;s idea of getting things done is punting to a supercommittee that itself punts on entitlement reform and continuing resolutions that keep us on the path paved by Greece. &quot;They&apos;re attacking us because they have nothing better to do,&quot; Reid said. &quot;They need something else to talk about.&quot;

            <title>Soros Warns Of Chaos, But Supports People Creating It   2.6.12</title>
            <description>Politics: In its latest projection, the Congressional Budget Office found that the Social Security Trust Fund had $1 trillion less than expected. Seems it always happens this way. When will Washington recognize that the problem is the model?

Politics: Billionaire George Soros has been warning in recent weeks of &quot;chaos&quot; coming to the West. That&apos;s curious. Because by the wildest of coincidences, he just happens to be supporting the radicals creating it.

The leftist speculator who seeks a one-world government hasn&apos;t been shy about whipping up instability. Like a street corner Marxist, he told Newsweek that class war was just around the corner.

&quot;I am not here to cheer you up,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation is about as serious and difficult as I&apos;ve experienced in my career.&quot; The current financial crisis, he said, is like the fall of the Berlin Wall, a moral equivocation typical of his efforts to blur capitalism and communism.

            <title>Eying Facebook IPO, California Is A Friend In Need   2.6.12</title>
            <description>California: The coming IPO gets a big &quot;like&quot; from a cash-strapped state, but any tax windfall may be long in coming. And if the past is any guide, it would just feed a spending habit.

Facebook made some people very happy when it filed documents last week for its $5 billion stock offering, and we&apos;re not talking about the new 0.01 percenters it will be minting with the upcoming IPO.

In the state capital of Sacramento, the prospect of so many instant millionaires had the effect of a dinner bell: Fortunes were to be made, then taxed; now we can eat.

            <title>Komen Funding Flap Exposes Planned Parenthood&apos;s Lie   2.3.12</title>
            <description>Charity: On the surface, the Komen Foundation&apos;s reversal of its Planned Parenthood grant cut-off shows the left&apos;s power to enforce conformity. What it really reveals is that Planned Parenthood doesn&apos;t need taxpayer support.

When the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation announced it was planning to stop giving money to Planned Parenthood a short five years after it started, you&apos;d have thought from the reaction that it had committed a capital crime.

Liberals brutally denounced the charity. More than two dozen Democratic senators called on Komen to reconsider. One of them, California&apos;s Barbara Boxer, said the funding cutoff reminded her of &quot;the McCarthy era.&quot;

In short order, Komen more or less reversed itself, rather than see its hugely successful, 30-year effort to cut breast cancer deaths burned to the ground by a liberal lynch mob.

But before Komen caved, an interesting thing happened: Donations to Planned Parenthood exploded. Within hours, in fact, 6,000 donated a total of $400,000. A family in Dallas pledged $250,000, and New York&apos;s Mayor Bloomberg promised to match that.

In other words, Planned Parenthood more than made up for the $680,000 in grants that Komen was planning to withhold.

            <title>As Obama Crows, Real Story Is 10.5 Mil Jobs Deficit   2.3.12</title>
            <description>Jobs: Of course it&apos;s good news that 243,000 new jobs were created in January, shaving the unemployment rate to 8.3%. But thanks to massive policy errors by the White House, we&apos;re still way below where we should be.

President Obama, speaking in Arlington, Va., immediately took credit for the bullish report, crowing that &quot;altogether, we&apos;ve added 3.7 million new jobs over the last 23 months.&quot;

The president went on to say: &quot;We can&apos;t go back to the policies that led to the recession. And we can&apos;t let Washington stand in the way of our recovery.&quot;

&quot;Our&quot; recovery? And &quot;We can&apos;t go back to the policies that led to the recession&quot;? The cause of the recession was, in fact, housing policies put in place by President Clinton and aggressively supported by Democrats in Congress, including former Sen. Barack Obama.

How soon we forget. These were the policies that led to the housing meltdown, the financial crisis and, ultimately, the deep recession we&apos;re still climbing out of.

            <title>Obama’s Rhetoric Vs. Reality On Capital Gains   2.3.12</title>
            <description>Taxes: President Obama&apos;s campaign to soak rich investors is already getting complicated. His small-business breaks would benefit those he says are paying less than a fair share.

The State of the Union speech is fast fading into history, but one of its themes — raising taxes on the rich — has legs in politics if not in policy. This is an election year, and the idea of making people like Warren Buffett (or Mitt Romney) pay a higher share of the income to the government polls well.

One of Obama&apos;s allies in Congress, Rep. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., has introduced a bill that would impose a minimum effective tax rate of 30% on people earning more than $1 million. The bill may not get very far in the current Congress, but that&apos;s not the point. The object is to win in November. The 30% bill is political rhetoric, not serious policy.

Even Obama must know that his endorsement of a 30% minimum tax on the wealthy is just hot air. As a practical matter, the only way to garner that much from the Warren Buffett-Mitt Romney set is to end preferential treatment for capital gains and stock dividends, raising the top rates from 15% to 35%.

Even then, a big giver to church and charity, such as Romney, would still be able to keep the federal share tax bite below 30%.

But the Obama administration says, at least this time around, that it will leave the charitable deduction alone. So it would have to dig deeply into investment income if it is to come close to imposing a Buffett Rule that meets its own fairness test.

            <itunes:subtitle>Taxes: President Obama&apos;s campaign to soak rich investors is already getting complicated. His small-business breaks would benefit those he says are paying less than a fair share.</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Taxes: President Obama&apos;s campaign to soak rich investors is already getting complicated. His small-business breaks would benefit those he says are paying less than a fair share.

The State of the Union speech is fast fading into history, but one of its themes — raising taxes on the rich — has legs in politics if not in policy. This is an election year, and the idea of making people like Warren Buffett (or Mitt Romney) pay a higher share of the income to the government polls well.

One of Obama&apos;s allies in Congress, Rep. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., has introduced a bill that would impose a minimum effective tax rate of 30% on people earning more than $1 million. The bill may not get very far in the current Congress, but that&apos;s not the point. The object is to win in November. The 30% bill is political rhetoric, not serious policy.

Even Obama must know that his endorsement of a 30% minimum tax on the wealthy is just hot air. As a practical matter, the only way to garner that much from the Warren Buffett-Mitt Romney set is to end preferential treatment for capital gains and stock dividends, raising the top rates from 15% to 35%.

Even then, a big giver to church and charity, such as Romney, would still be able to keep the federal share tax bite below 30%.

But the Obama administration says, at least this time around, that it will leave the charitable deduction alone. So it would have to dig deeply into investment income if it is to come close to imposing a Buffett Rule that meets its own fairness test.</itunes:summary>

            <title>White House More Worried About Israel Than Nuclear Iran   2.3.12</title>
            <description>Nuclear Terror: The administration claims economic sanctions are working in preventing Iran from making a nuclear weapon. Why, then, is Tehran apparently assembling a missile that can reach the U.S.? To carry TNT?

President Obama has described the waves of economic sanctions imposed on Islamofascist Iran as &quot;the sort of pressure that will have a direct impact on the Iranian government.&quot;

Secretary of State Hillary Clinton last month claimed that &quot;sanctions have been working,&quot; making it &quot;much more difficult for Iran to pursue its nuclear ambitions.&quot;

Foundation for Defense of Democracies President Cliff May concedes that sanctions have done some good, but are far from enough. In a column last week, he noted Iran&apos;s currency has lost half its value since December, inflation is officially over 20% and may really be twice that, and crude oil production is falling.

Plus, &quot;Iran&apos;s rulers have forfeited more than $60 billion in energy investment and $14 billion in annual oil sales,&quot; with hundreds of billions of dollars in potential natural gas sales prevented.

            <title>Food Gestapo Seek A Bureau Of Alcohol, Tobacco, Sugar   2.3.12</title>
            <description>Nanny State: The food police who&apos;ve targeted everything from salt to Happy Meals now set their sights on regulating sugar as a controlled substance to fight obesity. The fat we should fear most, though, is overweight government.

The pursuit of happiness, one of those unalienable rights endowed to us by our Creator, is under assault once again by those who spend every waking moment worrying that somebody somewhere is actually enjoying his or her life without government supervision.

In an article titled &quot;The Toxic Truth About Sugar,&quot; published in the journal Nature, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (where else?) said worldwide consumption of sugar has tripled over the last 50 years and is now contributing to 35 million annual deaths, even if sugar-coated corn flakes aren&apos;t listed as the causes of death.

Whether these unfortunate victims of what may be called &quot;cereal killers&quot; died happy is also not recorded.

The researchers cite three major health risks — alcohol, tobacco and sugar.

&quot;Two of these three — tobacco and alcohol — are regulated by governments to protect public health, leaving one of the primary culprits behind this worldwide health crisis unchecked,&quot; the researchers write.

            <description>Scandal: In a shameful performance, the attorney general Thursday reprised his tap-dancing routine before a panel investigating the Fast and Furious gunrunning operation that got U.S. agents and Mexicans killed.

&apos;It&apos;s Groundhog Day, and Brian Terry&apos;s family and taxpayers are still waiting for Fast and Furious answers from the Justice Department,&quot; Chairman Darrell Issa said before the hearings. &quot;We will not wait until the next Groundhog Day to get answers for the American people.&quot;

Rep. Issa, R-Calif., has threatened Attorney General Eric Holder with a contempt of Congress citation if he doesn&apos;t get answers to questions on Fast and Furious, such as who authorized it and what and when Holder knew. The story constantly changes.

Each week, it seems, brings fresh evidence that the Obama administration&apos;s obsession with so-called clean energy is an increasingly costly failure.

January car sales data out this week provided additional proof that consumers are turning their backs on electric cars, making President Obama&apos;s pledge to get a million of them on the road in three years look even more ridiculous.

            <description>Church And State: President Obama has taken a very powerful name in vain in defense of his class warfare economic policies. In fact, Obama encourages a sin Jesus Christ repeatedly admonished: envy.

Attending the National Prayer Breakfast on Thursday, President Obama declared that raising tax rates on higher incomes &quot;coincides with Jesus&apos; teaching that &apos;for unto whom much is given, much shall be required.&apos;&quot;

It is disgraceful enough for a president to use a religious event to push an economic agenda that has already insured his place in history as the food stamp president.

In fact, Washington is steadily retreating full circle back to the defensive posture it took toward Afghanistan in 1996.

Then, the Clinton administration coddled the thuggish regime and let it seize power. In no time it hosted al-Qaida&apos;s leaders, who were able to open major terror camps around the country, where they eventually trained the 9/11 hijackers.

            <title>Catholic Bishops Reject Obama’s Surrender Terms   2.1.12</title>
            <description>1st Amendment: Catholic bishops on Sunday issued a response to ObamaCare&apos;s mandates on providing contraception in violation of conscience and religious freedom. The message was simple: We will not comply.

It was hardly a profile in courage when the Obama administration, hoping to kick the issue down the road past the November election, announced last Friday that Catholic hospitals and other religious institutions will have an extra year to comply with a new requirement that most health plans provide contraceptive benefits at no cost to their members.

On Sunday, America&apos;s Catholic bishops in an open letter to their parishioners and their government said they would not comply.

Champions of the separation of church and state have let the crickets chirp on this matter.

Not silent are those such as Bishop Richard Lennon of the Cleveland Catholic Diocese. They let it be known they&apos;ll fight this assault on the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of religion.

&quot;Unless this rule is overturned, Catholics will be compelled either to violate our consciences or to drop health care coverage for our employees ... ,&quot; Lennon wrote in his letter read by priests throughout the Catholic Diocese of Cleveland during weekend Masses.

The Obama administration is &quot;denying to Catholics our nation&apos;s first and most fundamental freedom — that of religious liberty. We cannot — we will not — comply with this unjust law.&quot;

            <title>Obama Complicates Mortgage Process  2.1.12</title>
            <description>Rules: In a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; moment, the president suggests Republicans oppose his financial overhaul because they detest simplicity. Nothing&apos;s more complex than Dodd-Frank.

In a speech proposing his so-called Homeowners Bill of Rights, Obama held up a simplified mortgage form as an example of the great work his new bank watchdog agency is doing.

&quot;This, by the way, is what some of the folks in Congress are trying to roll back and prevent from happening,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess they like complicated things that confuse consumers and allow them to be cheated. I prefer actions that are taken to make things simpler.&quot;

Apparently he didn&apos;t read the 2,300-page bill he signed. It authorizes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to do things that only complicate the mortgage process, including:

• Requiring lenders to report reams of new data related to race.

• Conducting studies on the fairness of the FICO credit scoring system.

• Setting up an Office of Fair Lending to police banks and &quot;target areas of greatest risk for discrimination.&quot;

• Overseeing the placement of a diversity czar in each federal financial agency, including the Fed and its 12 regional banks.

            <itunes:summary>Rules: In a &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; moment, the president suggests Republicans oppose his financial overhaul because they detest simplicity. Nothing&apos;s more complex than Dodd-Frank.

In a speech proposing his so-called Homeowners Bill of Rights, Obama held up a simplified mortgage form as an example of the great work his new bank watchdog agency is doing.

&quot;This, by the way, is what some of the folks in Congress are trying to roll back and prevent from happening,&quot; he said. &quot;I guess they like complicated things that confuse consumers and allow them to be cheated. I prefer actions that are taken to make things simpler.&quot;

Apparently he didn&apos;t read the 2,300-page bill he signed. It authorizes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to do things that only complicate the mortgage process, including:

• Requiring lenders to report reams of new data related to race.

• Conducting studies on the fairness of the FICO credit scoring system.

• Setting up an Office of Fair Lending to police banks and &quot;target areas of greatest risk for discrimination.&quot;

• Overseeing the placement of a diversity czar in each federal financial agency, including the Fed and its 12 regional banks.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Unions Use Intimidation Tactics To Get Members   2.1.12</title>
            <description>Intimidation: Union membership in the private sector has been in a long decline. Big Labor bosses are naturally desperate. What standards of decency will they violate next to reverse the slide?

Representing the union bosses within the federal government is the National Labor Relations Board. Its chairman is Mark Pearce, who wants the board to propose several new rules, including one that would require union-targeted companies to provide organized labor with a list of employee names, home addresses, phone numbers and email addresses.

The union chiefs, who take in more than $8 billion a year in dues and have almost $9 billion in assets, say this is simply a way to keep every eligible employee informed.

To everyone else, it&apos;s clear that unions can — and will — use such a list to intimidate workers. At the very least, the unions could use the information to annoy, harass and propagandize employees that they believe aren&apos;t on board with the union agenda.

Don&apos;t forget that a year ago, 15 Republican lawmakers found out how dangerous it can be to be on organized labor&apos;s bad side.

Last winter, a union supporter used email to issue death threats to 15 Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin while that state was convulsing over Gov. Scott Walker&apos;s effort to bring sanity to government finances. E-mail is an easy, virtually anonymous way for cowards to terrorize anyone they have differences with.

            <description>Economy: The media&apos;s &quot;improving economy&quot; this election year exists only in Democrats&apos; talking points. A new congressional report shows that joblessness is underestimated, while debt skyrockets.

Thirty-six pages into the Congressional Budget Office&apos;s &quot;Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2012 to 2022,&quot; released Tuesday, is the news that &quot;the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2011 would have been about 1 1/4 percentage points higher than the actual rate of 8.7%&quot; once the &quot;unusually large decline over so short a time&quot; in labor force participation is factored out.

This means that, contrary to the claims of a media rooting for Obama re-election, the real jobless rate is nearly 10% — belying the notion of an Obama-led &quot;recovery.&quot;

            <description>Oversight: Thanks to IBD, Congress is finally probing the administration&apos;s shakedown of banks over alleged &quot;lending discrimination.&quot; At issue is backdoor funding of Acorn clones.

Last week, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith fired off a three-page letter to Attorney General Eric Holder warning that his recent punishment of Bank of America&apos;s mortgage unit seemed political. In fact, he may have abused his power.

As IBD first reported Jan. 4, &apos;BofA Must Pay Excess Settlement Funds To Acorn Clones,&quot; the $335 million lending-bias deal requires BofA to fork over a chunk of the payout to leftist groups not connected to the suit.

            <title>Mother Of All Stimuluses    1.31.12</title>
            <description>Housing Policy: The listless recovery has forced the president to go back to the drawing board on his mortgage program. His latest tonic is a massively risky stimulus financed on the backs of banks.

In a major program expansion, President Obama in his State of the Union proposed authorizing FHA to provide all &quot;responsible&quot; homeowners the chance to refinance their mortgages at today&apos;s record-low interest rates. &quot;I&apos;m sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low interest rates,&quot; he said. &quot;No more red tape. No more runaround from banks.&quot;

Unlike his disappointing HARP program, launched in 2009, Obama&apos;s new-and-improved refinancing plan would not limit participation to borrowers whose loans are already backed by government-controlled Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Homeowners with privately held mortgages would also qualify.

            <description>Energy: Small- and medium-size businesses serving Louisiana&apos;s energy industry are shedding employees, dipping into personal savings or moving elsewhere to stay afloat. The administration&apos;s war on fossil fuels is taking its toll.

The federal six-month moratorium on drilling that was issued in May 2010, after the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, has been officially lifted, but it might as well still be in effect.

The glacial permitting process put in place in the aftermath in the name of public safety is killing an industry pledged to wean us from the &quot;energy of the past&quot; will not mourn.

Al Gore, who invented global warming hysteria, has most recently been found planning a trip to Antarctica where he will surely find evidence that man is overheating the planet.

This clearly insecure man who so desperately needs an audience that approves of his world-saving efforts says he will be taking with him &quot;a large number of civic and business leaders, activists and concerned citizens from many countries.&quot;

In a blog post on Publius&apos; Forum this week, Warner Todd Huston noted the glaring difference in how the media treated the recent arrests of Zachary Edwards and Tim Russell.

Edwards, an Iowa Democrat, was charged last week with trying to commit identity theft against Matt Schultz, Iowa&apos;s Republican secretary of state, in order to pin unethical or illegal activity on him.

            <title>Eric Holder&apos;s False Testimony Warrants Impeachment    1.30.12</title>
            <description>Scandal: For incompetence alone, Attorney General Eric Holder should resign in the wake of the illegal &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; gunrunning scandal. But fresh news that he knew of it and is covering it up warrants impeachment.

In the latest Friday night document dump — news released as to minimize its scandalous impact on the White House — congressional investigators learned that Attorney General Holder knew all along that a gun his Justice Department intentionally let fall into the hands of Mexico&apos;s cartels was used to murder U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry on Dec. 15, 2010.

Holder must have known right away because his Deputy Chief of Staff Monty Wilkinson received an email from then-Arizona U.S. Attorney General Dennis Burke telling him just that: &quot;The guns found in the desert near the murder(ed) BP officer connect back to the investigation we were going to talk about — they were AK-47s purchased at a Phoenix gun store.&quot;

In the latest Friday night document dump — news released as to minimize its scandalous impact on the White House — congressional investigators learned that Attorney General Holder knew all along that a gun his Justice Department intentionally let fall into the hands of Mexico&apos;s cartels was used to murder U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry on Dec. 15, 2010.

Holder must have known right away because his Deputy Chief of Staff Monty Wilkinson received an email from then-Arizona U.S. Attorney General Dennis Burke telling him just that: &quot;The guns found in the desert near the murder(ed) BP officer connect back to the investigation we were going to talk about — they were AK-47s purchased at a Phoenix gun store.&quot;</itunes:summary>

            <title>Don&apos;t Blame School Food For Obesity   1.30.12</title>
            <description>Obesity: Don&apos;t blame the on-campus sale of snacks for making kids fat. So says a study of 19,000 middle-schoolers. Shouldn&apos;t it be clear by now that good health starts at home?

It&apos;s time to chill out about the Cheetos, if these or similar guilty pleasures are being sold at your kids school. It&apos;s not that they&apos;re nutritious. It&apos;s just that they&apos;re not the dangerous fat bombs that many dietary activists have made them out to be.

And another thing: Don&apos;t expect school to teach your children how to eat. That&apos;s up to you, Mom and Dad.

            <title>The $1.2 Tril Gap: Obama&apos;s Subpar Recovery Continues   1.27.12</title>
            <description>Economy: The latest economic data make it clear that President Obama&apos;s policies aren&apos;t helping the country get stronger. Rather, they&apos;re smothering what should have been a solid recovery.

Real GDP climbed a less-than-expected 2.8% in final quarter of 2011, and just 1.7% for the entire year, down from 3% in 2010. The trend of subpar growth under Obama continues.

To get a better sense of how bad Obama&apos;s recovery is, consider this: Under Obama, real GDP has climbed a total of just 6% in the two-and-a-half years since the recession ended in June 2009.

By comparison, real GDP had grown 16% by this point in the Reagan recovery, after the very deep and painful 1981-82 recession.

Had Obama&apos;s recovery been as powerful as Reagan&apos;s, the economic pie would be $1.2 trillion bigger today.

And had job growth under Obama kept pace with job growth during the Reagan recovery, there would be 10 million — yes 10 million — more people with jobs today.

So what explains the difference between these two recoveries? Obama and his legion of liberal defenders claim the last recession was so deep that we&apos;re just now getting back on our feet.

            <title>Democrats Vs. Republicans: Who&apos;s The Most Greedy?   1.27.12</title>
            <description>Greed: Rich businessman Mitt Romney gave more than 16% of his income to charity last year. A few years back, Barack and Michelle Obama gave less than 1% of theirs. Aren&apos;t Republicans supposed to be the heartless ones?

According to their tax returns, the Obamas gave to charitable causes just $10,772 of the $1.2 million they earned from 2000 through 2004. In 2005 and 2006, they boosted their giving a bit to 5%.

How about Vice President Joe Biden? Surely he could top the Obamas and save some face for the party that purports to be all about helping the poor. But no.

Biden and his wife gave an average of $369 a year to charity for the decade preceding his vice presidency, according to USA Today. That amounted to 0.3% of their income. They haven&apos;t been much more generous since Biden became veep. In 2010, they gave $5,350, or roughly 1.4%.

Maybe the Clintons, the last Democrats to hold the White House before the Obamas, can save the party&apos;s reputation. From 2000 to 2006, their donations averaged 8.26% of income, from a low of 1.21% in 2002 to a high of 12.57% two years later, says the Tax Foundation.

Better, but not exactly Romney territory. The former Massachusetts governor gave 13.73% of his income to charity in 2010 and an estimated 19.14% last year.

            <title>Obama Tosses Left A Bone With Anti-Bank Witch Hunt   1.27.12</title>
            <description>Politics: President Obama has unveiled a new task force to &quot;investigate&quot; America&apos;s banks. But he&apos;s just pinning blame for bad economic choices on the victims of job-killing mandates, while throwing a bone to his political base.

Nobody was happier than the leftists of MoveOn.org when the president announced at his State of the Union address that he&apos;d ask Attorney General Eric Holder to form a special unit of federal prosecutors and state attorneys general to investigate &quot;the abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages&quot; that led to the economic crisis five years ago.

&quot;Did you watch the State of the Union tonight?&quot; emailed MoveOn organizer Elena Perez within minutes of the president&apos;s speech. &quot;President Obama did exactly what hundreds of thousands of us have been calling on him to do — he announced a federal investigation into Wall Street.

&quot;This is truly a huge victory for the 99% movement,&quot; she gushed, in a reference to the MoveOn-spawned Occupy protest movement.

&quot;Hundreds of thousands of us signed petitions, made calls and held signs outside in the cold to make this issue something that President Obama couldn&apos;t ignore,&quot; she wrote. &quot;Can you take a few minutes and thank President Obama for holding Wall Street accountable?&quot;

            <title>Yet Another Obama-Favored Green Company Goes Bankrupt  1.27.12</title>
            <description>Energy: In yet another &quot;Solyndra,&quot; a car battery maker that got $118 million in stimulus funds has declared bankruptcy. Once again, when this administration picks corporate winners, the taxpayers become losers.

A year ago, Vice President Joe Biden toured the Ener1 Inc. battery factory in Greenfield, Ind., and viewed a &quot;THINK City&quot; electric car that uses Ener1 batteries.

Ener1&apos;s employees &quot;will surely benefit from the three-part plan that Vice President Biden announced today,&quot; the White House promised. That plan includes rebates, research and development and the promotion of public charging stations, and seeks by 2015 to put on the road roughly 1 million &quot;advanced technology vehicles&quot; — a cooler-sounding name for the electric geekmobiles no one wants to drive.

The White House boasted that the facility Biden visited &quot;would not exist if not for a $118.5 million grant from the Department of Energy ... part of a $2.4 billion Recovery Act investment in electric vehicles.&quot;

The Obama administration a year ago said &quot;the future looks bright&quot; for Ener1 and promised that the firm would employ 1,400 workers by next year.

            <description>Taxes: President Obama should have done a little more due diligence before making Warren Buffett&apos;s secretary the poster child for raising taxes on the rich. Her story gets fishier by the minute.

Ever since Buffett claimed his secretary paid taxes at a higher rate than he did, Obama has been trumpeting Debbie Bosanek as proof that the rich don&apos;t pay their fair share.

He brought her up in his State of the Union speech, and even invited Bosanek to sit next to Michelle Obama. She has become a virtual posterwoman for Obama&apos;s push to boost taxes on the rich.

Earlier this week during a CNN interview, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi warned that Newt Gingrich would never be elected president because &quot;there&apos;s something I know&quot; — suggesting secrets never disclosed in the publicly available 1,280-page ethics investigation report on Gingrich from the 1990s.

Gingrich challenged Pelosi to &quot;spit it out,&quot; but Pelosi immediately backpedaled, claiming she was referring to facts already documented.

            <description>Keystone XL: Forget for a minute the sheer stupidity of stopping a pipeline that creates jobs at no cost to U.S. taxpayers. The harm done to Canada merits some attention as well.

Depending on your point of view, Barack Obama&apos;s decision last week to block the Keystone XL pipeline is a triumph for radical greenies, a job killer, a potential boon to China or a cynical political ploy.

Actually, it&apos;s all of these. One thing it&apos;s not is good for Canada. That fact deserves more play than it&apos;s getting. Canada doesn&apos;t deserve to be the victim, as it is now, of election-year American politics.

            <title>CNN Turns Blind Eye To Obama-Alinsky Ties   1.26.12</title>
            <description>Journalism: As the president launches his re-election bid by striking a more centrist tone, the partisan press is helping him whitewash his radical past. Teamwork or not, it&apos;ll be hard to bleach.

Exhibit A is CNN&apos;s Soledad O&apos;Brien. Earlier this week, she hosted a segment that tried to de-link Obama from Chicago socialist Saul Alinsky. The late Alinsky is the father of community organizing and the author of the far-left bible &quot;Rules for Radicals.&quot;

O&apos;Brien opened her piece by scolding GOP front-runner Newt Gingrich for warning Obama &quot;will represent Saul Alinsky (and) European socialism&quot; in a second term. &quot;President Obama has never said that he was influenced by Alinsky,&quot; O&apos;Brien insisted.

            <title>Obama Widens Jihad On Lenders   1.25.12</title>
            <description>Credit Market: The president says he wants to revive the housing market. So why is he creating a special crimes unit to &quot;crack down&quot; on &quot;abusive&quot; lenders? The move will only scare off needed capital.

The creation of the Orwellian-sounding Financial Crimes Unit, announced during Obama&apos;s State of the Union, opens a new front in his crusade to criminalize banks.

He&apos;s already set up a first-of-its-kind Fair Lending Unit led by a special prosecutor to gun for allegedly racist banks. It&apos;s working closely with bank watchdog Richard Cordray at the newly formed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

Now Obama&apos;s directing Attorney General Eric Holder to launch a special unit of state attorneys general and federal prosecutors to coordinate the investigation of banks that sold &quot;predatory&quot; loans or packaged them into securities sold by Wall Street.

&quot;We will establish a Financial Crimes Unit of highly trained investigators to crack down on large-scale fraud,&quot; Obama said.

&quot;I am asking my attorney general to create a special unit of federal prosecutors and leading state attorneys general to expand our investigations into abusive lending and packaging of risky mortgages that led to the housing crisis,&quot; he said.

Obama added, &quot;We&apos;ve all paid the price for lenders who sold mortgages to people who couldn&apos;t afford them.&quot; Now, he suggested, it&apos;s lenders&apos; turn to pay the price.

Of course, it was Washington that ordered lenders to make those risky loans. Now they&apos;re being punished for doing too well what they were ordered to do before the crisis.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Hypocrisy: Making Warren Buffett Richer 1.25.12</title>
            <description>Hypocrisy: As the great investor&apos;s secretary sat with the first lady at the State of the Union, the president spoke of economic &quot;fairness.&quot; Is it fair to make a supporter wealthier at the expense of the American people?

During the 2008 campaign, candidate Barack Obama cited billionaire Warren Buffett as one of his economic muses. In the 2012 State of the Union address Tuesday night, the president returned to his advocacy of the &quot;Buffett rule,&quot; a proposed minimum tax on millionaires and billionaires.

To highlight his theme of &quot;fairness,&quot; there in the first lady&apos;s box sat Buffett&apos;s secretary, Debbie Bosanek, whom the president has often cited as an example of the unfairness of our tax code and our economy as a whole. Obama claims she pays a lower tax rate than her boss.

&quot;Now, you can call this class warfare all you want,&quot; the president told Congress. &quot;But asking a billionaire to pay at least as much as his secretary in taxes? Most Americans would call that common sense.&quot;

No, most Americans would call that demagoguery.

            <title>The Real House Of Cards Is Government   1.25.12</title>
            <description>GOP Response: President Obama&apos;s State of the Union was notable for what it left out, such as candid talk about out-of-control spending and the national debt. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels filled those gaps.

In today&apos;s America as Obama depicts it, things are going pretty darn well, considering the mess he inherited. The troops are coming home, the private sector is cranking out jobs again, and there&apos;s really nothing wrong with the economy that can&apos;t be solved with more domestic manufacturing jobs and &quot;fairness&quot; — that is, raising Mitt Romney&apos;s taxes.

Throwing some bankers in prison would be nice, too.

This, we suggest, is more or less what casual viewers took away from Tuesday&apos;s State of the Union speech. The same viewers may not even have stayed tuned for the Republican response. If so, they missed a speech that addressed their real concerns.

Daniels, delivering the GOP&apos;s statement, got right to the point after the obligatory hat tip to the president&apos;s real achievements, such as the dispatching of Osama bin Laden. The nation is in bad shape, Daniels said, and he cited two reasons upfront: persistent unemployment and &quot;an unprecedented explosion of spending, with borrowed money.&quot;

            <title>Obama&apos;s Big Six State of the Union Tax Myths  1.25.12</title>
            <description>Taxes: If President Obama wants to create a fairer country, shouldn&apos;t he start by fairly portraying our tax code? Instead, he used his State of the Union speech to peddle a number of blatant tax falsehoods.

In his speech, Obama repeatedly turned to the tax code to explain what&apos;s wrong with the country. It favors the rich, he said. It benefits companies that send jobs abroad. It subsidizes the dirty old oil industry. It&apos;s the cause of our deficit problem. And worst of all, plenty of people and businesses aren&apos;t paying their &quot;fair share.&quot;

None of it is true.

But that hasn&apos;t stopped Obama from repeating them every chance he gets, hoping that no one will notice or that his critics will get tired of correcting the record.

Since we don&apos;t fall into either category, here are the facts behind Obama&apos;s State of the Union tax deceptions.

• &quot;We need to change our tax code so that people like me, and an awful lot of members of Congress, pay our fair share of taxes.&quot;

The claim that the rich don&apos;t pay their fair share is simply untrue. The current tax code is extremely progressive, more progressive in fact than it was back in 1979, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The media elite are under the assumption that all government regulations are good. So when both Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich took shots at Dodd-Frank, NBC News anchor Brian Williams was flabbergasted. He expressed skepticism that its new rules posed any problem.

Gingrich straightened him out, arguing the media and the public don&apos;t know how &quot;bad&quot; the Democrats&apos; law is.

            <description>Constitution: The First Amendment forbids &quot;prohibiting the free exercise&quot; of religion. But a pontificating President Obama would do just that in forcing Catholics to provide contraception and sterilization.

When it comes to the unnecessary and un-American controversy Obama has caused by having his Health and Human Services Department mandate Catholic contraception and sterilization coverage, the Constitution and Catholic teaching are in accord — and united in opposing the president.

The First Amendment explicitly protects the practice of religion. The Catholic Church has consistently taught that contraception and sterilization are to be avoided as grave evils.

            <title>U.S. &apos;Reset&apos; Backfires As Brazil Turns To China   1.24.12</title>
            <description>Diplomacy: President Obama earlier this year hailed a new era of energy cooperation with Brazil, vowing to make America Brazil&apos;s best customer. Brazil&apos;s response? To sell its oil to China. So much for the &quot;reset&quot; in relations.

Hailing Brazil as &quot;a global leader&quot; in a visit so important to him he refused to postpone it even though it happened on the same March day he was sending U.S. troops into harm&apos;s way in Libya, Obama put Brazil on a pedestal.

&quot;It&apos;s time for the United States to treat our engagement with Brazil on economic issues as seriously as we do with nations like China and India,&quot; he declared on arrival in Brasilia. &quot;The United States doesn&apos;t simply recognize Brazil&apos;s rise; we support it enthusiastically.&quot;

            <title>Congress Can Constitutionally Skirt Obama On Keystone   1.24.12</title>
            <description>Energy: The president might think that he&apos;s killed the Keystone XL pipeline, at least for as long as he&apos;s in office. But he could be very wrong.

President Obama was able to snuff out the project and with it a vast supply of needed crude because the executive office has traditionally handled permits on cross-border facilities, which the pipeline is considered since it would originate in Canada.

But that doesn&apos;t mean that&apos;s the only way for the pipeline to be approved. Attorneys at the Congressional Research Service have determined that lawmakers can pass a bill requiring a permit for the pipeline — which would have carried crude that will now instead be shipped by a rail line owned by Warren Buffett, one of Obama&apos;s supporters.

            <description>Homeland Security: To please Muslim-rights groups, more and more colleges are hiring Muslim chaplains, only to watch them radicalize students. Campuses need tougher background checks.

Alarmingly, some chaplains have actively supported al-Qaida and called for violent jihad against &quot;kaffirs,&quot; or infidels. And yet they still have access to students, and remain on the university payroll.

Take Imam Abdullah Faaruuq, Muslim chaplain at Northeastern University in Boston. He has urged Muslims to pick up the &quot;gun and sword&quot; on behalf of recently imprisoned al-Qaida terrorists.

            <description>Blame Game: News reports about a December 2008 White House stimulus memo claim it proves the stimulus was too small. What it really does is expose how Obama has misled the country about his economic policies.

The memo, written by Larry Summers — President Obama&apos;s top economic adviser at the time — shortly after the election, outlined the thinking of his economic team about the best size and make-up of a stimulus package.

News reports about the memo, which came to light this week, have focused on Summers&apos; warnings that the government could spend only so much money in any given year, suggesting that this is why the stimulus was too small to be truly effective.

            <title>Gingrich And The Battle For American Exceptionalism  1.23.12</title>
            <description>Election 2012: After a stunning South Carolina primary victory, the former speaker of the House rightly defines the battle ahead as one between the America envisioned by our Founding Fathers and the radicalism practiced by our president.

Alinsky, the far-left father of modern community organizing, is not a name you&apos;ll see falling from the lips of the liberal media elites. Newt Gingrich said during a recent debate he was tired of their defending the failed administration of President Obama. They&apos;re more concerned about Gingrich&apos;s ex-wives than with the ideological roots of an administration led by a former community organizer steeped in Alinsky radicalism.

Few paid much attention when candidate Barack Obama told a rally shortly before the 2008 election that he was five days away from fundamentally transforming America. That was Alinsky&apos;s goal, too, and Obama would become the disciple and instrument of Alinsky-inspired policies that would put a foreclosure sign in front of Ronald Reagan&apos;s shining city on a hill.

            <title>Dems: Let Government Determine Reasonable Profits  1.23.12</title>
            <description>Big Oil: In the annals of stupid legislation, add a proposal from House liberals that would set up a &quot;Reasonable Profits Board&quot; to decide when oil companies have made too much money. We pay lawmakers for this?

The &quot;Gas Price Spike Act&quot; is really just a warmed over windfall profits tax proposal. Sponsor Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, says it would &quot;tax only excess profits&quot; (at rates ranging from 50% to 100%) and use the money to subsidize politically correct cars and mass transit.

But how do you define an &quot;excess&quot; or, for that matter, a &quot;reasonable&quot; profit? Ah, they&apos;ve cleverly thought that through. As the bill clearly explains: &quot;the term &apos;reasonable profit&apos; means the amount determined by the Reasonable Profits Board to be a reasonable profit.&quot;

            <description>Election &apos;12: In a scandal reeking of electoral fraud, a Democrat-linked political hack was arrested Friday for identity theft in an apparent bid to defame and replace Iowa&apos;s GOP secretary of state. How far up does this go?

Zachary Edwards, who served as President Obama&apos;s Iowa &quot;New Media Director,&quot; and a campaign organizer in critical battleground states such as North Carolina and New Mexico during 2008&apos;s elections, apparently has quite a range of uses to the Democratic Party.

One of those uses may include identity theft.

            <description>Leadership: If State of the Union speech leaks are any indication, the president wants his re-election campaign to be about fairness. But why should anyone believe him, since his own policies have made America much less fair?

&apos;We can go in two directions,&quot; Obama told supporters in a State of the Union preview over the weekend. &quot;One is towards less opportunity and less fairness. Or we can fight for where I think we need to go: building an economy that works for everyone, not just a wealthy few.&quot;

But Obama has miserably failed even by his own definition of fairness. Under his administration, the only ones winning are the rich and well connected. Everyone else continues to suffer.

            <title>Democrats&apos; Three Years Of No Budget Is All About Deception   1.23.12</title>
            <description>Congress: The last time the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate passed a budget was April 29, 2009 — 1,000 days ago. It&apos;s no mystery why: They don&apos;t want taxpayers to know about the trillions they&apos;re wasting.

A published budget would be an election-year death warrant for Senate Democrats, because Republican Senate candidates would stuff its highlights into every mailbox they could.

As Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., points out, going budget-less for so long has devastated our economy as Democrats have spent &quot;$9.4 trillion and added $4.1 trillion to the national debt,&quot; plus over $1 trillion in deficits.

            <itunes:summary>Congress: The last time the Democratic-controlled U.S. Senate passed a budget was April 29, 2009 — 1,000 days ago. It&apos;s no mystery why: They don&apos;t want taxpayers to know about the trillions they&apos;re wasting.

A published budget would be an election-year death warrant for Senate Democrats, because Republican Senate candidates would stuff its highlights into every mailbox they could.

As Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., points out, going budget-less for so long has devastated our economy as Democrats have spent &quot;$9.4 trillion and added $4.1 trillion to the national debt,&quot; plus over $1 trillion in deficits.</itunes:summary>

            <title>U.S., European Nuclear Sanctions &amp; It&apos;s About Time   1.23.12</title>
            <description>Mideast: Europe imposes a ban on Iran&apos;s oil imports while a multinational armada led by the U.S. steams for the Strait of Hormuz. Is the world finally getting serious about confronting the world&apos;s worst terrorist regime?

Spurred by Iran&apos;s continued development of a nuclear weapon, the U.S. and its European allies seem intent on acting — after years of dithering and looking the other way as Iran built its nuclear know-how.

The European Union&apos;s announcement on Monday that members would freeze the assets of Iran&apos;s central bank in Europe while also banning all new oil contracts with the mullahs is particularly significant.

            <title>Gingrich Looking Churchillian In Political Comeback   1.20.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: A great debater. Politically polarizing. Prone to great error, but also prone to spectacular success. Steeped in history. Politically brilliant. Unorthodox. Audacious.

All these qualities were once used to describe Winston Churchill. Today, you might use the same words to describe Newt Gingrich. Sound absurd? Not when you think about it.

Churchill, like Gingrich, was a brilliant politician with a powerful sense of the occasion.

Sometimes prickly, often witty, but never dull, his career had lots of ups and downs — ranging from being blamed for the disastrous Gallipoli campaign in World War I to being credited as the father of the British welfare state — not exactly a compliment among conservatives, then or now.

Indeed, by Churchill&apos;s own admission, &quot;The Conservatives have never liked nor trusted me.&quot; The same thing can be said of Gingrich, who has had a tortured relationship with the GOP&apos;s conservative wing, to say the least.

And yet, when his nation called on him to lead in 1940, Churchill was ready — the right man for the right time. With America&apos;s government under President Obama moving rapidly to the extreme left, Gingrich too might be the right man for the right time.

Churchill, like Gingrich, stayed around long enough to acquire wisdom and insight about world affairs and the economy. From 1931 on, Churchill wasn&apos;t fooled at all by Hitler. &quot;The Nazi regime,&quot; he said in a speech reprinted in &quot;The Unrelenting Struggle,&quot; &quot;is indistinguishable from the worst features of Communism.&quot;

            <title>First Obama Re-Election Ad Filled With Fibs   1.20.12</title>
            <description>Energy: In his very first TV ad of the 2012 campaign, the president is feeding the public false information about America&apos;s dependence on foreign fuels. His twisted statistics actually celebrate the Obama recession.

The Obama re-election campaign is already shaping up as the most deceitful in American electoral history. &quot;For the first time in 13 years our dependence on foreign oil is below 50%,&quot; the commercial declares, accompanied by goose-bumpy music.

Major economic downturns, in fact, unfailingly produce declines in oil imports. And so do higher gas prices — which went from an average of less than $2 a gallon at the time Obama took office to nearly $4 in the middle of last year and remain well above $3 today.

How could gasoline demand not drop with so many people out of work, businesses dying and jittery investors sitting on a trillion dollars?

Obama&apos;s ad dishonestly suggests he&apos;s been engineering an alternative energy economic renaissance in America. As hard-hatted workers are shown assembling solar panels, the ad says, &quot;America&apos;s clean energy industry? 2.7 million jobs and expanding rapidly.&quot;

It&apos;s saying Obama created — or &quot;saved&quot; — 2.7 million new clean energy jobs, right? Uh-uh. Turns out that the Brookings Institution report that the ad cites as its source on the 2.7 million was referring to already-existing green jobs.

            <title>Mexico&apos;s Murderous Drug War Spills Over U.S. Border  1.20.12</title>
            <description>The Border: Eighteen months ago, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer was excoriated for warning of spillover from Mexico&apos;s war reaching our soil. Well, beheadings are becoming common now. Yet that war is still ignored.

Leading the charge in the summer of 2010, Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank blasted Republican Gov. Brewer for claiming that Arizona&apos;s &quot;law enforcement agencies have found bodies in the desert either buried or just lying out there that have been beheaded.&quot;

Brewer did admit she was in error at the time, but that&apos;s not what really interested Milbank and his fellow media minions.

In his column, Milbank cast Brewer&apos;s claim as misinformation intended to scare people into thinking violence from illegal immigration is worse than it actually is.

&quot;Border violence on the rise? Phoenix becoming the world&apos;s No. 2 kidnapping capital? Illegal immigrants responsible for most police killings? The majority of those crossing the border are drug mules? All wrong,&quot; Milbank wrote.

He wasn&apos;t the only one to pile on — CBS and the Guardian also jumped in.

Just one problem, though. Brewer may have jumped the gun months ago, but cartel beheadings have become a reality in Arizona — and are now jumping to other states.

            <title>Franklin Raines, Ghost Defendant  1.20.12</title>
            <description>Subprime Scandal: Obama adviser Franklin Raines is glaringly absent from an SEC lawsuit against Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives for defrauding investors. How convenient.

Raines first plunged Fannie into the subprime abyss as its chairman and chief executive from 1999 to 2005 while cooking the mortgage giant&apos;s books to score fatter bonuses for himself and other Democrats on its board.

In its complaint against Fannie, however, the Obama administration covers only the period from 2006 to 2008 and names Raines&apos; successor and former protege, Daniel Mudd, as the main defendant. Raines is nowhere to be found in the SEC&apos;s 60-page court filing.

Instead, Mudd and two of his top aides are accused of covering up the full extent of Fannie&apos;s subprime exposure. But that exposure and cover-up began under Raines, who rolled out Fannie&apos;s first subprime mortgage line, known as Expanded Approval.

The program let Fannie&apos;s customers rubberstamp borrowers who would have been formerly classified as &quot;Refer with Caution&quot; by Fannie&apos;s automated underwriting system.

Raines had Fannie buy billions of dollars worth of the risky mortgages, which were described in internal emails as &quot;clearly subprime,&quot; to meet &quot;affordable housing&quot; quotas set by HUD. In May 2001, Mudd wrote a memo to his boss warning that EA loans &quot;are the highest default risk loans we have ever done.&quot;

            <title>Will Unions Occupy Super Bowl Over Right To Work?   1.20.12</title>
            <description>Big Labor: Indiana unions, opposed to becoming the first right-to-work state in the Rust Belt, may disrupt Super Bowl XLVI in Indianapolis. Their unnecessary roughness will cost the Hoosiers needed jobs.

On Friday, as the Indiana Senate was scheduled to take up legislation supported by Gov. Mitch Daniels to make Indiana the 23rd right-to-work state, Indiana unions considered copying the disruptive and coercive tactics of Occupy Wall Street to disrupt arguably America&apos;s premier sporting event, the Super Bowl, to be held in Indianapolis on Feb. 5.

As in Wisconsin, where embattled GOP Gov. Scott Walker faces a recall election over his effort to fight excessive union feeding at the public trough, and in South Carolina, a right-to-work state that fought the National Labor Relation Board&apos;s efforts to stop Boeing from expanding there, unions in Indiana are fighting to stop what they see as an encroachment on their power.

The Indiana Senate was waiting for the House to complete its work on the legislation but, in a tactic employed by Democratic state senators in Wisconsin, Democratic representatives in the Indiana House delayed action by simply not showing up.

            <description>Election &apos;12: As Mitt Romney&apos;s loss in Iowa to Rick Santorum shatters the &quot;historic&quot; mantra, Rick Perry withdraws to endorse the former House speaker. The fat lady has not yet sung.

What a difference 24 hours can make in the political arena. One minute Romney looks to be sailing toward the GOP nomination with a third straight win in South Carolina&apos;s primary. Now it may only be one of three.

We may never really know who won the Iowa caucuses, but we do know that Romney&apos;s &quot;historic&quot; wins in both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary deserve an asterisk next to them.

            <itunes:summary>Election &apos;12: As Mitt Romney&apos;s loss in Iowa to Rick Santorum shatters the &quot;historic&quot; mantra, Rick Perry withdraws to endorse the former House speaker. The fat lady has not yet sung.

What a difference 24 hours can make in the political arena. One minute Romney looks to be sailing toward the GOP nomination with a third straight win in South Carolina&apos;s primary. Now it may only be one of three.

We may never really know who won the Iowa caucuses, but we do know that Romney&apos;s &quot;historic&quot; wins in both the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary deserve an asterisk next to them.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Gingrich Becomes Media Target On Eve Of S.C. Vote     1.19.12</title>
            <description>Media: The dominant liberal media are going all out to destroy Newt Gingrich — just as two polls show him overtaking Mitt Romney. It turns out, when a conservative Republican is the target, old news is big news.

The latest polling gives Gingrich front-runner status in South Carolina just days before the state&apos;s crucial primary.

An American Research Group survey conducted earlier this week finds Gingrich at 33%, one point above Romney, while the final Rasmussen Reports South Carolina telephone survey of likely GOP voters gives Gingrich 33%, with Romney at 31%.

            <title>When Will We Awake From Obama&apos;s Bad Green Dream?     1.19.12</title>
            <description>Industrial Policy: The Obama administration promised a future with a clean, green economy. Instead, it&apos;s left us with failed government &quot;investments&quot; in projects driven by politics rather than prudence.

While campaigning for the presidency in 2008, Barack Obama swore he&apos;d create millions of green jobs.

&quot;We&apos;ll invest $15 billion a year over the next decade in renewable energy, creating 5 million new green jobs that pay well, can&apos;t be outsourced and help end our dependence on foreign oil,&quot; he said that fall.

Three years into the Obama presidency, the country has yet to see a wave of green-collar jobs. What it has seen is government pouring taxpayers&apos; money into pet projects that wasted the cash. A particularly sore example is Solyndra, which not only went bankrupt after taking in more than $500 million in taxpayers&apos; dollars, but also became the target of an FBI probe.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Button Men (And Women)     1.19.12</title>
            <description>Media Bias: Journalists like to claim they speak truth to power. But when Barack Obama wields that power, they&apos;re all too willing to do his bidding, even if it means attacking one of their own. Just ask Jodi Kantor.

Kantor&apos;s book, &quot;The Obamas,&quot; is hardly some right-wing hit piece. She&apos;s a New York Times correspondent who spent years interviewing hundreds of Obama staffers and associates to compile a book focused on Michelle and Barack&apos;s relationship and the inner workings of the White House.

But Kantor did manage to unearth some less than flattering tidbits, such as the Halloween extravaganza the Obamas threw themselves in 2009 — when unemployment was 10% — and then hushed up; or the strife between Michelle and former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel; or the fact that former press secretary Robert Gibbs &quot;had a tense relationship&quot; with the first lady.

            <title>Jobs Vs. Greens? On Keystone Obama Chooses His Base  1.18.12</title>
            <description>Energy: President Obama&apos;s rejection of the Keystone XL oil pipeline sums up his presidency. When it comes down to well-paying new jobs and cheaper energy vs. his political base, guess which wins.

The 1,700-mile TransCanada Keystone crude oil pipeline from Alberta to the Gulf Coast is a no-brainer. Canada&apos;s oil sands are the largest source of crude oil outside the Middle East and the 700,000 barrels of black gold per day the pipeline would bring would mean hundreds of thousands of new jobs, lower gasoline prices, less U.S. dependence on Mideast oil and hundreds of millions of dollars in increased revenues for the states.

All those high-salaried jobs are why both Democratic-supporting labor unions and Republican-supporting business interests are pro-Keystone.

Yet, instead of supporting it in a spirit of bipartisanship, the &quot;Great Uniter&quot; had a State Department flunky announce his opposition on Wednesday.

The administration&apos;s claim that the congressional Feb. 21 deadline makes &quot;adequate review&quot; impossible is disingenuous; the Keystone application was submitted three years ago and last year, the State Department held nine public meetings in the six states through which the pipeline would pass, as well as in Washington, D.C.

            <title>Climate Change Doubts Heat Up the Classroom  1.18.12</title>
            <description>Climate Change: Teachers reportedly are getting push-back on middle and high school curricula that fuel the speculation that man is warming the planet. Their frustration is almost worthy of a celebration.

Earlier this week, the Los Angeles Times recounted teachers&apos; experiences with global warming instruction. The Washington bureau noted that &quot;scientists and educators report mounting resistance to the study of man-made climate change in middle and high schools&quot; and declared that &quot;a flash point has emerged in American science education.&quot;

Frank Niepold, identified as &quot;climate education coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who meets with hundreds of teachers annually,&quot; described for the Times what he has seen in these exchanges.

&quot;Any time we have a meeting of 100 teachers, if you ask whether they&apos;re running into push-back on teaching climate change, 50 will raise their hands,&quot; Niepold said. &quot;We ask questions about how sizable it is, and they tell us it is (sizable) and pretty persistent, from many places: your administration, parents, students, even your own family.&quot;

Apparently, teachers expected to be free to indoctrinate their students. But they have run into dissent. And this is encouraging: If Niepold&apos;s observation is representative of the nation as a whole, then roughly half of Americans are apparently skeptical of the global warming claim.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Wayward Chief Of Staff   1.18.12</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: The president has staked his re-election bid on the claim that GOP deregulation of Wall Street caused a crisis he can&apos;t fix. But even his own chief of staff isn&apos;t buying it.

Jacob Lew, former budget director and Hillary Clinton loyalist, wasn&apos;t Obama&apos;s first choice to replace Bill Daley, who resigned abruptly as chief of staff. Daley was supposed to stay on through the election, managing the campaign from the White House.

Now the president has someone in that key role who, unknown to many even inside the Beltway, rejects the central premise of his propaganda campaign against Republicans. Obama is loath to admit it, but Lew has denied that Wall Street deregulation caused the recession, a view that is completely off-message.

Just last year, in little-noticed testimony, Lew rankled Senate Democrats when he refused to go along with their spin regarding the root causes of the crisis. The defection occurred during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Budget Committee.

            <title>Media Push Myths About Mitt Romney&apos;s 15% Tax Rate  1.18.12</title>
            <description>Taxes: Mitt Romney&apos;s admission that his effective tax rate is around 15% prompted the usual class warfare rage from the left. But it also prompted news reports to repeat several myths about the country&apos;s income tax code.

As CNN put it in the first paragraph of its story, Romney&apos;s 15% tax rate means &quot;the multimillionaire pays a smaller percentage of taxes on his income than many middle-income Americans.&quot;

This is a favorite canard of the left these days — that the super-rich often pay taxes at lower rates than do struggling middle-class families.

It was propelled by Warren Buffett, who claimed that his tax rate was lower than his secretary&apos;s, prompting President Obama to quickly propose a &quot;Buffett rule&quot; surtax on millionaires.

But like many &quot;facts&quot; about the tax code, this one evaporates upon closer inspection.

First, it&apos;s simply false that Romney&apos;s tax rate is lower than &quot;many middle-income Americans.&quot; The middle 20% of income earners pay taxes at an average rate of just 2.3%. The next highest 20% pay at an average rate of only 6.1%.

Even when you include payroll taxes, the effective rate for families in the middle of the income spectrum is less than 13%, according to data from the Tax Policy Center.

Call them &quot;sons of net neutrality,&quot; for while the Software Online Piracy Act (SOPA) working its way through the House of Representatives and its Senate companion, the Protect IP Act (PIPA), are shrouded in seemingly worthy goals, they would grant government power it should not have and arguably pose a threat to our First Amendment rights.

Online piracy is a real problem, and the goal of protecting copyrighted material from unlawful copying and dissemination is something we support, just as we support free and unfettered access to the Internet.

But, as in the case of net neutrality, the ends do not justify the means.

Under net neutrality, a concept pushed by President Obama&apos;s Federal Communications Commission, the FCC proposed taking for itself the power to regulate how Internet providers manage their networks and how they serve their customers.

            <title>High-Speed Rail in Calif.: What Price Behavior Mod?  1.17.12</title>
            <description>High-Speed Rail: Spending $100 billion on bullet trains that may or may not get some people out of their cars isn&apos;t transformative, just wasteful. So why is California&apos;s governor still on board?

Back in April 2009, Barack Obama was still in his yes-we-can mode, and he had this to say about his vision for high-speed rail: &quot;Imagine whisking through towns at speeds over 100 miles an hour, walking only a few steps to public transportation, and ending up just blocks from your destination. Imagine what a great project that would be to rebuild America.&quot;

Coming on three years later, that rail system remains today what it was then: imaginary. And it seems likelier and likelier to stay that way. Despite the administration&apos;s commitment of $10 billion in federal stimulus money and tub-thumping for bullet trains, high-speed rail looks like an idea whose time has passed, or will never arrive.

            <description>Election 2012: Whatever one thinks of GOP candidate Newt Gingrich, there&apos;s no doubt he scored big in the weekend&apos;s South Carolina debate. That kind of energy and command of facts is what it will take to win the presidency.

After falling in the polls under a barrage of big-money attack ads from opponent Mitt Romney, and stumbling on a bad campaign ad of his own over Romney’s record at Bain Capital, Gingrich surprised many with his best debate performance yet.

He soared in the Fox News/Wall Street Journal debate Saturday by getting back to basics: articulating the elements of the Reagan Revolution. No wonder he got the first standing ovation ever at a debate.

            <description>Media Bias: A presidential infomercial posing as a news magazine distorts the record to shamelessly shill for a failed administration. Why do we criticize the man who made the high-speed trains run on time?

Political campaigns call it free media: when candidates can make their case and communicate their message through interviews and outlets that don&apos;t cost a dime.

It helps when a mainstream media sycophant like Andrew Sullivan gets to write a puff piece in Newsweek with the subtle title of &quot;Why Are The President&apos;s Critics So Dumb?&quot; The Democratic National Committee couldn&apos;t have said it better.

            <title>Despite Past Failures, Fed Looks To Print More Money  1.13.12</title>
            <description>Recovery: The media have busied themselves with touting the big economic rebound they see brewing in the U.S. We hope they&apos;re right. But if they are, why is the Federal Reserve getting ready to print even more money?

The media argument goes like this: After years of struggling, the economy is finally churning out jobs. Last month alone there were 200,000 new ones, with unemployment falling to 8.5% — its lowest since Obama entered office.

This comes as a variety of U.S. economic sectors begin to show signs of life. And as they report this, the mainstream media can barely conceal their glee at the idea that Republican candidates might have to run against President Obama during an economic boom.

Boom? Well, the Fed doesn&apos;t see it that way.

Alarmed at the economy&apos;s slow pace, the ongoing slump in housing and the threat of European debt defaults, the central bank is preparing a third round of &quot;quantitative easing&quot; — the monetary equivalent of a defibrillator paddle placed on the economy&apos;s chest.

This is rather strange, given that the previous two attempts — QE1 and QE2— did little to help the economy. Indeed, those efforts may have so distorted markets and interest rates that they held back the recovery.

But say this for the Fed: It didn&apos;t sit on its hands. In those first two QE efforts, it bought $2 trillion of government-backed mortgage securities and federal bonds.

            <title>Businesses Need Relief From Obama, Not Gov&apos;t Reorg    1.13.12</title>
            <description>Business: After pushing through one of the largest expansions of government in history, the president now claims he wants to streamline it on behalf of struggling businesses. Pardon us if we&apos;re skeptical about his sincerity.

On Friday, Obama pushed Congress to give him the authority to reorganize several government agencies, merging six that deal with trade and business development. The idea, he claims, is to cut duplication and red tape to make it &quot;easier to do business in America.&quot; As a bonus, Obama says this will trim spending by $3 billion over a decade.

Obama&apos;s sudden realization that the federal government is a bloated mess is welcome. There&apos;s no shortage of targets at which to aim. But his proposal should be seen for what it is: a crass political move designed to inoculate himself against charges that he&apos;s anti-business.

After all, if these reforms are so important to companies, why did Obama wait three years to propose them, or wait a full year after promising such changes in his last State of the Union address, knowing Congress would never get it done in an election year?

It&apos;s just as well, since once you scratch the surface, you realize Obama&apos;s reorg would almost certainly do more harm than good. Of particular concern is his plan to mash the lean and effective U.S. Trade Representative office together with the bloated and aimless Commerce Department.

            <title>Occupy Turns From Protest To Piracy With Disruptions  1.13.12</title>
            <description>Trade: While claiming to hate banks, Occupy protestors have a creepy penchant for disrupting sea traffic. Their new plan is to halt ships in Washington state. Now Coast Guard escorts are being called in. It&apos;s not enough. This is piracy.

It&apos;s time elected leaders interested in a functioning economy got tough with the fringe lunatics of Occupy who insist on interfering with the livelihoods of others without any consequences to themselves.

Coddled by President Obama, left-wing local governments, mainstream media and Big Labor, Occupy has taken this soft underbelly of establishment support as a license to act in increasingly lawless ways, hurting the very working people they purport to champion.

They&apos;re now openly disrupting trade, vowing to stop shipping at the port of Longview, Wash. In normal civilizations this is known as piracy.

Seems it wasn&apos;t enough to inflict crime, pestilence, noise, perversion, drugs use, property-rights violations, freeloading, pollution and even excrement across the country in months of protests last year.

Longview, Wash., which bills itself as having the West Coast&apos;s most efficient grain terminal, now faces a shutdown.

Occupy Longview &quot;organizer&quot; Paul Nipper has issued a nationwide call for protestors to gather at the gates of the port and block any efforts to load the ships.

            <title>Keystone XL Pipeline And Jobs — Put Up Or Shut Up   1.13.12</title>
            <description>Politics: The day after the president announces he would reward businesses that bring jobs into the U.S., the Chamber of Commerce asks: What about the pipeline from Canada that would bring both jobs and energy?

The irony was mind-boggling when President Obama addressed a group of business leaders at the White House last Wednesday on his plans to reward &quot;insourcing.&quot;

&quot;There are workers ready to work right now,&quot; he told them. &quot;In the next few weeks, I will put forward new tax proposals that reward companies that choose to bring jobs home and invest in America — and eliminate tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas. Because there is opportunity to be had right here.&quot;

Indeed, there are opportunities right now for companies to bring jobs to the U.S. and workers ready to fill them, as U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue reminded Obama the next day during his &quot;State of American Business 2012&quot; address.

&quot;We can put 20,000 Americans to work right away and up to 250,000 over the life of the project,&quot; Donohue said. &quot;Labor unions and the business community alike are urging President Obama to act in the best interests of our national security and our workers, and approve the pipeline.&quot;

It would be in the president&apos;s best political interests as well, helping lower energy prices and creating jobs in an economy struggling to do so. Even a number of unions, a major part of the Democratic base, are backing the project.

            <itunes:summary>Politics: The day after the president announces he would reward businesses that bring jobs into the U.S., the Chamber of Commerce asks: What about the pipeline from Canada that would bring both jobs and energy?

The irony was mind-boggling when President Obama addressed a group of business leaders at the White House last Wednesday on his plans to reward &quot;insourcing.&quot;

&quot;There are workers ready to work right now,&quot; he told them. &quot;In the next few weeks, I will put forward new tax proposals that reward companies that choose to bring jobs home and invest in America — and eliminate tax breaks for companies that move jobs overseas. Because there is opportunity to be had right here.&quot;

Indeed, there are opportunities right now for companies to bring jobs to the U.S. and workers ready to fill them, as U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue reminded Obama the next day during his &quot;State of American Business 2012&quot; address.

&quot;We can put 20,000 Americans to work right away and up to 250,000 over the life of the project,&quot; Donohue said. &quot;Labor unions and the business community alike are urging President Obama to act in the best interests of our national security and our workers, and approve the pipeline.&quot;

It would be in the president&apos;s best political interests as well, helping lower energy prices and creating jobs in an economy struggling to do so. Even a number of unions, a major part of the Democratic base, are backing the project.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Haiti Needs Economic Freedom, Not More Failed Aid 1.12.12</title>
            <description>Aid: One year after Haiti&apos;s devastating 7.0 earthquake, calls are going out to the U.S. to give more. They come after Oxfam reported that after $12 billion in aid, Haiti is still a ruin. Clearly, this is a problem money can&apos;t solve.

No one responded to news of the terrible earthquake that hit the capital of the hemisphere&apos;s poorest country quite as magnificently as America did.

The U.S. military moved swiftly and dispensed millions in critical aid to a country whose port and presidential palace lay in ruins. President Obama assured Haitians: &quot;You will not be abandoned,&quot; and named ex-Presidents Clinton and Bush to lead the U.S. effort.

            <description>Economy: Another year, another step down on the ladder for America — on the Index of Economic Freedom, that is — as the U.S. continues to lose ground to other countries.

More than any other country, the U.S. can lay claim to being the home of economic freedom. Our giant economy was, to an extent greater than any other, built on free markets and free people, an inspiration to the world. It&apos;s a major reason we&apos;re the wealthiest nation on Earth.

Sadly, in recent years our freedom has waned.

            <description>Politics: The DNC&apos;s chairwoman, a champion of Occupy Wall Street, once again associates the tragedy in Tucson with an end to civil discourse caused by the grass-roots Tea Party movement. Has she no shame?

There she goes again. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla, head of the Democratic National Committee and the &quot;Debbie Downer&quot; of American politics, has repeated the canard that somehow the shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., a year ago at a Tucson event is somehow linked to hatred spawned by the Tea Party.

&quot;We need to make sure that we tone things down, particularly in light of the Tucson tragedy from a year ago, where my very good friend, Gabby Giffords — who is doing really well, by the way — (was shot),&quot; Wasserman Schultz said at an event hosted by the New England Council and New Hampshire Institute of Politics.

            <description>Overregulation: Carmakers are showing who&apos;s really behind the wheel of the industry at this year&apos;s Detroit auto show. And, no, it&apos;s not car buyers. It&apos;s federal regulators.

At the industry&apos;s premier trade show, carmakers rolled out one hybrid and plug-in model after another to indicate where the industry is headed. But this display of electric love isn&apos;t because consumers want such cars. In fact, they&apos;ve made it pretty clear they don&apos;t. Some recent evidence:

• Sales of gas-electric hybrids comprised a tiny 2.2% of the market in 2011 — and that&apos;s down 2.4% from the year before.

            <description>Environmentalism: As the light bulb phaseout goes into effect, you may be surprised to know the law also requires their already-costly replacements to be phased out too.

That&apos;s right, new light bulb efficiency standards set by Washington also mandate light bulbs become 70% more efficient than classic bulbs by 2020. The only bulbs that meet that higher standard are light-emitting diodes, or LEDs. And they are even more expensive than compact fluorescent lamps.

CFLs will replace incandescent bulbs to meet the first level of efficiency that&apos;s been widely reported in the media. By 2014, household bulbs using between 40 and 100 watts will need to consume at least 28% less energy under a stupid law passed by Congress in 2007.

            <title>Romney Needs To Teach Some Capitalism 101  1.11.12</title>
            <description>The Economy: Where do jobs come from? That facts-of-life question is central to the coming presidential contest. And if you get what Bain Capital does, you know the answer.

We&apos;ve heard more times than we can count that the 2012 election will be about jobs and the economy. That&apos;s true enough. It&apos;s also shaping up as something deeper — a referendum on free enterprise.

The question is stark and simple: Does America want to place its economic future in the hands of the market or government?

Mitt Romney&apos;s progress toward a commanding lead in the Republican nomination process has done a great deal to clarify the question and make the voters&apos; choice clear. Not only does he argue the case for free-market capitalism, but he also embodies it in his career.

Depending on your analysis, his 15 years in charge of the private-equity firm Bain Capital are a badge of honor or a target on his back — or both. In any event, they put him on one side of the economic debate.

On the other side is the government-knows-best ideology of the Obama administration. This is the mindset behind the 2009 stimulus bill, high-speed rail and Solyndra, among other dubious commitments of taxpayers&apos; money.

            <title>Do Unconventional Tactics Mark Start Of War On Iran?  1.11.12</title>
            <description>Conflict: As Iran&apos;s despot clowned with Latin dictators, someone was playing hardball back home, taking out another nuclear scientist. At the same time, the U.S. Navy won Iranian hearts and minds with two sea rescues. A war is on.

We would&apos;ve loved to see the look on Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&apos;s face when, fresh from cracking nuclear bomb jokes with Venezuela&apos;s Hugo Chavez, he was informed that another nuclear scientist, Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a chemist who ran the Natanz nuclear enrichment center in central Iran, had met his end the same way as three other bomb-making Iranian nuclear scientists — with a motorcycle team slapping a magnetic bomb onto his car and speeding off as it blew up.

Ahmadinejad had just sought to convince the world that Iran was no threat — just another buffoon-state like Chavez&apos;s Venezuela, and thus its nuclear ambitions posed no threat.

His mocking statements with the Marxist Chavez — that they had a nuclear bomb buried under Venezuela&apos;s Miraflores presidential palace — were meant to build support for the idea that there is no Iranian threat.

But reality intruded as someone — possibly Israeli intelligence forces — dispensed with Roshan in a dead-serious move rooted in the self-defense of a nation under existential threat.

            <title>Romney&apos;s Wins Belie Media Myths About His Candidacy   1.11.12</title>
            <description>Primaries: Among other things, Mitt Romney&apos;s big victory in New Hampshire has served to crush a lot of myths about his campaign — especially the idea he can&apos;t attract bedrock Republican voters. He can.

Sure, Mitt won handily in New Hampshire, with almost 40% of the vote — with Ron Paul, at No. 2, nearly 17 percentage points behind him.

Even so, a much repeated meme among the mainstream media was that Mitt Romney couldn&apos;t attract enough enthusiastic support from GOP conservatives — the party&apos;s base — to beat Obama in 2012.

Following Mitt&apos;s win, some media pundits asserted it really wasn&apos;t much of a win at all — that turnout was low, and that the enthusiasm for his candidacy is water-thin among rank and file Republicans, independents and the Tea Party.

Both of these are false.

As Townhall columnist Guy Benson noted, contrary to repeated assertions to the contrary, &quot;voters turned out in record numbers yesterday, setting a new GOP primary turnout record in the Granite State by eclipsing 2008&apos;s tally by several thousand votes.&quot;

            <title>A Celebrating Romney Says Obama Is Out Of Time   1.11.12</title>
            <description>We remember when Barack Obama came to New Hampshire four years ago. He promised to bring people together. He promised to change the broken system in Washington. He promised to improve our nation.

Those were the days of lofty promises made by a hopeful candidate. Today, we are faced with the disappointing record of a failed president. The last three years have held a lot of change, but they haven&apos;t offered much hope.

The middle class has been crushed. Nearly 24 million of our fellow Americans are still out of work, struggling to find work or have just stopped looking. The median income has dropped 10% in four years. Soldiers returning from the front lines are waiting in unemployment lines. Our debt is too high and our opportunities too few.

And this president wakes up every morning, looks out across America and is proud to announce, &quot;It could be worse.&quot; It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse? Of course not.

            <title>Media to Blame for HalloweenGate Cover-Up   1.10.12</title>
            <description>Media: The White House is now taking hits for trying to downplay a lavish Halloween party the Obamas threw themselves amid an economic crisis. But what about the reporters who dutifully complied with the cover-up?

In her new book, &quot;The Obamas,&quot; New York Times correspondent Jodi Kantor relays a story about how the White House communications staff wanted to keep the 2009 party under wraps.

No wonder. Had the fact that they were holding an extravagant &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;-theme party — decorated with the help of director Tim Burton and featuring Johnny Depp in his Mad Hatter costume — at a time of 10% joblessness, it would have caused an outrage.

Some 45 million people watched Denver Broncos quarterback Tim Tebow complete that 80-yard touchdown pass play to Demaryius Thomas on the first play from scrimmage in overtime to lead his team over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Sunday&apos;s wild card playoff game.

They also saw him take a knee and give thanks to the God he believes in, an act that&apos;s been dubbed &quot;Tebow-ing.&quot;

            <description>Politics: In a telltale Friday-night document dump, the White House released records showing the latest lucky recipients of Obama-Care cost waivers. By the wildest of coincidences, 87% of them belong to Big Labor unions.

Interesting, since Big Labor pulled out all the stops to get the president&apos;s signature on health care reform passed in March 2010. But as the waivers came, it&apos;s clear they never had any expectation of paying for it.

From the very start they carved out special exemptions for themselves, showing all the earmarks of political favors in exchange for campaign contributions. The actual skyrocketing costs, reduced choices and lousy service were shoved on the rest of us.

            <description>Homegrown Terror: The FBI has arrested yet another American Muslim for plotting to kill fellow citizens in the name of Islam. Why is the U.S. Muslim community so uniquely susceptible to violence?

According to a federal affidavit, Sami Osmakac, a 25-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen, planned to use car bombs to blow up Tampa nightclubs, bridges and even a police station. He was arrested over the weekend.

Osmakac said he wanted to instill &quot;more terror&quot; in the hearts of &quot;kaffirs,&quot; or infidels, as &quot;payback&quot; for wrongs done to Muslims. His chilling plan, the FBI says, was to detonate a bomb at a popular Irish pub &quot;where it gets real crowded,&quot; and then hit another target several hours later.

            <description>The Americas: With U.S. attention focused elsewhere, Venezuela&apos;s dictator is at it again — breaking contracts, pushing drugs, plotting cyberattacks and cavorting with Iran&apos;s tyrant. This is what appeasement brings.

Well before President Obama gave President Hugo Chavez a handshake at a 2009 summit, wiser heads at the State Department warned him against a &quot;reset.&quot; Obama ignored them.

The rube-like naivete has now come to bite Obama as the craziness in Caracas spirals wildly in just the last few days. The Rumsfeld Maxim that &quot;weakness is provocative&quot; seems to be operative here, setting the stage for the astonishing string of lawless acts that now demand hard sanctions. Among them:

            <title>We Hope Obama Will Change Gasoline Prices   1.9.12</title>
            <description>Energy: After enduring a holiday season with gasoline prices at all-time highs, Americans are now dealing with record high prices to begin a new year. Does the president plan to do anything?

When Barack Obama took office three years ago, gasoline was less than $2 a gallon. The national city average for a gallon of regular was $1.79. On Monday, that same regular gasoline cost $3.37, the highest mark ever to start a new year and nearly a full quarter higher than the start of 2011.

Consumers probably saw this coming while Christmas shopping. Gasoline hit $3.21 gallon, a record for the season and an increase of 23 cents over the Christmas 2010 price — the previous record, according to the Heritage Foundation, until it was broken in 2011.

            <itunes:summary>Energy: After enduring a holiday season with gasoline prices at all-time highs, Americans are now dealing with record high prices to begin a new year. Does the president plan to do anything?

When Barack Obama took office three years ago, gasoline was less than $2 a gallon. The national city average for a gallon of regular was $1.79. On Monday, that same regular gasoline cost $3.37, the highest mark ever to start a new year and nearly a full quarter higher than the start of 2011.

Consumers probably saw this coming while Christmas shopping. Gasoline hit $3.21 gallon, a record for the season and an increase of 23 cents over the Christmas 2010 price — the previous record, according to the Heritage Foundation, until it was broken in 2011.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama To Betray Missile Defense Secrets To Moscow   1.9.12</title>
            <description>Appeasement: From ObamaCare to recess appointments, honoring the Constitution has not been an administration hallmark. But when it comes to betraying secrets to mollify the Russians, it becomes a document the president hides behind.

It was bad enough that the 2012 defense authorization bill signed by President Obama set America on a downward spiral of military mediocrity.

He also issued a signing statement, something he once opposed, saying that language in the bill aimed at protecting top-secret technical data on the U.S. Standard Missile-3 — linchpin of our missile defense — might impinge on his constitutional foreign-policy authority.

            <title>Devil In Details Of Egypt Brotherhood&apos;s Party Platform   1.9.12</title>
            <description>Mideast: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton insists Egypt&apos;s Muslim Brotherhood seeks &quot;democratic reforms&quot; and sees no reason not to engage its newly formed party. Has she read its platform?

Banned under President Hosni Mubarak, the radical Brotherhood has emerged as a major winner from the rioting that exiled the U.S. ally. Now the Obama administration is breaking with policy and formally reaching out to the group.

It claims the Brotherhood, now operating as the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), has renounced violence and terror. It accepts assurances from its leaders that they&apos;ll build a modern democracy respecting human rights, free trade and Israel&apos;s right to exist.

            <title>What If U.S. Government Got The Bain Treatment?   1.9.12</title>
            <description>Election 2012: Some Republicans are trashing presidential front-runner Mitt Romney because he has practiced in the private sector what they preach. In fact, it wouldn&apos;t be so bad if Washington got the Bain treatment.

It was only a matter of time before Michael Moore would do a number on Mitt Romney and his private equity firm, Bain Capital. Lost jobs, shuttered factories, whole communities laid waste — it sounds like a remake of &quot;Roger &amp; Me,&quot; Moore&apos;s anti-corporate classic of the 1980s.

But wait. That&apos;s not Moore putting out this stuff. It&apos;s Newt Gingrich. It&apos;s Rick Perry. It&apos;s Jon Huntsman. All are taking shots at Mitt Romney for being a practicing capitalist.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Low Expectations On Jobs  1.6.12</title>
            <description>Employment: The White House spins the new job numbers as evidence the economy is coming back from the Bush recession. Truth is, the economy continues to struggle against the weight of Obama&apos;s misguided policies.

Friday&apos;s numbers showed employment climbing 200,000 and the jobless rate dropping for the second month in a row, to 8.5%. Fully 30 months into the recovery, any good jobs news is welcome. But this latest report isn&apos;t much to cheer about. After all, Obama once promised unemployment would be around 6% once his stimulus plan kicked in. And the current rate is still much higher than the post-World War II average of 5.8%.

Still, Obama&apos;s top economic adviser, Alan Krueger, says the report &quot;provides further evidence that the economy is continuing to heal,&quot; and that &quot;it is critical that we continue the economic policies that are helping us to dig our way out of the deep hole.&quot;

As long as the economy shows signs of life, this is sure to be Obama&apos;s signature campaign theme. To wit: Republican laissez-faire policies led to a recession that was so deep it took a very long time to recover. But my policies are working. Stay the course.

            <title>Illegal Aliens, Endless Health Care Bills  1.6.12</title>
            <description>Immigration: An illegal alien just completed 12 surgeries and a record 374-day stay in a Fresno hospital. For him, it was &quot;free&quot; health care. But for taxpayers, the hospital and patients who ultimately pay, it&apos;s another big bill.

Marco Antonio Fuentes had high praise the staff at Community Regional Medical Center who heroically saved his life after he came down with necrotic pancreatitis, a condition that destroyed his intestines. A medical team there rebuilt his gastrointestinal tract, monitored his progress and provided the best of care to him for more than a year.

And the cost? Somewhere in the millions, by all estimates. As an illegal immigrant, he didn&apos;t have to pay a thing. The taxpayers, the charity unit and the other patients will have to foot that bill. Fuentes didn&apos;t have a word of thanks for them.

Fuentes knew enough to recognize that health care is &quot;free&quot; to all illegals in the U.S. and, like millions of other illegals, already considers it an entitlement.

            <title>Gov. Brown&apos;s Tax Hikes Would Kill California Comeback   1.6.12</title>
            <description>The States: As California enters a second decade of decline, its old-new Gov. Jerry Brown has a plan for its revival: A 7% rise in government spending, with a tax hike to match. This is innovative thinking?

To call Brown&apos;s latest plan foolish does a disservice to fools. At least fools make you laugh. After reading Gov. Moonbeam&apos;s latest budget, taxpayers might want to cry.

Under his proposal, Brown would raise taxes on those earning more than $250,000 to 10.3% from 9.3%, while boosting sales taxes to 7.75% from 7.25%.

That&apos;s a $7 billion tax hike mostly on businesses and consumers in a state already hemorrhaging jobs and businesses, and with an unemployment rate over 12%.

In short, insanity.

            <title>Obamalateral Disarmament Dooms Arsenal Of Democracy   1.6.12</title>
            <description>National Security: Portrayed as just a shuffling of priorities, the president&apos;s defense cuts reduce our two-war strategy to maybe one war and cross your fingers. Champagne corks are popping from Beijing to Tehran.

Imagine a scenario in the not-too-distant future when an Iranian Shahab missile mated with an unexpectedly ready nuclear warhead is test-fired and detonates somewhere over the Indian Ocean. The next day Iran closes the Strait of Hormuz as China announces a blockade of Taiwan.

The administration&apos;s defense cuts, or shifts in priorities as President Obama would have us believe, leaves us woefully unprepared for the unexpected in which our enemies, current and potential, are not disarming or cutting their military budgets. Certainly not China, which has been increasing its military spending by double-digit percentages for the last decade.

&quot;We will be strengthening our presence in the Asia-Pacific,&quot; Obama said, &quot;and budget reductions will not come at the expense of that critical region.&quot;

If creating a counterweight to an expansionist China is our goal, why aren&apos;t we selling superior F-22 Raptors to Japan — not to mention building more for ourselves — and selling F-16s to Taiwan?

            <title>Battered Bank Syndrome  1.6.12</title>
            <description>Lending: Bank of America repeatedly caved in to race bullies and still got sued for racism. Now it&apos;s paying them off with another $335 million. Have banks finally learned? Sadly, no.

Judging from the scores of banks settling trumped-up race-bias claims, BofA and the rest of the banking industry will continue to roll over for the same race demagogues who helped create the mortgage crisis and are now sowing seeds of another.

So far only one bank has stood up to Attorney General Eric Holder and his army of diversity cops: Cardinal Bank of Virginia. After Holder recently threatened to sue Cardinal for not opening enough branches in black areas, its CEO vowed to fight the charges in court.

&quot;We would never settle,&quot; Bernard Clineburg said, adding that his bank has a strong track record in minority communities and just last year got high marks from anti-redlining regulators.

Cardinal has just $2 billion in assets, while BofA has trillions. Yet instead of using its heft to fight Holder&apos;s prosecutorial abuse, the nation&apos;s largest bank settled — even as it denied charges its mortgage unit, Countrywide, intentionally discriminated against blacks and Hispanics by &quot;targeting&quot; them for home loans they couldn&apos;t afford.

            <itunes:subtitle>Lending: Bank of America repeatedly caved in to race bullies and still got sued for racism. Now it&apos;s paying them off with another $335 million.</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Lending: Bank of America repeatedly caved in to race bullies and still got sued for racism. Now it&apos;s paying them off with another $335 million. Have banks finally learned? Sadly, no.

Judging from the scores of banks settling trumped-up race-bias claims, BofA and the rest of the banking industry will continue to roll over for the same race demagogues who helped create the mortgage crisis and are now sowing seeds of another.

So far only one bank has stood up to Attorney General Eric Holder and his army of diversity cops: Cardinal Bank of Virginia. After Holder recently threatened to sue Cardinal for not opening enough branches in black areas, its CEO vowed to fight the charges in court.

&quot;We would never settle,&quot; Bernard Clineburg said, adding that his bank has a strong track record in minority communities and just last year got high marks from anti-redlining regulators.

Cardinal has just $2 billion in assets, while BofA has trillions. Yet instead of using its heft to fight Holder&apos;s prosecutorial abuse, the nation&apos;s largest bank settled — even as it denied charges its mortgage unit, Countrywide, intentionally discriminated against blacks and Hispanics by &quot;targeting&quot; them for home loans they couldn&apos;t afford.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama&apos;s Recess Appointments: An Impeachable Offense?   1.5.12</title>
            <description>Constitution: President Obama&apos;s nonrecess &quot;recess appointments&quot; can&apos;t be excused as over-the-top electioneering. This president has crossed over from socialistic extremism into lawlessness and, perhaps, impeachability.

The U.S. Constitution established a strong presidency — so strong that even one of the most esteemed founding fathers, Patrick Henry, worried it would be kinglike. But this week saw a president exceed even those broad constitutional powers because doing so fits his election-year narrative of a &quot;do-nothing Congress&quot; so well.

Now we have the makings of a banana republic, where the rule of clearly written constitutional law is compromised by a ruler&apos;s subjective whim.

            <title>World Bank Economist Blames America For Its Wealth   1.5.12</title>
            <description>Wealth: A World Bank economist is trying to shame the U.S. for being home to one half of the world&apos;s richest people, the so-called 1%. In reality, it&apos;s the world that should be red-faced for not creating wealth as America does.

Bank chief economist Branko Milanovic has come out with a book called &quot;The Haves and the Have Nots,&quot; whose purpose seems to be to argue there&apos;s something wrong about America having an outsized concentration of the world&apos;s wealth.

Implied in the argument is that America&apos;s wealth comes at someone else&apos;s expense, and the solution is to have a bureaucracy redistribute it more to his liking.

            <description>Election &apos;12: The White House responded to the Republican Iowa results by claiming that no matter who won, the extremists were the victors. Does the administration really want to run for re-election on that theme?

While the media were busy trying to tell the public that Mitt Romney&apos;s win Tuesday was actually a loss, the administration teed up another narrative for the press to carry.

President Obama&apos;s campaign manager, Jim Messina, with no regard to reality claimed that the &quot;extremist Tea Party agenda won a clear victory.&quot;

            <description>Defense: The administration announces a leaner version of our military involving the cutting of tens of thousands of ground troops as a leading defense contractor closes a major plant due to budget cuts.

In an unusual appearance at the Pentagon on Thursday, President Obama laid out his plans for a &quot;leaner&quot; military based on the need &quot;to renew our economic strength here at home, which is the foundation of our strength in the world.&quot;

In other words, failed domestic policies require us to cut our military in a dangerous world.

            <description>Bankruptcy: News that Eastman Kodak may file for bankruptcy brought a flood of nostalgia for the venerable company. But Kodak&apos;s demise underscores the unique strength of our free-market economy — its constant renewal.

Sixty-two years after Kodak was founded, economist Joseph Schumpeter popularized the term &quot;creative destruction&quot; to describe a key function of free market economies.

&quot;New consumers, goods, the new methods of production or transportation, the new markets, the new forms of industrial organization&quot; were, he said, constantly creating new industries and new companies, while destroying old ones.

            <title>Media Downplay Big Win For Romney In Iowa   1.4.12</title>
            <description>Election 2012: Because they believe he&apos;ll be the Republican nominee, the dominant media are trying to taint Mitt Romney&apos;s victory in Iowa. In fact, Romney just won a state he was never supposed to win.

No matter how plainly you say something, count on the media to spin it into something else.

Case in point: The very first thing Business Insider politics editor Michael Brendan Dougherty said during a Yahoo News webcast after the narrow Romney triumph in Iowa was: &quot;It means that Mitt Romney is in great shape&quot; — yet somehow the Yahoo News headline for the interview ended up blaring: &quot;The Big Takeaway From Iowa: 75% Of Republicans Don&apos;t Want Mitt Romney.&quot;

Coverage by the Associated Press was headlined &quot;Iowa Win Helps Romney, But Lacks Luster&quot; and began: &quot;Mitt Romney&apos;s whisker-thin Iowa caucus victory was underwhelming in scope and anti-climactic in its finality.&quot;

The New York Times coverage of Romney&apos;s win, meanwhile, asserted that &quot;Despite running a largely mistake-free campaign, Mr. Romney has yet to prove that he can break through the ceiling of support of about 25 % in many polls that has defined his candidacy in a fractured field.&quot;

            <title>Vast Web Of Federal Regulation Causing Drug Shortages   1.4.12</title>
            <description>Health Care: The number of prescription drug shortages shot up to a record 267 in 2011, nearly four times the level of just seven years ago, a new report says. It&apos;s a shortage made in Washington.

The number of drug shortages rose by 56 in 2011 from 211 in 2010, according to a study by the University of Utah Drug Information Service. As recently as 2004, just 58 drugs were in short supply.

&quot;The inability to get crucial medicines has disrupted chemotherapy, surgery and care for patients with infections and pain,&quot; the Associated Press reports.

What happened? As is often the case, government price and output controls are largely to blame for shortages, which have killed at least 15 people since 2010.

Take Medicare. It limits the prices it pays for drugs. But in Medicare&apos;s Plan B, reimbursements to drugmakers often don&apos;t cover the cost of a drug — or shrink profits to such low levels it&apos;s no longer worth making it.

Of course, hospitals still need those drugs. A recent survey found more than half of hospitals routinely buy scarce drugs on the black market — often at exorbitant cost, but without improving the quality of care.

Just as bad, the Food and Drug Administration imposes strict controls on pharmaceutical companies&apos; output.

            <title>Renewable Fuel Standards Formula For Global Poverty  1.4.12</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: There was a reason Congress let ethanol subsidies expire. Legislation mandating using corn as fuel will keep prices high. They will also increase poverty worldwide. Anyone remember the &quot;tortilla riots?&quot;

The Renewable Fuel Standards Program (RFS) was originally passed as part of the Energy Security Act of 2005. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel standard for gasoline and the RFS mandates that at least 37% of the 2011-12 corn crop be converted to ethanol and blended with the gasoline that powers our cars.

&quot;Producing ethanol for use in motor fuels increases the demand for corn, which ultimately raises the prices that consumers pay for a wide variety of foods at the grocery store, ranging from corn-syrup sweeteners in soft drinks to meat, dairy and poultry products,&quot; says the Congressional Budget Office. The RFS program ensures this mandate and ethanol production continues with costs being passed on to consumers at the checkout line and gas pump.

The mandate to burn food in our cars places our corn supply at risk to supply disruptions caused by drought and bad weather. Coming off the third-largest corn harvest in U.S. history in 2010, the carryover (unsold corn still in elevators), constituted only a two-week supply, the lowest level since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.

            <itunes:subtitle>Energy Policy: There was a reason Congress let ethanol subsidies expire. Legislation mandating using corn as fuel will keep prices high. They will also increase poverty worldwide. Anyone remember the &quot;tortilla riots?&quot;</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Energy Policy: There was a reason Congress let ethanol subsidies expire. Legislation mandating using corn as fuel will keep prices high. They will also increase poverty worldwide. Anyone remember the &quot;tortilla riots?&quot;

The Renewable Fuel Standards Program (RFS) was originally passed as part of the Energy Security Act of 2005. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 expanded the renewable fuel standard for gasoline and the RFS mandates that at least 37% of the 2011-12 corn crop be converted to ethanol and blended with the gasoline that powers our cars.

&quot;Producing ethanol for use in motor fuels increases the demand for corn, which ultimately raises the prices that consumers pay for a wide variety of foods at the grocery store, ranging from corn-syrup sweeteners in soft drinks to meat, dairy and poultry products,&quot; says the Congressional Budget Office. The RFS program ensures this mandate and ethanol production continues with costs being passed on to consumers at the checkout line and gas pump.

The mandate to burn food in our cars places our corn supply at risk to supply disruptions caused by drought and bad weather. Coming off the third-largest corn harvest in U.S. history in 2010, the carryover (unsold corn still in elevators), constituted only a two-week supply, the lowest level since the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Acting Like A King Isn&apos;t Among The President&apos;s Duties   1.4.12</title>
            <description>Leadership: A spokesman says the president &quot;can&apos;t wait for Congress to act&quot; and promised that he&apos;s &quot;going to take action.&quot; This is the president who was &quot;ready to rule&quot; in 2008. Is he an elected chief executive or an emperor?

In November 2008, shortly after Barack Obama was elected president, Valerie Jarrett, co-chair of his transition team, appeared on &quot;Meet the Press.&quot; She told host Tom Brokaw that &quot;Obama is prepared to really take power and begin to rule day one.&quot;

Shouldn&apos;t someone who had reached the political heights that Jarrett had reached know that kings rule but presidents are elected to serve and are accountable to Congress, the courts and the voters?

One would think that she and the rest of the administration are aware of a president&apos;s legal limitations, but simply aren&apos;t interested in respecting them.

A little more than three years after Jarrett declared Obama&apos;s majesty, his spokesman Jay Carney warned on the day of the Iowa caucuses that &quot;if Republicans choose the path of obstruction rather than cooperation, then the president is not going to sit here . .. he&apos;s going to take the actions that he can take using his executive authority.&quot;

            <title>Despite Obama&apos;s Failures, He Will Be Tough To Beat  1.3.12</title>
            <description>Election 2012: The Obama presidency may epitomize incompetence, but his campaign will be the slickest, most vicious ever. With so much at stake for America, Republicans better be ready for war.

Gathering in their schools, church halls and neighbors&apos; homes to discuss who should be the Republican standard bearer this year, Iowans had no shortage of timely topics, from jobs to nuclear terror. But this year there&apos;s really only one issue: defeating President Obama. And Republicans shouldn&apos;t kid themselves that it&apos;s going to be easy.

It may seem absurd to imagine Barack Obama could be depicted as a champion of tax cuts, a friend of small business and the scourge of global terrorists. But by this summer, the billion-dollar Obama war chest will saturate the airwaves with such highly polished messages.

            <description>States: California&apos;s in trouble. Businesses are leaving along with intellectual and investment capital and skilled workers. But rather than face up to serious problems, legislators pass silly laws.

One would think that given the serious nature of the state&apos;s problems, the legislature would focus on solutions at the exclusion of all else.

Instead, lawmakers — what would we ever do without them? — found the time in 2011 to trespass even deeper into Californians&apos; personal lives.

            <title>Obama Motors Is on Fire - Literally  1.3.12</title>
            <description>Industrial Policy: President Obama&apos;s electric car vision is off to a hot start. First the heavily subsidized Chevy Volt started catching fire. Then government-backed Fisker Automotive had to recall all its cars due to a fire hazard.

Late last month, Fisker, the electric car startup that is busy spending its $529 million in Department of Energy loans, announced a recall of its entire fleet of luxury Karmas because of a faulty battery that posed a fire risk.

The battery maker at fault — A123 Systems — is another Obama grantee, having gotten $380 million in taxpayer support to make advanced car batteries.

            <description>Bias: A giant TV network has effectively admitted to blackmailing Florida&apos;s GOP Sen. Marco Rubio over his immigration stance. It&apos;s Exhibit A of the kind of sludge being hurled at Latino leaders who won&apos;t toe the open-borders line.

Bigfoot Spanish-language television network Univision unwittingly revealed it&apos;s got a mafia-style hit-equivalent out there waiting for any conservative leader of Hispanic descent who won&apos;t tout their open-borders line on immigration.

So much for reporting the news. Univision&apos;s top honchos behind this are all about politics — and are running their news organization like a cult mafia leader wielding power based on groupthink and fear.

            <description>Success: Away from the low growth and high regulation of an America under Washington&apos;s thumb, our northern neighbor is economically strong. As 2011 ends, Canada has announced yet another tax cut — and will soar even more.

The Obama administration and its economic czars have flailed about for years, baffled about how to get the U.S. economy growing.

In reality, the president need look no further than our neighbor, Canada, whose solid growth is the product of tax cuts, fiscal discipline, free trade, and energy development. That&apos;s made Canada a roaring puma nation, while its supposedly more powerful southern neighbor stands on the outside looking in.

            <description>Journalism: Bloomberg News has published a piece designed to shame GOP White House hopefuls for fingering government housing policy in the crisis. But it&apos;s Bloomberg that needs schooling.

Its lengthy article scoffs at top Republican candidates Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich for laying much of the blame on federal regulations. It argues their view &quot;has been rejected&quot; by the Washington punditry, as well as the Democrat-appointed &quot;commission that investigated the meltdown.&quot;

While true, the prevailing wisdom is dead wrong. And the business wire not only parroted this false Democrat narrative, but conveniently omitted key facts.

            <description>Energy Independence: As our enemy Iran threatens to close a vital waterway for the shipping of oil, plans for a secure, job-creating supply from our ally Canada gather dust on the president&apos;s desk.

The blustering threat from the quite mad Iranian mullahs and their supremely mad leader, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, may be just a bluff, but then again it might not.

It may just be an attempt to intimidate and poke the eye of an American president perceived as weak and whose failure to support and exploit the &quot;Iranian Spring&quot; of 2009 may come back to bite us.

            <description>Corruption: The Obama administration promised a green energy future. What it delivered, though, is a present filled with rancid politics, aching failure and tawdry scandal.

At the top of the list is the Solyndra collapse. President Obama himself visited the California solar panel maker, lauding it for &quot;leading the way toward a brighter, more prosperous future.&quot;

His administration poured $535 million in taxpayer dollars into the business, and wanted to add another $469 million even after it was known the company was going to fail.

            <title>North Korea’s ‘Mourners’: Dehumanized By Communism  12.28.11</title>
            <description>Totalitarianism: The world witnessed a grotesque spectacle Tuesday as millions of North Koreans mourned the death of the world&apos;s most odious dictator. It&apos;s a classic demonstration of the dehumanization of communism.

In the free world, tears would never be shed for a monster like Kim Jong Il, the megalomaniac who ruled North Korea with an iron fist for 17 years, leaving a legacy of man-made famine, a network of Gulag prison camps for free thinkers, and bone-grinding poverty for workers unlike any other place on earth.

But in a reminder of what totalitarianism does to human minds, thousands of North Koreans — mostly soldiers — loudly wailed at the death of the tyrant known as “dear leader.” It’s a reminder this nation remains an enemy state of highly damaged individuals who have no understanding of freedom, a worrisome thing in a nation of nuclear weapons and evil intentions.

            <description>Suffrage: Fresh from using his race as a defense in the Fast and Furious scandal, the attorney general blocks South Carolina&apos;s voter photo ID law as discriminatory. Tell that to the Department of Motor Vehicles.

The Palmetto State can&apos;t seem to catch a break from this administration. First, the right-to-work state gets harassed by the National Labor Relations Board over Boeing&apos;s expansion into a new plant.

Now the Justice Department has blocked a voter ID law passed in May and signed by Gov. Nikki Haley.

            <title>Medicare Reform? Nope — Just Another Doc Fix  12.28.11</title>
            <description>Medicare: Once again, Congress puts off a tough decision on physician fees and shows the failure of top-down cost control. Obama-Care charts a similar path. When will Washington wise up?

Amid the recent political game-playing over the payroll tax, the doctors&apos; lobby was quietly at work on its annual task of persuading Congress not to cut Medicare payments.

As usual, the effort paid off. As it has every year since 2003, Congress agreed to the so-called doc fix, suspending a scheduled Medicare fee cut of 27.4%.

            <title>Democrats Use Fiscal Crisis As Weapon To Bash GOP  12.27.11</title>
            <description>Debt: Wasn&apos;t it just last summer Republicans and Democrats nearly came to blows over raising the debt ceiling? Well, guess what — President Obama is back, asking for another $1.2 trillion. Are we being gamed here?

After last summer&apos;s imbroglio, the debt limit was raised to $15.194 trillion. At the time, in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling, the GOP sought token spending cuts. But on the now widely discredited notion that government spending boosts the economy the Democrats wanted to spend and borrow even more.

Now, with the economy struggling and 2012 looming, we&apos;re &quot;just&quot; $100 billion away from hitting the debt ceiling again, and President Obama wants the OK for another $1.2 trillion in debt, lifting the total to $16.394 trillion.

            <title>Is Army Islamizing The Military By Allowing Hijab?  12.27.11</title>
            <description>Political Correctness: First the Pentagon hosts the 9/11 imam. Then the Marines open a mosque at Quantico. Now the Army&apos;s letting JROTC cadets wear the hijab. What next?

In a letter to a Muslim group sent on Defense Secretary Leon Panetta&apos;s behalf, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army Larry Stubblefield said the Army will now let Muslims in the Junior Reserve Officers&apos; Training Corps wear the Islamic headscarf during training and parade formations.

&quot;Based on your concerns, the Army has reviewed its JROTC uniform policy and will develop appropriate procedures to provide cadets the opportunity to request the wear of religious head dress, such as the turban and hijab,&quot; Stubblefield wrote. &quot;The Army prides itself in being a diverse organization, comprised of individuals from many faiths and religions. We appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention.&quot;

            <description>Middle East: With Islamists winning 70% in a second round of parliamentary voting, Egypt is speeding toward a theocratic, anti-American dictatorship. The &quot;Arab Spring&quot; is turning into a long winter of despotism.

Serious long-term trouble is brewing in the Mideast. The continued rise of the Muslim Brotherhood&apos;s ridiculously named &quot;Freedom and Justice Party,&quot; as well as the Al-Nour Party of the radical Salafi movement, places in jeopardy the assassinated Anwar Sadat&apos;s three-decades-old peace settlement between historic adversaries Egypt and Israel.

Add a soon-to-be-nuclear Iran and a Syrian terror regime that refuses to be toppled by street demonstrators and the skies above these ancient lands look dark indeed.

            <description>Islamofascism: Scores of Christians attending Catholic mass in Nigerian churches were slaughtered in their pews by massive bomb blasts on Christmas Day. While decried as &quot;un-Islamic,&quot; a frightening number of Muslims believe the bombings are justified.

The year that began with a New Year&apos;s attack on an Egyptian Coptic Christian Church that killed 21 worshippers is ending with attacks on two Nigerian churches that killed 35 and injured at least 57.

While such attacks are officially condemned, they are part of a campaign of violence and suicide bombings for which 34% of Nigerian respondents in a Pew Global Attitudes Project poll last year expressed support.

            <title>Silent Night For Christians In Afghanistan And Iraq  12.23.11</title>
            <description>Religious Freedom: As our nation celebrates Christmas, Christians in the nations we shed blood and treasure for to establish democracy face extinction. For Christians in Iraq and Afghanistan, it may be the last Christmas ever.

Christianity faces the threat of actual extinction in Iraq and Afghanistan as a consequence of systematic, sustained and sometimes violent persecution, according to the chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.

According to USCIRF head Leonard Leo in an interview with CNSNews.com, the Iraqi government has not taken adequate steps to protect Christians or prosecute those who attack them. The precipitate U.S. withdrawal from Iraq and the return of sectarian violence may leave Iraqi Christians in the cross hairs of Iraqi extremists.

&quot;I&apos;m very, very concerned about what will happen after our presence is completely gone,&quot; Leo said, &quot;and I don&apos;t know how we continue to put pressure on the Iraqi government and on the security forces and others in Iraq to protect the Christians in the absence of any presence.&quot;

            <title>Are Our Nuclear Secrets Safe In Obama&apos;s Hands?  12.23.11</title>
            <description>Inviting Espionage: The administration is considering reviving a &apos;90s-era nuclear scientist exchange program with China. Does no one in the White House remember how much damage the previous arrangement caused?

Of the many regrettable initiatives dreamed up by the Clinton administration, few were as perverse as the nuclear scientist exchange program. The arrangement turned out to be a gift to the Chinese, who were able to steal U.S. nuclear secrets virtually in plain sight.

Either unable or unwilling to learn from the past, the Obama administration wants to bring the program back. The Washington Times reports that &quot;Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel B. Poneman is working on a major Obama administration initiative that would renew scientist exchanges between U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories and Chinese nuclear facilities.&quot;

The 1990s version of the exchanges yielded unprecedented espionage. How bad was it? An internal lab document obtained and reported by IBD in 1999 indicated that &quot;during the Clinton administration, the number of Chinese nationals working&quot; at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico had &quot;catapulted 411%.&quot;

We&apos;re not saying every Chinese worker at the lab was a spy. But Congress found at least 13 suspected spies gained lab access without proper CIA or FBI vetting. Why open U.S. labs to scientists from a nation that had already been stealing our nuclear secrets for decades?

Given the history, it&apos;s hard to understand why the Obama White House would return to such an obviously flawed plan. The reasons must be excessively complex, so nuanced that the average person couldn&apos;t possibly understand them.

As with much of life, the simplest explanation is usually the right one. In this case the simplest explanation is as follows: The Democrats have long been given over to Jimmy Carter-style diplomacy that naively assumes enemies or belligerent regimes can be neutralized or co-opted if they&apos;re treated as if they were friends.

            <title>As Argentina Seizes Newsprint, Press Freedom Suffers  12.23.11</title>
            <description>Press Freedom: What&apos;s the oldest trick in the dictator&apos;s handbook? Why, to seize the newsprint. Fresh from a big electoral win, Argentina&apos;s President Cristina Fernandez has pulled that hoary stunt, topping even Hugo Chavez.

By a vote of 41-26, Argentina&apos;s Senate passed a law to nationalize all newsprint, of course in &quot;the national interest.&quot;

In Argentina, a nation that still avidly reads newspapers and magazines, that&apos;s a lot of power. It effectively hands the government a monopoly on newsprint — since only one newsprint plant, Papel Prensa, remains.

By coincidence, it&apos;s owned by La Nacion and Clarin, two media groups Fernandez has pursued for years.

The Newsprint Bill represents &quot;progress toward a free press,&quot; the government oozed.

It &quot;will improve the quality of information and the plurality of opinions in Argentina,&quot; added Vice President Amadou Boudou.

Baloney. It&apos;s a blow to free speech that opens the door not just to self-censorship, which is already rampant in Argentina, but to ever-more fascistic state manipulation of the country&apos;s communities, businesses and industries, and violations of personal and property rights.

            <title>Pizza Money Now, Smaller Social Security Checks Later  12.22.11</title>
            <description>Politics: Browbeaten by the polls and a pro-Obama press, the House of Representatives Thursday caved in to the White House on the payroll tax &quot;cut.&quot; Result: cash for pizza now — and smaller Social Security checks later.

Dubbed &quot;a compromise&quot; in Congress, GOP House Speaker John Boehner and Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced an agreement to extend the year&apos;s payroll tax cut by another two months and continue hashing out an extension for another year.

&quot;Sen. Reid and I have reached an agreement that will ensure taxes do not increase for working families on Jan. 1 while ensuring that a complex new reporting burden is not unintentionally imposed on small business job creators,&quot; Boehner said, adding that &quot;a new bill will be approved by the House that reflects the bipartisan agreement in the Senate along with new language that allows job creators to process and withhold payroll taxation under the same accounting structure that is currently in place.&quot;

&quot;Mercury is a neurotoxin that is particularly harmful to children, and emissions of mercury and other air toxics have been linked to damage to developing nervous systems, respiratory illnesses and other diseases.&quot;

            <title>ObamaCar Sticker Shock: Taxpayers Taken For A Ride  12.22.11</title>
            <description>Green Policy: A think tank crunches the subsidy and bailout dollars and puts the true cost of Government Motors&apos; electric car at a cool quarter-million. And the few sold have been largely bought by the 1%.

At a time when Democrats are blaming the GOP for blocking a payroll tax cut deal that will add $40 in the average paycheck, they have no problem taking that worker&apos;s tax dollars to make and subsidize what we once called an electric Edsel bought by a precious few with an average income of $170,000.

&quot;Each Chevy Volt sold thus far may have as much as $250,000 in state and federal dollars in incentives behind it — a total of $3 billion altogether, according to an analysis by James Hohman, assistant director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center for Public Policy.

            <title>Canada: If No Keystone XL, We&apos;ll Sell Our Oil To... 12.21.11</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: Canada&apos;s prime minister restates that if there&apos;s no Keystone XL pipeline in the works, not to worry. Our northern ally will still be our friend as it sends its tar sands oil to Asian markets.

&apos;I am very serious about selling our oil off this continent, selling our energy products off to Asia. I think we have to do that,&quot; Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a Monday interview with Canada&apos;s CTV National News.

It was the latest warning from our impatient northern neighbor that has used its energy resources to advance job creation and growth and is amazed at the reluctance of the United States to do so or even to take advantage of an offer to import oil from an ally rather than less-than-friendly regimes abroad.

Harper&apos;s comments were released a day after the White House sent signals it might balk at completing the proposed Keystone XL pipeline to bring Canada&apos;s tar sands oil to American refineries if the administration is forced to make a decision in 60 days.

The administration says 60 days is not enough time to study the new route agreed to by TransCanada, the Canadian firm seeking to export even more energy to an energy-hungry America. Yet the State Department has been studying the matter for three years, and the proposed new route shouldn&apos;t require kicking the oil can into 2013.

            <title>Obama’s Media Flying Monkeys Get Their Marching Orders, Gear Up To Do Battle  12.21.11</title>
            <description>Journalism: Now the mainsteam media aren&apos;t even trying to conceal it. Witness the leading lights of the Beltway press who went to the White House Monday to get their political talking points. What are these people, anyway?

The relationship between Barack Obama and his media continues to burn with the same ardor as it has from the opening days of the 2008 campaign. The latest example is private sessions the White House has held with certain favorites not for the purpose of imparting news but for advising how to spin it.

&quot;An all-star list of progressive and liberal media folks came to the White House (Monday) to chat with President Obama over coffee in the Roosevelt Room,&quot; reported ABC&apos;s Jake Tapper — who wasn&apos;t invited.

&quot;The group chatted with the president about economic messaging, his agenda for 2012, the various campaign arguments against different GOP candidates, the desire among some Democrats for him to highlight his foreign policy accomplishments, fighting corporate influence, and the &apos;crappiness&apos; of the Senate filibuster.&quot;

            <itunes:summary>Journalism: Now the mainsteam media aren&apos;t even trying to conceal it. Witness the leading lights of the Beltway press who went to the White House Monday to get their political talking points. What are these people, anyway?

The relationship between Barack Obama and his media continues to burn with the same ardor as it has from the opening days of the 2008 campaign. The latest example is private sessions the White House has held with certain favorites not for the purpose of imparting news but for advising how to spin it.

&quot;An all-star list of progressive and liberal media folks came to the White House (Monday) to chat with President Obama over coffee in the Roosevelt Room,&quot; reported ABC&apos;s Jake Tapper — who wasn&apos;t invited.

&quot;The group chatted with the president about economic messaging, his agenda for 2012, the various campaign arguments against different GOP candidates, the desire among some Democrats for him to highlight his foreign policy accomplishments, fighting corporate influence, and the &apos;crappiness&apos; of the Senate filibuster.&quot;</itunes:summary>

            <title>Shining A Light on Crony Capitalism   12.21.11</title>
            <description>Rules: When Republicans suspended the 100-watt-light-bulb ban, they said they were trying to protect consumer choice. But they also managed to show how regulations help big business at the expense of the little guy.

The light-bulb ban was part of an energy bill pushed by Democrats in 2007 that set efficiency standards that traditional incandescent bulbs could never meet. The first to go was supposed to be the 100 watt bulb in 2012, followed by 75 watt bulbs the next year and the ubiquitous 60-watt bulb in 2014.

The argument is that forcing consumers to buy more efficient — and far more expensive — bulbs will greatly reduce energy consumption, and in turn, air pollution and global warming.

Earlier this month, Republicans suspended the law until October by denying funds for its implementation as part of a massive spending bill. For Democrats, this move was another sign of how out of touch the GOP is.

But look who else is complaining. As Politico reported, &quot;big companies like General Electric, Philips and Osram Sylvania (are) fuming.&quot; Allegedly these companies are mad because they invested lots of money getting ready for the new rules.

Fact is, they were pushing for the ban all along.

            <title>New Fed Rules On U.S. Banks Could Hurt Recovery   12.21.11</title>
            <description>Banks: The world&apos;s wealthiest countries are experiencing a financial crisis the likes of which haven&apos;t been seen in 80 years. So why does the Federal Reserve seem intent on ratcheting up the pain on U.S. banks?

With little fanfare from the general media, the Fed on Tuesday quietly announced it will force American banks to put aside more capital to cover their assets.

&quot;The recent financial crisis showed that some financial companies had grown so large, leveraged and interconnected that their failure could pose a threat to overall financial stability,&quot; the Fed said in its statement.

Sounds wise — prudent, even. And in the best of times this would be a good idea. But this isn&apos;t the best of times.

The economies of both Europe and the U.S. are fragile as eggshells, with growth in both areas shrinking or well below potential. In Europe, unemployment has shot up to dangerous levels, while the level of hidden unemployment in the U.S., according to our IBD/TIPP Poll, is above 19% — 30 million Americans.

            <description>National Security: Kim Jong Il&apos;s death exposed — once again — the alarming deficiencies of the spider web of U.S. intelligence agencies. We should know from 9/11 that what we don&apos;t know can kill us.

&apos;What use are they?&quot; Richard Nixon once asked regarding the Central Intelligence Agency, as recounted in Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tim Weiner&apos;s history of the CIA, &quot;Legacy of Ashes.&quot; &quot;They&apos;ve got 40,000 people over there reading newspapers.&quot;

Similarly, that hawk of hawks, onetime Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, liked to remind right-wing admirers of the CIA it was really &quot;the military arm of the State Department,&quot; whose feckless diplomats routinely appease U.S. enemies.

            <description>Politics: Lost in Beltway wrangling over a payroll tax cut, an ugly reality lurks: Our politicians are plotting yet another raid on the Social Security &quot;trust fund,&quot; which is already near insolvency. When will this madness stop?

President Obama and his congressional Democrats know well how bad their spendthrift reputation is among voters as election day approaches. With Obama at sub-50% approval numbers and Gallup reporting Congress clocking in at a record-low 11%, they expect a bloodbath at the polls in November — and maybe another slashed debt rating, too.

What then could be better for Democrats than to be able to claim that deep down, they&apos;re tax cutters, too? Just like Republicans — whose corporate tax cuts in 1982 led to an unparalleled decade of economic growth.

            <description>Jobs: President Obama tells anyone who&apos;ll listen that from dawn until dusk he&apos;s focused on job creation. Apparently, no one in his administration listens, since day after day they keep making job-killing decisions.

In fact, when it comes to jobs, Obama&apos;s policies are so bad that even his union pals are starting to notice.

The latest to take notice is the Communications Workers of America union. It reported last month that AT&amp;T&apos;s $39 billion bid for T-mobile would have brought 5,000 quality jobs back from overseas and created &quot;as many as 96,000 additional quality jobs in the build-out of high-speed wireless broadband.&quot;

            <title>New Brakes Won’t Stop Runaway EU Debtors   12.19.11</title>
            <description>Euro Crisis: The EU may impose new debt ceilings. There&apos;s just one problem: Every member save three is in violation. So it&apos;ll be like enforcing brakes on a runaway train — too little too late.

Under the latest deal to solve Europe&apos;s mushrooming debt crisis, member states have to submit their budgets to Brussels to certify that any deficit does not breach a ceiling of 0.5% of GDP. While that sounds good, only Estonia, Finland and Luxembourg can meet the new rule.

That means there would have to be some unspecified transition, or grace period, for most of the EU. Brussels is looking to Germany, the economically strongest member, to set the terms. But even Germany violated existing limits, which were far easier to meet.

That means there would have to be some unspecified transition, or grace period, for most of the EU. Brussels is looking to Germany, the economically strongest member, to set the terms. But even Germany violated existing limits, which were far easier to meet.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Vaclav Havel Crushed Communism By Speaking The Truth   12.19.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: Europe&apos;s outpouring of grief over the death of Vaclav Havel, hero of Czechoslovakia&apos;s great Velvet Revolution, says much about its longing for more like him. His honesty and courage liberated Europe.

Some 75,000 Czechs bearing roses and candles lined up in Wenceslas Square beginning Sunday, as they once did in 1989, to pay tribute to one of the greatest freedom fighters of the 20th century. Havel died Sunday at age 75 after liberating his country, leading his nation as president from 1989-2003, and voicing his moral authority to scourge lingering tyrants in Cuba, Burma and China.

Havel, a playwright whose health had been weakened by years spent in communist dungeons, was an unlikely and yet perfect leader for leading Eastern Europe&apos;s liberation from communism. He unshackled Europe with the only weapon in his arsenal — words, which he animated and empowered by expressing them truthfully.

            <title>Democrats&apos; Payroll Tax Cut Has Sell-By Date   12.19.11</title>
            <description>Taxation: Democrats are furious at a GOP revolt against their agreement to extend a middle-class payroll tax cut — for two whole months. Call it a &quot;parking meter&quot; tax cut.

Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush coasted to re-election as president in no small measure because both cut taxes across the board. Since then, Democrats have tried to adapt that successful formula to their class warfare ideology.

But even strings-attached tax cuts are so painful for these enablers of big government that what they propose always ends up, at the end of the day, not being a real tax cut at all.

            <title>Axis Of Evil Loses Murderous Dear Leader Kim Jong Il   12.19.11</title>
            <description>North Korea: Dear Leader is dead, preceded by millions sacrificed to his family&apos;s murderous reign. As he takes his place in hell, he is a reminder evil must be resisted, not appeased.

When President George W. Bush included North Korea in his &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; along with Iraq and Iran, he was greeted with snickers from those to whom evil is a foreign and unnecessarily provocative concept. Yet evil exists and will continue to be a threat even if its poster child, Kim Jong Il, is dead.

We once called him the Prince of Darkness, and the land he ruled was dark, both physically and literally. It is Rwanda with nukes. It was as if Sudan was enriching uranium while committing its genocide in Darfur. North Korea developed nukes and the missiles to carry them while its depraved leader drank imported cognac and his people literally ate the bark off trees.

            <title>Fannie, Freddie At Heart Of Financial Crisis, Fraud Charges Show   12.16.11</title>
            <description>Financial Crisis: The SEC is suing top officers at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for not disclosing their true exposure to subprime loans. Maybe now the left&apos;s tired canard that Fannie and Freddie were blameless can be laid to rest.

The left&apos;s preferred narrative of the financial meltdown goes something like this: Greedy banks, encouraged by reckless Bush-era deregulation and lusting after ever-higher profits regardless of the risk, caused the financial crisis.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage companies, were mere victims.

Well, the left has it exactly backward: It is a well-documented fact that government regulators twisted the arms of private banks to make subprime and other risky loans to people who couldn&apos;t pay them back.

And it imposed &quot;goals&quot; on Fannie and Freddie — with an implicit guarantee of taxpayer backing — to buy huge blocks of those loans and, ultimately, to resell them to gullible investors as mortgage-backed securities.

When the market fell apart, the banks were left with rotten loan portfolios, and Fannie and Freddie stuck the taxpayers with billions of dollars in losses.

            <title>There&apos;s No Reason To Ban Cellphone Use While Driving   12.16.11</title>
            <description>Prohibition: A federal agency is calling for a nationwide ban on all cellphone use while driving. Once again, Washington busybodies are exaggerating a problem because it happens to be a behavior they don&apos;t approve of.

Last Tuesday, the National Transportation Safety Board recommended that all cellphone use by drivers, including texting, be outlawed. The ban would include hands-free calls.

The NTSB&apos;s campaign comes a little more than a year after Obama administration Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said he didn&apos;t &quot;want people talking on phones&quot; while driving. LaHood even admitted that he was ready to back such a ban with federal legislation.

There are a few problems here.

First, regulating cellphone use is not a federal responsibility, even on federal roads. This is not an issue that Washington has the authority to address.

Second, there&apos;s no compelling reason for it. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says that 3,092 traffic deaths last year involved distracted drivers. But using a cell phone is only one of many driver distractions. Eating and drinking while behind the wheel are two others, and they are far more dangerous than yapping on a phone.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Aloofness Irks Democrats   12.16.11</title>
            <description>White House: President Obama complains a lot about &quot;partisan gridlock&quot; and &quot;obstruction&quot; in Congress. But even Democrats say he won&apos;t get down in the trenches to bridge differences.

Pouting over the collapse of his second spending stimulus (aka &quot;the jobs bill&quot;), Obama said, &quot;It would be nice if we could get a little bit of help from Capitol Hill.&quot;

He complained to a Colorado news station that he needs lawmakers to act &quot;if we&apos;re going to do big things.&quot;

But His Highness has only himself to blame.

Obama doesn&apos;t put in the effort past presidents have put in to get things done. He simply refuses to get his hands dirty, preferring to give lectures and leave the heavy lifting to others.

This is not an observation on the right. His aloofness is frustrating members of his own party and even staff.

&quot;Another former Obama staffer confided to me that it was clear to him that the president didn&apos;t mind giving speeches, but really avoided personal contact with members of Congress and folks outside the Beltway,&quot; noted Rep. Dennis Cardoza, D-Calif., in a Hill column this week.

            <title>Arpaio Unjustly In Justice Department Crosshairs   12.16.11</title>
            <description>Equity: The administration that refused to enforce voting rights law in the New Black Panther case is going after America&apos;s best-known sheriff for what it calls discriminatory policing practices involving Hispanics.

Coming soon after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Arizona&apos;s immigration and border enforcement law, the Justice Department&apos;s release of a scathing report Thursday accusing Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio of violating federal law and the Constitution in his department&apos;s handling of Hispanics smacks of retaliation.

With a thoroughness not seen in Justice&apos;s handling of the &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; federal gun-running debacle that resulted in the murder of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry a year ago, Assistant Attorney General Thomas E. Perez, head of the department&apos;s Civil Rights Division, listed Arpaio&apos;s alleged excesses and said a three-year civil investigation found that the sheriff and his deputies engaged in unconstitutional conduct and violations of federal law that jeopardized his &quot;commitment to fair and effective&quot; law enforcement.

            <title>&quot;Occupy&quot; A Media Creation Unworthy Of Time’s Person Of The Year   12.16.11</title>
            <description>Bias: So Time has decided its Thing of the Year is the Protester, a phony, media-fed phenomenon if there ever was one. Why didn&apos;t the magazine just hold a mirror up to itself?

Going all drooly in its 6,884-word confection of illogic for the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; story it liked most in 2012, Time decided to convolute that story with the so-called &quot;Arab Spring&quot; uprisings and, while it was at it, the futile protests in bankrupt Europe.

But it&apos;s all rubbish. Occupy Wall Street — the unkempt campout of the same old rent-a-radicals calling for redistribution of wealth — was largely a media-generated phenomenon whose significance ends there.

            <itunes:summary>Bias: So Time has decided its Thing of the Year is the Protester, a phony, media-fed phenomenon if there ever was one. Why didn&apos;t the magazine just hold a mirror up to itself?

Going all drooly in its 6,884-word confection of illogic for the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; story it liked most in 2012, Time decided to convolute that story with the so-called &quot;Arab Spring&quot; uprisings and, while it was at it, the futile protests in bankrupt Europe.

But it&apos;s all rubbish. Occupy Wall Street — the unkempt campout of the same old rent-a-radicals calling for redistribution of wealth — was largely a media-generated phenomenon whose significance ends there.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Islamists Ready To Pounce As U.S. Lowers Flag In Iraq    12.15.11</title>
            <description>Mideast: Our premature departure from Iraq tells the world that the U.S., as in Vietnam, can&apos;t finish big jobs. But far worse, it opens the door to a nuclear-armed, pan-Islamist empire led by Iran.

Why, as Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin reported Thursday, did Iraqi leaders opt out of the official end-of-war ceremony in Baghdad?

Well over 4,000 U.S. servicemen and women gave their lives to free Iraq from Saddam Hussein, and some 32,000 were wounded over nearly a decade of war.

            <title>Why Pay Teachers More For Poor Student Performance?    12.15.11</title>
            <description>Education: Does anyone poor-mouth their pay more than public school teachers? A new study finds that to the contrary, teachers make 50% more than comparable private workers. So what do taxpayers get for this premium?

The short answer is poor schools, falling test scores, high dropout-rates, foolish policies, a free ride for the academic bottom dwellers and a growing home-school movement fleeing the system.

In sum, a Big-Labor dominated system that serves itself — not the public.

            <description>Entitlements: Pity the poor Democrats. Here they were counting on scaring seniors about GOP plans to &quot;destroy&quot; Medicare when Rep. Paul Ryan teams up with a prominent Senate Democrat to offer a compromise reform.

From the White House on down, Democrats were wringing their hands this week about the bi-partisan Medicare reform plan offered up by Ryan and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.

Their plan would shift Medicare from an open-ended health benefit to one in which the government provides a set amount of money for insurance. Seniors could choose from a variety of private, approved plans, as well as the traditional government-run Medicare.

            <description>Military Spending: The head of the House Armed Services Committee says already enacted and looming defense cuts could cost the economy a million and a half jobs. It could cost the nation much more than that.

As we&apos;ve written, the upcoming mandated cuts in defense spending, on top of already enacted cuts,are real cuts, not cuts in the rate of growth.

They are deep cuts in the budget baseline that will impair military readiness and our ability to meet our commitments and respond to crises around the world.

            <title>Dems Prove They&apos;re Not Really For Payroll Tax Cut   12.14.11</title>
            <description>Fiscal Policy: President Obama tried to get Republicans to oppose a payroll tax extension, but Senate Democrats are the ones now fighting it. When liberals propose tax cuts, it&apos;s almost never on the level.

When a beleaguered President Obama appeared before Congress in September to propose yet another massive stimulus spending program, including a payroll tax-cut extension paired with a &quot;millionaire surtax,&quot; it was viewed as a shrewd political move Republicans were sure to oppose. So, why are his Senate Democrats now determined to kill payroll tax-cut legislation?

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been falling all over himself this week to get the House-passed payroll tax-cut extension onto the Senate floor, where the Democratic majority there was ready and waiting to vote it down. Thanks to Senate rules, Republican senators were able to save the measure, but Reid is threatening to hold a spending bill hostage and shut down much of the federal government.

Why is the payroll tax cut passed Tuesday by the House in Reid&apos;s words &quot;dead on arrival&quot;? Maybe because it features a provision that would produce lots of real jobs — not through discredited Keynesian spending methods but by letting the private sector get going on utilizing North America&apos;s unutilized oil resources.

            <title>U.S. Aid To Pakistan Endangered By Gov&apos;t Ties To Bombers   12.14.11</title>
            <description>War On Terror: The jig may finally be up for Pakistan. Our &quot;ally&quot; has been caught in another double cross. And for the first time, there&apos;s a real chance Congress could cut off its aid.

New U.S. intelligence reveals that most of the material used to make improvised explosive devices used against our troops in Afghanistan originates from two fertilizer factories inside Pakistan.

The Pakistani plants — owned by one of the country&apos;s largest companies, Pakarab — have been making more than 300,000 metric tons of ammonium nitrate a year since 2004. The chemical has been traced to more than 80% of the homemade bombs used in Afghanistan to kill American and other coalition soldiers.

This summer alone, U.S. troops detected or were hit by 5,088 IEDs — the most for any three months since the Afghan war began in 2001. Those bombs killed 63 troops and wounded more than 1,200.

The chemical has been trucked to bomb factories inside Pakistan under the protection of Pakistani military intelligence, which the Pentagon says is running a &quot;proxy war&quot; against the U.S. Or it&apos;s been smuggled across the Afghan border on trucks, motorcycles, bikes, even donkey carts with the help of Pakistani guards.

            <title>Documents Show Justice&apos;s Breuer Misled On &apos;Furious&apos;   12.14.11</title>
            <description>Ethics In Government: Attorney General Eric Holder insists &quot;nobody at the Justice Department has lied&quot; about the gun-running scandal Fast and Furious. That in itself is a lie, as his deputy&apos;s emails prove.

Documents obtained by congressional investigators show Lanny Breuer, Justice&apos;s criminal division chief, misled the public — under oath — about what he knew about the disastrous and ultimately deadly program. And what he did to cover it up.

• Lie No. 1: Breuer knew as far back as April 2010 that ATF officials had let assault weapons &quot;walk&quot; — which meant ending surveillance on guns suspected en route to Mexican warlords, and turning a blind eye to criminals illegally buying weapons for trafficking on the border.

Guns found at the scene of slain Border Patrol agent Brian Terry were traced to Fast and Furious.

That April, Breuer and an aide conspired with ATF leaders to cover up &quot;the bad stuff that would come out.&quot;

When Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, got wind of the scandal, he demanded answers. Breuer consulted in the drafting of a Feb. 4 letter to Grassley falsely denying that ATF had ever walked guns.

            <title>Spending Cap Plan Gives California Real Choice in &apos;12   12.14.11</title>
            <description>State Spending: A wave of tax-hike initiatives is making its way to the November 2012 ballot in California. But another proposal — to control government growth — could end up trumping them all.

Once the cradle of the tax revolt, California has long since devolved into a progressive policy lab and a public-worker&apos;s paradise. But you never know what may happen next.

The California electorate doesn&apos;t always follow the party line. Tax increases especially can be a tough sell, and the sheer number of similar tax-increase proposals headed for next year&apos;s general election ballot could backfire by confusing voters.

So far, there are three look-alike tax initiatives — including one pushed by Gov. Jerry Brown — aimed mainly at funding schools. Progressive commentator Harold Meyerson, writing in the Los Angeles Times, calls this a recipe for &quot;mutually assured destruction.&quot;

Unlike Meyerson, we wouldn&apos;t want to discourage the governor or anyone else from making a pitch to the public. In fact, the more the tax-hike theme dominates the ballot, the better. That would just make another, much different initiative look all the more refreshing.

This is the Government Spending Limit Act of 2012. With backing from the well-funded California Taxpayers Association, it has a clear path to the ballot. Once there, it offers Californians a true alternative to all those other propositions that just ask for more money.

            <itunes:summary>State Spending: A wave of tax-hike initiatives is making its way to the November 2012 ballot in California. But another proposal — to control government growth — could end up trumping them all.

Once the cradle of the tax revolt, California has long since devolved into a progressive policy lab and a public-worker&apos;s paradise. But you never know what may happen next.

The California electorate doesn&apos;t always follow the party line. Tax increases especially can be a tough sell, and the sheer number of similar tax-increase proposals headed for next year&apos;s general election ballot could backfire by confusing voters.

So far, there are three look-alike tax initiatives — including one pushed by Gov. Jerry Brown — aimed mainly at funding schools. Progressive commentator Harold Meyerson, writing in the Los Angeles Times, calls this a recipe for &quot;mutually assured destruction.&quot;

Unlike Meyerson, we wouldn&apos;t want to discourage the governor or anyone else from making a pitch to the public. In fact, the more the tax-hike theme dominates the ballot, the better. That would just make another, much different initiative look all the more refreshing.

This is the Government Spending Limit Act of 2012. With backing from the well-funded California Taxpayers Association, it has a clear path to the ballot. Once there, it offers Californians a true alternative to all those other propositions that just ask for more money.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Do Politics And Bad TV Mix? Absolutely   12.13.11</title>
            <description>Culture: When surfing 500 TV channels and nothing&apos;s on, do your politics determine which program may be worth some prime-time time-wasting? Say, &quot;Swamp Loggers&quot;?

Entertainment Weekly thinks so. Rather, Experian-Simmons, the more scientific-sounding consumer researchers retained by EW, reports your political alter ego may be holding, perhaps even monopolizing, your remote.

Moreover, if you&apos;re Republican you favor the former (usually found on a high channel, not to be prejudicial) over the latter (which aims lower), favored by Democrats.

            <title>Jet Fuel-Gate Is Obama&apos;s New Solyndra   12.13.11</title>
            <description>Ecofanaticism: SolyndraGate was no isolated case of corrupt government misspending. The U.S. Navy was just forced to buy 450,000 gallons of biofuels from an Obama-connected firm at an outrageous $16 per gallon.

The massive Obama stimulus was supposed to generate millions of jobs, but the $535 million loan guarantee it gave to solar panel maker Solyndra on the eve of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy illustrated the fundamental incompetence of Obama&apos;s neo-Keynesian economic ideology.

Now we find the Navy partnering with the Agriculture Department to purchase hundreds of thousands of gallons of alternative biofuel in place of standard JP-5 fuel for Navy aircraft — the biggest federal purchase of biofuel ever.

            <title>Will The Supreme Court Seal Our Nation&apos;s Borders?   12.13.11</title>
            <description>Border Justice: As the administration proposes unmanned border entry and halving our National Guard force on the border, the Supreme Court agrees to tackle Arizona&apos;s tough immigration law in an election year.

Arizona wasn&apos;t around when the original 13 states formed the federal government knowing there were certain things it could do best, such as the constitutional mandate to provide for the common defense and protect our borders.

National and border security involves not only deterring foreign armies armed with tanks, but also protecting our borders from an invasion involving ladders and pickup trucks. That, Arizona argued when it passed SB1070, the feds have woefully failed to do. So Arizona cloned federal law and said we&apos;ll do it ourselves.

            <title>Americans&apos; Fear Of Big Government Has Risen Under Obama   12.13.11</title>
            <description>Politics: The percentage of Americans who fear big government is close to an all-time high. It&apos;s no coincidence that in recent history this alarm has tended to peak toward the end of Democratic terms in the White House.

According to a new Gallup poll, &quot;Americans&apos; concerns about the threat of big government continue to dwarf those about big business and big labor, and by an even larger margin now than in March 2009.&quot; Through telephone surveys conducted Nov. 28 through Dec. 1, Gallup found that 64% of Americans say big government will be the biggest threat to the country, while only 26% believe the same thing about big business.

The mark, coming less than three years into President Obama&apos;s term, is the highest since 1999 and 2000, when 65% named big government the greatest threat. Is it a mere coincidence that the historical high came at the end of a Democrat&apos;s eight years in the White House?

            <description>Election 2012: In the latest GOP debate, Newt Gingrich caused a scandal by defending his remark that the Palestinians were an &quot;invented people.&quot; The real scandal is it took this long for an American politician to tell the truth.

Saturday&apos;s debate showed why Newt Gingrich has catapulted to the top of the polls. Flawed though he is — and as all humans are — he has a depth of historical knowledge and intellectual fearlessness that people find appealing.

Case in point: an exchange between Gingrich and ABC&apos;s George Stephanopoulos and the other candidates that will go down as one of the most one-sided — and devastating — in recent presidential debate history.

In his &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview this weekend, Obama claimed the economy is suffering &quot;structural problems that have been building up for two decades.&quot;

Let&apos;s see, in the past 20 years we&apos;ve had three previous presidents, one of whom was two-term Democrat Bill Clinton.

            <description>Global Warming: So an accord has been reached at the Durban climate conference after all. Or did envoys merely agree to make a real deal later, letting them continue with their corrupt enterprise?

The headlines say the representatives at the United Nations climate conference in South Africa reached an agreement. But the real story is that the meeting only produced an agreement to start more talks on a deal to replace the Kyoto Protocol by 2015 with emissions limits that won&apos;t be in effect until 2020.

Despite the uncertainty of such a proposition, one official, Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, South Africa&apos;s foreign minister, nevertheless had the nerve to claim &quot;We have saved planet Earth for the future of our children and our great-grandchildren.&quot;

            <description>Energy: After admitting there&apos;s no documented evidence of groundwater contamination due to a technique used to extract oil and gas from shale, the EPA tries to manufacture a crisis in Wyoming.

At a House Oversight Committee hearing in May, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson confirmed that, despite fears that hydraulic fracturing, commonly referred to as &quot;fracking,&quot; would lead to contamination of ground water, there was no independently documented instances that it had occurred.

Jackson told the committee: &quot;I&apos;m not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself has affected water.&quot;

Claiming its aim is to &quot;end corporate profits&quot; Occupy&apos;s leadership, consulting no one, has declared war on the U.S. economy by trying to disrupt major ports in Portland, Ore., and Oakland, Long Beach and San Diego, Calif.

Before the cops kicked them out and arrested a few, they managed to put a grimy paw around the neck of a the U.S. economy, aiming to strangle it all.

            <itunes:summary>Economic Illiteracy: Is the discredited &quot;Occupy&quot; protest horde shifting to economic terrorism? Its attempt to shut down West Coast ports Monday — in the name of &quot;good jobs&quot; — is a nasty shot at America&apos;s workers.

Claiming its aim is to &quot;end corporate profits&quot; Occupy&apos;s leadership, consulting no one, has declared war on the U.S. economy by trying to disrupt major ports in Portland, Ore., and Oakland, Long Beach and San Diego, Calif.

Before the cops kicked them out and arrested a few, they managed to put a grimy paw around the neck of a the U.S. economy, aiming to strangle it all.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Too Much Regulation Is Damaging Economy, Killing Jobs    12.8.11</title>
            <description>Red Tape: Seeing it&apos;s vulnerable on the issue of job-killing regulation, the White House is pushing back with media spin and misleading studies. Unfortunately, some conservatives have taken the bait.

Columnist David Brooks, for one, claims &quot;it&apos;s not clear that regulations are a major contributor to the current period of slow growth,&quot; adding &quot;Obama has not increased regulatory costs more than Reagan and the Bushes.&quot;

Never mind that Obama in just his first two years racked up $40 billion in new costs, almost matching the prior eight-year total.

Guzzling more Kool-Aid, Brooks maintained the Obama White House &quot;does rigorous cost-benefit analyses to review proposed regulations and minimize their economic harm.&quot; His proof? Obama&apos;s regulatory czar Cass Sunstein &quot;is incredibly wonky&quot; and no ideologue.

Uh huh. This is the same Sunstein who wrote a book proposing a &quot;Second Bill of Rights,&quot; including guaranteed homeownership and health care for all.

Yeah, he&apos;ll work real hard to rein in ObamaCare.

            <title>Dud In Durban: Climate Conference Ends Without A Deal   12.8.11</title>
            <description>Climate: Nearly 200 countries sent representatives to the climate change talks in Durban, South Africa. But it was merely posturing. Few were willing to sign on to an agreement that will wreck their economies.

Talks were wrapping up Friday with no deal in place. The representatives simply could not agree on a climate pact even after what the Times of India called &quot;grueling endless negotiations.&quot; There will be no Durban Mandate that would put binding restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions.

The developed nations typically make a lot of noise about cutting greenhouse gas emissions ahead of these United Nations climate conferences. It&apos;s part of the script.

Even national leaders who harbor some doubt join the chorus. They&apos;d rather play the game than be labeled as backward, anti-science deniers by the media, left-wing politicians and special interests.

President Bush refused to go along in 2001 and was summarily smeared by the London Guardian, which said he had performed a &quot;Taliban-like act&quot; in his &quot;decision to trash the Kyoto global warming treaty.&quot;

            <title>Obama Blocks The Biggest Shovel-Ready Project Ever    12.8.11</title>
            <description>Jobs: The president says that extending unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut will create more jobs than an oil pipeline from Canada. There are at least 20,000 members of the 99% who would disagree.

You can see why the economy is in trouble. Vice President Joe Biden, the stimulus sheriff, says he turned first to MF Global&apos;s Jon Corzine for economic advice and President Obama thinks 20,000 people getting extended unemployment benefits does more for the economy than 20,000 people getting paychecks to build the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada.

In the president&apos;s view, extending the payroll tax cuts is more important than adding more people to the payrolls, unless they are making electric cars that catch fire or work for solar-panel makers that go bankrupt.

Any attempt to link the pipeline to a payroll tax cut extension will be vetoed, Obama said Wednesday as he stood next to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

President Obama has dropped any pretense that delaying the pipeline that would bring Canadian tar-sands oil to American refineries is really related to environmental safety concerns.

            <title>Britain&apos;s EU Veto: Well Done   12.8.11</title>
            <description>Europe: The first exercise of an EU veto vindicates Margaret Thatcher&apos;s prophetic warning: Europe must not &quot;suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the center of a European conglomerate.&quot;

Britain&apos;s Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron earned much praise from Thatcherite House of Commons members when he, after an all-night session in Brussels, announced that his government would veto the ramming through of a new European Union treaty addressing Europe&apos;s expanding financial crisis.

The &quot;treaty reform&quot; demanded by French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his fellow continental leaders amounts to more bailouts and taxes. This devil&apos;s pact proposes a $666 billion European Stability Mechanism to add new handouts to Greece, Ireland and Portugal, then hope there&apos;s enough booty left if Italy or Spain goes under.

Good luck getting countries that have managed their economies responsibly to help finance such an international dole program — one that clearly won&apos;t permanently solve Europe&apos;s extended financial crisis.

            <description>Industrial Policy: Just like the cars themselves, it looks like President Obama&apos;s vision of an electric car future won&apos;t get very far. In fact, the failure of his $5 billion bet is so glaring, even the mainstream press is noticing.

In a lengthy report on the Obama administration&apos;s maniacal electric-car push, the Washington Post discovered that &quot;taxpayers in many cases will not see a return on their money soon, if ever.&quot;

As the Post notes, Obama promised that his budgeting for electric cars would create thousands of jobs. So he threw $2.4 billion in loans to car companies, another $2.4 billion in grants to battery makers, and is handing out $7,500 in tax credits to anyone who buys one of these cars.

&quot;But in recent months,&quot; the Post found, &quot;production lines and sales expectations have been dramatically scaled back.&quot;

            <title>America Should Side With Russian People Against Putin   12.8.11</title>
            <description>Liberty: Russians have unexpectedly taken to the streets to obstruct Vladimir Putin&apos;s heavy-handed return to the presidency. Will the promise of the Soviet Union&apos;s demise be fulfilled two decades later?

Opponents of ex-KGB thug Vladimir Putin got a boost when Mikhail Gorbachev took their side. After Sunday&apos;s questionable parliamentary vote, giving Putin&apos;s United Russia party less than a majority, the last of the Soviet premiers told Interfax:

&quot;More and more people are starting to believe that the election results are not fair.&quot; He also warned that &quot;ignoring public opinion discredits the authorities and destabilizes the situation.&quot;

We have more than once debunked the myths surrounding Gorbachev. The late Boris Yeltsin, who famously stood on a Red Army tank in Moscow to defy a hard-line coup attempt in 1991, was the real post-Soviet hero; Gorbachev only wanted to soften communism.

            <title>A Plot To Undermine The Right To Bear Arms   12.8.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: Newly obtained documents show that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives discussed using its covert operation Fast and Furious to argue for new rules about gun sales. We told you so.

As we observed in June, the way Fast and Furious — the government&apos;s gun-running operation that resulted in the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry — was conducted made no sense unless its intent was to facilitate violence with U.S. weapons in the interests of pursuing the administration&apos;s gun-control agenda.

Now documents obtained by CBS News confirm that our first suspicions were correct.

As CBS&apos; Sharyl Attkisson reports, emails show ATF officials discussed using the deliberate transfer of weapons to Mexican drug cartels to justify a new gun regulation known as &quot;Demand Letter 3.&quot;

We say deliberate because congressional testimony by ATF agents demonstrates how the tracking of Fast and Furious weapons stopped at the border and that requests to interdict the weapons transfers and arrest the gun traffickers were denied by higher-ups.

            <description>Jurisprudence: The 9th Circuit has a richly deserved reputation for being the most overturned appeals court in the country. But recently it made a sensible ruling, one that could save some lives.

Under the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, it&apos;s illegal in this land of the free for someone to sell his or her organs in a futures market — or in any other market. While organ donations are considered noble, the selling and buying of organs is treated as a criminal enterprise that can result in a hard stretch in prison.

That barrier might be cracking, however, thanks to a decision by an appeals court known for its history of foolish rulings. And the biggest beneficiaries won&apos;t be the sellers who get paid, but the thousands who would otherwise die if they don&apos;t get transplants.

On Dec. 1, a panel of three judges from the 9th Circuit ruled that some bone marrow donors can be paid. The decision was based on a technology that turns specialized cells in the blood, which as a renewable tissue can be legally sold, into marrow.

Until this technology was available, marrow had to be extracted from the bone and the process was treated like any other organ donation: The marrow could be given away but not sold.

            <title>Five Big Lies in Obama&apos;s Economic Fairness Speech   12.7.11</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: One thing is certainly true about President Obama — no matter how many times people point out the falsehoods in his speeches, he just keeps making them. Case in point: his latest &quot;economic fairness&quot; address.

In that speech Tuesday, Obama once again tried to build a case for his liberal, big-spending, tax-hiking, regulatory agenda. But as with so many of his past appeals, Obama&apos;s argument rests on a pile of untruths. Among the most glaring:

• Tax cuts and deregulation have &quot;never worked&quot; to grow the economy. There&apos;s so much evidence to disprove this claim, it&apos;s hard to know where to start. But let&apos;s begin with the fact that countries with greater economic freedom — lower taxes, less government, sound money, free trade — consistently produce greater overall prosperity.

Here at home, President Reagan&apos;s program of lower taxes and deregulation led to an historic two-decade economic boom. Plus, states with lower taxes and less regulation do better than those that follow Obama&apos;s prescription.

            <title>Why Does Pedophilia In Hollywood Get A Free Pass?    12.7.11</title>
            <description>Child Abuse: Recent charges and past history point to a pedophilia problem in the film industry, yet we rarely hear about it. Why is that, and why doesn&apos;t the congressman who represents Hollywood look into it?

It&apos;s remarkable how little attention the press and politicians have given abuse of children in the film industry — especially in view of the coverage devoted to scandals in the Catholic Church. But recent events suggest lots of trouble under the surface.

On Monday, Fox News reported that Martin Weiss, a manager of child actors, has been charged with sexually abusing a child younger than 12. Weiss told his young victim that what they were doing was &quot;common practice in the entertainment industry,&quot; authorities said.

Two weeks earlier, a &quot;Sesame Street&quot; musical composer, Fernando Rivas, was arraigned on charges of coercing a child &quot;to engage in sexually explicit conduct.&quot; He was also charged with production and distribution of child pornography.

Then there was Jason James Murphy, who worked as a Hollywood casting agent for years before his record of kidnapping and sexually abusing a boy was exposed in the Los Angeles Times Nov. 17. Penalty-free, he found roles for kids in such family fare as &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; and &quot;The Three Stooges.&quot;

            <title>Eric Holder&apos;s New Scandal: Money Laundering For Cartels   12.7.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: The House committee probing government gun-running now sets it sights on possible money-laundering involving drug cartel funds run in the name of drug enforcement. Why should we believe DOJ this time?

It&apos;s an old adage that when investigating criminal activity you should follow the money. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has announced an investigation into a money-laundering operation allegedly run by the Drug Enforcement Administration. We may need to follow the people following the money.

Just as Fast and Furious was allegedly intended to track and interdict gun-trafficking into Mexico, this operation, detailed in a New York Times article Sunday, is said to have as its purpose to follow how criminal organizations move their money, where they keep their assets and, most important, who their leaders are.

But the question once again arises: Have the feds interrupted or aided the flow?

After a Friday document dump showing how deliberately deceptive the Department of Justice and Attorney General Eric Holder were regarding Operation Fast and Furious, the government&apos;s gun-running operation that led to the death of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, it&apos;s hard to believe this latest scheme was well-run.

            <title>America Is Close To Falling In The Debt Pit    12.7.11</title>
            <description>Euro Crisis: That giant sucking sound is the globalization of debt, and America&apos;s slowly being pulled into the abyss. If we don&apos;t want to become the next Italy, we must first get our own house in order.

The German press is reporting that the Federal Reserve may float loans to the International Monetary Fund to help bail out Greece and other euro zone welfare states on the verge of collapse.

Greece is seeing a dangerous run on its banks. Many Greeks are emptying their savings accounts and hoarding their savings in their homes because they fear the banking system will collapse.

By withdrawing funds, they are forcing banks to scale back on lending, which is only making the recession there worse. The jobless rate in Greece recently shot up to 18%.

So now the idea is to set up a special IMF fund to backstop the euro zone bailout fund in case debt-ridden Spain and Italy fall the way of Greece. The total fund could top $134 billion.

            <description>Campaign &apos;12: Two leading presidential candidates wrap themselves in the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt. TR was in some ways a decent leader, but the example of America&apos;s first progressive president isn&apos;t one to follow today.

In recent days, both GOP hopeful Newt Gingrich and President Obama have cited the same man as someone to emulate: Theodore Roosevelt.

While most Americans know Roosevelt for his hypermasculine, hard-charging leadership style, he was in fact a progressive — and, indeed, ran for president in 1912 on the Progressive Party ticket.

            <description>Election &apos;12: President Obama this week started testing his new campaign theme, replacing &quot;hope and change&quot; with the equally vacant promise of &quot;fairness.&quot; Apparently he hopes Americans can be fooled twice.

In a talk Tuesday at the site of Teddy Roosevelt&apos;s &quot;New Nationalism&quot; speech, Obama repeatedly invoked the notion of fairness. &quot;We are greater together,&quot; he said, &quot;when everyone engages in fair play, everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share.&quot;

The problem is that fairness, just like hope and change, can mean anything anyone wants it to.

Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whose legislative excesses helped spawn the Tea Party movement that made her the ex-speaker, has fired a shot across the bow of former Speaker Newt Gingrich: Win the GOP nomination for president and I will unpack your baggage in public.

Except that she can&apos;t and she should know it.

            <description>Iran: Want to thwart the Islamic Revolution and its nuclear ambitions? Cut off its exports of crude. Prices may spike, but with the right moves from the U.S., maybe not for long.

The big problem with petro-states is that the world needs what they sell. And Iran remains an important source of crude oil despite sanctions that have slowed the development of its vast reserves.

Based on 2010 data, it ships about 2.6 million barrels a day, or about 3% of the world&apos;s total crude oil consumption. The global oil market has very little surplus, so pulling that amount of crude would have a sharp effect on prices.

            <title>&apos;Arab Spring&apos; Brings Islamist Radicals To Power     12.5.11</title>
            <description>Foreign Policy: The universally celebrated &quot;Arab Spring&quot; is harvesting a bumper crop of Islamist regimes so radical we&apos;ll soon miss Egypt&apos;s Hosni Mubarak and even Libya&apos;s Moammar Gadhafi.

Like Tunisia, Egypt just voted in the previously outlawed Islamist party, while al-Qaida&apos;s flag flies over Libya. The new regimes want to wipe Israel off the map, and they hate the U.S. just as much. These are the fruits of the &quot;democracy in the Middle East&quot; that President Obama and the left facilitated in one of the worst foreign-policy blunders in history.

When tens of thousands of Muslims rioted in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square last January, the White House and media spoke breathlessly of Western-style freedom blooming across the Arab desert.

            <description>Democracy: Russia&apos;s voters stunned the Kremlin on Sunday, booting a large part of the parliamentary majority of Vladimir Putin&apos;s ruling United Russia party. Is the famous patience of Russia&apos;s people finally running out?

For years, the biggest riddle wrapped in Russia&apos;s mystery was how its citizens could vote for the likes of Vladimir Putin and his Peronist-style corporate state fascism and nationalism.

Oh, Russia&apos;s people are famously patient, as Stalin noted. It&apos;s also true that Russia has had an oil boom since about 2002, drawing high foreign investment.

            <title>Whoever&apos;s Behind Sabotage, Attacks In Iran: Keep It Up   12.5.11</title>
            <description>Proper Response: Iran&apos;s military bases are blowing up and its nuclear scientists are dying early. Who&apos;s responsible? Hard to tell. But it appears someone recognizes that Tehran is at war with civilization and is fighting back.

In the last two years, there have been more than two dozen mysterious explosions at Iranian military facilities, including one last week that the New York Times characterized as a &quot;major setback for Iran&apos;s most advanced long-range missile program.&quot;

Many of Iran&apos;s nuclear scientists have also been terminated under similarly peculiar circumstances. They&apos;ve been &quot;assassinated&quot; by masked motorcycle riders who attach magnetic bombs to their cars, common car bombs, radioactive poisoning and other clandestine-looking attacks. There have also been a few &quot;accidental&quot; deaths among the scientists.

            <title>Justice Dept. Caught In Lie About &apos;Fast And Furious&apos;   12.5.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: The Justice Department has formally withdrawn a letter to Congress denying it sanctioned or allowed guns to be transferred to Mexico because it contained &quot;inaccuracies.&quot; That&apos;s one way of putting it.

Back in February, Assistant Attorney General Ron Welch, in response to the investigations by Rep. Darrell Issa and Sen. Chuck Grassley of the Fast and Furious gun &quot;walking&quot; program run out of ATF&apos;s Phoenix office, wrote a letter stating that the &quot;allegation that ATF &apos;sanctioned&apos; or otherwise knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons is false.&quot;

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Welch contended, &quot;makes every effort to interdict weapons that have been purchased illegally and prevent their transportation to Mexico.&quot; Another Friday document dump has confirmed what agent testimony and other information have already shown — this letter, and almost everything in it, was a complete fabrication.

            <description>Election &apos;12: Herman Cain&apos;s withdrawal concludes a media hit job that sends out two chilling warnings. To conservative businessmen: Don&apos;t dare run for high office. To black candidates: Don&apos;t stray off the liberal plantation.

There&apos;s no denying that Cain, who on Saturday succumbed to weeks of media-driven pressure and suspended his campaign, was an imperfect presidential candidate.

Beyond the series of far-from-proven allegations of sexual improprieties, his performance in answering foreign policy questions disappointed even his staunchest supporters.

            <title>USPS&apos; Cost-Cutting Plan Shows Need for Privatization   12.5.11</title>
            <description>Mail: The Postal Service has announced how it plans to fight increased competition for First Class mail — by providing worse service. If the USPS doesn&apos;t want to deliver the mail, Congress should let others give it a try.

On Monday, the Postal Service said it will shut almost half its mail processing centers and largely eliminate next-day delivery for first-class mail. That&apos;s on top of a 1-cent postage stamp hike that goes into effect next month.

It&apos;s all part of an effort to cut $20 billion in annual costs, staunch the flood of red ink and avoid bankruptcy. Still, it&apos;s hard to see how charging more for worse service is a credible plan for success.

            <title>Unemployment Decline To 8.6%: A Statistical Fluke?   12.2.11</title>
            <description>Jobs: Americans woke up Friday to the good news that the unemployment rate had dropped sharply from 9% to 8.6%. On closer inspection, the decline is highly questionable — and doesn&apos;t warrant a surge in optimism.

The White House hailed the news as &quot;further evidence that the economy is continuing to health&quot; and proving the $447 billion stimulus proposal &quot;is the right medicine&quot; for what ails us. Some in the media likewise saw good news, with headlines such as the Boston Globe&apos;s &quot;Unemployment Drops To Lowest Since 2009.&quot;

We&apos;re not trying to be Grinches, but the decline in the unemployment rate is highly suspect for many reasons.

The number is derived from a huge survey of 60,000 households the government takes each month. In November, the survey showed the labor force shrank by 315,000. That shrinkage makes the unemployment rate look a lot better than it is.

This is questionable because in the previous three months, the labor force increased by 323,000 workers on average. Statistically, a one-month reversal in the size of the workforce of more than 600,000 people just doesn&apos;t make sense — unless an awful lot of people threw up their hands in disgust and quit looking.

            <title>McDonald&apos;s Sidesteps The Happy Meal Prohibition   12.2.11</title>
            <description>Absurd Laws: The nannies of San Francisco tried to take the fun out of McDonald&apos;s Happy Meal. But enterprising managers found a way to bring joy to the kids anyway.

A city ordinance that prohibits fast-food restaurants from giving away toys with children&apos;s meals went into effect Thursday. San Francisco — of course — was the first big city in the country to pass such a law.

The intent, according to the supervisor who sponsored the prohibition, was to increase awareness of the nutritional makeup of children&apos;s meals.

That&apos;s Eric Mar&apos;s story and it seems he&apos;s sticking with it. But whatever the intent, McDonald&apos;s restaurants in San Francisco found a way around the government overreach. They&apos;re simply charging a minimal price — 10 cents — for adding a toy to the order.

So Happy Meals remain ... happy.

This should be a lesson for policymakers everywhere: People will always find a way to sidestep frivolous and vindictive laws and regulations.

Try as they might, the government nannies can&apos;t legislate away inoffensive activities, such as choosing a meal. Most folks will comply with laws that are intended to prevent harm to others.

            <itunes:summary>Absurd Laws: The nannies of San Francisco tried to take the fun out of McDonald&apos;s Happy Meal. But enterprising managers found a way to bring joy to the kids anyway.

A city ordinance that prohibits fast-food restaurants from giving away toys with children&apos;s meals went into effect Thursday. San Francisco — of course — was the first big city in the country to pass such a law.

The intent, according to the supervisor who sponsored the prohibition, was to increase awareness of the nutritional makeup of children&apos;s meals.

That&apos;s Eric Mar&apos;s story and it seems he&apos;s sticking with it. But whatever the intent, McDonald&apos;s restaurants in San Francisco found a way around the government overreach. They&apos;re simply charging a minimal price — 10 cents — for adding a toy to the order.

So Happy Meals remain ... happy.

This should be a lesson for policymakers everywhere: People will always find a way to sidestep frivolous and vindictive laws and regulations.

Try as they might, the government nannies can&apos;t legislate away inoffensive activities, such as choosing a meal. Most folks will comply with laws that are intended to prevent harm to others.</itunes:summary>

            <title>George Bush&apos;s Africa AIDS Achievement Big But Ignored    12.2.11</title>
            <description>World Health: At a star-studded gala Thursday, President Obama drew big praise from AIDS activists and NGOs for expanding AIDS-fighting programs. But the real accomplishment rests with his predecessor, President Bush.

After quietly helping to save 30 million lives from the scourge of AIDS across the African continent, it would seem that higher honors would be in store for Bush, whose AIDS initiatives there have been an astonishing success.

Obama, to his credit, acknowledged Bush in his World AIDS Day speech Thursday, as have serious-minded Africa advocates including rock singer Bono.

But among the garden-variety NGOs, media elites or activist groups, Bush gets little credit. While President Bush was in Zambia to begin a new effort to save lives on a women&apos;s anti-cancer initiative, the increasingly unhinged Amnesty International was busy screeching for Bush&apos;s arrest over there for his supposed &quot;war crimes.&quot;

The fact remains that Bush saved millions of lives, not just the 50 million Muslims he brought freedom to, but the 30 million Africans he helped to save from AIDS.

            <title>Former Union Chief Andy Stern Praises Crony Communism  12.2.11</title>
            <description>Economic Systems: The former head of the Service Employees International Union says capitalism is on the ash heap of history and sees China as our role model. We have seen his future, however, and it doesn&apos;t work.

President Obama once reportedly told aides, according to the New York Times, that things would be easier if he were president of China. Presumably he meant there would be no pesky things like a Congress, free elections and a free press to deal with.

Former SEIU chief Andy Stern, who may still hold the record for visits to the White House under this administration, would agree with that assessment. Stern, in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, writes of China&apos;s &quot;superior economic model,&quot; a command-and-control economy unimpeded by such anachronisms as democracy and a truly free market. Stern writes that the &quot;conservative-preferred free-market fundamentalist shareholder-only model&quot; of capitalism &quot;is being thrown onto the trash heap of history in the 21st century.&quot;

We should, he says, &quot;rethink&quot; our economic model rather than &quot;double down on an empirically failing free-market extremism.&quot; He speaks glowingly of China&apos;s 12th five-year plan and &quot;Deng Xiaoping&apos;s government-led growth-oriented reforms (that) have created the planet&apos;s second-largest economy&quot; soon to replace us as No. 1.

            <title>With Islamists Rising, Will Egypt Go The Way Of Iran?  12.1.11</title>
            <description>Islamism: The news from Cairo is bad. Early election returns point to a Parliament dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and the even more extreme Salafis. It&apos;s time for a fast reset to realism.

History never repeats itself precisely, but Egypt&apos;s revolution does seem to be falling into a familiar rut. Liberals lead the charge, overthrow the autocrats and then fall to a new breed of oppressors, more brutal, fanatical and globally ambitious than anything that went before.

Think France in 1789, Russia in 1917 and Iran in 1979.

            <title>Obama Campaigns For Re-Election On Public Dime  12.1.11</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: President Obama jammed traffic in Manhattan on Tuesday. State business? No, he was raising campaign funds. It&apos;s just the latest example of his questionable strategy of running for re-election by taking from the public.

And no, the public was not invited. Three stops the president made were strictly for fat-cat donors who paid as much as $36,000 a plate for the privilege, while reporters weren&apos;t even permitted to cover the protests outside the hotels.

But the trip was hardly just between Obama and his donors. The three trips disrupted rush hour traffic in New York City and the annual lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, something that very much cost the public time and money. The only winner was Obama, who flew home with $2.4 million.

            <description>Scandal: The Justice Department has sealed court records detailing the circumstances of a border patrol agent&apos;s murder by a Mexican drug cartel, including the fact U.S. agents were being hunted with U.S.-supplied weapons.

The murder of Border Patrol Agent Bryan Terry by Mexican drug cartels with weapons provided by his own government is a national disgrace.

Attorney General Eric Holder, who professes being out of the loop regarding Operation Fast and Furious, the ATF program that got Terry killed, is doing his best to keep the American people from the truth.

            <title>NLRB Ruling Shows No End To Its Pro-Union Bias  12.1.11</title>
            <description>Unions: The National Labor Relations Board continued to serve its union masters this week when it moved forward on a new pro-union &quot;microwave&quot; election rule. Perhaps it&apos;s time to nuke the NLRB instead.

The rule, first drafted in June, would dramatically shorten the time between when a union gets signatures needed to hold an election and the election itself — cutting it to as little as 10 days from what today is typically five to six weeks.

It would also limit evidence that could be brought to initial hearings and postpone legal challenges until after the election, rendering them all but moot.

            <title>Fed Leads Other Central Banks In Applying Band-Aid   11.30.11</title>
            <description>Debt Crisis: Led by the Fed, top central banks added dollars to the global financial system on Wednesday as Europe&apos;s crisis deepened. We hate to rain on anyone&apos;s parade, but this won&apos;t solve the EU&apos;s problems.

The central banks&apos; bold action, though met with wild enthusiasm by financial markets, amounts to little more than a multibillion dollar Band-Aid on a deep, dangerous wound.

It also turns the U.S. Federal Reserve into Europe&apos;s lender of last resort — a dangerous precedent, and something we don&apos;t recall American voters approving, though they&apos;ll certainly pay up if it fails. Obviously the Fed, worried the EU&apos;s crisis will take down the U.S., thinks the risk is worth it.

We understand the fear. The central banks&apos; coordinated move came after desperate European officials said they might boost the size of their $600 billion emergency bailout fund and seek financial help from the IMF.

Central banks also see signs of an EU credit crunch that could sink the world — and U.S. — economies.

As Reuters aptly put it, &quot;investors are fleeing the euro zone bond market, European banks are dumping government debt, south European banks are bleeding deposits, and a recession looms, fueling doubts about the survival of the single currency.&quot;

            <title>Weather’s Too Nice For Global Warming Alarmists  11.30.11</title>
            <description>Environment: Sunday will be the 2,232nd consecutive day that the U.S. has gone without being hit by a major hurricane. This is a big enough deal to be covered by the mainstream media. But of course it won&apos;t be.

On Dec. 4, a new record will be set for the number of days between landfalls of category 3 or stronger storms. The previous streak, according to Roger Pielke Jr., began on Sept. 8, 1900, and ended on Oct. 19, 1906, when the Great Galveston Hurricane hit.

The record won&apos;t be broken by just a day or even a week. Pielke, a professor of environmental studies at University of Colorado, says it will be crushed.

&quot;Since there won&apos;t be any intense hurricanes before next summer, the record will be shattered, with the days between intense hurricane landfalls likely to exceed 2,500 days,&quot; he writes in his blog.

Why is this significant? Because the global warming alarmists have been telling us that man&apos;s carbon dioxide emissions would bring bigger storms.

Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology promoted the idea in a 2005 paper. He claimed that in the mid-1970s global warming began causing hurricane destruction to increase. Emanuel believed that the damage would grow worse.

            <itunes:summary>Environment: Sunday will be the 2,232nd consecutive day that the U.S. has gone without being hit by a major hurricane. This is a big enough deal to be covered by the mainstream media. But of course it won&apos;t be.

On Dec. 4, a new record will be set for the number of days between landfalls of category 3 or stronger storms. The previous streak, according to Roger Pielke Jr., began on Sept. 8, 1900, and ended on Oct. 19, 1906, when the Great Galveston Hurricane hit.

The record won&apos;t be broken by just a day or even a week. Pielke, a professor of environmental studies at University of Colorado, says it will be crushed.

&quot;Since there won&apos;t be any intense hurricanes before next summer, the record will be shattered, with the days between intense hurricane landfalls likely to exceed 2,500 days,&quot; he writes in his blog.

Why is this significant? Because the global warming alarmists have been telling us that man&apos;s carbon dioxide emissions would bring bigger storms.

Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology promoted the idea in a 2005 paper. He claimed that in the mid-1970s global warming began causing hurricane destruction to increase. Emanuel believed that the damage would grow worse.</itunes:summary>

            <title>For Democrats Class Warfare Trumps Job Creation  11.30.11</title>
            <description>Taxes: With unemployment chronically high, how does taxing more than a third of small-business income make sense? Politically, that&apos;s how. The Democrats&apos; dead-on-arrival surtax is a campaign ploy, not a jobs strategy.

At a time when leadership is sorely needed to get America back to work, President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi just can&apos;t move beyond class war. It&apos;s a potent political strategy because it unfailingly attracts voters ignorant of economics.

A real leader learns from failures. It may have taken President Bush too long to order the surge in Iraq, but he ultimately recognized the defects of a strategy that risked another Vietnam-style surrender for America.

Admitting that their big-spending stimulus failed is the first step to getting to work with Republicans on a jobs policy that actually produces jobs.

But Obama, Reid and Pelosi, with their unconscionable record of incompetence and corruption in handling the economy over the past five years, refuse.

            <title>Will The EPA Choke Oil Shale Production  11.30.11</title>
            <description>New Energy: The latest salvo in the administration&apos;s war on energy may be new rules and permits to regulate a process to get oil and gas from porous rock, sacrificing jobs and economic growth while under review.

There are a few areas of the U.S. that are booming. Two of these are in North Dakota and Pennsylvania, states that sit atop two massive shale rock formations, the Bakken and the Marcellus.

Extraction of oil and natural gas from these formations have created jobs and economic growth in the midst of a stagnant and parched economy.

The oil and gas is extracted from this porous rock by a process called hydraulic fracturing, or &quot;fracking.&quot;

The process involves the injection under high pressure of fluids, mainly water with a few chemical additives, to fracture the porous shale rock and allow the release and extraction of the oil and gas trapped inside the porous rock. Environmentalists contend these chemical additives contaminate groundwater supplies.

            <title>Anti-Bank Dem Maxine Waters Rises On Key Financial Panel  11.29.11</title>
            <description>Rules: If you thought Rep. Barney Frank was bad, his likely replacement is worse. Rep. Maxine Waters is Congress&apos; most anti-bank member — unless she owns stock in one, that is.

Waters is in line to take over from Frank on the powerful Financial Services Committee when he retires next year. On financial issues, the California liberal is even left of Frank, who was the chief architect of the disastrous banking overhaul bill bearing his name.

&quot;As the next most senior member of the committee, I hope to use my experience to continue and expand his work in the committee,&quot; Waters said. &quot;I will continue to champion practical regulations.&quot;

            <title>Tax Credits Offset Regulation’s Economic Drain  11.29.11</title>
            <description>Red Tape: Federal regulation exacts a heavy toll on the economy. If the Republicans win the White House and Congress next year, it&apos;s up to the party of less government to do something about it. But what?

Governments regulate business with little or no thought to the costs and headaches they impose. The Small Business Administration, a part of the federal apparatus, estimates the cost of regulation to be $1.75 trillion a year, or one-seventh the national income. State-level regulations cost the California economy alone almost $500 billion annually.

Though policymakers and government functionaries appear to be oblivious to the damage they wreak, the price of regulation is real. So is the pain. Businesses have to comply with an entangling web of rules — from professional licensing to construction approval to edicts about waste removal, building design and hiring, not to mention commandments that smother firms.

            <title>Want To Be Carbon-Free? Bring On The Nukes  11.29.11</title>
            <description>California: A new study provides a road map to a carbon-free future. Just one problem: Something has to produce the juice for all those electric cars, and it can&apos;t be just the sun and the wind.

It&apos;s been five years since California passed its ambitious law to cut greenhouse-gas emissions. So far, the state shows no sign that it really understands what it has set out to accomplish.

The near-term goal of cutting greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2020 is tough enough. The 2006 law also requires a further 80% cut in the following 30 years.

            <title>Badly-Needed Alaskan Oil Is Kept From Market By Obama Decision  11.29.11</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: The same administration that says we can and should get oil from the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska is blocking a bridge needed to get it to market on environmental grounds.

In his May 14 weekly radio address, President Obama called for annual lease sales in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPRA), not necessarily out of any conviction that increased domestic energy supply is good for prices and national security, but basically to perpetuate the myth that the oil companies refuse to drill in leased or leasable areas.

While he restricts oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas off the north coast of Alaska, and imposes outright moratoriums on federal lands and off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, Obama wants the appearance, if not the reality, of supporting domestic energy production from fossil fuels.

            <title>A Shooting War With Pakistan?  11.28.11</title>
            <description>War On Terror: The latest deadly Afghan border skirmish between U.S.-led troops and Pakistani troops indicates that the war may be expanding to include our putative ally. But are we prepared?

In what&apos;s become a common occurrence, the Pakistani military — in an unprovoked attack — fired on coalition troops based across the border in Afghanistan. We responded by hitting two Pakistani border posts. The airstrikes killed two dozen Pakistani soldiers, sparking anti-American riots and threats of reprisal by Islamabad.

It&apos;s hardly the first direct attack on our forces by Pakistan, and the attackers aren&apos;t merely a few rogue elements of its military who are sympathetic to the Taliban and al-Qaida. But attacks have become so frequent that our troops can no longer just duck and cover while pretending Pakistan has our back in this war. We have to return fire to protect the lives of U.S. and NATO soldiers.

            <title>Loved by media, Barney Frank Helped Cause Financial Crisis  11.28.11</title>
            <description>Congress: Establishment media are swooning over the unexpected departure of ultraliberal Barney Frank. But this &quot;champion of the little guy&quot; actually helped cause the mortgage disaster, then kept the system broken.

&apos;Congress will now be a little dumber,&quot; was the kind of nonsense we heard from the mainstream liberal media after Frank, D-Mass., former chairman of the House Banking Committee, said no to running for re-election next year.

Formally reprimanded by a heavily Democratic House on a 408-to-18 vote in 1990 for ethics offenses regarding his financial relationship with a male prostitute, Frank has for decades been a fast-talking, acidic presence in House debates.

Formally reprimanded by a heavily Democratic House on a 408-to-18 vote in 1990 for ethics offenses regarding his financial relationship with a male prostitute, Frank has for decades been a fast-talking, acidic presence in House debates.</itunes:summary>

            <title>E-Car Fires: Big Bump In The Road  11.28.11</title>
            <description>Industrial Policy: The investigation into the safety of electric car batteries intensifies after additional fires involving the flagship of a proposed electric vehicle fleet. Central planning doesn&apos;t work for cars or insurance.

When the Toyota Prius was being accused of having overlooked design flaws that were causing accelerators to get stuck with fatal results, the owners of Government Motors, a competitor, wasted little time pushing for a recall and congressional hearings while accusing Toyota of cutting corners for the sake of corporate profits.

We wonder if the same sense of urgency will prevail in the wake of new safety tests indicating that an earlier test in which a Chevy Volt experienced a battery fire three weeks after a side-impact test was no fluke and that the car&apos;s lithium-ion battery poses a fire hazard.

            <title>Ezra Klein: From &apos;Journolist&apos; To Liberal Activist  11.28.11</title>
            <description>Media Bias: In the early days of the Gulf War, pundits marveled at the specter of Iraqi troops surrendering to journalists. Well, now it&apos;s even worse: Journalists are giving the Democratic Party its talking points.

The Washington Post&apos;s 27-year-old star blogger Ezra Klein has been called &quot;whiz kid,&quot; and &quot;brat packer&quot; and a &quot;wunderkind.&quot; Now he&apos;s actually advising Democratic chiefs of staff, briefing them last week about the supercommittee in Congress, according to a report by Fishbowl-DC on MediaBistro.com.

That means the relatively novel idea that bloggers can be placed on an equal footing with reporters in congressional briefings has been one-upped: Bloggers like Klein are now giving the briefings.

            <description>Middle East: Mass bloodshed followed by Islamist rule is in Egypt&apos;s future thanks to President Obama&apos;s Mideast destabilization policy. A hijacked &quot;Arab Spring&quot; isn&apos;t limited to the land of the pharaohs, either.

A promise of mid-2012 presidential elections hasn&apos;t appeased Cairo&apos;s demonstrators, who demand an immediate end to the military rule that began after the ouster of dependable U.S. ally Hosni Mubarak as president early this year.

A round of parliamentary elections are promised for next week, but dozens have died in the clashes of the last several days. Unfortunately, ordered liberty doesn&apos;t come naturally to cultures that have never known it.

            <description>Education: Would Americans put up with Marxist indoctrination in classrooms on the public dime? So why is Arizona still battling the disguised grievance-politics radicalism known as Latino &quot;ethnic studies&quot; in its schools?

Last May, Arizona&apos;s state legislature passed a law outlawing divisive chauvinistic ethnic studies classes that promote grievance, separatism and the overthrow of the U.S. government.

Sounds obvious, but in Arizona, the ethnic-studies teaching had gotten so bad in Tucson&apos;s public schools that Che Guevara was openly displayed on the walls and schoolchildren were taught that Benjamin Franklin was a racist, according to the Los Angeles Times.

When Geron Corp. announced in January 2010 that the first clinical trial using its embryonic stem cells to treat an actual human patient was under way, its stock shot up 6.4%.

Geron got the first Food and Drug Administration license to use embryonic stem cells to treat people in a clinical trial, in this case patients with a spinal cord injury.

The media portray Clinton, who acts as if he were still president, as some kind of hero riding in to save the economy. But it was his own policies that wrecked it.

And now he&apos;s covering up his fault by blaming others, when in fact he forced banks to make high-risk loans in the name of diversity.

            <description>Government: Brandishing misleading employer survey data, Senate leader Harry Reid claims there isn&apos;t &quot;a single shred of evidence&quot; regulations cause big economic harm. Even President Obama disagrees.

It is self-evident that regulations on business kill jobs. Rules add costs. And the simplest way for a firm to recoup big expenses is by cutting salaries or by not adding new salaries.

With unemployment at 9%, it makes sense that Republicans are pointing to the Obama administration&apos;s over-regulation as one of the culprits. As the Heritage Foundation noted in July:

            <description>Politics: The former White House chief of staff journeys to Iowa to trash the Republican presidential field. As the ship of state continues to sink, the former first mate ignores the iceberg he helped steer us into.

One would think that Rahm Emanuel, currently mayor of Chicago, would be busy fixing the fiscal mess his city, birthplace of the &quot;Chicago way&quot; of politics and government, is in.

Illinois is imploding under a Democratic governor who is taxing businesses and jobs out of the state. But Emanuel was in Iowa, knocking Republicans and blaming them for all that ails America.

            <title>For Supercommittee, Failure Was the Only Option   11.21.11</title>
            <description>The Debt Crisis: The &quot;failure&quot; of the supercommittee is better described as a success. Republicans stood firm against new taxes and got what they set out to achieve: deficit reduction that relies 100% on spending cuts.

With the supercommittee&apos;s demise, Washington went into finger-pointing mode. Democrats and Republicans blamed each other for not budging on taxes. Mitt Romney blamed President Obama for his lack of leadership. And while Obama hasn&apos;t blamed anyone yet, we&apos;re pretty sure it won&apos;t be himself.

This blame game is woefully misguided. Given the political environment, Republicans were right to hang tough on tax hikes, take the $1.2 trillion in spending reductions, and hope Obama loses the next election so we can finally get serious about our debt crisis.

            <title>Too Few Of Us Still Believe Our Culture Is Superior   11.21.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: A few years ago, six in 10 of us believed our culture was superior to others. Now less than half think so. How much does this have to do with electing a president who doesn&apos;t believe in America?

Pew Poll results released last week show that only 49% of Americans agree with the statement: &quot;Our people are not perfect, but our culture is superior to others.&quot; Nine years ago, 60% agreed with that account; four years ago, 55% still felt that way.

Cultural relativists — often the same folks as those who hate America — will celebrate the slide. But it&apos;s nothing to be pleased about. If Americans have stopped believing in American cultural superiority, then isn&apos;t America in decline as well?

            <title>Is Election Win By Spanish Conservatives A Mandate To End Socialism?   11.21.11</title>
            <description>Election: Spain&apos;s voters have thrown out their ruling Socialists, giving conservatives their most decisive victory since the nation&apos;s return to democracy in 1978. Problems persist, but a shift in political course can only help.

Unlike, say, California&apos;s voters, Spain&apos;s voters knew enough to stop digging when the hole got too deep. As one of Europe&apos;s troubled PIIGS — a tag it shares with Greece, Ireland, Italy and Portugal — it&apos;s riven by soaring spending on its welfare state and surging debt.

But instead of elect more of the same (as California did), or slightly change course (as Ireland and Portugal did), or move to technocratic rule (as Italy and Greece did), Spain just plain shifted course — big time.

            <title>Taxpayers Get Bigger Bill From GM, Chrysler Bailout    11.18.11</title>
            <description>Reckless Spending: The administration said taxpayers would make a profit on the auto bailout. It was a promise less reliable than one pledged by the proverbial used-car salesman. The bailout losses continue to mount.

The Treasury Department issued a new estimate last week, indicating losses on the bailout will be $23.6 billion, more than 65% higher than the previous estimate of $14.3 billion. Including payments made to auto industry suppliers, the total cost of the General Motors/Chrysler bailout is roughly $85 billion.

A year or so ago, about the time of GM&apos;s post-bailout IPO, President Obama said that &quot;American taxpayers are now positioned to recover more than my administration invested in GM.&quot;

That promise was reiterated last month when White House economist Gene Sperling, who called the bailout a &quot;very, very positive story,&quot; told CNN&apos;s Erin Burnett that &quot;the taxpayer is making a profit.&quot;

Twelve months after General Motors&apos; IPO, the federal government still owns 500 million shares of GM. That&apos;s a bit more that one-fourth of the company&apos;s value and less than half of what Washington initially owned. And the prospects aren&apos;t inspiring.

GM&apos;s worth continues to fall. On Jan. 7, GM stock closed at $38.98 a share. By October, it had fallen below $20. It closed Friday below $22.

            <title>Americans Want Spending Cut — But Hands Off Their Benefits   11.18.11</title>
            <description>Budget Policy: Americans broadly agree that government has gotten too big and that spending needs to be cut. Great. But just what should be cut? On that, their message is a bit more muddled.

Perhaps not surprisingly in these days of trillion- dollar deficits and $15 trillion-plus in total debt, a recent poll found that six of 10 Americans back cutting the federal budget across the board.

Sounds like a clear majority for big cuts. But when the latest IBD/TIPP Poll asked what, exactly, should be cut, we got a very different answer. Our survey presented a number of programs — including Medicare, Social Security and defense — and asked 901 Americans if they&apos;d be willing to cut them.

In instance after instance, the answer was no. And overwhelmingly.

Four of five (82%) of those queried said they didn&apos;t want Medicare cut. Three of four (75%) rejected the idea of cuts in Social Security. Defense? Reductions in that perennial budget target were rejected by six in 10 (60%).

Likewise, four of five (80%) opposed raising gasoline taxes, and 55% said lay off the mortgage deduction. Higher corporate taxes? No on that too. In fact, 45% favored lowering taxes on U.S. corporations to the same level found in other nations vs. 40% against such a move.

            <title>The Occupation Should Be On White House Grounds   11.18.11</title>
            <description>Crony Capitalism: As the president embraces Occupy Wall Street, his favorite corporation paid no taxes in 2010 on $14 billion in profits, much of it overseas. Meanwhile, 20,000 jobs for the 99% go unfilled.

At a recent town hall meeting, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, reminded constituents of a story that broke earlier in the year — that General Electric paid no taxes on profit of $14 billion, $9 billion of which was earned overseas.

Ryan related how he had asked a GE tax officer the length of GE&apos;s tax filing. The tax guy said it was filed electronically but if it had been printed out he reckoned about 57,000 pages. This speaks both to the complexity and unfairness of the tax code.

The Occupy Wall Street movement, with an incoherent agenda that rails against income inequality and the evils of capitalism, ignores the fact that what we are practicing is not true capitalism, the version where businesses and entrepreneurs are allowed to compete on a truly level playing field to reap the rewards or be allowed to fail.

Instead, businesses large and small are encumbered by regulations and a byzantine tax code designed not to raise money for the needed functions of government but to reward or punish the behavior of corporations and individuals as the government sees fit.

            <title>Obama Bad-mouths America Abroad — Again  11.18.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: The president is at it again, bad-mouthing the U.S. abroad. Last week he told Australians that our kids are &quot;behind&quot; in education and that the solution is — what else? — more government spending. Let&apos;s unpack that.

To start, normal presidents don&apos;t go around to other countries telling the locals that their country&apos;s schoolchildren are underachievers. Not Obama. &quot;A lot of poor children don&apos;t get the support they need when they&apos;re very young,&quot; Obama told a roomful of inquiring students down under. &quot;So by the time they get to grammar school, they&apos;re behind.&quot;

From that, Australians can only take home the message that American students are slow-witted and that admiration for U.S. education is misplaced.

It&apos;s part of a pattern he has, of going abroad, calling American CEOs &quot;lazy,&quot; bowing to despots, and delivering one &quot;blame America first&quot; apology after another.

But more to the point, Obama&apos;s bad-mouthing of U.S. kids smacks of domestic politics by repeating the tiresome complaint that U.S. taxpayers aren&apos;t shelling out enough for an education system that is already loaded.

In 2010, Obama lavished $63 billion on the U.S. Department of Education — twice what DOE got in 1997. Now he&apos;s asking for another $68 billion.

U.S. schoolteachers don&apos;t make enough money, Obama told the Australians, asking: &quot;How do we pay them more?&quot; Teachers, in fact, are already well-paid.

From them he&apos;s taking upward of $60 million campaign cash in 2012 courtesy of the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers. That&apos;s on top of the $50 million they gave him in 2008.

            <description>Ethics: As Democrats demonize Wall Street CEOs as the &quot;greedy&quot; fiends of the financial crisis, they&apos;ve lined their own pockets — both before and after the crisis. Nancy Pelosi&apos;s just the latest example.

The former House speaker allegedly gamed financial reforms to boost her personal stock portfolio. The brewing scandal is complicated, but here&apos;s the Reader&apos;s Digest version:

After a Pelosi staffer left to lobby on behalf of credit-card giant Visa, Pelosi delayed bringing to the House floor a bill to end lucrative &quot;swipe fees&quot; for Visa and other credit providers.

            <title>An Occupy Movement Based On 99% Lies   11.17.11</title>
            <description>Inequality: As cities rousted Occupiers, liberals claimed the movement has already succeeded by calling attention to income inequality. But all it&apos;s really done is give the left an excuse to recycle bogus class-warfare claims.

Soon after Mayor Bloomberg cleared the Occupiers out of New York&apos;s Zuccotti Park, Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein reassured his fellow liberals. &quot;The movement has already scored some big wins,&quot; he wrote, because it has &quot;changed the national conversation.&quot; The evidence? The press has written lots of stories about income inequality lately.

Of course, counting news stories proves nothing. The liberal media love the Occupy crowd and what it stands for, and so it generously flooded the zone with adoring coverage, while carefully covering up the movement&apos;s violence, depravity and anti-American radicalism.

            <title>Steven Chu Should Lose His Job Over The Solyndra Scandal   11.17.11</title>
            <description>Corruption: The Secretary of Energy takes responsibility for and defends the granting of a half-billion-dollar-loan guarantee to an imploding solar panel maker. But that&apos;s not where the campaign donor buck stopped.

In testimony Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Steven Chu, caught in a tangled web of administration deceit regarding a $535 million guaranteed loan to Solyndra, tried but failed to continue the administration line that the affair was just a good-faith bet that went bad.

&quot;As the Secretary of Energy, the final decisions on Solyndra were mine, and I made them with the best interest of the taxpayer in mind,&quot; Chu claimed in his opening statement. &quot;I want to be clear: Over the course of Solyndra&apos;s loan guarantee, I did not make any decision based on political considerations.&quot;

            <title>Democrats For Election Fraud   11.16.11</title>
            <description>Suffrage: We&apos;re used to Democrats&apos; trotting out the Republicans-are-racists trope whenever they want to score a political point. But even we can&apos;t believe they&apos;re doing it to block reasonable protections against election fraud.

This week, Maryland&apos;s Rep. Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, claimed that &quot;we are witnessing a concerted effort to place new obstacles in front of minorities, low-income families and young people who seek to exercise their right to vote.&quot;

Earlier in the month, NAACP president Benjamin Jealous declared that &quot;this is the greatest assault on voting rights, happening right now, that we have seen since the dawn of Jim Crow.&quot;

It all sounds so menacing. Except that these liberals are excoriating Republicans for supporting what the vast majority of Americans agree is a perfectly reasonable requirement for voters — that they show a photo ID before casting a ballot.

This year, three states enacted photo ID laws, and three others toughened their existing laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In all, 31 states now require voters to show some sort of ID, with 15 requiring a photo ID.

            <title>Mob Judges  11.16.11</title>
            <description>The Law: A New York judge on Tuesday came very close to turning the Occupy Wall Street mob into a permanent fixture. When elitist jurists take the side of criminal anarchy, ordered liberty is gravely endangered.

Delivering the Manhattan Institute&apos;s Wriston Lecture last week, British historian commentator Niall Ferguson credited the rule of law — not democracy — as one of the key factors that led the West to economic global dominance for centuries.

&quot;It was out of the rule of law, out of the common law, that the power of a representative body evolved,&quot; Ferguson said, citing protection of private property rights.

The rule of law is what separates America from unstable banana republics and assures that peaceful citizens who vote trump the demands of violent hordes.

But when New York City started to remove the throngs of sewage-strewn, obscenely behaving Occupy Wall Street demonstrators from Zuccotti Park in lower Manhattan, New York State Supreme Court Judge Lucy Billings stepped in against the NYPD following a petition from the National Lawyers Guild — an outfit exposed decades ago as &quot;the legal mouthpiece of the Communist Party&quot; by the U.S. Justice Department.

            <title>Asia Rediscovers Its Love For America  11.16.11</title>
            <description>Global Power: Much is being made of China&apos;s unease at President Obama&apos;s initiative this week to raise the U.S. presence in the Pacific Rim. The real story is Asia&apos;s unease with China&apos;s expansionism. It wants America back.

Beijing was taken by surprise at the U.S. president&apos;s newfound interest in making America a presence again in the Pacific.

But in reality it was a sign that Asian states prefer a U.S.-centric Pacific over a China-centric one.

On his visit to Hawaii, Bali and Australia, Obama announced that 2,500 U.S. troops would be stationed in northern Australia, a move welcomed with open arms not just by Australia but across the Pacific.

Obama also announced that the &quot;broad outlines&quot; of the Trans-Pacific Partnership eight-nation free trade zone were advancing, with major new nations — Japan, Canada and Mexico seeking entry — a big vote of confidence in America from a region that accounts for 60% of world trade. The State Department, meanwhile, announced a big, generous aid package for flood-ravaged Thailand.

Coming on the heels of Obama&apos;s signature on the U.S.-South Korea free trade treaty, the signal is unmistakable: America&apos;s back after a long period of neglect, and &quot;We&apos;re here to stay,&quot; as Obama said.

            <title>Elena Kagan Must Be Recused In ObamaCare Case   11.15.11</title>
            <description>Supreme Court: Should a justice who participated in ObamaCare&apos;s creation recuse herself from the court&apos;s review of that law? Of course. But then a nominee who lies in confirmation hearings shouldn&apos;t be on the court anyway.

If Justice Elena Kagan were a person of character, she would sit out the Supreme Court&apos;s hearing of the challenge to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

But during her confirmation hearings in June of last year, she indicated she would not. And since this Monday, when the court announced it would take the case, she has done nothing to suggest she will recuse herself after all. Nor has the court made any statement about her recusal, a convention it usually follows when a justice takes himself or herself off a case.

He condemned this rogue element for having the temerity to blame Washington. &quot;These people are engaged in an active campaign to rewrite history,&quot; he complained. &quot;They are winning.&quot;

            <description>Environmental Impacts: An investigation is launched into the possibility of battery fires occurring in crashes involving Government Motors&apos; touted electric car. Industrial policy meets the law of unintended consequences.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has announced an investigation into the safety of electric cars using lithium batteries, particularly the Chevy Volt, after a battery fire occurred after a side-impact crash test.

It has asked other manufacturers who make electric cars or that plan to do so for information on how they handle lithium-ion batteries. The request also includes recommendations for minimizing fire risk. The feds say this is only precautionary and there is no indication of widespread risk. GM insists the Volt is safe.

            <title>Is U.S. &apos;Lazy&apos; On Investment?   11.15.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: President Obama told CEOs in Hawaii that the U.S. had been &quot;lazy&quot; in attracting foreign investment. Actually, the White House has been pretty busy demonizing it.

The Obama administration has a record of making life miserable for foreign investors that put their capital on the line to create jobs in the U.S.

Politically wedded to special interests such as Big Labor, White House officials have hurled scurrilous charges against foreign companies and muscled others in ways no domestic company would tolerate.

            <title>A Revolving Door Of Media Bias   11.15.11</title>
            <description>News: Liberal presidential daughter Chelsea Clinton getting a high-profile broadcast gig at NBC Nightly News is only the latest example of the press&apos; ideological double standard. Who &quot;reports&quot; influences how voters decide.

&apos;It&apos;s the request of the president and Mrs. Clinton that Chelsea be allowed to have as normal a childhood as possible while living at the White House,&quot; the White House demanded — and the press obeyed.

As the Washington Post reported in 1996, when Chelsea celebrated her Sweet 16 birthday, &quot;Chelsea has blossomed, by all accounts, into a smart, charming, funny, normal 16-year-old. Which is pretty extraordinary, given the circumstances.&quot;

            <title>Will The Court Free America From ObamaCare?  11.14.11</title>
            <description>Tyranny Or Freedom: The Supreme Court announced Monday it will consider the constitutionality of ObamaCare in the spring. Nothing less than the future of liberty is at stake.

The justices will listen to 5 1/2 hours of oral arguments over two days on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a time allotment that shows just how important they think this case is. Veteran Supreme Court observer Lyle Denniston of Bloomberg&apos;s SCOTUS blog said the extended hours appear to be &quot;a modern record.&quot;

The justices reportedly expect to make a decision by June. Whenever it comes, they&apos;d better get it right.

            <title>A Country Unworthy Of Its President  11.14.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: We&apos;re starting to grasp how hard a job the president has. It can&apos;t be easy to rule a country filled with so many soft, lazy, greedy fat cats who can&apos;t make good stuff anymore.

At a business forum Saturday, President Obama complained that &quot;we&apos;ve been a little bit lazy over the last couple of decades.&quot; He apparently meant we&apos;ve let foreign investment go slack, since &quot;we aren&apos;t out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America.&quot;

But this is just the latest slur against the United States uttered by its leader.

            <description>Debates: It may not give us Lincoln-Douglas, but trimming the GOP field would make for a more probing, informative exchange of views. For a way to do this, look at the polls.

With 10 down and 14 (at last count) to go, the Republican Party debate marathon has reached the natural end of the cattle-call phase.

This has been the audition time, when most of the declared candidates get their chance to get in front of the camera, speak their lines and hope that lightning strikes.

            <description>Foreign Policy: Of all the &quot;change&quot; seen under President Obama, reclassifying Russia from adversary to friend may be the most overlooked. Nearly everything Moscow does is antithetical to U.S. interests.

&apos;Although we must not shy away from pushing for more democracy and accountability in Russia, we must work with the country in areas of common interest,&quot; candidate Barack Obama wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine in 2007.

He vowed to &quot;work with Russia to update and scale back our dangerously outdated Cold War nuclear postures and de-emphasize the role of nuclear weapons.&quot;

            <title>Mexico Under Siege  11.11.11</title>
            <description>Border: The helicopter crash Friday that killed Mexico&apos;s top Cabinet official, Jose Francisco Blake, couldn&apos;t have come at a worse time. Cartels are acquiring heavy arms to challenge the state and to move their war to the U.S.

In Mexico, Blake, the Interior Secretary, was the best hope of winning the war against the vicious cartels, who&apos;ve killed as many as 86,000 people.

Blake, 45, had managed to crush the cartels and cut crime in his native Tijuana before he was asked to do the same for the country in the top Cabinet job in 2010.

He had some success — five of the top seven cartel capos were knocked off by the end of his watch.

But he&apos;s the second interior secretary killed in a helicopter crash since 2008, and that leaves a great sense of uneasiness. Mexico&apos;s currency fell on news of his death, the cause of which is still undetermined.

One thing is known: As Mexico fights, the cartels have been bulking up. They&apos;ve expanded their firepower and extended their reach into the U.S. Addressing this issue should be a top U.S. policy priority. But as Mexico mourns, this war is going largely unnoticed in the U.S.

            <title>Strained By Its Debts, EU Is Breaking Up  11.11.11</title>
            <description>Euro Zone: It&apos;s been clear for some time that the European Union is in deep trouble. But now even its own leaders admit something shocking: The EU, and its currency the euro, may soon be a thing of the past.

The EU has had a troubled existence since the euro was first rolled out on Jan. 1, 1999. Sure, the EU has advantages — a single currency, one giant market, freedom of movement for a well-educated workforce, all benefits. Still, it&apos;s impossible to have an economic union based on rules no one follows. And that&apos;s exactly what&apos;s happened in the EU.

Under the 1993 Maastricht Treaty, no EU country was allowed to run a budget deficit of more than 3% of GDP or issue public debt in excess of 60% of GDP. This was to be the bedrock of the EU&apos;s financial stability.

In recent years, Greece, Ireland and Portugal have all run deficits over 10% of GDP. Worse, the debts of Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain average 112% of GDP. In short, the countries on the EU&apos;s periphery have used membership as a way to redistribute wealth from Europe&apos;s rich north to its poorer south.

            <title>Don&apos;t Stop Doubting  11.11.11</title>
            <description>Climate: Just a few weeks ago, a formerly skeptical scientist made news when he changed his mind about global warming. If he looked at the new data a meteorologist has pulled up, he&apos;d change it back again.

Richard Muller, a physics professor at the University of California, said that data from his Berkeley Earth Surface Temperatures (BEST) project convinced him that &quot;global warming is real.&quot; &quot;We see no evidence,&quot; he said Oct. 21, that global warming has &quot;slowed down.&quot;

The alarmists, of course, leveraged Muller&apos;s statements to suit their agenda.

But Muller&apos;s is not the &quot;consensus&quot; position of the team. Judith Curry, a Georgia Tech climate researcher with more than 30 years experience who was also part of the BEST project, has said &quot;there is no scientific basis for saying that warming hasn&apos;t stopped.&quot; She looked at the same data Muller did and noted it shows global temperatures haven&apos;t increased since the late 1990s.

Now comes meteorologist Anthony Watts armed with data showing the continental U.S. has not warmed in the last 10 years, and in fact has grown cooler in the summer and colder in the winter. The numbers aren&apos;t a collection of weather forecasts from Watts, who runs the website &quot;Watts Up With That,&quot; but data from the National Climatic Data Center.

Granted, the Lower 48 aren&apos;t the entire world, only a small slice of it. But it is a large portion of the developed world, a significant contributor of man-made carbon dioxide emissions and full of &quot;heat islands&quot; — big cities — that should be skewing temperature data upward.

Yet, that&apos;s not what&apos;s happening. The 2001-to-2011 trend shows a cooling of 0.87 degrees Fahrenheit compared with the 1911-2010 average. Backing up the starting date to 1996 doesn&apos;t help the alarmists&apos; case, either. Temperatures are flat over that period.

            <itunes:summary>Climate: Just a few weeks ago, a formerly skeptical scientist made news when he changed his mind about global warming. If he looked at the new data a meteorologist has pulled up, he&apos;d change it back again.

Richard Muller, a physics professor at the University of California, said that data from his Berkeley Earth Surface Temperatures (BEST) project convinced him that &quot;global warming is real.&quot; &quot;We see no evidence,&quot; he said Oct. 21, that global warming has &quot;slowed down.&quot;

The alarmists, of course, leveraged Muller&apos;s statements to suit their agenda.

But Muller&apos;s is not the &quot;consensus&quot; position of the team. Judith Curry, a Georgia Tech climate researcher with more than 30 years experience who was also part of the BEST project, has said &quot;there is no scientific basis for saying that warming hasn&apos;t stopped.&quot; She looked at the same data Muller did and noted it shows global temperatures haven&apos;t increased since the late 1990s.

Now comes meteorologist Anthony Watts armed with data showing the continental U.S. has not warmed in the last 10 years, and in fact has grown cooler in the summer and colder in the winter. The numbers aren&apos;t a collection of weather forecasts from Watts, who runs the website &quot;Watts Up With That,&quot; but data from the National Climatic Data Center.

Granted, the Lower 48 aren&apos;t the entire world, only a small slice of it. But it is a large portion of the developed world, a significant contributor of man-made carbon dioxide emissions and full of &quot;heat islands&quot; — big cities — that should be skewing temperature data upward.

            <title>Sticking Our Head In Tar Sands   11.11.11</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: The administration plans to study rerouting the Keystone XL pipeline until after next year&apos;s election, delaying needed jobs and energy. By that time, Canada&apos;s oil will be on its way to China.

That the American people are merely human sacrifices on the altar of environmentalism is seen by Thursday&apos;s announcement by the State Department that it has caved in to greenie demands that the Keystone XL pipeline intended to bring Canadian tar sands oil to the American market be rerouted around an aquifer that supplies water to eight states.

The process will take at least a year, kicking the oil can down the road past the November 2012 election. It is our fear that if President Obama is re-elected, the project will be scuttled permanently. That may be a moot point because as we have noted Canada is quite ready to run a pipeline to its West Coast and send its tar sands oil to an energy-hungry China.

Political considerations weighed heavily in the decision by an administration in which re-election trumps everything else, whether it be rising energy prices or the need for jobs. Environmentalists had warned the administration they might find other things to do in 2012 if Keystone XL was approved.

&quot;This is not just about LCV (League of Conservation Voters), which spent nearly $1 million to help elect Obama in 2008, or any other group that engages in electoral politics in the upcoming election,&quot; said Tiernan Sittenfeld, the league&apos;s senior vice president for government affairs, in a not-so-veiled threat.

            <description>Election &apos;12: GOP presidential contenders are making a comedy of errors of what should be a cakewalk 2012 victory for the eventual nominee. With so much at stake, gaffes and misjudgments just aren&apos;t acceptable.

&apos;Victory however long and hard the road may be,&quot; Churchill implored a mortally threatened Britain. &quot;For without victory there is no survival.&quot;

The Republican candidates for president need an injection of wartime-style urgency.  No one accepted incompetence as we fought the Nazis during World War II. Americans demanded that excellence be commonplace — from war-room drawing boards to local scrap drives.

            <description>Mideast: Official rumors have Israel attacking Iran&apos;s nuclear program sometime in the next month or so. If that turns out to be true, the Israelis will be doing the rest of the world a favor — though they&apos;ll never be thanked for it.

Amid a flurry of missile tests and other signs of military preparedness, Israel looks like it&apos;s gearing up to do something big.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak are already reportedly making military contingency plans for taking out Iran&apos;s nukes.

Donald Trump, who should know better, has even said &quot;we don&apos;t manufacture anything anymore in this country.&quot;

But the U.S. is still the world&apos;s factory champion. September was the country&apos;s 14th straight month of industrial growth.

            <title>Holder Lies Again  11.09.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: Refusing to apologize to the family of a border patrol killed by a gun &quot;walked&quot; into Mexico, the attorney general hides his prior knowledge and blames Congress for not pushing gun control.

Holder must reside in a parallel universe with an alternate and quite flexible timeline. His recollection of what he knew and when he knew it must depend on the meaning of &quot;knew.&quot;

In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Holder said he &quot;first learned about the tactics and the phrase &apos;Operation Fast and Furious&apos; at the beginning of this year — I think when it became a matter of all of this public controversy.&quot;

It became a &quot;matter of public controversy&quot; when Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry was murdered and multiple weapons were found at the scene that were traced to Operation Fast and Furious, a gun-running operation spearheaded by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is under Holder&apos;s Department of Justice. And he read about it in the newspaper?

Assuming that in Holder&apos;s parallel universe, this was true, why then didn&apos;t he bring those responsible to his office and ask what in blazes was going on, get to the bottom of the fiasco and make sure the appropriate heads rolled all the way to the Rio Grande?

            <title>Will Someone Tell Us What Herman Cain Did?  11.09.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: After 10 days of saturation coverage by the media, we still don&apos;t definitely know any more about Herman Cain&apos;s alleged misdeeds than we did when Politico first broke the story. Media balance, anyone?

Since breaking the sexual harassment story about the presidential contender in late October, Politico alone has published more than 100 dispatches. TV networks aired a whopping 99 stories in the first nine days. And the Cain saga continues to merit front page treatment at major newspapers.

Yet with every news outlet working overtime to keep the Cain story alive, we still know next to nothing about what Cain allegedly did. Which is basically right where the story was when Politico broke it in late October.

Indeed, the only actual, undisputed, verifiable facts about this story are that two women filed sexual harassment complaints against Cain more than a decade ago when he was head of the National Restaurant Association, and settled their claims out of court.

            <title>The Grinch Tax  11.09.11</title>
            <description>Government: Are taxes the answer to every business problem? The Obama administration&apos;s attempt to impose a 15-cent federal tax to &quot;enhance the image of Christmas trees&quot; is no way to persuade anyone to buy more trees.

Resembling something out of the Onion, the Heritage Foundation&apos;s David Addington spotted an item buried deep in the Federal Register Tuesday mandating that all live Christmas trees be subject to an additional 15-cent federal &quot;checkoff.&quot; Not a tax, mind you, though the cost would be the same. Simply that checkoff.

The Agriculture Department would raise $2 million from such fees and use the cash to set up a 12-person grower&apos;s board to design and buy ads to promote the purchase of live trees. Like the &quot;Got Milk&quot; ads, these would be the &quot;Got Trees&quot; equivalent.

At bottom, this is a trade dispute. The live tree industry has been losing market share to the artificial tree industry, and the National Christmas Tree Association said it couldn&apos;t persuade its members to raise money for ads on their own. So it wants government help pick its industry as a winner over its artificial tree rivals with this board and its tax.

The live tree industry has been losing market share to the artificial tree industry, and the National Christmas Tree Association said it couldn&apos;t persuade its members to raise money for ads on their own. So it wants government help pick its industry as a winner over its artificial tree rivals with this board and its tax.</itunes:summary>

            <title>ObamaCare Falls In An Ohio Forest  11.09.11</title>
            <description>Bias: The media are celebrating Ohio voters&apos; rejection of GOP initiatives. Predictably, though, they are downplaying the fact that Ohio emphatically renounced ObamaCare. Why? It goes against the media&apos;s agenda.

Casual consumers of the news would think that Ohio voters thoroughly vanquished Republicans and their ideas.

&quot;Voters defeat many GOP-sponsored measures,&quot; says the New York Times.

&quot;Ohio voters reject GOP-backed union limits,&quot; the Washington Post reports.

Across the Atlantic, the British Guardian calls the Ohio results a &quot;blow to Republicans&quot; while America&apos;s Christian Science Monitor reports that Tuesday was &quot;not a banner election for the Tea Party.&quot;

Reuters took things a bit further: &quot;Ohio union victory boosts Obama&apos;s hopes for 2012.&quot;

Granted, Ohio voters rose against Gov. John Kasich&apos;s plan to curb union power and privilege. The former Republican congressman wants limits on collective bargaining for police, firefighters and other public workers to ease the financial burden on the governments — the taxpayers, in reality — who have to fund their cushy arrangements.

            <title>China&apos;s Economy Goes From Boom To Bust  11.08.11</title>
            <description>Global Crisis: The news these days is filled with stories about the euro zone economies and their ongoing crisis. But another, potentially bigger and even more important crisis is brewing — this one in China.

Amid seemingly endless stories about the Chinese Miracle and how China&apos;s soaring economy is about to overtake the U.S. comes news that suggests the death of America as No. 1 may be exaggerated — and, in fact, may be dead wrong.

Indeed, China&apos;s economy may be on the cusp of a major growth reversal.

            <description>Allies: President Obama and France&apos;s Nicolas Sarkozy were caught agreeing privately that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is insufferable. History will rank the Jewish state&apos;s defender above his two critics.

Beware microphones you only think are off. France&apos;s President Sarkozy was recorded confiding to President Obama after a G-20 press conference regarding Bibi Netanyahu, &quot;I cannot stand him. He is a liar,&quot; Obama responded, &quot;You&apos;re fed up with him, but I have to deal with him every day!&quot;

What of President Obama&apos;s other private musings? Ron Suskind in his book &quot;Confidence Men&quot; recently revealed, for instance, his belief that America&apos;s &quot;high unemployment was due to productivity gains in the economy.&quot; Sure, and the coming surgical waiting lists will be due to ObamaCare&apos;s efficiency improvements.

            <title>And Now, Stimulus For Russia  11.08.11</title>
            <description>Industrial Policy: Not only do taxpayers subsidize failing green energy here, they may soon be on the hook for a Department of Energy loan to a firm owned by a Russian billionaire. Just say nyet.

When a foreign firm wants to build a facility in the U.S. that hires American workers and pays American taxes, we welcome it. We&apos;d prefer they do it with their own money, not rely on this administration&apos;s failed industrial policy to provide them with a huge taxpayer-backed loan — especially when it&apos;s owned by a billionaire who doesn&apos;t need the help.

The administration&apos;s latest green boondoggle is a $773 million loan for Severstal North America to expand and retool the old Rouge steel mill in Dearborn, Mich., to manufacture high-strength steel in a Rust Belt state badly in need of job creation.

            <title>Gov&apos;t Tosses Stocks An Anchor  11.08.11</title>
            <description>Economy: Wall Street firms are said to be raking in the money. But don&apos;t tell investors. They&apos;re avoiding big bank and brokerage stocks — along with other industries in which Uncle Sam is involved — like the plague.

In a Sunday story that other liberal media eagerly regurgitated, the Washington Post asserted that &quot;Wall Street&quot; has amassed more profits in the first 2 1/2 years of the Barack Obama presidency than in all eight of George W. Bush&apos;s.

&quot;The largest banks are larger than they were when Obama took office and are nearing the level of profits they were making before the depths of the financial crisis in 2008,&quot; said the Post, citing government data. &quot;Wall Street firms — independent companies and the securities-trading arms of banks — are doing even better.&quot;

            <description>Politics: Not so long ago, a new kind of superpower came into being. It was said to be a model for us all. Now, to put it kindly, the great experiment in &quot;soft power&quot; has hit a rough patch.

For as long as we can remember, a leitmotif of American liberalism has been a certain inferiority complex vis-a-vis the Old World. Western Europe, especially, was just so much cooler — more humane, less warlike, more reasonable. Its power was &quot;soft,&quot; a moral-high-ground thing rather than economic or military might, but strong all the same.

Europe was also a touchstone for our own politics. Much of the progressive agenda in this country could be summed up by the question, &quot;Why can&apos;t we be more like them?&quot;

            <description>Campaign 2011: A fourth woman has come forward to accuse Herman Cain of sexual harassment. Is this a pattern of egregious behavior or a politically motivated attack on a feared political foe? It&apos;s hard to tell.

The charges aired Monday by Sharon Bialek accuse the businessman of taking advantage of her sexually when she sought help from him in finding a job back in 1997.

Though Bialek, who is being &quot;represented,&quot; if that&apos;s the right word, by P.R.-loving feminist attorney Gloria Allred, never filed charges in the matter, she claims to have told at least two people of the incident.

            <title>Media Fails A Sobriety Test On Rick Perry  11.07.11</title>
            <description>Politics: The character assassination of GOP candidates by the MSM continues as CBS casts a jaundiced eye on the Texas governor&apos;s alleged &quot;bizarre&quot; speech in New Hampshire. Perhaps they prefer liberals drunk on power.

When Lincoln appointed Ulysses Grant as general of the Army in March 1864, the selection bypassed more than 200 senior generals. As the story goes, when one of the president&apos;s aides pointed out that he had picked a man who was well known for his alcohol consumption, Lincoln, mindful of Grant&apos;s battlefield accomplishments, is reported to have said, &quot;Find out what brand he drinks and send a barrel to all our other generals.&quot;

We don&apos;t know how much truth there is to the story, which is as much about the motives of Grant&apos;s accusers as it is about winning wars under the influence. We wonder what the real motives are of those who have accused directly or indirectly Texas Gov. Rick Perry of imbibing before an uncharacteristically animated speech at Cornerstone Action&apos;s Annual Fundraising Dinner and Awards Gala in Manchester, N.H.

            <title>White House Has To Answer Solyndra Subpoena  11.07.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: A House committee has subpoenaed the White House&apos;s Solyndra documents. The administration refuses to comply. This isn&apos;t the way things work in a government where each branch keeps the other two honest.

Last Thursday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee asked the White House to turn over documents related to its decision to dole out $535 million in taxpayers&apos; money to Solyndra, the green energy company that has gone bust and been raided by the FBI.

On Friday, the White House, through counsel Kathryn Ruemmler, said no. In a letter to Energy Committee Chairman Fred Upton and Rep. Cliff Stearns, who chairs Energy&apos;s oversight and investigations subcommittee, Ruemmler claimed the request was a &quot;significant intrusion on executive branch interests.&quot;

            <title>Occupy Oakland&apos;s State-Sponsored Riots  11.03.11</title>
            <description>Politics: &quot;Occupy&quot; protest propaganda would have you believe the downtrodden are rising up against the rich. But as Wednesday&apos;s riots in Oakland showed, it&apos;s really the political elites attacking the embattled private sector.

Marching under a huge &quot;Death to Capitalism&quot; banner and egged on by 1960s-era glam-radical Angela Davis, some 7,000 leftists marched on downtown Oakland&apos;s businesses in what they called a &quot;general strike,&quot; trashing cafes, breaking bank windows, and barricading and spraying graffiti at a Whole Foods Market.

Seems local retailers were on the receiving end of this violence — hardly members of the mob&apos;s hated 1%.

Some retailers, such as Men&apos;s Wearhouse, seemed intimidated into closing early, leaving desperate signs in windows declaring they, too, supported the protests.

After that the mob headed over to the Port of Oakland, the nation&apos;s fifth busiest, to shut down commerce. They did so by erecting burning barricades, blocking trucks, and effectively holding drivers hostage. CBS reported that they then hurled chunks of concrete, metal pipes, Roman candles and Molotov cocktails at police.

            <title>Freddie Mac: A Bottomless Pit Of Taxpayer Losses?  11.03.11</title>
            <description>Housing Crisis: Government mortgage company Freddie Mac lost an additional $6 billion in the third quarter and wants Congress to bail it out with taxpayers&apos; money. How about dissolving the failed institution instead?

Freddie Mac is an almost bottomless pit of financial malfeasance. Last year alone it lost $19.8 billion. Taxpayers have so far been drained of as much as $169 billion to save Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, its federal sister that has also been a bust.

Washington estimates they could burn through another $51 billion by the end of 2014.

The anti-capitalists blame Wall Street for the housing meltdown. But Freddie and Fannie are at the heart of the mess. They bought bundles of toxic mortgages from other lenders, which government coerced to make loans to borrowers with shaky credit.

As much as 30% of the loans Freddie and Fannie bought could be regarded as subprime.

The pair was also, Cato Institute analyst Mark Calabria wrote earlier this year, &quot;the largest single investor in subprime private label mortgage-backed securities.

&quot;During the height of the housing bubble, almost 40% of newly issued private-label subprime securities were purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.&quot;

            <title>Keystone Pipeline Delay Puts Energy Future On Hold  11.03.11</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: The president who often lets policy decisions be driven by others now says the pipeline to bring Canada&apos;s tar sands oil to America is his decision to make. So make it already, Mr. President.

The administration&apos;s industrial policy of picking winners and losers, particularly in the energy sector, has given us such white, or should we say green, elephants as the bankrupt solar panel manufacturer Solyndra. It has an opportunity to pick a real winner — the Keystone XL pipeline to bring oil from Canada&apos;s rich tar sands to the American market.

So far the administration has given lip service to the project, with final approval seemingly in the hands of the State Department, since the pipeline crosses an international border. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney seemingly reaffirmed this by stating, &quot;This is a decision that will be made by the State Department.&quot;

But President Obama seemed to indicate Carney didn&apos;t get the memo when he indicated in an interview with Omaha, Neb., television station KETV that the State Department would send him a report in a few months and that he would make the final decision.

&quot;There&apos;s a way of doing that and making sure the health and safety of the people of Nebraska are protected. And that&apos;s how I&apos;ll be measuring these recommendations when they come to me,&quot; Obama said.

            <title>ObamaCare&apos;s Billions In Hidden Pork For Unions  11.03.11</title>
            <description>Health Reform: How do you funnel billions of dollars to your union pals at a time when the government is running record deficits? Easy, you just tuck the money into ObamaCare.

According to a new Government Accountability Office report, the federal government has so far handed out $2.7 billion out of a $5 billion program squirreled away in ObamaCare.

The Early Retiree Reinsurance Program is advertized as a way to &quot;stabilize the availability of employer-sponsored coverage for early retirees,&quot; according to a Health and Human Services memo.

The argument goes that companies are increasingly dropping retiree health benefits, leaving those who retire before becoming eligible for Medicare in a jam — either they face exorbitant rates for insurance or expose themselves to potentially catastrophic health costs.

The little-noticed ObamaCare program was supposed to encourage companies to continue offering this benefit until 2014 — when ObamaCare fully kicks in and will solve everything — by reimbursing companies for a chunk of their retiree health costs.

            <title>Is Greece The Lindsay Lohan Of Debtors?  11.02.11</title>
            <description>Moral Hazard: By calling for a referendum on the European Union&apos;s bailout, Greece has essentially spit in the face of the very people trying to save it. It may be time to let Greece default and go its own way.

The EU, at its own peril, keeps trying to help Greece, but Greece will have none of it. Neither its politicians nor its people seem to fully understand their fiscal predicament.

The choice is stark: Under the $178 billion EU bailout deal, Greece can cut its deficits and debt over the next 10 years. If it refuses, it&apos;ll be cut off by the IMF and EU, and private lenders will abandon it, leading to a collapse of the country&apos;s economy. It&apos;s that simple.

            <description>Public Sector: When bailed-out private Wall Street banks handed out bonuses last year, the president threw a fit. So why is he ignoring the huge executive bonuses at government-owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?

Shortly after taking office, President Obama reacted to Wall Street bonuses handed out in January 2009 with incredibly harsh language, calling them &quot;shameful&quot; and &quot;the height of irresponsibility.&quot;

&quot;Folks on Wall Street who are asking for help need to show some restraint and show some discipline and show some sense of responsibility,&quot; he said. A few months later, Obama pledged that there would be &quot;no more bonuses for companies that taxpayers are helping out,&quot; calling them a violation of &quot;our fundamental values.&quot;

            <description>Taxes: Colorado voters have closed their wallets and told their state government to learn how to live within its means. It&apos;s a message that Washington should heed as well.

When a swing state speaks, smart politicians listen. Colorado is one such state — it&apos;s crucial to both parties in 2012 — and it sent a clear signal this week on the subject of taxes: No more.

By 63.5% to 36.4%, voters on Tuesday routed an initiative that would have raised sales and income taxes for five years to provide $2.9 billion for schools and colleges. That&apos;s a resounding defeat. What makes it especially significant is the tax hike was intended for education — typically the last thing that voters want to see cut. Even sacred cows are being put on short rations these days.

            <title>7 Billion Is Overpopulated? It&apos;s Just A Start   11.02.11</title>
            <description>Human Capital: Earth now has 7 billion people. Are we overcrowded? About to outstrip our resources? Should we prepare for the catastrophic population bomb we&apos;ve been warned about? No, no and no.

In 1968, a Stanford biologist named Paul R. Ehrlich wrote &quot;The Population Bomb,&quot; an unnecessary alarmist book that warned of famines in the 1970s and 1980s due to overpopulation.

Ehrlich, still honored and respected for reasons we don&apos;t understand, likened humans to a cancer that must be cut out using &quot;brutal and heartless decisions.&quot;

            <title>Say No To Supertaxes   11.01.11</title>
            <description>Economic Policy: The mainstream media&apos;s caricature of the bipartisan budget &quot;supercommittee&quot; is that its Democratic members have gone overboard with concessions. In fact, Republicans can smell the snake oil.

Whenever Washington sets up a &quot;blue ribbon commission,&quot; hold on to your wallet. This time, however, the game may not work, because Republicans in Washington know what happens when they betray their anti-tax principles.

Supercommittee Democrats recently offered to trim up to $3 trillion over a decade from entitlement programs like Medicare if their GOP counterparts would agree to $1.3 trillion in tax hikes. That includes a rumored capital gains tax rate increase on some investors.

            <description>Boondoggle Watch: A new business plan puts the cost of California&apos;s planned bullet train at nearly $100 billion. And air travel will still be three times faster. Time to stop this train before it leaves the station.

When President Obama talks about how Americans (so he says) have &quot;lost our ambition&quot; to do great things like building the Golden Gate Bridge, we think he may have high-speed rail in mind.

He has been talking up fast trains and pushing Congress to fund them ever since he took office. JFK had the space program. Obama has choo-choos. How far we&apos;ve come

            <title>Draining Banks Is A Fool&apos;s Errand   11.01.11</title>
            <description>Banks: Using the Guy Fawkes mask emblem of Occupy Wall Street and the &quot;Anonymous&quot; hacker group, leftists are planning a big Nov. 5 to-do to pull their money from big banks and put it into small banks. It&apos;s economic idiocy.

Led by the likes of MoveOn.org, Arianna Huffington and a supposed Los Angeles art gallery owner named Kristen Christian, the leftist game of &quot;blame the banks&quot; for the acts of Democratic politicians is coming together Friday — Guy Fawkes Day in England — in an extravaganza of events alternately titled &quot;Bank Transfer Day,&quot; &quot;Move Your Money&quot; day and &quot;Make Wall Street Pay.&quot;

These Facebook-based groups have drawn tens of thousands of &quot;fans,&quot; with thousands &quot;pledging&quot; to close their accounts at banks with more than $65 billion in assets — Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank, Chase Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — and take them to credit unions and community banks.

            <description>Policy Errors: The ex-House Speaker who promised millions of jobs from ObamaCare says that not creating jobs is better than creating nonunion jobs. But then she also believes unemployment checks grow the economy.

The Peter Principle applies to politics, and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi should be its poster child, having risen to the level of her incompetence. Her latest pearl of wisdom came in an interview with CNBC in which she said if you can&apos;t be a union worker you should be unemployed.

&quot;Do you think it&apos;s right that Boeing has to close down that plant in South Carolina because it&apos;s nonunion?&quot; asked host Maria Bartiromo.

Little noticed in the protest army sitting in against Wall Street, the educational establishment is more involved than you might think.

From teachers disrupting school board meetings to classroom use of lesson plans about the &quot;Occupy&quot; protests to &quot;teach-ins&quot; that aim to educate the public about protest demands, we are witnessing a vast spread of economic illiteracy for political purposes.

In a case reminiscent of an earlier injustice against those protecting our borders, Border Patrol Agent

Jesus E. &quot;Chito&quot; Diaz Jr. has been sentenced to two years in prison by U.S. District Judge Alia Moses Ludlum in San Antonio. The illegal alien he arrested for drug smuggling goes free.

            <description>Media: Does the Washington Post ever consult a dictionary? In what looks like an effort to lasso Republican Sen. Marco Rubio&apos;s rising star, they&apos;ve built a shoddy two-story attack on a faulty definition of &quot;exile.&quot;

It started Oct. 20 when, on the front page, the Post headlined, &quot;Marco Rubio&apos;s compelling family story embellishes facts, documents show.&quot; The hit piece, by Manuel Roig-Franzia, cited Rubio&apos;s repeated self-reference as the &quot;son of exiles,&quot; saving the &quot;Gotcha!&quot; for the second paragraph:

&quot;The documents show that Rubio&apos;s parents came to the United States and were admitted for permanent residence more than two-and-a-half years before Castro&apos;s forces overthrew the Cuban government and took power on New Year&apos;s Day 1959.&quot;

            <title>Caving On ObamaCare   10.28.11</title>
            <description>Reform: Remember when Nancy Pelosi promised that Americans would fall in love with ObamaCare once it was the law of the land? Turns out barely half of Democrats now like it.

The Kaiser Family Foundation has tracked public support for ObamaCare since the law was passed. It&apos;s never been very popular, but now support has hit a new low of 34% due in part to erosion in Obama&apos;s own party. The month ObamaCare passed, more than three of four Democrats approved of it. Now, just over half do, and only one in five has a &quot;very favorable&quot; view. Even worse, just 27% of Democrats think the law will make them and their families better off.

But how can this be, loyalists ask, when ObamaCare is already helping people? Just ask any &quot;adult child&quot; on his parents&apos; health plan, or all those small businesses benefiting from the insurance premium tax credit?

            <title>Supercommittee Isn&apos;t Making Super Cuts In The Deficit    10.28.11</title>
            <description>Budget: Given all the hoopla, you&apos;d think the deficit Supercommittee was hacking away at the size of government without mercy. In fact, even the $1.2 trillion in hoped-for cuts will do nothing to attack our long-term deficits.

Sometimes it&apos;s worse to pretend to be doing something about a serious problem than it is to do nothing at all. That&apos;s where we are in our talks about our out-of-control spending.

Just as the European Union did, we&apos;re going through two months of talks about what to do about long-term fiscal imbalances. Under the deal that kept the government from shutting down last summer, the so-called supercommittee was supposed to take politics out of the equation by making talks truly &quot;bipartisan.&quot;

            <title>Holder&apos;s &apos;Right To Lie&apos;    10.27.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: A Department of Justice withholding Fast and Furious gun-running information from Congress proposes shredding the Freedom of Information Act by being able to deny certain documents even exist.

The most transparent administration in history has struck another blow for opaqueness with a proposed new federal regulation expanding its ability to respond to Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, as the new rule states, &quot;as if the excluded documents did not exist.&quot;

Current provisions that allow for denying access to documents are found in 5 U.S.C. section 552(c) and were enacted in 1986. Government can deny document access if the FOIA requester is under criminal investigation and the investigation would be jeopardized, when the request concern&apos;s an informant whose identity is otherwise not known, or when the request seeks records &quot;pertaining to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism, and the existence of the records is classified information.&quot;

            <title>EU&apos;s Debt Deal Doesn&apos;t End The Crisis   10.27.11</title>
            <description>Crisis: The European Union&apos;s deal to halve Greece&apos;s debt and double its own bailout fund to $1.4 trillion is being hailed as the salvation of Europe&apos;s economy and the euro. In fact, they&apos;ve just kicked the can down the road.

We hate to sound a gloomy note as stocks and the euro rally across Europe and the U.S., but the stubborn fact is the 50% &quot;haircut&quot; Greek bond investors will take is entirely &quot;voluntary.&quot; So really, unless they want desperately to dump their debt, they don&apos;t have to.

As has been pointed out, a 50% reduction still leaves Greece&apos;s debt at 120% of GDP — a level most analysts believe to be economically ruinous. And the $1.4 trillion bailout fund sounds big until you realize EU officials and private-sector economists say a lot more is needed.

            <title>Better Man Won   10.27.11</title>
            <description>Lawsuit Abuse: A congressman voted out of office last year is suing, claiming that the election loss cost him his livelihood. There are so many things wrong here that we almost don&apos;t know where to begin.

Former Rep. Steve Driehaus lost Ohio&apos;s 1st congressional district race in 2010. He was thrown out by the voters after serving a single term.

But rather than showing some class and proving he is a man of character, he&apos;s suing the Susan B. Anthony List because it identified him as a member who voted against its pro-life principles. He claims that the group is responsible for &quot;depriving a person of his livelihood.&quot;

            <title>Message From The 53%: Get A Job  10.27.11</title>
            <description>Protests: The unhappy campers of Occupy Wall Street clearly have time on their hands. Some taxpayers have gone online with some advice for using that time more productively.

Pardon us for promoting a stereotype, but the OWS protesters we see on TV tend to look mostly young and able-bodied.

A little logic suggests that they are not among the struggling Americans working two or three jobs to keep a roof over their heads and feed their children. Those people are too busy to camp out in public parks.

Sooner or later, someone has to start calling them on their inconsistent behavior. They claim to speak for 99% of Americans, including most who work or are looking for work. But they&apos;re not walking that talk.

            <description>Nuclear Terrorism: With the U.N. atomic agency expected to provide new evidence that Iran is pursuing a nuclear arsenal, some are ignoring the terrible reality. Unfortunately, atomic jihad cannot be wished away.

On Monday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi boasted, &quot;Today we have thousands of nuclear scientists. There is almost nothing beyond our reach in the nuclear field if we aim for it.&quot;

But according to Fareed Zakaria, who appears today in our &quot;On The Left&quot; column, talk coupled with diplomatic pressure can &quot;bring Iran in from the cold.&quot; Zakaria reminds us that &quot;all Iranian officials repeat constantly that they would never develop nuclear weapons.&quot;

            <description>Journalism: Some recent surveys claim Americans are more supportive of the Occupy Wall Street crowd than the Tea Party. What they really show is how extreme media bias can warp public opinion.

The Pew Research Center/Washington Post survey out Monday finds that 39% support the Occupy Wall Street movement, compared with 32% for the Tea Party.

A Time magazine survey earlier this month found 54% had a favorable opinion of OWS, compared with just 27% for the Tea Party. An AP survey showed 37% backed the OWS, while just 28% supported the Tea Party.

            <description>Homeland Security: The bleaching of Islam from the terror picture is almost complete. Eric Holder has ordered a purge of FBI training manuals. Soon the 9/11 hijackers&apos; religion will be censored, too.

Last week, top Justice Department officials huddled with several Islamic groups — including a Muslim Brotherhood front implicated in a terror-finance scheme — to discuss &quot;post-9/11 discrimination.&quot; They promised the aggrieved they&apos;d pull back references to Islam from terror-training materials.

&quot;I recently directed all components of the Department of Justice to re-evaluate their training efforts,&quot; Deputy Attorney General James Cole announced during the Washington conference. U.S. Attorney Dwight Holton explained that FBI training materials that even remotely link Islam to violence will be banned.

Last week, top Justice Department officials huddled with several Islamic groups — including a Muslim Brotherhood front implicated in a terror-finance scheme — to discuss &quot;post-9/11 discrimination.&quot; They promised the aggrieved they&apos;d pull back references to Islam from terror-training materials.

&quot;I recently directed all components of the Department of Justice to re-evaluate their training efforts,&quot; Deputy Attorney General James Cole announced during the Washington conference. U.S. Attorney Dwight Holton explained that FBI training materials that even remotely link Islam to violence will be banned.</itunes:summary>

            <title>President Obama&apos;s Blame-Americans-First Tour  10.26.11</title>
            <description>Economy: Having run out of excuses for the economic crisis his own policies have produced, President Obama has taken to blaming the American people. Has he no shame?

At a San Francisco fundraiser this week, Obama told the assembled fat cats that: &quot;We have lost our ambition, our imagination, and our willingness to do the things that built the Golden Gate Bridge.&quot;

Earlier this month, Obama complained that &quot;we used to have the best stuff. Think about it: The world used to say &apos;Let&apos;s travel to America. Let&apos;s see the Golden Gate Bridge. Let&apos;s see the Hoover Dam. Let&apos;s see the amazing things that America built.&apos;&quot;

            <title>Is Student-Loan Forgiveness Obama&apos;s Next Crisis?  10.26.11</title>
            <description>Government: President Obama wants student loans to be more like student handouts. Too bad he hasn&apos;t learned one of the lessons of the 2008 mortgage crisis: Free money costs plenty.

The global financial crisis has its roots in the U.S. government&apos;s politicization of mortgages. Washington decided that all those real-life versions of mean old bank president Mr. Potter from &quot;It&apos;s a Wonderful Life&quot; shouldn&apos;t just turn into big-hearted Jimmy Stewarts.

No, they should practically become welfare officers, doling out money to people with bad credit ratings to buy homes, without requiring a down payment.

            <title>Bold Colors And (Mitt&apos;s) Pale Pastels  10.25.11</title>
            <description>Fiscal Policy: This is a time for big ideas that take some political risk. Rick Perry&apos;s flat-tax solution largely fits that bill, and so do the proposals from most others in the GOP field. Then there&apos;s Romney.

Perry this week finally unveiled the sort of detailed economic plan that, in a well-planned campaign, he would&apos;ve had ready a couple of months ago. So it may be too late to help him much. But it&apos;s never too late to inject good ideas into the political mix. Perry&apos;s plan isn&apos;t perfect, but it would be a huge improvement over the laws in place now.

Perry is taking some political risk in the service of sound policy. It&apos;s not that his 20% flat tax would be unpopular with Republican primary voters. But if he got the party&apos;s nomination, Democrats and most of the media would pounce on the fact that his plan lowers taxes for the rich.

            <title>California&apos;s Economic Suicide  10.25.11</title>
            <description>The Weather: Regulations finalized by the California Air Resources Board establish the nation&apos;s first state-run cap-and-trade regime. Despite Solyndra, the state will gather solar panels while it may.

The 262 pages of regulations implementing California&apos;s 2006 global warming legislation, Assembly Bill 32, approved by CARB last Thursday, will probably reduce employment more than it reduces emissions. The only thing it will cap is economic growth by bleeding a patient that is already hemorrhaging red ink.

Signed into law in 2006 by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the cap-and-trade regulations are intended to force California to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.

Thailand is a longtime U.S. treaty ally that has developed its economy over the last decades through trade, not aid.

It&apos;s now got big trouble with the worst flooding in centuries. So far, 366 are dead, and a third of the nation is underwater.

Imagine the U.S. and the other Allied powers allowing the remnants of the Nazi party to help run a post-World War II West Germany. That, in effect, is our policy in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

Last week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared that &quot;there has to be outreach to see whether or not there is an opportunity for resolution with some parts of the Taliban, or with all of the Taliban.&quot;

In 2009, the U.S. was ranked No. 6. It was fourth in 2008 and third in 2007.

            <description>Europe: Despite weeks of talks, European leaders still don&apos;t know how to end the financial crisis that threatens to drag down their economies. But one thing they do know: Whatever happens, it will mean more government.

Leaders of the 27 European Union members meet Wednesday in an effort to halt the growing financial crisis that threatens to engulf Europe and the rest of the developed world. They have a lot on their plate.

Faced with demonstrations and even riots in Athens, the EU must restructure Greece&apos;s $240 billion debt to keep it from defaulting. Worse, Spain ($1.2 trillion in debt), Italy ($1.1 trillion), Ireland ($867 billion) and even Portugal ($286 billion) have even larger debt problems and are close to default.

            <description>Journalism: Is the New York Times a news organization or a front for left-wing activists? Reporter Natasha Lennard was filmed leading an Occupy Wall Street panel, offering radicals tips on keeping their identities secret. Openly.

In a video that appeared on BigGovernment.com, Lennard, a Times freelance reporter who was arrested with 700 other leftists for shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge this month, revealed herself to be within the actual leadership of the Occupy Wall Street protest movement.

Along with four other &quot;comrades,&quot; she addressed a roomful of people at a bookstore in Manhattan, officiously advising the fractious movement on how to win.

            <itunes:summary>Journalism: Is the New York Times a news organization or a front for left-wing activists? Reporter Natasha Lennard was filmed leading an Occupy Wall Street panel, offering radicals tips on keeping their identities secret. Openly.

In a video that appeared on BigGovernment.com, Lennard, a Times freelance reporter who was arrested with 700 other leftists for shutting down the Brooklyn Bridge this month, revealed herself to be within the actual leadership of the Occupy Wall Street protest movement.

Along with four other &quot;comrades,&quot; she addressed a roomful of people at a bookstore in Manhattan, officiously advising the fractious movement on how to win.</itunes:summary>

            <title>In Mideast, U.S. Policy Is In Shambles  10.24.11</title>
            <description>Diplomacy: As the U.S. careens from debacle to debacle, our policy in the Middle East is now in disarray. American influence is waning, as radical Islamists take over in nation after nation. The damage may be irreversible.

Arab Spring has given way to Arab Fall, and things aren&apos;t going well. Not only is Israel, our best friend and only true ally in the region, under siege by its Arab neighbors, but we seem to be walking away from the problem.

Meanwhile, in country after country, those who hate the West in general and the U.S. in particular are making great strides. Increasingly, Iran seems to be the victor. It has long sought to replace the U.S. as the area&apos;s dominant influence. Now its hand has been strengthened by the feckless and self-defeating diplomacy carried out by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and, of course, President Obama.

            <description>Meltdown: The president&apos;s barren jobs program has also forced him to go back to the drawing board on his mortgage program. His latest anti-foreclosure tonic merely doubles-down on failure.

Stubbornly high unemployment has made it harder for people to pay their mortgages, adding to the already record number of foreclosures plaguing the economy. The housing overhang, coupled with weak demand, has depressed home values further.

And now even more borrowers owe more on their mortgage than their home is worth.

            <title>Politicizing Our Exit From Iraq  10.21.11</title>
            <description>Iraq: President Obama claims his total troop withdrawal by year-end was always the plan. In fact, thousands of our military would be staying longer, training Iraqis, but for the administration&apos;s diplomatic incompetence.

After announcing Friday a total withdrawal of troops by the end of this year, Obama reminded Iraq that &quot;as a candidate for president, I pledged to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end for the sake of our national security and to strengthen American leadership around the world.&quot;

But this is no responsible end to the Iraq War. It&apos;s the beginning of the consequences of America relinquishing its responsibilities in a place that became, as both George W. Bush and current CIA director and former commander of U.S. forces in Iraq David Petraeus put it, &quot;the central front&quot; in the global war being waged by al-Qaida and other Islamist terrorist groups.

Even a liberal like Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., was &quot;prepared to support a continued presence of U.S. trainers in Iraq beyond the end of this year&quot; — which, utilizing thousands of U.S. troops, was the White House&apos;s preferred plan.

            <title>Biden&apos;s Criminal Lies  10.21.11</title>
            <description>Stimulus: Vice President Joe Biden&apos;s challenge to the GOP that blocking the jobs bill would mean more rapes and murders is beneath even the remarkably low standard he&apos;s set for that office. His claim is also utterly bogus.

Talk about desperation. In trying to sell President Obama&apos;s latest jobs bill, Biden claimed more people would be murdered and raped if it failed to pass, because states would have to lay off cops.

Without the $35 billion in new federal grants to states, he said, &quot;murder will continue to rise, rape will continue to rise, all crimes will continue to rise.

&quot;I wish they,&quot; meaning Republicans, &quot;had some notion what it&apos;s like to be on the other side of a gun. Or (to have) a 200-pound man standing over you telling you to submit,&quot; he also said this week.

Instead of walking Biden&apos;s comments back, the White House rose to his defense. &quot;I think everyone will agree with the equation that fewer police officers on the street has a direct effect on the crime rate,&quot; press secretary Jay Carney said. &quot;That is the point that the president absolutely shares.&quot;

            <title>Green Energy&apos;s Bad Karma  10.21.11</title>
            <description>Boondoggles: With the administration&apos;s approval, the recipient of another half-billion-dollar loan to build electric cars is outsourcing the work and any jobs that might be created or saved to Finland.

The Fisker Karma electric car, heralded two years ago by Vice President Joe Biden as the future of the American auto industry, may prove to be another administration &quot;bad bet,&quot; just as President Obama called Solyndra, heralded by Biden as the future of American energy.

&quot;Folks, we&apos;re making a bet,&quot; Biden said Oct. 27, 2009, using a familiar administration metaphor. &quot;We&apos;re making a bet on the future, we&apos;re making a bet on the American people, we&apos;re making a bet on the market, we&apos;re making a bet on innovation.&quot;

We&apos;ve lost this bet too, it seems, since Fisker will be creating jobs in Finland paid for with American tax dollars.

The plan was for Fisker Automotive, backed by California venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers, whose partners include former Vice President Al Gore, the jolly green profiteer, to build electric sports sedans at the shuttered GM factory it bought in Delaware.

Instead, it&apos;ll be built using a $529 million taxpayer loan by 500 workers at a rural Finnish firm, Valmet Automotive.

The excuse given for the move was that Fisker Karma didn&apos;t want to be another Solyndra, though the car it builds may wind up being another Chevy Volt, an overpriced and overhyped vehicle built not to satisfy consumer demands, but rather government mandates.

            <description>Civility: The Occupy Wall Street protests, now in their fifth week, have drawn comment for their economically illiterate agenda and leftist sponsorship. But their loutish behavior is notable, too. Did the Tea Parties ever act like that?

As Vice President Joe Biden warns of rapes and murders, he might want to take a look first at what&apos;s going on at the Occupy Wall Street protests the Obama administration so heartily endorses.

Crime is a defining feature of tenting hundreds of people together, while the protesters themselves have proven to be poster children for trash, unemployability and lawlessness. Take the protests in New York.

• Setting the tone in September, protesters — frustrated by the lack of media attention to their original &quot;Days of Rage&quot; protests — got attention by blocking traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge and keeping citizens from getting home. They drew 700 arrests there and, days later, another 70 arrests in Times Square.

            <description>Leadership: The president makes an odious comparison between the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, unable to tell the difference between those who work to change the system and those who would destroy it.

If you ask President Obama, the angry mobs (to coin a phrase) of Occupy Wall Street (OWS), members of which when not relieving themselves on the hoods of New York taxis offer no coherent explanation of their purpose and agenda, are merely the Tea Party of the left.

On Tuesday, he told ABC&apos;s Jake Tapper he understood &quot;the frustrations being expressed in those protests&quot; on Wall Street, noting that &quot;in some ways, they&apos;re not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the Tea Party.&quot; Excuse us, but there&apos;s a world of difference.

            <title>Wall Street Did It?.     10.20.11</title>
            <description>Meltdown: If Republicans are to take back the White House and Senate, they need to do a better job tying Democrats and Washington to the subprime crisis. It&apos;s not hard, yet even their front-runner struggles to make the case.

On Wednesday night, CNN host Piers Morgan guilted Cain into allowing that banks were, as Morgan put it, &quot;effectively preying on the most vulnerable elements of American society,&quot; and that Wall Street deserves at least partial blame for the crisis and should be held to account. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t defend the banks,&quot; Cain said, &quot;because I happen to think that the banks are part of the problem. Wall Street is.&quot;

Cain belatedly also faulted Fannie and Freddie, and the Democrats in Washington who protected them. Piers then pressed him to come up with a pie chart alloting blame — Washington vs. Wall Street—and Cain assigned neither a majority responsibility for the mess.

            <itunes:summary>Meltdown: If Republicans are to take back the White House and Senate, they need to do a better job tying Democrats and Washington to the subprime crisis. It&apos;s not hard, yet even their front-runner struggles to make the case.

            <title>Bringing A Flat Tax To The Table.     10.20.11</title>
            <description>Tax Reform: His campaign flagging, GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry is about to unveil what he hopes will be a game-changer: a flat tax. Whether it works for him or not, we&apos;re glad to see this bold idea part of the mix.

We like Herman Cain a lot. But his 9-9-9 tax plan, not so much. Perry, no doubt trying to recoup some of his lost support, will unveil a flat tax proposal on Tuesday as a counter-salvo to Cain&apos;s popular idea. Count us among the intrigued.

Sure, as the cliche goes, the devil is in the details. We don&apos;t know the particulars of his plan, and we&apos;ll reserve specific judgment as a result. That said, the idea of introducing a much flatter, much fairer tax code is one that can no longer be avoided. And the flatter, the better.

            <title>But Seriously ...     10.20.11</title>
            <description>Protest And Politicians: Left-leaning local officials have embraced the Occupy (Your Town Here) movement. But their taxpaying constituents may soon start having other ideas.

The story of Occupy Wall Street and its spinoffs continues to evolve, and not to the movement&apos;s benefit. The notion that this is some spontaneous cry for help from America&apos;s economic victims can&apos;t stand up to reality. The closer you look, the more you see just a law-enforcement problem: illegal camping on public property.

We predict that, before long, public sympathy for the protesters will turn to serious concerns about sanitation. People will want their parks back. They&apos;ll also realize that these camp-outs are not cost-free.

            <description>U.S. Interests: Dictator Moammar Gadhafi finally met his bloody end at a rathole Thursday, and Libyan crowds celebrated. President Obama praised the rebels, proclaiming: &quot;You have won your revolution.&quot; Not so fast.

If there is one thing that we ought to know by now, it&apos;s that getting rid of a dictator like Gadhafi is the easy part. Gadhafi was a monster, but a known quality. What&apos;s hard is ensuring that what comes after isn&apos;t worse.

The cheers heard as Gadhafi&apos;s body was dragged through the streets are mere echoes of those that followed the downfall of the Shah of Iran in 1979 and, more ominously, the ouster of Hosni Mubarak in Egypt this past spring.

            <title>Dems Get It Exactly Wrong On Jobs      10.19.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid thinks the private sector is &quot;doing just fine&quot; and that it&apos;s government that needs help. Now we see what the Democrats&apos; priority is: big government, not people.

Responding Wednesday from the Senate floor to a question about a new Democrat plan to raise taxes on working Americans to pay for another $35 billion bailout for the states and public employee unions, Reid said:

&quot;It&apos;s very clear that private-sector jobs have been doing just fine; it&apos;s the public-sector jobs where we&apos;ve lost huge numbers, and that&apos;s what this legislation is all about.&quot;

No, we&apos;re not making this up. The comment is utterly wrong, of course, and underscores Democrats&apos; cluelessness and insensitivity to the damage they&apos;ve inflicted on the private economy since taking power in 2006.

Government data — available on the Web to all, including Reid — show 6.257 million private-sector jobs lost since the recession began in December 2007. That&apos;s a 5.4% decline. By comparison, government employment at all levels — state, local and federal — over that same period has fallen by about 392,000, or just 1.75%. If you look just at Reid&apos;s employer, the federal government, the number of jobs actually increased by 63,000 since 2007 — a 2.29% gain.

So who&apos;s suffering here?

Overall, the private sector has lost 16 jobs for every job lost in government since 2007. Even if you correct for the relative difference in the size of the two job markets (see chart above), the private sector has still lost three times more jobs than the public sector.

Is this surprising? It shouldn&apos;t be. The federal government&apos;s $840 billion stimulus effort was almost entirely aimed at bolstering government, and bailing out industries and unions that support Democrats.

            <title>Cordray Can Wait  10.19.11</title>
            <description>Regulation: The president is sore Republicans are blocking his nod to head his bank watchdog agency. Let him stew. The powerful post is ripe for abuse and screams for opposition.

Richard Cordray is the man on the hot seat. Obama tapped him to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, set up by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul to check bank &quot;abuses.&quot;

As Ohio&apos;s attorney general, Cordray&apos;s main focus was making Wall Street pay for the financial crisis. He sued BofA, AIG, Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s, Moody&apos;s and other Wall Street firms on behalf of public-employee pensions. His shakedown netted trial lawyers and the unions they represent for more than $1 billion in settlements and fees.

Most concerning, this wannabe federal bank sheriff is in the back pocket of trial lawyers. The law firm that represented Ohio in the AIG case pumped $125,000 into Cordray&apos;s campaigns. Other firms donated $200,000 to Cordray, who plans to run for Ohio governor one day.

The new bureau will spawn more work for trial lawyers as it investigates banks for loosely defined &quot;abusive&quot; practices, including loan price &quot;discrimination.&quot;

            <title>Chavez&apos;s Dirtiest Trick Yet  10.19.11</title>
            <description>Elections: If there&apos;s any better proof that Venezuela&apos;s Hugo Chavez can&apos;t win an election fairly, it&apos;s in his Supreme Court&apos;s sorry bid to disqualify a promising opponent this week.

Why anyone would want to run for president in a democracy as corrupt as Venezuela&apos;s is an open question. After all, President Hugo Chavez&apos;s Marxist government has used state funds to buy votes, engaged in ballot-box fraud (as gullible observers like Jimmy Carter grinned and nodded), and used surveillance and retaliation against those who voted &quot;incorrectly&quot; in supposedly secret elections.

But it speaks well for those who do, keeping the faith for democracy against the odds.

Maybe that&apos;s why the government of Hugo Chavez&apos;s Venezuela has come up with its lowest blow yet: disqualifying a popular candidate to knock him out without a vote.

The candidate, Leopoldo Lopez, is a former mayor of the Caracas district of Chacao who kept the streets clean, enforced the law, and kept taxes low even as the rest of the city morphed into a red-shirted, graffiti-strewn Chavista cesspool of garbage, crime and corruption.

Of course he&apos;s popular.

But this week, the Venezuelan Supreme Court defied a September Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruling that held Lopez should not be banned from running for president due to politically motivated charges of corruption in 2005 that never went to court. Venezuela&apos;s constitution requires abiding by any IACHR ruling, so it should have been an open-and-shut case,

            <title>Ron Paul&apos;s Really Good Idea   10.19.11</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: The isolationism of Ron Paul hurts his chances to be seriously considered for the presidency. But on cutting domestic spending he outshines his rivals. No wonder the media won&apos;t take him seriously.

&apos;I want to hear somebody up here willing to cut something, something real,&quot; the Texas congressman, obstetrician and three-time presidential candidate said during Tuesday evening&apos;s Republican debate in Las Vegas.

Paul and his ideas for real, deep cuts and eliminations of entire cabinet agencies are being blacked out by the establishment media in America.

This &quot;Libertarian That Dare Not Speak Its Name&quot; gets the least coverage overall of any presidential candidate according to a new Pew poll released this week; Paul has been the subject of only 2% of the campaign news stories conducted.

And yet Paul is the only one with concrete plans to shrink government, as opposed to the spending hawk image the other GOP candidates present to the party grass roots and to the Tea Party.

Paul proposes cutting $1 trillion within a year, including closing down five Cabinet agencies, the departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development and the Interior, and reducing most other federal spending to 2006 levels.

            <itunes:summary>Election &apos;12: The isolationism of Ron Paul hurts his chances to be seriously considered for the presidency. But on cutting domestic spending he outshines his rivals. No wonder the media won&apos;t take him seriously.

&apos;I want to hear somebody up here willing to cut something, something real,&quot; the Texas congressman, obstetrician and three-time presidential candidate said during Tuesday evening&apos;s Republican debate in Las Vegas.

Paul and his ideas for real, deep cuts and eliminations of entire cabinet agencies are being blacked out by the establishment media in America.

This &quot;Libertarian That Dare Not Speak Its Name&quot; gets the least coverage overall of any presidential candidate according to a new Pew poll released this week; Paul has been the subject of only 2% of the campaign news stories conducted.

And yet Paul is the only one with concrete plans to shrink government, as opposed to the spending hawk image the other GOP candidates present to the party grass roots and to the Tea Party.

Paul proposes cutting $1 trillion within a year, including closing down five Cabinet agencies, the departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Housing and Urban Development and the Interior, and reducing most other federal spending to 2006 levels.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Krugman&apos;s Not-So-Excellent Adventure   10.19.11</title>
            <description>Keynesianism: A Page 1 article Monday about the &quot;Myth Of Austerity&quot; got harsh reactions from two liberal economists. But in trashing IBD, they exposed the weakness of their claim that more spending will grow the economy.

The IBD article pointed out that, despite the hue and cry over government spending cuts — including claims by Republicans that they&apos;d enacted $38 billion in cuts for fiscal year 2011 — federal spending has actually increased by nearly 5% in the first nine months of this year.

It went on to point out that liberal economists such as Jared Bernstein and Paul Krugman had nevertheless been gnashing their teeth about how spending cuts were dragging down the economy.

Here&apos;s Bernstein: &quot;Government spending cutbacks have been a large drag on growth in recent quarters and have led to sharp losses in state and local employment.&quot;

And here&apos;s Krugman in a New York Times Op-Ed from a few weeks ago: &quot;In Europe, troubled nations like Greece and Ireland have imposed savage cuts, even as stronger nations have imposed milder austerity programs of their own. In the United States, the modest federal stimulus of 2009 has faded out, while state and local governments have slashed their budgets, so that over all we&apos;ve had a de facto move toward austerity not so different from Europe&apos;s.&quot;

So, now that we know spending actually has continued to climb at both the federal and state level, these two esteemed liberals say: No, no, no! You don&apos;t understand! The real problem, you see, is spending isn&apos;t going up fast enough!

            <description>Budget: Over the weekend, Senate Democrats passed a dubious milestone — going 900 days without fulfilling their legal obligation to pass a budget. Worse is the fact that this gross dereliction of duty has gone largely unnoticed.

You have to go all the way back to April 29, 2009 — just three months after President Obama took the oath of office — to find the last time Senate Democrats managed to discharge their legal obligation to produce a budget plan.

That&apos;s right — legal obligation. It says right in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that the Senate must produce a budget resolution by April of each year.

            <title>Cuba&apos;s Lady Of Valor    10.18.11</title>
            <description>Freedom: Laura Pollan Toledo was a humble schoolteacher who led Cuba&apos;s defiant Ladies in White. She died Friday in Havana. But she left a legacy of untold courage that terrified Cuba&apos;s long-communist dictatorship.

As surely as the sun will rise, a day will come when Cuba is free of its 52-year Marxist nightmare. And when its history is written, it&apos;s likely to begin with the story of Laura Pollan Toledo, the wife of an arrested dissident who shined a light on the totalitarian nature of the regime for all the world to see.

Pollan was a founder of the Ladies in White, the noted group of dissidents&apos; wives who silently walked in procession, wearing white and carrying gladiolus flowers. They attended Mass together at St. Rita&apos;s Church to pray for their husbands&apos; return.

            <description>Social Justice: The former national security adviser wants to compile a list of the evil rich who don&apos;t spend their money as the left wants. It comes with the ultimate threat: We know where you live.

Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser to America&apos;s worst ex-president, Jimmy Carter, has something for the angry mobs of Occupy Wall Street (OWS) to do once they&apos;re done trashing New York City&apos;s environment and demanding that those who, as Jefferson Starship sang, &quot;built this city&quot; pay off their student loans and otherwise support them.

They can make house calls on the rich.

            <description>Inequality: President Obama&apos;s class-envy strategy is built on a false premise — that the rich get richer at the expense of the poor. Amazingly, such zero-sum thinking is influencing public opinion.

Twice as many Americans support the anti-Wall Street protesters as oppose them. And even Rasmussen is polling that nearly half of Americans support proposals to soak the rich.

This is an emotional response to both the hard economic times and dishonest political rhetoric. People are buying into the notion peddled by the left that the rich steal from people. It&apos;s a pernicious myth left over from preindustrial Marxism.

What happens when the U.S. gets credible evidence Iran has carried out or planned violent acts against Americans, here or abroad?

For an answer, follow the talk (much) and action (none) after news last week that the FBI thwarted an alleged attempt by Iran&apos;s Quds Force to blow up Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi ambassador to the U.S.

            <description>Election &apos;12: A governor of an energy-rich state would use the &quot;energy of the past&quot; to create the jobs of the present rather than placing bets on solar panels and tilting at windmills.

During the GOP presidential debates, Gov. Rick Perry was criticized for taking all the credit for Texas&apos; job-creation record since he was not responsible for the oil and gas in the ground that created many of those jobs.

True enough. But like Sarah Palin, the governor of another energy-rich state, he did foster a business-friendly climate as free from NIMBY regulations as possible, making the extraction of that energy a reality. He has fought the good fight against an Environmental Protection Agency that is at war with Texas — an EPA determined to shut down domestic fossil fuel production.

            <title>The President&apos;s Strange Bedfellows  10.17.11</title>
            <description>The Left: Barack Obama&apos;s promised agenda of &quot;change&quot; was supposed to be about ending Washington&apos;s petty differences. But he has now aligned himself with a radical fringe seeking to destabilize the U.S. financial system.

&apos;Dr. King would want us to challenge the excesses of Wall Street without demonizing those who work there,&quot; President Obama said on Sunday during the dedication of the new Martin Luther King memorial in Washington.

Sorry Mr. President, but trying to play both sides of the street doesn&apos;t fly. You are either for or against the anti-capitalist revolutionaries of the Occupy Wall Street movement as they trample the public assembly laws, threaten to clog up the courts with their minions, and literally trample the American flag.

            <itunes:summary>The Left: Barack Obama&apos;s promised agenda of &quot;change&quot; was supposed to be about ending Washington&apos;s petty differences. But he has now aligned himself with a radical fringe seeking to destabilize the U.S. financial system.

&apos;Dr. King would want us to challenge the excesses of Wall Street without demonizing those who work there,&quot; President Obama said on Sunday during the dedication of the new Martin Luther King memorial in Washington.

Sorry Mr. President, but trying to play both sides of the street doesn&apos;t fly. You are either for or against the anti-capitalist revolutionaries of the Occupy Wall Street movement as they trample the public assembly laws, threaten to clog up the courts with their minions, and literally trample the American flag.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Media Shill For OWS  10.17.11</title>
            <description>Journalism: A cache of new Occupy Wall Street emails shows several press types offering advice to the protesters. We&apos;d be shocked, except the mainstream media have been openly helping the Occupy movement all along.

In one of the hundreds of Occupy Wall Street emails now posted online, MSNBC&apos;s Dylan Ratigan warns occupiers that they shouldn&apos;t issue demands. &quot;The focus on simple shared principle and intent to align with all who agree with that principle is a unique strength,&quot; he advised.

Dylan isn&apos;t an activist. He&apos;s not a PR guy, either. He&apos;s allegedly a journalist, and one with a long list of journalistic credentials on his resume. Nevertheless, the left dismissed Ratigan&apos;s and other journalists&apos; email help, noting that they are avowed liberals. Maybe so, but try to imagine the reaction if Bill O&apos;Reilly were caught emailing tips to the Tea Party.

            <title>Uganda Foray Misses Big Picture  10.17.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: President Obama&apos;s decision to send U.S. troops to Uganda was a valid one. But its timing was odd, coming as the U.S. disengages from Iraq and enlists Kenya to hose out Somalia. What are his priorities?

First, there&apos;s nothing seriously wrong with President Obama&apos;s decision to send 100 U.S. troops to aid Uganda in its war against the Lord&apos;s Resistance Army. The LRA is the 20-year terrorist plague that has unleashed untold horrors not just in Uganda but in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic (CAR).

And make no mistake, it&apos;s in the U.S. interest. Those countries are our allies as well as frontline states against Islamofascism and have asked for help. Their bill from LRA&apos;s depredations already runs in the billions and costs them investment and development.

            <title>There&apos;s No Dearth Of Job-Creating Ideas  10.14.11</title>
            <description>Jobs: President Obama routinely claims that Republicans haven&apos;t offered any jobs plan. Not true. It&apos;s just that Obama ignores any idea that doesn&apos;t involve more federal spending, meddling and taxes.

When President Obama called House Majority Leader John Boehner on Thursday to congratulate him for getting three trade deals passed, Boehner gave Obama an earful for repeatedly charging the GOP with jobs negligence.

On Thursday, for example, Obama said, &quot;I&apos;m hoping that they actually put forward some proposals that indicate that they feel that sense of urgency about ... needing to put people back to work right now.&quot;

Boehner helpfully reminded Obama that the House actually did put out a jobs plan in May — called &quot;The House Republican Plan for America&apos;s Job Creators&quot; — and that his leadership team had several talks with Obama and his staff about it, according to Politico.

Also Thursday, Senate Republicans released their own jobs proposal, which means that Republicans now have twice as many jobs plans as Obama.

Obama&apos;s disinterest in these plans shows just how far out of the mainstream he&apos;s drifted. After all, most of the GOP&apos;s job-growth ideas — regulatory reform, tax reform, more energy production and fiscal restraint — have been proposed by Obama&apos;s own advisers.

            <title>Alibis Falling Apart  10.14.11</title>
            <description>Crime: An old news tape shows that President Obama directly contradicted Attorney General Eric Holder&apos;s testimony to Congress about when he knew of Operation Fast and Furious. How many times will the story change?

An administration that keeps shifting its story is obviously trying to hide something. Nowhere is that more obvious than in the latest revelations about the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&apos; Fast and Furious scandal, which helped arm Mexico&apos;s violent cartels as a means to whip up support for gun control.

As the gamy details seeped out and Congress started asking questions, Holder testified to Congress on May 3 that he knew nothing about the operation gone bad.

&quot;When did you first know about the program officially I believe called Fast and Furious? To the best of your knowledge, what date?&quot; asked House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa.

&quot;I&apos;m not sure of the exact date, but I probably heard about Fast and Furious for the first time over the last few weeks,&quot; said Holder.

That contrasts sharply with what President Obama told a CNN En Espanol interviewer last March:

            <title>Romney&apos;s Bad Advice   10.14.11</title>
            <description>Campaigning: The GOP front-runner for 2012 sought advice on global warming and carbon emissions from the president&apos;s current science czar — an advocate of de-developing America and population control.

Politics is said to make strange bedfellows, but no coupling in our view is more bizarre than when John Holdren, now President Obama&apos;s assistant for science and technology, once advised GOP presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney on environmental policy.

Holdren&apos;s bizarre views are best suited for an adviser to someone like, say, Pol Pot.

He views humanity as a plague on the planet and the Industrial Revolution as a tragic mistake. The fewer people, he believes, the better, and he&apos;s not shy about the ways he would use to reduce their number.

Why Gov. Romney, a reasonable person, would pick such a man to advise him on anything is beyond us.

On Jan. 1, 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to regulate CO2 emissions from power plants, something the Obama administration is trying to do to all states through the Environmental Protection Agency&apos;s draconian job-killing regulations and mandates.

            <title>Twisting Words To Political Ends  10.14.11</title>
            <description>Politics: When your jobs policy fails to bring jobs, how do you fudge your call for more of the same? If you&apos;re the White House, you start stretching the boundaries of the English language.

When it became clear to President Obama and his economic and political advisers that spending more than a trillion dollars would not create many jobs, they decided that the problem wasn&apos;t their policies; it was the word &quot;create.&quot;

And so we endlessly heard promises of all of the millions of jobs their massive stimulus and government takeover of health insurance would &quot;save or create.&quot;

But with unemployment at 9.1% — not the under 8% they boldly predicted — and 14 million Americans jobless less than 13 months before Election Day 2012, &quot;save or create&quot; has worn kind of thin.

So the latest Orwellian Newspeak the White House is offering as a substitute for &quot;save and create&quot; is a promise about how many jobs the new Obama stimulus plan will &quot;support.&quot;

As blogger Ed Morrissey quips on HotAir.com, this new term contains &quot;even less meaning than their previous measure.&quot; Less meaning equals less accountability.

According to the administration, &quot;The American Jobs Act Will Support Nearly 400,000 Education Jobs.&quot;

            <title>An Archipelago Of Progress  10.13.11</title>
            <description>American Power: Congress&apos; passage of three long-stalled free-trade treaties opens spectacular new paths for economic gains for the U.S. and its partners. A Pacific Century lies ahead, and it&apos;s about something bigger than China.

The addition of Colombia, Panama and South Korea to our 17-strong list of free-trade partners opens up opportunities on a scale not seen since the expansion of the Wild West, and the U.S. stands to gain immensely.

Just look at the geography of it. Colombia and Panama fill in missing pieces of a free-trade zone that runs down the entire Pacific Coast. From Canada&apos;s icy Northwest Territories, through the equatorial tropics to Chile&apos;s Tierra del Fuego, we now anchor an 8,000-mile-long trade zone that is longer than Siberia is wide.

            <description>Banking: Regulators have unveiled their long-awaited plan to limit the risk taken by U.S. banks. But the so-called Volcker Rule is a nightmarish piece of financial legislation that fixes nothing and may create another crisis.

When in doubt, regulate. That might be the motto of the current White House. It certainly describes the latest dictum to spring out of the egregious Dodd-Frank financial reforms. The Volcker rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, aims to avoid another financial meltdown like the one that devastated Wall Street from 2007 to 2009.

It does so by barring banks from making short-term trades for profit in their own accounts in securities, derivatives and other exotic financial products. The new rules would also prohibit banks from holding more than 3% ownership in hedge or private equity funds.

            <title>Tea Libel  10.13.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: Refusing to take the blame for the wretched Obama economy, Democrats are turning to a desperate strategy: blaming their most virulent critics, the Tea Party.

You&apos;d think it would be impossible for Democrats to direct blame elsewhere for an extravagant stimulus they enacted — with no Republican support — when they controlled the White House and held comfortable majorities in the Congress.

But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the third-ranking Senate Democrat, has found a way: libel the Tea Party, a movement that has absolutely nothing to do with the economic policies now in place.

            <description>Well, first we had some looney real estate guy named Donald Trump surging in the Republican presidential field for the 2012 nomination.

Then, we had an Iowa-born representative from Minnesota named Michele Bachmann — did you know she was a federal tax attorney and has raised 23 foster children? — surging.

Then, it was Texas Gov. Rick Perry&apos;s turn to surge to the front of the GOP pack.

            <description>Solargate: On the program&apos;s last day, a billion-dollar loan guarantee went to another politically connected solar outfit in financial trouble. Fiscal insanity is throwing good money after bad and expecting a different result.

They say haste makes waste. But then, so does government. And when you combine the two you get a real mess.

Such was the case when the Department of Energy found itself with $4.75 billion in unallocated loan guarantees as the stimulus loan program responsible for the Solyndra fiasco was ending at the end of September.

            <title>An Act Of War  10.12.11</title>
            <description>Security: An Iran that&apos;s building nuclear weapons sponsors a shot at terrorism and murder on U.S. soil. Will we wait until Ahmadinejad&apos;s operatives come across our porous Southern border with a dirty bomb?

The good news is the Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. with a car bomb at a Washington, D.C., restaurant was foiled. The bad news is that Iran even attempted to strike inside America.

This is something that speaks to the fruits of President Obama&apos;s apology tour: Those that should fear us don&apos;t. Iran doesn&apos;t fear America or possible retaliation any more than it did when the Iranian-backed terrorist group Hezbollah murdered 241 U.S. service members in their Beirut barracks in 1983.

What will we do? Cut off a few more bank accounts? Ask for more meaningless sanctions? We bomb Libya, the mouse that roared, but won&apos;t even send so much as an iPhone to Iranian dissidents who share a common enemy — Tehran.

In 2009, when Iranian dissidents risked their lives to demonstrate against the gray-beard mullahs oppressing them, Tehran paused briefly as the Soviet Union did in Hungary in 1956. Seeing no Western support for the uprising, Tehran unleashed its security apparatus to suppress and murder — much as Moscow ordered the tanks to roll into Budapest. Now we are Iran&apos;s target.

            <title>It&apos;s The CRA, Stupid!  10.12.11</title>
            <description>Meltdown: To their chagrin, the media elite moderating the latest GOP presidential debate got schooled in the real causes of the financial crisis by the line-up of candidates.

At Tuesday&apos;s forum, the Washington Post&apos;s Karen Tumulty asked Michele Bachmann if she thought Wall Street bankers have been sufficiently punished for &quot;the damage they did to the economy.&quot; Only, the Minnesota congresswoman didn&apos;t take the bait, instead giving the misinformed Tumulty a much-needed education.

&quot;If you look at the problem with the economic meltdown, you can trace it right back to the federal government,&quot; she said. &quot;It was the federal government that pushed the subprime loans. It was the federal government that pushed the Community Reinvestment Act.&quot;

One of the worst rules on the books, the CRA fed the subprime bubble by requiring banks to underwrite a share of their loans in high-risk, unprofitable areas.

Newt Gingrich backed her up. Even media darling Ron Paul chimed in that the CRA led to &quot;malinvestment&quot; among banks. &quot;But the federal government has also deregulated them,&quot; Tumulty protested.

Not in the way she thinks. Starting in the mid-1990s, in a major switch, regulators no longer enforced traditional lending rules. Prudent underwriting was deemed racist and banks were judged on how &quot;flexible&quot; they could be in qualifying &quot;nontraditional&quot;credit cases. The more they bent their old rules and the more lower-income minority borrowers they rubberstamped for loans, the better they did on their all-important CRA examinations.

            <title>Opponent Is Obama, Not Bernanke  10.12.11</title>
            <description>Politics: You&apos;d think a Republican debate on the economy would be a perfect time to blast Obama policies as an unmitigated disaster. Yet Obama escaped largely unscathed. Whom do these folks think they&apos;re running against?

If aliens landed Tuesday night and managed to find the GOP debate on Bloomberg TV, they might think the GOP candidates were running against Ben Bernanke, someone named Dodd-Frank, Obama-Care and China.

Newt Gingrich focused his ire, for example, on Bernanke, saying he&apos;s &quot;the first person to fire.&quot; Michele Bachmann went on about Dodd-Frank, calling it &quot;the jobs and housing destruction act.&quot; Rick Santorum said he wants to &quot;go to war with China.&quot;

And of course, everyone pledged to ax ObamaCare.

OK, fine. But what about Obama? You know, the guy they want to defeat in November 2012? When his name came up at all, he mainly got polite jabs.

At one point Mitt Romney said of Obama that &quot;you have a president who I think is well-meaning but just over his head when it comes to the economy.&quot; In over his head? That&apos;s Obama&apos;s problem? So all he needs are better advisers and more experience?

            <title>Admit It: It&apos;s Victory  10.12.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: The biggest free-trade pacts since NAFTA were passed by the House Wednesday night, with the Senate likely to follow. As a result, America will reap 250,000 jobs and $13 billion in exports. Where are the celebrations?

The strangest aspect of the passage of free trade treaties with Colombia, South Korea and Panama, with final votes taken after five long years, is the disconnect between the big economic gains expected for the U.S., and the reticence of congressional Democrats and the White House, both of which finally got something right on the economy.

As we went to press, the pacts had been passed by the House, with the Senate expected to vote soon. With bipartisanship like that, lawmakers should be cheering loudly for a true &quot;jobs bill&quot; that costs nothing.

Yet as a Democratic aide told Roll Call on Wednesday, &quot;Republicans don&apos;t want to give the president a victory, Democrats are split and everyone is distracted.&quot;

Excuse us, but this is some of the best economic news in three years. It deserves a victory dance.

It&apos;s a fact these treaties will bring new orders for factories, save family farms, strengthen strategic alliances with countries well worth having as allies, and open up breathtaking new opportunities in fast-growing markets. It needs to be acknowledged.

            <title>Ukraine&apos;s Ruling, Russia&apos;s Benefit   10.11.11</title>
            <description>Freedom: A Ukraine court&apos;s decision Tuesday to imprison Orange Revolution heroine and former Premier Yulia Tymoshenko on bogus charges over a gas deal she made with Russia is a travesty. Now only Russia can benefit.

Ukraine&apos;s internal politics reared its ugly head again when Judge Radion Kireyev found Tymoshenko &quot;guilty&quot; of exceeding her authority as prime minister over a gas deal she signed with Russia in 2009 and sentenced her to seven years&apos; prison. Her crime? That she didn&apos;t get a low enough price for the gas Ukraine buys from the barons of Moscow — who hold a monopoly on supply.

Ukraine, remember, is a critical pipeline route for Russian natural gas supplies to Europe — and as a result has been in the middle of a strategic tug of war over tilting toward democratic Europe or oligarchical Moscow.

            <title>Killing A Religion   10.11.11</title>
            <description>Intolerance: One of the most tragic results of our Middle East policy is that, along with all the money and lives squandered, we seem to be abetting the Muslim world in its efforts to kill off Christianity.

A major religion representing nearly a third of the world&apos;s 6.8 billion people is under harsh and constant attack. No, it&apos;s not Islam, which by law gets privileged but largely unneeded legal protection in both Europe and North America. It&apos;s Christianity, under siege as never before in many countries, but especially across the Mideast and South Asia.

Take Afghanistan, where — as noted Tuesday in a CNSNews.com report citing the U.S. State Department — &quot;there is not a single, public Christian church left.&quot;

            <title>A Transparent Betrayal On Open Gov&apos;t  10.11.11</title>
            <description>Secrecy: President Obama promised &quot;a new era of open and accountable government.&quot; Now, amid scandals and an unlikely re-election, congressional allies want his documents locked away from historians and journalists.

On his first day in office, Obama sent out an internal memo with this declaration: &quot;My administration is committed to creating an unprecedented level of openness in government&quot; because &quot;openness will strengthen our democracy and promote efficiency and effectiveness in government.&quot;

A funny thing happened on the way to the open forum. How, for instance, are Obama critics doing in obtaining government documents? Judicial Watch, the conservative foundation that investigates misconduct by government officials, has filed hundreds of nonnational security Freedom of Information Act requests under Obama, but has been routinely stonewalled.

            <description>Leadership: Leaked cables show Japan nixed a presidential apology to Hiroshima and Nagasaki for using nukes to end the overseas contingency operation known as World War II. Will the next president apologize for the current one?

The obsessive need of this president to apologize for American exceptionalism and our defense of freedom continued recently when Barack Obama&apos;s State Department (run by Hillary Clinton) contacted the family of al-Qaida propagandist and recruiter Samir Khan to &quot;express its condolences&quot; to his family.

Khan, a right-hand man to Anwar al-Awlaki, was killed along with Awlaki in an airstrike in Yemen on Sept. 30. We apologized for killing a terrorist before he could help kill any more of us.

            <title>The Best Tax Plan: Spend Less  10.11.11</title>
            <description>Politics: Is 9-9-9 good policy? Or does the answer even matter? Sweeping revenue reforms tend not to become law. Even if they do, the same old vices remain on the outlay side.

Whatever happens to his candidacy, Herman Cain has made a real contribution to the nation&apos;s tax debate with his 9-9-9 plan. If nothing else, it&apos;s a counterweight to the ever-popular idea of closing the deficit by squeezing the rich.

The GOP hopeful is saying, with his three little numbers, that the most efficient and fairest tax is one that spreads the lightest possible burden as widely as possible. Just about everyone pays something, but no one has to pay all that much.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-run mortgage enterprises, weirdly were never included in President Obama&apos;s supposed financial reform.

Now, looking at a federal debt growing by nearly $1.5 trillion a year, many of the same foreign investors who fueled our housing boom are wondering if they&apos;ll ever get their money back.

            <description>Corruption: Government documents indicate that the White House plan to financially aid a failing green energy company might have been outside the law. The sun never sets on the Solyndra scandal.

On Friday, while most of America was preparing for the weekend and not paying attention to the news, the government released a batch of Solyndra emails.

They showed that Treasury Department and Office of Management and Budget officials were concerned about the Energy Department&apos;s giving Solyndra more money even after the failed company had defaulted on its $535 million government loan.

            <description>Scandal: The attorney general once again pleads ignorance as some 40 Fast and Furious weapons are found at a Mexican drug lord&apos;s home. If the AG doesn&apos;t read memos, maybe he can read a subpoena.

After Eric Holder was involved in the pardoning of international fugitive Marc Rich, he confessed to not doing a thorough check of Rich&apos;s history and background. When he criticized Arizona&apos;s immigration law, SB1070, he admitted to not even reading the law. Now, with dead bodies and illegal weapons piled up high in Fast and Furious, Holder says he didn&apos;t read the memos.

Holder&apos;s &quot;Sgt. Schultz&quot; defense that he knew, saw and heard nothing about the ATF&apos;s gun-running operation does not wash with the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Darrell Issa.

            <description>Failed Policy: The Nobel Prize for Economics goes to two Americans who have separately exposed the flaws in government stimulus spending. For a Keynesian president, it&apos;s the Anti-Peace Prize.

When President Obama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize during his first year in office, detractors said it was for doing nothing.

That can&apos;t be said for Thomas Sargent of New York University and Princeton&apos;s Christopher Sims, whose macroeconomics work has been of invaluable help to central bankers and other economic policymakers, and for which they now share this year&apos;s economics Nobel.

That can&apos;t be said for Thomas Sargent of New York University and Princeton&apos;s Christopher Sims, whose macroeconomics work has been of invaluable help to central bankers and other economic policymakers, and for which they now share this year&apos;s economics Nobel.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Dems&apos; Stimulus Idea: More Regulations  10.10.11</title>
            <description>Red Tape: Businesses might see the Obama administration&apos;s regulations as a millstone around the economy&apos;s neck. But Democrats say they&apos;ve got it all wrong. Regulations create jobs, you see, and we need more of them.

Last week, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., issued a report defending the Environmental Protection Agency from GOP attacks. Not only do EPA rules protect the environment, the report says, they are an engine of economic growth.

After all, somebody has to do the work of complying with the rules, and &quot;industries that provide environmental protection,&quot; the report says, have &quot;created more than a million jobs.&quot;

            <description>Politics: As Democrats, corporations and billionaires fell all over themselves to cheer Wall Street mobs protesting capitalism and demanding free rides, the lone voice of Herman Cain challenging them spoke for the rest of us.

The unkempt protesters and their tent camps, garbage heaps and drum circles making Wall Street and other U.S. cities unbearable don&apos;t have an articulate set of demands.

But their desire to end capitalism and still enjoy free-flowing government largesse is a constant, along with their nonstop claim to represent the &quot;middle class.&quot;

            <title>State V. Church At High Court  10.07.11</title>
            <description>First Amendment: The administration seeks new power over hiring and firing at religious institutions. This is more than just a culture-war skirmish. It&apos;s a threat to liberty.

Americans constantly hear warnings about the threats posed by the religious right to the separation of church and state. Like prayers at high school football games, these usually turn out to be trivial or symbolic, and no threat at all.

Much less is said about encroachments from the political left. These are more dangerous, both to religious institutions and to civil society in general. When government can make the rules for communities of faith, there&apos;s little else that stands in its way.

One such threat comes from an Obama administration that is trying to limit the hiring and firing powers of religious institutions.

It has taken up the cause of a teacher, Cheryl Perich, who was fired by a church-run Lutheran school in Michigan after filing a suit under federal disability law. She&apos;d been refused her old job after an extended disability leave; the school argues it fired her because she refused its offer to deal with the matter internally.

What makes this case different from a garden-variety discrimination case is that Perich was, in the eyes of the church that &quot;called&quot; her to her full-time teaching post in 2000, a minister. She taught religious as well as secular content and led prayers.

            <title>George Soros, Agent Of Chaos  10.07.11</title>
            <description>The Left: Billionaire George Soros declared sympathy for the mobs swarming Wall Street and blaming banks for the economy. Strange that a man who should be anathema to these parasites&apos; agenda is actually their patron.

The &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; blame-the-banks movement in New York and other large cities is proving itself to be more AstroTurf than grass-roots political movement by the day.

The latest presence: billionaire big-foot hedge-fund speculator George Soros who has declared fealty to this unkempt bunch. &quot;Actually, I can understand (the protestors&apos;) sentiment, frankly,&quot; he told reporters in New York. &quot;I can sympathize with their grievances.&quot;

Not only is the $22 billion-dollar man declaring the motley mob the protagonists in a vast struggle against capitalism, the activist groups he&apos;s funded, such as the Tides Foundation, MoveOn.org, and a new one, led by self-described communist Van Jones called &quot;Rebuild the Dream,&quot; are now its most active organizers.

&quot;People before profits,&quot; &quot;Occupying Wall Street,&quot; and &quot;Marx was right&quot; are the result, which can be read in the protest signs on Wall Street. And the common thread in all of this is to blame banks.

That makes Soros&apos; presence curious. For one thing, two years ago, Soros was a vocal proponent of bank bailouts himself. The U.S. needs &quot;radical and unorthodox policy measures&quot; to prevent a repeat of the Great Depression, he told Reuters in 2009, calling for all of TARP&apos;s $700 billion in funds to recapitalize banks and write down U.S. accumulated debt.

            <title>&apos;Must Pass&apos; Bill Must Be Nuked  10.07.11</title>
            <description>Politics: We&apos;ve long argued the jobs bill was nothing more than a re-election stunt. Now we have our proof, as Senate Democrats deploy the nuclear option to prevent a vote on this &quot;must-pass&quot; legislation.

For a full month now, President Obama has insisted that Congress &quot;pass this bill.&quot; And for a full month, his own party has steadfastly refused to bring it up for a vote.

First, Majority Leader Harry Reid claimed the Senate calendar was just too darned &quot;jammed&quot; to squeeze a vote in, hoping no one would notice that the only actual work the Senate had done over the past month was on legislation such as honoring National Estuaries Day.

Then, after a weeklong vacation, Reid said Obama&apos;s &quot;must pass right away&quot; jobs bill would have to wait until the Senate took up a dead-on-arrival bill attacking China for currency manipulation. &quot;Right away,&quot; he explained, was &quot;a relative term.&quot;

All the while, Obama has been running around the country blaming Republicans for blocking his bill, with pliant media regurgitating the charge. But all the while Democrats were blocking passage of the bill — since many wouldn&apos;t vote for its reckless new spending and economically ruinous tax hikes. That&apos;s why Reid has made increasingly lame excuses for putting off a vote.

The White House has thrown in with the anticapitalism crowd, and banks had better watch out. You only had to hear President Obama&apos;s cynical, politicized expressions of sympathy for the unwashed legions &quot;occupying&quot; Wall Street this week to be worried.

&quot;Not only did the financial sector, with the Republican Party in Congress, fight us every step of the way,&quot; Obama said at his news conference Thursday. &quot;But now you&apos;ve got these same folks arguing we should roll back all those reforms and go back to the way it was.&quot;

            <description>Politics: Sarah Palin&apos;s decision not to run for president left many of her supporters dispirited. We&apos;re more sanguine. Fact is, there are more than enough reasons why Palin will continue to lead and to matter.

Speaking on The Mark Levin Show Wednesday, Palin startled many by declaring: &quot;After much prayer and serious consideration, I have decided that I will not be seeking the 2012 GOP nomination for President of the United States.&quot;

Her statement read: &quot;As always, my family comes first and obviously Todd and I put great consideration into family life before making this decision.&quot;

            <description>Recovery: The president claims economists heartily endorse his jobs bill, predicting it will boost growth by 2% and add 1.9 million jobs. That would be news to most economists.

How does he &quot;know&quot; this? Well, he said at Friday&apos;s news conference, that&apos;s based on a review of his plan by &quot;independent economists.&quot; He even challenged Republicans to have their own plan assessed by the same experts to see how theirs would perform.

&quot;I see some smirks in the audience because you know that it&apos;s not going to be real robust,&quot; he said, commenting on the reaction from reporters.

            <itunes:summary>Recovery: The president claims economists heartily endorse his jobs bill, predicting it will boost growth by 2% and add 1.9 million jobs. That would be news to most economists.

How does he &quot;know&quot; this? Well, he said at Friday&apos;s news conference, that&apos;s based on a review of his plan by &quot;independent economists.&quot; He even challenged Republicans to have their own plan assessed by the same experts to see how theirs would perform.

&quot;I see some smirks in the audience because you know that it&apos;s not going to be real robust,&quot; he said, commenting on the reaction from reporters.</itunes:summary>

            <title>The Death Of Entrepreneurship  10.06.11</title>
            <description>Steve Jobs: The college dropout who started a company called Apple changed the world and our lives for the better, creating jobs, wealth and opportunity. He didn&apos;t need an industrial policy picking winners and losers.

It is fitting that many people learned of the passing of Steve Jobs on devices of his making. The iPods and iPads that sprang from his creative imagination and bold leadership have changed society in ways that can&apos;t be counted, starting with the way we obtain and disseminate news and entertainment.

He joins the pantheon of American genius that includes Thomas Edison, the Wright Brothers, Henry Ford and many others before and after who demonstrated what free minds in a free country that relied on free markets were capable of.

            <title>Is U.S. Duplicating EU&apos;s Debt Mistakes?  10.05.11</title>
            <description>Crisis: Greece and Italy sneeze, and the rest of Europe catches cold. Slowly, the once-mighty European Union seems to be falling apart under the weight of its accumulated debts. Is this what they mean by financial contagion?

Moody&apos;s downgrade of Italy&apos;s debt on Wednesday has cast a pall over efforts by the European Union to shore up the currency zone&apos;s collapsing finances.

Just last week, the EU thought it might have turned a corner after Germany approved a 440 billion euro bailout fund for near-bankrupt countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Ireland and Belgium. Turns out that optimism was unwarranted.

EU officials now say they&apos;ll need at least 800 billion euros to stop the bleeding. That&apos;s more than $1 trillion, and some think they might need as much as $2 trillion.

And as if that wasn&apos;t enough, it was reported that the euro zone&apos;s service sector shrank in September for the first time in two years. Only last month, economists expected the 17-nation bloc to eke out a minuscule 0.2% rate of GDP growth in the second half. Now, with its economy shrinking, a full-on recession seems likely.

For undercapitalized European banks, this is very bad news: As countries and consumers stop paying debts, they threaten to go bust.

            <title>&apos;Jobs Bill&apos; To Tax Bill   10.05.11</title>
            <description>Economic Policy: How do you sweeten for Democratic senators legislation with hundreds of billions more in spending when Americans are fed up seeing their economic future being spent away? Just add taxes.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., laid it all bare on the Senate floor on Tuesday when he asked Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid for unanimous consent to vote on the White House&apos;s jobs bill, which the president has repeatedly insisted be passed &quot;right away.&quot;

Reid was quick to say, &quot;No thanks.&quot; That&apos;s because the Democrats have the majority in the Senate to pass President Obama&apos;s Stimulus 2.0, but not the votes. And Reid is busy rewriting the bill to get more support.

One of the president&apos;s main selling points in his prime time speech to Congress last month was that &quot;everything in this bill will be paid for. Everything.&quot; Well, Reid is scrambling to substitute Obama&apos;s financing measures with, you guessed it, a big, fat tax increase.

The Senate Democratic leader is reportedly formulating a 5% tax surcharge on &quot;millionaires&quot; (translation: job creators). This, after the president had already included higher taxes on families earning more than $250,000, plus new taxes on the oil and gas industry.

            <title>No News Is Gun News   10.05.11</title>
            <description>Journalism: The administration&apos;s fast and furious response to one TV reporter&apos;s story on its gunrunning to Mexico raises no cries of &quot;chilling effect&quot; from mainstream media that have largely ignored the story.

Silencers are mechanisms placed on the muzzles of firearms to deaden their sound. It&apos;s not a word that should be applied to the administration or its unindicted co-conspirators in the media regarding Operation Gunrunner and its offshoot, Fast and Furious.

This is a scandal, and a cover-up, of major proportions: the deliberate supplying of weapons by the U.S. government to Mexican drug cartels that led to the death of two American agents and possible perjury by the attorney general of the United States. His denying knowledge of it to Congress makes Watergate look like a third-rate burglary.

Yet two of the mainstream networks, ABC and NBC, have turned a blind eye.

As the folks at NewsBusters.org report, ABC&apos;s Josh Klein did a two-sentence news brief on the June 15 edition of &quot;Good Morning America.&quot; NBC hasn&apos;t covered the story on any of its news programs since April 17.

CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson, to her credit, has pursued the story with diligence, including exposing the falsity of Attorney General Eric Holder&apos;s testimony before Rep. Darrell Issa&apos;s House Oversight Committee on May 3 that he&apos;d just learned of Fast and Furious.

            <title>Rubio Vs. Univision   10.05.11</title>
            <description>Media: The president of Univision, the top Spanish-language network, made an apparent attempt to extort a TV appearance from Sen. Marco Rubio in exchange for not broadcasting dirt on a relative. Can it go any lower?

Last July, representatives of the Florida-based Hispanic national television network contacted the Florida Republican to urge him to appear on &quot;Al Punto,&quot; a Spanish-language talk show whose host, Jorge Ramos, is a loud proponent of amnesty for illegal aliens. Like most Americans, Rubio is no amnesty proponent and said no to an appearance on the show.

But Univision wouldn&apos;t take no for an answer. Instead, the ambitious television network that reaches 10 million Spanish-language viewers in the U.S. set a new low in journalism, with extortion worse than tabloids.

According to the Miami Herald, a 45-minute conference call was then arranged July 7 and Univision&apos;s president of news, Isaac Lee, made Rubio&apos;s staff an offer he couldn&apos;t refuse: Lee&apos;s investigative team had dug up some dirt on Rubio&apos;s brother-in-law — a 1987 drug arrest — and offered to spike it if Rubio would appear on &quot;Al Punto.&quot;

            <title>A Fee In His Bonnet  10.05.11</title>
            <description>Financial Reform: Sen. Dick Durbin is urging Bank of America customers to take their business elsewhere. Is this what passes for statesmanship in America today?

Durbin is upset that BofA is charging its debit-card customers a monthly $5 fee each. He calls it an &quot;outrage&quot; and has demanded that bank CEO Brian Moynihan cite &quot;specific and credible&quot; data to justify the charge.

&quot;Bank of America customers, vote with your feet,&quot; Durbin said Monday from the Senate floor. &quot;Get the heck out of that bank. Find yourself a bank or credit union that won&apos;t gouge you for $5 a month and still will give you a debit card that you can use every single day.&quot;

This seems like dangerous talk to us. At least talk that is unbecoming of an elected official. But Durbin isn&apos;t the only Democrat who wants to punish a private company that has changed its business due to federal meddling.

            <description>War On Terror: As al-Qaida cues up a post-mortem screed by Anwar Awlaki, sympathetic media are doing their own martyring. They claim U.S. warmongering made the terror traitor angry.

This is a pernicious lie, and demonstrably false. And the mainstream media should be ashamed of themselves for breezily corrupting American attitudes about one of the most diabolical figures in the war on terror.

U.S.-born Awlaki was a secret al-Qaida agent all along. He always hated his birthplace. The war didn&apos;t push him over the edge. In fact, he helped cause the war as a 9/11 co-conspirator.

            <description>Fed Policy: Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke thinks the economy&apos;s on the edge, but doesn&apos;t want Congress to do anything that might imperil a recovery. So what should it do?

It&apos;s been more than two years since the recession officially ended. Yet, speaking to Congress, the Fed chief warned &quot;the recovery is close to faltering.&quot;

Got that? After $2 trillion in &quot;stimulus,&quot; $1.8 trillion in Fed money printing, not to mention the past two months of Operation Twist (another $400 billion of Fed stimulus), we&apos;re still in danger of going under.

            <title>Alinsky Rules Return For Obama    10.04.11</title>
            <description>Politics: The hippie horde attempting to mob and &quot;occupy&quot; Wall Street this week has a method to its madness. It&apos;s all about getting President Obama re-elected by employing classic Alinskyite tactics.

At first glance, the latest protests staged by left-wing rent-a-mobs in New York, Washington, Los Angeles and elsewhere don&apos;t look terribly different from the World Trade Organization and global debt-amnesty spectaculars of a decade ago. Radicals swarm against some hated totem, chant, break a few Starbucks windows and leave scads of garbage for someone else to clean up.

But the &quot;Occupy Wall Street&quot; mob that shut down the Brooklyn Bridge last weekend and drew 700 arrests bears all the earmarks of a professional political machine effort to keep Obama in the White House.

            <description>Energy: Environmentalists are making a last stand against the Keystone XL pipeline with a scare campaign about groundwater. Time to review the facts and let the project proceed.

The Obama administration gets a lot wrong, but it does seem to be getting more clear-headed about oil.

This week, it announced it was moving ahead with oil leases that open a sizable swath of the Arctic Ocean to drilling. And it may soon give the green light to TransCanada Corp.&apos;s Keystone XL, a 1,700-mile, $7 billion pipeline that would bring oil from the tar sands of Alberta to refineries in Texas.

            <description>Responsibility: The president admits that Americans are not better off than they were four years ago — a fact he can hardly deny. But he steadfastly refuses to own up and take blame for his policy failures.

It was more than three decades ago, but the Great Communicator&apos;s simple, potent question still echoes today. Over the weekend, ex-Bill Clinton operative George Stephanopoulos of ABC News posed President Obama with the question Ronald Reagan asked Americans in 1980:

&quot;Are you better off than you were four years ago?&quot;

            <description>Scandal: A major-league pitcher was indicted for lying to Congress about steroid use. Administration memos show Eric Holder lied about what he knew about Fast and Furious and when he knew it. What&apos;s the difference?

Somewhere, Scooter Libby must be scratching his head. He was indicted and convicted simply because his recall of when a meeting occurred differed from others. He didn&apos;t lie about a gun-running operation that led to the deaths of two American agents and at least 200 Mexicans.

But Attorney General Eric Holder did, according to memos obtained by CBS News and Fox News.

To buttress the flimsy case of leftist groups like Common Cause that he step down from judging whether ObamaCare is unconstitutional, 20 House Democrats last week called for an investigation into Justice Thomas&apos; not filling out financial disclosure forms to their satisfaction regarding his wife&apos;s political activities.

Ginni Thomas&apos; pro-limited government activist group Liberty Central has indeed gone after ObamaCare. But as Mrs. Thomas pointed out last year, there are plenty of &quot;judicial wives and husbands out there causing trouble; I&apos;m just one of many.&quot;

            <description>Economy: After years of dithering and bowing to protectionists, President Obama finally submitted three pending free-trade pacts with South Korea, Panama and Colombia to Congress for a vote. Let the U.S. economy recover.

The president&apos;s decision marks the first bright economic move he has made to boost the nation&apos;s ailing economy. Dropping tariffs, opening markets and equalizing investment terms are a proven way to boost economic growth.

Contrary to all the nonsense about outsourcing and giant sucking sounds, the real impact of free trade is new freedom and opportunity.

Should it reach out to Syria, a terrorist state? Or Egypt, which may soon put the Muslim Brotherhood in power? How about Lebanon, which is largely controlled by Israel-hating Iran? Or Turkey, a NATO member that&apos;s now in the hands of Islamists?

            <title>Doc Dump: White House Knew    10.03.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: Friday&apos;s release of documents shows the extent of White House contact with the ATF over Operation Fast and Furious. Included is a map showing where the guns went in Mexico — enough weapons for a Marine unit.

In a classic news-dampening maneuver, some, but not all, documents requested by congressional investigators looking at administration gun-running were released late Friday by the White House. Usually this is done to avoid the full impact of politically embarrassing or, in this case, potentially incriminating news.

As we noted in July, Special Agent in Charge William Newell, recently promoted to a cushy job with a tighter leash in Washington, D.C., admitted in testimony on Capitol Hill that he had been in contact with then-White House National Security Council staffer Kevin O&apos;Reilly, who Newell said was a &quot;good friend.&quot;

            <title>EPA&apos;s Mission Leap    10.03.11</title>
            <description>Regulation: What does the Environmental Protection Agency say it needs to fully implement new greenhouse gas emissions rules? How about an army of 230,000 new bureaucrats and an additional $21 billion a year?

According to the Daily Caller news site, a court brief filed by the Justice Department on behalf of the EPA argues that the agency would need &quot;230,000 full-time employees necessary to produce the 1.4 billion work hours required&quot; to administer rules under the Clean Air Act. This added burden, it is reckoned, &quot;would result in an increase in Title V administration costs of $21 billion per year.&quot;

This scenario is part of a brief filed during a lawsuit brought against the agency by a trade group hoping to block the EPA&apos;s greenhouse gas regulatory regime. The group maintains that the Clean Air Act doesn&apos;t give EPA that authority.

            <itunes:summary>Regulation: What does the Environmental Protection Agency say it needs to fully implement new greenhouse gas emissions rules? How about an army of 230,000 new bureaucrats and an additional $21 billion a year?

            <title>On Deaf Ears    9.30.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: President Obama spent most of this month pressuring Congress to &quot;pass this jobs bill,&quot; but he can&apos;t even get his own party to support it. He&apos;s quickly turning into a leader without any followers.

In the past three weeks, Obama has been pleading with lawmakers to pass his American jobs act, so far intoning &quot;pass this bill&quot; 160 times. &quot;I&apos;ve already got the pens all ready, all lined up on my desk, ready to sign the bill,&quot; he said last week.

His desperate pleas are being met with, at best, indifference. Not from Republicans, whom Obama routinely accuses of putting party over country, but from his own Democrats.

For the past three weeks, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has been busy making excuses as to why he just couldn&apos;t find the time to schedule a vote on the bill, given the Senate&apos;s &quot;jammed&quot; schedule that included passing bills like the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act.

Now the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, Illinois&apos; Dick Durbin, has admitted there aren&apos;t enough votes to &quot;pass this bill&quot; because many Democrats won&apos;t support it.

&quot;The oil-producing-state senators don&apos;t like eliminating or reducing the subsidy for oil companies,&quot; Durbin told a Chicago radio station. &quot;There are some senators who are up for election who say &apos;I&apos;m never gonna vote for a tax increase while I&apos;m up for election, even on the wealthiest people.&apos;&quot;

            <title>Don&apos;t Cry Over Terrorist Awlaki&apos;s Death   9.30.11</title>
            <description>War On Terror: U.S. forces dealt a huge blow to al-Qaida&apos;s Western recruiting when they took out two American al-Qaida traitors on the Saudi-Yemen border. It&apos;s also a blow to the ACLU.

Dead: Anwar Awlaki, tops on the CIA kill list, and his understudy Samir Khan, both U.S. citizens blasted by drone-fired missiles.

Awlaki, a Muslim cleric who advised the 9/11 hijackers and the Fort Hood gunman, became al-Qaida&apos;s top recruiter and external operations chief in the Arabian Peninsula. Khan, a 25-year-old from Charlotte, N.C., joined him in Yemen, where he published in English al-Qaida&apos;s slick, new jihad how-to journal.

The American Civil Liberties Union had worked with Awlaki&apos;s father to block attempts by America to hit him, arguing that targeting U.S.-born terrorists set a &quot;dangerous precedent.&quot; To its credit, the White House fought the left-wing group&apos;s suit and did what&apos;s necessary to protect Americans.

Of course, the ACLU condemns the Awlaki &quot;assassination&quot; as a &quot;violation of both U.S. and international law.&quot; And it may bring further action against the U.S. drone program. &quot;As we&apos;ve seen today,&quot; an ACLU spokesman complained, &quot;it&apos;s a program under which U.S. citizens far from any battlefield can be executed by their own government without judicial process.&quot;

            <title>Solargate Opens Wide   9.30.11</title>
            <description>Corruption: It turns out a recent recipient of the administration&apos;s largesse is from the House of Pelosi. The green energy scandal keeps picking up speed.

Last week, the Energy Department completed a $737 million loan guarantee to Tonopah Solar Energy and an additional $337 million for Sempra Energy.

On the surface, there&apos;s nothing suggesting either is improper. But just beneath the surface is the clear appearance of impropriety.

Tonopah Solar is a wholly owned subsidiary of SolarReserve, which lists among its &quot;investment partners&quot; a company named Pacific Corporate Group. Again, on the surface, no hint of corruption.

But an enterprising blog called the American Glob dug a bit and found that &quot;The No. 2 guy at Pacific Corporate Group is Ronald Pelosi,&quot; who happens to be the brother-in-law of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

Fortune senior editor Dan Primack argues that &quot;it is patently false&quot; that Ronald Pelosi &quot;will benefit from the loan.&quot;

That&apos;s a bit of a stretch, though. He might not be free to put his hands on any of those taxpayers&apos; dollars. But if PCG benefits from the loan, so does he, just as any employee profits when his employer has healthy earnings or receives a windfall.

            <title>Thank Dodd-Frank For That Fee   9.30.11</title>
            <description>Politics: Damned as an &quot;outrage&quot; in the press, Bank of America&apos;s just-announced $5 monthly fee for ATM use was a logical and predictable result of a Dodd- Frank financial bill that fixed prices. Guess who gets to pay for it?

Throwing their weight around at the height of the banking crisis, House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank of Massachusetts and Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut vowed to stick it to banks. They blamed them for the mess to cover up the fact that they forced banks to lend to favored constituencies who could not repay.

The two Democrats pushed through the much-vaunted Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which President Obama signed and touted as one of the signature accomplishments of his presidency.

That act, which included a micromanaging amendment on fees, carried a $2.9 billion implementation cost for that alone over five years, according to the Government Accountability Office.

It was nothing but the same old pandering to special interests. Named after Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin, the amendment limited fees that banks can collect from sellers when their customers make debit card purchases — cutting 44 cent fees to 21 cents.

            <title>U.S. Abandons Space   9.30.11</title>
            <description>Exceptionalism: While the American space program is in a museum, Beijing orbits a nearly 9-ton space station module. Soon men will return to the moon, but they will likely be speaking Chinese.

While America was scanning the skies waiting for an aging satellite to fall to earth, China was looking to the skies and seeing its future.

On Thursday, Beijing launched into space aboard a Long March 2F rocket a space station module weighing 8.5 metric tons that will serve as a prototype for a 60-ton Chinese space lab to be in orbit by 2020.

Americans may yawn and say &quot;been there, done that&quot; and, besides, we have other things on our plate right now. But this latest nail in the coffin of American exceptionalism has serious implications for both U.S. leadership and security. China&apos;s space program is intimately connected to its military aspirations, and it views space as a venue for more than tadpole experiments.

Not long ago, Capt. Shen Zhong of the Chinese Navy Research Institute said: &quot;The mastery of outer space will be requisite for military victory, with outer space becoming the new venue for combat.&quot;

            <title>Bank Tax Would Make Europe&apos;s Malaise Worse   9.29.11</title>
            <description>European Union: Leaders dithering over Greek debt now want to squeeze financial markets. It&apos;s about &quot;fairness,&quot; they say. No, it&apos;s about denial, and it would only worsen the Continent&apos;s problems.

When it comes to shirking unpleasant business, the European Union these days actually makes Washington look good. One of its member states is clearly in default, and time is running short for a reasonably orderly write-down of the debt. So what&apos;s the EU&apos;s latest idea? Tax the banks because, well, people don&apos;t like them.

Technically, what the EU&apos;s executive body, the European Commission, proposed this week is a financial transaction tax. The idea is to skim at least 0.1% off every stock and bond sale and 0.01% off every derivative sale anywhere in the 27 EU nations, starting in 2014. The Commission claims it could raise about $75 billion a year this way.

            <description>Election &apos;12: In 1994, Newt Gingrich&apos;s &quot;Contract With America&quot; gave Republicans control of the House of Representatives. Can his new, bolder contract revive his presidential hopes?

Compare former House Speaker Newt Gingrich&apos;s &quot;21st Century Contract With America&quot; with Mitt Romney&apos;s timid &quot;Believe in America&quot; economic plan, and Gingrich wins hands-down.

Whereas the former Massachusetts governor &quot;will seek&quot; to keep the Bush tax cuts, for instance, and &quot;will seek&quot; to eliminate capital gains and other investment taxes on those making under $200,000, Gingrich would simply &quot;abolish the capital gains tax&quot; — no &quot;will seek&quot; about it, and no income threshold.

            <title>A Muslim President, After All   9.29.11</title>
            <description>Election 2012: Hispanics, blacks and others among President Obama’s base may be abandoning him, but Muslims are holding fast. Apparently, theirs is a special bond born of shared interests.

When Barack Hussein Obama first stepped into office in January 2009, he had 92% approval among blacks, 75% approval among Hispanics and 58% approval among whites, according to Gallup.

Since then, his monthly approval has dropped eight points among blacks, 27 points among Hispanics and 25 points among whites.

            <description>Solargate: Despite Solyndra, the administration shovels another billion out the door before the deadline as the lists of politically connected companies feeding at the public trough expands. Seems the sun also corrupts.

Follow the money, it has been said, and you&apos;ll find out all you need to know. Two days before the expiration of the program that funneled $535 million to a failing but donor-connected Solyndra, another billion dollars was rushed to two more solar energy companies. That money could have repaired more than a few crumbling bridges.

You&apos;d think the program would have been suspended until the administration found out what went wrong. Unless, of course, the program was functioning exactly as intended — to spread the wealth around with an emphasis on Democratic Party donors.

            <description>Election &apos;12: Herman Cain&apos;s victory in Florida&apos;s straw poll is notable, among other things, for his advocacy of &quot;Chilean Model&quot; Social Security reform in a state filled with retirees. It ought to be a wake-up call to all candidates.

Aside from the insta-analysis about Cain&apos;s victory being a protest vote against Texas Gov. Rick Perry, it&apos;s worth noticing that — in Florida, no less — both Cain and Perry, who finished first and second in the weekend&apos;s GOP straw poll, were the two most outspoken candidates about confronting the U.S. crisis in Social Security.

It completely ends the notion that addressing the issue of unfunded pension liabilities — in Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare — is the third rail of politics.

            <title>Combatting Child Poverty   9.29.11</title>
            <description>Family: Census data now show that a quarter of young children in America are mired in poverty. The media won&apos;t report on — and the president won&apos;t lead on — its root cause: an epidemic of illegitimacy.

The University of New Hampshire&apos;s Carsey Institute, analyzing U.S. Census data, alarmingly finds that from 2009 to 2010, 1 million more children entered into poverty, raising the total to 15.7 million poor kids, nearly a quarter of whom are below the age of six.

The Pew Hispanic Center reports a record 6.1 million Hispanic children in poverty vs. 5 million white children and 4.4 million black children — though, at 39%, black children suffer a higher poverty rate than Hispanic kids, at 35%. Both are well above the 12% rate among white children.

            <title>Editorial: Despite ObamaCare, Costs Continue To Soar   9.27.11</title>
            <description>Health Care: Until now, many of the fears about ObamaCare have been theoretical. But this year&apos;s 9% spike in premiums is concrete evidence of the substantial harm it&apos;s already doing to our health care system.

As soon as the Kaiser Family Foundation&apos;s annual report on insurance premiums was released, ObamaCare defenders dismissed its most troubling finding: Insurance premiums for family coverage shot up an average $1,482 this year.

Nothing to worry about, they said, it&apos;s just a response to higher health costs and bad forecasts. But wait a minute! Didn&apos;t Obama promise his signature health reform plan would lower insurance premiums? As a matter of fact he did, saying just before he signed it into law that ObamaCare would &quot;bring down the cost of health care for families, for businesses and for the federal government.&quot;

            <description>Education: With &quot;No Child Left Behind&quot; winding down, states now have the tools of school reform. But they need to show they&apos;re serious about using them, even if the teacher unions squeal.

It was just short of 10 years ago that President Bush signed the bill that — if not for 9/11 and all that ensued — might have defined his legacy.

By impressive bipartisan majorities, Congress had given him a measure with some grand goals. It was supposed to close the achievement gap between white and minority students. It aimed to bring all American schoolchildren up to &quot;proficiency&quot; in essential subjects by 2014. It imposed a system of progressively harsher sanctions on schools that didn&apos;t meet its standards.

            <description>Unnecessary Expense: More than four in 10 U.S. doctors believe that patients get too much health care. Maybe this extra treatment, not selfish physicians, is why medicine costs so much in this country.

A poll of primary care physicians found that 42% are convinced their patients are receiving too much care. Just more than half — 52% — believe the amount of care is right.

This wave of added care isn&apos;t cheap. As the demand rises, so do costs. It&apos;s an inviolable law of economics.

            <title>Gunrunner: Cash For Cartels   9.27.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: New documents reveal the Department of Justice lied to Congress and show how U.S. officials bought guns with tax dollars and then made sure no one stopped their transfer to Mexican drug cartels.

The funneling of thousands of American guns into the hands of Mexican drug cartels in the operation known as Fast and Furious was not a botched sting operation or the result of bureaucratic incompetence. It was not designed to interdict gun trafficking, but to facilitate it.

We now know that it involved not just the use of straw buyers, but also agents of the federal government purchasing weapons with taxpayer money, ordering the licensed dealers to conduct the sales off the books, then calling off surveillance of the gun traffickers and refusing to interdict the transfer of the weapon or arrest the people involved.

            <title>Getting Taxes All Wrong   9.27.11</title>
            <description>Fiscal Policy: The president seems confused, to put it politely, about the role taxes play in the economy. Unfortunately, Americans are paying a price for his lack of knowledge.

Speaking to potential donors in liberal, high-tech Mountain View, Calif., President Obama said that low taxes are a recipe for backwardness.

&quot;Right now, we&apos;ve got the lowest tax rates we&apos;ve had since the 1950s,&quot; Obama told the well-heeled crowd. &quot;And some of the Republican proposals would take it back — as a percentage of GDP — back to where we were back in the 1920s. You can&apos;t have a modern industrial economy like that.&quot;

            <title>Editorial: Who Says Herman Cain Is Unelectable?   9.26.11</title>
            <description>2012 Election: The various attempts to explain away Herman Cain&apos;s victory in the weekend&apos;s Florida straw poll all stem from the same underlying assumption: The guy is unelectable. Really? Based on what?

One political blogger summed up the general reaction to the Florida vote best: &quot;Rather than a legitimate outpouring of support for Cain, or a specific rejection of Rick Perry, this victory represents a resounding cry of &apos;who else ya got?&apos;&quot;

The implicit message is that voters couldn&apos;t have been legitimately backing Cain, since he has no chance of getting the nomination, much less the presidency. So the vote must have been about &quot;sending a message.&quot;

            <title>Believing The Big Lie   9.26.11</title>
            <description>Misplaced Blame: The Democrats are setting up the Republicans to be the party responsible for a federal shutdown, should one occur. Of course the media will go along for the ride, just as in 1995 and 1996.

In the fall of 1995, the GOP Congress passed a continuing resolution spending bill to keep the federal government open. Bill Clinton vetoed it.

Polls, in some cases more than 2-1, showed the public blamed the subsequent shutdowns — one in November 1995, the other from Dec. 16, 1995 to Jan. 6, 1996 — on the Republicans. The fact that the public believed as it did is nearly inexplicable, since it was the GOP that passed the spending bill and a Democrat who vetoed it.

            <description>Mideast: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu seeks direct, unconditional talks with the Palestinians, while movingly making the case for Israel&apos;s security. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas chooses bloodshed.

Militant Arabs seem to believe in regard to the U.S.-Israeli relationship what the Soviet Union did about the Cold War: that America will go soft; you just have to play the waiting game.

After speaking before the U.N. General Assembly over the weekend, Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu appeared on NBC&apos;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and was asked if the so-called Arab Spring had made Israel more isolated.

            <description>Scandal: Our ever-campaigning president heads off to a fundraiser held by a politically connected businessman whose company took a $100 million stimulus tax credit. Solyndra didn&apos;t stop pay-for-play the &quot;Chicago Way.&quot;

Tone-deaf somehow does not seem adequate to describe President Obama&apos;s silent indifference to the Solyndra scandal of his making as he rushes off to another fundraiser, a $25,000 per person affair in Missouri on Oct. 4 organized by another beneficiary of our stimulus tax dollars.

Tom Carnahan, of the Missouri Carnahans, arguably that state&apos;s most prominent political family, is listed on President Obama&apos;s campaign website as a host of the St. Louis fundraising extravaganza amid widespread unemployment and tanking markets.

            <title>Memo To GOP: The Foe Is Obama, Not Perry   9.23.11</title>
            <description>Politics: Despite the &quot;gotcha&quot; sniping at Thursday&apos;s debate, Republicans need to keep their eyes on the prize. The target for 2012 is not Santorum, Cain, Bachmann, Romney or Perry. It&apos;s the current White House occupant.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry must have felt a bit like Gen. Custer at Little Big Horn at the Orlando debate, a made-for-TV contrivance in which those who have a real chance to be president must take pokes and jabs from those who don&apos;t.

We appreciate this may be a necessary evil in which front-runners without stamina — the Ed Muskies and Rudy Giulianis, for example — are weeded out.

Still, we must understand that while the goal is the nomination, the prize is the White House. Lost in the brouhaha over tuition for illegal aliens and mandated vaccines is the fact we simply can&apos;t afford four more years of President Obama.

Perry has given awkward responses. How can he debate the president, the whispers ask. Sound-bite debates in which you thrust and parry (no pun intended) with eight other candidates, as well as the pundits, are one thing. Comparing your job-creating pro-growth record in a booming state to the record of the arguably worst president in American history is something else.

            <title>Shutdown For What?    9.23.11</title>
            <description>Budget: If Senate Democrats hope to pin a government shutdown on Republicans, they&apos;ve picked a pretty lousy hostage — a Bush-era &quot;green&quot; program that&apos;s benefiting two boutique, luxury-car makers.

On Friday, the House narrowly approved a stop-gap funding measure that would provide disaster relief and keep the government running after Sept. 30, when the 2011 fiscal year officially ends. Since Congress has so far failed to pass a 2012 budget, the government will shut down Oct. 1 without the six-week spending bill.

Keep in mind that the only reason we&apos;re in this fix is because Senate Democrats never bothered to pass a budget — a duty they&apos;ve managed to neglect for more than two years. The House passed its 2012 budget plan back in April.

Nevertheless, sensing an opportunity to pin a government shutdown on the GOP, Senate Democrats voted down the spending bill. But the only reason they could find for doing so is a provision that would cut $1.5 billion from a Department of Energy loan program.

Apparently, Majority Leader Harry Reid and company never bothered to look closely at the program they plan to use as hostage in these negotiations.

The Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program was signed into law under President Bush as a way to encourage development of advanced fuel-saving technologies. So far, the DOE has used it to issue about $9 billion in federal loan guarantees.

            <title>Bill Clinton, Home Wrecker   9.23.11</title>
            <description>Subprime Scandal: Bill Clinton has summoned the media to listen to his take on the never-ending financial crisis. But the man who is now portrayed as an oracle was in fact its chief architect.

In an interview for his annual Clinton Global Initiative meeting in New York, the former president blamed the mortgage meltdown and ensuing record poverty on a &quot;30-year anti-government rant.&quot;

&quot;The American Dream has been under assault for 30 years,&quot; Clinton said, lecturing banks to &quot;clean up their financial books&quot; of all the toxic mortgages they made.

This is galling even for Bill Clinton.

He&apos;s the one who originally pushed them to make those really dumb loans. And then he baited Wall Street to game the perverse system he created. Nobody put the American Dream of owning — and keeping — a home &quot;under assault&quot; more than he did.

Rewind to 1994. While everyone was worried about Clinton socializing health care, he was busy socializing mortgages. To boost minority homeownership, Clinton toughened anti-redlining rules and launched a federal assault on mortgage underwriting standards.

            <title>Fast Trains Sound Nice, But Who Will Ride?  9.23.11</title>
            <description>Boondoggles: How can we tell if Congress is serious about reining in spending? A clear-cut, permanent defunding of high-speed rail would be one sign. But the pipe dream won&apos;t quite die.

Sometime soon — or so we&apos;d like to think — the fast-train fad will fizzle out, the victim of fiscal sanity and critical thinking.

Just this week, a Senate Appropriations subcommittee controlled by Democrats actually voted to give high-speed rail nothing at all in the new fiscal year.

That got our hopes up. Then the full Appropriations Committee mixed the message by approving $100 million for the program, which is a far cry from the $8 billion sought by President Obama.

That pittance was a symbolic victory for the rail fans. It was a rebuke to the Republican-controlled House, which is trying to kill Obama&apos;s high-speed rail scheme once and for all. For those who think that sleek trains will somehow revolutionize transportation in America, it keeps the dream alive.

            <description>Economy: The head-scratching continues as stocks take another leg down. Why, they ask, must the market be so negative? With an economy buckling under leftist incompetence, what, we ask, is there to be positive about?

Funny, because it&apos;s been going on for almost three years now, but hardly a day goes by without some bit of bad news the media calls &quot;unexpected.&quot; But investors have noticed.

After selling off 2.9% on Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 dived another 3.2% Thursday. The Dow industrial average is testing a 52-week low.

            <title>Drill, Cuba, Drill   9.22.11</title>
            <description>Energy Policy: Deep-water drilling will resume in the Florida Strait when a giant, semi-submersible oil rig en route from Singapore arrives later this fall. The bad news is it will not be American.

While U.S. oil and energy prices &quot;necessarily skyrocket,&quot; as President Obama once said they would under energy policies that have imposed a de facto ban on offshore drilling, a massive Chinese-built semi-submersible oil rig is on its way from Singapore to a drilling position off northwest Cuba perhaps as little as 50 miles from Key West, Fla.

The long-predicted move could come as early as November, as Spanish oil giant Repsol YPF leads an international consortium that will operate the rig known as Scarabeo 9. It wants to wait until the hurricane season ends before it begins drilling.

            <description>Moral Hazard: The Solyndra scandal shows this White House is unprincipled. Still, it&apos;s providing another public service. It confirms that government loans create an environment of corruption.

Top executives from the California solar energy company will testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Friday.

The hope — at least in some quarters — is that they will answer questions about the administration&apos;s alleged attempt to obtain favorable treatment for the company, which has links to the White House.

            <title>The Fed&apos;s New &apos;Operation&apos; Is Twisted   9.21.11</title>
            <description>Economy: Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is reaching back 50 years for a &quot;trick&quot; to get the economy moving, but it won&apos;t work. Our problem today isn&apos;t monetary policy. It&apos;s government meddling.

The idea is simple: The Fed holds $1.7 trillion in Treasury debt. It wants to &quot;rebalance&quot; that by selling short-term debt and replacing it with long-term Treasuries. In theory, that would cut long-term interest rates, boosting investment in both housing and business.

Sounds good, but we&apos;ve tried it before, in 1961. The strategy — dubbed &quot;Operation Twist&quot; — was supposed to keep rates low and give the economy a badly needed shot in the arm.

Did it work? When Operation Twist began, the 10-year Treasury traded around 3.7%. By the middle of the next year, it was above 4% — and continued rising for most of the rest of the &apos;60s.

Even Bernanke, in a paper written seven years ago, termed Operation Twist a &quot;failure.&quot; So why should this time be any different? The answer is, it won&apos;t be.

More recently, Japan tried something quite similar — over and over — after it fell into a protracted slump in 1990. And, just as in the U.S., Japan&apos;s government tried repeated stimulus plans. It didn&apos;t work.

            <title>Thugs At The Trough   9.21.11</title>
            <description>Public Unions: President Obama told Illinois manufacturers last year, &quot;At a certain point, I do think you&apos;ve made enough money.&quot; Somehow that hectoring never reached his 23 union-boss allies now draining Illinois&apos; public coffers.

In a perfect piggy case of some are more equal than others, Wednesday&apos;s Chicago Tribune reported that the state&apos;s pension code enables 23 Chicago labor leaders to collect $56 million in pensions from Illinois&apos; hard-pressed taxpayers, plenty of whom include unionized workers and other ordinary people.

The sneaky provision was slipped into law in 1991 and came about with no cost analysis, no debate and not a single politician, union boss or lobbyist willing now to claim credit for the perk that enables former city employees to claim lavish pensions even though they spent most of their careers as union bosses.

It&apos;s a textbook argument for ridding the nation of public employee unions that have repeatedly fleeced workers and taxpayers to their own advantage.

            <title>Blinded By Green Light   9.21.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: The administration is bent on finalizing as many as 15 loan guarantees for green energy ventures before the stimulus deadline. How detached from reality can this White House be?

The administration is separated from the real world on two levels.

On one, the White House is operating as if there were no Solyndra scandal.

On the other, the White House acts as if its ideas are so brilliant that the laws of economics don&apos;t apply them.

Though the administration seems to be unaware, the Solyndra scandal is raging white hot. The executive branch&apos;s part in the process of the California solar panel maker securing a guaranteed loan is of great interest to the Treasury Department&apos;s inspector general, the Energy Department, a House committee and the FBI.

Even a few media outlets are covering the story. But from its Olympian perch, the White House is ignoring the fray.

At issue is a $535 million guaranteed federal loan made to Solyndra. The public deserves to know the White House used its influence to push the low-interest loan ahead for political purposes.

            <title>Solyndra Takes The Fifth   9.21.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: Two top executives of the bankrupt solar panel firm will refuse to answer questions about possible fraud and the waste of taxpayer dollars. Unlike oil execs, they and the administration have much to hide.

There&apos;s a delicious irony in the news that Solyndra&apos;s two top executives, Chief Executive Brian Harrison and Chief Financial Officer W.G. &quot;Bill&quot; Stover, plan to invoke their Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to answer questions when they testify Friday before a House Energy and Commerce Committee panel investigating their failed company, which got more than $500 million in federally backed loans.

It was only a few months ago when the executives of Exxon Mobil, Shell, ConocoPhillips, BP America and Chevron were summoned to appear before the Senate Finance Committee for what Sen. Orrin Hatch labeled a dog-and-pony show to defend their allegedly ill-gotten profits and tax breaks.

It didn&apos;t matter that they paid more than their share of taxes, ranking above most industries, or reinvested their profits to create a useful and reliable source of energy that created American jobs. They didn&apos;t need protection against self-incrimination, for they&apos;d broken no laws and squandered no taxpayer cash. They were just the black hats du jour for the greenies and progressive left.

They were just the black hats du jour for the greenies and progressive left.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Suit: Saudi Gov&apos;t Sponsored 9/11  9.21.11</title>
            <description>Justice: A new 9/11 lawsuit portrays the Saudi government as having more control over al-Qaida charities before the attacks than it (or the U.S.) has admitted. Let&apos;s hear the truth.

Lloyds of London seeks $215 million in damages from the kingdom to recover claims it paid 9/11 victims and their families. The suit charges that the Saudi government funded al-Qaida through its banks and charities.

The complaint, filed in U.S. court, states that without official Saudi sponsorship, &quot;al-Qaida would not have possessed the capacity to conceive, plan and execute the Sept. 11 attacks.&quot; In other words, absent Saudi support, the Twin Towers would still be standing — along with nearly 3,000 Americans.

We&apos;re impressed by the documentation cited in the 156-page complaint by Cozen O&apos;Conner, a major Washington law firm. It&apos;s much more detailed than the lawsuit brought on behalf of 9/11 families, which a federal judge dismissed for lack of evidence. This one might have a shot. It points to new intelligence, including recently leaked diplomatic cables.

            <description>Postal Politics: If the U.S. Postal Service were a regular business, it would be filing for bankruptcy protection about now. So why not let it do just that? You&apos;ll have to ask the unions for an answer to that one.

Article I of the Constitution says Congress shall have the power to &quot;establish post offices and post roads.&quot; There&apos;s nothing here about a jobs program, but that&apos;s roughly what the modern-day postal service has become.

Yes, it still carries out an essential task, as it did in the Founders&apos; era. But it could do that work with about two-thirds of its current workforce. That&apos;s the opinion of the Postal Service management, which is trying to run USPS like a business and not put new burdens on the taxpayers. The USPS unions, enjoying no-layoff contracts and rich benefits,think otherwise.

            <title>Saving State Gov&apos;t   9.20.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: Reformist Governors Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Mitch Daniels of Indiana both fixed their state budgets by committing the taboo of restricting collective bargaining. Their boldness is paying off.

The Manhattan Institute on Tuesday brought both into the belly of the public-sector labor union beast, New York City, and presented their war stories as models for other states.

With about 5.7 million residents, Wisconsin had a massive structural deficit of about $3.6 billion. Walker takes credit for using reform of the budget process to transform that into a surplus of about $300 million, with much of his $1.27 billion in state aid &quot;cuts&quot; actually ending up going to public schools.

            <description>Scandals: A gun dealer&apos;s tape shows a possible coverup of a third gun found at the scene of a murdered border patrol agent. Meanwhile, a second congressional witness reports coaching of testimony on a donor&apos;s project.

That giant sucking sound you hear is the Obama administration imploding under the weight of incompetent policies based on long-discredited progressive ideology and now a wave of scandals that involve gun-running, witness-tampering and political payoffs — and cover-ups of all of the above.

The infamous Watergate tape may have its rival in tapes obtained by CBS News between an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and a gun dealer who helped the ATF in its botched gun-running operation into Mexico known as &quot;Fast and Furious.&quot;

IBD&apos;s Sean Higgins reported last week that Solyndra, a Fremont, Calif.-based solar panel firm that went bust shortly after taking $527 million in federal loan guarantees, has applied for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 1,100 laid-off workers.

That $1.5 billion federal program is ostensibly for &quot;retraining&quot; for workers who have lost their jobs due to &quot;foreign trade.&quot;

            <description>United Nations: The planned vote on statehood for the Palestinians is more than just a bad diplomatic move. Though likely to be vetoed, it&apos;s an epic disaster for Israel, the U.S. and what remains of the West.

The proposal that will be put forward in the United Nations to make Palestine a full member of the U.N. — and thus, officially, a state — has overwhelming support from some 127 countries. But it&apos;s a dangerous idea that will lead to a new terrorist state in the Mideast and probably another war.

The noose of energy-states that surround Israel is tightening by the day.

            <description>Higher Ed: It&apos;s time for a tuition revolt, and higher taxes aren&apos;t the answer. Students and the rest of the public are now paying for decades of mission creep and bureaucratic bloat.

The regents of the University of California met this past week to revisit an old issue they&apos;ve never really dealt with well — how to cope with erratic (and usually dwindling) state aid.

Sooner or later, they&apos;ll probably raise tuition again, as they have in the past. But for now they are quailing at a plan, offered by UC&apos;s president, to raise students&apos; costs by at least 8%, and up to 16%, annually for the next four years. &quot;It scares the bejesus out of folks,&quot; said one of the regents, California&apos;s Lt.

            <itunes:summary>Higher Ed: It&apos;s time for a tuition revolt, and higher taxes aren&apos;t the answer. Students and the rest of the public are now paying for decades of mission creep and bureaucratic bloat.

The regents of the University of California met this past week to revisit an old issue they&apos;ve never really dealt with well — how to cope with erratic (and usually dwindling) state aid.

Sooner or later, they&apos;ll probably raise tuition again, as they have in the past. But for now they are quailing at a plan, offered by UC&apos;s president, to raise students&apos; costs by at least 8%, and up to 16%, annually for the next four years. &quot;It scares the bejesus out of folks,&quot; said one of the regents, California&apos;s Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Scandal: The Air Force&apos;s Space Command chief was pressured to alter testimony about the danger of a wireless project developed by a Democratic donor&apos;s company. Are lives as well as money being put at risk?

Crony capitalism, which has been rampant in President Obama&apos;s push for green energy, is one thing. Rewarding donors with stimulus dollars is merely the &quot;Chicago Way&quot; brought to Washington, D.C.

But when ideology combines with cronyism to place American lives and the nation&apos;s security at risk, it&apos;s quite another thing.

            <title>The U.S. Bails Out A Profligate EU    9.16.11</title>
            <description>Bailouts: Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner was dispensing advice in Europe Friday as the Fed began printing massive amounts of money to bail out the EU. Our government seems more worried about Europe than the U.S.

With Europe on the verge of another financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and European officials announced a three-stage &quot;liquidity&quot; program under which the U.S. central bank will supply dollars so Europe can buy its own bonds and keep the region&apos;s economy from going under.

Geithner and the Fed are doing in Europe just what they did here: printing huge amounts of dollars and using them to buy public debt, a kind of mega-stimulus.

This may stave off a collapse of Greece, or Italy, or Spain, for a while. But ultimately, it will fail. After the default of Greece and one or two other fiscal wastrels, the euro zone could collapse — with disastrous results.

Why? This mega-stimulus fails to address the euro zone&apos;s actual problem — just as $3 trillion in &quot;stimulus,&quot; TARP and Quantitative Easings I and II in the U.S. failed to address our problem: too much debt from too much spending.

            <title>AttackWatch Twits   9.16.11</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: You know a presidential campaign is going south when its detractors have more fun with its website than do its fans. That&apos;s the case with AttackWatch.com, the Obama site that&apos;s making him a parody.

According to the logic of AttackWatch.com — cue &quot;Jaws&quot; music — there&apos;s a vast, right-wing conspiracy out there determined to lie about the president and vote him out of office. Drastic steps are needed, and the comically menacing black-and-red AttackWatch website is the answer.

Calling on readers to &quot;Get the facts. Fight the Smears,&quot; about President Obama&apos;s record, the site actually encourages all Americans to become snitches for Obama. That mimics the 2008 Obama campaign&apos;s &quot;FightTheSmears.com&quot; site, as well as the George Soros-funded MediaMatters.com. AttackWatch asks readers to &quot;report&quot; the &quot;lies,&quot; presumably so the Obama team won&apos;t have to Google its own record.

On Twitter, this pompous, conspiracy-minded premise has managed only to attract an outburst of humor.

&quot;I saw a kid eating fries with his happy meal yesterday,&quot; tweeted someone signing himself NostraSeamus.

&quot;I did see the price of arugula at the supermarket today,&quot; tweeted Krackerjam.

            <title>The Spreading Green Jobs Scam  9.16.11</title>
            <description>Boondoggles: With a minimum of five green firms going bankrupt, taxpayers find themselves on the hook for at least one possibly illegal loan while paying ghastly sums for each green job created. We&apos;ve been sunburned.

As solar panel manufacturer Solyndra was sliding into a long-predicted bankruptcy, Energy Department officials began negotiations with the company and two of its main investors about restructuring its $535 million loan to keep afloat the business that was supposed to be a good investment.

Under the restructuring agreement, Solyndra&apos;s private investors were moved to the front of the line and taxpayers were put on the hook for at least the first $75 million if the company should default. Subordinating taxpayers to private investors in recovering loan money is an &quot;apparent violation of the law,&quot; according to Fred Upton, R-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

During hearings last week, Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and other Republicans noted that the Energy Policy Act of 2005 says obligations, or loan guarantees, shall not be subordinated to other financing.

            <description>Climate Change: Global warm-mongers say they can&apos;t name a single scientist who doesn&apos;t agree with them. Well, here&apos;s one: Nobel laureate Ivan Giaever, who just left a scientific society because he believes the debate isn&apos;t over.

We keep hearing from Al Gore and others that the debate is over, that the &quot;consensus&quot; is that man-made carbon dioxide emissions are heating the planet. The only scientists who don&apos;t believe in global warming, we are told, have been bought and paid for by big polluters.

So what do they do with Giaever? He won the Nobel Prize for physics in 1973 for his work on superconductors. He was a professor in the School of Engineering and School of Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. He also supported Barack Obama in his 2008 presidential campaign.

But the Norwegian scientist is no longer a member of the American Physical Society, the second-largest organization of physicists in the world. He resigned last week because he &quot;cannot live&quot; with the APS&apos; position that there is &quot;incontrovertible&quot; evidence that man&apos;s CO2 emissions are causing global warming.

Clearly, Giaever doesn&apos;t believe the debate is over.

            <description>Islamofacism: Quick: What would be the biggest casualty of a merger between the Saudis and two of the West&apos;s most influential media moguls? Answer: the truth.

Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal announced this week he will launch a pro-Islamist 24-hour news network with New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg&apos;s privately held news service.

The deal has Bloomberg News providing five hours of financial and economic news programming throughout the day on the new &quot;Alarab&quot; channel, which the prince says will be &quot;right of Al-Jazeera&quot; — that is, even more radical. It will no doubt promote Alwaleed&apos;s notoriously anti-Israel agenda.

The two reports out of the Labor Department are troubling enough on their own. Jobless claims hit 428,000 last week, up 11,000 from the week before, the highest level in months and, naturally, unexpected. And inflation in August was up 3.8% over last year, also higher than forecast.

These reports also point to a more worrisome trend. With unemployment stuck at a stratospheric 9.1% — and giving no signs of coming down soon — inflation is now climbing. The current annual rate is more than twice where it stood in January. Combine the two, and you have a Misery Index of 12.9 — up 21% this year and a stunning 64% since Obama took office.

            <title>Disband The Black Caucus   9.15.11</title>
            <description>Racial Politics: Next week, the Congressional Black Caucus will hold its 41st annual conference in Washington. It should be its last. The race-baiting group is alarmingly corrupt and out of control.

Founded in 1971 by 13 civil-rights leaders as &quot;the conscience of the Congress,&quot; the caucus has strayed far from its original mission. Now boasting 42 politicians — including some of the most radical and unethical in Congress — it chiefly serves its own interests.

Its lavish annual gala is an unseemly shakedown of corporate donors unwittingly funding a war chest for Marxist causes. While the living conditions of average African-Americans worsen, this elite black power club has empowered and enriched its own.

            <title>Alcohol, Tobacco And Murder   9.15.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: Weapons linked to ATF&apos;s &quot;Fast and Furious&quot; operation have been tied to at least eight violent crimes in Mexico, including three murders and four kidnappings. At least Solyndra doesn&apos;t have a body count.

Administration scandals are piling up fast and furious, no pun intended, but none is worse than the gun-running operation that operated under the umbrella title of Project Gunrunner. Fast and Furious, a deadly subset, gets deadlier by the day.

A letter dated Sept. 9 from Assistant Attorney General Ronald Welch sent to Rep. Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Sen. Charles Grassley, who&apos;s been looking into the scandal on the Senate side, provides what it acknowledges is an incomplete list of crimes made possible by guns allowed to &quot;walk&quot; into Mexico as part of the operation run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

            <title>EPA Regulations Still Killing Jobs   9.14.11</title>
            <description>Energy: A Dallas energy company closes two facilities due to a new regulation, costing hundreds of jobs. The president talks up his jobs bill while his administration creates rising unemployment and rolling blackouts.

When President Obama set aside, pending his re-election, proposed ozone national ambient air quality standards, he said it was in the interest &quot;of reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as our economy continues to recover.&quot; We have said regarding Obama that you should always keep your eye on what his other hand is doing.

On the same morning he announced his &quot;must pass&quot; jobs bill, a rehash of the failed stimulus, Texas energy company Luminant announced that new Environmental Protection Agency regulations were forcing it to close several facilities, resulting in the loss of 500 jobs and 1,200 megawatts of generating capacity.

The company cited the cross-state air-pollution rule in its decision to cease operations at two electricity-generating facilities and three coal mines. Texas utilities have been ordered by the EPA to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 47% from 2010 levels and nitrogen oxide by 8% and to do it by January. The head of the Texas Public Utility Commission says the rules could lead to rolling blackouts.

            <title>No Place For Gov&apos;t   9.14.11</title>
            <description>Health Care: Another federal judge has ruled that ObamaCare&apos;s individual mandate is unconstitutional. It&apos;s hard to see how a court could possibly decide any other way.

Presiding in Harrisburg, Pa., district court Judge Christopher Conner ruled Tuesday that the law&apos;s individual mandate that requires those who don&apos;t have health care insurance to buy it &quot;cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.&quot;

Conner, who is the third federal judge to overturn the law in part or in whole, reminded the Democrats of the elementary principles they ignored when they passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

&quot;The federal government ... is one of limited enumerated powers, and Congress&apos; efforts to remedy the ailing health care and health insurance markets must fit squarely within the boundaries of those powers,&quot; Conner wrote in his 52-page decision.

The administration&apos;s insistence that the individual mandate is authorized by the Constitution&apos;s Commerce Clause was rejected by Conner. Giving the mandate a &quot;constitutional blessing,&quot; he wrote, &quot;would effectively sanction Congress&apos; exercise of police power under the auspices of the Commerce Clause.&quot;

            <title>Solargate Unraveled   9.14.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: The White House pressured federal officials to OK a loan to an insolvent but politically tied green energy company in advance of a vice-presidential photo-op.

Corruption is not an energy policy. Emails released to the Washington Post before Wednesday&apos;s hearings on the $535 million stimulus loan guarantee issued to now-bankrupt Solyndra Inc. reveal the extent of, and resistance to, White House pressure to get the loan approved so Vice President Joe Biden could announce it at a Sept. 4, 2009, groundbreaking event.

The White House has denied applying pressure or even monitoring the review process, saying the stimulus loan guarantee was a good &quot;investment.&quot;

The emails show these statements to be false and that the White House knew Solyndra, whose major investor was Tulsa billionaire and Obama fundraiser George Kaiser, was at risk of going under.

The emails show White House officials repeatedly asking the Office of Management and Budget about progress on the loan review. One email from a budget official referred to &quot;the time pressure we are under to sign off on Solyndra&quot; and referred to &quot;a situation of having to do rushed approvals.&quot;

            <title>Obama&apos;s Jobs Bill Should Get The Pink Slip   9.14.11</title>
            <description>Stimulus: Maybe President Obama hasn&apos;t said &quot;pass this bill&quot; often enough in recent days, because most of the public, and many Democrats, aren&apos;t buying his latest so-called jobs plan. What do they know that Obama doesn&apos;t?

Since last Thursday, Obama has said &quot;pass this bill,&quot; or words to that effect, 90 times. That has to be some sort of record for presidential repetition. Yet the chances that Congress will actually heed his words grow slimmer by the day.

A new Bloomberg poll finds that 51% of the public doesn&apos;t think the president&apos;s &quot;jobs&quot; bill will cut the unemployment rate. Only 40% think it will. Worse for Obama, 56% of independents give his must-pass bill a thumbs down.

A separate National Journal poll found that just 16% think his plan will lower unemployment &quot;a lot,&quot; while 24% say it won&apos;t help at all. Obama himself got zero bounce from his big speech last week.

And while Obama is determined to blame Republicans for any failure to &quot;pass this bill&quot; (in North Carolina on Wednesday he said the GOP doesn&apos;t want to &quot;give me a win&quot;), it&apos;s members of his own party who are defecting.

As Politico reports, several moderate Democrats are &quot;far from sold&quot; on the plan. It quotes Sen. Jim Webb, D-Va., as calling the tax part of it &quot;terrible.&quot; And Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., told Politico that long-term deficit reduction would be &quot;better than everything else the president is talking about.&quot;

            <title>Loud And Clear, And Repeated   9.14.11</title>
            <description>Rebellion: The safest of Democratic congressional seats in the citadel of liberalism has gone conservative Republican. But it just continues the remarkable trend that began when voters realized the mistake they made in 2008.

How often do you have to shout before the message gets through: The American people vehemently oppose the program of massive government expansion and intrusion the Obama administration has undertaken.

Those who organized the first Tea Party events for April 15, 2009, get credit for the first populist rumblings.  They sent a shock wave to perhaps the nation&apos;s most liberal state in early 2010 when they helped Scott Brown take &quot;Ted Kennedy&apos;s seat&quot; in the U.S. Senate.

In November of 2010, the historic backlash against Obamaism rocked the Richter scale as Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House of Representatives, gaining majority control in the biggest loss for a party in House midterm elections since 1938.

On Tuesday came the latest chapter in the popular rising against big government.  In New York&apos;s 9th district — dependably Democratic since 1923 — businessman and TV programming creative whiz Bob Turner ran as an across-the-board conservative and beat liberal Democrat David Weprin by an astonishing 54% to 46%.

            <itunes:summary>Rebellion: The safest of Democratic congressional seats in the citadel of liberalism has gone conservative Republican. But it just continues the remarkable trend that began when voters realized the mistake they made in 2008.

How often do you have to shout before the message gets through: The American people vehemently oppose the program of massive government expansion and intrusion the Obama administration has undertaken.

Those who organized the first Tea Party events for April 15, 2009, get credit for the first populist rumblings.  They sent a shock wave to perhaps the nation&apos;s most liberal state in early 2010 when they helped Scott Brown take &quot;Ted Kennedy&apos;s seat&quot; in the U.S. Senate.

In November of 2010, the historic backlash against Obamaism rocked the Richter scale as Republicans picked up 63 seats in the House of Representatives, gaining majority control in the biggest loss for a party in House midterm elections since 1938.

On Tuesday came the latest chapter in the popular rising against big government.  In New York&apos;s 9th district — dependably Democratic since 1923 — businessman and TV programming creative whiz Bob Turner ran as an across-the-board conservative and beat liberal Democrat David Weprin by an astonishing 54% to 46%.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Editorial: &apos;Jobs Bill&apos; Is About Politics, Not Jobs   9.13.11</title>
            <description>Obamanomics: Government spending failed on jobs, so the president has shifted to Plan T: taxes, including limiting mortgage interest and other deductions — plus still more spending. His unlikely-to-pass plan is 100% politics.

When an angry Barack Obama repeatedly demanded at a joint session of Congress last week that lawmakers &quot;pass this jobs bill,&quot; he knew their answer would be no. But at the time, no one outside the White House knew the game the president was playing.

In one of the most deceitful ploys ever attempted against the American people, President Obama kept it to himself that he was planning a full-frontal assault on tax deductions to &quot;pay for&quot; nearly $450 billion in new stimulus.

            <title>Jobs Bill For Lawyers   9.13.11</title>
            <description>Litigation: Buried in the president&apos;s American Jobs Act is a provision that will do nothing to encourage hiring and much to discourage it. Unless, that is, you&apos;re a law firm looking for new ways to sue companies.

On a radio show recently, the president complained that companies are discriminating against the unemployed, and that this &quot;makes absolutely no sense.&quot;

Leave it to Obama — someone with zero business experience — to lecture companies about what does and doesn&apos;t make sense when it comes to hiring. But what makes &quot;no sense&quot; is his charge that companies are &quot;discriminating&quot; against the unemployed in the first place.

            <description>Economy: The data are in, and they aren&apos;t pretty: The economy continues to fall apart, with seemingly little immediate hope for a turnaround. If you were looking for a referendum on the failures of Obamanomics, this is it.

New data from the Census Bureau show just how badly things have gone since President Obama confidently strode into office in January 2009. For a country as wealthy as America, the economic degradation is shocking:

• Poverty hit a 17-year high in 2010, jumping to 15.1% from 14.3% in 2009. Some 46.2 million Americans were poor last year, the most ever in the 52 years that such data have been kept.

            <description>Bureaucracy: The Transportation Security Administration was set up to close the gaps that allowed 9/11 to happen. But it quickly went bad, a fact its founder now acknowledges. He and others should have known better.

Republican Rep. John Mica of Florida wrote the legislation that created the TSA. But nearly a decade later, he&apos;s not happy with what the agency has deteriorated into.

&quot;The whole program has been hijacked by bureaucrats,&quot; Mica recently told Human Events.

&quot;It mushroomed into an army,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s gone from a couple-billion-dollar enterprise to close to $9 billion.&quot;

            <description>Spending: One lone senator stands up against the budget &quot;supercommittee&quot; doing what no enemy has ever accomplished — rendering the arsenal of democracy impotent and defenseless. Why is defense being singled out?

On the Thursday before the nation mourned its dead from the largest terrorist attack on the United States, the specially selected &quot;supercommittee&quot; of six senators and six congressmen met for the first time to do the job for which 535 of them had been elected but had failed to do — make the budget cuts that were part of the debt ceiling deal.

Failure by this 12-member Joint Committee of Congress to come up with $1.5 trillion in cuts would trigger an automatic across-the-board sequestration process that would make half the cuts at the expense of the defense of this nation. Either way, defense gets hit hard, since these cuts come on top of $350 billion in defense cuts already announced.

            <description>Science: Al Gore&apos;s Current TV will use 24 straight hours of airtime this week to try to convert global warming skeptics. Will he mention a recent report that shows the climate change scare is grossly overblown?

And we also doubt that anyone else connected with the sympathetic media will. The CERN report, which we covered on this page two weeks ago, has been largely ignored by the mainstream press.

Had the European Organization for Nuclear Research (known by its French acronym, CERN) report bolstered the conjecture that man-made carbon dioxide emissions are warming the planet, the story would have gone above the fold in newspapers and led the network TV news. The tone of the stories would have been dire.

The White House has to do more than just make phone calls and statements of concern. Yet that&apos;s all it did when Egypt&apos;s police and army last week let a mob sack Israel&apos;s embassy in Cairo following a flare-up on the Egyptian border.

Terrorists trekked across Egypt&apos;s Sinai Peninsula and sneaked into Israel, killing eight Israelis. In response to the attack, Israel killed five Egyptian police and soldiers along with the insurgents.

It is a scenario worthy of Hollywood, but it is a frighteningly real possibility. A solitary ballistic missile, perhaps an ICBM launched by a decaying North Korean regime or an Iranian mullah, or a terrorist Scud launched from a ship off the Atlantic Coast carrying the first Islamic nuke, detonates its warhead 25 to 300 miles above the U.S. mainland.</itunes:summary>

            <description>National Security: The Sept. 11 commission stated that our biggest failure was one of imagination. Imagine an Iranian nuclear device detonating high over the American heartland. They&apos;re working on it.

On the same day the 9/11 Commission issued its report, another commission issued a report on a threat that could change our world and way of life in ways we can scarcely imagine. It is a real and credible threat, and it is largely being ignored.

The threat is a phenomenon known as electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, and demonstrates why the issue of homeland security extends beyond the need for body scanners or taking our shoes off at the airport. It&apos;s why ignoring Iran is dangerous and why a robust national missile defense should be of the highest priority.

This threat to our national security was the subject of study by the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, established by unanimous consent of the House and Senate. Released on the same day as the 9/11 Commission report, few paid attention.

This threat to our national security was the subject of study by the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, established by unanimous consent of the House and Senate. Released on the same day as the 9/11 Commission report, few paid attention.

It is a scenario worthy of Hollywood, but it is a frighteningly real possibility. A solitary ballistic missile, perhaps an ICBM launched by a decaying North Korean regime or an Iranian mullah, or a terrorist Scud launched from a ship off the Atlantic Coast carrying the first Islamic nuke, detonates its warhead 25 to 300 miles above the U.S. mainland.</itunes:summary>

            <title>The President&apos;s Old, New Jobs Program   9.9.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: President Obama&apos;s jobs program is disappointing, to put it mildly. Given our economic troubles, this heavily politicized rehash of failed policies is a slap in the face to 27 million Americans without full-time jobs.

In an angry speech clearly intended to rally his demoralized troops, the president on Thursday unveiled a $457 billion jobs plan that was touted as &quot;new,&quot; but really just recycles past failed policies.

Looking at markets&apos; responses around the world, including a 304-point nose dive on the Dow, his cynical message doesn&apos;t seem to be selling well. And indeed, it&apos;s shocking to behold a leader who, three years into a presidency, seems oblivious to the harsh reality of his policy failures. But that&apos;s what we got Thursday.

The new spending, the targeted tax cuts for some and the much higher taxes on the successful have all been tried before. It was called &quot;stimulus.&quot; It entailed massive borrowing and spending. It didn&apos;t work.

And it won&apos;t work now. Take Obama&apos;s plan to give $4,000 in tax credits &quot;if&quot; a company hires someone who&apos;s been unemployed for six months. What business will hire a permanent worker for $50,000 a year for a one-time credit of $4,000? This is just plain foolish.

            <title>A 9/11 Shame    9.9.11</title>
            <description>Politics: With an ultraliberal New York congressional seat about to go Republican, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ran a TV ad politicizing the 9/11 attacks. Will its chairman accept responsibility?

It took a long, long time for disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner to admit he sent out lewd photos of his private parts, and even longer for him to resign. In trying to stop the impending disaster the Democratic Party is faced with in the special election for Weiner&apos;s Brooklyn/Queens district, Steve Israel, head of the House&apos;s Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ignited another scandal that ought to mean his resignation.

Just days before the 10th anniversary of hijacked airliners flying into the Twin Towers, murdering thousands, Israel&apos;s DCCC released a television commercial showing GOP candidate Bob Turner&apos;s jet buzzing the Manhattan skyline, spreading destruction by seeking to &quot;cut benefits for Medicare and Social Security.&quot;

The ad was pulled after an uproar began within hours, but it&apos;s hard for Israel to claim he wasn&apos;t intentionally evoking 9/11 — especially since New York&apos;s 9th congressional district doesn&apos;t even include any of Manhattan.

The excuse that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi&apos;s handpicked fundraiser removed the commercial doesn&apos;t cut it. The controversy that Israel&apos;s 9/11 desecration has generated means that lots more people are now seeing the DCCC&apos;s new, expurgated version of the ad, and a lot of 9th district residents are taking in its attacks on Turner. Were those Israel&apos;s intentions all along?

            <title>Unanswered: What Was Saudis&apos; Role?    9.9.11</title>
            <description>9/11: A new report revealing the hijackers met in Florida with a well-connected Saudi family who fled to Riyadh just days before the attacks raises fresh concerns about the Saudis&apos; role in the plot.

The Saudi hijackers who entered the country from San Diego also met with Saudi handlers. So now we know al-Qaida had Saudi help from coast to coast. According to the Miami Herald, investigators believe the wealthy family at a minimum knew of their guests&apos; evil plans, and possibly aided them.

Just two weeks before 9/11, and after meetings and calls with ringleader Mohamed Atta and other hijackers, the Saudi nationals abandoned three cars, including a new Chrysler PT Cruiser, in the garage and driveway of their Sarasota home. In their haste to leave the country, they also left behind opulent furniture. A safe, however, was cleaned out. They also took a computer.

Their Sarasota home was owned by Esam Ghazzawi, a Saudi financier. He&apos;d been on an FBI watch list for terror-fundraising. The FBI, however, never briefed the 9/11 Commission about his and the other Saudi occupants&apos; connections to the hijackers. Congress also was left in the dark about the house search.

It&apos;s one of many mysteries surrounding the Saudis and 9/11. Other questions still unanswered after 10 years:

            <title>Editorial: GOP Shows Healthy Disregard For 3rd Rail   9.8.11</title>
            <description>Election: Social Security, long considered the &quot;third rail&quot; of U.S. politics, seems to have lost its power of shock. At Wednesday&apos;s GOP debate, candidates began to present serious ideas for reforming this system before it crashes.

That represents a sea change compared to the last three decades, when any politician who dared to bring up the parlous state of Social Security&apos;s financing would be charged with &quot;pushing grandma off a cliff&quot; by special interests seeking to scare seniors.

Those days are over. Candidates like Rick Perry and Herman Cain now fearlessly bringing Social Security to the fore as a top campaign issue.

            <description>Election &apos;12: Mainstream media have outrageously relegated Michele Bachmann to second-tier status in the GOP presidential race. But Wednesday&apos;s debate showed that in many ways, she rises above all the competition.

Of the eight Republican presidential candidates debating at the presidential library of the man who won the Cold War, only one mentioned the gravest threat facing the world today.

That candidate was Rep. Michele Bachmann. Asked about the military role of the U.S. in the world, Bachmann warned that &quot;the biggest issue in the Middle East&quot; is &quot;a nuclear Iran&quot; and that Barack Obama has &quot;put us more at risk than at any time.&quot;

            <description>The Fed: In what might be called a &quot;half-a-loaf speech,&quot; Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke shows he at least gets why our economy&apos;s in such lousy shape. But in the same talk, he misdiagnoses who&apos;s to blame and what to do about it.

So why are we having such a bad time right now? Well, the slowest recovery ever is a result of a much deeper than average correction in the housing market. Because of the financial system&apos;s enormous exposure to the massive buildup in housing debt, a severe financial crisis swept the globe after home prices fell in 2007 and 2008.

The reverberations of this are still being felt.

            <description>Corruption: In the same week a green energy firm that wasted hundreds of millions in taxpayer dollars said it was bankrupt, the White House made a multimillion-dollar loan to another solar power project. Madness reigns.

Last week, Solyndra, which builds industrial solar panels in the Bay Area, announced that it was filing for bankruptcy. The company, whose officials and investors visited the White House at least 20 times and have donated to the Obama campaign, chewed through 1,100 employees and piles of other people&apos;s money, including $535 million provided by taxpayers, before it finally succumbed to reality.

President Obama, who can&apos;t let go of his party&apos;s eco-energy fantasy, toured Solyndra&apos;s Fremont, Calif., plant last year. He identified the company as an example of the &quot;positive impacts&quot; of his stimulus plan and called it &quot;a testament to American ingenuity and dynamism.&quot; The president and the thinkers in his administration dreaming of a green economy merrily claimed Solyndra would eventually employ 4,000.

            <title>Enough With The Deficit-Fueled Stimulus   9.7.11</title>
            <description>Jobs: In his speech Thursday, the president is expected to announce a stimulus 2.0 package said to cost $300 billion. But why should anyone expect this to work any better than the $4 trillion in stimulus already in the economy?

When industrialist John D. Rockefeller was asked how much money is enough, his now-famous answer was: &quot;Just a little bit more.&quot; That, apparently, is also Obama&apos;s answer to stimulus spending.

After an $830 billion &quot;economic recovery&quot; plan, two auto bailouts, cash for clunkers, mortgage bailouts and at least two subsequent jobs programs, Obama wants to convince the country that just a little bit more stimulus is what the economy needs to finally get back on track.

But wait a minute. Since Obama took office, the government has run up $4 trillion in deficits. And even before his newest stimulus package, he&apos;s on track to add another $973 billion next year.

Unless Keynes&apos; was wrong, shouldn&apos;t all that have superturbocharged the economy by now? We&apos;re not talking about a little bit of extra spending, but record amounts.

            <title>It&apos;s Going To Hurt    9.7.11</title>
            <description>Medical Spending: Yet another study finds that ObamaCare is going to increase costs. And this one wasn&apos;t issued by an opponent of the Democrats&apos; reforms. In fact, one of its authors is an ObamaCare apologist.

In an effort to determine how ObamaCare would affect Wisconsin, the state&apos;s Health Services Department commissioned Gorman Actuarial and economist Jonathan Gruber from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to assess the program.

The review was ordered up by former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, a faithful ObamaCare supporter who has claimed the law will control health care costs. He now probably wishes he hadn&apos;t asked for the analysis.

Under its &quot;Key Findings&quot; heading, the report says the market for individual policies &quot;will experience premium increases as compared to pre-reform premiums.&quot;

&quot;Prior to the application of tax subsidies, 87% of the individual market will experience an average premium increase of 41%,&quot; says the report. &quot;The average increase for the entire individual market will be 30%.&quot;

            <title>A White House &apos;Gunrunner&apos;?   9.7.11</title>
            <description>The Law: Operation Gunwalker, the rogue ATF operation to arm Mexico&apos;s cartels, extends now to three White House officials. A bell goes off with the one named Dan Restrepo.

Late last Friday, CBS News and the Los Angeles Times almost buried the news that Restrepo, the National Security Council&apos;s top man for Latin America, and two other officials, were in on ATF memos from the Gunwalker operation called &quot;Fast and Furious.&quot;

That blows apart White House claims that it had no idea the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives was encouraging frontmen for Mexico&apos;s cartels to buy weapons from U.S. gun dealers — to &quot;trace&quot; them afterward.

Some 2,000 U.S. guns were sold in Gunwalker but simply disappeared — until they turned up at massacres in Mexico and at the murder scenes of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent Jaime Zapata.

But outgoing ATF acting director Ken Melson and others who&apos;ve been the fall guys in this scandal darkly hint that their orders came from the White House, and domestic critics think Gunwalker can only be explained as a White House bid to boost support for gun control. Restrepo&apos;s involvement distinctly raises both possibilities.

            <title>Was Rick Perry Al Gore&apos;s &apos;Cheerleader&apos;?  9.7.11</title>
            <description>Politics: In a new campaign ad, Ron Paul questions the bona fides of the Texas governor as a true GOP conservative, charging he once turned his back on the Reagan revolution. The truth is somewhat different.

Back in 1988 Rick Perry, now a 2012 presidential contender and three-term GOP governor of Texas, was a Democrat. He acknowledges that, just as President Reagan acknowledged that he too had been a Democrat who did not leave his former party so much as it left him.

Nearly a quarter-century ago and before, there was such an animal, now endangered if not totally extinct, as a conservative Democrat. Rick Perry was one and Al Gore, before he invented the Internet and discovered drowning polar bears, was considered one as well.

The charge leveled against Perry, most recently in a campaign ad by Rep. Ron Paul, also from Texas, is that while Reagan was a casual Democrat, Perry was a &quot;cheerleader&quot; for Gore who turned his back on what was considered George H.W. Bush&apos;s run for &quot;Reagan&apos;s third term.&quot; Some have charged Perry with actually running Gore&apos;s 1988 campaign in Texas.

            <description>Election &apos;12: At more than 150 pages, Mitt Romney&apos;s long-winded &quot;jobs plan&quot; is an attempt to portray him as the candidate of substance. Unfortunately, it&apos;s more a pondering than a plan.

Former Massachusetts Gov. Romney, who until the recent entry of Texas Gov. Rick Perry was the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, is taking a key lesson from Bill Clinton&apos;s 1992 campaign playbook.

With &quot;the economy, stupid&quot; being the prevailing issue for voters, and then-President George H.W. Bush widely considered detached from people&apos;s problems, Clinton published a lengthy &quot;National Economic Strategy.&quot;

Then the Arkansas governor rendered Democratic rivals impotent by unceasingly telling interviewers, debate moderators, and town hall crowds that &quot;I&apos;m the only person running who&apos;s got a plan to do something about the fix we&apos;re in.&quot;

            <description>Fiscal Policy: President Obama&apos;s much-anticipated jobs package reportedly costs hundreds of billions more in make-work temp jobs and food-stamp stimulus. He still doesn&apos;t get it.

Those remedies didn&apos;t work last time — the unemployment rate is now higher, to say nothing of the debt — and they won&apos;t work this time.

Americans have grown weary of Obama&apos;s warmed-over Keynesian ideas. Polls show that seven in 10 think he&apos;s steering the economy the wrong way; while four in 10 agree that he has &quot;no idea&quot; how to create jobs.

Instead of consulting with James Hoffa and other union bosses, he should listen to CEOs — the folks who actually make payroll. Here are several measures they say will incentivize them to hire permanent employees for jobs that will pay for themselves:

            <title>Editorial: Blaming Banks For Gov&apos;t Failure    9.6.11</title>
            <description>Capital: Washington&apos;s $30 billion shakedown suit against already weak banks is a dangerous move. It could push some banks off a cliff only to have to bail them out all over again.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency on Friday sued 17 big banks to recover as much as $30 billion in losses from subprime securities owned by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Financial stocks are under pressure. Investors worry the industry faces a long slog of litigation due to toxic loans.

Banks already have been hit by class-action lawsuits over subprime securities. Adding to woes, states are negotiating a deal in their own shakedown of Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup and others. They want them to pay at least $20 billion to help bail out homeowners facing foreclosure. Many of the attorneys general have been working with Obama officials.

            <description>Incivility: Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa Jr. introduced President Obama to union hordes by declaring war on the Tea Party and offering him an army against Republicans. Why no condemnation from &quot;The Great Uniter&quot;?

When President Obama held a rally at a sports arena in Tucson in January after a madman went on a shooting spree that maimed Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., and killed a federal judge and a civic-minded 9-year-old girl, he called for &quot;more civility in our public discourse.&quot;

&quot;We should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and Gabby Giffords, who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans, and that we can question each other&apos;s ideas without questioning each other&apos;s love of country and that our task, working together, is to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the American Dream to future generations.&quot;

&quot;We should be civil because we want to live up to the example of public servants like John Roll and Gabby Giffords, who knew first and foremost that we are all Americans, and that we can question each other&apos;s ideas without questioning each other&apos;s love of country and that our task, working together, is to constantly widen the circle of our concern so that we bequeath the American Dream to future generations.&quot;</itunes:summary>

            <title>Why The Bias Matters    9.6.11</title>
            <description>Journalism: That the media reek of liberal bias has been proved so many times in so many ways it&apos;s now axiomatic. Less certain is whether that bias affects public opinion. Now comes a study that says it does — big time.

How big? Well, if not for the bias that benefits Democrats, Barack Obama would still be running for re-election — only the office to which he&apos;d be seeking re-election would not be the presidency but the United States Senate.

That is to say, Sen. John McCain would have won the 2008 presidential election — and by a near-landslide 56% to 42% — instead of losing 53% to 46%.

            <description>Corruption: A top bundler and major investor in a now-bankrupt green company made multiple White House visits before he got a guaranteed stimulus loan that the administration monitored to ensure it was granted.

During the Clinton administration, when the Lincoln Bedroom in the White House became a favorite place for campaign contributors to rest their weary wallets, the infamous Johnny Chung made the observation that the White House was like a subway turnstile. You put your token in and you got inside.

Getting inside the White House was easy for billionaire investor George Kaiser, who made multiple visits to the White House and appeared at White House events next to administration officials. One of the prime investors in the green energy company Solyndra, Kaiser put quite a few tokens in the White House turnstile.

            <title>No New Jobs Means No New Growth    9.2.11</title>
            <description>Employment: Friday&apos;s report that the economy netted no new jobs in August was more than another nasty news bit. It suggests we may be slipping back into a recession as Democrats double down on failure.

Zero net new jobs last month and a downward revision of 58,000 jobs in the preceding two months are bad enough. So is the 9.1% unemployment rate, unchanged from July. But perhaps most worrisome, the data suggest an economy sputtering beyond its ability to create enough jobs.

Two numbers from the Labor Department&apos;s report now show that GDP may well be taking a dive.

Aggregate hours worked, a proxy for real GDP used by Wall Street economists, fell in August from July and has fallen a third of a percent since May. And those lucky enough to still have jobs saw their wages drop. Weekly earnings in August averaged $789.68, down $3.34 from the month before.

It&apos;s hard to show any GDP growth at all when both earnings and the number of hours worked are shrinking.

Then there was this cheery tidbit from a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond: &quot;After a long period of unemployment, affected workers may become effectively unemployable.&quot;

This is especially bad news, since 43% of the 14 million Americans without jobs last month had been unemployed for at least six months. Add those who want work but have given up looking, and joblessness soars to 16.2%.

            <title>Cost Of Clean Air   9.2.11</title>
            <description>Regulation: In some good news for a change, the federal rules machine that continuously throws up roadblocks to economic growth has missed a beat. Now for the bad news: The machine&apos;s still running.

On the Friday before Labor Day, a moment he hoped his green constituency would be too busy celebrating the workers of the world to hear the news, President Obama withdrew drafted rules intended to cut smog levels.

The regulation would have limited ground-level ozone to between 60 and 70 parts per billion. That&apos;s down from the 75 parts per billion, which was good enough in March 2008, when the Bush administration last set new ozone rules, and the 80 parts per billion set by the Clinton White House.

The green lobby pretends the environmental rules it peddles don&apos;t hurt the economy. Yet we have an implicit admission from a president tied to that lobby that the economic benefits of scuttling a regulation are greater than the regulation&apos;s ecological benefits.

Obama said he set aside proposed Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards in the interest &quot;of reducing regulatory burdens and regulatory uncertainty, particularly as our economy continues to recover.&quot;

The smog rule was one of seven new regulations the White House acknowledges would cost more than $1 billion each year. This particular regulation is projected to cost from $19 billion to as much as $90 billion a year.

            <title>A $4.2 Bil Subsidy For Illegals?   9.2.11</title>
            <description>The Law: If the federal government had actually wanted to encourage illegal immigration, wouldn&apos;t a big tax credit be the way to bring them in? Lucky us, that&apos;s what the IRS is doing — and with our money.

A blistering Treasury Department audit released Friday found that &quot;individuals not authorized to work in the United States were paid $4.2 billion in refundable credits.&quot; Those credits are meant to zero out any taxes paid by the poor, and often amount to checks as high as $1,000, courtesy of other taxpayers.

In the last five years, some 2.3 million illegal immigrants decided they, too, were &quot;entitled&quot; to that money, and the IRS paid them. Word got out and the payouts to illegals grew fourfold over the last five years.

The Treasury report noted that paying these credits to illegals is explicitly prohibited by U.S. law, which holds that those unauthorized to work here cannot receive federal benefits.

The IRS claims it&apos;s not its job to check the immigration status of those requesting U.S. money (easily done if a filer has a valid Social Security number instead of a &quot;taxpayer ID&quot;).

The tax agency apparently thinks laws only apply to people it audits — not politically sensitive illegal aliens.

            <description>Education: Paying teachers $150,000 salaries will transform public schools, promises Education Secretary Arne Duncan. Would a better-paid crew have saved the Titanic as it was sinking?

In a recent address titled &quot;Working Toward &apos;Wow,&apos;&quot; delivered to the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards, Arne Duncan declared that public school teachers &quot;should be earning a lot more money — as much as $150,000 per year.&quot;

Duncan began with a fantasy from a newspaper cartoon in which superstar athletes are &quot;standing around waiting to get an autograph from a short, balding guy. One player points to him and says, &apos;I wish I had that kind of money and respect.&apos; Another athlete points to the man and says, &apos;Wow! A teacher!&apos;&quot;

As loaded as LeBron James and Peyton Manning may be, with their incomes in the tens of millions of dollars, they and their fellow sports stars can&apos;t boast receiving a $10 billion bailout from the taxpayers last year, as public school teachers can.

            <title>Will This &apos;Major&apos; Jobs Speech Be Any Different Than Others?   9.2.11</title>
            <description>Economy: Democrats hope the president will deliver big, bold ideas in his much-hyped jobs speech. But why should this one be different from his other &quot;major&quot; jobs speeches that consisted only of stale, failed ideas?

For more than two years the president has been giving &quot;important&quot; jobs speeches — and no wonder. After an $830 billion stimulus and multiple &quot;jobs&quot; bills since, the employment picture has only deteriorated. The economy added zero jobs in August, and 2.4 million fewer people work today than when Obama took office.

Yet despite the advance billing on all those previous speeches, none was anything remotely &quot;bold&quot; or &quot;imaginative,&quot; something Democratic lawmakers and Obama&apos;s liberal media cheerleaders are now hoping for with his next one.

Instead, in every speech, Obama simply dusted off the same crabbed list — more money for roads and &quot;clean energy,&quot; various temporary tax credits, more unemployment insurance, temporary payroll tax cuts — despite the fact that each has already been tried on his watch, and all proved to be expensive failures. A rundown:

            <description>Politics: Liberals and their water-carriers in the media are trying mightily to characterize Republican front-runner Rick Perry as less intelligent than the president they&apos;re bent on re-electing. But who are the dumb ones here?

Denigrating an opponent&apos;s intelligence is one way progressives like to work as they follow the &quot;Rules for Radicals&quot; that Saul Alinsky set out for those who wish to seize power on behalf of the left. Followers of the Chicago Marxist include President Obama.

One rules says: &quot;Ridicule is man&apos;s most potent weapon. It&apos;s hard to counterattack ridicule, and it infuriates the opposition, which then reacts to your advantage.&quot;

            <title>Cuba&apos;s Terror Smoking Gun   9.1.11</title>
            <description>Terrorism: For years, Cuba&apos;s apologists have debunked U.S. warnings of Havana&apos;s sponsorship of terror. It withers in the face of news that Cuba has just set up a Hezbollah base.

According to a report in Italy&apos;s respected Corriere della Sera Wednesday, three Hezbollah terrorists operating out of Mexico have left that country to establish a permanent &quot;bridgehead&quot; to the communist island, calling their clandestine operation &quot;The Caribbean Dossier.&quot;

Twenty-three other terrorists from the Iran-linked terror group are expected to join the operation, which has a startup budget of more than $500,000. Corriere reported that the mission in Cuba is to provide logistical support for upcoming terrorist attacks planned in the hemisphere.

            <description>Power Sources: A solar panel manufacturer touted by the president as a symbol of his successful green energy policies files for bankruptcy and cuts a thousand green jobs. Maybe its time to drill, baby, drill.

During a visit to Solyndra Inc.&apos;s Fremont, Calif., facility in spring of 2010, President Obama boasted of what the company was going to do with the $535 million in loan guarantees his stimulus package provided.

&quot;We can see the positive impacts right here at Solyndra,&quot; he said. &quot;Through the Recovery Act, this company received a loan to expand its operations. This new factory is the result of those loans.&quot;

            <title>Obama Gives Free Rein To Union Thugs   8.31.11</title>
            <description>Workers&apos; Freedom: A departing Obama administration bureaucrat just made the forcible unionization of American workers a lot easier. When it comes to bullying, this president has a double standard.

To do something about kids in school getting shoved around, the White House sends the first lady onto the Ellen Show to bemoan the supposed &quot;culture of bullying&quot; in America.

But when it comes to those kids&apos; hard-working fathers and mothers struggling for a paycheck amid 9.1% unemployment, President Obama is only too happy to see them bullied at the hands of labor thugs.

Wilma Liebman, who has worked as a lawyer for big labor- and union-coddling government agencies unceasingly since 1974, left behind quite a present for her benefactors Sunday as she ended her chairmanship of the National Labor Relations Board. Included in a series of pro-union decisions was the bureaucratic enactment of &quot;Card Check&quot; over the heads of Congress.

Card Check means that if union forces can get most employees within a workplace to sign a card requesting a unionization election, the opposite happens: A secret ballot of workers is actually prohibited, and the union automatically comes into being — even if most workers oppose being unionized.

            <title>All In The President&apos;s Illegal Family   8.31.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: With two relatives having successfully defied deportation orders, President Obama needs to explain once again his relaxation and disregard of the immigration laws he swore to uphold and enforce.

We are great believers in individual responsibility, and certainly other presidents have had relatives with less-than-stellar reputations. Jimmy Carter had his brother Billy, and Bill Clinton had his brother Roger.

They were responsible for their own actions and idiosyncrasies. But presidents are responsible for upholding the nation&apos;s laws, even if they are violated by presidential relatives.

On Aug. 24, President Obama&apos;s uncle Omar Onyango was arrested by Framingham, Mass., police for driving under the influence of alcohol, running his SUV through a stop sign, narrowly avoiding a police cruiser and — a tragedy repeated too often these days — averting the killing of American citizens by illegal aliens who should not be here.

We pause to ask how it is possible for Onyango to have resided illegally in the U.S. for decades and, after being ordered deported in 1982, to have secured a job, a Massachusetts driver&apos;s license and a federal Social Security number, all without being detected or apprehended by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

            <title>An Accountable U.N. At Long Last?   8.31.11</title>
            <description>Politics: The United Nations has long been a font of waste, corruption, fraud and anti-Americanism. Always in need of &quot;reform,&quot; it&apos;s never happened. But a House bill may change that, and it can&apos;t pass soon enough.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairwoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen introduced a 153-page bill Tuesday to gradually defund the U.N. until it lives up to its goals and accounts for its actions.

Seems the fat checks coming in from U.S. taxpayers have given the U.N. the idea it can be as anti-American as its dollars allow, especially with the &quot;leading from behind&quot; crowd in the White House going along. Ros-Lehtinen&apos;s proposal has teeth and deserves to be passed.

H.R. 2829 will make U.S. funding &quot;voluntary&quot; rather than based on what the U.N. itself &quot;assesses.&quot; Passage means the U.N. won&apos;t be able to spit in the face of its largest donor without consequences. That&apos;s fair to taxpayers, of course, and U.N. bureaucrats will scream.

It&apos;s about time they did. The U.N.&apos;s latest stunt is to make Palestine a state and voting member without requiring it to admit Israel&apos;s right to exist. That proposal, coming up in the fall, stands to upset the balance of power in the Middle East, bankroll terror, put U.N. muscle behind a new rogue state and isolate Israel.

            <title>Investors Matter   8.31.11</title>
            <description>Business: A poll has found that nearly two of three Americans think the primary objective of a company is to create jobs. This gross misunderstanding needs to be cleared up.

A Rasmussen survey taken Aug. 20 and 21 found that 64% of the country thinks that the most basic goal of businesses is &quot;to create jobs for the overall economy.&quot; Only 25% of the 1,000 respondents got the question right and knew the &quot;primary objective of a business&quot; is &quot;to create value for the shareholders.&quot;

Americans need jobs. But businesses are not charities established simply to employ people. Businesses have to create wealth for investors or those businesses will cease to exist.

A company that focuses on hiring without concern for profit would soon go out of business. No one goes into business or runs one simply to employ workers. Everyone goes into business or manages one to make money.

Companies exist for one reason: Someone invested in a promising idea. This investment can be from a group of shareholders providing the company&apos;s financial capital. Or it can come from a person or a group that invests their savings and labor.

            <title>Editorial: Romney&apos;s Doomed &apos;3rd Rail&apos; Attack On Perry    8.30.11</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: Mitt Romney reportedly intends to use the &quot;third rail of politics&quot; — touch Social Security and you die — to kill Rick Perry. But the winning strategy next year may be something novel for politicians: the truth.

For unexplained reasons, Mitt Romney&apos;s people in New Hampshire told former George W. Bush speechwriter Marc Thiessen about their grand strategy to defeat Texas Gov. Rick Perry — and the plan couldn&apos;t be more out of sync with the anger currently raging at the Republican grassroots.

&quot;Romney strategists are quick to note that in his book, &apos;Fed Up!,&apos; Perry writes that &apos;By any measure, Social Security is a failure&apos; and calls the program &apos;something we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now&apos; that was created &apos;at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government,&apos;&quot; Thiessen wrote in the Washington Post on Monday.

            <description>The Press: A rat-fight between WikiLeaks operatives has exposed and threatened thousands of confidential U.S. diplomatic sources. Aside from the new blood on WikiLeaks&apos; hands, are its media enablers proud of themselves?

The internal disintegration of WikiLeaks, an Internet ring that traffics in stolen documents, was to be expected. Pirates slaughter each other over booty, and WikiLeaks is all about piracy.

WikiLeaks ringleader Julian Assange fell out out with his now-ex-spokesman, Daniel Domscheit-Berg, who then made off with 134,000 stolen secret State Department cables illegally obtained by WikiLeaks.

            <description>Border: An administration that conducts raids looking for illegal wood rather than illegal aliens signs partnerships with foreign governments to advise these aliens of their rights. What part of &quot;illegal&quot; don&apos;t they get?

Right on the heels of enacting the federal Dream Act through administrative fiat, the administration of President Obama, specifically Labor Secretary Hilda Solis, on Monday signed &quot;partnership&quot; agreements with ambassadors from a group of Latin American nations aiming to protect what she described as the labor rights of both legal and illegal migrants working in the U.S.

This ceremony marked the signing of partnership agreements with the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and El Salvador, joining Mexico, Nicaragua and Guatemala, which had signed the agreement previously.

            <title>Watching A Green Fiction Unravel   8.30.11</title>
            <description>Science: Experiments performed by a European nuclear research group indicate that the sun, not man, determines Earth&apos;s temperature. Somewhere, Al Gore just shuddered as an unseasonably cool breeze blows by.

The results from an experiment to mimic Earth&apos;s atmosphere by CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, tell researchers that the sun has a significant effect on our planet&apos;s temperature. Its magnetic field acts as a gateway for cosmic rays, which play a large role in cloud formation.

Consequently, when the sun&apos;s magnetic field allows cosmic rays to seed cloud cover, temperatures are cooler. When it restricts cloud formation by deflecting cosmic rays away from Earth, temperatures go up.

            <description>Leadership: So the U.S. just spent $1 billion to liberate Libya from terrorist rule only to have Libya&apos;s new rulers thumb their noses at extraditing the Lockerbie bomber? Explain to us again what we&apos;ve been doing in Libya.

Presumably, President Obama&apos;s slapped-together NATO mission to aid Libya&apos;s rebels was to rid that country of its mad-dog dictator, who was a one-man nexus for global terrorism.

From Africa to the Philippines to Colombia, Moammar Gadhafi was the go-to man for global terror, handing out cash, training and safe haven since the 1970s.

Appearing on Fox News on Monday, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., gave one of the most succinct descriptions of the Obama administration&apos;s economic policy yet heard.

The White House, he said, has &quot;demonstrated that it is not interested in focusing on private-sector growth.&quot;

            <description>Retirement: When Gov. Rick Perry called Social Security a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot; and a &quot;monstrous lie,&quot; the usual suspects complained about his irresponsible rhetoric. But why should Perry soft pedal a hard truth?

When asked about Social Security at a presidential campaign stop in Iowa this weekend, Perry said: &quot;It is a Ponzi scheme for these young people. The idea that they&apos;re working and paying into Social Security today, that the current program is going to be there for them, is a lie. It is a monstrous lie on this generation.&quot;

You could almost hear the left&apos;s collective jaws dropping. How could anyone say this about their most-beloved New Deal program, which has rescued millions of seniors from poverty and let millions more live dignified middle-class lives?

About that same time, Sen. Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, whined about taxpayers subsidizing &quot;the five biggest, most profitable corporations in the history of the planet.&quot;

            <description>Overcriminalization: Guitar. n. a stringed musical instrument with a long, fretted neck, a flat, somewhat violinlike body, and typically six strings plucked with the fingers. Also a target of the federal government.

It&apos;s true that, since those long-ago, legendary days of Jimi Hendrix and his mates, the ancient instrument — kitarah in Arabic, kithara in Greek — has been distorted beyond recognition. But are some zonked backwoodsmen now hooking them and poking them into trout streams? Are they amping them up so the sound waves knock endangered eagles out of the sky?

Neither, it turns out. Now the Internet is reverberating with a mean blues riff about how the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over the last two years has twice raided Gibson factories in Tennessee.

            <title>Perry Vs. Gore   8.29.11</title>
            <description>Junk Science: The governor of a state under assault by the EPA takes on the patron saint of climate change over whether &quot;warmers&quot; or &quot;deniers&quot; benefit financially from the debate. Meanwhile, the nation loses.

Is Texas governor and presidential candidate Rick Perry a racist? According to the increasingly bombastic Al &quot;expletive deleted&quot; Gore, who was interviewed by Climate Reality Project collaborator Alex Bogusky on Ustream last Friday, Perry&apos;s global warming skepticism qualifies him as one.

Gore related how his &quot;generation watched Bull Connor turning the hose on civil rights demonstrators&quot; and that it was when racists could not answer the question of why blacks were inferior &quot;with integrity&quot; that &quot;the change really started.&quot;

            <title>Krueger&apos;s Keynesian Leftovers   8.29.11</title>
            <description>Economics: Just a week before he unveils a new, improved jobs plan, President Obama has named a new person to be his top economic adviser, Princeton University&apos;s Alan Krueger. This doesn&apos;t bode well for job creation.

Krueger, a labor economist, is no obscure academic. Though youngish at 50, he&apos;s been around for decades, most recently spending two years in Obama&apos;s Treasury Department. And in the 1990s, he served a stint as Bill Clinton&apos;s chief labor economist.

By naming him to the chairmanship of the president&apos;s Council of Economic Advisers, replacing the departed Austan Goolsbee, Obama is sending a strong signal to the business world, Wall Street and the rest of America: expect little in the way of major economic policy shifts.

            <title>The Fed Should Go On Vacation   8.26.11</title>
            <description>Economy: Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a much-anticipated speech at the central bank&apos;s annual Jackson Hole gathering, said he has no immediate plans to do anything dramatic. To which we say: good.

Three years of hyperactive policy intervention, during which the Fed has printed trillions of new dollars, clearly hasn&apos;t worked. Why pile one failure on top of another?

Even so, Bernanke told the Jackson Hole, Wyo., gathering he has still more tricks up his sleeve, and hinted he might unveil something next month. &quot;The Fed has a range of tools that could be used to provide additional monetary stimulus,&quot; he said.

More tools? If this were a gunfight, Bernanke would be out of bullets. Two rounds of quantitative easing since 2008 have pumped an estimated $2.3 trillion into the banking system. What do we have to show for it?

On Friday, the Commerce Department reported that the economy grew just 1% in the second quarter, below the 1.4% first estimated. For the entire first half, GDP was up just 0.7%, a pathetic performance this far along in a recovery (see accompanying editorial at right).

Fact is, the economy seems to be sliding, despite the massive Fed stimulus of zero percent interest rates and more than $2 trillion in newly printed money.

            <title>Chile&apos;s Un-Reagan   8.26.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: A big protest in Latin America normally doesn&apos;t merit the time of day. But when the target is free markets — and it happens in Chile, one of the few nations that has them — then there&apos;s a leadership problem.

President Sebastian Pinera, who impressed the world with his crisis management during 2010&apos;s mine rescue, is, infuriatingly enough, proving far less capable on a test of principles.

For two days, Latin America&apos;s freest and most advanced economy was engulfed in an illegal national strike. Its burning garbage, looting and 1,400 arrests were nothing but an attack on Chile&apos;s free markets.

It was led by left-wing activists, public employee unions and gullible students — whose leader is a communist the media glorifies as a new Che Guevara. Their aim was to break Chile&apos;s popularly approved 1980 constitution, nationalize education because it&apos;s &quot;free,&quot; create state pensions, nationalize industries and end reforms that made Chile so unlike its neighbors.

Pinera let them run all over him the way University of California at Berkeley President Clark Kerr, wanting to be liked, let foul-mouthed protestors lay the University of California low in the 1960s.

&quot;After more than three months in which we&apos;ve seen violence and conflict flourish, now is the time for peace, the time for unity, the time for dialogue, the time for agreements,&quot; Pinera said.

            <title>The Endless Economic Recovery  8.26.11</title>
            <description>Economy: If you needed another metric by which to measure the failure of Obamanomics, new numbers released Friday show that two years after the recession ended the economy still hasn&apos;t fully recovered.

According to the revised gross domestic product data released Friday, the nation&apos;s economy grew a paltry 1% in the second quarter, after eking out a barely noticeable 0.4% gain in the first.

As a result, two years after the recession ended, the economy still hasn&apos;t made up the ground it lost, giving Obama the dubious distinction of presiding over the most prolonged economic recovery since the Great Depression.

This isn&apos;t just slightly bad. It&apos;s monumentally bad.

An IBD review of all the post-World War II recessions shows that, on average, it took just over two fiscal quarters for the economy to recover from a downturn and start expanding again.

In contrast, we&apos;re eight quarters into the Obama recovery, and the expansion is somewhere off in the distance, with real GDP still $65.5 billion below the pre-recession peak. And if you take into account all the population growth that&apos;s occurred over the past two years, we&apos;re even further behind.

Obama likes to blame the depth of the downturn for the &quot;painfully slow&quot; recovery. &quot;We didn&apos;t get into this mess overnight, and we won&apos;t get out of it overnight. It&apos;s going to take time,&quot; he said — nearly a year ago.

            <title>Obama&apos;s Labor Pains   8.26.11</title>
            <description>Politics: Having seen its agenda falter, the AFL-CIO announces that in 2012 unions will scale back working in tandem with the Democratic Party and instead set up its own structures to support candidates.

In politics, hell hath no fury like a union scorned, and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is not amused by the performance, or the lack of it, by the Democratic leadership in Washington in general and President Obama in particular in crossing items off labor&apos;s wish list.

On Thursday, Trumka told reporters at a breakfast sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor that organized labor is preparing to go it alone in 2012, using its money and manpower to set up its own structures and support candidates of its choosing rather than funneling everything through Democratic Party coffers and accepting its dictates.

The union plans to create its own &quot;super-PAC,&quot; a political action committee that will put its stamp of approval on ideologically pure candidates, fund and support them, and hold them directly accountable for their votes.

The failure to pass card-check, which would have ended the secret ballot in union certification elections, as well as free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and lack of progress on other issues have not sat well with union leaders.

&quot;During the campaign,&quot; Trumka said in June in an interview with Bloomberg, &quot;he (Obama) made significant promises to do an inventory of the free-trade agreements&quot; to be certain they protected workers&apos; rights. &quot;He&apos;s obviously forgotten that promise.&quot;

In that interview, Trumka said the unions will be &quot;holding candidates on both sides accountable.&quot; Those candidates that unions consider &quot;acquaintances,&quot; those who cross the proverbial aisle or otherwise compromise with Republicans won&apos;t receive support. &quot;Those Democrats that are friends will get more&quot; aid than in the past, Trumka said.

            <description>Entrepreneurs: Most of the reactions to the resignation of Steve Jobs as CEO of Apple have been predictably mournful, even elegiac. We choose to celebrate his great career — and what it says about America.

When the history of the digital age is written, Jobs will hold a special place as perhaps its greatest creator and entrepreneur.

Apple&apos;s departing genius has created one iconic product after another — Apple I, Apple II, Macintosh, iMac, iPod, iPhone, iPad — the list goes on and is still growing. Many have become life-changing accessories for average Americans or productivity aids for businesses.

            <description>Technology: While Democrats agonize over the &quot;digital divide&quot; separating urban black youth from Web access, data show the gap closing. But hold the applause. It&apos;s led to high-tech thuggery.

A member of the Congressional Black Caucus this week blamed black unemployment on &quot;racism&quot; and the &quot;digital divide,&quot; defined as the gap between those with access to computers and the Internet and those without it.

&quot;It has a lot to do with many issues: racism, shipping jobs overseas, no access to technology,&quot; said Rep. Frederica Wilson, D- Fla. &quot;You know, the digital divide is there, and many of the new jobs — that&apos;s what it requires. So we have a problem.&quot;

            <title>USGS Ups The Ante On Shale   8.25.11</title>
            <description>Power: Despite efforts in the media and Congress to shut it down through fear and falsehoods, a new estimate of America&apos;s most promising energy source portends even more gas, oil — and jobs.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) announced Tuesday that the Marcellus Shale formation that straddles the northeastern United States may hold a staggering 84 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of recoverable natural gas, up significantly from the last official government estimate of 2 tcf made in 2002.

The USGS said the estimate came from new information about the gas-rich formation underlying New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, and from technical improvements in how wells are drilled and the gas is extracted.

            <title>Patent Reform A Jobs Plan? Not So Fast   8.25.11</title>
            <description>At just about every opportunity recently, President Obama has touted a short list of things Congress could do &quot;right now&quot; that would create jobs. And high on that list is patent reform.

By fixing the patent system, he said this month, inventors could get patents &quot;without a lot of red tape and bureaucracy and start businesses that could be hiring.&quot;

Sen. Patrick Leahy, co-sponsor of a reform bill, says it will create 200,000 jobs. Obama&apos;s patent office head, David Kappos, told lawmakers &quot;millions of jobs are lying in wait&quot; for &quot;a job creation engine (to be) turned loose.&quot;

            <description>Security: Key Democrats like Nancy Pelosi supported the Bush administration&apos;s aggressive terrorist surveillance, former Vice President Dick Cheney&apos;s new book reveals. They switched only after it was no longer secret.

The Drudge Report on Thursday posted excerpts from the ex-Veep&apos;s soon-to-be-published memoir, &quot;In My Time.&quot;

They include an account of a classified briefing Dick Cheney took part in along with Democratic congressional leaders Nancy Pelosi, who would become House speaker, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, then-House intelligence committee ranking Democrat Jane Harman, and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, former vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee.

            <title>Payroll Tax Cut Is Trap For GOP  8.24.11</title>
            <description>Economic Policy: The Democrats&apos; aggressive push to extend the payroll tax cut for another year has nothing to do with boosting economic growth and everything to do with class

warfare politics.

The Democratic National Committee (DNC) made it known this week that it plans a full-court press to extend the temporary payroll tax cut into 2012.

Enacted as part of the deal last December to extend the Bush income tax cuts, it trimmed workers&apos; Social Security tax rate to 4.2% from 6.2% this year.

President Obama routinely includes the extension as part of his jobs plan because, he says, &quot;it will mean more customers for businesses and more jobs across the country.&quot;

But Democrats have another goal in mind — to cast Republicans who might oppose the extension as the party of tax hikes on working stiffs.

As the DNC told the Huffington Post, &quot;this week&apos;s push is just the tip of the iceberg of an effort to highlight exactly who the party of &apos;corporations are people&apos; is really fighting for.&quot;

            <description>Energy: A year ago, three oil rigs fled the Gulf of Mexico for better opportunities abroad. Now, it&apos;s 10. Make no mistake, the toll is rising on a business environment marked by the Obama administration&apos;s uncertainty.

It&apos;s a sorry spectacle when rigs, the mighty instruments for extracting oil and gas from miles under the sea floor, are quietly pulling away from U.S. coasts for better business environments oceans away — namely the Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Egypt and Brazil.

&quot;When you have companies that would be spending hundreds of millions of dollars, or in some cases billions of dollars, they need certainty,&quot; Louisiana Oil &amp; Gas Association President Don Briggs told BigGovernment.com. &quot;We don&apos;t have that now, and I don&apos;t expect we will anytime soon.&quot;

The massive planning, capital, project management and luck required to produce energy are uncertain enough.

The climate of government caprice makes it even worse.

            <title>Ivy-Beleaguered No Longer?   8.24.11</title>
            <description>Elitism: The candidacy of Rick Perry and the rise of the Tea Party have produced a strange side effect: Some Ivy League-educated elites are worried about losing privileges.

At the American Medical Association&apos;s annual conference in Chicago two years ago, President Obama got booed when he told the crowd, &quot;I&apos;m not advocating caps on malpractice awards.&quot;

Of all the things to go out on a limb over, why that?  The answer has more to do with lawyers than doctors. The Association of Trial Lawyers of America — trial attorneys being the main beneficiaries of malpractice awards — has bestowed tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions over the decades, about 90% to Democrats.

Obama sent a message to those ambulance chasers: I&apos;m your man.  But for them, it seems, there is also a man to destroy: Rick Perry.

Politico reports that &quot;if Perry ends up as the Republican nominee for president, deep-pocketed trial lawyers intend to play a central role in the campaign to defeat him.&quot;  Reporter Alexander Burns writes that &quot;among litigators, there is no presidential candidate who inspires the same level of hatred — and fear — as Perry, an avowed opponent of the plaintiffs&apos; bar who has presided over several rounds of tort reform as governor.&quot;

            <title>Hike Taxes, Hemorrhage Jobs   8.24.11</title>
            <description>States: As another manufacturer leaves, Illinois leads the nation in job loss in July. The free fall began with a tax hike. When will liberals learn when you tax something, you get less of it?

The states were envisioned by the Founding Fathers as islands of sovereignty, laboratories of democracy, each free to discover what works and what doesn&apos;t. In Illinois, the experiment of taxing your way back to prosperity has failed miserably.

The passage of a 67% income tax hike in January 2011, as well as higher corporate taxes, has coincided with a downturn in state employment. Since the enactment of this massive tax increase, Illinois has lost 89,000 jobs.

This move by Illinois Democrats in the state legislature and Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn has helped drive businesses such as Blue Island, Ill..-based Modern Drop Forge Co., an automotive parts company with 240 employees, out of the state, in this case into the welcoming arms of Republican Gov. Mitch Daniel&apos;s Indiana.

Echoing the concerns of companies including Peoria-based Caterpillar, the CEO of Modern Drop Forge told CBS2 Chicago that &quot;Illinois is becoming very, very unfriendly to manufacturers. We now have the highest state income tax in the United States, and the overall income taxes for corporations in Illinois are among the highest in the free world.&quot;

            <description>Subprime Scandal: The White House wants to keep Fannie and Freddie around to subsidize &quot;affordable housing.&quot; But why? Affordability has rarely been better for first-time homebuyers.

Recent data undercut the White House&apos;s claim that the failed, government-sponsored mortgage giants still play a &quot;vital&quot; role in ensuring that lower-income Americans &quot;have access to an adequate range of affordable housing options.&quot;

The market is taking care of that.

This year, the Housing Affordability Index soared to its third-highest level ever, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Its index measures household purchasing power by looking at a combination of median home price, median family income and current mortgage interest rates.

Home prices and loan rates are expected to continue to fall, further boosting affordability. Yet the administration insists on preserving Fannie and Freddie and their dubious affordable-housing charter.

            <title>Editorial: It Really Was The Spending, Stupid   8.23.11</title>
            <description>Big Government: The Tea Party has so influenced the national discourse that the question is no longer, &quot;Is spending really the problem?&quot; Now it&apos;s: &quot;Which kind of government spending is worst?&quot;

Washington may just have felt a taste of what life on the Left Coast is like, with a 5.9 earthquake leading to the evacuation of the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday.

In fact, the earth alongside the Potomac has been shaking for some time — first with the Tea Party &quot;town hells&quot; liberal members of Congress experienced two years ago, then with the election of the Tea Party-backed Scott Brown to fill the late Ted Kennedy&apos;s Massachusetts Senate seat, and finally, big-spending President Obama&apos;s rock-bottom disapproval ratings.

            <description>Regulation: As the FCC puts the final stake through the heart of the &quot;fairness doctrine,&quot; it&apos;s important to remember who supported this blatantly anti-free-speech rule. Hint: It wasn&apos;t &quot;narrow-minded&quot; Republicans.

As part of President Obama&apos;s effort to skim off the worst regulations, the Federal Communications Commission said it was once and for all killing the 62-year-old Fairness Doctrine.

FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said the doctrine, whatever its intentions, &quot;holds the potential to chill free speech and the free flow of ideas.&quot;

He&apos;s certainly right about that. Indeed, few federal rules were as misbegotten as the Fairness Doctrine.

            <title>Biden Endorses &apos;One Child&apos; Policy   8.23.11</title>
            <description>Population: The vice president gives a thumbs up to Beijing&apos;s policy of sustainable growth through forced population control. This is no gaffe. The White House endorses this policy. Just ask the president&apos;s science adviser.

We are used to the &quot;mouth that roared&quot; putting his foot in it. But Vice President Joe Biden&apos;s remarks at Sichuan University in China clearly embrace the progressive belief that people are a plague on the Earth — not its greatest resource.

&quot;Your policy has been one which I fully understand — I&apos;m not second-guessing — of one child per family. The result being that you&apos;re in a position where one wage earner will be taking care of four retired people. Not sustainable,&quot; Biden opined, embracing entitlement reform, Beijing-style.

            <title>Sucker-ing California   8.23.11</title>
            <description>Junk Science: Environmental debate is often framed as a conflict of progress vs. conservation. But in California, a federal environmental agency&apos;s bid to halt local conservation efforts reveals the real objective: expanding power.

Twelve state and local water agencies in Southern California are suing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service over its arbitrary decision last July to double the size of the habitat for a small algae-eating fish known as the Santa Ana Sucker.

Wielding the all-purpose Endangered Species Act, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&apos;s no-explanation decision plants a Godzilla-sized footprint over local efforts to conserve the fish and its environment.

            <description>Politics: In his weekly radio address and elsewhere over the weekend, President Obama blamed Republicans for &quot;holding back&quot; the recovery by blocking his still-MIA jobs plan. This wins the prize for Oval Office hubris.

He&apos;s even questioning the &quot;patriotism&quot; of GOP leaders on the Hill, claiming they&apos;re putting politics above country. &quot;They&apos;re more interested in the politics of it than they are in solving the problem,&quot; he complained .

&quot;The worst part is when you are talking to a family member of a fallen soldier and you are hugging them,&quot; he added. &quot;And then you see sometimes our politics not living up to that level of commitment and patriotism that we see from our troops.&quot;

            <description>Media: Just days before the U.S.-Colombia free trade pact heads for a vote, the Washington Post publishes a story claiming Colombia&apos;s miracle is a sham. This is a smear unworthy of the name &quot;journalism.&quot;

Topping the front page in its Sunday edition with &quot;A case of aid gone bad in Colombia,&quot; the Post attempted to rewrite history by claiming the U.S.&apos;s $8 billion Plan Colombia military program that broke the back of its drug cartels was really ... a waste.

Pay no attention to the safety, security and economic growth that have made Colombia such an attractive partner for a free trade treaty expected to go to a vote in September. And definitely pay no attention to the 80%-plus popularity of President Alvaro Uribe among Colombians who see him as their Lincoln.

            <description>Arab Spring: As rebel forces pour into Libya&apos;s capital of Tripoli and consolidate their hold on power, Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi&apos;s time is up. Now the only real question is will he be replaced by something far worse?

It&apos;s easy to cheer on the Libyan rebels as they unseat one of the world&apos;s most odious and terroristic dictators, a mass murderer whose demise will surely make the world a better place.

But there&apos;s a lingering question: Who will take his place? It&apos;s not entirely clear the rebels&apos; umbrella governing group, the U.S.-recognized Transitional National Council, will be a moderate force in Libya.

            <title>EPA&apos;s Looming Blackouts   8.22.11</title>
            <description>Energy: It won&apos;t matter which light bulbs we use as the administration&apos;s implementation of cross-state pollution rules shuts down coal plants across the country. Where will the jobs be when the lights go out?

It&apos;s called the Cross-State Pollution Rule, announced last month, and its implementation over the next 18 months will likely result in the loss of a fifth of the nation&apos;s electricity-generating capacity.

The result will be likely power shortages, skyrocketing rates and inevitable brownouts and rolling blackouts.

Based on Bush-era EPA proposals that the federal courts threw out in 2008, this latest example of legislation is designed to usurp state powers to regulate their in-state emissions by making it a federal issue on the grounds pollution crosses state lines.

Based on Bush-era EPA proposals that the federal courts threw out in 2008, this latest example of legislation is designed to usurp state powers to regulate their in-state emissions by making it a federal issue on the grounds pollution crosses state lines.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Desperation On Rise   8.22.11</title>
            <description>Economy: In another sign of how lousy the president&apos;s so-called recovery&apos;s been, millions of desperately unemployed are now threatening to sink Social Security&apos;s disability lifeboat.

This year, 3.3 million people are expected to apply to Social Security for disability benefits. That&apos;s 700,000 more than in 2008, and a million more than a decade ago. As a result, the Congressional Budget Office expects the program to run out of money in six short years.

Social Security&apos;s disability program is meant for those who, because of a serious handicap, are unable to find gainful employment. But Social Security commissioner Michael Astrue is blunt about the cause of the recent application explosion, telling the Associated Press that &quot;it&apos;s primarily economic desperation.&quot;

            <title>Obama&apos;s Amnesty-Light Is A Bad Dream   8.19.11</title>
            <description>Immigration: Unable to get &quot;comprehensive immigration reform&quot; past Congress, the White House announces it will halt deportations on a case-by-case basis for some illegal aliens. Don&apos;t enforce the law and they will come.

Following a pattern of making law by regulation and executive order, the Obama administration Thursday announced it will impose a version of the Dream (development, relief and education for alien minors) Act on America through administrative fiat.

This is blatant political pandering in an election cycle at the expense of American citizens.

On Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told Congress she has authority to halt deportation of illegal aliens not perceived to be a criminal threat as long as they meet certain criteria, such as attending school or having family in the military.

The new rules would cover up to 300,000 illegal aliens. In 2010, the government deported 200,000 with no criminal records. Under the new rules, most would now likely be allowed to stay and apply for permits.

            <title>Green Jobs, Red Faces   8.19.11</title>
            <description>Industrial Policy: The fact that President Obama&apos;s &quot;green jobs&quot; campaign has been an enormously expensive failure is now so glaringly obvious even the New York Times can&apos;t ignore it any longer.

In a surprisingly candid article headlined &quot;Number of Green Jobs Fails to Live Up to Promises,&quot; the Times&apos; Aaron Glantz reports that &quot;federal and state efforts to stimulate creation of green jobs have largely failed, government records show,&quot; and that Obama&apos;s goal of 5 million new green jobs in 10 years is a &quot;pipe dream.&quot;

Glantz notes, for example, that Obama&apos;s much-heralded weatherization program &quot;never caught on.&quot;

California still has spent only about half its $186 million in federal weatherization funds, creating a grand total of 538 full-time jobs. He also points to the $59 million spent in California on green job training that resulted in just 719 placements.

Glantz isn&apos;t the first mainstream reporter to discover this. Earlier in the year, Politico reported that &quot;nearly three years into Obama&apos;s presidency, the White House can&apos;t point to much solid evidence that significant numbers of Americans are scoring the green jobs the president has been touting.&quot;

            <title>Get Out Of The Way Of The Jobs   8.19.11</title>
            <description>Government: What should President Obama do to get America working again when he returns from his Martha&apos;s Vineyard vacation? The real question is: What should he stop doing?

The president goes through the motions of taking a bus tour (on a foreign-built coach) to commiserate with America&apos;s legions of unemployed. Then he vows yet another &quot;jobs plan,&quot; but only after he gets back from Fat Cat Isle.

What of that jobs program? The White House next month will simply repackage what they&apos;ve already done, like telling businesses that if you hire X number of employees, you&apos;ll pay less in taxes.

Instead of just cutting tax rates, government planner types insist on this kind of micromanaged, jump-through-the-hoops-and-we&apos;ll-reward-you approach. They just don&apos;t believe big, bad business wants to give people jobs.

            <description>National Security: With his boss on vacation, Vice President Joe Biden has a very important job to do. He&apos;s in China, begging communist officials to please keep buying our bonds. If they do, what&apos;s he giving them in return?

Sending Biden to China, pardon the phrase, raises red flags about what we might commit to while he&apos;s there. What is Biden, the gaffemeister in chief, authorized to give the Chinese?

Officially, the White House says Biden&apos;s in China to sell its leaders on the U.S. debt-ceiling deal that will trim $2.5 trillion from the expected deficits of $10 trillion over the next decade.

It took the lawyers of Judicial Watch almost two years to pry open White House records on the matter of who visited the president and his advisers in the first seven months of Obama&apos;s administration.

That information was solemnly promised to voters by candidate Obama in his 2008 campaign as a means of distinguishing his governing style from the supposedly ominous, secretive Halliburton-scarred presidency of his predecessor, George W. Bush.

Since Perry threw his hat into the presidential ring, reporters have been working overtime to debunk the Texas Miracle. But they can&apos;t seem to agree on what the problem is.

As the result, they&apos;ve been throwing anything and everything at the wall — no matter how tenuous — hoping something will stick.

            <title>In Defense Of Ratings Agencies   8.18.11</title>
            <description>Wall Street: Miffed that Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s downgraded U.S. credit on President Obama&apos;s watch, the left is doing its best to downgrade the rating agency&apos;s own credibility. But S&amp;P&apos;s getting a bad rap.

Attorney General Eric Holder is investigating whether S&amp;P improperly rated dozens of mortgage securities in the years before the financial crisis. The timing appears suspicious, though the New York Times says the probe began before S&amp;P ratcheted down long-term Treasury debt to AA plus earlier this month. No doubt the high-profile prosecution will give other credit agencies pause before initiating their own downgrades.

Meanwhile, Hill Democrats plan to hold hearings on &quot;reforming&quot; the entire ratings industry. Ideas on the table include nationalizing agencies, a profoundly bad idea. Public entities rating public debt would invite political corruption and scare off foreign investors.

            <title>Sun Sets On The President&apos;s Policies   8.18.11</title>
            <description>Power: As a White House-favored green-energy company files for bankruptcy, the Export-Import Bank announces $500 million in loans for solar energy projects — in India. America is being thrown under the president&apos;s bus.

It&apos;s bad enough we lavish and often waste huge subsidies on green companies like the now-bankrupt Evergreen Solar, based in Marlborough, Mass., trying to promote an energy source that would not be able to compete in the marketplace without them.

We&apos;re even promoting such failures abroad. The U.S. Export-Import Bank, an independent agency of the federal government, has announced $500 million in loans for new solar energy projects in India. This is on top of about $75 million already approved for similar projects in fiscal 2011.

            <title>Perry Vs. Petty: A Fight That Republicans Can Do Without   8.18.11</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: GOP consultant Karl Rove&apos;s provincial squabbles with Texas Gov. Rick Perry have no place in the national discourse. The Republican establishment had best set its eyes on the prize: defeating Obama.

Perry&apos;s entry into the presidential sweepstakes certainly has livened things up, at a time when President Obama&apos;s popularity plunges and a shaky economy gets even shakier. One unpleasant surprise, however, is the reaction of some of Perry&apos;s fellow Republicans.

Consider what&apos;s been happening in the race for the GOP nod.

            <title>That &apos;70s Show — Stagflation Returns   8.17.11</title>
            <description>Economy: Stubbornly high unemployment isn&apos;t the only thing ailing this recovery. Inflation keeps rising even as growth stagnates, raising the specter of 1970s-style &quot;stagflation.&quot;

The word had been banished from the economic lexicon for decades. But as the Fed commits to easy credit through mid-2013, new data suggest it may be making a comeback.

Consider the July producer price report released Wednesday. It shows core inflation building in the pipeline. Excluding food and energy, wholesale inflation rose 0.4% — the eighth straight increase.

A new Rasmussen poll says eight in 10 Americans are concerned about inflation, with a solid majority doubting the Fed&apos;s ability to control it; 93% of adults report paying more for groceries now than they did a year ago — the highest finding to date.

Now consider the government&apos;s shockingly weak report for second-quarter gross domestic product, which included benchmark revisions for growth and inflation going back three years.

Downward revisions to real growth in part reflect upward revisions in prices. As output rolled over again last quarter, the overall price index for gross domestic purchases shot up to a nearly three-year high of 2.6%. Core retail inflation also accelerated.

            <title>More, More, More   8.17.11</title>
            <description>California: Taking a break from leading his city down the path of economic decline, the mayor of Los Angeles lectures the state on how to squeeze more tax revenue out of business.

Given his track record, Antonio Villaraigosa hardly seems the one to give advice on how to get California moving again. His city, where he&apos;s been chief executive for six years, has been a drag on the state. Its jobless rate (13.9% in 2010) puts it at No. 44 worst among the nation&apos;s 50 largest cities.

But to this mayor, leading a once-booming city deeper into decline must be some sort of credential. So there he was at the state capital on Tuesday, delivering a heavily promoted speech to the Sacramento Press Club on schools, the state budget and, most pointedly, taxes.

He made no bones about it: California&apos;s problem is that its businesses are undertaxed, and that real liberals need to go after corporate wealth more aggressively.

&quot;Progressives have to start thinking — and acting — big again,&quot; he said. He proceeded to attack a favorite progressive target, the California property tax system created in 1978 by the voters through Proposition 13.

As many have before him, he called for a split-roll system in which only homeowners would continue to enjoy full Prop. 13 protection. As he put it, &quot;Prop. 13 was never intended to be a corporate tax giveaway, but that is what it has become.&quot;

            <title>Union Thugs? No Kidding   8.17.11</title>
            <description>Unions: An Ohio contractor was wounded by gunfire Wednesday by a shadowy man vandalizing his SUV with union threats. Where&apos;s Washington&apos;s outrage at such lawlessness?

Had King Electrical Services owner John King been shot by, say, a Tea Partyer, there&apos;d be no end to the public pontificating from Washington&apos;s politicians and media commentators about their rhetoric or protests inciting violence.

It&apos;s quite a different story for the Lambertville, Mich., contractor who woke up in the dead of night a week ago found a silhouetted figure on his driveway spraying &quot;SCAB&quot; on the side of his vehicle. The figure fired a gun at him before fleeing.

King runs a small business employing 40 people at high wages with good benefits. His success at a time when unionized contractors are failing made him the target of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which has unsuccessfully sought to unionize his workers.

            <title>The Dimlight Zone   8.17.11</title>
            <description>Economy: With the Obama stimulus fully exposed as a failure of galactic proportions, columnist Paul Krugman has unveiled his Plan B: space aliens. Too bad White House policy also remains on another planet.

From now on, every time New York Times columnist Paul Krugman appears on television, his walk-up music should be the eerie jingle-jangle of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; theme.

&quot;If we discovered that space aliens were planning to attack,&quot; Krugman told CNN&apos;s Fareed Zakaria on Sunday, &quot;and we needed a massive buildup to counter the space alien threat, and inflation and budget deficits took secondary place to that, this slump would be over in 18 months.&quot;

Where did Krugman get his idea for &quot;Up-in-the-Sky-Side Economics&quot;? He told Zakaria, &quot;There was a &apos;Twilight Zone&apos; episode like this in which scientists fake an alien threat in order to achieve world peace. Well, this time we don&apos;t need it; we need it in order to get some fiscal stimulus.&quot;

It isn&apos;t, of course, the only man-from-Mars thinking he espouses. America could &quot;use some inflation,&quot; according to Krugman. &quot;It&apos;s very hard to get inflation in a depressed economy, but if you had a program of government spending plus an expansionary policy by the Fed, you could get that. So if you think about using all these things together, you could accomplish a great deal.&quot;

            <title>Is U.S. Copying EU&apos;s Failed Model?   8.17.11</title>
            <description>Big Government: The lie at the heart of the European Union has been exposed this week as its leaders, worried about a monetary collapse, have pushed a new plan to make its government even bigger and more centralized.

This is what caused the EU&apos;s problems in the first place — a runaway welfare state that spends far too much and has become an unbearable drag on Europe&apos;s fast-graying, slow-growing economies.

Yet, there they were: French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, putative saviors of the European Union, linked arm in arm and vowing to create an even more centralized European superstate. The British newspaper the Daily Mail called it a &quot;coup.&quot; That description is no exaggeration.

In one swoop, Germany and France seem determined to control the rest of the continent — rather like a rich man putting his spendthrift children&apos;s money under conservatorship.

Only in this case, we&apos;re not talking about children. We&apos;re talking about sovereign nations that would give up their rights to self-governance in favor of the smothering embrace of German and French bureaucrats who, if the two leaders get their way, will now dictate economic affairs for the rest of Europe.

After a Paris summit called to deal with Europe&apos;s debt crisis — which is, believe it or not, worse than ours — Sarkozy and Merkel announced they agreed to create a &quot;true European economic government.&quot;

            <title>Fast And Furious Promotions?  8.17.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: As guns funneled by the ATF into Mexico continue to show up at crime scenes, three key supervisors of an operation that resulted in the deaths of two U.S. agents get moved up instead of fired.

Considering the unmitigated disaster that came from a program allegedly designed to track and capture gun traffickers, we would have expected a wave of resignations and dismissals, starting with Attorney General Eric Holder. Instead, we get kudos and career advancement.

William McMahon, who was the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&apos; deputy director of operations in the West, where the program was focused, as well as William Newell and David Voth, field supervisors in the ATF&apos;s Phoenix office, have all received new management positions at ATF headquarters in Washington, D.C.

A cynic would suggest that this was so the agency could keep tabs on the trio in the wake of investigations by Rep. Darrell Issa&apos;s House Government Operations and Oversight Committee and other boards. Both ATF and the Justice Department have been pressuring witnesses as well as withholding documents.

            <itunes:summary>Scandal: As guns funneled by the ATF into Mexico continue to show up at crime scenes, three key supervisors of an operation that resulted in the deaths of two U.S. agents get moved up instead of fired.

Considering the unmitigated disaster that came from a program allegedly designed to track and capture gun traffickers, we would have expected a wave of resignations and dismissals, starting with Attorney General Eric Holder. Instead, we get kudos and career advancement.

William McMahon, who was the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives&apos; deputy director of operations in the West, where the program was focused, as well as William Newell and David Voth, field supervisors in the ATF&apos;s Phoenix office, have all received new management positions at ATF headquarters in Washington, D.C.

A cynic would suggest that this was so the agency could keep tabs on the trio in the wake of investigations by Rep. Darrell Issa&apos;s House Government Operations and Oversight Committee and other boards. Both ATF and the Justice Department have been pressuring witnesses as well as withholding documents.</itunes:summary>

            <description>Blame Game: In his inaugural address 2 1/2 years ago, President Obama called for a &quot;new era of responsibility.&quot; Yet lately, his main goal in life seems to be escaping any responsibility for the lousy economy.

It&apos;s getting so you have to keep a list of everyone and everything Obama wants to blame for the anemic economic recovery.

So far, it includes:

            <title>A Curious Land Deal   8.16.11</title>
            <description>Scandal: The Cook County Assessor&apos;s office appears to have no record of any tax being paid on a property transfer between a future convicted felon and a future president in possible violation of Illinois law.

To hear President Obama tell it, Tony Rezko was just a &quot;guy in the neighborhood&quot; that he knew but like so many of Obama&apos;s past associations, they run long and deep and indicate a disturbing lack of judgment. Now a land deal between the two is again coming under suspicion.

In 2005, at a time Rezko was under federal investigation of influence peddling in former Illinois Gov. Blagojevich&apos;s administration, then-Sen. Obama and Rezko&apos;s wife Rita bought adjacent pieces of property from a Chicago doctor. Rezko would later be convicted of 16 of 24 counts of influence peddling.

            <description>Failed Policy: The Obama administration&apos;s jobs plan was based on a greening of the economy. But the green jobs aren&apos;t materializing, a fact driven home by the recent bankruptcy of a solar power company.

During the 2008 campaign, candidate Barack Obama said he would create 5 million well-paying &quot;green&quot; jobs within 10 years.

Politico has reported that &quot;he&apos;s spent considerable time since entering the White House trying to make that happen.&quot;

            <description>Subprime scandal: Despite publicly hinting at privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the White House secretly intends for the toxic twins to keep playing a major role in the mortgage industry.

Knock us over with a feather. Like Hill Democrats, who studiously avoided touching Fannie and Freddie in their 2,300-page financial-reform bill, President Obama wants to keep them around to subsidize &quot;affordable housing&quot; off-budget.

According to the Washington Post, quoting anonymous White House advisers, the administration favors &quot;restructuring Fannie and Freddie as public utilities overseen by a government regulator.&quot;

            <title>Editorial: Buffett Undertaxed? Just Write A Check   8.15.11</title>
            <description>Fiscal Policy: Warren Buffett may have hoped his call for a tax increase on the rich would make him look selfless. Instead, it just made him look like an uninformed hypocrite.

In a New York Times op-ed on Monday, Buffett complained that he and his super-rich friends &quot;have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress&quot; and should have their taxes raised immediately in the name of &quot;shared sacrifice.&quot;

In making his case, Buffett noted that the richest 400 taxpayers saw their average tax rate drop from 29.2% to 21.5% since 1992, and that he paid only 17.4% of his income in federal taxes last year.

            <title>Hijacking The Deficit Cutters   8.15.11</title>
            <description>Debt Crisis: The Congressional Black Caucus is trying to hijack the agenda of the super-committee appointed to tackle the deficit. The move confirms our fear that the panel will become an overly politicized joke.

A senior black caucus member, Democrat Rep. Jim Clyburn, announced he&apos;s going to use his position on the 12-member supercommittee to close the growing &quot;wealth gap&quot; between blacks and whites. By that, he means working with the five other Democrats on the panel to raise taxes on the rich and redistribute money to poor minorities.

&quot;The gap continues to grow wider between those who enjoy great wealth and those who struggle to get by with little thought of ever getting ahead,&quot; Clyburn said.

If you can&apos;t beat &apos;em, pretend they&apos;re going away. That seems to be the thinking behind Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid&apos;s odd prophecy that the Tea Party — which is seismically reshaping the Republican presidential field — will soon fade.

&quot;The Tea Party was the result of a terrible economy,&quot; Reid said Friday at an interview with Las Vegas Review-Journal writers. &quot;I&apos;ve said that many times, and I believe that.&quot;

Leo Gerard, the proudly Canadian president of the United Steelworkers Union, is one of many who ought to stand up and take a bow.

He and his fellow Big Labor union bosses loudly opposed the U.S.-Colombia free trade agreement, using their political muscle to keep the already-negotiated deal on ice in Congress and the White House for nearly five years.

            <description>Regulation: A Texas bank is preparing to shut down. No, it&apos;s not a failed institution being closed by federal agents. It serves its market. It makes a profit. So what&apos;s the trouble? It&apos;s sick of the heavy hand of government.

Main Street Bank of Kingwood, Texas, is a modest business. It has four branches and employs 60. It earned $11 million in the last year. The 27-year-old bank seems healthy.

The business climate it operates in, however, is not.

&quot;The regulatory environment makes it very difficult to do what we do,&quot; Main Street Chairman Thomas Depping has told the media.

            <itunes:subtitle>Regulation: A Texas bank is preparing to shut down.</itunes:subtitle>
            <itunes:summary>Regulation: A Texas bank is preparing to shut down. No, it&apos;s not a failed institution being closed by federal agents. It serves its market. It makes a profit. So what&apos;s the trouble? It&apos;s sick of the heavy hand of government.

Main Street Bank of Kingwood, Texas, is a modest business. It has four branches and employs 60. It earned $11 million in the last year. The 27-year-old bank seems healthy.

The business climate it operates in, however, is not.

&quot;The regulatory environment makes it very difficult to do what we do,&quot; Main Street Chairman Thomas Depping has told the media.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Obama&apos;s Shameful Photo-Op   8.15.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: Disrespecting grieving families, the president sneaks a photographer into the ceremony honoring the SEALs who died in Afghanistan. The presidential scrapbook and campaign are more important.

We thought perhaps the White House had received a sufficient dose of condemnation as well as some sensitivity training over a planned Sony film hyping President Obama&apos;s &quot;gutsy call&quot; regarding the successful Navy SEAL mission that killed Osama bin Laden. The film was to be released three weeks before the 2012 vote. We were wrong.

When 30 U.S. Special Operations forces, including Navy SEALs from SEAL Team 6, the unit that got the world&apos;s most-wanted man, were subsequently shot down in a helicopter, the nation mourned its heroes. The White House, it seems, loaded its cameras.

            <title>Editorial: ObamaCare Faces Death Panel Of Its Own   8.12.11</title>
            <description>Judgment Day: ObamaCare isn&apos;t dead yet, but it is sitting before a death panel of its own. A federal appeals court ruled Friday that a key provision that forces Americans to buy health care insurance is unconstitutional.

The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta decided, by a 2-1 margin, that the individual mandate is in violation of our foundational law. It is the first appeals court to rule against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

While the defenders of freedom should be pleased with the ruling, they cannot yet celebrate.

The decision will be appealed, ensuring that the case will eventually be in front of the Supreme Court. If that court fails to recognize, as the 11th Circuit did, that ObamaCare breaches our constitutional liberty, then we&apos;re in for a future of deep trouble.

            <title>In Texas, Perry Outshines Obama   8.12.11</title>
            <description>Compared with Barack Obama, the man with whom he could be locked in a battle for the presidency a year from now, Rick Perry is a study in contrasts.

Texas&apos; governor, who was set to enter the race for the Republican nomination on Saturday, is 11 years older than the president, was educated far from the Ivy League, has more executive experience — running the second-largest state for more than a decade — and is as far to the right on the political spectrum as Obama is to the left.

But just as noteworthy is the contrast between the two leaders&apos; economic records.

            <title>The Game-Changer From Texas   8.12.11</title>
            <description>Election &apos;12: Bypassing Iowa may have consequences for his candidacy, but Rick Perry&apos;s entry into the race will change everything. Will the public and his party be willing to put another Texas governor in the White House?

In what the chattering class perceives as a deliberate snub, Perry decided to forgo the chance to stand between Jon Huntsman and Ron Paul in Iowa, preferring to announce his candidacy for the White House in South Carolina. Why, they ask, would he try to steal the thunder from the Ames straw poll?

Perhaps because he feels he doesn&apos;t need it. The RealClearPolitics.com average of polls showed Perry in second place with 15.4%, trailing the presumed front-runner, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, by five points. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who hasn&apos;t announced a candidacy, places third, in a near-tie with Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, an announced candidate who polls fourth.

When you&apos;re looking for a Democratic member of Congress who will &quot;understand how critical it is for us all to work together, Republicans, Democrats, independents, in order to move this country forward,&quot; as President Obama told supporters in Michigan last week, do you turn to the guy who was chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for the 2008 elections?

That was what House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi did in naming House Budget Committee top Democrat Chris Van Hollen as one of the so-called 12 Imposters.

            <description>Racism: Across the U.S., mobs of black youths are organizing on Facebook to loot stores and beat whites. Yet none dare call the &quot;flash mob&quot; attacks hate crime, least of all the attorney general.

The Associated Press is reporting that at least one of those arrested in the Wisconsin State Fair beatings said the mob was targeting whites, making it a hate crime. Where is Eric Holder&apos;s civil rights division? About this epidemic of black-on-white assaults, we hear nothing.

At the Milwaukee fairgrounds, dozens of black teens suddenly appeared, knocking over children, looting the Midway games and stealing prizes. They pulled whites from cars, flung them to the ground and punched and kicked them in the face. At least 18 people were injured, including some cops.

            <description>Politics: Unions&apos; failure to recall four Republican state senators shows that their days of power through intimidation are over. If this was a rehearsal for 2012, the White House should start making other plans.

The natives are still restless, the pitchforks sharp and the Walker revolution safe. Portrayed by union leaders as an aberration fueled by a generic voter wrath against incumbents, the GOP grab of both houses of Wisconsin&apos;s legislature and the governor&apos;s office in 2010 was predicted to fade once voters realized &quot;workers&apos; rights&quot; were at risk.

Then a funny thing happened on the way to the polling booth, that shrine to the secret ballot so anathema to union leaders. Voters decided they liked a limited government that said there are things we just can&apos;t afford. They also liked the idea that taxpayers had rights and could and should control how their money is spent.

On the issue, Alan Greenspan was the skunk at the &quot;Meet the Press&quot; roundtable last Sunday. &quot;The economy is slowing down — you can see it in all the data,&quot; the former Fed chief said.

As a result, he added, &quot;this deficit problem that sits out there is much larger than we&apos;ve been calculating, because the actual numbers employed by those people who are calculating the deficits are based on a level of economic activity which we are not achieving.&quot;

On Tuesday, MSNBC&apos;s liberal talk-show host Chris Matthews was pitching his idea about how President Obama could sell his new stimulus plan, arguing that the White House should offer specific examples of jobs created in congressional districts and &quot;force&quot; Republicans &quot;to say yes or no to creating jobs in their own districts.&quot;

Howard Fineman, who serves as the Huffington Post&apos;s senior political editor, liked the idea so much he personally pitched it to the White House. &quot;As a matter of fact,&quot; he told Matthews, &quot;I summarized your proposal and reminded the people at the White House of it, and asked them to take a look.&quot;

            <title>Following A Saudi Lead On Syria    8.10.11</title>
            <description>Mideast: In his first-ever condemnation of another Arab state, Saudi King Abdullah has taken Syria to task for the atrocities it has committed on its own citizens. And where was the U.S.? Leading from behind, of course.

The Saudi king startled the world over the weekend by blasting dictator Bashar al-Assad and recalling his ambassador after Syria&apos;s massacre of democracy protestors during the holy month of Ramadan.

            <title>Editorial: Fed&apos;s Rate Timing Is Politically Curious    8.9.11</title>
            <description>Economy: Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke says the central bank will keep interest rates low at least until mid-2013. We agree interest rates should not be raised while the economy is struggling, but the timing is rather curious.

Of course, 2013 takes us past the election of November 2012. Is the Fed now trying to keep quiet so as not to endanger the re-election chances of President Obama? Or is it something else?

We hate to sound so cynical, but this era of heavily politicized decision-making at the federal level seems to breed doubt about the motives of our policymakers.

            <title>SEAL Team 6 — The Movie?    8.9.11</title>
            <description>Politics: The president&apos;s Hollywood friends are planning an exploitation flick to hype his role in the bin Laden raid to debut three weeks before the 2012 election. What does the Federal Election Commission think of this?

We all remember the famous war room photo of the assembled White House multitude, including President Obama, breathlessly watching the raid that killed Osama bin Laden unfold in real time. Some have suggested that the photo was staged or altered, if only because it shows Vice President Joe Biden&apos;s eyes open and mouth shut.

The phrase &quot;on his watch&quot; has been overused by presidents and their critics to claim credit and assign blame for events the Oval Office occupant may have had little to do with or little control over or that were set into motion long before. The bin Laden raid is no exception.

            <title>To Rule Means To Reign    8.9.11</title>
            <description>Regulation Nation: The administration proposed 229 new rules in July and finalized another 379. Sen. John Barrasso says that 31 days of regulatory excess will cost the economy $9.5 billion. The madness must stop.

Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, issued his regulations memo last week. If he&apos;s on the mark, federal red tape will add as much as $114 billion in new costs to the economy a year — no small hit.

With this in mind, Republicans are planning to make a hard run at regulatory reform next month when they will reportedly press the Reins Act.

            <description>Homeland Security: The White House seems to think the best way to get Muslims to help root out terrorists in their communities is with more &quot;social services.&quot;

That&apos;s the long and short of the administration&apos;s new strategy to counter &quot;radicalization&quot; outlined in an eight-page paper recently released by the White House.

Signed by President Obama, the document presumes that Muslims living in America are mostly downtrodden and may be driven to terror out of a &quot;sense of disenfranchisement.&quot;

Therefore, the government must work harder to &quot;provide social services&quot; for them — including &quot;jobs, education, health care and civil rights&quot; — to &quot;prevent radicalization that leads to violence.&quot;

            <title>Behind The Volatility    8.9.11</title>
            <description>The Market: The painful ups and downs of the stock indexes over the last two weeks have left equity investors searching for explanations. Maybe it&apos;s time for a review of what causes such big swings.

We all know that electronic markets move stock prices with lightning speed, power and sometimes little regard for fundamentals. The Flash Crash of May 6, 2010, made this painfully clear. In recent sessions, the Volatility Index (VIX) reached the levels of the Flash Crash, but fell short of levels in the 2008-09 bear market. Still, the dent in public investors&apos; psyches has been significant.

Investors also understand the recent gyrations have been tied to the debt-ceiling debate, the S&amp;P credit downgrade, the sputtering domestic economy and the European economic train wreck. But understanding how these troubling developments cause movement in equity prices is another matter. In our global investment landscape, it&apos;s a complicated process indeed.

            <description>Leadership: Reacting to the U.S. credit downgrade, President Obama gave a damaging statement proving he has learned nothing from his ideological mistakes. A true leader accepts blame — and reality.

The Dow fell Monday by over 634 points in the worst drop since the 2008 financial crisis, a clear reaction to President Obama&apos;s politically self-defensive statement on S&amp;P&apos;s unprecedented credit downgrade of the U.S.

The president uttered the same disingenuous banalities we&apos;ve heard for months. He insists &quot;it&apos;s not a lack of plans or policies that&apos;s the problem here. It&apos;s a lack of political will in Washington. It&apos;s the insistence on drawing lines in the sand, a refusal to put what&apos;s best for the country ahead of self-interest or party or ideology.&quot;

            <description>Financial Crisis: After downgrading U.S. government debt, S&amp;P also cut ratings on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Maybe now we can honestly discuss their roles in our meltdown.

&apos;The downgrades of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reflect their direct reliance on the U.S. government,&quot; Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s said Monday in an understatement.

Fannie and Freddie, in fact, were the triggers for the entire financial crisis — the tools politicians used to execute a policy based on lending money to people who couldn&apos;t afford to pay it back.

            <title>Presidential Failure    8.8.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: If the president meant to calm the markets on Monday, he failed utterly — and no wonder. All he did was make it clear he&apos;s completely out of ideas on how to get the economy moving again.

After his televised remarks, the Dow industrial average continued to fall, finishing 5.5% lower. The Nasdaq plummeted 6.9%.

Why should it have been any different? In his brief statement, the only thing President Obama demonstrated was a cluelessness about the country&apos;s current mess — of which the debt downgrade is just the latest example — and an even weaker grasp on how to fix it.

            <title>Did Biden Out SEAL Team 6?    8.8.11</title>
            <description>War On Terror: The deaths of more than 20 Navy SEALs from the unit that took out Osama bin Laden may be linked to a loose-lipped vice president and a presidential action figure.

The last scene of the 1954 Korean War film &quot;The Bridges at Toko-Ri,&quot; based on the James Michener novel, shows a carrier commander watching planes take off for another mission and asking, &quot;Where do we get such men?&quot;

The same may be asked of the members of Navy SEAL (sea, air, land) Team 6 who died when the helicopter they were riding was hit by a Taliban-launched rocket-propelled grenade in the Tangi Valley of Wardak province just west of Kabul, Afghanistan.

            <title>A Psychological Blow    8.8.11</title>
            <description>Markets: For the first time, America&apos;s good name has been downgraded. So far, the impact on bonds has been small. But the long-term consequences won&apos;t be pretty.

Back in 1992, Bill Clinton learned that U.S. credit equaled U.S. power. After wrangling with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, his team gained such respect for treasuries as a proxy for U.S. credibility that Clinton adviser James Carville famously declared he wanted be reincarnated as the bond market &quot;so I can intimidate everyone.&quot;

Today, we have a president who shrugs off the first-ever downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt in the wake of Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s downgrade from AAA to AA+, claiming that credit, like deficits, doesn&apos;t matter.

            <title>Editorial: Happy Birthday, But Not So Happy Us    8.5.11</title>
            <description>Leadership: As the economy flatlines and stocks crater, the Pied Piper of hope and change leads us over a cliff while blowing out birthday candles at the White House and snuffing out America&apos;s future.

This administration has been so wretched, its performance so incompetent, that we half-expect to see billboards popping up with the image of Jimmy Carter and the words, &quot;Miss me yet?&quot;

At least Carter, who with any luck will be supplanted in 2013 as America&apos;s worst former president, used appropriate symbolism in donning sweaters, sitting in front of fireplaces and complaining of America&apos;s &quot;malaise.&quot; His birthdays, we recall, were relatively quiet affairs.

            <title>A Free-Trade Finale At Last?    8.5.11</title>
            <description>Politics: Has America&apos;s bleak economy finally caught President Obama&apos;s attention? How else to explain the sudden movement on three free-trade pacts that have been gathering dust in a White House desk drawer for five years?

It certainly has caught Congress&apos; attention. Fresh from forging a compromise on the debt ceiling with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., announced that free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea would move forward in September. A bill on trade adjustment assistance (TAA) for the unemployed will be taken up separately.

It was a dramatic moment, because Reid has never met a free-trade agreement he liked. In his statement, he hastened to add that he wouldn&apos;t vote for the pacts himself. But there&apos;s no way he would have presented them if they would not be capable of passage, a Senate GOP staffer told IBD.

            <description>Middle East: Iraq will begin talks with the U.S. to have our military train Iraqi forces after the year-end withdrawal deadline. But will that save it from chaos and domination by terrorist Iran?

There was a bromide heard unceasingly from liberals before the voters followed their advice and replaced a &quot;cowboy president&quot; with a supposed diplomatic genius: &quot;The Iraqis must be forced to fend for themselves.&quot;

Candidate Barack Obama continually complained that President Bush &quot;refused time and again to tell the Iraqi government that we will not be there forever.&quot;

Former Vice President Al &quot;massive carbon footprint&quot; Gore has peddled an awful lot of nonsense, much of it dressed up in slick Hollywood packaging. The dishonest animation of man-made global warming sinking Florida into the Atlantic Ocean in his film &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; comes to mind.

Now Gore tells a once-prominent left-wing TV host that &quot;we need to have an American Spring ... nonviolent change, where people from the grass roots get involved again.&quot;

            <title>Iran Plans For A World Without America   8.4.11</title>
            <description>Defense: Tehran&apos;s navy deploys ships to the Atlantic capable of launching long-range missiles. This is not a joke. This is a dress rehearsal for the day an EMP attack ends our way of life.

&apos;Is it possible for us to witness a world without America and Zionism?&quot; Iran&apos;s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad asked at &quot;The World Without Zionism&quot; Tehran conference in 2005. &quot;But you had best know that this slogan and this goal are attainable, and surely can be achieved.&quot; He added that Iran had a &quot;war preparation plan&quot; for, as he put it, &quot;the destruction of Anglo-Saxon civilization.&quot;

Electromagnetic pulse, or EMP, is not a subject familiar to most Americans. But it&apos;s quite familiar to the Iranian military.

It&apos;s been practicing for the day when an Iranian missile tipped with a nuclear warhead lifts off from a vessel parked in international waters off our shores, the warhead detonating high above the American heartland, sending electromagnetic waves rippling across the American landscape, frying every electronic circuit within range.

In a July 18 statement, Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari said the Iranian navy plans on deploying warships in the Atlantic Ocean as part of a program to ply international waters.

            <title>This Too Will Pass   8.4.11</title>
            <description>Free Fall: The stock market is highly perceptive, and what it&apos;s perceiving now is that (1) the mediocre recovery of the last two years is stalling out and (2) our leaders in Washington haven&apos;t the vaguest idea of what to do about it.

A big part of this pathetic recovery has to be laid at government&apos;s doorstep. Our top elected and appointed officials try to blame it on everyone else, but it&apos;s their incompetence that has brought us low.

The weak 1.2% average GDP growth since the end of 2008 is a direct result of the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. And this was itself directly caused by the explosion in subprime loans — a policy of lending to non-creditworthy borrowers that dates all the way back to 1995.

Congress, the White House and bank regulators told banks then they would have to make as many as half their loans to people who couldn&apos;t pay them back. If they didn&apos;t comply, they could be sued, or denied a branch expansion or even a merger with another bank.

Using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as financing fronts, the government basically took over the private mortgage market. By 2008, Fannie and Freddie owned or originated half of the $12 trillion in U.S. mortgages.

            <itunes:summary>Free Fall: The stock market is highly perceptive, and what it&apos;s perceiving now is that (1) the mediocre recovery of the last two years is stalling out and (2) our leaders in Washington haven&apos;t the vaguest idea of what to do about it.

A big part of this pathetic recovery has to be laid at government&apos;s doorstep. Our top elected and appointed officials try to blame it on everyone else, but it&apos;s their incompetence that has brought us low.

The weak 1.2% average GDP growth since the end of 2008 is a direct result of the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. And this was itself directly caused by the explosion in subprime loans — a policy of lending to non-creditworthy borrowers that dates all the way back to 1995.

Congress, the White House and bank regulators told banks then they would have to make as many as half their loans to people who couldn&apos;t pay them back. If they didn&apos;t comply, they could be sued, or denied a branch expansion or even a merger with another bank.

Using Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as financing fronts, the government basically took over the private mortgage market. By 2008, Fannie and Freddie owned or originated half of the $12 trillion in U.S. mortgages.</itunes:summary>

            <title>An Unwelcome Debt Milestone   8.4.11</title>
            <description>Debt: Quietly, with the debt-ceiling imbroglio behind us, we&apos;ve entered a new era. And, no, that&apos;s not a good thing. Our debt now exceeds the size of our entire economy. Our economy won&apos;t be the same.

With this correction, the markets have issued a stinging rebuke to those who believed that with the debt-ceiling impasse resolved we can return to business as usual. We can&apos;t.

Those who carefully watch what the government does are no doubt alarmed it took just one day to raise the debt an additional $238 billion — or nearly 60% of that authorized by the debt-ceiling deal. Next week, we&apos;re expected to add yet $72 billion more.

With all this, we have passed a frightful milestone: Total debt of $14.58 trillion now exceeds gross domestic product, putting us on a near par with such overly indebted basket cases as Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland and Spain.

But that 100% of GDP is more than just a number.

            <title>Rogue EPA Targets Ozone — And Jobs  8.3.11</title>
            <description>Regulation: Unsupported by science, a beleaguered American economy may soon be subject to ozone standards so stringent that Yellowstone National Park could not meet them. Look forward to double-digit unemployment.

While the nation focused on the debt ceiling and its credit rating, the Environmental Protection Agency, which has become an unelected government unto itself, pondered a new way to impose rules that help explain why this economy cannot grow or create jobs and revenues.

High ozone levels can cause severe regulatory distress, but like other stuff in the atmosphere, there is a relatively safe level that can be obtained.

Then you run into the law of diminishing returns and reach a level beyond which health benefits are nonexistent or illusory, and costs exorbitant and job-killing.

On July 29, the EPA was set to pull the trigger on new regulations mandating a reduction in atmospheric ozone levels from the 75 parts per billion (ppb) established under the Bush administration to as low as 60 ppb. The EPA missed the deadline, but this particular sword still hangs over the neck of the U.S. economy.

            <title>The Real &apos;Uniters&apos;   8.3.11</title>
            <description>Governance: During the debt-ceiling debate, the Tea Party was called everything from cannibals to terrorists. In reality, the Tea Party did far better at getting bipartisan results than the &quot;Post-Partisan Uniter,&quot; President Obama.

In just the last few days, Vice President Biden called the tea party &quot;terrorists,&quot; New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd called them &quot;a maniac gang with big knives held high&quot; and the Arizona Daily Star ran a cartoon with Obama ordering Navy SEALs to kill tea party congressmen. And that&apos;s the civil stuff.

Meanwhile, pundits have talked endlessly about how dysfunctional and partisan Washington is thanks to the tea party radicals.

What was their sin? Well, near as we can figure, it was that the tea party managed to force Washington to confront a festering debt crisis that leaders had far too long ignored, and pushed for a credible plan that didn&apos;t kill the economy with new taxes, all of which produced a deal that got huge bipartisan support.

Wouldn&apos;t a better term for the tea party be &quot;uniters&quot;?

            <title>No Way To Treat A Dictator   8.3.11</title>
            <description>Rule Of Law: What does it say about the prospects for democracy in Egypt when its military rulers put former dictator Hosni Mubarak, caged and on a gurney, through a show trial? Very little, if history is any guide.

The Arab world is cringing with apprehension at the hasty, desperate trial of the former despot, who until February ruled Egypt with an iron hand for 30 years.

It&apos;s not that the charges against Mubarak — corruption and violence against protestors — are likely false. It&apos;s that this trial has all the earmarks of mob-pleasing revanchism that will shake citizens&apos; trust in democracy.

The 83-year-old has been rolled out on a gurney and placed in a cage to face charges slapped together over two months basically to humiliate him. He&apos;ll be tried by a notoriously politicized court system that hasn&apos;t been reformed to democratic norms since he left.

Having ruled the country with an iron fist for 30 years, it&apos;s no surprise democracy hasn&apos;t taken root. Nevertheless, for all but the Muslim Brotherhood, he was accepted by Egyptians as the law.

            <title>Editorial: Can We Stop China’s Cyber Attacks?   8.3.11</title>
            <description>Defense: America has been under nearly continuous attack for five years, yet we&apos;ve heard nary a peep about it. The reason? The attack is conducted by computers, not arms. Is this an act of war? And, if so, who&apos;s behind it?

A new report from the California-based security company McAfee says that a &quot;state actor&quot; is probably the source of the attacks on the U.S. and a host of other governments and international agencies, including Taiwan, India, Canada, the Olympics, the U.N. and the IMF, not to mention a number of private high-tech and defense firms.

&quot;Even we were surprised by the enormous diversity of the victim organizations and were taken aback by the audacity of the perpetrators,&quot; said the report&apos;s author, McAfee Vice President Dmitri Alperovitch.

But don&apos;t be deceived by that word &quot;diversity.&quot; A chart with the report shows that the overwhelming majority of targets were in the U.S. — 49 cyber targets here vs. 23 in the rest of the world.

So who&apos;s the culprit? It&apos;s pretty clear that China has both the means and the motive. And analysts say a lot of the hard evidence points to that nation.

            <title>Heading For A Double-Dip Recession?  8.2.11</title>
            <description>Recession: A day after purchasing managers reported an &quot;unexpected&quot; slump in manufacturing, another surprise report shows consumer spending falling for the first time in nearly two years. Double dip, anyone?

Despite the largest Keynesian spending splurge in the history of the planet, the economy continues to founder.

The last two years&apos; &quot;stimulus&quot; — meant to get consumers and businesses humming again — was in excess of 10% of GDP, an unheard of economic intervention, exceeding even FDR&apos;s during the Depression.

Tragically, the result has been the same: failure. Indeed, if anything, trillions of dollars of federal stimulus seems to have damaged hopes for a rebound.

With joblessness at 9.2%, the manufacturing sector showing signs of decline and consumers on the ropes, it&apos;s time to consider that we might be lapsing into recession again — a little over two years after we emerged from the last one.

Just weeks ago, many economists were convinced the second half of 2011 would be bullishly strong, with higher auto output, a bottoming in home sales and prices, and perhaps even a modest pickup in jobs. Today that scenario doesn&apos;t look so likely.

            <title>Doing Well In D.C.    8.2.11</title>
            <description>Budget Impact: When you pump $3.6 trillion through one part of the country, a lot of that money invariably spills out. So it&apos;s no wonder that metropolitan Washington, D.C., residents are terrified of spending cuts.

If the house organ of big government — the Washington Post — is any indication, the D.C. region is more than a bit worried that those darn Tea Party radicals might actually succeed in reining in federal spending.

On Tuesday, the Post ran two big stories about the hazards of budget cuts. One warned that spending reductions included in the debt deal signed by President Obama would &quot;threaten to aggravate the basic problems facing the U.S. economy.&quot; The other fretted that defense cutbacks could &quot;put the region&apos;s economy at risk.&quot;

Well, to be fair, these folks do have a good reason to worry. After all, big government has been very, very good to the D.C. region. Consider:

VWashington and its environs have seen a steady increase in jobs over the past 2 1/2 years. In Arlington County, Va., employment climbed 3%, while nationwide the workforce shrank.

Well, to be fair, these folks do have a good reason to worry. After all, big government has been very, very good to the D.C. region. Consider:

VWashington and its environs have seen a steady increase in jobs over the past 2 1/2 years. In Arlington County, Va., employment climbed 3%, while nationwide the workforce shrank.</itunes:summary>

            <title>Next Time, Try Real Reform   8.2.11</title>
            <description>Health Care: Wasn&apos;t the spending curve supposed to bend down? Isn&apos;t that what we were promised when the president and his party set out to maul our medical care system. So why will spending double by 2020?

Congress needed to pass the Democrats&apos; health care &quot;reform&quot; because the law would bend the cost curve downward, Obama frequently said while campaigning for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.

But the president&apos;s promise won&apos;t translate into reality.

According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, under ObamaCare, health care spending will grow by 5.8% a year through 2020. That&apos;s 1.1 percentage points faster than it would grow if Washington had done nothing.

This means that our health care spending will grow from 17.6% of the economy in 2009 to 19.8% in 2020, when total expenditures will be more than $4 trillion.

So what did Obama know and when did he know it about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act? It&apos;s hard to believe he wasn&apos;t aware from the beginning that the law would increase costs. If he didn&apos;t know it, then he&apos;s not intellectually fit to be president. If he did know that costs would increase, yet continued to say the legislation would cut costs, he&apos;s morally unfit for the office he occupies.

            <title>Beware The &apos;Supercommittee&apos;   8.2.11</title>
            <description>Budget Policy: Congress&apos; debt-ceiling deal kicked the can over to a special bipartisan &quot;supercommittee&quot; that will make big decisions on spending cuts and taxes. Will that panel be top-heavy with liberals?

There is a lot to fear from the establishment of an umpteenth blue-ribbon commission designed to solve another dilemma said to be beyond the reach of the ordinary legislative procedures of the U.S. government.

One such recent supercommittee of sorts, the 2006 Iraq Study Group, recommended another Vietnam-style surrender for the U.S.; then-President George W. Bush turned the tables with Gen. David Petraeus&apos; successful Iraq surge initiative.

Tea Party activists are properly worried about Congress&apos; new supercommittee duping the public into accepting tax hikes and phantom spending reform.

FreedomWorks Vice President Max Pappas, for instance, charged last week that &quot;Speaker Boehner is using the committee as a facade for potential tax increases down the road without having to commit to anything on paper right now while the debate is hot. So essentially, the supercommittee is the tax hike.&quot;

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, meanwhile, is mocking &quot;Republican leaders in the Senate saying there will be no revenue.&quot; According to Reid, &quot;that&apos;s not going to happen&quot; because &quot;this joint committee&quot; will agree to politically &quot;painful&quot; tax increases.

            <title>Illinois&apos; Bad Dream   8.2.11</title>
            <description>Immigration: An insolvent state hemorrhaging jobs enacts its version of the federal DREAM Act, holding out another carrot to illegal aliens by setting up a college scholarship fund for their children.

Illinois&apos; Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn on Monday illustrated why liberals tend to run governments and economies into the ground by signing into law Monday the Illinois DREAM (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors) Act, a seemingly innocuous and compassionate piece of legislation that sets up scholarships for anyone with a Social Security number or taxpayer identification number.

At a time when the Land of Lincoln is driving away business and jobs through increasingly burdensome taxation, liberal ideology trumps practicality by seeking to attract illegal immigrants to a state struggling to meet the needs of its citizens.

It seeks to educate the children of illegal aliens to compete for jobs American citizens can&apos;t find. An estimated 95,000 children of illegal aliens will benefit.

            <title>Must Defense Bear The Brunt?   8.1.11</title>
            <description>Spending: A military veteran and freshman congressman says slashing defense as part of a budget deal would be &quot;unconscionable.&quot; Providing for the common defense is a constitutional imperative, not discretionary spending.

The deal that&apos;s being called the Budget Control Act of 2011 provides for $900 billion in deficit reduction over 10 years through discretionary spending caps. Some $350 billion of that comes from the Pentagon and our national defense. Since when has defense become &quot;discretionary&quot; spending?

Defense of this nation is an imperative mentioned in the very first line of the U.S. Constitution: &quot;We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense ... &quot; We read nothing about a AAA credit rating.

            <description>Spending: After months of talk about the nation&apos;s runaway debt, lawmakers managed to agree on a plan that, at most, will cut spending by a mere 5%. Is it any wonder federal spending is out of control?

Some of the reactions to the agreement hammered out by Republicans and the White House over the weekend would make you think the federal government was in for some serious downsizing.

President Obama says the deal will produce &quot;the lowest level of annual domestic spending since Dwight Eisenhower was president.&quot; The media talk about &quot;sharp&quot; and &quot;deep&quot; spending cuts, while liberals wail about the inhumanity of it all.
