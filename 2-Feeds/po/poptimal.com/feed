<p>Nintendo and Intelligent Systems are teaming up to bring Wario and his Diamond City friends back for their premiere on the Wii U in <em>Game and Wario</em> (Title in Progress). Fans of the <em>WarioWare </em>series will be happy to hear that the new game will retain the original flair and character of the micro-games.</p>
<p>Slated to release within the launch window, the 1-5 player game will offer many different games to play, four of which have already been announced.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WiiU_GameWario_1_scrn01_E3.bmp"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-79180" title="WiiU_GameWario_1_scrn01_E3" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WiiU_GameWario_1_scrn01_E3.bmp" alt="" width="277" height="434" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Arrow</strong> – This single-player game transforms the GamePad into a hi-tech bow (shaped like Wario’s mustache, of course) and arrow designed to defeat swarming enemies. Players hold the GamePad vertically with one hand to aim at enemies on the TV screen, while using their other hand to pull the arrow on the GamePad’s touch screen.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn02_E3.bmp"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-79181" title="WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn02_E3" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn02_E3.bmp" alt="" width="277" height="434" /></a></p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Ski</strong> – In this single-player game, competitors must lead the skier to the finish line by holding the GamePad vertically and tilting it left or right. The TV monitor will show the skier’s flashy moves to entertain the audience.</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn03_E3.bmp"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-79182" title="WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn03_E3" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn03_E3.bmp" alt="" width="461" height="518" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Shutter</strong> – In this single-player game, the player must use the GamePad like a telephoto camera lens to take photos of criminals hidden in the town before the time runs out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn04_E3.bmp"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-79183" title="WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn04_E3" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/WiiU_GameWario_2_scrn04_E3.bmp" alt="" width="461" height="518" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Fruit</strong> – In this game for two to five players, the main player uses the GamePad to anonymously control one of many characters on the TV screen to quietly steal some fruit scattered all over the town. Once the thief completes the mission, the player passes the GamePad to the other players, who then must try to finger the suspect.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">

<p>The heavy hitters from Microsoft had the honor of kicking off the conference portion of E3 with a slew of new, innovative products and ideas that promised to make this the biggest and most important year for the titan that is the Xbox 360. Beyond the big stage, only a sea of glowing laptops could be seen scattered throughout the dark auditorium, populated primarily by industry experts there to report the facts. However, we all realize what a huge production E3 has become, being viewed via televisions, internet, and Xbox consoles globally by consumers as well as the insiders and Microsoft did it’s best to entertain everyone with an insanely packed, fully interactive and celebrity enhanced  presentation.</p>
<p>First thing is first: would there be a named successor to the Xbox 360? Rumors have been flying rampantly for months now over possible announcements for a new console from Microsoft, but you can put those ideas to bed because they had bigger dragons to slay this year. These days it’s become less of a race to have the next big console and more of a competition to expand existing platforms with add-ons applications and updates. As Microsoft Studios vice president Phil Spencer mentioned right out of the gate, the Xbox 360 has gone from the biggest selling console in North America to the biggest in the world now. With that huge statement being said, I suppose what’s the sense in fixing what’s not broken (or a glowing red ring)? The fact that Microsoft can keep its products relevant for longer periods of time shows just how times have changed for everyone. The industry is hardly at a stand-still; it’s constantly evolving with every year. So just what did Microsoft have the world buzzing most about at their conference? Here are the major highlights:</p>
<p><strong><em>Halo 4 </em></strong>- If they wanted to immediately draw the crowd in from the get-go, then the introduction to the upcoming <em>Halo 4</em> was the way to do it. The <em>Halo</em> franchise has been a fan favorite from the birth of the Xbox and gamers everywhere has been dying to see if the next installment will live up to their excruciatingly high expectations, especially with the absence of Bungie this time around. Pristine graphics aside, gameplay looked pretty amazing and Microsoft seemed to successfully rile up the crowd with the return of Master Chief, yet reviews were still very mixed. With die-hard fans on one side and cynics on the other, <em>Halo 4</em> still managed to make the exciting splash that it hoped for as the show’s opener with primarily positive praises.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QyUgGOqkdnc" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong><em>Xbox SmartGlass </em></strong>- Not mentioning this brand spanking new creation would be like forgetting that the entire Microsoft presentation ever happened. It was without a doubt the only thing bigger and more important than <em>Halo 4</em> and with good reason. Here is a prime example of one of those add-on applications that promises to enhance your Xbox experience whether it be watching movies, playing games, or just about anything else, turning “any TV into a smart TV”. In a nutshell, <em>SmartGlass</em> connects any device, with heavy emphasis on <em>any</em>, to your Xbox to allow you to toggle between devices like your tablet and your television with simplicity and ease. Or perhaps you’d like to make your handy iPhone even handier by using it as a remote that acts as a computer mouse while browsing the web on your television? Well, with <em>SmartGlass</em>, this all becomes possible. While playing a game on your Xbox, <em>SmartGlass</em> can be used as a secondary controller and display with the main purpose of keeping you in the know with game related information (like when achievements have been unlocked or messages from online friends pop up) without interrupting gameplay on the big screen. However, the general consensus still seems to be that of befuddlement and skepticism since the presentation left many unanswered questions as far as the application’s practicality, as well as functionality, and a worry that executing such a huge idea may be harder for Microsoft than they’re making it look. <em>SmartGlass</em> is just another step in the direction towards interactive gaming, however, the jury is still officially out on this one.</p>
<p><strong><em>A Slightly More Interesting Kinect </em></strong>- The poor Kinect still can’t seem to gain nearly as much momentum as its motion-sensored competitor, the Wii, so Microsoft brought literally everything it could possibly dream up to the table this year.  Recently, everything Kinect-based has been largely centered around physical movements but I’m thrilled that Microsoft is finding more, interesting ways to utilize the system and make it worthwhile to a wider market. Voice commands were a huge focus this year for both gaming and for Xbox console control. During the new <em>Splinter Cell: Black List</em> demo, they were able to show how someone can interact with characters in the game by calling out to them and getting reactions, immersing the player further than ever before. Controlling applications like Bing search and your Netflix subscription on your console by voice versus controller is supposed to make things even easier if you were to, let’s say, suddenly lose your thumbs. Sure, the voice option leaves one feeling fancy and technologically advanced but it’s simply a novelty and not a necessity at this stage. Some classic Kinect action was back, too, with the <em>Dance Central 3</em> debut and live stage show from Usher who helped the developers design the dancing aspect of the game firsthand. The athletic behemoth Nike partnered up with Microsoft to develop the Nike+ Kinect training program, taking the fitness gaming fad to the ultimate level. Although the Nike feature is a superbly well-thought out idea with new ways to gauge one’s progression and keep the participants motivated, it wasn’t nearly as exciting as having Usher come out on stage and grab his crotch under strobe lights. Microsoft is obviously reaching out, wisely, in an effort to add another branch to its demographic but, in my very own personal experience, I can barely make it up a full flight of stairs without getting winded so you can count me out for any Nike-based intensity workouts. We’ll see how many people agree with my sentiment down the road.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://cdn.playwire.com/11904/embed/88555.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong><em>The Gaming Entertainment </em></strong>- It was sequels galore this E3 with few real new titles, however, a lot of the great existing franchises were back. Besides <em>Halo 4</em>, we finally got some closer looks at other anticipated titles such as <em>Gears of War: Judgement</em> and the previously rumored <em>Splinter Cell: Black List</em>. <em>Call of Duty</em> is back with a futuristic <em>Black Ops 2</em> and, yes, EA once again managed to pump out another <em>Madden</em> game, <em>Madden 13</em>. The biggest hubbub surrounding <em>Madden 13</em> is being able to combine it with the new <em>SmartGlass</em> app to make customized plays. Yawn. Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil 6</em> demoed exciting new zombie action on the stage and Crystal Dynamics showed  a more in depth look at Lara Croft’s world with their newly reimagined prequel, <em>Tomb Raider</em>. Finally, the boys over at <em>South Park</em> were roped into creating a game based on their cartoon which Trey Parker and Matt Stone revealed briefly on the Microsoft stage. <em>South Park: The Stick of Truth</em> is animated in the exact style of the Comedy Central show, with the intent of making the players feel like they are in an episode of <em>South Park</em>.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Non-gaming Entertainment </em></strong>- Microsoft was proud to announce the various other ways they’d be expanding their services for home entertainment along with the voice search option. Thirty-five new content partners were revealed including Nickelodeon, Machinima, and Univision. Soon sports fans will have total ESPN overload with the Xbox bringing just about every NBA, NHL, and MLB live televised game throughout the year, as well as UFC events. Xbox will also offer live ESPN broadcasts in HD every day, all day. Determined not to let music endeavors die with Zune, Xbox Music service was introduced, boasting a library of 30 million songs with hopes of rivaling Apple’s iTunes.  Internet Explorer and Windows 8 were also announced as coming soon for web browsing via Xbox along with the Bing voice search being extended to twelve additional countries.</p>
<p>As the number one gaming console in the world right now, Microsoft continues to push forward at warp speed and shows no signs of slowing down. They did their best to turn even the most mundane or menial announcements into an exciting experience and succeeded at pulling off an overall superior press conference for E3 2012 that should have everyone looking forward to what’s to come.</p>

<p>In the early morning hours in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, Nintendo gathered thousands inside the Nokia Theater for their annual E3 press conference, which had all the impact and lasting effect as a wet fart let loose from the bowels of some drunken asshole who can’t for the life of him remember what exactly he ate last night, but he knows it was pretty bad.</p>
<p>After a short video intro featuring a group of Pikmin, Fanboy King Miyamoto took the stage to introduce the press conference with his usual cheeriness. At this point, it seemed that the centerpiece of the event would be Nintendo’s new console, the WiiU, however it turns out that the focus would be on software rather than hardware. “It’s all about games,” Reggie Fils-Aime expressed after he took the stage, promising that during the event we would see over twenty-three different WiiU games, all in various stages of development. That statistic might have ultimately been true, but did little to instill confidence in much of anyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/VB4_7043.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-79161" title="Shigeru Miyamoto" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/VB4_7043-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>The first game shown was <em>Pikmin 3</em>, which used the functionality of the WiiU controller’s touchscreen as a secondary map interface, where if you click on an area displayed on the large overhead map of the level, the in-game camera on the actual television would snap to the area selected on the controller.</p>
<p>Next, was MiiVerse, which is Nintendo’s attempt at creating a Home-style interface/hub for WiiU players to interact much like they would if using a DS, including typing, sending images, and drawing with the stylus. Home on paper had a ton of promise to it, but no one seems to use it for much of anything, so the hope is that Nintendo will learn from Sony’s mistakes and make the MiiVerse a go-to spot once the console is fired up.</p>
<p><em>New Super Mario Bros. U </em>continued the roll out of games and a brief preview of what it had to offer showed that New Super Mario Bros. sure as shit looked a lot like Old Super Mario Bros. Making it clear that their newest “innovation” is being supported by third parties, Nintendo then unveiled <em>Batman Arkham City: Armored Edition</em>, an updated version of the 2011 hit that has been retrofitted to use the WiiU’s unique control scheme. While this sounds all fun and good, the WiiU’s controller still continued to seem like an after-thought, with the bulk of the functionality revolving around lock picking mini games and controlling the remote batarang with the gyroscope. Compare that to the versatility of a game like <em>Uncharted: Golden Abyss</em> which has players making charcoal rubbings, holding parchment up to real-world light sources, cleaning artifacts for clues, throwing grenades and more.</p>
<p>In fact, the only WiiU game that showed any promise was Ubisoft’s <em>ZombiU</em>. The first person shooter seems to use the WiiU’s touch screen as a sort of Augmented Reality viewer in which the player needs to hold the controller up to the screen and interacts with the environment in a new and unique way. Say I’m looting a particular area but don’t want to dig through all the garbage since getting my brains eaten is in the immediate future; I need only hold up the WiiU controller to the screen and a “wire image” x-ray version of the environment is exposed for me and I can now see through a dumpster and pull out some much-needed ammunition. Another neat touch had the player accessing inventory items on the controller screen while the playable character on the main screen took a knee and started digging through his backpack. Styling the touch screen as an additional layer of main gameplay is perhaps the smartest move a developer has yet to make with the WiiU and demonstrates that aspects of the hardware have potential.</p>
<p>Games did continue to roll out in the form of new <em>Scribblenauts</em>, <em>Darksiders</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em>, <em>Tekken</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, and <em>Aliens: Colonial Marines</em>, all tweaked for the system’s special control scheme. Other titles showcased in long-form continued to be middling at best. <em>WiiFitU</em> awkwardly has players placing the controller at the foot of the familiar balance board, making the prospect of getting too aggressive and stepping on your brand new controller a very scary probability. <em>SiNG</em> was another misfire, giving players the “luxury” of not only holding the WiiU controller which displays lyrics, but also holding a mic and singing at the same time. You see, this allows the singer to face the audience and not the TV screen and is in no way meant to feel awkward or cumbersome.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/VB2_5136.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-79160" title="Katsuya Eguchi" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/VB2_5136-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></a>By the time the conference wrapped, the oversights on Nintendo’s part were glaring. Namely, where was Zelda and what is the release date and price point of the WiiU? After being demoed on the floor of last year’s E3, people were expecting, nay all but demanding more information on a game that is expected to be a launch title, but at today’s presentation, it was as if it never even existed. Also equally astounding was the lack of <em>any</em> information on the hardware of the WiiU other than what was already revealed last summer. The fact that no pricing or even a release date was announced for a console that is supposed to be out this year makes Nintendo’s proposed emphasis on games feel like a slight spin on the woefully cloudy status of their newest hardware endeavor. All the more suspect because Nintendo has always announced their new hardware with fanfare and confidence, even the semi-maligned 3DS.</p>
<p>Which begs the question, is the WiiU controller already a moot point? Did Nintendo let the cat out of the bag too early by announcing it last year? Possibly. Especially when Sony and Microsoft are talking up controlling games with the Vita and integrating “SmartGlass” technology into the experience, respectively. Both proprietary concepts essentially create the WiiU play experience on consoles that overpower Nintendo’s and has a much more hardcore fanbase.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo left everyone with many questions, one thing we did take from the conference is that it feels like they dropped the ball in a major way. Most of the software announcements were ho-hum and were expected which, piled onto the lack of hearing anything remotely close to what media expectations were, took the focus off the WiiU and felt way more like an F-U. Let’s hope they don’t botch the launch of the WiiU as badly as their conference or it might be out of the frying pan and into the fire for fanboy gamers untouchable content provider.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-79151" title="rhonj 7.6" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/rhonj-7.6-300x209.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="209" />While there are many things that happened on this week’s RHONJ, Juicy Guidice’s douchiness is the main take-a-way. Let me fast forward through the recap so we can talk about that fact some more.</p>
<p>We start with Milania giving Gia the third degree about who she’s texting. When Gia denies it’s her boyfriend (which, it totally is), Melania calls her out on it and Gia proceeds to gives her sister the biggest stinkeye glare possible. Melania then takes a giant bite out of the raw turkey leg she likes to chomp on and runs away.</p>
<p>Next, we have a heart-to-heart between Tre and Gia. Tre tries to flush out why Gia had such an insanely spastic meltdown at Field Day and gets nowhere. When Tre asks Gia for suggestions on how to squelch the feud with Joe, Gia blows her nose. Enough said.</p>
<p>This week’s episode touches a lot on coming out of the closet. Both Caroline and Cousin Kathy have siblings who went through difficult times in order to find themselves and become comfortable in their own skin. Very courageous and commendable. In Caroline’s case, her brother Jaime struggled with his identity for a long time and is now marrying the man of his dreams. For Cousin Kathy, her sister Rosie who has made regular appearance on the show (and is one of the few people I actually really like) spent over a decade processing, accepting, and embracing her sexuality and is now enjoying her life and looking for the right gal to come along (in the meantime, she’ll take Cliff Robinson’s bombshell of a wife!). It’s interesting how when you juxtapose (is that word WAY too large for a RHONJ recap article?) real life struggles (i.e. Jaime and Rosie’s) against the asinine drama that encases the ladies of Franklin LAKES (I got it this time, people) from week to week, RHONJ turns into dog poo.</p>
<p>Next up, we see Joe suggest therapy to Tre who balks at the idea. Old school Italians don’t believe in therapy, she declares. Her witchy friend Kim D. agrees (of course) and proceeds to espouse that it’s Joey that has the problem. If course it’s Joe. It’s not like Tre was flipping tables or anything prior to her feud with her brother. At any rate, Teresa’s not into this “physical therapy” B.S.</p>
<p>Now, onto Juicy’s homophobia and all around inappropriateness. In an effort to demonstrate how he welcomes gays and lesbians with open arms, he first dons a blazer with no undershirt or pants and declares it’s the perfect outfit for a gay wedding. First moment where I wished a UFC fighter would knock him out. Next, while at Jaime’s wedding in Chicago, he recalls his own “gay” moment, “when I was a kid, me and my friend were hanging out in my pool, and we&#8217;re talking about whose got a bigger penis. We end up somehow taking our penis&#8217; out and seeing who has got a bigger penis! So now we&#8217;re both lying next to each other, we both have our penises out like two gays, and he probably beat me like by an inch. Actually the kid&#8217;s name was Jaime!&#8221; Second moment where I wished a UFC would just appear and high kick Joe to pieces. Lastly, on the way home from Jaime’s rehearsal dinner, he accuses Greg (Albie and Chris’ roomie who is openly gay) of farting in the van. Juicy deduces that it has to be Greg because why? Oh, because Greg has the “loosest butthole here.” Third moment where I wished a UFC fighter would come in and punch Juicy in the nuts.</p>
<p>So, Tre declares that Juicy is not “anti’-gay.” Well, maybe he isn’t but he has a weird way of demonstrating he’s not. And Tre does a great job just laughing with her idiot husband. They are both total losers in that regard (among many other regards).</p>
<p>I’ll end this week’s recap with a wish – I wish Caroline more on-screen time WITH make-up. The au natural version we saw this week was not ok because she looks more curmudgeony (sp?) that she actually is (by a tad).</p>
<p>Adios!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, I have brought this up MANY times before to friends and family, but let&#8217;s discuss this right here and now, shall we? The title of the show. <em>America&#8217;s Got Talent. </em>That is awful grammar. The correct way to say that sentence is <em>America Has Talent. </em>I guess that doesn&#8217;t quite have the same ring to it, though, and it also doesn&#8217;t allow host Nick Cannon to stand atop various structures, screaming like a lunatic: &#8220;Does America GOT talent?&#8221; No, Nick! and America needs some lessons in the English language &#8211; stat!</p>
<p>Aside from butchering America&#8217;s language, the show continued its audition process in Tampa Bay, Florida and St. Louis, Missouri, where various odd things took place. Per usual, the audience in both cities was completely hopped up on crack sugar, and unbelievably loud, obnoxious, and way too excited over <em>every</em>  thing. The producers continue to feed the audiences sugar to keep them screaming throughout the auditions and make things interesting. Apparently,  <em>America&#8217;s Got Twinkies. </em></p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-79144" title="AGT 7.5 image" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/AGT-7.5-image-300x220.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="220" />TAMPA BAY, FLORIDA &#8211; Memorable Moments</strong></p>
<p>To start things off, we had the young, non-profit choral and dance group <strong>Inspire the Fire</strong> kick things off with their intriguing mix of hip-hop, street dancing, and singing. Stern said &#8220;I hate <em>Glee, </em>but I love you!&#8221; while the other judges found the group to be phenomenal and put them through.</p>
<p>One lowlight of the auditions was watching <strong>The Bikini Bombshells, </strong>who pretty much did nothing except shake their asses in tiny bikinis. They were so pointless, even Stern, who loves half-naked women, mocked them, saying &#8220;My aunt Sally, who is dead now, at 95 years old, moved better than you girls.&#8221; Howie Mandel, on the other hand, quipped &#8220;Even though you&#8217;re really terrible, atrocious, have no talent whatsoever; I still loved it.&#8221; Despite Howie putting the 4 girls through, Sharon and Stern did not and they went home to continue their pointless lives.</p>
<p><strong>All That </strong>was a really interesting group of clog-dancers. What made them interesting? They were a group of 7 adult men who looked more like construction workers than dancers. The crowd loved it (of course), as did Sharon, saying: &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen an all-male, tattooed, burly looking clogging group before.&#8221; The men made it to Vegas.</p>
<p>Another lowlight that provided some moments of hilarity was the escape artist <strong>Michael Griffin. </strong>His big act was sitting in a chair and having Stern come up onstage and tie him up with 35 feet of rope and then escape from it. Stern took an immediate dislike to the annoying guy and talked all the way through tying him up. &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna tie up your mouth so you&#8217;ll shut up already! You are really annoying me. Why are you having ME tie you up? I&#8217;m not an expert knot-tier. What does this prove? This is stupid!&#8221; The man got out of the ropes by shaking his body and writhing around, then finally falling off the chair to the stage until the ropes came free. Howie Mandel pointed out &#8220;your nitch is that you get out of nothing.&#8221; He did not make it on.</p>
<p>One of my personal favorite acts was <strong>The Distinguished Men of Brass, </strong>a large group of professional looking middle-aged and older men in suits, playing a brass band, complete with conductor. They were well-choreographed and very entertaining, and they created the band when they could no longer find themselves other jobs in this bad economy. Sharon said &#8220;I adore you&#8221; and put them through along with the other judges.</p>
<p>The singer <strong>Ulysses </strong>provided a lot of silly entertainment with his singing of numerous TV theme songs. That&#8217;s his thing. He sings TV theme songs. He has a pretty good voice, but I&#8217;m not quite sure how on earth that would make a good show in Las Vegas. Plus, he looked like a platypus or a Weeble in a Cosby sweater. With Fat Albert hair. Or Don King. The dude looked odd. Stern gave him the buzz halfway through the &#8220;Love Boat&#8221; theme, then asked him if he knew &#8220;Green Acres&#8221; and got a kick out of hearing that one. Then he, along with the judges and the loopy crowd, broke into &#8220;The Addams Family,&#8221; complete with all the snapping. In the end, Nick Cannon came out and joined in on the fun, but the Weeble did not make it to the next round.</p>
<p><strong>ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI &#8211; Memorable Moments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Isaac Brown </strong>got the crowd on his side right away. Why? Because he is a 6 year old boy, and America looooooves kids! This kid was very personable, and funny, and had an average singing voice on a Jackson 5 song. However, the judges and crowd ate  him up like pie and put him through to Vegas. He was very cute and good; it&#8217;s just one of those times where I felt the audience went a more insane with cheering and clapping than the performance actually deserved.</p>
<p>At 26, <strong>Spencer Horsman </strong>is the youngest Escape Artist in the World, or so he claims. His act was getting out of a hanging, frightening looking contraption that burned fire seconds after his final escape. Stern joked that he loved it, but would not be happy &#8220;until I see you kill yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-79145" title="AGT 7.6 image" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/AGT-7.6-image.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="260" />Another humorous moment happened when a man who is known as <strong>Little Ozzy </strong>took the stage. He was little, and he looked as much like Ozzy Ozbourne as a person can look. Known worldwide for his performances as Ozzy, his goal was to get Sharon&#8217;s attention. He did that by singing a song called &#8220;Mama I&#8217;m Comin&#8217; Home&#8221; that Ozzy wrote for Sharon. Even though the crowd booed him and he was not that great, Sharon got teary-eyed because she was missing her husband, who is away, and so the song made her emotional. The man got a hug from Sharon, but did not get through to Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Cut Throat Freak Show </strong>was the perfect example of the type of act I simply cannot stomach or watch. Holy Hell. They walked barefoot through broken glass, jumped on the glass, swallowed a sword, and one man lifted a chair off the ground using ONLY HIS EYELIDS!!!! The chair was hooked up to some sort of chain-like thing and then he . . . well . . . I stopped watching. Stern laughed his head off and found it &#8220;engaging,&#8221; Sharon was like me and couldn&#8217;t watch, and Mandel put them through. They went to Vegas.</p>
<p>There wasn&#8217;t really a great big moment in this week&#8217;s episodes, at least not one that I found to be great. Nothing super emotional or where you just went &#8220;Wow!&#8221; They are either saving the really good stuff for later, or they don&#8217;t have any. So far, there are a lot of good acts, and a lot of intriguing acts, but nothing I feel like is <em>amazing </em>. . . yet. But <em>America&#8217;s Got Time. </em></p>
<p> Season 7, Episode 5-6: Tampa Bay &amp; St. Louis (original airdates May 28 &amp; 29, 2012).</p>
<p>America’s Got Talent airs Monday and Tuesday nights at 8/7c on NBC.</p>

<p>Ubisoft&#8217;s unveiling of <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed III Liberation</em> for the Playstation Vita marks the franchises first full-fledged experience on a handheld device. Debuted during Sony&#8217;s E3 Press Conference, the trailer for <em>Liberation </em>gave gamers their first look at the new female assassin Aveline as she took on Spanish forces in 1768 New Orleans. While the trailer showed off action sequences from the game, not much was said or shown in terms of story. In a developer Q&amp;A with Ubisoft Producer Martin Capel, background and story details shed light on the Templar movement in New Orleans and Aveline&#8217;s background.</p>
<p><strong>Aveline</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Set in New Orleans between 1765 and 1780 <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed III Liberation </em>will introduce Aveline, the half French, half African female assassin. Growing up as the daughter of wealthy French merchant and an African placée bride, Aveline&#8217;s privileged lifestyle causes her to take notice of the contrasting lifestyles in New Orleans &#8211; wealth and poverty, freedom and slavery. She forms her own set of values, taking a &#8220;vehement anti-slavery stance&#8221; as Capel puts it, causing her to be recruited by Agate, an escaped slave, to join the Assassin movement.</p>
<p>Capel describes the time period of Aveline&#8217;s recruitment as one full of turmoil. &#8220;Aveline joins the struggle against the Templars as they try to take control of New Orleans following France’s handover of the city to Spain. Striking hard and fast, she is instrumental in the Louisiana Rebellion that forces the Spanish and Templars out of the city for nearly two years before they return in force.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American Revolution in the North will also have an effect on the heroine. &#8220;With the British colonies to the north moving closer towards Revolution, Aveline is forced to reconsider her values as she strives against the Templars and slavery and the world she knows is gradually dragged into yet another war.&#8221;</p>
<p>From their very first discussions Ubisoft had kept the possibility of a female assassin open. According to Capel, New Orleans in the 18th Century presented a unique opportunity due the diversity of the city. This allowed several women to acquire positions of wealth, power and respect within the city.  It was these women that ended up serving as a role model that sculpted Aveline into &#8220;a strong, empowered young woman with the opportunity, confidence and willpower to be ruthless in achieving her goals.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/120604_7pm_ACL_SC_SP_07_HD_NewOrleans_Pursuit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-79123" title="120604_7pm_ACL_SC_SP_07_HD_NewOrleans_Pursuit" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/120604_7pm_ACL_SC_SP_07_HD_NewOrleans_Pursuit-1024x580.jpg" alt="" width="553" height="313" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>
<p>Developed by Ubisoft Sofia, Capel revealed that <em>Liberation</em> will offer &#8220;an open world game with strong narrative and characters, cities bursting with life and fully explorable, complete free-running abilities, combat with a full arsenal of different weapons, stealth, pretty much everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ubisoft Sofia kept the handheld nature of the Vita in mind when it came to designing missions.  <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> fans can expect missions they can complete in short bursts for an on the go experience. According to Capel, the length of the game will last 15 hours for experienced gamers and up to 20 hours for the typical gamer.</p>
<p>When it comes to combat, Aveline will bring a mix of flair and precision using melee combat, hidden blades, pistols, and her silent, deadly blowpipe. Capel also confirmed that Aveline will be able to wield two weapons at the same time in <em>Liberation, </em>a feature that also will be seen in <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed 3</em> combat system.</p>
<p>Aveline&#8217;s social status will also effect the gameplay, but Capel couldn&#8217;t speak more on it till a later date. He did confirm that unique activities such as Mardi Gras will take place in the game.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Bayou will bring a variety of wild animals many that Capel labeled as a threat. The most dangerous animal according to Ubisoft &#8211; the alligator. &#8220;These wait on the banks of the swamp or cruise the waters looking for prey, and will attack people whenever they can.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bayou&#8217;s swamp like nature will be dangerous to traverse, making trees the safest and fastest way to get across. Even though the alligator threat is left below, Ubisoft promises the Bayou will have a threat of its own. &#8220;Within this region, the player will encounter smugglers and other outcasts from New Orleans, living in their own settlements and following their own rules.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know about you, but the Louisiana Bayou doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun place to be.</p>
<p>Capel also confirmed that Avaline will be crossing the Gulf to Mexico, but no further details were given.</p>
<p>The biggest tease came in the form of a news of a potential crossover with the console version of the game. Capel mentions Aveline will encounter Connor during her story, but wouldn&#8217;t comment on it any further.</p>
<p><strong>Abstergo</strong></p>
<p>The Templar&#8217;s presence in <em>Liberation </em>is meta. The game itself is actually a product of Abstergo. &#8220;<em>Liberation</em> is different from main Assassin Creed games in that it is an Abstergo product where the player is playing in the Animus, rather than playing an Assassin through the Animus. The game has been released as a propaganda tool by Abstergo, who want players to experience a gray area of the Assassin/Templar conflict as an Assassin rather than a Templar.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Multiplayer</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft Sofia will have a Vita specific tailored multiplayer mode, but they aren&#8217;t planning on revealing it at E3.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/episode-12-megan-sally.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-79113" title="episode-12-megan-sally" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/episode-12-megan-sally-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>If there was ever an episode of <em><a href="http://poptimal.com/tv-shows/dramas/mad-men/" target="_blank">Mad Men</a> </em>that was just a pure punch to the gut it would be this week&#8217;s. In many ways we should have seen this coming and maybe even the characters should have seen this coming, but no one did. Not like this anyway. Not this quick. Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce has lost one of its namesakes and frankly I find that heartbreaking.</p>
<p>It was just a few weeks ago when Lane Pryce&#8217;s financial woes pushed him to do the unthinkable by stealing from his own company. Sure, he saw it as merely a loan that he intended to pay back, but without a Christmas bonus coming his way the forging of Don&#8217;s signature on a check was the forging of his own demise. The check was discovered as we all knew it would be (by Bert Cooper of all people) and Don is forced to handle it.</p>
<p>Its interesting that Don, the king of duplicity, has to deal with an issue that ultimately boils down to trust and honesty. When he confronts Lane about the theft and is essentially begged to let him stay on and make it right, Don&#8217;s simple response is that he can&#8217;t trust Lane anymore. And with that Lane is forced to resign and Don gives him the weekend to come up with a graceful reason to exit.</p>
<p>What happens with the rest of Lane&#8217;s time on Earth is particularly tough to watch. For a moment we see him in an almost let&#8217;s throw caution to the wind mode as he lets out some fresh comments to Joan in a last ditch effort to titillate her. This obviously doesn&#8217;t work so he goes home drunk only to have his wife beg him to go out for dinner. He reluctantly agrees and we think for a moment that maybe he&#8217;ll get through this, but then we learn that his wife has bought him a Jaguar. More debt. More shame. And his only natural response is to vomit.</p>
<p>It is only later when we see him trying to kill himself in that Jaguar that we realize how truly serious this all is. The car ends up living up to its awful reputation when it doesn&#8217;t start thus forcing Lane to suffer another humiliation by trying to fix the engine with his pair of now broken glasses. He never succeeds in making the engine start so once again we see him sneak into the dark offices of SCDP where he calmly types a suicide note and hangs himself on the other side of his office door.</p>
<p>Joan, the only person in the office who could probably claim to know Lane well, is the unfortunate person to discover that something is wrong and soon enough the body is discovered. Everyone is sent home except the partners who must inform Don and Roger after they return from a fiery pitch to a client (more on that later). Not intent to leave Lane&#8217;s body hanging, Don enlists Roger and Pete to help cut him down and lay him calmly on the sofa. It&#8217;s a heartbreaking act from Don who we can only imagine is being eaten alive with guilt in this moment.</p>
<p>Its hard to imagine what change this will have on the office. How will they cope psychologically? Who will run the financial aspects of the business? Will Pete rise up and put his name in the lobby? The thought of that makes me gag a little but Sterling Cooper Draper Campbell seems almost inevitable now.</p>
<p>As momentous as the death of Lane is, there were actually other things that happened this week. For one, Don continued his newly rediscovered urge to get new business. When Pete brings on Dunlop Tires Don decides that they need to move past &#8220;this piddly shit.&#8221; No longer is Don content with mediocre brands. He wants the big guys and he sets his sights first on Dow Chemicals, which is run by Ken Cosgrove&#8217;s father-in-law who has a less than favorable opinion of Don Draper following the infamous tobacco editorial.</p>
<p>Roger is able to get a meeting and Don basically storms in and rips into them that they shouldn&#8217;t be happy with anything less than 100% market share and he can deliver that. Its a fantastic little speech and I&#8217;ll be shocked if it doesn&#8217;t earn them the business, but what that means for Ken who has always been opposed to the conflict of interest should be interesting. He&#8217;s already demanding that Pete not be involved in any capacity, but we all know Pete&#8230;so clearly a conflict is nigh.</p>
<p>On a somewhat lighter note we also got to witness Sally Draper&#8217;s first date with none other than Creepy Glen (played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2804947/">Martin Holden Weiner</a> who also has one of the most unfortunate names of all time) who trains all the way into the city from school. The two of them go to the museum together and share some wonderfully awkward dialogue but then it happens&#8230;</p>
<p>No, they don&#8217;t have sex. Sally Draper&#8230;&#8221;becomes a woman.&#8221; And they show it, which may or may not be the most uncomfortable thing they&#8217;ve shown on this series since the episode when Sally paddled the pink canoe at a friend&#8217;s sleepover. And people wonder why Sally makes me nervous every time she is on screen. Yikes.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/episode-12-don2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-79112" title="episode-12-don2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/episode-12-don2-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>Not knowing what to do Sally bails on Glen and takes a cab all the way back to the suburbs where she is comforted by Betty who actually appears motherly for the first time in&#8230;well&#8230;ever. But then we realize that Betty is just pleased that Sally came back to her instead of Teeth who she had been staying with. Oh Betty, you eternal child, we love you!</p>
<p>A slightly downtrodden Glen makes his way back to Don and Teeth&#8217;s home where he left his backpack where he encounters Don who is just returning home after finding Lane. In an odd twist Don offers to drive Glen to the train station but as they ride down in the elevator Glen shocks Don by asking &#8220;Why does everything turn out crappy?&#8221;</p>
<p>This seems to strike a chord with Don (especially in someone so young) and so he asks Glen what he would do if he could do anything. And what we see next is Don in the passenger seat allowing Glen to drive the car. No words are spoken but Don is clearly embracing the simple pleasures that can make a life full of disappointment and tragedy worth living. Driving this car for one night won&#8217;t change Glen&#8217;s life or guarantee everlasting happiness but in that moment Don gave Glen something to live for no matter how fleeting it might be. And after losing a friend and business partner who could have used a similar touch along the way, this moment is beautiful.</p>
<p>Next week&#8217;s episode brings this stunning fifth season to a close and I won&#8217;t even dare attempt to guess what will happen but I&#8217;m prepared for anything.</p>

<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Girls-S1E8_1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-79095" title="Girls S1E8_1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Girls-S1E8_1.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="203" /></a>I’d call this week’s episode of <em><a href="http://www.hbo.com/girls/"><em>Girls</em></a></em><em> </em>a big twist.  What’s the twist, you ask? Mostly, the fact that Adam is not, in fact, a complete jerk. He’s weird, he’s awkward, but he’s . . . kind of adorable.</p>
<p>After last week’s intense moment between Hannah and Adam, <em>Girls</em><em> </em>picks back up with the couple experiencing life as a <em>couple</em>.  For once, Adam is in Hannah’s house, and on top of all the sex (that’s pretty normal for these two) they are also bonding. They look at old photos, they go running together, and they’re kind of adorable. It’s so not what you’d expect from Hannah and Adam, but it was a nice twist.  Adam even asks Hannah to come see Tech for his play, which he wrote and is starring in.</p>
<p>At the staging, however, Adam has a confrontation with a co-star, and he quits the play.  Then, when a cab nearly hits them, Adam has a spout of anger and screams at the cabdriver in a very aggressive way that clearly makes Hannah uneasy.  Tension rises between the two (especially after Adam jokingly pees on her in the shower and she is very much not amused) until Hannah finally tells him how he upset her.  Adam is shockingly receptive, too.</p>
<p>Later, at night, he wakes her up and makes her come with him.  Adam has plastered “I’m sorry” flyers on the street where he screamed at the cabby. It’s super sweet, and it shows a real turn for their relationship.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Marnie is having an emotional crisis over Charlie and his new girlfriend.  After Jessa tells her she’s uptight, Marnie decides to try and loosen up. The two go out, where they meet a man who clearly likes them.  While Jessa is clearly uninterested, Marnie agrees to go back to his place, and Jessa doesn’t leave her.  While the guy attempts, and fails, to seduce them, Marnie does take a leap into being wild. She kisses Jessa.</p>
<p>And Jessa kisses her back.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Girls-S1E8_2.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-79096" title="Girls S1E8_2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Girls-S1E8_2.jpg" alt="" width="326" height="203" /></a>And it gets pretty heated.  But poor, poor guy can’t get in the idle. They keep swatting him away.  Finally he gets annoyed and yells at them, especially after they spill wine on his nice rug.  Then the girls leave his place, though it’s left ambiguous what they’re little make out will mean for their friendship later.</p>
<p>But there was a depressing lack of Shoshanna.  I have to say, this is my biggest frustration with the show.  It’s like the writers can’t decide whether or not Shoshanna is a main character or not. In some episodes, she’s very present with her own story arc. In others, she doesn’t even appear.  I’d like to see a nicer balance.  Personally, Shoshanna is my favorite character.  More of her is not a bad thing.</p>
<p>But aside from that, this episode was really strong.  Seeing the “boyfriend” side of Adam was refreshing and surprising. I never expected him to be so . . . nice?  Not just nice, but he seems to be really into Hannah, which is not something I think anyone expected.  It really added depth to his character, which I appreciated.  And the Marnie and Jessa storyline was entertaining, too.  So it was a strong episode; I just wanted more Shoshanna.</p>
<p>What did you think? Sound off in the comments!</p>
<p>Season 1, Episode 8: “Weirdos Need Girlfriends Too” (original air date June 3, 2012).</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This week’s season finale of Game of Thrones sees Sansa stripped of her position, Daenerys reunited with what she values most and Robb Stark forging a union that may cost him vital support in his war.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week’s season finale of <a title="Game of Thrones" href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0944947/" target="_blank"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> sees Sansa stripped of her position, Daenerys reunited with what she values most and Robb Stark forging a union that may cost him vital support in his war.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Joffrey.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-79091" title="Joffrey" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Joffrey-194x300.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="300" /></a>Tyrion wakes up in King’s Landing, finding himself bandaged and in a much smaller room than he’s accustomed to. Maester Pycelle is with him and explains that with his father Tywin’s arrival, he’s no longer Hand of the King, Bronn is no longer head of the guard, and his barbarian allies have been paid and left King’s Landing. He explains that Cersei ordered the guard that attacked him to do so, and all of this has been her doing, but Pycelle recognizes, as many do, that without Tyrion the city would have fallen. Pycelle brings in Shae, who isn’t disturbed by Tryion’s wounds or lack of position. Tyrion puts on a self-pity routine and she all but slaps him out of it, asking that they run away together, knowing if Cersei tried to kill him once, she’ll try to do it again.</p>
<p>In his throne room, King Joffrey receives his grandfather Tywin, commending him for winning the battle for the city. He also commends Lord Baelish for bringing in House Tyrell as an ally, gifting him the castle at Harrenhal. King Joffrey asks Loras what he should want in repayment for his alliance and he asks only that their houses be united through Joffrey’s marriage to his sister Margaery. Joffrey’s clearly enticed, but wants to keep his vow to marry Sansa, who watches from afar.</p>
<p>Cersei speaks on behalf of the council and, in somewhat a surprise to many, says that their advice is he break off his promise to Sansa. After all, she’s the daughter of a traitor and her brother is waging an open war against the King. Pycelle backs up Cersei’s idea and so Joffrey agrees. Sansa is approached by Baelish, who warns her this isn’t as simple an end to their engagement as it seems, but that out of debt to her mother, he will get her back to her family. Elsewhere, Varys pays a quick visit to Ros, proposing a partnership against Baelish.</p>
<p>On the river, making their way to King’s Landing, Jaime Lannister warns Brienne they shouldn’t be taking this route. They find several women strung up and Brienne stops, wanting to bury them. Three Stark men come down the road and question the two of them, who do their best to conceal Jaime’s identity as the Kingslayer, but one swears he recognizes him. When they know they’ll fail the test to prove it, Brienne slaughters the men. Jaime reminds her they were Stark men and Brienne reminds him she works for Catelyn, not the Starks.</p>
<p>At Stannis’ camp, the would-be king is a little upset the siege of Blackwater didn’t go as planned. He questions Melisandre about all of her visions and what use it is to throw faith behind this god that doesn’t pay off the promises of her visions. He starts to strangle her, but stops himself when she doesn’t resist. She tells him the war will go on for years and that she still sees him atop the throne. They gaze into the fire together as she repeatedly asks him if he sees it too.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wall.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-79088" title="Wall" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Wall-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>In Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy is not having a good time. He has 20 not-so great soldiers while 500 Stark bannermen surround the castle, constantly blowing a horn to remind him of their presence. Maester Luwin suggests he run, that there’s no chance for victory, and maybe he can make it to the Wall and join the Night’s Watch, which at this point is his only chance for survival. Instead, Theon decides to rouse his troops with a speech about how great stories of this day will be told, children named after them, etc., when he’s knocked out from behind and the men throw a hood over his head, intending to make good on Robb Stark’s offer that all who surrender can return to the Iron Islands, except Theon. Luwin sees this and attempts to release Theon and is stabbed for his good deed.</p>
<p>Later, Osha brings Bran and Rickon out of hiding, finding the square smoldering a bit. They find their direwolves and see Luwin. Luwin asks Osha to protect them, even from her own kind, which she says she has no love for. Luwin tells her to get the boys to Jon Snow and he’ll protect them and send word to their mother. Meanwhile, Robb Stark tells his mother he doesn’t plan to honor the arrangement his father set up for his marriage, and instead weds Talisa in a private ceremony.</p>
<p>On the road outside of Harrenhal, leading to where, we just don’t know, Arya and her friends come across Jaqen. She wants Jaqen to teach her his skills and how he kills, which he offers to do if she’ll come with him. But, she wants to find her family. So, he gives her a coin he says is of great value, and tells her should she have need of him again, to find any man of Braavos, give him the coin, and recite a phrase he makes her repeat. They part ways as he tells her Jaqen is dead, off to start a new life.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Dany1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-79090" title="Dany1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Dany1-200x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>In Qarth, Dany enters the House of the Undying, leaving Jorah and a Dothraki outside the cryptic temple. She wanders through some rooms until she comes across a tent in a blizzard, where Drogo waits with their child, telling her maybe he shrugged off the afterlife to wait for her. She pulls herself away from the illusion and finds her three dragons chained on a pillar, where the warlocks meet her. The warlock explains their magic only returned when she gave birth to the dragons, which are stronger when near her, and by proxy increases their own magical strength. So, they chain her up, intending to keep her sealed with them for all time. Dany utters one word, “drakaris,” and the little dragons start to puff out some smoke before unleashing their fire on the warlock, their chains and the ones that hold Dany. Free, she emerges from the temple with her children.</p>
<p>Dany and her loyal steal the medallion key from Xaro while he sleeps, finding him with one of her handmaidens who betrayed them. They take the two with them and open his vault of unknown riches which is…empty. Dany thanks Xaro for this lesson and locks the two inside, ignoring their pleas and that they could still be of help to her. Dany and Jorah order the Dothraki to ransack Xaro’s possessions, intending to sell all of the gold and jewels and purchase a ship.</p>
<p>Beyond the Wall, things are looking a little rough for Jon Snow who, along with one of his Night’s Watch brothers, Quorin, are being taken to see the King Beyond the Wall. Quorin attacks Jon, accusing him of no longer being loyal, and the two are allowed to fight it out. Ultimately, Quorin lets Jon kill him, knowing it will give him a better position to infiltrate the wildlings. They cut Jon’s bindings and Ygritte takes him down to the wildling village.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Sam and two other brothers continue to dig when they hear a horn call. Two of them run, but Sam falls and is left behind as a snow storm approaches and with it, our first glimpse at an army. It’s the White Walkers, the dead zombies from Beyond the Wall, mounted on zombie horses, who appear to ignore Sam as they continue their march forward.</p>
<p>Season 2, Episode 10: “Valar Morghulis” (originally aired June 3, 2012)</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">You are one of the last few survivors in the fallen city of London in Ubisoft&#8217;s <em>ZombiU </em>for the Nintendo Wii U. Players must aim to stay alive as long as they can while making their way around the plague-filled streets. One bite and you&#8217;ll join the undead ranks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Gamers will have to search for resources such as food, weapons, ammunition, and first aid. The Wii U Gamepad will act as a Bug-Out Bag (BOB), the &#8220;ultimate all-in-one survival kit for your tools, inventory, med kits, maps and more.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Upon dying in <em>ZombiU</em>, gamers will take on a role of a new survivor offering a unique death mechanic in Ubisoft&#8217;s zombie title. Being revived as a new character comes with a catch. You&#8217;ll be BOB-less and have to retrieve it from your previous survivor&#8217;s zombified corpse.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>ZombiU</em> will offer a fun, social feature by sending out an alert to online friends when you die. They will be able to join your game, loot your BOB for gear, and put you out of your misery.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Multiplayer will also be available in the form of Survivors vs. Zombies. One player will take on the role of the Zombie Master from a top-down view, spawning enemies and springing traps using the Wii U Gamepad. The survivors will play from a first person perspective as they fight to survive using the Classic Controller.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>ZombiU</em> is expected to launch as one of the Wii U launch titles.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeighPic2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-78925" title="LeighPic2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeighPic2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="378" /></a>Shadow and Bone</em> made me a little wary at first, mostly because I had seen so many reviews just raving about how wonderful it is – which can sometimes lead to disappointment – but also because I’ve never been a huge fantasy reader.</p>
<p>I love this book.</p>
<p>It’s going to be hard to tell you much about the plot without spoilers, so instead I’ll tell you this – the plot is solid, it will keep you turning pages and desperate to know what happens. There are two other components that will make you love this story though, and I can tell you about them without spoiling, so let’s do that.</p>
<p>The world Leigh Bardugo has built is as rich as it is unique. We’re tumbled headlong into a place filled with fear, oppression, hopelessness, danger, and the people with the power to either save the world or plunge it further into darkness. The order of the Grisha are fascinating, the explanations of their powers are flawless and deeply imagined, and the city they inhabit leaps off the page until it feels more real than the world we live in. When I reluctantly turned the final page, coming back to reality required major effort.</p>
<p>The main character, Alina, is everything YA readers hope for and more. She’s flawed, but she knows it. She’s strong, but she needs to be convinced of that fact. Alina knows right from wrong, but like every good teenager, sometimes choosing the right is hard, so we don’t. Her problems are complicated, of course, by the fact that in Leigh’s world it’s not always easy to tell who&#8217;s good and who’s only pretending. Which brings me to The Darkling, the book&#8217;s villain…or is he?</p>
<p>I refuse to say more about him, but know this: well-written, sympathetic, misunderstood bad guys take good stories and make them great, and that’s what The Darkling does for <em>Shadow and Bone</em>. He’s fantastic. The kind of guy that makes you, as a reader, have to fight against your instinct to root for him – so just imagine how hard a task Alina has in figuring out whether or not he’s bad or good…or better yet, somewhere in between.</p>
<p>I don’t have a single criticism of this read, except perhaps that I have a long wait ahead of me before I can jump back into this place I came to love, for all of its treacherous faults.</p>
<p>Leigh was kind enough to take some time out of her ridiculously busy schedule to let me ask her five of my eleven gabillion questions about her book. I think you’ll find her answers give you even more reasons to run out and pick this one up today.</p>
<p><strong>Fantasy is a genre that could intimidate some people, mostly because you (as the author) are tasked with creating every aspect of your own personal world. Was there a particular inspiration behind the creation of Ravka? Who are the fantasy authors that inspired you or that you look up to?</strong></p>
<p>The world of <em>Shadow and Bone</em> was inspired by Tsarist Russia of the early 1800s. I knew I wanted to take readers someplace a little different and it just made sense in terms of the power dynamics that were already emerging in the narrative— the failure to industrialize, the deep divide between the aristocracy and the peasant class, the frustrations of an ill-equipped serf army. People also have these very romantic ideas aboutRussia— both its beauty and its brutality— that lend themselves to fantasy.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always so hard to narrow down my list of inspirations, but I&#8217;m a huge admirer of George R.R. Martin. He has this unique way of letting the geographical features of a particular place dictate every aspect of the world&#8211; religion, food, culture, clothing, speech. I got hooked on <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> a few years ago and I haven&#8217;t fallen so deeply into a world since I was a kid reading <em>Dune</em> for the first time. I didn&#8217;t even think I was still capable of it. I&#8217;m also a huge fan of Diana Wynne Jones. Her whimsy is always grounded in very real truths. She never skews twee. And I was blown away by the deftness of the world building in Holly Black&#8217;s <em>Curse Workers</em> series.</p>
<p><strong>Although there are two boys in <em>Shadow and Bone</em>, there isn&#8217;t anything cliched about the love triangle you&#8217;ve crafted. What specific challenges/realizations do each boy present for Alina?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you! When I wrote <em>Shadow and Bone</em>, I hadn&#8217;t read enough YA to realize love triangles were such a staple, so I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t muck it up too badly. Alina&#8217;s childhood friend, Mal, is the only person who truly knows her and understands what it means to have been raised at Keramzin, the orphanage where they grew up. But he&#8217;s also part of a past that both of them need to move beyond. The Darkling is a part of Alina&#8217;s future. He sees potential in her that no one else ever has and that&#8217;s a heady thing. Over the course of the story, Alina really has to ask herself how much she&#8217;s willing to sacrifice for the sake of belonging and feeling loved. Both boys play a role in that.<a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeighPic1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-78926" title="LeighPic1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LeighPic1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="299" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Alina is one of my favorite YA heroines in recent memory &#8211; maybe ever. She&#8217;s very real in her insecurities and faults as well as in her triumphs.Even though she&#8217;s got these amazing abilities, her biggest obstacle is believing in herself. Do you see Alina&#8217;s character as one of the more relatable things about Ravka?</strong></p>
<p>What a beautiful compliment. I&#8217;m so glad you liked her. I don&#8217;t know if I succeeded, but my goal with <em>Shadow and Bone </em>was for it to be satisfying for high fantasy fans, and accessible for people who may have previously avoided the genre. That&#8217;s part of the reason I chose to tell the story in first person, from Alina&#8217;s POV. I hope that her pragmatism and her humor will be a comfortable way for people to enter Ravka.</p>
<p><strong>What parts of the fantasy world shaped her character, and how can they be compared with the events and challenges that shape teenagers in our world?</strong></p>
<p>Alina isn&#8217;t just an orphan, she&#8217;s a product of the endless wars raging on Ravka&#8217;s borders, a refugee with no family or home. She&#8217;s been raised out of the peasant class, but just barely. She&#8217;s been drafted into the army (as all lowborn Ravkans are at age 16) to serve as a cartographer, but she&#8217;s not very good at it. Plus, the one person she truly cares about is drifting further away every day. I think there&#8217;s a deep sense of displacement there that goes beyond feeling like an outsider and that a lot of people experience when they&#8217;re young, before they&#8217;ve found their tribe and their place in the world. I hope they&#8217;ll see that reflected in Alina&#8217;s situation.</p>
<p>Also, Ravka isn&#8217;t a place where an impoverished girl of little talent has much autonomy or choice. Alina spent most of her life behind the walls of the orphanage at Keramzin, knowing that she&#8217;d end up as little more than cannon fodder in the King&#8217;s Army. When I was young, I often felt I didn&#8217;t have much say in the decisions being made around me and I hated the feeling that people had already made up their minds about who I was and what I might be capable of. Even after Alina reveals her power, she has a long way to go before she can escape others&#8217; expectations and her own doubts about herself.</p>
<p><strong>The Darkling has inspired quite a bit of love among readers who&#8217;ve managed to snag an early copy of your novel. I don&#8217;t want to spoil anything, so let&#8217;s just say his morals and intentions lie largely in shadow throughout the story. Personally, he&#8217;s my favorite character, but I love the questionable guys that perhaps aren&#8217;t all bad, and am rooting for his redemption in future installments. Are you surprised that readers are enjoying him &#8211; or even falling for him &#8211; even though he&#8217;s painted in such moral ambiguity and technically not the &#8220;hero&#8221; of the book?</strong></p>
<p>Who says he&#8217;s not the hero? I think the Darkling might disagree. I&#8217;ve always been drawn to characters like him and I&#8217;m delighted that my readers seem to be, too. Though I should point out that not everyone is in your camp, Trisha. Plenty of people distrust the Darkling and are sure he&#8217;s beyond saving. Love him or hate him, it&#8217;s honestly just exciting that people care!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The summer season is known for big budget blockbusters, but that’s not the only way to get your entertainment fix. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NR-ThornBrooks.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-78943" title="NR ThornBrooks" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NR-ThornBrooks.jpg" alt="" width="211" height="225" /></a>The summer season is known for big budget blockbusters, but that’s not the only way to get your entertainment fix.  Many networks offer a reprieve from the re-runs with new summer episodes of our favorite shows.  Fortunately, USA Networks has renewed <em><a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/necessaryroughness/" target="_blank">Necessary Roughness </a></em>for a second season, which kicks off on June 6<sup>th</sup>.   Season 2 promises new and fresh storylines, while highlighting characters that were previously obscured.  Poptimal and others recently sat down with three members of the cast to discuss the upcoming season, as well as their characters’ motivation.</p>
<p>Although each cast member of <em>Necessary Roughness</em> is integral to its development, the show is most enhanced by its principal characters and the actors who portray them.  Golden Globe nominee<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861361/" target="_blank"> Callie Thorne</a> stars as Dr. Dani Santino, sports psychologist to the New York Hawks.  The team’s mercurial wide receiver Terrence “TK” King is her most challenging patient, and some of the tensest moments of season 1 transpired between Dr. Dani and TK during early therapy sessions.  These two characters are the linchpins of the show, which is why I enjoyed my recent opportunity to speak with Callie Thorne and Mehcad Brooks, respectively.</p>
<p>One of the first things that struck me about Dr. Dani was her immeasurable strength and resolve in the face of personal adversity.  When we are first introduced to her character, she is in the midst of a nasty divorce.  She is faced with single parenthood and a fledgling psychiatry practice.  After being in the right place at the right time, she gets the opportunity to work her magic for the Hawks – stepping in to save their star player when no one else could.  Although her patients and children are frustrating, Dr. Dani always manages a certain grace under pressure, where lesser women would have wilted.  We asked actress Callie Thorne where she drew inspiration for Dr. Dani’s incredible resilience.  “A lot of what I bring to the character myself is a lot of my own mother,” Thorne says.  “I grew up with a single mother and so there’s a lot of tone and behavior that I think in terms of my own mom as well as the woman that the show is based on.”</p>
<p>There are other maternal aspects that come to bear on Thorne as well.  When discussing the difficulties of filming the therapy scenes, she says that the most difficult part is holding back the urge to comfort.  “You see someone in pain, in emotional pain and your natural instinct is to feel for them and to give them a hug.”  Thorne gets advice from creative consultant and adviser Dr. Donna Dannenfelser, upon whom the character of Dani Santino is based.  She says one of the things she learned from Dr. Donna is to go to that neutral place during therapy scenes, much like Donna herself would do for an actual patient.  Thorne does a masterful job of reeling in the human reaction in favor of a detached professional veneer that keeps proper distance between doctor and patient, especially when they become volatile.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NR-Thorn.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-78945" title="NR Thorn" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NR-Thorn.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="225" /></a>As mentioned before, it is that volatility between doctor and patient that made for explosive scenes between Dr. Dani and TK last season.  We spoke with actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1419635/" target="_blank">Mehcad Brooks </a>about his character’s relationship with Dr. Dani and what we can look forward to this season.  The first thing I noticed after screening the season 2 premiere was that Brooks is noticeably bigger.  He explained that he was able to devote himself fully to exercise in preparation for the second season.  He was injured in a serious car accident last year and was unable to adequately get in shape for the first season.</p>
<p>In addition to making sure that he looks the part, Brooks wants to perfect his performance down to the last nuance.  He consults with professional athletes to make sure his body language is accurate.  When asked whether or not TK was inspired by a particular wide receiver Brooks revealed, “It’s actually based on Keyshawn Johnson, who I don’t know from a can of paint. So, I based it on other guys that I know in the league.”  Brooks also drew a bit from the personal experience he had with his own father, a wide receiver during the 70s and 80s.</p>
<p>I was impressed with the seriousness with which Brooks approaches his craft, stating that viewers can expect to witness some profound psychological issues with TK this season.  He will be dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and once again Brooks drew on personal experience for his character motivation.  He openly stated that he’s dealt with PTSD in his own life after the death of his brother and that he’s witnessed it with friends who have returned from Afghanistan.  He explained, “You know, you don’t have to go to war to have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. I lost my brother when I was 19 and he was 17. And, you know, you react in the way that you do. You just react in the way that you do. And, there’s no wrong answer for it, there’s no right answer for it, but there’s ways of healing holistically that I think that we can as a nation, that we can embrace our sons and daughters that way, and have them know that they’re welcome to come back…they just need love.”  I think this season will stretch TK even more, and we will continue to witness his complexity.  He is more than the brash, flamboyant pro athlete who thinks of himself first, and I think the PTSD storyline will add a new dimension to the character.</p>
<p>Another aspect of the show that may be fleshed out in season 2 is the dynamic between TK and Nico, played by actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0169753/" target="_blank">Scott Cohen</a>.  Nico is the mysterious head of security and all-around “fixer” for the Hawks.  He does the dirty work, but somehow manages to remain above the fray.  He is protective of the Hawks family, as it is more than just a team.  Mehcad Brooks hinted that Nico would become more of a father figure to TK.  “He does need a positive male figure in his life. And Nico is the only guy with the patience and probably the training to handle someone’s attitude as large as TK’s.”</p>
<p>It is that training for which Nico is probably best known and most feared.  Cohen explained his preparation for the role and also what he enjoys about the character.  “I talked to two Navy SEALS that I’m connected to. I talked to NFL security people who exist and are very present in players’ lives. What attracted me to him (Nico) in the beginning was how quietly energetic he was. I mean he was so quiet but so intense and that to me was always interesting, to play that which is so difficult to actually just shut up and trust that your power is in your silence or in your eyes or whatever it may be.”  Cohen also enjoys the freedom he has in shaping his character, saying that the writers are receptive to ideas that he has pitched.  He’d like to see more for his character in the future.  “I would love to see a little bit more of his background as time goes on. The whole idea of him having a daughter last season was very interesting to me…did he have a family? Did he not have a family?  That’s interesting to me.”</p>
<p>It was a refreshing and eye-opening experience to meet the cast of <em>Necessary Roughness </em>and discuss the upcoming season.  The degree to which Callie Thorne, Mehcad Brooks, and Scott Cohen prepare for their roles is impressive, from drawing on personal experience to consulting with professionals and specialists.  Their preparation is evident, and I’m equally excited about season 2.  This summer, don’t forget there’s good entertainment on the small screen too.</p>
<p>Make sure you check out the second season premiere of <em>Necessary Roughness</em> as it premieres this Wednesday at 10/9c.</p>
<p><em>Necessary Roughness</em> airs Wednesdays at 10/9c on USA Network.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">The <em>Gears of War: Judgment </em>gameplay trailer has hit the internet showing off bits of the campaign and the new OverRun mode.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As stated <a href="http://poptimal.com/?p=78949">earlier today</a>,  <em>Judgment </em>will place gamers in control as Lieutenant Damon Baird 14 years before the first <em>Gears of War </em>game. Rod Fergusson, Director of Development at Epic Games, promises a more open <em>Gears</em> compared to the past trilogy. &#8220;<em>Judgment</em> is kind of unique in the <em>Gears of War </em>franchise because it has a different style of gameplay. Its sort of not the scripted cinematic way that we played of <em>Gears 1, 2, </em>and <em>3. </em>It&#8217;s a lot more open.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>Judgment</em> will also bring a brand new class-based 5v5 multiplayer mode to the series. Quinn Delhoyo, Multiplayer Designer at Epic Games, describes it as an Offensive Locust vs a Defensive COG game mode. Players will be able to play as an Engineer, Scout, Soldier, or Medic on the COG side, while playing Locust allows gamers to choose from an arsenal of characters similar to <em>Gears of War 3</em>&#8216;s Beast mode. Each class will have specific moves and abilities available only to their class type.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Fergusson says the idea for OverRun came from fans of the series. &#8220;People kept asking, &#8216;Why can&#8217;t you play Horde versus Beast?&#8217; and we actually tried it, but certain things didn&#8217;t work quite as well in [<em>Gears</em>] 3. When we had the chance with a new product, <em>Gears of War: Judgment</em>, we said let&#8217;s revisit that and see what we have to do to make it work. And sure enough, the class-based system really solidified that design and made it work really well.&#8221;</p>

The <em>Uncharted </em> developers teased the post-apocalyptic world last year at E3 and delivered a year later at Sony&#8217;s E3 2012 Press Conference.

<p style="text-align: left;">One of the best surprises and possibly greatest showings of E3 2012 so far comes from Ubisoft with their groundbreaking new IP <em>Watch Dogs</em>.</p>
<blockquote><p>In Watch Dogs, players enter the dangerous world of Aiden Pearce, a new class of antihero whose ability to hack into any connected system could be his most powerful weapon.  Whether it’s triggering a 30-car pileup by manipulating traffic-lights to trap an enemy during a downtown shootout or tapping into the city’s omnipresent security cameras to access anyone’s personal information, Pearce is capable of coercing and controlling almost every element of the world around him.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you missed the Ubisoft Press Conference, then check out the video above for what makes <em>Watch Dogs</em> a heavy contender for Best of Show.</p>
<p><em>Watch Dogs</em> is planned to release on Xbox 360, PS3, and the PC.</p>

The only problem is &#8211; that time was a couple decades ago. Now I don&#8217;t want to be a scrooge and knock a kids movie simply because I am at an age where I physically could have grandchildren (if I lived in that town from <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CGEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt1399683%2F&amp;ei=E5TKT97dA-jD2QW6lr3aCw&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-mvB0-Xy0Zx1Ev-3VIF74CuvYDg&amp;sig2=00j69rFqfeZVaXNXCSNHzg"><em>Winter&#8217;s Bone</em></a>) but since I think its reasonably safe to say that most of my reading audience is out of grade school, I should base my thoughts on how I think <em>they </em>(you?) would like it.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, if you are able to read these words right now because you&#8217;ve learned to read, you&#8217;re probably too old for <em>Madagascar 3.</em></p>
<p><em></em>But there is no shame in you being curious about it though! If the last decade or so has taught us anything, its that computer animated films are more often than not geared towards older audiences. From the emotional resonance of just about any Pixar film to the adult humor-laced <em>Shrek </em>films, the genre has become a completely legit form of mature cinematic entertainment. The kids are kept happy with the bright colors and big characterizations while adults are turned into sobbing wrecks at the simple beauty that can be conveyed from the relatively simplistic storytelling &#8211; its a perfect pedigree!</p>
<p>I have to admit that I have not seen the first two <em>Madagascar </em>films and therefore can&#8217;t speak to how they played to adults, but this one clearly leaves us in the dust. Sure, we are thrown an occasional bone of a joke that only we can get but by and large this is only playing to the nose-picking set and that 90-minute running time sure starts to feel long at times as a result.</p>
<p>The story picks up in Africa where Alex the lion (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001774/">Ben Stiller</a>), Marty the zebra (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001674/">Chris Rock</a>), Melman the giraffe (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001710/">David Schwimmer</a>), and Gloria the hippo (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000586/">Jada Pinkett Smith</a>) are lamenting their lot in life and desiring a return to New York City where they grew up in the Central Park Zoo. To accomplish this they swim (?!?!?) to Monte Carlo where their penguin and monkey frienemies are living it up at the casino after flying there in their special plane.</p>
<p>The hijinx in Monte Carlo get the attention of Captain Chantel DuBois (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000531/">Frances McDormand</a>), a notorious animal control officer who makes it her ultimate goal to put Alex&#8217;s head on her wall as a trophy. DuBois proves herself to be as powerful as a T-9000 Terminator and the gang barely escapes Monaco with their skin still attached to their bodies.</p>
<p>The escape is short-lived when their plane crashes in France and they find themselves forced to purchase a run down circus train to escape. It is on this circus train where we meet Vitaly the tiger (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0186505/">Bryan Cranston</a>), Stefano the sea lion (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001737/">Martin Short</a>), and Gio the leopard (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1567113/">Jessica Chastain</a>) who think these American animals can teach them everything they need to know about the circus. They are, of course, wrong but as the circus tours Rome and London they learn the power of teamwork and creativity and end up putting on a spectacular show to the tune of Katy Perry&#8217;s &#8220;Firework&#8221; which is actually a stunning highlight of the film.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MV5BMTUxMTIxMTQ1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM0Mzc4Nw@@._V1.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78965" title="MV5BMTUxMTIxMTQ1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM0Mzc4Nw@@._V1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MV5BMTUxMTIxMTQ1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTM0Mzc4Nw@@._V1-300x164.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="164" /></a>This performance earns them a contract to tour the United States and allows the American animals to ditch their new circus friends and return to their caged lives at the zoo, because apparently the grass is always greener? It seems like a no-brainer to me but this becomes the big emotional decision of the film as DuBois continues to pursue them in hopes of claiming her trophy once and for all.</p>
<p>The filmmakers have crammed a lot of stuff into the brief running time which should keep today&#8217;s ADD children more than entertained but as I mentioned already there is very little for older audiences to enjoy. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0056187/">Sacha Baron Cohen</a>&#8216;s lemur character has a bizarre relationship with a grizzly bear that I found amusing and the character of <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sa=X&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;biw=1263&amp;bih=624&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=imvns&amp;tbnid=HHS6Vxsrktgu0M:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.fanpop.com/spots/mort-the-lemur/images/6914452/title/mort&amp;docid=VNZaSI9J0k9SmM&amp;imgurl=http://images2.fanpop.com/images/photos/6900000/Mort-mort-the-lemur-6914452-489-500.jpg&amp;w=489&amp;h=500&amp;ei=oJjKT9D0KejC2wX8_azaCw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=104&amp;vpy=164&amp;dur=792&amp;hovh=227&amp;hovw=222&amp;tx=129&amp;ty=139&amp;sig=107923171567869309677&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=124&amp;tbnw=110&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=20&amp;ved=1t:429,r:0,s:0,i:140">Mort</a> is cute enough to sustain half of the movie himself, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Animation-wise, the film looks great and the now requisite 3D for these kind of films works well enough to emphasize the amount of destruction going on with debris flying at your face constantly. Is it absolutely necessary for the viewing experience? Probably not. But the kids will eat it up so why not indulge them a little more.</p>
<p>In many ways the movie plays like an old school Looney Tunes short with DuBois endlessly pursuing her prey despite constant physical injuries that would put down a normal human being for good. This is strung along with the drama of getting the circus together and though I expected the supporting characters to have their own little storylines too, Marty, Melman, and Gloria are given almost nothing to do. If you&#8217;re a fan of any of them go prepared for disappointment.</p>
<p>Above all though kids will love this. Its got that brand of simple/cheap one-liners that they love mixed with a ton of slapstick humor and strange 90s pop songs that I guess kids find funny nowadays? Go figure. Childless adults should steer clear but if you do you have kids and they&#8217;re begging you to go see it&#8230;I think its probably your spouse&#8217;s turn to take the kids to the movie if you catch my drift&#8230; I won&#8217;t tell if you won&#8217;t.</p>

<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Gears-Feature.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-78950" title="Gears Feature" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Gears-Feature.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="333" /></a></p>
<p>New details are trickling out for <em>Gear of War: Judgment</em> after developers Epic Games and People Can Fly revealed the game at Microsoft&#8217;s E3 Press Conference earlier this morning.</p>
<p>Centering around the Kilo Squad, the campaign for <em>Judgement</em> will be set years before the events of the <em>Gears</em> trilogy. Fans will follow Kilo Squad, consisting of Damon Baird, Augustus &#8220;The Cole Train&#8221; Cole, and new comers Sofia Hendricks and Garron Paduk, as they attempt to save the besieged city of Halvo Bay from a new enemy.</p>
<p>Co-op fans can breath a sigh of relief as gamers will be able to tackle the campaign cooperatively with up to three friends over Xbox Live. That&#8217;s right, four-player co-op is back.</p>
<p><em>Judgement</em> will also come with a new system titled &#8220;Mission Declassification&#8221; which will allow players to experience &#8220;more challenging gameplay scenarios and achievements by uncovering critical information during the course of the campaign.&#8221; Perhaps those collectibles will finally have a purpose this time around.</p>
<p>Also being introduced in the latest iteration in the <em>Gears</em> series will be &#8220;Smart Spawn System [S3]&#8221; for both campaign and multiplayer. S3 promises  to ensure &#8220;that each encounter is unique and new because types, timing and locations of enemies change with each new encounter.&#8221;<strong><br />
</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Fans of Beast and Horde will find another gameplay mode awaiting them in OverRun, &#8220;a thrilling new class-based competitive mode that pits Locust and COG soldiers in a head-to-head battle unlike anything <em>Gears </em>fans have experienced yet.&#8221; The class-based mode will consist of a five player teams that alternate between Locust and COG soldiers. Players will be able to play as Medics, Soldiers, and other war based classes in OverRun.<strong><br />
</strong><strong><br />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78904" title="Necessary Roughness" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NUP_148283_1553-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" />Sometimes it takes two or three or maybe even six seasons before a TV relationship becomes “official.” Just take a look at Booth/Bones, House/Cuddy and Castle/Beckett. But for fans of USA Network’s <em>Necessary Roughness</em>, the payoff came rather quickly during last summer’s season one finale.</p>
<p>After evading one another because of their status as co-workers, Dr. Dani Santino (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861361/" target="_blank">Callie Thorne</a>) and Matt Donnally, trainer for the (fictional) New York Hawks, decided to give their relationship a real shot. Now that Matt plays a larger role in Dr. Dani’s life, it’s given actor <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0089456/" target="_blank">Marc Blucas</a> the chance to explore his character more.</p>
<p>“Matt last year was just the boyfriend,” he explained during a conference call with reporters. “We really had to spend the season learning about Dr. Dani and [football player] T.K. and the world we were establishing, what the show’s about.”</p>
<p>Though audiences are privy to Dr. Dani and Matt’s relationship status, the couple are keeping it secret from their co-workers (except the all-knowing Nico) and, most importantly, family. In the season premiere, we see Dr. Dani tell Matt that she doesn’t want to introduce him to her two children (teens Lindsay and Ray) until she’s sure that he’ll be a “permanent fixture” in their life.</p>
<p>“It creates a lot of tension,” said Blucas about their secret relationship. “There comes a point [for Matt] where it’s just like, ‘okay, the secret thing…is fun, you deal with it,’ [but] at the end of the day, if this relationship’s going to kick into the next level, who cares about the rest of the stuff?”</p>
<p>Dr. Dani and Matt’s personal life will play a large role in season two, and Blucas even revealed that not each episode would introduce a patient of the week. Some episodes will focus solely on the main characters and their issues, including the Pittman divorce storyline that leaves the fate of the Hawks team up in the air. As Blucas points out, the writers of <em>Necessary Roughness</em> have found inspiration from real life events in the pro-sports world.</p>
<p>“They’ve pulled from what really happens in sports to help bring that Marshall Pittman character to life and really throw a monkey wrench into the rest of our lives,” said Blucas. “[There’s a] ripple effect when your boss and company starts to be a little unstable.”</p>
<p>Matt and Nico (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0169753/" target="_blank">Scott Cohen</a>), the Hawks’ head of security, were arguably two fan favorite characters from last season (I mean, have you <em>seen </em>them?). This summer, Blucas said, “we’re getting an opportunity to not only further their storylines, but to learn more about [them] and look at more from their point of view.”</p>
<p>Particularly for the ambitious Matt Donnally, the Hawks shake-up may provide him with the opening he needs to become more than just the trainer. As Blucas joked: “I’m the trainer, I’m everybody’s bitch.” But that looks to change throughout the season and Blucas hints to a “complete shift of power.”</p>
<p><em>Necessary Roughness</em> seems to be stretching itself even more for its sophomore season, and viewers will have the opportunity to find out what’s next for this group of diverse characters when the show returns to <strong>USA Network on Wednesday, June 6 at 10/9c</strong>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SWATHPic1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-78898" title="SWATHPic1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SWATHPic1.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="376" /></a>Do you ever go out to dinner at a super nice (read: expensive) restaurant, and everything is gorgeous. The décor, the service, the menus, your clothes…but the actual food doesn’t live up to the atmosphere?</p>
<p>That’s how I feel about <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1735898/">Snow White and the Huntsman</a></em>. It’s a stunning package, with slick, shiny paper and pretty bows, but what’s inside left me bored and super, super disappointed.</p>
<p>This was the 2012 summer movie I looked forward to the most. It was my <em>Prometheus</em>, my <em>Dark Knight Rises</em>. So no one is more disappointed than I to tell you that it’s just not that good. The problem with reviewing it is, at least for me, that it’s also not that bad.</p>
<p>The evil queen Ravenna (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000234/">Charlize Theron</a>) tricks her way into the heartbroken, widower king’s (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0403168/">Noah Huntley</a>) bed, only to murder him and steal the kingdom on their wedding night. The queen obviously has some issues with men, accusing them of using women until they grow ugly and old only to cast them aside. We get more of her backstory as the movie progresses, but none of it makes me care about her, so it’s basically a colossal waste of screen time. She and her brother Finn (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0819874/">Sam Spruell</a>) toss Snow White (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829576/">Kristen Stewart</a>) into a barren cell in the tower and rule with an iron first. Under their hands, the kingdom falls into poverty and ruin, even the plants refusing to bloom in her dark presence. Lovely girls disappear and become food for the queen as she steals their beauty and years of life for her own.</p>
<p>When the magic mirror, which actually looks more like a giant cymbal, tells Ravenna that Snow White is destined to surpass her in beauty and holds the potential to take back the kingdom and destroy her, the queen sends her creeper brother to fetch the girl. Snow White endures his inappropriate suggestions for a few minutes until escaping into the dark forest. Like in the Grimm tale, the queen summons the Huntsman (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1165110/">Chris Hemsworth</a>), a drunken widower who knows the dark forest, to bring Snow White back. In exchange, she promises to return the man’s wife from the dead (which does not happen in the fairy tale).  When he finds Snow White, her purity and beauty distract him, and when he realizes Finn and Ravenna have no intention of keeping their promise about his wife, he helps Snow escape – still not knowing who she is or what her life means to the people.</p>
<p>Supposedly, the entire kingdom will rally behind her, finally rising up to defeat the evil queen and return the rightful heir to the throne. Her childhood friend William (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3510471/">Sam Claflin</a> – if you’re like, where have I seen that guy before, it’s in the fourth <em>Pirates of the Caribbean </em>installment. He played the adorable priest who fell in love with the mermaid girl), has been pining for his lost Snow White all these years, and when he learns she’s alive, he races to her side.</p>
<p>Then the filmmakers fall into a rabbit hole adorned by their (admittedly stunning) special effects and we lose the plot of the movie for a good thirty to forty-five minutes. Snow, the Huntsman, William, and the Seven Dwarves wander through a pretty but completely unnecessary fairy forest, then trek across cliffs and snow covered hills, etc on their way to the Duke’s stronghold.</p>
<p>We briefly get back to the actual story, and the disguised queen tricks Snow White into biting a poisoned apple, she dies, a kiss brings her back to life. Instead of living happily-ever-after, she leads an army into battle.</p>
<p>Interspersed with all of the completely unnecessary but pretty scenes with Snow White and her loyal band of followers are completely unnecessary but pretty scenes with Ravenna. The scene in the previews, where she’s emerging naked from a pool of white…paint? Yeah. There is no point to that, it’s never explained why the queen enjoys bathing in white paint, it just…looks cool? And that’s only one example.<a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SWATHPic2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-78899" title="SWATHPic2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SWATHPic2.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="380" /></a></p>
<p>Every time the film cut from Snow White back to the castle, I groaned inside. This is boring, my brain shouted! Go back to Kristen Stewart!</p>
<p>Yes, people. My innards were so thoroughly bored with Charlize Theron’s evil queen (who wasn&#8217;t even as frightening as her brother) that I wanted nothing more than to return to Kristen Stewart’s storyline. Before the release, I overheard multiple strangers say some version of this: “That movie looks sooooo goooood, and it has Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron, but Kristen Stewart is going to ruin it.”</p>
<p>You know what? She doesn’t. At all.</p>
<p>There are still some (irritating, imo) mannerisms that Kristen Stewart should work on discarding if audiences are going to be able to forget she’s herself for an entire film, but those small things aside, I <em>bought</em> her as Snow White. She’s beautiful, and the fact that she has very little dialogue only increases my belief that she’s a far more competent actress than the <em>Twilight</em> scripts allow her to be. In <em>Snow White and the Huntsman</em>, she’s riveting. She’s the only part of the film that held my interest.</p>
<p>The love story, if you can call it that, is non-existent. Instead of spending time on character development, on letting us see how the queen has destroyed the land and the people, on showing me how the Huntsman falls in love with Snow White, they spend the majority of the film making it Wonderland magical (which makes sense, since the film shares a producer with Burton’s <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>). But unlike <em>Alice</em>, who’s purpose is to share a tale set in a magical, dreamlike place, we’re trying to follow a story in <em>Snow White</em> that makes sense, that has a plot and characters we’re meant to care about, and the over the top aesthetic only detracts from our ability to connect with the film. In addition to the visual sidebars, I found the score to be incredibly obnoxious, obvious, and distracting as well.</p>
<p>By the time we ride into battle with Snow and her army, I’m not nervous. I’m not filled with anticipation. What I am filled with is pee, am bored to tears, and shifting in my chair and thinking…can this be over now, please?</p>
<p>Which, call me crazy, is not the effect I’d be going for during the climax of a movie.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t have a problem with the changes they made to the original story. I love the idea of a warrior Snow White, a character who encompasses the idea that a woman can be both gentle and ferocious, beautiful and determined, kind and protective. But aside from that alteration, the rest of the &#8220;twists&#8221; were less imaginative than we saw from the writer&#8217;s on <em>Once Upon a Time</em> last year.</p>
<p>The evil queen character plays too big of a role for someone who influences the story but isn’t directly involved except at the outset and the conclusion. The movie is <em>at least</em> 30 minutes too long, the filmmakers wasted an interesting premise and a decent cast with their refusal to shake loose from their fascination with the ability to create special effects.</p>
<p>I’d wait for video, and even then, make sure you have something to read when you get bored. You will.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dance2.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78858" title="dance2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dance2-300x156.png" alt="" width="300" height="156" /></a>Auditions continued right on to Los Angeles this week with two dance-filled hours full of the usual nutty entertainers but also genuinely talented individuals. There was no Tyce Diorio or Lil’ C. to complete the panel this week and only <em>Modern Family’s</em> Jesse Ferguson could properly take the place as guest judge this time around. The trio had their hands full with a ton of hopeful auditioners each struggling to gain their approval for the next round of choreography or, even better, that big ticket to Vegas. As I said, it was a two-hour show, a <em>looong</em> two-hour show, with so many amazing people that it would be hard to highlight each and every one of them, so let’s just talk about the more outstanding moments and dancers of this week.</p>
<p>I suppose the best way to start the list off is with Jontel “Johnny Waacks” Gibson whose seventies funk era dance style of “waacking” had the judges uncontrollably giggling like school children over a few strategically placed innuendos. “How long have you been waacking?” and “Can we see?” was only met with obvious laughter from the whole room and Johnny’s explanation of “I started training by myself” didn’t help his case either. When he walked up on stage with that name, he had to know it was coming. It was a little inappropriate and immature on the judges’ part, but, I thought it was funny, too. Then again, I’m a little inappropriate and immature. But it was all a big joke until he actually started his routine which was ridiculously fluidic and smooth. He was a true professional who obviously takes his craft quite seriously. All the waacking caused the judges to quickly sober up and they decided to send Johnny through to choreography.</p>
<p>Although a little early, this list would not be complete without the fabulous Ninja Twins duo. Brothers Nick and James Aragon brought eccentricity to a new level. The two prattled on endlessly about one another with such excessive comedic banter that it always sounded like they were a line away from a honey badger joke. They belong on the stage in The Comedy Store rather than on <em>SYTYCD</em> and by the end of their routine, they may be considering that route. The judges absolutely loved them and even gave them a standing ovation. However, before the start of their routine, Nigel inquired about their age which the thirty-two year olds had no problem confessing. Thirty-two? Great, let’s see you dance! Ok, that was wonderful but, as you know, thirty-two is over the age limit for the show so sorry, boys, you’re out of luck! I guess their performance was strictly to amuse them. Could you imagine if Von “I Hate Fun and I Take Myself a Little Too Seriously” Kipper from last week was there? How angry would he become and how hilarious would it be? They might need to bring that guy back, for <em>my</em> amusement.</p>
<p>There were quite a few fantastic ladies that made it through to choreography and to Vegas but it seemed like the boys were making the most impact. In fact, Cole Horibe made the biggest impression on me and, dare I say, could be my favorite thus far. His incorporation of dance into martial arts was mesmerizing and aesthetically perfect. His ability to combine the two arts was impressive and I have yet to see someone show such control and fine tuning. He was quick like lightning and precise as all hell and thank God the judges recognized that by giving him a ticket straight to Vegas.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dance1.png"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-78857" title="dance1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/dance1.png" alt="" width="233" height="273" /></a>Often these competitions turn into three-ring circuses and performer David Matz tried to do his part by literally bringing one of the rings. David is a circus performer along with a crew of other entertainers but they’re in no way the creepy circus folk you might be thinking of. He works with all sorts of props and devices like silks and stilts but for the audition he brought along his “cyr wheel”, a large metal hoop that once lit on fire could successfully leave you feeling crispy with one false move. But for everyone’s safety, the ring of fire was not lit so it was just David and his hoop on the stage. The only thing that could be said about his performance was how incredible it was; the judges were thrilled. But, it’s not a cyr wheel competition so despite the good feedback, they sent him to choreography to see what else he could do, sans the wheel. Choreography is still a great thing but unfortunately, David ended up dropping out later when he had a hard time keeping up with the other dancers.</p>
<p>Like any good reality show, the only way to end the night is with a little tear-jerking drama. Jasmine Mason had watched her brother, Marshea, audition for the last three seasons until finally taking the leap to compete with him. The sibling bond can be a strong thing and theirs is no exception. Just six weeks prior to the show, the two were involved in a head-on car collision that left Jasmine unscathed and Marshea in a coma. But Marshea had beaten the odds, despite even being originally pronounced dead at the scene of the accident, and after the beating his body had taken, he somehow still had the gift of dance with no disabilities. It makes you wonder if dancing truly is his destiny and, if not, then he definitely has some angels looking over him. So, to go along with the touching story, it turns out the brother-sister team really dance beautifully and both were given the last Vegas tickets, ending the night on a positive note.</p>

<p>Craving a new puzzle game? Than look no farther than publisher Square Enix&#8217;s <em>Quantum Conundrum. </em>Developed by Airtight Games, <em>Quantum Conundrum</em> will throw players into a first-person environmental puzzle game from the mind of Kim Swift, co-creator of <em>Portal</em>.</p>
<p>The game&#8217;s trailer initially seems similar to puzzles one could expect from <em>Portal, </em>until it starts showing off how unique and manipulative the  environments can be.</p>
<p>Available for preorder in standard edition and season pass on Steam, <em>Quantum Conundrum </em> will be 10% cheaper during its preorder period. The season pass will include &#8220;three exclusive <em>Team Fortress 2</em> items, an exclusive downloadable <em>Quantum Conundrum </em>soundtrack and future downloadable puzzle packs. Fans who preorder the PC version of the game will be automatically entered into a sweepstakes to have their likeness painted by the<strong><em> </em></strong><em>Quantum Conundrum</em> art staff and hung in Professor Quadwrangle’s mansion.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>Quantum  Conundrum</em> will be available on Steam on June 21 while releasing later this summer on PSN and XBLA for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>

As Poptimal gears up for a busy week of all things gaming, we evaluate what the expo has to offer this year that has us salivating, seduced, and psyched for more.</p>

<p><strong><a href="assassinscreed.ubi.com/ac3/en-US/index.aspx">Assassin’s Creed III</a></strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft is not the only developer this year to add some extra juice to their old franchise in an effort to mix things up a bit. <em>Assassin’s Creed III</em> is the first AC game in three years to feature a new ancestor of Desmond Miles, moving on from the epic adventures of Ezio Auditore of Italy, to the mysterious Connor Kenway, a half-English, half-Mohawk man stuck in the middle of the American Revolution. While gameplay looks fundamentally the same, the world has been totally redesigned to capture the rich, combustible landscape of North America in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. Instead of tightly packed towers and buildings, Connor mantles up trees; the deadly wrist blades of old, now swapped for an even deadlier tomahawk. The setup is intriguing and although it’s hard to see how Connor can remain stealth covered in white robes while climbing through a green/brown landscape, his mixed race is sure to have his will and loyalty pulled by the Native Americans who call America their home, and the Colonists hell bent on smoking them out of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <iframe style="text-align: center;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/f6UL63Zo-uo" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong><a href="halo.xbox.com/en-us/games/halo4/Overview">Halo 4</a></strong></p>
<p>Master Chief’s newest adventure through galaxies unknown also marks his first jaunt outside the realm of <em>Halo’s</em> original dev team, Bungie. Picking up the reins is 343 Industries, formed as a first party developer by Microsoft to oversee the future of their most coveted franchise. As little is known of <em>Halo 4</em> as has been seen, though some leaked action figure card backs from McFarlane Toys suggest that Chief is once again going into the breach against Covenant forces. While this is all well and good, it truly feels like a missed opportunity, since Master Chief could have been woken up 500 years in the future to face a new threat. I mean, how many outings have to be Covenant-related before it all starts to bleed together into one giant narratively confusing mess. Oh, it already has? Fuck.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <iframe style="text-align: center;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/EfOOOAN9e9w" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.sega.com/alienscolonialmarines/"><strong>Aliens: Colonial Marines</strong></a></p>
<p>Sega’s last outing for their Aliens license, <em>Aliens VS Predator</em> was not the return to form that captured the incredibly visceral PC experience of days gone by, but it was a fair offering that proved faithful to both Aliens and Predator universes even if the design was less than inspired. Thankfully, fine folks over at Gearbox have been hard at work on their take on the Aliens universe for the past seven years and so far the tidbits shown have been pretty awesome. Last year, their E3 offering was merely a guided, hands-off demo through Hadley’s Hope which was cool, if not all that suspenseful. Despite all that, it was clear that they were absolutely nailing the look at feel of Cameron’s universe, and the recently released trailer showing a new squad of marines getting totally worked over after trying to assess what happened on the Sulaco after Ripley, Newt, Hicks, and Bishop were jettisoned from escape pods is a smart way to start what is sure to be another express elevator to hell. It’s high time we got another truly kick ass Aliens thrill-fest, so let’s hope that a playable demo is ripe for the picking next week.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: center;"> </span><iframe style="text-align: center;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nFBrgeSjj-0" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.tombraider.com/us/base/agegate?refer=19&amp;">Tomb Raider</a></strong></p>
<p>Crystal Dynamics surprised everyone last year when they revealed that not only were they working on a new <em>Tomb Raider</em> game that nobody really asked for, but one that was a reboot of the series in nearly every respect, from story, to visuals, to tone. Shockingly, the potential to their redesign is quite great. The impact of Nathan Drake on the adventure genre has not been lost on Lara Croft and company with last year’s demo showing her at the most <em>Indiana Jones</em> she has ever been, tumbling through caverns and near-death moments, bruised and bloodied through it all. With the game launching next year, a deeper demo will hopefully show both the depth and edge the game could only tantalize last year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4e3qaPg_keg" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong><a href="e3.nintendo.com">Wii U</a></strong></p>
<p>Nintendo’s announcement of Wii U last year was unexpected and, dare I say, unnecessary. Although Nintendo is an absolute behemoth in the hardware-moving market, in a world where more powerful consoles like the 360 and PS3 are setup to have a lifecycle of at least eight to ten years, it feels like Nintendo is stealing a move from the Apple playbook, doling out slightly new hotness every few years instead dramatically evolving it. That said, the Wii U controller (the entire selling point of the console) looks interesting and, under the tutelage of creative developers, has the potential to be a game changer…or it could just be another niche system that Nintendo is so famously known for (let’s face it, no one is playing <em>Call of Duty</em> on a Wii).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"> <iframe style="text-align: center;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/C6l-JJprV_E" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong><a href="us.playstation.com/psvita/">Vita: Phase Two</a></strong></p>
<p>The Vita is hands down the most technologically advanced handheld console on the market. That fact is undeniable. That Sony blitzed the system’s launch with a slew of games also shows that the company does not want their new device to whither on the vine, but things have been way too quiet in Vita-Land lately. New games have trickled out here and there over the past few months, but to little fanfare. The Vita’s software future looks bright with mega-titles like <em>God of War</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Bioshock</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, and <em>Little Big Planet</em> coming to the little spitfire, but if Sony neglects their new portable much like they did the PSP, there’s going to be a bit of total recall happening that doesn’t involve getting your ass to Mars. Hopefully at Sony’s press conference this year, they will bolster confidence and talk about the future of the Vita and how they plan to make it as important is the PlayStation 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/X85ycsb7Nhk" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.rockband.com/games/rockbandblitz">Rock Band Blitz</a></strong></p>
<p>The world’s obsession with rhythm games may have come and gone, but millions continue to play -most notably- Harmonix’s Rock Band franchise. The company has stated in the past that a large chunk of its revenue continues to come from weekly DLC releases to <em>Rock band 3</em> and local bars that host Rock Band karaoke nights are still thriving, this I can personally attest to. So it’s no surprise that work continues on pushing the Rock Band brand to places it has never been before, though in the case of <em>Rock Band Blitz</em>, it’s to a place we’ve already been. <em>Blitz</em> adopts the gameplay of previous Harmonix gems <em>Frequency</em> and <em>Amplitude</em>, swapping out the instrument peripherals for one standard game controller. <em>Blitz</em> can be played with all previously released <em>Rock Band</em> songs including all DLC and also comes pre-loaded with twenty-five new tracks that can be instantly played on <em>Rock Band 3</em>. <em>Rock Band Blitz</em> may seem like a far cry from the heyday of <em>Rock Band</em>, but it shows that Harmonix is still behind its crown jewel, just like many other fans around the world.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QkkoHAzjnUs" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/V/"><strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong></a></p>
<p>Rockstar’s announcement trailer was one of the big Holy-Shit moments of last year, which showed teasing shots of what one can only assume is a highly detailed revision of Los Santos. Like <em>Halo 4</em>, very little is known about the game which has left many to only speculate the depth and breadth of the game. Does it encompass the entirety of San Andreas? How will it tie into the other games, if at all? What do the <em>Max Payne 3</em> crews have to do with any of it? While Rockstar normally doesn’t normally make appearances at the convention, we can only keep our fingers crossed and hope something GTA related will be at the big show.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Dead-Space-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-78832" title="Dead-Space-3" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Dead-Space-3.jpg" alt="" width="488" height="320" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Dead Space 3</strong></p>
<p>It sucks being Issac Clarke. That much is unavoidable. It does not suck, however, to play Dead Space, which over the course of two games has proven itself to the single most terrifying video game experience ever (unless you&#8217;re counting Aquaman). Walking down a simple hallway has never been more hand-wringing and brow sweating as it is in Dead Space, so EA&#8217;s eleventh hour reveal of Dead Space 3 is a welcome one. Also welcome into the universe is new character John Carver, which seems to promise some manner of Co-Op in the new title. The late psudo-unveil of the game suggests that it might not be out in time for 2012, but hopefully this is the ace up EA&#8217;s sleeve for the holiday season.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Killin-72-3.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-78821" title="Killin 72-3" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Killin-72-3.jpg" alt="" width="291" height="225" /></a><a href="http://www.amctv.com/thekilling">The Killing</a></em> moves in yet another different direction this week, but one that doesn’t feel as random and is in fact, quite compelling. Following the events of last week, in which Linden (<a href="www.imdb.com/name/nm0257969/" target="_blank">Mireille Enos</a>) discovers a bloody city council ID badge on the mysterious tenth floor of the Indian Casino before getting knocked unconscious, the embittered ex-cop wakes up in a hospital. But this is not just any hospital. This is the kind of make-you-better place that has bars on the windows and criss-crossed wires through double paned glass. This is a psych ward. It feels like it could be a nightmare both figuratively and literally, but unfortunately for our intrepid detective, it is her reality as it appears that Chief Jackson (and perhaps other forces) have had her committed.</p>
<p>“Your friend is being taken care of,” a nurse explains to a raging Holder, “She’s a danger to herself and others.” Linden tries to contact Holder (<a href="www.imdb.com/name/nm1172478/">Joel Kinneman</a>) either by visiting hours, phone calls, or even written notes, but they won’t allow it. She’s on a seventy-two hour suicide watch and is being carefully monitored. No coincidence either, that in seventy-two hours, the mayoral election will be over, rendering the Larsen investigation moot.</p>
<p>It’s here where they start to pull people out of the woodwork that you would need a flowchart to remember who they were. People that go far back as the first few episodes of season one, which seems to have little impact on the closing hours of the show. Terri returns to Stan’s house at his request and he apologizes for the way he freaked out on her. “Stan, what happens if the cops never find the guy?” She asks him, suggesting that it’s time for Stan to let go, both of Rosie and of Mitch, and to start living again. Stan takes this opportunity to visit Rosie’s old teacher Bennet Ahmed and his wife Amber. You’ll need to remember that Stan thought Rosie and Bennet had a relationship and he beat the shit out of him in season one. Remember? Okay, great. Because it’s really not that important. Stan basically tries to mea culpa for what he did last season, which has only been about a week ago within the time table of the show. Bennet succinctly tells him to piss off and die and that’s the end of that.</p>
<p>On the side of the show that people actually care about, Holder goes to visit Reggie, to see if there’s any sort of angle he can work to get Linden out of the ward. “This is how it started last time,” Reggie warns of Linden’s previous stint in a psych ward after a murder investigation pushed her too hard. “This time it’s different,” Holder counters. After spying an ostentatious sign selling the revitalization project on the waterfront, Holder walks down to the pier, where the billboard for Adams’s campaign connects him with Michael Ames and his company, who is going to be doing the lion’s share of the revitalization work. He calls a friend at the department and asks him to dig up any dirt linking the Adams to Ames. Turns out that there’s an arrest on record from a few weeks ago in which someone tried to trespass onto the property. The charges were dropped, but the interesting thing about it is that the arrest occurred the night Rosie was murdered.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Killin-72.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-78822" title="Killin 72" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Killin-72.jpg" alt="" width="212" height="238" /></a>Back at the ward, Linden trudges through the familiar <em>Cuckoo’s Nest</em> dance steps, stuck in a holding pattern. She is taken in to a private office where she must talk to a psychiatrist who can clear her for exit of the facility. “The woman that found you on the tenth floor said you were going to jump, that you got into a scuffle,” she tells Linden. Of course, this couldn’t be further from the truth; it’s simply the lie that Chief Jackson had to tell to get Linden out of play. The psychiatrist reveals that the woods/lake drawing that had been mysteriously stuck to the fridge in Linden’s hotel room was actually with Linden the last time she was committed and holds a special meaning for her. That case involved a hooker who had been brutally killed in her apartment, where the body was decomposing for weeks before someone figured out that something was wrong. The hooker’s five year old son Adrien was stuck there for a week, hiding in a closet waiting for someone to come. When the police arrived, he just kept drawing the same picture over and over. Ultimately, the father was arrested, but Linden never really believed it. The shrink tries to make a connection between that child and Rosie, but Linden remains closed off.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Holder questions the beat cop that arrested the trespasser at the waterfront. His name is Joseph Nowak and apparently, “Whatever Nowak was doing there, it wasn’t construction.” He knows this because of who Nowak really works for: Janeck Kovarsky. Holder tracks down Nowak and after a short foot chase, shakes him down at gunpoint. It turns out that Nowak was paid to bury some Indian bones at the construction site, and his arrest prompted a meeting with Ames, Jackson, and Adams on the tenth floor of the casino. “All our players are involved,” he tells Carlson later in the lieutenant’s car, even going so far as to sound off the cheap-o cliché, “This goes straight to the top!” Carlson finally begins to give their investigation some careful consideration while Holder goes to visit Linden at the hospital. She has been drugged out of her head after a scuffle with some orderlies and Holder promises to get her out. Ultimately, that promise is fulfilled by Linden’s ex-fiancée Rick, who has the power to release her from the ward, but wants nothing more to do with her. With Linden out of the ward, the two move on to continue the investigation.</p>
<p>And through all of this, the Richmond campaign continues to gain steam as Richmond (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001004/" target="_blank">Billy Campbell</a>) attends an event where he shoots a few hoops with some kids. A video of the event goes up on YouTube and a happy Gwen proudly shows Richmond, “Look! It’s gone viral!”Apparently in the world of <em>The Killing</em>, an internet video need only cap out at 1,200 views to go viral and in the closing moments of the show, we see Gwen paying someone off for their work on that video, which in reality she got pretty short changed on. Also closing the show is fleeting shots of construction continuing on the tenth floor of the casino, overseen by Chief Jackson, where the city ID badge still rests on the floor, no doubt to be the lynchpin piece of evidence that will blow the case wide open.</p>
<p>At its best, <em>The Killing</em> is still an uneven show, as this episode clearly demonstrates. The clever angle of putting Linden in a psych ward instead of killing or kidnapping her shows that the show can indeed be smart, especially when that angle is executed well. It’s difficult with a day-to-day timeline to get any kind of character nuance, so to take a breath and get some insight into the main character is a welcome change of pace, which is not made at the expense of the investigation- the investigation that has neatly brought in all suspects from the entire series and tied them to the murder in some fashion, so as not to make unrelated aspects of the investigation seem like flagrant misdirects and random non sequiturs. On the other hand, the Larsen storylines continue to land prominently in the who-gives-a-shit realm and once again, Mitch is nowhere to be seen and to be honest, I hope we never hear from her again.</p>
<p>The pieces are in play to make <em>The Killing</em>’s season finale satisfying enough, though it’s still hard to say if they arduous journey will be worth the effort.</p>
<p>Season 2, Episode 10: &#8220;72 Hours&#8221; (original airdate May 27, 2012)</p>
<p><em>The Killing</em> airs Sundays at 9/8c on AMC.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78815" title="SYTYCD_NYC_0040" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SYTYCD_NYC_0040-207x300.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="300" />If <em><a href="file:///C:/Users/Nishka/Documents/Poptimal/SYTYCD/SYTYCD%209/fox.com/dance">So You Think You Could Dance</a></em> could have the best chance of finding an innumerable number of dance wannabees, it’d be in Los Angeles. And nothing makes me happier than watching <a href="http://officiallycatdeeley.com/">Cat Deeley</a> strut down Hollywood Boulevard. Mary Murphy, Nigel Lythgoe and Jesse Tyler Ferguson (Yay! One of my favorite guest judges) made some hard choices this audition round. Now onto the…</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>HIGHLIGHTS</strong></span><br />
<strong>Alexa Anderson</strong>, 19, made it to the green mile last season but couldn’t clinch a spot. From my memory, she came back this season way more powerful and self-assured, and we all know <em>SYTYCD </em>loves a confident, female dancer. Technically, she was strong, but emotionally, she didn’t wow me, especially since she needed to use a wind machine at the beginning of her routine – really? Yet, there’s no denying that she’s talented. She heads straight to Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Eliana Gerard</strong>, 20, is a contemporary dancer who attended <a href="http://joffreyballetschool.reachlocal.com/?scid=598792&amp;kw=2223600">Joffrey</a> and <a href="http://www.alvinailey.org/">Alvin Ailey</a> and joined Cirque du Soleil’s <em><a href="http://www.cirquedusoleil.com/en/shows/viva-elvis/default.aspx">Viva Elvis</a></em> production as a dancer and aerialist. She will be immortalized as the first pole dancer on <em>SYTYCD </em>to come off as sensual and not just slutty. While her package was a little evocative, her audition showed off her fabulous training. Standing O for you, Not-Stripper! Off to Vegas!</p>
<p>Twins <strong>Nick and James Aragon</strong>, the Ninja Twins, are “A-list celebrities on a B-list budget.” They were set-up to be complete duds, and surprisingly the bitchy, silly brothers were surprisingly good – not <em>SYTYCD</em>-level good but definitely learned and funny.  They also auditioned knowing that 37 years old was over the 30-year age limit so the judges didn’t have to feel bad about sending them packing. Jesse was right, these two do need their own reality show.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Lenarz</strong>, 18, was kicked out of her home and is now living with her friend and her friend’s family. Stop whining; you’re an adult now. Dance, Sam! And she does beautifully. It’s hard to believe someone who can move so angelically has a mother who would give her the boot instead of supporting her. Nigel warned her to make sure that each move is not an exercise and is more artistic, and Mary said that the choreographers on the show could free her up. Now, she just has to release her past and let go on the stage. She’s sent to the choreography round where she glides on through.</p>
<p><strong>Megan Branch</strong>, 18, is another powerful, assertive dancer who displayed both grace and strength with such ease. She really captivated the judges, and I agreed that she had that fire in her eyes. Nigel, again, encouraged her to let loose in the future, but sent her straight to Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Cole Haribe</strong>, 26, merged two interesting mediums: martial arts and dance. Instead of choosing one or the other, he blended the two. Best idea ever. I’ve always viewed martial arts like a tango but to watch the two combined together so well was amazing to see. His power, his character presence and his speed were just like Mary said, “Spectacular.” No question for the judges that this one should head right to Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Jacobsen</strong>, 22, according to Nigel, “should be shot.” He’s been dancing ballet for 17 years – not ballet, ballet, but some weird mixture of jerking, ballroom strutting and odd leaps. It was horrible. It looked like what I imagine Kevin Bacon, circa <em>Footloose, </em>would look like attempting ballet, and the kid dances with the Cincinnati Ballet! Basically, some dancers just weren’t meant to choreograph. They ask him to dance one more time, and he’s a whole new, AMAZINGLY talented person. He’s so lucky he got a second chance and was kicked in the rear to Vegas. He ended as a highlight but should be stuck in this category for being such an idiot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LOWLIGHTS</strong></span><br />
<strong>Jontel “Johnny Waacks” Gibson</strong>, 20, is a whacker inspired by Princess Lockeroo from Season 8, and he’s been “whacking” a long time. The judges had fun with all the whacking double entendres. His style of whacking definitely had a disco flair to it, but sorry, this will never be a style of dance that’s interesting to watch longer than 5 minutes. Because of his musicality and insistence that he can dance contemporary or hip hop, the judges sent him through to the choreography round where he couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78816" title="SYTYCD_NYC_0019" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SYTYCD_NYC_0019-207x300.jpg" alt="" width="207" height="300" />Caley Carr</strong>, 22, got bit by the rhythm bug at a young age since tapping allowed him to make as much noise as he wanted without being yelled at. Unfortunately, his movements seemed like he was working hard but not doing very much, and though his personality seemed laid-back, he came off stiff to me. Still the judges liked him and his style, and sent him to the choreography rounds. What do I know about tap anyway? There, though, he doesn’t know enough about other styles to go any further.</p>
<p><strong>David Matz</strong>, 27, is a circus performer who dances with a cyr wheel, a huge metal ring. Sounds slightly ridiculous but is actually pretty beautiful to watch. It takes the fluidity of dancing to another level. However, this isn’t a show about America’s favorite circus act. The performance would even do well on a show like <em>America’s Got Talent</em>, but this is about dancing and you can only go so long without allowing your feet to touch the ground. To see what he could truly do on a stage, the judges send him to the choreography round but he can’t even make it through rehearsals.</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Anzalone</strong>, 25, returned after coming off supremely arrogant in a previous audition. He can definitely do some odd things with his body. That standing split into a forward split into on the stage made me wince with pain and awe. Sadly, he hasn’t seemed to improve his skills, and Nigel correctly pointed out that he danced less than he contorted, and his moves were cheesy and gimmicky. When he commented he’s trained in every style but ballroom and knows “how to dance with girls,” Nigel decided to embarrass him for his prior transgression and take some poor, unassuming stranger with him. After throwing his leg around her, the two grind a bit before he starts smacking her butt and Jesse Tyler Fergusen ambushes him on stage with a dollar bill. Mary wanted to send him to Vegas, but the guys had only seen enough dancing to get him to the choreography round where he just wasn’t strong enough.</p>
<p><strong>Jasmine and Marshea Mason</strong>, 18 and 22, are siblings who got into a car crash that left Mashea in a coma for 2 days and severely injured. Dancing isn’t just a passion to these two, it’s a gift, and you can feel that in how they move. Marshea had auditioned before, but for Jasmine it was her first time, and she’ll remember the moment for the rest of her life. She was electric and effervescent. Marshea’s presence was a little more subtle but equally magnificent to watch. The fact that he’d basically broken his neck six weeks ago might have boosted my opinion. They both earned their tickets to Vegas.</p>
<p>Twenty-one dancers moved on to Sin City, and up next week is Atlanta where Cat teased “things will get seriously steamy.” Now, sound off! Who was your favorite dancer this week? And shouldn’t JTF be instated permanently on the panel? So happy to be back with you guys, Season 9 is on!</p>
<p>Season 9, Episode 2: Auditions #3 &#8211; Los Angeles (originally aired May 30, 2012)</p>
<p><em>So You Think You Can Dance </em>airs Wednesday night at 8 p.m. EST on FOX.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Roughness-2.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-78802" title="Roughness 2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Roughness-2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="267" /></a>I’m a pop culture junkie, and I love it all – from music to film to television.  Many of my counterparts complain that the state of music is at an all-time low.  I’m not sure I agree with that sentiment, but the same certainly cannot be said for television.  Right now there are so many great television options on both network and cable TV &#8211; from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/" target="_blank"><em>Game of Thrones</em> </a>to <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1837576/" target="_blank">Scandal</a></em> to <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1758429/" target="_blank">Spartacus</a></em>.  I can’t watch them all; it takes mental effort and time to get invested in yet another television show.  That being said, I’ve recently discovered a gem that was under my nose the entire time.  If you haven’t already, I strongly recommend that you add USA’s <em><a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/necessaryroughness/" target="_blank">Necessary Roughness </a></em>to your rotation, or at least your DVR.</p>
<p>The show kicks off its second season on June 6, and I can’t wait to see what’s in store after an explosive first season finale.  Centered on a fictional New York football team called the Hawks, <em>Necessary Roughness </em>takes a peek into the fascinating world of sports psychology.  Actress <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0861361/" target="_blank">Callie Thorne </a>stars as team psychiatrist Dani Santino, or “Dr. Dani,” as she’s affectionately called.  The role is based on real-life psychiatrist Dr. Donna Dannenfelser, who was a psychotherapist with the New York Jets.  I think professional athletes present a unique set of therapeutic challenges, from psychological pressures to live up to the expectations placed upon them, to feelings of inadequacy when their skills begin to decline.  The source material is rich, and I appreciate the juxtaposition of legitimate psychological issues alongside the recurring storylines of the complex characters.</p>
<p>I recently had the pleasure of visiting the set of <em>Necessary Roughness</em> on location in Atlanta, and I had the opportunity to discuss the direction of the show with executive producer Kevin Dowling.  He shared behind-the-scenes insight regarding the second season, including a sharper focus on the Hawks’ off-season.  I thought that was an important new wrinkle in the show and it belies the attention to detail that makes <em>Necessary Roughness</em> so effective.  During my set visit I was struck by the painstaking efforts that were taken to create an authentic professional sports team environment.  The football scenes are even filmed in the Georgia Dome rather than a sound stage.  Viewers may be unaware of such details, but these nuances add to the quality of writing and the show as a whole.  For example, when I visited the Hawks team meeting room on set, I noticed a detailed draft board that identified fictional draft picks the team was targeting.  As an NFL football fan, I appreciated the preparation involved in creating a realistic team atmosphere.</p>
<p>USA Network not only opened the set, but allowed several writers to speak with executive producer Kevin Dowling.  Given the new focus on the Hawks’ off-season, we can expect more character development as the action moves away from the gridiron.  Season 2 promises more insight into ancillary characters like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0169753/" target="_blank">Scott Cohen’s </a>Nico, who is head of the Hawks’ security.  The writers are seeking to flesh out his character more, perhaps revealing a more personal side to the stoic former SEAL.  In addition to further character development, viewers can expect the same glimpse into Dr. Santino’s practice beyond the Hawks, as she treats other professional athletes with unique psychological setbacks.</p>
<p>Visiting the set of <em>Necessary Roughness</em> was a real treat, as I observed the careful research, creativity and attention to detail that goes into producing a successful television show.  Kevin Dowling exhausts all measures to ensure the show’s authenticity – from consulting professional athletes about football culture to crafting the perfect set pieces.  I really felt like I was at an NFL facility while visiting the set.  I share Dowling’s enthusiasm for the show’s future, and if the rough cut of the season 2 premiere I saw was any indication – that future looks mighty bright.</p>
<p>The second season of <em>Necessary Roughness</em> airs Wednesday, June 6th at 10/9c on USA Network.</p>

<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Girls-S1E7_3.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-78780" title="Girls S1E7_3" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Girls-S1E7_3.jpg" alt="" width="424" height="244" /></a>Oh. My. God. So I know every week I say that this episode of <em>Girls</em><em> </em>was the best, but this one really, really took the cake. We had four solid storylines, lots of laughs, and some character development. What more can you want?</p>
<p>So Hannah, Shoshanna, Jessa, and Marnie go to a big warehouse party in hopes that it’s going to be the best party ever. Charlie’s band is playing, and Marnie is hoping to avoid a scene while Shoshanna arrives way early and doesn’t talk to anyone until the others get there. On the way to the party, Jessa gets a text from a number she doesn’t recognize, but instead of asking who it is, she decides to play around and tells the person to come to the party.</p>
<p>When they get to the party, Marnie goes to say hello to Charlie, to be polite. But after a short conversation, she discovers he’s there with another girl. It’s been two weeks, and he has a new girlfriend. She spends the rest of the night whining to anyone who will listen, including Elijah, Hannah’s ex, who wastes no time in telling her that she is as selfish as Hannah is. He also reveals that they once made out in college behind Hannah’s back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jessa starts chatting up Charlie’s friend, Ray. They’re interrupted by Shoshanna, who is clearly on something. She thinks she smoked pot, but it’s very clear she did not. She had accidentally smoked crack. Shoshanna is terrified, but Jessa promises to take care of her. That promise goes out the door, however, when she sees her boss’ husband walk into the party. She pushes Shoshanna off on Ray, who is resistant but agrees.  The minute Jessa leaves, though, Shoshanna takes off running, leading Ray on a crazy chase in the streets. Then Shoshanna ends up kicking Ray in the groin before realizing that Ray was trying to help her. She gives him a “non-sexual” groin massage, and the two kind of share a moment. Could this be Shoshanna’s future deflowerer? He did make a joke about being her “first,” though it was about her using her self-defense skills on a real person for the first time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jessa’s boss’ husband arrives with a bottle of wine – wrong kind of party dude.  They end up getting into a fight with some punks and he gets beat up. At the hospital, he starts to cry, like he’s having an emotional breakdown, and asks Jessa to stay the night with him. She turns him down, saying she can’t keep doing this sort of thing. Then he calls her a tease. Well, there goes his chance of getting laid.</p>
<p>Then there’s Hannah.  Aside from Shoshanna and the accidental crack smoking, this was my favorite storyline. She sees Adam at the party – it’s the first time she’s seen him with a shirt on (haha!) or outside of his apartment.  He’s there with friends, and at first she seems to want to avoid him, but he sees her. Surprisingly, he seems happy to see her, and his friends seem to know who she is. He tries to call her over, but she runs away. Later, Hannah meets Adam’s friend, Tako, who lets it slip that Adam is in Alcoholics Anonymous.  Also, that he loves books – THAT shocks me more.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Girls-S1E7_1.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-78776" title="Girls S1E7_1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Girls-S1E7_1.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="228" /></a>Adam is making a run to the scrap yard to get parts for this boat he wants to build, and he invites Hannah along on his bike.  She ends up falling off the bike, and then they get in a fight. While Hannah is pissed she didn’t know he was in AA, Adam turns it back around on her, saying that she never asked. For all of Hannah’s complaining about Adam, she has never asked him about his life. Instead she talks about herself and sleeps with him. “You don’t want to know me,” he says.   He even asks, “What do you want from me? Do you want me to be your boyfriend?”  While we don’t see Hannah’s answer, the next scene is Hannah in a cab with Marnie and Adam, grinning.</p>
<p>This made me see Adam so differently. While I usually am not a huge fan, this made me reexamine his and Hannah’s relationship.  It seemed, based on his reaction at the party and his friends’ reactions, that he likes her, but he assumes she doesn’t like him that way.  It really makes you reevaluate their dynamic. Great, great twist on the part of the writers.</p>
<p>I was so, so into this episode. I thought it showed growth for Jessa, added development for Adam, really showcased how awesome Shoshanna is, and just came together so freaking well. I wasn’t a huge fan of Marnie, but I never really am. Good for Charlie for moving on!</p>
<p>So do you agree? Was this episode as awesome for you as it was for me? Sound off in the comments!</p>
<p>Season 1, Episode 7: “Welcome to Bushwick a.k.a. the Crackcident” (original air date May 27, 2012).</p>
<p><em>Girls</em> airs Sunday night at 10:30 p.m. on HBO.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000226/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-78749" title="MIB saeed Adyani" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MIB-saeed-Adyani.jpg" alt="" width="206" height="224" />Will Smith</a> (<em>Seven Pounds</em>)<em> </em>is a proven commodity, his movies having grossed over 5 billion dollars worldwide.  Marketing one of his movies during a post-<em>Avengers</em> lull shouldn’t be difficult, and since Hollywood is fond of beating dead horses, it was only logical that Columbia Pictures decided to make the <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/" target="_blank">Men In Black </a></em>franchise a trilogy.  I’ll admit that I imagined <em>Men In Black III</em> to be a blatant money grab, but despite my reservations, it managed to add a new dimension to the series and was arguably the best installment yet.</p>
<p>Smith returns as Agent J, brash covert government agent and understudy to <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000169/" target="_blank">Tommy Lee Jones’ </a>(<em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>) Agent K.  Agent J is still a cocky loudmouth, but now he has the experience to back it up.  Agent K was his mentor and although J complained about him, none of his subsequent partners measured up to the grisly vet after his brief retirement.  Only a unique individual would find comfort in the anonymity of the Men In Black, a secret police force charged with protecting Earth from alien life forms.  In addition to policing aliens, the MIBs are an immigration and safety agency, helping the aliens co-exist with humanity, unbeknownst to the masses. </p>
<p>The Agency is really tested when an infamous alien criminal named Boris the Animal escapes from the lunar prison he’s inhabited for the past 40 years.  He’s hell-bent on punishing the man who put him there, none other than Agent K, who apprehended Boris back in 1969 at Cape Canaveral.  Boris’ arm was shot off in the process, and he’d love nothing more than to go back in time and wipe out Agent K before he maims him.  However, if Agent K’s life is cut short in 1969, he will not go on to create the Arcnet, a global defense system that includes a force field that shields the planet from alien invaders.  This is important because if Boris is allowed to alter history, his alien race of Boglodite brethren will not be rendered extinct and will ultimately invade and destroy the Earth. </p>
<p>Needless to say, it is critical that Boris be stopped.  Agent J travels back in time to 1969 to save K’s life, thereby saving humanity.  He tries to stay as far away as possible from K, focusing instead on Boris.  Eventually J and K’s paths cross, and J tries to convince a 29-year-old K to help him nab Boris, declining to mention that K’s own life is in danger.  J has a small window in which to operate, and Boris seems to be one step ahead of him.  There are infinite permutations of destiny that can fatefully occur, and the odds are against J.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MIB-brolin.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-78751" title="MIB brolin" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MIB-brolin.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="195" /></a>In the first two <em>Men in Black</em> movies, Tommy Lee Jones had top billing over Will Smith.  This time it is Smith who clearly deserves top billing, whether because his career has blossomed tremendously since the last sequel or because Jones isn’t featured much in this third installment.  Instead, it is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000982/" target="_blank">Josh Brolin </a>(<em>No Country For Old Men</em>) who steals the show as the younger Agent K.  His southern deadpan is spot-on, and he sounds and looks just like Agent K, albeit a much younger and more handsome version.  Smith was fine in his role, but I don&#8217;t think much was required of him.  I actually thought his first few lines fell flat in their delivery.  Eventually he found his groove and was his usual charismatic self, but I remained more impressed with Josh Brolin. </p>
<p>I was skeptical about this movie, but it didn’t feel like a total re-tread, and the special effects advanced the storyline nicely.  The depiction of a 1960’s Manhattan was interesting, though not entirely original.  Director <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001756/" target="_blank">Barry Sonnenfeld </a>presented a straightforward plot, but managed to have some fun with the time period, and of course &#8211; the aliens.  One of the funnier scenes involved Agent J at a party at Andy Warhol&#8217;s &#8220;factory,&#8221;  where it is revealed that Warhol is an alien.  Given his talent and eccentricity, this real-life addition to the plot was clever.  The Men In Black have always been a seemingly futuristic organization, and it was interesting to see that anachronistic concept play out in the past of 1969.  With enough cool tricks to please young and old viewers alike, <em>Men In Black III</em> made for a pretty good day at the movies. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, the first real battle of <a title="Game of Thrones" href="http://hbo.com/game-of-thrones/index.html" target="_blank"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a> took shape. As Stannis Baratheon’s fleet stormed the shores of King’s Landing, Cersei proceeded to drink all the wine in sight and Tyrion tried his best to rally the desperate citizens of the kingdom.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sansa.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78742" title="Sansa" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Sansa-300x168.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="168" /></a>At sea, as the Baratheon fleet approaches King’s Landing, Davos and his son argue about whose god(s) will protect them. Matthos believes that once they’ve won the iron throne, thanks to his god, Davos will be the new hand of the king. Meanwhile, Tyrion is lying in bed with Shae, worried about how to keep the city from falling.</p>
<p>Cersei, enjoying her first glass of wine of the night, seeks council with Maester Pycelle. Having none to give, he offers Cersei a vial of nightshade, a deadly poison, in case she should choose another way out. In a tavern, Bronn leads a drinking song with the goldcoats, offering to buy a round for the Hound when he enters. The tense moment between the two gets ready to boil, Bronn’s hand grasping a dagger behind his back, when the alarm sounds, signaling the time for battle is finally at hand. At sea, Davos orders drums to answer the tolling bell in King’s Landing.</p>
<p>As the Lannisters prepare for battle, Joffrey calls Sansa out to kiss his new sword, a sort of wish of luck. Sansa sasses Joffrey a little, trying to trick him into marching with the vanguard, because that’s where Robb would be and he’s just a pretender. Shae hopes Joffrey won’t come back, but Sansa knows the worst ones always survive.</p>
<p>As they gather at the walls of the city, Joffrey is confused where all of his ships are, as only one is sailing out to meet Stannis’. He demands answers from Tyrion, threatening to cut him in half. Tyrion jokes “quarter man” doesn’t have the same ring to it, and ignores his nephew’s requests.</p>
<p>Sansa and Shae wait in the red keep with the other high born women and children of the royal family. Cersei summons Sansa to share a glass of wine with her, ordering the heads of two horse thieves mounted on spears to keep deserters from rising up. Meanwhile, Davos <a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BowArrow.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78740" title="BowArrow" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BowArrow-300x192.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="192" /></a>orders his archers ready, confused as to why only one seemingly unmanned boat sails to meet them. Then, he sees the green liquid pouring out of it and a single flaming arrow fired by Bronn from the shore. The ship and its hidden weapon are ignited, exploding into green flame and spreading to every nearby vessel. Stannis rallies his men to take the shore while Tyrion and his men watch from the wall.</p>
<p>Cersei, a few more glasses in, mocks Sansa for leading a few others in prayer. She muses about how when Stannis takes the city, she’ll be forced to attempt to seduce him, explaining to Sansa that her best weapon is between her legs. Cersei also wishes she were born a man, so she could escape having to be cooped up with crying women during battles.</p>
<p>The battle thickens as Stannis leads his men onto shore, trying to break down the gates. Tyrion orders archers to fire on them as they try and raise ladders to breach the wall. Tyrion also sends the Hound out with some men to meet them head on. Stannis and his men are failing to breach the gate, but overwhelm the Hound and his forces and start to move up the wall.</p>
<p>Joffrey, being the rock for his people that he is, looks like he’s about to wet himself when the Hound quits the battle, having been slightly off his game thanks to all of the fire, and renounces his king. Lancel comes, having been sent by Cersei to bring Joffrey in, and he cowardly goes to hide from the fight as his men question why they should continue. Tyrion, feeling like he’s losing them, makes a rousing speech about needing to defend their country. He leads them out a secret gate and around to overwhelm Stannis’ men before they can break down the mud gate. Just when it looks like they’ve won, another group of Baratheon bannermen come round and one lands a crippling blow across Tyrion’s face.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Tyrion.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78743" title="Tyrion" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Tyrion-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Cersei hears the battle is going south, so she grabs her youngest son Tommen, and heads for the throne room. Shae tells Sansa this is her chance, and tells her to run and barricade herself in her chamber, needing to stay behind to see Tyrion. When she reaches her room, she’s surprised the Hound is there. He tells her he plans to run off, and she’s more than a little scared of him in this moment. Still, he offers to take her back to Winterfell, and though she’s hesitant, when he goes to leave, she drops the doll she’d been clutching.</p>
<p>As Tyrion lies on the battlefield, slipping away, Tywin’s forces ride in and overwhelm the Baratheon men, who need to drag Stannis off the wall to get him to safety. In the throne room, Cersei tells a story to Tommen about a mother and her cub, and how one day all men will bow to him. She uncaps the nightshade and brings it to his lips when crashes start hitting the throne room door. She’s shocked when in bursts Tywin, and she drops the bottle, letting it shatter on the ground as he tells her they’ve won.</p>

I have now let a few minutes go by and am no longer speechless, but holy crap - last night's episode of Mad Men? I can't even begin to describe how stunningly beautiful and well crafted it was. And I'm trying to chill out a little bit but I'm so ridiculously tempted to call this my new favorite episode of television ever. ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/episode-11-don2.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78733" title="episode-11-don2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/episode-11-don2-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>Sweet tits of heaven I am speechless by what I have just seen&#8230;</p>
<p>(momentary pause)</p>
<p>I have now let a few minutes go by and am no longer speechless, but holy crap &#8211; last night&#8217;s episode of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0804503/fullcredits#cast"><em>Mad Men</em></a>? I can&#8217;t even begin to describe how stunningly beautiful and well crafted it was. And I&#8217;m trying to chill out a little bit but I&#8217;m so ridiculously tempted to call this my new favorite episode of television ever. Yes, more than the Season Two finale of <em>The West Wing, </em>more than the &#8220;A Benihana Christmas&#8221; episode of <em>The Office</em>, and more than that episode of <em>Flavor of Love </em>when Hottie tried to cook a raw chicken in the microwave. &#8220;The Other Woman&#8221; was just that good.</p>
<p>What made it so good, you might ask? Let me count the ways:</p>
<p>1. The acting.</p>
<p>2. The acting.</p>
<p>3. The script.</p>
<p>4. The acting.</p>
<p>5. Everything else.</p>
<p>Sorry if that was less than helpful. I&#8217;m just kind of all aflutter right now so it might be best to just go through bit by bit what happened on this small screen gem.</p>
<p>In recent weeks we&#8217;ve found out that Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce is in contention to take on Jaguar as a client. Having a car on your client list can take an ad firm from the basement to the penthouse so the gang is pulling out all the stops to nail this pitch with long brainstorming sessions on the artistic end and lots of schmoozing on the business end.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen a lot of wining and dining of potential clients on <em>Mad Men </em>with even an occasional bit of prostitution thrown in but things took a slightly darker turn this week when one of the crucial votes from Jaguar suggested that he&#8217;d need a night with the gorgeous Joan Harris to support their pitch. Most people would immediately swat this notion aside but the man from Jaguar wasn&#8217;t proposing this to any normal person. He proposed it to the sniveling Pete Campbell, who as you can probably imagine, didn&#8217;t let the idea die over drinks.</p>
<p>The next day Pete actually has the balls to bring it up to Joan under the context that they&#8217;ll lose the account if it doesn&#8217;t happen. Joan is naturally disgusted by the idea but makes the mistake of quipping &#8220;You can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221; This is apparently enough for nasty Pete to take it to the other partners and try to pool some money. There is a lot of shock when he brings it up and Don actually walks out insisting that the pitch itself will be good enough to sway them but the rest reluctantly agree that Joan is entitled to $50,000 if she decides to do it. Gross.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve known for awhile now that Lane has a little thing for Joan so he goes to talk to her about the issue, but instead of trying to dissuade her completely, he suggests that she should ask to become a partner in the firm with a 5% stake. There is certainly more disgust on Joan&#8217;s party but knowing her situation becoming a single mother we start to see her be tempted. And sure enough she goes to Pete with the offer to become a partner, which he accepts. As she leaves his office asking which man it is (he&#8217;s quite disgusting by the way) Pete responds sheepishly with &#8220;He&#8217;s not bad.&#8221; Her brilliant response: &#8220;He&#8217;s doing this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pete then goes to break the news to Don who is still convinced that the work alone will win the client over after a great idea from whiz kid Ginsberg. Don immediately races to Joan&#8217;s apartment to talk her out of it. He thinks he&#8217;s convinced her but the deed has actually already been done as revealed in a brilliantly edited and written sequence juxtaposing Don&#8217;s pitch to Jaguar and Joan&#8217;s evening with the pig of a man. It is false seduction on both sides but it pays off as SCDP gets the good news that they have secured the client.</p>
<p>The news is met with champagne and celebration but Don is completely gutted when he sees Joan enter the room as a partner and realizes how they actually earned the client. The look on his face says it all and it is heartbreaking. The firm has sold its soul and a good person is now shamed as a common hooker. Who could have seen this coming?</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/episode-11-pete.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78734" title="episode-11-pete" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/episode-11-pete-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a>But Don is in for another heartbreak that day. For a long time now Peggy has been treated as an afterthought by Don. She has been abused, under-appreciated, and recently outshone by Michael Ginsburg as the new kid on the block. All season long we&#8217;ve seen signs of Peggy growing tired of her work life and it all came to a head this week with good old Freddy Rumsen (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0615063/">Joel Murray</a>) flying in on a piece of pie to push her out the door and into the arms of another firm.</p>
<p>Peggy meets with a rival ad man who has long been a thorny douche to Don and makes an offer that Peggy literally cannot refuse. So right after the Jaguar news breaks Peggy pulls Don into his office and gives her two week notice. At first Don takes this to be a ploy for a raise but she makes it clear that no amount of money will get her to stay. There is a flash of resentment as he asks her to leave immediately rather than in two weeks but then we see how truly crushed he is when instead of merely shaking Peggy&#8217;s hand he takes it and kisses it gently as a tear rolls down her cheek.</p>
<p>This episode was called &#8220;The Other Woman&#8221; and there are many reasons why: Jaguar cars are often referred to as a mistress, the man that Joan has to sleep with is married, and even Peggy&#8217;s job hunt is made out to be a bit like cheating on SCDP. But let&#8217;s be honest, the true meaning of this title is Peggy. Even though their relationship has never been sexual or romantic, Peggy has always been the other woman for Don. They have shared moments more powerful than anything we&#8217;ve seen with either of his wives or any of the mistresses. These are two people who probably understand each other better than anyone else does and seeing them say goodbye was a major punch to the gut. And as expected <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0358316/">Jon Hamm</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005253/">Elisabeth Moss</a> played it to perfection.</p>
<p>We then see Peggy gather her belongings quietly as everyone else celebrates Jaguar and walk towards the elevator without a single goodbye. Only Joan catches a glimpse of her leaving and although we expect something to happen as she waits for the elevator in this moment of somber farewell, no one comes running. Instead, the elevator beeps its arrival and the soundtrack starts to blast The Kinks&#8217; &#8220;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2GmzyeeXnQ&amp;feature=related">You Really Got Me</a>&#8221; as a smile comes across Peggy&#8217;s face. She is finally free to use her talent to take the advertising world by storm and well, that moment is pure bliss.</p>
<p>And with that Peggy is gone.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen much of the world of <em>Mad Men</em> through her eyes since episode one and I&#8217;ll be fascinated to see how her departure changes the show. Its hard to imagine it without her but as we&#8217;ve seen numerous times in the past, Matthew Weiner is not afraid to let characters go and continue on as they would in a realistic way. It&#8217;s one of the reasons why I think this is the best show on television and though I will lament the loss of Peggy I wish Elisabeth Moss nothing but the best in her career. She has shown stunning talent in her five years with <em>Mad Men </em>and I know we haven&#8217;t seen the last of her.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m afraid this article has already gone on for too long but I&#8217;d be remiss if I didn&#8217;t make mention of these remaining points now that there are only two episodes left of this season:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pete continues to spat with Trudy about their living situation in the burbs. &#8220;Its an epic poem for me to get home!&#8221; Could another divorce be on the way?</li>
<li>Teeth nailed an audition and got a sleazy call back. We don&#8217;t know if she got the role yet but if she does it means 8 weeks of rehearsal in Boston. Don doesn&#8217;t love this but will he support it?</li>
<li>And poor Lane. Last week he stole some money from the firm and this week it was confirmed that the partners will not be getting bonuses this year to cover it. His theft will certainly be discovered so can we expect another big departure before the season is out?</li>
</ul>
<p>Post your predictions and thoughts below. I hope you all enjoyed this great hour of television as much as I did. Here&#8217;s hoping for two more!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AGT-S7E3+4.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-78716" title="AGT S7E3+4" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AGT-S7E3+4.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="288" /></a>This week, <em><a href="http://www.nbc.com/americas-got-talent/">Americas Got Talent</a></em><em> </em>stopped off in New York City, where auditions were held in the infamous Times Square, bringing a collection of the weird, the captivating, and the immensely talented. As usual, the show began with host Nick Cannon ridiculously yelling from atop the Empire State Building, and later, from the inside of a helicopter going over the city. This dude&#8217;s <em>craaaaaazy!!!!</em><em> </em>The other familiar site on the show was the always high-on-sugar (or crack) audience, who overreacts to everything as if it&#8217;s the most amazing thing they have ever seen in their entire lives. This continues to be hilarious, especially since the show now cuts to random audience members who yell out obviously pre-scripted remarks to the person next to them. They are trying to fool the American public into thinking these are off the cuff comments, but they aren’t fooling anybody. <em>It is so phony, it’s laughable.</em><em> </em>Oh look! The camera just HAPPENED to be on that person in the crowd, and look! They are now saying something interesting to the person next to them. Wow! What a coincidence! Lame!!!</p>
<p>Here are some of the highlights, lowlights, and memorable moments from the NYC audition experience:</p>
<p>*<strong>The Flyte Cru</strong><strong> </strong>was a risky group of men who did a combination of acrobats and basketball stunts set to music. It was slightly dangerous and captivating to watch, and they got through. Also getting through were the traditional Irish dancers with a modern twist, and creepy masks, <strong>NY Irish Dance Company.</strong><strong> </strong>Aside from humans, there was one animal act that was quite compelling in their own right. With a slew of labradoodle dogs that jumproped, backflipped, and did many more impressive tricks; <strong>Olate Dogs</strong><strong> </strong>sported a father/son dog trainer team from South America. Their first round was great, and I’m curious to see how far they can take their tricks.</p>
<p>*One moment on the show that demonstrated perhaps a different, softer side to judge Howard Stern, was the performance by 7 year old rapper-singer <strong>Mir Money.</strong><strong> </strong>Early in his performance, Stern was the first to buzz him. A bit later, Sharon followed. When the kid finished and was being given critique by the judges, he started to shake and cry. He was obviously really nervous. He&#8217;s a little kid, and this was a bit overwhelming for him. Stern felt terrible, and wondered out loud to the audience if he was cut out for this judging gig. He felt so badly, he ran onstage and hugged the little boy, trying to make him feel better. They did not put him through, and Stern said to the crowd: &#8220;I’m not cut out for this. I hated that.&#8221;</p>
<p>*One of the weirder acts was a man who called himself simply <strong>Horse.</strong><strong> </strong>Basically, he came out in a strange outfit, and had a bunch of other weird dudes punch his balls, kick him in the balls, and use various objects to hurt his balls such as pieces of plywood, a mallet, and bricks. Howard Stern laughed his ass off, delighting in this act, and at the end, Nick Cannon was asked to join the fun and also kick the man in the balls to prove that the act was real and he wasn’t wearing a jockstrap or protection. He received a standing ovation, and Stern compared him to The Three Stooges and Jackass. Howie Mandel crowned him &#8220;The King of the Nut Shot.&#8221; He went through to Vegas, of course.</p>
<p>*Two completely different, but equally interesting, musical style acts were <strong>The Illest,</strong><strong> </strong>a group of NYC adult men who rapped, sang, and played a variation of violins, guitars, etc in a band; and <strong>All Beef Patty</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong>a pretty good singer dressed in an unforgettable drag outfit that included a bright pink wig, lipstick, and a strange looking dress.</p>
<p>*<strong>Burton Crane</strong><strong> </strong>provided some insane entertainment when he came out with a Casio in one hand and a microphone in the other, and started rapping a song he wrote called &#8220;Whatcha Gonna Do?&#8221; What made him so unique was his age – 77. Calling himself the &#8220;Grandfather of Rap,&#8221; he claimed to actually start the trend of rapping himself. The song was extremely annoying, and also extremely catchy. The crazy-ass audience all stood up and started chanting the chorus/line, which was a bit much and obviously the producers told them to do this. Stern said, &#8220;At first, I hated you, but then I found myself singing that stupid chorus.&#8221; He got through to Vegas on his silly song, and claims he has written hundreds more. We shall see how brilliant they are.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AGT-S7E3+4_2.jpg"><img class="alignleft  wp-image-78717" title="AGT S7E3+4_2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AGT-S7E3+4_2.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="284" /></a>*When the bizarre, 23-year-old dancer-singer <strong>Ronald Charles</strong><strong> </strong>started his odd performance with a countdown from 7 down to 1 &#8230;and then did nothing &#8230; he was buzzed by the judges. Howard Stern&#8217;s father, who was in the audience, called the man a &#8220;canook,&#8221; and then he and Howard went onstage to give the young man a talking to, with Stern&#8217;s father passing on to the man the same message he used to give to his son Howard when he did something dumb. &#8220;Don’t be stupid, ya moron!&#8221; This was a funny moment, even if it did feel a bit forced by producers so America could fall in love with Stern&#8217;s dad, but it was still effective.</p>
<p>*One of the most unique and powerful acts in NYC was the married couple <strong>Donovan and Rebecca,</strong><strong> </strong>a pair of acrobats, dancers, and aerial artists. The control and discipline it took to do what they were doing was simply stunning. This was a strange and beautiful performance. Stern called it &#8220;spectacular,&#8221; while Sharon said she felt like she was watching &#8220;a love scene out of a sci-fi movie. Beautiful.&#8221; The act ended with Rebecca holding a pose that sat Donovan&#8217;s entire body weight on her pelvic and ab area. Really amazing.</p>
<p>*There were two comedians in the mix of NYC auditions. The judges loved them both, but in my opinion, one shined way brighter and more unique than the other. <strong>John Pizzi,</strong><strong> </strong>a ventriloquist, didn’t use a typical puppet character for his act, but instead used a computerized giant screen that showed each of the three judges faces, and the mouths would move as Pizzi did the talking. He basically used the judges for his material, and I found it a little bit boring and typical. I always feel like it’s the easy way to get applause whenever an act uses the judges in their act. He made a bunch of jokes about the sexual tension between Howie and Sharon, Sharon and Howard, and Howard and Howie. They gave him a standing ovation. I didn’t really get it myself.</p>
<p>*The second comedian was 48 year old <strong>Tom Cotter,</strong><strong> </strong>a professional looking man who has been doing comedy for over 23 years. His material was hilarious, and his delivery style was crisp, sly, and surprising. Sharon said his timing was great, and that he was spot on. Stern said he genuinely laughed, and Howie called him polished, professional, and a star. I agree. I loved this guy, and found myself rooting for him offstage when I saw how humble he was to get such positive feedback. I hope he goes far.</p>
<p>*<strong>The Savage Men</strong><strong> </strong>were 4 adult, creepy muscle men, who looked like an older version of the cast of <em>Jersey Shore.</em><em> </em>This was basically a long, slow, painful striptease, ending in the men removing their shirts, and pulling down their pants to reveal tight undies and man-boob pecs. They were gym rats, basically. The audience all groaned and moaned and everyone was turned off. Howard Stern lightened the mood by claiming that he thinks most women aren’t turned on by those too-muscular type bodies, and that instead, they might like a body like his. Everyone cheered, and Stern joined the men onstage and performed a hilarious striptease dance, with a dollar bill hanging from the front of his pants. The crowd went insane for him, and the men did not get through to Vegas. They will have to go back to their gym on Route 4 in Paramus, and stare at themselves longingly in the mirrors there. What a shame.</p>
<p>Next Week: Auditions continue in Tampa Bay, Florida, and more wackiness ensues. Hopefully there will be a dude who likes to get punched in the nuts.</p>
<p>Season 7, Episode 3 and 4: New York (original airdates May 21 &amp; 22, 2012).</p>
<p>America’s Got Talent airs Monday and Tuesday nights at 8/7c on NBC.</p>

But will the mega-space filler go the way of its singing predecessor with slowly plummeting ratings again this year? Thursday night’s show opened with a montage of dancers and the simple statement that all year our televisions had been dominated by singers. This couldn’t be truer, or more irritating. But if <em>SYTYCD</em> is trying to separate itself from other musical shows, it’s going to be a daunting task because it’s essentially the same cast of dramatic characters, just on a dance level. And as long as Nigel Lythgoe and Simon Fuller are allowed to keep working, the chances of one of them cranking out another mundane duplicate talent show are likely. But what will be interesting to discover with this year’s <em>SYTYCD </em>is if Fox can manage to keep, or bring back, the same audience it once drew in seasons ago.</p>
<p>The two-hour debut episode started off with auditions in New York City and in Dallas, Texas. Host Cat Deeley was back along with judges Mary Murphy, Tyce Diorio, and Nigel Lythgoe, plus a large roster of talented, hopeful dancers. If <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> taught us anything this week, it was how to get an immediate ticket to the Las Vegas auditions, how to make an entire room cry, and how to properly get kicked off the audition stage.</p>
<p>Things started off great in NYC as many dancers breezed through their routines with ease, earning them Vegas tickets and allowing them to bypass the evening’s group audition round. A 1920’s inspired dancer named Amelia Lowe was the first to be handed a ticket and was soon joined by Philly street performer Shafeek Westbrook and Swiss ballet dancer, Chehon Wespi-Tschopp. A lot of the Vegas ticket holders weren’t just up there dancing for themselves, though, and many had stories of overcoming tragedy and rough times. For instance, young dancer Leo Reyes wanted to give purpose to his once suicidal mother’s life by giving her something to be really proud of and he definitely delivered. Of course, I can’t neglect to mention the utter ridiculousness that comes along with a reality show competition and it came in the form of a “dancer” named Austin Freeman whose personally created “Mr. Wiggles” style consisted of him convulsing on stage to the world’s most annoying song, “I’m Sexy and I Know It” by LMFAO. It was a tension-breaker in a room full of nervous auditioners but, sadly, there would be no Vegas ticket for Austin.</p>
<p>The Texas auditions were next up and professional choreographer Lil’ C stepped in to take Tyce’s place on the judging panel. This was probably the more interesting half of the week’s tour because there was a little bit of everything: touching stories, underdogs, and flat out morons. Bree Hafen, a Texas native, was the stay-at-home mom with a dream and her two young (and impossibly adorable) children were there to support her in a unique way. After her routine, her toddler daughter, adorned befittingly in a pink tutu, took the stage and imitated her mom’s moves, effectively melting the hearts of everyone in the room. It was a unanimous decision on a Vegas ticket for Bree.</p>
<p>There is always more than a few people who swear to have created their own, brand new, and never before seen styles and there were two gentlemen in particular who followed through on their promises. Stefeon “The Zombie” Stewart blew the judges away with a thoroughly entertaining horror movie-inspired routine that included some twisted faces and unusual contorting. It sounds bizarre but somehow he pulled it off. However, he wasn’t the only one with a macabre dance routine. Hampton “The Exorcist” Williams brought creepy dancing to a whole new level and boasted openly that he could basically steal your soul and return it to you. I thought this guy was going to be a total whack job for sure but after seeing his actual routine you could see just how deep Hampton was on an interpretive dance level. It was even spookier seeing Mary Murphy and some of audience members brought to literal tears over The Exorcist’s act.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MV5BNjQ2ODYzOTk4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU2MzM4Nw@@._V1.jpeg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78695" title="MV5BNjQ2ODYzOTk4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU2MzM4Nw@@._V1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MV5BNjQ2ODYzOTk4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjU2MzM4Nw@@._V1-224x300.jpg" alt="" width="224" height="300" /></a>The judges of <em>SYTYCD</em>, at the very least, support everyone in their quests to follow their dreams and Sam Sheffler, the young man from an autism studies university, was no exception.  He gave his all up on the stage and Nigel commended him for having the guts to participate in such an overwhelming production. He didn’t make it past this round but they encouraged him to never stop dancing. It was another great moment because you could see the camaraderie between Sam and the rest of the auditioners. But then came along Von “Legend” Kipper whose sole purpose was bringing the whole room down. In a pre-interview with Cat Deeley, Von made various negative statements about the show claiming he was “against auditioning” and “didn’t care for the show at all”. He wasted no time getting into an attitude-fueled argument with Nigel right off the bat where he even tried to backtrack on his idiotic and contradicting perspectives. Oh, then he had the nerve to bash the autistic guy in front of everyone saying that <em>SYTYCD</em> is for serious competitors only; the guy’s a real class act. The only thing he managed to accomplish was getting thrown out of the theater and conclusively looking like an ass in front of a good portion of America.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a pretty decent start to the new season. A ton of Vegas tickets were handed out and a lot of teary-eyed moments came up. Like <em>Idol</em>, all the blood, sweat, and tears that go into achieving a massive dream is what these reality competitions are really about and if <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> keeps up the momentum, we may actually have an exciting season on our hands.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/idol13.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78685" title="idol1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/idol13-300x222.png" alt="" width="300" height="222" /></a>The Nokia Theater in Los Angeles was abuzz with the excitement of seven-thousand <em>American Idol</em> fans, all there for the same exact reason: to experience the crowning of season eleven’s winner. It was a two night affair, as always, with the first night consisting of finalists Phillip Phillips and Jessica Sanchez duking it out on stage over three-rounds of competitive singing. Things went relatively smooth as they blew through all six stage performances briskly over the course of an hour.</p>
<p>These last performances were extremely critical because one slip up could alter the future for either singer indefinitely. Phillip had the winning strategy down, whether he realized it or not, when he opted to follow Jessica on each round and perform second. It was a smart move because typically the last experience of the night tends to leave the strongest impression on the crowd. Maybe Phillip never had anything to worry about all along, though, as he had been a fan favorite from the start; in fact, he had never even made it into the bottom three spot one single time. But, we can’t say Jessica had a weak following either. Despite almost being eliminated early on and then saved by the judges, she bounced right back and into the top. After the first night’s stage performances were over, it was hard to even guess who had the upper hand here because these two young singers couldn’t have been more different. It really became a case of comparing apples and oranges, or “the battle of the opposites” as described by Jennifer Lopez.</p>
<p>The next night was two hours of pure insanity. The entire top twelve was back to entertain the enormous crowd with various numbers, including one that paid tribute to Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb who had passed away this week. Each of the potential Idols and the contestants from eliminations past had the chance to take the stage and sing alongside some actual famous musical idols. Phillip paired up for two songs with singer John Fogerty and Joshua “Mantasia” Ledet teamed up with the real Fantasia for the song “Take Me to the Bayou”. Chaka Khan, Rhianna, Reba McEntire, and Neil Diamond showed up, plus Jennifer Lopez and Jordin Sparks performed. Even Steven Tyler managed to hobble up on stage with the rest of Aerosmith to sing a song or two, making it one star-studded event. And to top it all off, <em>Idol</em> alum Ace Young proposed marriage to his girlfriend, Diana DeGarmo, also a former contestant, live on the big stage which just added to the list of many <em>American Idol</em> firsts.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/idol23.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78686" title="idol2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/idol23-223x300.png" alt="" width="223" height="300" /></a>After the madness was finally over, host Ryan Seacrest took the stage and finally got down to business. <em>American Idol</em> received a literal world record of 132 million votes for the finale show. They say <em>Idol</em> ratings have been substantially low but it seemed that with each passing week leading up to the conclusion, the number of voters (or perhaps just votes) grew more and more. A vast majority of the votes counted worked in Phil Phillips’ favor this time around because before we knew it, the confetti was flying as he was declared the next <em>American Idol</em>. Poor Phil was in so much shock and disbelief that before even having a literal moment to process what was happening, Seacrest was shoving a guitar into the guy’s arms. The winner of <em>Idol</em> traditionally has to end the shenanigans with a winning song but Phillip was so genuinely moved by the event that he only made it about halfway through the song before going completely mute. Phillip Phillips was a fan favorite from the beginning, as well as my personal pick for the season, and with his unique style and carefree charm, he’s the refreshing change that <em>American Idol</em> really, truly needed.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Idol-May-21-2012.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78664" title="Idol May 21 2012" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Idol-May-21-2012-300x238.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="238" /></a>If <em>American Idol </em>has one guaranty<em>, </em>it is an extremely entertaining finale, and this year was no different. Whether the song choices, singer combinations, and performances are good or just plain trainwreck awful &#8211; they are <em>always </em>entertaining. This year&#8217;s final two couldn&#8217;t have been more different. Jessica Sanchez is a 16 year old girl with the pipes of a much more mature person, while Phillip Phillips and his guitar bring a gritty, earthy sound and a unique perspective on various songs. In the final two episodes, the two went head to head with 3 individual performances, and then they had some fun singing with their fellow Top 12 Idol contestants, and plenty of celebrity guests along the way.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk a bit about the singing first. The final two sang in three different rounds. Round One was a song chosen by producer Simon Fuller. (random. Since when have they even mentioned this dude&#8217;s name? Since never.) Round Two was Contestant&#8217;s favorite Song from the season (so basically, a repeat of something we have already heard them sing, which seems pointless), and Round Three was each Contestant&#8217;s Potential Winning Song. In other words, if they win the show, this would most likely be the song they release to the American public first. Im not sure who wrote these songs, but normally, they are pretty bad or at the very least, mediocre.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Sanchez </strong>started out with &#8220;I Have Nothing,&#8221; the Whitney classic. Vocally, it was pretty great, but I always have trouble when people sing Whitney because I just automatically think Whitney Houston was better. Randy liked it, J.Lo did, too, Tyler literally said nothing. In Round two, Sanchez repeated a performance of the song that got her into the Top 24, &#8220;The Prayer.&#8221; It was gorgeous and controlled. The third song, &#8220;Change Nothing,&#8221; was mediocre for me. I wouldn&#8217;t run out and buy it on iTunes or anything. The judges agreed that the song did not show off her immense talents as well as it could have.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Phillips, </strong>who has been putting off major kidney stone surgery for weeks so he could continue on the show, started with &#8220;Stand By Me.&#8221; It was nice. Mellow, genuine, soulful. For round two, he sang Billy Joel&#8217;s &#8220;Movin Out,&#8221; bringing his own personal twist to, as always. I liked the way he broke up the rhythms of the song, and thought it showcased his individuality. The third round was a song called &#8220;Home,&#8221; which really felt like it could be a huge hit with Phillip singing it. Randy said, &#8220;Loved the song, love you.&#8221; Tyler made his usual weird comment with &#8220;you&#8217;ve made the whole world your home.&#8221; Okay.</p>
<p>After both contestants performed, Snooze-in-a-Vest <em>Idol </em>winner Scotty McDreary performed to close out the first of two finale shows, as the audience was encouraged to vote one last time.</p>
<p>The Final Episode of the Season was, of course, the big Finale. This is where a big &#8216;ole music party erupts on the <em>Idol </em>stage for a full 2 hours, until the winner is finally announced 5 minutes before airtime is over. This finale was definitely memorable, and not always for positive reasons. Here are some highlights and lowlights of the evening:</p>
<p>*The Top 12 Idols were back again singing in their classic, Brady Bunch, variety show style for the opening number medley, which felt more like <em>So You Think You Can Dance </em>when it ended with two pro hip-hop dancers doing their thing in the center of the stage as the contestants clapped along.</p>
<p>*Randy Jackson ended the season by wearing an unfortunate necktie that was meant to look like the keys of a piano. This was tame, however, compared to the NUMEROUS horrible costume choices on the finale. (More on that soon.)<br />
*Phillip Phillips gave one of his most relaxed and &#8220;joyful&#8221; performances in singing &#8220;Bad Moon Rising&#8221; and &#8220;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&#8221; with one of his music heroes, <strong>John Fogerty. </strong>During the instrumental portions of the song, Phil and John jammed up there like a couple of old musicians who have known each other for years. It was cool.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78668" title="Fantasia and Joshua" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Fantasia-and-Joshua-300x203.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="203" />*Third place contestant and huge talent Joshua Ledet performed the Elton John song &#8220;Take Me to the Pilot&#8221; NOT with Elton John (I guess he didn&#8217;t want to be part of this travesty), but with past <em>Idol </em>winner <strong>Fantasia. </strong>I don&#8217;t know what to discuss first, the screechy sounds coming from Fantasia&#8217;s vocal chords, or the extremely unfortunate wardrobe choice by the woman of the same name. Holy Hell. Please, <a href="http://poptimal.com/">Poptimal</a>, you MUST post a picture of the &#8220;thing&#8221; that was Fantasia&#8217;s thigh, hanging from her too-tight catsuit like fatty sausage links. [<em>Ed. note: Sorry, that wasn't in the press photos</em>.]<em>Why on earth would you wear that??? </em>Why? There is simply no reason I can think of. When you are a celebrity, one would assume that several people are involved in what you wear on national television. There are producers, agents, friends, costume designers, stagehands, dressing room folk . . . endless amounts of people. Do they all hate her? Not one person thought this outfit was a terrible idea? My Lord. The song itself sounded like Joshua was singing while his sick cat meow-screeched along, but the outfit was worse. The funny part is that they broke to a commercial out of nowhere, mid-song. At least somebody had some sense to stop that trainwreck mid-ride. <em>YIKES!!!! </em></p>
<p>*Another &#8220;Yikes!&#8221; moment in music/outfits came not too soon afterwards, when the Top 5 females performed a medley of &#8220;Ain&#8217;t Nobody,&#8221; &#8220;Through the Fire,&#8221; and &#8220;Im Every Woman&#8221; with the one and only <strong>Chaka Khan. </strong>Unfortunately, Chaka&#8217;s wardrobe people apparently hate her guts and wish ill upon her, too, because her outfit was also HI-DE-OUS! First of all, it was brown. So automatically, she looked like a large UPS woman. Second, it was MUCH too tight on her, and you could literally count the rolls going down starting at her tummy and continuing down into the rear area. Lastly, this was yet another one-piece, awful, catsuit-looking . . . thing . . . which made her look like a ginormous potato sack with enormous breasts and hair. Not a good look. The singing? It was okay I guess. I was too distracted by the outfit to notice. (On a personal note, I am not a thin woman. I am overweight. So I am NOT making fun of these women&#8217;s bodies. I am simply questioning why on earth anyone would choose these outfits to wear in public, when they are obviously NOT flattering in any way whatsoever. The people whose job it is to be making these ladies look GOOD on television need to be fired. Immediately.)</p>
<p>*What better way to highlight what I&#8217;ve been saying all season long &#8211; that Skylar Laine looks like a mini-version of Reba McEntire&#8217;s long-lost daughter &#8211; than to have them sing a duet together? Watching <strong>Reba </strong>squint up the sides of her mouth alongside Skylar and her yelling/singing was quite humorous actually. Okay, most of my readers know Im not a country fan, but I&#8217;ll admit to smiling and enjoying their performance of &#8220;Turn Up the Radio.&#8221; If it&#8217;s a choice between hearing Skylar scream it alone, or hearing her sing it with Reba, I&#8217;ll go with the duet every time. Nice moment.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78671" title="Jessica Sanchez" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Jessica-Sanchez1-147x300.jpg" alt="" width="147" height="300" />*Jessica Sanchez performing &#8220;I Will Always Love You&#8221; was a beautiful moment also, although I was half expecting her to yell out mid-song &#8220;Ladies and gentlemen . . . please welcome . . . Whitney Houston!&#8221; Either that or I thought she might end up singing with a hologram. Too soon?</p>
<p>*The Top 5 men performed a rather chaotic, not pleasant-sounding medley of &#8220;America,&#8221; &#8220;Cracklin Rose,&#8221; and &#8220;I&#8217;m A Believer.&#8221;  During this monstrosity, my ears found out that one of the worst sounds on earth is the combination of Heejun Han and Colton Dixon singing together. Please never do that again. This medley went from weird to just bad when <strong>Neil Diamond </strong>was introduced into the performance, aimlessly wandering down the staircase and shouting the lyrics to &#8220;Sweet Caroline&#8221; more than actually singing them. I don&#8217;t know. He&#8217;s the man, but not so much anymore. I think he&#8217;s sort of losing his touch with the singing. As in, he didn&#8217;t do much of it. He also has this creepy vibe to him, like that strange uncle or family friend who hangs around a lot and drinks too much, and everyone wonders what their deal is. That&#8217;s Neil Diamond.</p>
<p>*The show added a tad of comedy to the finale by mocking Randy Jackson for always saying so -and -so can &#8220;sing the phone book and it would sound amazing!&#8221; So, some of the cast sang the phone book, in an entertaining sketch which had them set up like a choir, each holding phone books open, and singing phone numbers, names, and company descriptions in beautiful harmony and melody. It was pretty funny.</p>
<p>*Jennifer Lopez did a medley of her hits &#8220;Goin In&#8221; and &#8220;Follow the Leader,&#8221; which involved a lot of dancing more so than anything. Gotta say though, she is quite the performer. Entertaining. Although I&#8217;m not quite sure the sequined pants was the best choice in outfit for that last number.  She looked like she was wearing a diaper.  Also, some lunatic in the audience kept screaming &#8220;WOOO HOOO!!!!&#8221; every time Jennifer did anything. It was probably that loser Marc Anthony, looking for some more attention on the show.</p>
<p>*The duet of &#8220;You&#8217;ll Never Walk Alone&#8221; by past winner <strong>Jordan Sparks </strong>and Hollie Cavanagh was so unmemorable, I&#8217;m not even going to mention it. Well, okay. I just did mention it. But now I&#8217;m done mentioning it. There. The end.</p>
<p>*To honor the passing of Robyn Gibb of the Bee Gees Robyn Gibb, the top 5 men sat on stools and butchered some of his music. So that was nice of them. If anything, their elementary, sometimes just BAD harmonies further proved how difficult it was to do what the Bee Gees did so successfully for years. The men painfully blended their voices on &#8220;How Deep Is Your Love&#8221; (not good), &#8220;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&#8221; (questionable), and &#8220;To Love Somebody&#8221; (this was the best one, because Joshua saved it).</p>
<p>*The performance of the night came in the form of a duet by two powerhouse women. Well, one woman and one 16 year old. Singing the incredible Broadway song &#8220;And I Am Telling You (I Am Not Going),&#8221; Jessica Sanchez and the legendary original crooner <strong>Jennifer Holiday </strong>took turns killing each note and each moment and owning every single powerful second. It was also nice to see that with all the hype and attention and media Jennifer Hudson has gotten for this song, that the show and America finally got to see the true original and the real reason this song is great. At times during the duet, Holiday looked like she wanted to eat Sanchez with every note she growled. If you want to see someone who knows how to put <em>every part of themselves into a performance, </em>watch this woman. Sanchez was fantastic as well, and it was almost like watching Holiday sing with maybe a younger version of herself in some ways. It was astounding, and it brought down the house.</p>
<p>*Bringing down the house in a completely different way entirely was the reunion performance of <strong>Aerosmith, </strong>who were introduced by Seacrest, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been waiting all year to say this . . . ladies and gentlemen . . . give it up for Aerosmith!&#8221; Steven Tyler has still got it, folks (even though he also had the weirdest pants ever. Were they crotchless pants? I&#8217;m not sure, but there was a brown-like patch in the center that seemed to highlight his member. Very strange). Seeing Tyler and Joe Perry together again and smiling was really, really cool. Singing a song that was first written almost 21 years ago but is being released now, &#8220;Legendary Child,&#8221; along with the always fun &#8220;Walk This Way,&#8221; the band looked and sounded tight, free, and rock and roll! It was a nice kick-off to their upcoming tour.</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78660" title="Phil Phillips and Jessica Sanchez" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Phil-Phillips-and-Jessica-Sanchez-257x300.jpg" alt="" width="257" height="300" />*Last up was a lovely duet by the two finalists Phillip and Jessica, &#8220;Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong.&#8221; It was a sweet moment, and one that showed off their friendship.</p>
<p>*Two ex- Idol contestants who I honestly do not remember ever seeing in my lifetime, got engaged on the Finale. Diana DeGarmo and Ace Young. Good ole Ace asked Diana to marry him in the aisles of the audience as Seacrest looked on. She said yes. People cheered. I went and got a snack.</p>
<p>FINALLY . . . after all the trainwreck outfits and weird performances and all other time-wasting activities, the winner was announced. Let&#8217;s do this together. Just like old times.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dim the lights &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. here we go &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>After the nationwide vote, and the biggest voting numbers EVER on our show, the winner of season 11 <em>American Idol </em>is &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>PHILLIP PHILLIPS!!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>And with that, Phillip looked stunned as Seacrest handed him his guitar to sing his new hit song &#8220;Home.&#8221; (Not sure why he was surprised. Doesn&#8217;t he know that friendly looking white guys always win this show?) As Phillip started to sing, and the confetti started to fall . .. he finally realized what had just happened, and how his life had just changed. And then he cried. And he cried some more. And he stopped singing. And as the confetti fell, Phillip did what he has done throughout this whole season . .. he was himself. He ran off the stage and into the arms of his family, and just let the emotions happen. I love this guy. Now will you <em>please </em>go to the damn ER and get your freakin&#8217; kidney stone removed already? GO!!! We will wait. Take care of your health, Phil. America will be here waiting to buy your first album. Me? I&#8217;m still looking into the legalities of adopting a 21 year old singer with eyes that sparkle and a bad kidney. I still wanna put you in my pocket and take you home. Get it? &#8220;Home?&#8221; That&#8217;s your song, kid. I will be anxiously awaiting for you to come home.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BagIt_Fizzy_KeyArt.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-78641" title="BagIt_Fizzy_KeyArt" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BagIt_Fizzy_KeyArt.png" alt="" width="536" height="198" /></a></p>
<p>A mere two months ago, while searching for the next intriguing game app to review for our hungry Poptimal audience, a recommendation came my way for a delightful little game called <em>Bag It!</em> The strategy based app, which manages to utilize both physics and imagination while focusing on the seemingly ordinary task of <em>carefully</em> bagging one’s own groceries, quickly gained a hefty following in the Android and iOS worlds. With engaging gameplay and cleverly personified food-based characters, the popularity only grew and the minds behind the hit at Hidden Variable Studios quickly realized that the story of <em>Bag It!</em> was not yet quite complete.</p>
<p>Those familiar with <em>Bag It!</em> will already know all about the game’s most endearing characters, like the mighty Spilt and a sensitive Sir Eggward, as well as the various grocery aisles, or stages, they can peruse such as “Udder Mayhem”, “Ultimate Bagger”, and the stress-relieving favorite, “Endless Rampage”. Always open to expanding upon a great thing, the <em>Bag It!</em> development team recently announced the plan to release a new, shiny updated version of the game on May 25th. Here at Poptimal, we were fortunate enough to get the insider details from Hidden Variable Studios’ own co-founder, David Marino, who filled us in on the upcoming release, how paying attention to life’s simple details is key, and a bit about the newest member to the <em>Bag It!</em> cast, Fizzy.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; text-align: center;" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Dn5Y4B5P6iM" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First off, can you tell us a little bit about who Hidden Variable Studios are as a company?</strong><br />
We believe that there is a ‘Hidden Variable’ to be found in everything all around us – it refers to the things that we may not recognize exist but bring us joy upon discovering them. When my two partners and I co-founded the company, we wanted that to be our mission, to bring out the fun and fantastic in the world around us. We feel that there is a lot of exciting aspects to life that people don’t notice in their daily lives, and our job as creators and entertainers is to illuminate as many of those possibilities as we can.</p>
<p><strong>What was the primary inspiration for <em>Bag It!</em> and how did the idea for its characters materialize?</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Like our company, <em>Bag It!</em> was created to show players a whole new amazing world inside something as mundane and “everyday” as a grocery bag. As with most creative efforts, it evolved in a series of steps. We wanted to take the familiar elements of grocery bagging &#8212; size, weight, fragility &#8212; and turn that into a compelling, rewarding, and accessible experience. Anyone who has ever bagged their own groceries knows there’s a bit of inherent strategy in performing that simple act, so using that core concept as a base, we expanded on it to bring an entire world to life.</p>
<p>The characters were actually a new idea that sprung up early in development. Whenever we are exploring new ideas, we have a very open and creative environment. Our senior artist just happened to be doodling, putting little faces and expressions on the groceries, and when he showed it to us, it immediately struck us as a natural fit. Companies already try to personify their groceries with marketing and branding, so people already see little bits of personality when they pick up a box of cereal or a bag of chips. Turning the groceries into characters seemed like the ideal extension of that concept, and it immediately gave us ideas on how those characters and their expressions could reinforce gameplay.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BagIt_Screenshot_iphone_5.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78647" title="BagIt_Screenshot_iphone_5" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BagIt_Screenshot_iphone_5-200x300.png" alt="" width="200" height="300" /></a>What are the newest and most important features fans can look forward to from the <em>Bag It!</em> update?</strong></p>
<p>The number one request we get from our <em>Bag It!</em> fans is new levels, and we’re happy to say that this new update has a whole bunch of them. In fact, we introduce 16 new levels in a mix of all the different modes, from the original ‘Classic’ to the cathartic ‘Rampage’. We also added over 25 achievements built on our own internal achievement system, so no matter what device you are playing on, or how much of a <em>Bag It!</em> pro you already are, there’s a new set of goals that you can set out to achieve.</p>
<p>In addition to those two major updates, we are also introducing our newest character, Fizzy, a nervous soda bottle with an explosive personality. It’s our most ambitious character yet, and he has unique mechanics that we really hope makes the player think about how they are packing him into their grocery bag. Finally, we revamped all of our ‘Endless’ modes to make them more satisfying and engaging. All in all, we feel that this update is going to bring hours and hours of new gameplay to our fans.</p>
<p><strong>What does Hidden Variable Studios foresee for the future of the company? Will there be more <em>Bag It!</em> updates or entirely new game apps altogether? And are you perhaps thinking of one day expanding beyond the smartphone platforms?</strong></p>
<p>We would definitely love to continue supporting <em>Bag It!,</em> and we have no shortage of ideas for new characters and mechanics that we would love to bring to life. If people keep playing it, we’ll keep making it! As for the future of the company, we have just started work on fleshing out and prototyping some exciting new ideas for our second game. We are always looking for inspiration from the world around us, and our team is very excited to begin work on the next project.</p>
<p>We come from a PC and console background, so we are always looking for ways to increase the reach of our games and get them into as many hands as possible. While we have been thrilled with the smartphone and tablet markets, we would definitely be interested in expanding our influence into browser based, Facebook, and handheld devices.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any final thoughts that you&#8217;d think fans and readers should know about Hidden Variable Studios, Fizzy or the rest of the <em>Bag It!</em> family?</strong></p>
<p>We are really committed as a company to providing a great experience for as many of our customers as possible. Your opinions and feedback are of paramount importance to us, hence why we added buttons throughout the game itself that let them send e-mails directly to us. If you like or dislike something, let us know! We read everything that gets sent our way, and we are constantly figuring out ways to improve our games.</p>
<p>Finally, we just want to thank everyone who has supported us over the last year. Knowing that people are having a great time with our game is one of the most rewarding aspects of being a game developer. The more directly we can communicate with our fans and understand their wants and needs, the better our games will ultimately be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The updated Bag It! app will be available on Friday, May 25<sup>th</sup> and for a limited time can be purchased for the sale price of $0.99 on your Android, iOS, Kindle Fire, and NOOK Color devices.</em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MV5BNzYyNDc0MzI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEwMzQ1Nw@@._V1._SX640_SY348_.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78631" title="MV5BNzYyNDc0MzI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEwMzQ1Nw@@._V1._SX640_SY348_" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MV5BNzYyNDc0MzI1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDEwMzQ1Nw@@._V1._SX640_SY348_-300x163.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="163" /></a>I think I could easily argue that no other filmmaker working today has a style as instantly recognizable as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0027572/">Wes Anderson</a>&#8216;s. I think even the most casual film-goer could glance at a couple frames from his latest film and be able to say, &#8220;Hey, this must be from the dude that made <em>The Royal Tenenbaums </em>and <em>The Life Aquatic!</em>&#8221; His latest film<em></em> retains that familiar style and while some people may initially find that tiresome (as I did with <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em>) I found it more akin to crawling under a favorite, warm blanket because <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748122/"><em>Moonrise Kingdom</em></a> is easily the most pleasantly endearing film of the year thus far.</p>
<p>Set on a small island off the coast of New England, <em>Moonrise Kingdom </em>tells the story of two socially outcast youngsters falling for each other and running off together to start a new life. But what sounds like a relatively simple case of naive teens running away turns into an event that flips the community upside down with parents being torn apart and boy scouts getting stabbed with lefty scissors in the midst of a record-breaking rain storm.</p>
<p>As with any Anderson film the cast is a veritable who&#8217;s who of Hollywood greats including <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195/">Bill Murray</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000531/">Edward Norton</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001570/">Francis McDormand</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000246/">Bruce Willis</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0842770/">Tilda Swinton</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000172/">Harvey Keitel</a> but the real standouts here are the two newcomers who play the film&#8217;s young lovers: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4442068/">Jared Gilman</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4442319/">Kara Hayward</a>. As Sam and Suzy, Gilman and Hayward prove themselves to be talents to watch with performances that are both quirky and lovable, but above all rich with emotion and feeling. Their motives and devotion to each other are never unclear or unbelievable. In fact, if the events around them didn&#8217;t take on such a madcap frenzy one could almost believe that this chronicle of their love for each other was a sort of bizarre documentary. They are just that good.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I found myself disappointed with Anderson&#8217;s last live action film, <em>The Darjeeling Limited</em> for reasons that just felt tired but he completely redeemed himself for me with his stop-motion masterpiece <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox.</em> And thinking of <em>Fox</em> in conjunction with this latest work makes me wonder if the key to Anderson&#8217;s success is children. Even though I could easily consider him to be one of the most mature filmmakers working today, I think there is something inherently childlike about his style that becomes almost magical when paired with stories that either include children or are tailored for them.</p>
<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MV5BMTM3MjMzMzgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQyNzA4Nw@@._V1._SX640_SY348_.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78630" title="MV5BMTM3MjMzMzgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQyNzA4Nw@@._V1._SX640_SY348_" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MV5BMTM3MjMzMzgyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQyNzA4Nw@@._V1._SX640_SY348_-300x163.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="163" /></a>In addition to the fantastic performances from the two young lovers Anderson populates the film with young characters such as Suzy&#8217;s three adorable little brothers who spend their days listening to records that break down orchestral compositions as well as Troop 55 of the Khaki Scouts who are assigned by their hapless Scout Master Ward (Norton) to hunt down Sam when he escapes from the troop&#8217;s camp. What I love most about the troop is how ridiculously believable they are. These aren&#8217;t kids who seem to be acting. Instead, they appear to be your average everyday pre-teen boys just living life with all of the billowing testosterone and quirks that you&#8217;d expect to encounter in real life kids of this age group. That&#8217;s rarely captured on film and for that, Anderson should be commended.</p>
<p>But its not just the realistic child performances that <em>Moonrise Kingdom </em>has to boast about. Throughout the twists and turns of the story we ultimately get to witness a perfectly rendered portrayal of the odd lengths people go to for their first love. Sure, not all of us convinced our first love to run away from home to trek through the wilderness and set up camp on a secluded beach, but I&#8217;m sure we can all relate to wanting to do anything and everything with that person no matter how silly or unrealistic it may be in retrospect. I, for one, am guilty of that but have never seen it portrayed on film before in such a humorous but delicate way. For that reason alone this film is a gem.</p>
<p>This definitely isn&#8217;t the kind of movie that you think of being released during the wild summer months. There are no aliens, no big explosions, and no Happy Meal toys, but it is a beautifully shot, wonderfully written, and perfectly pleasant way to spend two hours of your life. And honestly, what more do you need to know? Just go see it. You can thank me later.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78620" title="322Gle_322-Sc20_0254" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/322Gle_322-Sc20_0254-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="207" />This week’s <em><a href="http://www.fox.com/glee/">Glee</a> </em>wasn’t just about saying goodbye to the show for the summer; it was also about teachers saying farewell to their students and the graduating class saying goodbye to the underclassmen and vice versa.  (Though the young ones kind of bailed out and only sang to Finn.) Basically, everyone was just loving on everyone, but mostly the episode gave closure to some lingering questions and set up the futures of those we’ve grown to care about over the past three years.</p>
<p>Schue gave his last lesson of the season by asking the seniors to sing a song to say goodbye to those they’d leave behind, while the youngins’ sang songs to those who’ll be missed. It was kind of the perfect lesson for once and completely made sense. Plus, it gave Mr. Schue the opportunity to give his own sendoff to his kids. (I wonder if Will and Emma will become more central characters again next season?) But the biggest goodbye of all definitely shocked me. More on that later.</p>
<p>The seniors each got their voiceover to reminisce how much they’d grown and changed over the past three seasons and a chance to express how they really feel about moving on. So let’s take a stroll down “Where Are They Now” lane.</p>
<p><strong>The McKinley Graduating Class of 2012</strong><br />
<strong>Mike Chang</strong> turned down an acceptance to Alvin Ailey for Chicago’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joffrey_Ballet">Joffrey Ballet</a>’s Academy of Dance.</p>
<p><strong>Mercedes Jones</strong> got the smallest goodbye of all the original cast members. It was a little strange and sad for a character and actress that gave some of <em>Glee</em>’s best musical performances, but at least she received a happy ending. After Sam posted that YouTube clip of her killing “Disco Inferno,” an LA label now wants to sign her. She sweetly let him know that she couldn’t have done it without him, but their fairly stealthy relationship has probably seen its last days.</p>
<p><strong>Noah Puckerman</strong>’s big question was would the school rebel-turned-semi-softie graduate. Beiste helped him prepare for his big test, but his confidence just wasn’t there, and he’d resigned to repeating senior year for all eternity. But Quinn, admitting to Puck that she still loved him and that he was her first and all they’ve been through forever bonded them, boosted his confidence with some kisses and kind words about embracing the guy he used to be. It must have been exactly what he needed because he walked into school the next day like he owned the place, and later got to don a cap and gown. It’s still unknown whether he’ll go out to LA and start his pool cleaning business.</p>
<p><strong>Santana Lopez</strong> congratulated all her friends as they received good news, but getting a scholarship to the University of Louisville just doesn’t feel like going after her dreams and it started to eat away at her. Her mother (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002065/">Gloria Estefan</a> finally!) has supported her through coming out, and she trusts her opinion on whether or not she should pursue her passion or attend college. At first, Maribel tells her to get a degree and put her dreams on hold, but Santana makes up her mind. If she can’t go to New York, then she’ll stay in Lima with Brittany who, of course, is not graduating with her 0.0 grade point average. In the end, Maribel told her to take the money she’d saved for her education and to go after what she wants because she trusts her. Again, where Santana may go and her relationship with Brittany is left up in the air as to what could happen next.</p>
<p><strong>Quinn Fabray</strong> is definitely the <em>Glee </em>1.0 character who’s come the farthest outside of Finn and Rachel. Her transition was perfectly mirrored by Sue, who’s still a mean hag, but has exposed her heart so much more to those who really support her. When Quinn attempted to return her honorary Cheerios uniform and Sue forced her to keep it, it’s pretty sweet to see the two Queen Bees breakdown, and Sue even admitted that the girl she once believed she saw a little bit of herself in was actually so much better than her, the biggest compliment an ego maniac can give. But even sweeter was when Quinn gifted Rachel with a train pass from New Haven (where Yale is) to New York (where NYADA can be found) so that the two enemies-turned-frenemies-turned-true friends would actually stay in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Kurt Hummel</strong>’s goodbye wasn’t all about Blaine, and it shouldn’t have been. The two openly shared their commitment to each other, while acknowledging that long distance relationships are hard. Short and sweet. For me, the relationship that really epitomizes Kurt’s time on the show is his relationship with his father Burt. It’s a special and memorable TV relationship and one that continues to bring joy to me. I hope we don’t see the last of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005282/">Mike O’Malley</a>. Kurt realized that what he’s gone through might have paved the way for future gay students to openly express themselves at McKinley, and that’s all good and well, but no sentiment can match Burt’s graduation present, a recreation of the “Single Ladies” dance with Tina and Brittany, which represented to Burt the turning point in his relationship with Kurt. So classic.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78621" title="322GLEE_Ep322-Sc40_045" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/322GLEE_Ep322-Sc40_045-300x207.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="207" />Saying goodbye was certainly hardest for <strong>Finn Hudson</strong> and <strong>Rachel Berry</strong>. The couple, including Kurt, decided to open their acceptance letters together, but Rachel is the only one who receives good news. With the wedding still on, she planned to stay with them in Lima and help them reapply, deferring her acceptance to NYADA for a year, but Finn had other plans. He struggled with the idea of making his father proud and not being able to get the Army to change his discharge to an honorable one, so on their way to the wedding, he takes her to the train station and tells her that he has to set her free and won’t be what holds her back from her dreams. He even joined the Army. It was heartbreaking to watch Rachel cry because the two obviously love each other, but he did the right thing. If they are meant to be together, they will be in time, after they’ve both focused on themselves and their futures. At the station, all their friends are waiting to send her off, giving her strength to walk away.</p>
<p>We were left with the final image of Rachel exiting Grand Central and walking the city streets alone, but with endless possibilities in front of her…in front of all of them, really.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine <em>Glee </em>without any of these folks, and I’m still not sure how the <em>Glee </em>club will stack up next year, finding new leads and star voices. Will recurring characters like Sam, Sugar, Rory and Joe stick around? Will everyone get back together for Will and Emma’s wedding? Who will be left in Lima when we return and who’ll have moved on? The finale left all of these opportunities wide open and left us with some amazing final songs. It certainly could have been a fantastic series finale had they not picked up a renewal. Most importantly, it left me gleeful and excited for next season.</p>
<p>And now I’ll leave you with some words from one of the most classic graduation songs <em>ever</em> recorded by the lovely Vitamin C.  How could they have not covered a song so full of emotion and so overtly titled?</p>
<p><em>Will we think about tomorrow like we think about now?</em><br />
<em> Can we survive it out there?</em><br />
<em> Can we make it somehow?</em><br />
<em> I guess I thought that this would never end</em><br />
<em> And suddenly it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re women and men</em><br />
<em> Will the past be a shadow that will follow us &#8217;round?</em><br />
<em> Will these memories fade when I leave this town?</em><br />
<em> I keep, keep thinking that it&#8217;s not goodbye</em><br />
<em> Keep on thinking it&#8217;s a time to fly</em></p>

<p><strong>Memorable Moments</strong></p>

<li>A reprise of “Sit Down, You’re Rockin’ the Boat.”</li>
<li>“We can use the waste basket for the toilet. And then we could eat Joe for the food since she’s been here the shortest, so we know her the least.” – Brittany</li>
<li>A whole lot of flashbacks (see above, Schue discovering Finn in the shower, the “Single Ladies” number)</li>
<li>“Not a bad legacy for someone who once pretended to be in lust with Rachel Berry, so he wouldn&#8217;t have to date Mercedes Jones. ” – Kurt</li>
<li>“We know how hard relationships can be — we both saw <em>The Notebook</em>.” –Blaine</li>
<li>James Lipton auditioning Finn for his Pace admission.</li>
<li>Schue admitting he couldn’t sign more than a generic message in Finn’s yearbook because every time he started, he just couldn’t hold it together.</li>
<li>Schue admitting to Finn that he planted pot in his locker to blackmail him into joining the glee club, and Finn returning, “You are so much cooler than I ever thought you were.”</li>
<li>“That’s quite an accomplishment for a pregnant woman whose ass is so old, she went to high school with Moses.” – Coach Roz</li>
<li>“You just be sure to bottle-feed, because that baby’s gonna use those sharp-ass teeth to bite.” – Coach Roz</li>
<li>Quinn: I’m going to miss you so much.<br />
Sue: I don’t see how that’s possible, but thank you.</li>
<li>Puck’s final C-. “That’s a Puckerman A+!” – Puck</li>
<li>A completely outrageous graduation ceremony. If I remember mine correctly we sang a very ironic but completely classical “Hallelujah”.</li>
</ul>

		<description><![CDATA[I will miss you Tommy. Until next time, which will, of course, be in about 2.5 months.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78592" title="DWTS 3" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DWTS-32-215x300.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="300" />It&#8217;s that time of the season where spring has sprung, the weather is warmer, and another season of <em>Dancing With the Stars </em>has come to an end. I know that everyone is sad, and rightly so, but please don&#8217;t fret! This show returns more often than Lindsey Lohan to rehab. This show is on TV more times per year than the local nightly news. This show comes back from retirement more times than Barbara Streisand. My point is this . . . the show ain&#8217;t going anywhere! Tom and Brooke and the whole crazy gang of hilarious judges will all be back to hock that awful Mirrorball Trophy that is apparently filled with crack and methadone and $4 million dollars. Why else would everyone want that thing so badly? It&#8217;s something only Tommy B. knows, and for you to find out, you have to become a mediocre star, go on the show, dance your face off, and win the damn thing. Get to it!</p>
<p>In any case, we have come to the end. The Finals, and the great big Finale Event. The three that remain dancing are, of course, Donald and Peta, Katherine and Mark, and William and Cheryl. Each couple would dance two times. The first round is Judges&#8217; Choice (a new routine to a style of dance the judges feel the couple needs improvement on), and the second round is the ever-popular, amazing, never disappointing Freestyle Dance where anything goes. During the finale episode, each couple had one final dance for judges&#8217; votes only, but everybody knows that dance is pointless, since America has already voted at that point and I don&#8217;t believe for a second that last dance affects ANYTHING. I ain&#8217;t no fool!</p>
<p><strong>William / Cheryl:</strong></p>
<p>Judges&#8217; Choice was the Cha-cha, and the couple got the help of Bruno Tonioli and his insanity. During rehearsal footage, he told William that he is &#8220;sex on legs&#8221; and I suppose he gave him some actual dancing tips in between the lusting. Their dance was sexy as hell; hip action and Will had the open shirt. What could be better than that really? Len said it was &#8220;loud and proud, and that was just your shirt!&#8221; (Okay Len. That joke bombed. You need to stop getting your material for jokes from the nursing home cafeteria ladies.) Bruno stood up and yelled: &#8220;It was intoxicating! Like a human COCK(pause, pause, pause)tale on the dance floor!&#8221; Right Bruno. You just wanted to say the word cock. Genius. The pair received a perfect score of 10/10/10.</p>
<p>Next up was the Freestyle and it was hot, fiery, Latin, and filled with lifts. It was exactly what we would expect from the talented William and more! However, cranky Len disagreed. &#8220;Too predictable! All you do is show your bum and shake it. I&#8217;m fed up with it!&#8221; to which Tom Bergeron observed, &#8220;I think that Len is suffering from bum envy.&#8221; Bruno thought it was sinful, and a &#8220;Latin-inspired extravaganza!&#8221; while Carrie Ann said the dance was &#8220;breaking new ground!&#8221; Len shot back, &#8220;What new ground? It was the same ole thing!&#8221; As Len continued to be cranky and ask for his prune juice, the judges kept arguing and scores were 10/9/10.</p>
<p><strong>Katherine / Mark:</strong></p>
<p>In the first round, the couple did a Pasa Doble with the help of judge Len Goodman, who assisted Katherine with her technical movements in the dance, or as Len says, the &#8220;duuuuuuuuunce.&#8221; The result was a gorgeous, flowing routine that made Katherine look &#8220;like a ballerina&#8221; (according to Carrie Ann), and was filled with &#8220;technical brilliance&#8221; (Bruno). Len enjoyed the &#8220;tasty tidbits&#8221; in his pants . . . I mean . . . in the duuuuuuunce. The pair received a perfect score of 10/10/10 and were happier than pie.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-78591" title="DWTS 2" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DWTS-21-300x227.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="227" />The Freestyle round brought forth one of my VERY favorite dances of the season, if not my favorite ever! I just looooove this style of music (swing), loved the song (Fosse&#8217;s &#8220;Sing, Sing, Sing&#8221; with Katherine herself singing the first few lines beautifully) and love the complicated, quick movements involved. Simply incredible. I could watch this again and again. Bruno called it a &#8221;flamboyant tour de force, so much content, on the money!&#8221; Carrie Ann cheered, &#8220;this showed you off like a Champion!&#8221; and Len yelled, &#8220;Now THAT was a freestyle!&#8221; Another perfect 10/10/10 score.</p>
<p><strong>Donald / Heavens to Peta Mergatroyd:</strong></p>
<p>Judges&#8217; choice was an Argentine Tango, with the help of judge Carrie Ann Inaba, who advised the pair to put more content into their routine to get that 10 score from Len. The dance was sharp, smooth, and very suave. But guess what? Len still didn&#8217;t hand out that 10 to Donald. When he said he found the dance to be &#8220;a bit careful&#8221; Tommy B. retorted: &#8220;He is really starting to annoy me.&#8221; Funny stuff. Backstage, scores were 10/9/10 and Donald promised that he would finally get that 10 from Len in the Freestyle dance.</p>
<p>For the Freestyle round, Donald and Peta did something that nobody would ever see coming from them . . . a country and western line-dance using Cowboy Troy. It was awesome! Tons of complicated, dangerous lifts! Incredible footwork! Carrie Ann called it her favorite dance of the night, Bruno commented that he can never resist the wild, wild west, and Len said something about how in football, catches equal matches. Matches? I think that&#8217;s tennis, you dope. Anyway, they loved it, and Donald FINALLY got his 10 from Len, on the last day of the season. Perfect score of 10/10/10.</p>
<p>The second night of the show was the &#8220;Finale Extravaganza&#8221;, where all the ex-stars come back out to play, and where they try to waste 2 hours of TV time with anything and everything, and then cram the Winner of the show into the last .16 seconds of airing. Each of the three couples also danced one more time for judges&#8217; scores, but everyone knows that dance meant nothing.</p>
<p>Kelly Clarkson performed a medley of two of her big hits off her current album, and of course, promoted her upcoming new show to air Thursday night, <em>Duets. </em>When Kelly asked Tom Bergeron if he would like to do a duet with her on the show, he made a joke about how that would ruin the show immediately, but what Tommy B. doesnt understand is that THIS is what America wants to see. We want to see Tom and Brooke doing a Pasa Doble for scores. Or Tom and Kelly Clarkson butchering through a duet. Or Tom and Bruno getting freaky with a Jive. Any of that would be so much fun.</p>
<p>The cast of stars were all back in their glory for a final shining moment onstage. Sherri danced with Val and a whole slew of male pro-dancers to &#8220;It&#8217;s Raining Men&#8221; while the robotic twins Martina and Wagner both got their wooden steps in during a foursome dance. Jack still looked like David Bowie, and Martina is still a tennis legend and not a dancer. Gladys and Man Ass got their moment in the sun as well, and the show finally did what they should have done months ago, and had Gladys Knight do what she does best . . . SING! (duh!) She did a beautiful rendition of &#8220;The Way We Were&#8221; and the Empress of Soul was so moving, she actually moved herself to tears.</p>
<p>There were more dances, video montages, people crying, lots of people talking about how great other people are on the show, and then the Final 3 went down to the Final 2. With this group of 3 very talented and deserving dancers, it really could have been anyone. But it was William and Cheryl who took 3rd place, leaving Donald and Peta and Katherine and Mark as the Final Two.</p>
<p>And in those final seconds of the show, just before credits start to roll, they finally decide to tell us the winner. &#8220;And the winner . . . of season 12 of Dancing with the Stars and the MirrorBall Trophy . . . is . . .</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-78589" title="DWTS 1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DWTS-11-199x300.jpg" alt="" width="199" height="300" />DONALD AND PETA!!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yup. Who saw that coming? Maybe some did, but I thought it would be Katherine. However, I gotta say I have NEVER seen anyone on this show as excited as Donald was to win that cheesy, dumb trophy. He fell on the floor, he cried, he pumped his fists in the air, and he declared it as exciting as winning The Superbowl. Seriously &#8211; <em>what is that trophy made of??? </em>Tom Bergeron had a funny line when he went over to Donald and said, &#8220;Well, I have to ask you the question that Brooke always asks, How does it feel?&#8221; (Oh Tommy B., you know and I know that you know that I know that you know she asks that question so much becuase you read my reviews . . . I am your silent hero. I&#8217;m like a ghost-writer on the show with these reviews. I feel its time they start paying me now, or at least invite me to come sit in the damn audience already. I wanna meet Tommy B!) So, in the end, Heavens to Peta Mergatroyd gets her very first win as a pro-dancer, and yet another football player comes from behind to take the Trophy!!!!</p>
<p>Great season. Great dancers. Great cast. I don&#8217;t know how they are going to beat this one. My suggestion would be to go back to the &#8220;freak&#8221; route. Bring back the freaks!!! I will even give you a few ideas. How about Octo-mom? Talk about hilarious! Tony Danza! He claims to be a dancer in real life. I think he taps or something. Let&#8217;s see how good he is! Regis! How about The Fonz? He could punch a jukebox to begin every dance routine. You need someone older than dirt and funny. Don Rickles! Let&#8217;s see Rickles do the Argentine Tango without croaking! There are always so many injuries on the show, and that damn ambulance is on standby. Next season, we need a death. Someone needs to die . . . LLLLIIIIVEEEEEEE!!!!!!!</p>
<p>I will miss you Tommy. Until next time, which will, of course, be in about 2.5 months.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[This week’s episode of Girls was absolutely charming.  There was a change in scenery with Hannah going back to Michigan to see her parents, and I have to say, it was refreshing!]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Girls-S1E6_1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-78572" title="Girls S1E6_1" src="http://poptimal.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Girls-S1E6_1.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="291" /></a>This week’s episode of <em>Girls </em>was absolutely charming.  There was a change in scenery with Hannah going back to Michigan to see her parents, and I have to say, it was refreshing!</p>
<p>Hannah returns to her hometown of Lansing to spend some time with their parents during their anniversary, but it’s not long before she starts getting annoyed with them, especially because her mom keeps dropping hints about job opportunities in Michigan that Hannah should look in to.  She doesn’t want to tell them she lost her job last week, even though Marnie needs the rent ASAP.</p>
<p>When her mom starts having bad hot flashes, Hannah is asked to make a run to the pharmacy. Instead of hurrying like her mom asks, she stops in to visit a friend, Heather, from high school.  Heather informs Hannah that a girl they knew from high school recently disappeared, and there will be a benefit to raise money for her parents that night.  Heather also tells Hannah she’s moving to LA to be a dancer.</p>
<p>When she finally hits the pharmacy for her mom, Hannah gets asked out by the cute pharmacist’s son.  He asks her to go to the benefit with him, and she agrees, even though her parents were hoping to spend the evening with her.  Hannah gives herself an adorable, “You are from New York, therefore you are just naturally interesting,” pep talk before going out with Eric, the guy from the pharmacy.</p>
<p>At the benefit, Hannah is horrified to see Heather’s dance routine, which is . . . not good. Hannah starts to get upset, knowing how much Heather will struggle in LA.  She starts to realize that she and Heather aren’t so different – she’s a writer, not making any money.  She leaves the benefit with Eric and they go back to his place, where they have somewhat awkward sex (is she capable of anything but awkward sex?).</p>
<p>On their anniversary dinner, Hannah’s parents talk about Hannah and whether or not they should have cut her off. Her mom seems to have faith in her, though her dad is worried about her.  Later, her parents go back home and end up having some shower sex. But her dad slips and falls and hits his head. When Hannah comes home, she finds her dad naked on the bathroom floor. He says it’s his back that hurts. Though mortified, she helps her mom take him to his bedroom.</p>
<p>Afterwards, she and her mom have a conversation, and her mother asks how she’s doing with money.  Hannah shows some real growth from the first episode, when she threw a fit, by not asking for money from her mother.  Instead, she pretends to be making it work.</p>
<p>Back in her bedroom, she gets a call from Adam. Is this the first time he’s actually called her?  Granted, he’s calling her back, but that still seems like an improvement.  At the start of the episode, she was adamant that he no longer existed (even though she called him), but they have an actually pretty nice talk. She tells him that she cares about him, and after what happened to Carrie, the girl who disappeared, she’s scared that if something happened to him, she’d never know.  He tells her he misses her (wow, that’s big for Adam). The episode ends with them still talking.  Despite being miles and miles apart, it seems like the closest they’ve ever been.</p>
<p>This was my favorite episode thus far. While I missed the other three girls (especially Shoshanna, whom I adore) it was really nice to see Hannah in a new environment and to see her parents again.  I think we saw a lot of growth from Hannah, which was much needed. It was very smart and well done.  Kudos to the <em>Girls </em>team!</p>
<p>Season 1, Episode 6: “The Return” (original air date May 20, 2012)</p>
<p><em>Girls</em> airs Sunday night at 10:30 p.m. on HBO.</p>
