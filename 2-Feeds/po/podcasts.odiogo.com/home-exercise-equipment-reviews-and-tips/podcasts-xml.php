&nbsp;lbs. for those looking for extra resistance when exercising. The gym has the capacity for over 50 strength and muscle building exercises. A built-in rowing station is included.<br />

<br />
<b>Adjustable Power Rods provide the resistance.</b> They have a number of advantages over weight plates used with land dumbbells.&nbsp; The resistance is more uniform across the exercise. The inertia that sometimes makes resistance uneven when using free weight is greatly diminished. The resistance is contained within the gym. You will not have weights cluttering up your workout space.<br />
<br />
Power Rods are made from a high-tech composite under quality control conditions. They are tested for quality and durability.<br />

<b>Other Features of the Bowflex PR3000 home gym.</b><br />
<ul>
<li>You can get in a complete, full body workout with the more than 50 exercises available from this single exercise platform. The exercises range from bench presses (standard, inclined, and declined) to leg exercises (squats, leg extensions, and hip abductors). You can see a more complete list of exercises <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AS4YRQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001AS4YRQ">here.</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001AS4YRQ" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />&nbsp;</li>
<li>The space required to workout is minimal. An area of 9 feet by 7 feet is more than enough space to host the PR3000 gym.&nbsp;</li>

<li>The no change cable pulley system is a great time saver. It also boosts your performance by moving from exercise to exercise more efficiently.</li>

<br />
<b>What the men and women who already have the Bowflex PR3000 have to say.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
The PR3000 home gym frm Bowflex has been around for a while. It's been around long enough to garner a fair sampling of positive and negative reviews online. The good news is most all the reviews we found were positive.<br />
<br />
 <br />
We found 50 ( so far ) reviews at Amazon. You can read them for yourself <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/B001AS4YRQ/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">here.</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> The overall combined rating was a very nice 4.4 stars out of a possible 5.0 star rating. The men and women who reviewed the PR3000 home gym mentioned that they liked the quick cable changes, the quietness of operation, and the fact that you can upgrade the resistance level .<br />
<br />
<i>Patti</i>, from Los Angeles, likes her Bowflex PR3000 home gym. She says it does everything she needs in a home gym. Even though Patti was originally in the market for a home gym using free weights, she eventually decided to go with the PR3000.<br />
<br />
She decide to go with this home gym over other mainly because it does not take up much floor space and also so she will not have to "move heavy weights around during my workout".<br />
<br />
Patti feels her new gym is very well made with attention paid to the details. She does wish it had a lat bar though. Overall, Patti, gave her new home gym a 4 star rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Tim</i>, from Indiana, says he is "really glad" he spent the extra money and got the PR3000 instead of the PR1000 home gym. He's already lost some of the weight he wants to get rid of. He highly recommends this gym and says he feels like he did after a workout at the local gym.<br />
<br />
<i>Lain</i> is a busy mom and this is her first home gym. Looking for a gym that did not take up much space and was easy to use, Lain settled on the PR3000. She is happy with her choice.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>"The Bowflex PR3000 is perfect for those wishes.  I use it almost 
everyday and feel I get a great work out.  The machine is very well made
 and sturdy, and so easy to put together.  The Bowflex products are 
expensive, but well worth the money.  This home gym is a great 
alternative when going to a public gym is inconvienient."
      </i></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i>Jason</i>, from Silicon Valley, was less satisfied. His beef is with the resistance. He feels the resistance is less than indicated and has upgraded but still has "maxed out on many exercises (like the bench press)". He says that is a shame because, "otherwise this is a really great machine."<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Clay</i> is 6'3" and calls the Bowflex PR3000, "a perfect machine for me even." The kickbacks were a little awkward for Clay at first but be quickly got used to them. He say he'll "definitely" be upgrading to 310 lbs. soon. The ability to upgrade the resistance and the no pulley change system are big pluses in Clay's book. The no change pulley system not only saves him time but also lets him concentrate on the workouts.<br />
<br />
The Bowflex PR3000 was a perfect home gym for Bob and his wife.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp;<i>"This machine is excellent. My wife and I have been using it for a month 
now and have seen an improvement in overall condition. We are both 
nearing 60 and wanted to do something to maintain our physical health. 
We have been very pleased.  It is very similar to the more expensive 
Xtreme® SE 2 home gym with the exception of the movable pulleys and 
small lat crunch bar.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
<i>I added the extra 100 lb. bow set and a pull down 
bar which I would recommend. The exercise illustrations are not as good 
or complete as those shown in the Xtreme manual. In fact you can follow 
most all of the exercises listed in the Xtreme SE2 manual." </i></blockquote>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AS4YRQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001AS4YRQ">Order the Bowflex PR3000 Home Gym from Amazon and Save.</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001AS4YRQ" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /><br />
<br />
We feel the Bowflex PR3000 is a well made, well thought out home gym that will meet the workout needs of many people. If you want to build your strength, tone up and tighten, or lose weight, this home gym will be an excellent tool to help you reach your goals.<br />
<br />
The main complaint we found was concerning the levels of resistance. Many people felt that the stated resistance levels were exaggerated. They felt the resistance was quite a bit less. So if you are planning on lifting heavy you'll probably want to either upgrade the resistance of choose another home gym.<br />
<br />
But overall is think this if a fine home gym that will meet the needs of most.&nbsp; <br />

<br />
<i>C.Bayne </i>calls her Bowflex PR1000 home gym,<b> "Great for the price."</b><br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>"I put this together myself, which is a pretty good workout in itself. 
(OK, my husband helped a bit, but I did 90% of it.) It's sturdy, but not
 rock solid.  It's fairly small for a work out machine, and the bench 
can fold up, so the footprint is about 4'x3'.  It's about 6 1/2 feet 
tall.  I'm 5'4" and it's tall enough for me.  My husband is 5'11" and 
this is just barely tall enough for him.  The bars "weight" is 105 lbs 
for each side, which might not be enough for a body builder, but it's 
good for us.  After a half hour work out, my muscles know I've been 
doing something.<br /><br />The booklet that comes with the machine has several exercises, but going out to the web will get you a lot more exercises.<br /><br />This
 is a very good exercise machine for the casual exerciser, as long as 
you're not too tall.  It's easy to use, it doesn't take up too much 
space, and it's not prohibitively expensive.  It's sturdy, and you can 
work out all your muscles"

<b>What Bowflex PR1000 users have to say about their home gyms.&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
;Bowflex PR1000 home gym has been around for several years. Finding out what the women and men who have already purchased and use this gym have to say is insightful and valuable if you are thinking of taking the plunge and buying one yourself.<br />
<br />
We found more than 100 customer reviews on the Bowflex PR1000 home gym at Amazon. These reviewers talked about everything from the time it took to assemble their home gym once it arrived to the sturdiness of the machine to the benefits they derived from using it.<br />
<br />
The overall grade was a very good 4.4 stars out a possible 5 star rating. To be sure, there were some complaints. But the cumulative experience with this home gym was good.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<i>Ellery </i>is a personal trainer from New York. He gives the Bowflex PR1000 home gym a 4 star rating. In his review, Ellery addresses the concern some people raise about only having 210 lbs. of resistance.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>"I have been a personal fitness trainer for many years and at first I too
 was a skeptic about the whole resistance rod thing. I have read other 
reviews where people who bought this particular unit say that 210lbs is 
not enough weight to get a good work out.<br /><br />I would suggest to 
those of you who think you need more weight than that to try slowing the
 motion of your reps on whatever exercise you are doing way, way down. 
Say for instance you are doing bicep curls: As you curl up, do so with a
 slow count of 8. At the bottom of the movement start the count at one, 
then SLOWY curl it up to the top of the movement ending on eight, then 
do the same on the way back down to the bottom of the movement to get 
the negative resistance, which makes each single rep more like two reps 
both positive and negative, up then down.<br /><br />This will cause you to 
have to MUSCLE the weight up and down as opposed to using momentum. I 
would also suggest that you try working each muscle group to failure if 
you can handle it. This method can make 20lbs seem like 50 after just 
two sets if you do it correctly. Mind you, you will be so very soar, but
 in a good way and the results will no doubt satisfy"</i></blockquote>
<br />
<i>French</i>, from Idaho Falls, Idaho says he absolutely loves his new home gym. Perhaps the 7 pound weight loss is why.&nbsp; He gave it 4 stars, saying the only drawback was "not enough weight to work the legs". Still, French feels the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. <br />
<br />
<i>MusicLover</i> from Maine found the PR1000 only adequate. She advises you to try the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AS4YRQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001AS4YRQ">Bowflex PR3000 Home Gym</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001AS4YRQ" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /> for more resistance. Here is part of what she had to say.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>&nbsp;"The machine itself appears to be of good quality.  And after the first 
workout, I am sore, which is what's to be expected.  But I am an 
overweight, out-of-shape, 50-yr-old woman and even I could Leg Press the
 full weight (210lbs) on my first workout.  And unfortunately, as others
 have observed, you cannot upgrade the PR1000.<br /><br />This seems to me 
to be the second drawback, for which I docked them their second star.  
Coupled with the relatively low maximum weight, I could see the 
inability to upgrade being a big limitation for most men and any strong 
woman who is already in great shape.  If that's you, I would skip this 
machine and spend the money on another model - or plan to supplement it.<br /><br />Since
 I don't come anywhere near to maxing out the weight for any of the 
upper-torso exercises, the machine is still very useful to me.  If my 
upper body is able to max it out in a year or two I will be delighted.  
But for a really effective full-body workout, I'll have to pull out my 
old "Thighs of Steel" and "Buns of Steel" videos to supplement my 
treadmill/Bowflex regimen"
      </i></blockquote>

You can read more of these reviews <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/B001AS697O/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">here.</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" /><br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
So it seems that what you want from a home gym will largely determine whether or not you will be happy with a home gym like the Bowflex PR 1000. If you want to lift heavy weights and max out your strength and muscle gain, you would probably be happier with&nbsp; the Bowflex PR3000 or some other home gym with more capacity.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you want a economical home gym with a good variety of resistance exercises that can give you a good overall workout from head to toe, this may be the gym for you.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4492444098437691579-7761134961194625631?l=home-exercise-equipment.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

<b>What is the philosophy behind Biom by Ecco?</b><br />
<br />
Let's start at the beginning. That was 1963 when a Danish family based business started. The company that was started was dubbed Ecco. Their passion - their focus- was on the human foot.<br />
<br />
ECCO soon gained a reputation worldwide for comfort in the footwear they designed. Their focus on the foot give them a unique insight. Ecco found that the regular running shoes on the market confined feet. They wanted to support the foot's natural motion.<br />

<b>This led to the Biom Project.</b> The idea was profoundly simple - create a natural motion running shoe.<br />
<br />
<br />
World champion Triathlete Torbjorn Sindbale&nbsp; was involved in all phases of the development of the Biom project from the start. From the scientific background to the actual production, Trobjorn was there.<br />
<br />
He was involved in testing and research. He gave input into the concept and philosophy. <br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vlkIQ9li1vA/T6vUbRAClyI/AAAAAAAABlU/JOCFSsaAZQ0/s1600/trobjorn.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vlkIQ9li1vA/T6vUbRAClyI/AAAAAAAABlU/JOCFSsaAZQ0/s1600/trobjorn.jpg" /></a></div>
Torbjorn was initially somewhat skeptical. He had been running in motion control shoes and needed to run a full marathon in the Biom before he could fully believe in and use these shoes. <br />
<br />
He found out that "all the little things" he had experienced with muscles not being strong enough to handle the running load was not a thing of the past. He say his muscles developed again and got stronger due to the natural running motion his Ecco Biom running shoes allowed.<br />
<br />
<b>Trobjorn counsels patience. </b>He says it is going to take time transitioning from a motion control shoe to the natural motion of Biom. It will take some time, he says. But, over time, Biom running shoes are going to allow you to train at a higher level and see big performance gains.<br />

This is an excellent walking shoe that provides you with a very natural walking motion. The fit is snug and comfortable. They are lightweight, close to the ground, and offer good arch support.<br />

Here is what one lady from Greeneville, South Carolina had to say about her new walking shoes.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>" I wear these shoes every day.  I tried them on at the mall after wearing
 my "dress shoes" all day, and my feet and back went from achey and 
tired to feeling quite good, despite the fact that I'd been on my feet 
in uncomfortable shoes all day.  I have a low arch, and these shoes 
support it without pushing up on my foot too much.  My only complaint is
 that the cushioning has worn down a little faster than I'd like 
(especially given the price), but they're still in very good condition.<br /><br />These
 are definitely shoes to try on before you buy; that's a big chunk of 
money, and it sounds like this shoe is particularly good for my foot 
shape as opposed to others'."&nbsp; </i>- <a href="http://www.eccousa.com/shoes/biom/womens/walking/womens-biom-walk-textile-1.2/2532/detail.aspx#ReviewHeader" target="_blank">from Ecco Customer reviews</a>.</blockquote>

Read what Briany had to say.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
&nbsp;"<i>I don't review many products, but I had to share my experience with this
 shoe.  I am on my feet a lot at work, and looked at this shoe because I
 have found Ecco dress shoes to be the most comfortable.  Well, this 
walking shoe has put every other shoe I've ever owned to the test.  It 
literally feels like putting a glove on my foot, and with a Walking 
Company orthotic to correct my overpronation, I may never wear another 
shoe again.  The price is high, no doubt about it, but I have a hard 
time finding comfortable shoes, and Ecco seems to have the right last 
for my feet.  The science behind the Biom thing is beyond me, all I can 
say is it works.  I can't say they would be right for everbody, but for 
me, this is now the gold standard shoe that all others I wear have to 
compare.<br /><br />I will be curious to see if the leather and construction
 is as durable as they advertise, but the yak leather feels very 
luxurious.  If they break down too soon, I will amend this review."</i></blockquote>

David pretty much agrees.&nbsp; <i></i><br />
<i><br /></i><br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>"I did a lot of research on top shoe brands and ECCO is one of the best. 
It's not consistently the top brand by most reviewers, but they 
definitely offer the most attractive shoe designs out of the top brands.
 I work in retail so I'm on my feet a lot and I wanted to go for a super
 comfortable shoe. When you first put this shoe on, it feels like a 
slightly better than average walking shoe, but you don't really notice 
how great of a shoe this is until you start putting a little weight on 
the feet by hopping or lightly jogging. This shoe being made of yak 
leather is said to be 5x stronger than regular leather so I hopefully 
will be enjoying the comfort of this shoe for many years to come. So 
perhaps dishing out the extra dollars for this will be worth it in the 
long run (no pun intended).<br /><br />UPDATE 10/19/11: This is an awesome 
walking shoe. And that's what this shoe should be used for. Walking. I 
tried jogging in them for a short distance before and they're okay for 
that, but they get a little uncomfortable. I don't believe the shoe 
insert was made to handle jogging so I would recommend buying inserts if
 you want to use these shoes for that. But with that said I'll stick to a
 pair of cross training shoes for my exercising. These shoes are still 
as comfortable as the day I got them. Anytime I know I'll be doing a lot
 of standing or walking, I'm always sure to put these on before I go out
 the door.<br /><br />On a side note: I got this in beige. It keeps clean 
well and and I get a lot of compliments. Its an attractive looking shoe 
and there's really nothing out there like it."</i></blockquote>

<i>&nbsp;"I've played for 15 years and usually walk.  These saved my feet.  Super comfortable.  The best I've ever worn.<br /><br />I
 used to buy cheap shoes and buy new ones more often.  Wrong.  Invest 
money on these shoes.  It is worth twice the price.  You have to try on 
any shoe but you'll see as soon as you put these on"

<i>Melari</i> thinks they are a great looking shoe that she can wear anywhere. <i>"I really liked the appearance.  I took these shoes with me to London, 
and walked everywhere.  They were comfortable.  I did try using them in 
my kickboxing class, and I felt I needed a bit more cushion for that 
type of activity.  Otherwise, it's a great shoe."</i><br />

You'll still get the minimalist feel but with a thicker sole. <br />
<br />
Bill writes, "<i> ...I have two pairs of the Hattori, with nearly 130 miles between them, and
 for longest runs of 7-8 miles.  These are really good minimal cushioned
 shoes that fit the niche between traditional neutral cushioned trainers
 and BF shoes like Vibram Five Fingers (VFF).<br /><br />The Hattori is 
similar to Nike Free 3.0 in weight, flexibility and cushioning-- but 
with no heel-toe drop.  They have a slightly tighter fit than NF with 
the slipper-like construction."</i><br />
<br />
The Hattori is Saucony's lightest, most minimal shoe to date. The out-sole material is a very durable carbon rubber with exceptional traction. <br />

The added protection is a great feature for many trail runners but true - ( read : hardcore ) - minimalist may not like it.<br />
<br />
One reviewer, ultramen, summed up his experience like this.<i>" I've ran more than 100ks with this pair, mostly on trails. These are very light and comfortable even in rough terrain.<br /><br />Compared
 to my old pairs, my feet never really felt battered after running on 
mt101's on trails, no heelstrikes nor overstriding. My feet are landing 
at the right, natural spots - the forefoot to midfoot.<br /><br />The design is wicked, I had never seen a shoe that imitates the color of a green beetle.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Anton and NB really nailed it with this one."</i><br />
<br />
John, who is new to trail running had this to say.<i> "Being new at trail running and the minimalist running style, I tried 
vibrams 5 fingers and the running sandle described in "Born To Run". I 
liked both of these but felt a little too unprotected.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
<i>The 101's solved 
all these issues and still felt very minimal. I have done some trail 
runs and speed workouts on the track and they performed great. Very 
light, feet felt very natural at ground strike and for the first time in
 any running shoe, I had no blisters from the very first run. Great 
product and am anxiously awaiting the "minimalist" shoe to come out in 
early 2011."</i><br />

<i>&nbsp;Phil</i> calls them the best shoes he's ever had. <i>"I just ran for the first time in my new Terra Plana Evos.  These shoes 
are fantastic.  I ran for about a year in Nike Free 7.0 then a year in 
Nike Free 5.0.  Then I ordered the Nike Free Run+, Nike Free 3.0, and 
Terra Plana Evo.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
<i>The Run+ fit pretty good but because the tongue is not
 separate (it's called a sock) it was a little hard to get into.  But 
once in it did feel pretty good.  It has more cushion than the Nike 5.0 
so if you're into the barefoot running philosophy, then this is a bit of
 a step backward from the 5.0.  The Nike Free 3.0 was very narrow.  I 
returned it.  I wear a ten in most shoes and if I were to try the Nike 
Free 3.0 again I would probably try an 11.  I held the size 10 Nike Free
 3.0 and the size 10 Nike Free Run+ sole to sole and the 3.0 was 
noticably more narrow and slightly shorter.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
<i>With my wide foot I think 
I'll just pass on the Nike Free 3.0.  This is especially true now that I
 ran for the first time in my Terra Plana Evos.  This is a fantastic 
shoe.  It's very light.  It fit perfectly.  I felt like I was runing in 
socks.  It didn't feel like a shoe at all.  This is by far the best 
first try of any shoe I have ever tried.  It's like running in Vibran 
Five Fingers without the hastle of trying to get my rigid toes into the 
toe holes.  I highly recommend the Terra Plana Evo to anyone interested 
in barefoot running, especially if you have a wide foot and/or you don't
 like Five Fingers.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
<i>&nbsp;This shoe is really perfect.  I don't mean to 
discourage those with a narrow foot; I'm sure the laces will make it fit
 anyone.  My point is that for someone with a wide foot who has trouble 
with Nike and other shoes that tend to run narrow, this shoe is the one 
for you!  I love it!"</i><br />

Let's take a look at some representative snippets, shall we?

<i>Angela</i> tells us her husband was ready to try something new after a couple of pairs of Nike Frees. While Hubby's original pair of 7.0 Frees " lasted for several years and were superb" the second pair was never comfortable and began deteriorating after several months. Thus the switch to New Balance Trail Minimus.

These shoes exceeded his expectations and were "easily the best pair of running shoes he has owned right out of the box."<br />
<br />
Angela tells us her husband like the lightweight yet sturdy design, saying the Vibram sole construction is top notch. The fit was accurate and the width was correct unlike other brands. These are the most comfortable shoes he has worn and the heel cup padding is particularly noteworthy. The performance is also great - the vibram sole is " Not too springy, and not too pliable, they provide a perfect balance between a barefoot feel and providing protection from sharp rocks and glass."

<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
<i>Jimi</i> had been using five finger shoes for the past year when he got a pair of Trail Minimus shoes. He calls the, ".. a major breakthrough in footwear". For one thing, these shoes are more "versatile stylistically". Jimi can wear these shoe with jeans or shorts without getting the stares a pair of five finger footwear might generate!

As you might expect, the New Balance Trail Minimus shoes offer more support.<br />
<br />
But Jimi finds them also less restrictive that five fingers " which kind of make my toes feel stiff due to the material separating them.' With plenty of room in the toe box Jimi has a more fuller range of motion for his toes. He's " ...been telling everyone I know to try these shoes. They are really THAT great. "

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<span style="font-size: small;"><b style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 1em;">Take a different approach to trail running. New Balance Trail Minimus shoes for women and men have the durable yet lightweight Minimal Vibram® and a fitted, very minimalist upper. These two items combine for a shoe lets you experience trail with a nearly barefoot experience.

The drop from heel to toe is only about a third of what you would expect from traditional running shoes. The superior light weight foam used in the mid-sole is exceptionally durable. It is 12% lighter than conventional foam yet this highly engineered foam resists compression set.

All this technology works together to give you a trail shoe you can use with or without shoes to gain a comfortable and enjoyable near barefoot running experience. </b></span></div>

 approach trail running differently than traditional running shoes. Imagine combining the durability of the Vibram® outsole with a fitted minimalist upper.

With a modified upper on the same sole as the WT10, these Trail Minimus shoes give you a near barefoot experience, with or without socks.

<b>So, what do women that have already purchased a pair of these shoes think of them?</b>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<span style="font-size: small;">We found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/B004KZP678/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">dozens of written reviews</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" /> online. The overwhelming rating for these shoes was positive. They scored an impressive 4.6 out of 5 stars. Here are the highlighted stories of several women that have already bought a pair of New Balance Trail Minimus shoes for themselves.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<span style="font-size: small;">&nbsp;<i>Ace</i> had owned several pairs of New Balance shoes before. In addition, she had over the years also owned Pumas, Converse, and Nike shoes. Ace tells us - <i>" ... but NONE even come close to the New Balance WT20 Trail Minimus shoes. </i> She likes that they are very lightweight without compromising durability or support.

The traction is "pretty nice", says Ace. She purchased the shoe in WIDE and is glad she did.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<span style="font-size: small;">The only drawback as Ace sees it is the limited choice in colors. She wishes New Balance offered more! She's how Ace sums it up.

<i>" ...So...If you're looking for a shoe that is both good looking AND comfortable, I recommend you give these a try. My sister doesn't even like sneakers and after seeing mine she's thinking of getting herself a pair in black and pink. If you suffer from chronic foot/ankle pain like me, you'll be pleasantly surprised at how supportive and yet comfortable these shoes are. Pardon the trite expression but you'll feel like you're walking on air. =D

Bottom line: An awesome shoe!!! '</i>

<i>&nbsp;</i></span></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<span style="font-size: small;"><i>Diane</i> suggests you " ... take it slowly and use these shoes for off road.". She suggests using the Trail Minimus shoes in conjunction with regular running shoes in order to give your muscles plenty of time to adjust. She says her shoes are comfortable and light. They fit her narrow feet well and " snuggly:)".

<i>&nbsp;</i></span></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<br /></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<span style="font-size: small;"><i>Lacey</i> tells us her New Balance Trail Minimus running shoes, " ...CHANGED MY LIFE..." After suffering from bad knees and shin splints for years, she was researching barefoot running. Lacey discovered several cases of "improving knee pain and shin splints due to the foot not being on an incline like so many other shoes do in the heel."

At first Lacey tried five finger running shoes.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<br /></div>
<span style="font-size: small;">These were not a good fit for her however and the specialty shop where she bought her five finger shoes suggested she try the Trail Minimus shoes. It turned out to be a great buy as Lacey writes.

<i>&nbsp;</i></span><br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<span style="font-size: small;"><i>" ...I run in these nearly everyday, on a treadmill and outdoors. Great traction, really light feeling, excellent flexibility and most of all I have minor to no knee pain and my shin splints have disappeared. And unlike the five-finger I did not feel the need to spend several weeks working my way into them. I do suggest wearing a lighter/thinner sock with them as they are very light themselves, thicker socks make them feel stiff. I am thinking about buying a second pair just in case they stop making them. Even though my shoes look nearly brand new after 8 months of running 3-6 times a week. Great Buy!!!! "</i></span></blockquote>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[A reader, who plays baseball, asks if it is okay for an athlete to do P90X?<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z8Nas0_5M14/T5rHuICJ_7I/AAAAAAAABkE/NI1kSIH2MPI/s1600/baseball+player.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Z8Nas0_5M14/T5rHuICJ_7I/AAAAAAAABkE/NI1kSIH2MPI/s200/baseball+player.png" width="180" /></a></div>
The answer is : P90X makes a great workout for most anyone that is already in pretty good physical fitness. Many athletes - even professional athletes - are incorporating P90X into their training. <br />
<br />
With workout ranging from plyometrics to yoga to strength building and cardiovascular health, P90X improves athletic and everyday performance. <br />
<br />
Athletes need flexibility, strength, the ability to move powerfully and athletically. They need strength, balance, and endurance. Believe me, P90X addresses all of these.<br />
<br />
<b>A well thought out nutrition plan is included as well.</b> With the P90X program you can go at it as hard or as easy as you need to. It is infinitely flexible in that way. You can continue using and modifying the program long after the initial 90 days. I've been using, enjoying, and benefiting my P90X DVDs for years. <br />
<br />
I guess I'm still an athlete of sorts ( 54 years old and play golf regularly). But whether you are a high school or college athletic or play professionally, I say you can get something out of P90X. <br />

Actually, we have found some shoes that might help you. At least that's what we glean from the men and women that have tried them and gotten relief from their particular foot aches and pains. <br />
<br />
We are talking about the Asics Gel Evolution 6 shoes for men and women. Let's take a look at what some happy users of these shoes have to say.<br />
<br />
First, take the case of<i> Azazello</i> who runs approximately 20 miles or so a week. He does this even with "extremely flat feet and overpronation." Azazello says his new Gel Evolution 6 running shoes have good support and are "really comfortable".<br />
<br />
Jon reported running with no pain after the initial breaking in phase.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>"I have flat foot, and i was also a little overweight, which lead to shin splints that makes running almost impossible for me.<br />I've
 decided to buy these shoes and give it a try. In the first 2 weeks I 
ran and played tennis with them. But the pain was still there. After 2 
weeks pain started to reduce, I started to run better, changed my eating
 style to a more healthy one. And now I've been running with them for 
almost 6 months now, and I have no pain,  I'm healthier, more fit and I 
can run better. These shoes worked magical for me, not only lead me to a
 painless run, but inspired me to loose weight.<br /><br />I strongly 
recommend them if you suffer from shin splints. They don't look very 
nice (but beauty is in the eye of beholder) so you can't wear them under
 jeans really, but they function so well that I'm giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />Also i received the shipping quickly and without problems from Amazon"</i> </blockquote>

<br />
Ladies love Gel Foundation 6 shoes as well. <i>Modchic</i> tells us that she is "flat-footed, over-weight, and I over-pronate..." . She even has pain when going barefoot. With the help of this "great shoe", Mod is looking forward to walking and eventually even running again.<br />
<br />
<i>S.King</i>, who calls her Gel Foundation 6s "the best running shoes yet", offers some advice.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>" ... I tried on several running shoes in sneaker stores.  The salespeople 
always try to sell me the Asics Kayanos (the most expensive Asics...but I
 feel uncomfortable the second I put Kayanos on) and stores don't all 
stock the Asics Evolution so I ordered it from amazon hoping I would 
love this model as I have loved my previous generations of the Asics 
Evolution.  Its the best so far!  The comfort of slippers and every part
 of my foot feels properly supported as opposed to other sneakers that 
feel like my foot only touches certain areas or overcorrects.  I had 
chronic ankle soreness that I was learning to live with that disappeared
 within days of using my new evolutions."</i></blockquote>

While recognizing that there are all kinds of feet and walking situations, we recommend you check out the walking line from New Balance. ( This is from someone that walks a hour everyday. ) I've bought pair after pair of New Balance shoes for everyday life - walking, standing, shopping, etc.<br />
<br />
If your feet have special conditions such as plantar fasciitis or if you need a special shoe because of diabetes, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=new%20balance%20927&amp;url=search-alias%3Daps" target="_blank">New Balance 927 walking shoes</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" width="1" />.<br />

They have features like a seamless&nbsp; inner liner that reduces irritation to your feet.<br />

When we checked, they were less than $50. Customers seem to be pleased with these shoes Here is what one reviewer (&nbsp; <i>Dingle98</i> ) wrote.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>"Having been unhappy with most of my choices of walking shoes over the 
last few decades...despite paying more and more over time, I decided 
this time I'd check reviews on Amazon...and this particular Avia shoe 
had an extraordinary percentage of very satisfied buyers.<br /><br />Add my 
endorsement to them. This is by far the most comfortable walking shoe 
I've ever had. Fits like a glove, comfortable to use for extended 
periods, and the price was excellent.<br /><br />Did take the advice of a couple of previous buyers and ordered a size larger than normal and that worked out perfect"</i></blockquote>

Women were generally happy with their purchase of these shoes. This review from <i>S. Lewis</i> is typical.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>"I needed some new walking shoes that would support my feet well and this
 brand was recommended to me. I was surprised by the reasonable price. 
They are great! Very comfortable and, so far, after 2 months are holding
 up well. My only regret is that I couldn't get the pink stripe instead 
of the blue... But, I wasn't going to pay $20 more just to have pink. 
Great shoes, highly recommend!"

Asics GT 2170 Men's running shoes are the latest updating of Asics most popular shoes. Why are these shoes so popular? Let's see what the men who wear them have to say.<br />
<br />
<i>Gary</i> calls his GT 2170 s&nbsp; the "best running shoes ever!". Why is Gary so enthusiastic? <br />
<br />
 <br />
<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">

<div style="font-family: Georgia,&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">
<span style="font-size: small;">We found the best deals for the Asics GT 2170 running shoes, and many other running shoes, at Amazon. <b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058C6N6K/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0058C6N6K">Buy your ASICS Men's Gt-2170 Running Shoes from Amazon and save.</a><img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0058C6N6K" style="border: medium none ! important; margin: 0px ! important;" width="1" />
&nbsp; </b></span></div>
<br />
&nbsp;A combination of "...Plantar Fasciitis in both feet and a painful heel spur in the right" along with a lot of running was causing him to be uncomfortable in his shoes after using them for just a few miles.<br />
<br />
He tried Brooks, Saucony, Nike, New Balance shoes and even a few Asics models without getting satisfaction. Finally, Gary tried a pair of Asics Gt 2170 running shoes. ( I think you know where this is going.) Here is how Gary put it.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>" ... Without any doubt, I can honestly tell you that I now have my best pair 
of running shoes I've ever owned. There is plenty of gel, foam, cushion 
and yet a firm-like support structure throughout the shoes that I can't 
recall ever feeling and now makes me want to run further than before and
 has got me feeling the joy of running when I first started to get into 
the sport. Even the sides of my feet are feeling good after a 10 mile 
run this morning. ..."</i></blockquote>
<i>Oswald </i>is not a runner but says his Asics Gt 2170s are <i>"terrific for walking and daily wear."</i> He especially likes their light weight and great arch support. When the time comes to buy a new pair of shoes, Oswald says he'll be shopping for Asics Gel shoes.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, <i>pep</i> was not impressed. He owned a pair of Brooks GTS Adrenaline 11s and found the transition from heel to toe<i> " ... no where near a smooth as the Brooks. ..."</i>&nbsp; But his was the only negative review we saw.<br />
<br />
Bill described himself as an <i>"out of shape guy who wanted to get back into shape and running"</i>.<span style="vertical-align: middle;"> For the price range, Bill thought his Gt 2170s were definitely the most comfortable shoes out there. He loved the look, feel, and value. He says,<i> "Get these shoes, you wont be disappointed!" </i><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/B0058C6N6K/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957" target="_blank">Read the latest customer reviews of the Asics GT 2170 running shoes here.</a></b></span><br />

Minimalist running shoes with less cushioning and lowered heels have become a popular alternative to the more traditional running shoes.<br />
<br />
Proponents of minimalist running consider it a more natural approach to running. They tell us that the minimalist style of running promotes running on the fore foot and mid-foot. Running this way leads to less injury that the heel strike landing that normal running shoes promote, they say.<br />
<br />
Proponents of minimalist running point out that this is not a fad. It is in line with the natural way men and women have ran since the dawn of time. Highly cushioned running shoes with a thick heel became popular starting in the 1970's. Minimalist claim these cushioned shoes cause a <a href="http://www.thepeacefulrunner.com/barefoot-running.html#axzz1rTCejfuY" target="_blank">high percentage of running related injuries</a>. <br />

<br />
Is P90X an effective way to burn calories? Just how many calories can I expect to burn during a P90X workout?<br />
<br />
A P90X workout is an effective way to burn calories and working out six day a week with this program is bound to help you burn off calories. It is just impossible to give you a highly accurate forecast to how many calories you can expect to shed.<br />
<br />
That said, we found an estimate of <b>700 calories per workout</b> on the P90X message boards. You can go to that discussion <a href="http://www.teambeachbody.com/connect/message-boards/-/message_boards/message/19575649" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. <br />
<br />
I would imagine that 700 calories per workout is at the high end of the spectrum. Of course how many calories you or I shed depends on our fitness level, workout intensity, and many other factors. P90X is not a weight loss program but many people report losing weight during by using the program. This is all the more impressive when you consider they probably increased their lean body mass so the loss in weight was more likely to be permanent.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that P90X is a highly effective extreme fitness program for many people. If you are ready to get into tip top shape - the best of your life - it's a real good program to take you there.<br />

<br />
The question is asked, <b>"How much space do you need in order to do the P90X program?"</b> That's one of the great things about P90x - you don't need a whole lot of space to comfortably do the workouts.<br />
<br />
I workout in an empty corner of my office. Others report being able to comfortably get in their P90X workouts from a hotel room, den, or bedroom. A 6 foot by 9 foot area next to a television with a DVD player and a door frame are all you need and you're ready to "Bring It" and get into the best shape of your life.<br />

Most other cross trainers I've had would slip a  lot and I could never get the laces tight enough to hold my foot in  place inside the shoe. There's no problem with that with the asics gel  express cross trainers. I feel like these shoes were made for my feet!"</blockquote><br /><br />James wrote this.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"By far the best cross trainers I have ever had the pleasure of owning.  It is true that Asics run a little small concerning the sizes, but I  found that by using them my foot stretched the shoe and it fits like a  glove with absolutely no slippage and extremely comfortable as well. I  will buy again absolutely!!!!!!!"</span></blockquote><br />An amazing amount of technology goes into a pair of ASICS.

      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/HomeExerciseEquipmentReviewsAndTips/~3/kCchyZfe82Y/whats-equipment-needed-for-p90x.html</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OU-aunE4CEI/T2IJDvx_7BI/AAAAAAAABhQ/gtyM6SjLtEw/s1600/P90X-Equipment.png"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 250px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OU-aunE4CEI/T2IJDvx_7BI/AAAAAAAABhQ/gtyM6SjLtEw/s400/P90X-Equipment.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5720144436684385298" border="0" /></a><br />The <span style="font-weight: bold;">equipment needed for P90X according to the fitness guide</span> of the P90X package includes a chin up bar, resistance bands and/or dumbbells, a heart rate monitor, and push up bars. They also list a yoga mat, yoga blocks and a body fat tester.<br /><br />While the more of these items you have in your home gym the better, many of us started out without the complete group and added items each time through the program.<br /><br />Having a <span style="font-weight: bold;">good set of resistance bands</span> is a must. The <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://teambeachbody.com/shop/-/shopping/BLINEBandKits?referringRepId=38076">B Lines resistance bands</a> are perfect for P90X. This kit has color coded resistance bands at different levels of resistance. There are 2 resistance bands plus an additional free band included with the kit. It also comes with 2 sets of handles with comfort grips.<br /><br />With resistance bands you can burn fat and tone lean muscle. Because they are portable and convenient you can take them with you when you are on the more. These resistance bands are especially popular among women.<br /><br /><a href="http://teambeachbody.com/shop/-/shopping/ChinUpBar?referringRepId=38076"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px; height: 250px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nip9ZMa6-T4/T2INiHBxYnI/AAAAAAAABhc/YJjZChNr-vU/s320/p90x%2Bchin%2Bup%2Bbar.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5720149356367143538" border="0" /></a>A reliable and safe pull up bar, like the <a href="http://teambeachbody.com/shop/-/shopping/ChinUpBar?referringRepId=38076"><span style="font-weight: bold;">P90X Chin Up Bar</span> </a>will help you develop and strengthen the muscle groups of the upper back as well as you shoulders and arms.<br /><br />It really made a difference in my results when I got this chin up bar. Things I like about it include the fact that you can do chin ups and pull ups from multiple positions with this bar. It has a 300 lb. maximum user capacity and it removes and attaches easily to the door that I use.<br /><br />The P90X Chin Up bar is made of heavy gauge steel. The doorway you use it with needs to be sturdy and must have the border trim. It fits doorways up to 32 inches wide. The minimum door width is 5 inches. The max is 6.5 inches.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ARYU58/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001ARYU58"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 300px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sfhQo0pxAcA/T2IWyAU15FI/AAAAAAAABho/KYlXJcT-vfs/s320/bowflex%2Bselecttech.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5720159525050639442" border="0" /></a>Weight resistance exercise to build strength and muscle make up a large portion of P90X. Depending on your level of fitness - and your fitness goals - you will need either a good set of dumbbells or a set of resistance bands. If you want to build muscle, it is recommended you have a set of dumbbells at the ready.<br /><br />A set of adjustable dumbbells, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ARYU58/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001ARYU58"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bowflex Selecttech dumbbells</span></a> allow you to quickly adjust the amount of weight as you move from exercise to exercise. In addition they are designed to keep your workout space uncluttered. A set of these dumbbells is like having pairs of dumbbells in one.<br /><br />A good <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/mn/search/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;field-keywords=heart%20rate%20monitor&amp;url=search-alias%3Dsporting&amp;sprefix=heart%20rate%20monitor%2Csporting%2C199">heart rate monitor</a><img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> lets you measure the intensity and progress you are making. This is a must have when you are engaged in an extreme fitness program.<br /><br />Yoga in an important part of P90X. While the yoga workout included in P90X is undoubtedly intense - especially if you have never done much yoga- the benefits are undeniable. Your progress will be even more impressive with the right yoga mat and a good pair of yoga blocks.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o4_sC0QlXCI/T2InbLXbyMI/AAAAAAAABh0/ZzFoCqDQNlk/s1600/yoga%2Bblocks.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 300px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-o4_sC0QlXCI/T2InbLXbyMI/AAAAAAAABh0/ZzFoCqDQNlk/s320/yoga%2Bblocks.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5720177824574982338" border="0" /></a>The <a href="http://teambeachbody.com/shop/-/shopping/yogaMat?referringRepId=38076">Yoga Mat</a> from Beachbody is a thick, textured sticky mat that stabilizes your yoga and lets you concentrate on things like proper alignment and balance. It measures 24" by 68" and is hand washable.<br /><br />The <a href="http://teambeachbody.com/shop/-/shopping/MDACCYBLOCK2101?referringRepId=38076">Yoga Block</a> set has 2 blocks that are great for assisting you as you work to deepen postures and they also can stabilize your posture in poses that are difficult for you. Each yoga block measures 4" by 6" by 9".<br /><br /><br />Push up bars are great for getting a larger range of motion when doing your push ups. It is also more comfortable to do pushups with these - especially if you have wrist problems like me.<br /><br />I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KDM3BG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000KDM3BG">Perfect Push Up </a>set. They are durable and comfortable. They also turn and let you move your arms in a more natural motion.<br /><br />The P90X guide also mentions a body fat tester. Since my scale has a somewhat accurate percent body fat measurement, I just use that. Here is the link for the <a href="http://teambeachbody.com/shop/-/shopping/MDACCBODFATK2?referringRepId=38076">Body Fat Tester</a> in case you are interested.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier in this article, while you can get all of this equipment at once you don't have to. I add to my fitness equipment as time goes by. After going through P90X for a while, you'll get a sense of just what your workouts need to give you a boost in performance.<br /><br />******<br /><br />Related: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/equipment-for-p90x">Equipment for P90X</a><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4492444098437691579-7622713363779274335?l=home-exercise-equipment.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

Dumbbells for women must match the particular needs of women.<br /><br />While recognizing that each woman is an individual, most women do not want to develop large, bulky muscles when they exercise.<br /><br />This causes many to avoid weights altogether. But the proper set of dumbbells combined with the right fitness plan can deliver the lean, toned look that many women desire.<br /><br />Below we will highlight some of the more popular dumbbell sets that women are using, enjoying, and gaining health benefits from.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KUkJQcufv48/T1ev727XTbI/AAAAAAAABgg/Hb9nz8vZbu4/s1600/Altus%2BAthletic%2B32-Pound%2BDumbbell%2BSet.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KUkJQcufv48/T1ev727XTbI/AAAAAAAABgg/Hb9nz8vZbu4/s200/Altus%2BAthletic%2B32-Pound%2BDumbbell%2BSet.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5717231694861782450" border="0" /></a>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032HONJW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0032HONJW">Altus Athletic 32-Pound Dumbbell Set</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=folthenewyory-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0032HONJW" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> comes with a stand to organize and store your dumbbell sets. The set includes pairs of 3 pound, 5 pound, and 8 pound weight - perfect for the fitness needs of many women. The steel dumbbells are covered with soft neoprene for comfort.<br /><br />This dumbbell set for women received a 4.8 out of 5 star rating from the combined scores of 16 customer reviews at Amazon. Here is how one review put it. <span style="font-style: italic;">"I bought this for my daughter who is 16 and she loves it. She wants to  work out with different weights not too heavy so she can keep herself in  shape. It made me too want to exercise. "</span><br /><br />( 214 )<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CmDCv0p-TEo/T1eyVWaFBbI/AAAAAAAABgs/jlRoEWte90w/s1600/tone%2Bfitness.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CmDCv0p-TEo/T1eyVWaFBbI/AAAAAAAABgs/jlRoEWte90w/s200/tone%2Bfitness.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5717234331832092082" border="0" /></a>A similar dumbbell set is offered by Tone Fitness.

It has pairs of 2, 3, and 5 pound dumbbells.<br /><br />The hourglass shape is not only stylish, it also is easy to handle. A neoprene coating makes the weights softer and more comfortable.<br /><br />Twenty-one customer reviews gave this dumbbell set a combined score of 4.3 out of a possible 5 stars.<br /><br />Most reviewers were happy with their purchase but a few thought the storage rack was rather cheaply made. Here is what one happy customer wrote.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">" I bought these dumbbell a few weeks ago and I have been very happy with  the quality. I use them for walking and some light toning exercises.  They have a nice grip and the weight sizes are perfect for me. I love  the fun colors too.

I have done TurboJam (Chalene Johnson's other major cardio DVD program)  since 2006 and have enjoyed it immensely.  TurboFire is billed as a more  intense, complex cousin to TurboJam, and I have to agree with that.   Even with over four years of pretty difficult cardio conditioning,  TurboFire was still a challenge from the outset.  Even the 30-minute  Fire workout is more difficult than any TurboJam program...."</span> Rachel from customer reviews.</blockquote><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">TurboFire Results</span><br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YOa7KdnZ4D8/T0JWkkgT3VI/AAAAAAAABf0/xFKZHt3UGHw/s1600/turbo%2Bfire%2Bresults.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 121px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YOa7KdnZ4D8/T0JWkkgT3VI/AAAAAAAABf0/xFKZHt3UGHw/s400/turbo%2Bfire%2Bresults.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5711222463733685586" border="0" /></a>Getting results with the TurboFire workouts is what it is all about, right?

Steve states that,<br /><blockquote style="font-style: italic;"><br />"P90X is not a weight loss program, yet most people lose weight by doing  it. This is because most of those people begin the program with more  body fat than they're happy with, and getting ripped means they've lost  body fat and weight. But some people want more. They want nothing but to  be lean. ..."</blockquote><br /><br />Then he goes on to point out that the lean and doubles plans are designed with weight loss more in mind than the classic P90x schedule. But, he notes, <span style="font-style: italic;">"... losing weight has a lot more to do with how you do the program than which option you choose."</span><br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">The Key to Getting Lean</span><br /><br />He suggests that if you want to become lean begin with the lean program and then progress to the doubles program. To further modify your program for maximhttp://www.blogger.com/img/blank.gifum ( lean ) results, Steve suggest lighter weight and more reps. The key is to use enough weight to fail at the end of each set.<br /><br />If getting lean is your fitness goal, the <a href="http://teambeachbody.com/shop/-/shopping/P90X?referringRepId=38076">P90X Fitness Program</a> can get you there.

I utilize this machine, along with a low carb diet and walking 3-4 miles  2 to 3 times a week, to lose 75 pounds! I started this last September  2008- weighing in at nearly 300 pounds at 6'1".  As of now, end of March  2009, I am down to 225 and feel great!  That's it, no magic other than  consistency! If it were not for this rower, my efforts would have been  much, much less successful. .. "</span></blockquote><br /><br />Another reviewer considers her purchase of the Concept2 rower as an investment.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">'The Concept2 Indoor Rowing Machine is the universal standard for quality  rowing machines. If you want to perform this indoor exercise correctly,  this is the machine to use. If you visit any high school, college, or  club rowing program you will find Concept2 rowing machines are likely  the only rowing machines they use. It is good for sweep rowers and  scullers, gives you lots of workout feedback, and requires very little  maintenance. </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">My model D has over 2,000,000 meters on it and neither of  us show any sign of slowing down. Older, used Model A, B, and C indoor  rowers still retain their value, work well, and have faithful and  dedicated users. If you're going to purchase an indoor rower, make an  investment for the long-term because this machine (or the Model E) is  the only one to consider."</span><br style="font-style: italic;"></blockquote><br />One reviewer points out that the Concept2 rower is "not just for elite athletes". A self described, "dumpy, middle aged woman" with a hip replacement, <span style="font-style: italic;">M.Ricky</span> say she can recommend this rowing machine without reservation.<br /><br /><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">"  ... I spent the first week focusing on correct technique and not killing  myself.  The machine comes with two booklets, a memory card, and a  bottle of chain oil.  The Indoor Rowing booklet has a lot of good  information on proper form and suggested workouts starting from your  very first day.  </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">There are also videos and active user forums on the  Concept2 website.  I've been following the suggestions, started slowly,  set the damper at 3 and have left it there.  Most nights I row from 25  to 40 minutes followed by stretching (recommended: AM/PM Stretch with  Madeleine Lewis or AM Yoga for Your Week with Rodney Yee). </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I spent a  lot of time on form and kept my stroke rate at about 18-19 spm.  Slow,  right?  But I don't get sloppy and as I get stronger it seems that  upping the stroke rate doesn't really improve my performance all that  much.  </span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Before I started rowing, the morning routine was to get out of  bed with cramping in my thigh and buttocks that nearly put me in tears.   No joke: this disappeared overnight as soon as I started rowing.  I  felt a little soreness, mostly in my upper back, but zero lower back  pain and no cramping AT ALL.  One week of this was worth the $900. "</span></blockquote><br />Again, the customer reviews are almost universal in their praise of the Concept2 Model D Indoor Rowing machine. They not only praise the rowers utility and smoothness but also point to it's durability.<br /><br />The Concept2 is currently in stock at Amazon and can be delivered via Standard Shipping.<br /><div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001A0ZT2I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=folthenewyory-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001A0ZT2I">Buy the Concept2 at Amazon. </a><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">A Comparison of the Concept2 Model D and Model E Indoor Rowers</span><br /><br />Not sure whether the Model D or Model E is right for you?

      <title>Preventing Muscle Soreness - A Few Tips</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uWuGWji5AfI/TyrJmTUaIDI/AAAAAAAABd8/lHET9djM1OM/s1600/lower%2Bback%2Bpain.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 319px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uWuGWji5AfI/TyrJmTUaIDI/AAAAAAAABd8/lHET9djM1OM/s320/lower%2Bback%2Bpain.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5704593537876238386" border="0" /></a><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Muscle soreness</span> suffered from exercise is something we would all like to prevent - or at least minimize.  And while it is no doubt true that at least a little soreness in the muscles we have been exercising is unavoidable, there are some easy things we can do to make that soreness less severe.<br /><br />If you are just starting out exercising - or significantly changing your exercise routine - progress slowly and gradually. Give yourself a couple of weeks to ease into a full workout schedule. I use this method whenever I commit to 13 weeks of <a href="http://teambeachbody.com/shop/-/shopping/P90X?referringRepId=38076">P90X</a>.<br /><br />I simply take two weeks before the formal program and go through some of the workouts - especially X Stretch and Yoga X. That way I'm not starting from scratch.<br /><br />And whenever you workout take 5 to 10 minutes to warm up and stretch your muscles. Taking a few minutes to cool down is just as important.<br /><br />A little massage - even self-massaging - of the muscle you have worked out can help with the soreness.<br /><br />While I resist taking muscle relaxers and even aspirin to help relax my muscles, I found a little topically applied Capsaicin can instantly take away any aches and pains. I asked my Doctor about it and he enthusiastically was in favor of it.<br /><br />If you do overdo it ( and we all do at times), don't make matters worse by trying to push through the pain. Back off a little bit from the heavy duty stuff and give your body the time it needs to repair and restore itself. You are not gaining anything by not allowing your body to recover.<br /><br />Preventing muscle soreness is usually just a common sense thing. Listen to your body and you will not go too far astray.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/4492444098437691579-8003755821624175575?l=home-exercise-equipment.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>

That is a very good rating but not everyone was happy.

The T101-3 has a 2.25 horsepower continuous duty motor that <span style="font-weight: bold;">operates powerfully and quietly</span>. </li><li>The frame is large and sturdy. It will stand up to heavy duty workout sessions and has a 300 lb. maximum user capacity. One thing to consider: This is a pretty heavy treadmill ( the shipping weight is 180 lbs.) . You'll want to take this into consideration if you'll need help in getting it into place when your treadmill arrives.</li><li>One of my favorite features of this treadmill is the deck on which you do your walking, jogging, and running. This PerfectFLEX deck has <span style="font-weight: bold;">cushioning</span> that provides you with the correct amount of support and shock absorption. </li><li>The running belt surface  is 20 inches wide and 55 inches long. It is durable and the belt is 1.4 centimeters thick and made of a two ply material. </li><li>You'll be able to <span style="font-weight: bold;">choose from 9 workout program options</span>. Pick your choice of a workout target of either a time, a distance, or a number of calories burned. Then combine that with your choice of either a manual workout, interval training, or a workout for weight loss. The workout that results will be tailored uniquely to your workout demands.</li><li>The Horizon T-101 is a fold-able treadmill. This lets you free up space when you're not using it. The FeatherLIGHT lift make <span style="font-weight: bold;">raising and lowering the running deck very easy</span>. It has two hydraulic lifts to assist you to move the deck up or lower it.</li><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--AYVpMjiILE/Tx7rnnZR4PI/AAAAAAAABdA/fx-mFjS9gaU/s1600/Horizon%2BFitness%2BT101-3%2Bcomputer%2Bconsole.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/--AYVpMjiILE/Tx7rnnZR4PI/AAAAAAAABdA/fx-mFjS9gaU/s200/Horizon%2BFitness%2BT101-3%2Bcomputer%2Bconsole.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5701253244120064242" border="0" /></a><li>The computer console lets you track your workout progress from 3 orange LED windows, an LED brickyard display, and through target/workout indicators.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sonic Surround speakers</span> with MP3 input let you play music through the console speakers to enhance your workout experience.</li><li>The<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Coolfit fitness fan </span>that's built into the T-101-3 treadmill gives you a little air to make workouts more comfortable.</li><li>The speed range goes <span style="font-weight: bold;">up to 10 miles per hour</span> and you can adjust your level of incline from level up to as much as 10 degrees.</li><li>Treadmill Doctor selected this treadmill as a <span style="font-style: italic;">"Best Buy"</span> in it's category.

I went through multiple review forums looking for a treadmill under $700  and finally settled on this. I'm really happy with my choice. You  basically get all you need from this treadmill.

Since it is a Horizon Fitness treadmill, it comes from good ( award winning ) stock.<br /><br />It is a sturdy, well made treadmill - but not the biggest they make.
