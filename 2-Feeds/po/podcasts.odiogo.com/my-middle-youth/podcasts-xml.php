      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As we grow older, losing friends and family members increasingly becomes part of the fabric of our lives. In this article, T-J Hughes writes about the loss of her Mum.</em></p>
<p>Yesterday was the first anniversary of my Mum’s death. And, I just  want to reflect.</p>
<div id="attachment_293">
<h3>We’ve all survived</h3>
<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://support4women.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Mum-on-QE2_jun08.jpg"></a></p>
<div id="attachment_596" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 118px"><a href="http://www.mymiddleyouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Mum-on-QE2_jun08.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-596" title="Mum-on-QE2_jun08" src="http://www.mymiddleyouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Mum-on-QE2_jun08.jpg" alt="" width="108" height="188" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mum in happier times</p></div>
<p>Despite thinking that we’d never get through it, my Dad, brother and I  are still here. Her grandchildren are growing up, as children do. It’s  been very painful. Even though we were expecting her death (she’d had  ovarian cancer for 10 years), and had the luxury of saying goodbye, and  putting things in order before she died. It was still hard when the  final day came.</p>
</div>
<p>Mum was a beautiful, loving person, who always thought of others  before herself. Even when we were planning her funeral and thanksgiving  services together, she was more worried about where people would park in  the town centre, than it being the right place to have the service!</p>
<h3>Throwing Out</h3>
<p>We did a lot of clearing out Mum’s things very early on. I spent a  lot of last summer driving up and down the M6 to clear Mum’s clothes and  her craft shed. She was a fanatical crafter and flower arranger. We  all loved her for her generosity and the beautiful things she made. But  we had so much stuff we held a sale in the Village Hall in aid of  MacMillan Cancer last September.</p>
<p>The ladies from Mum’s WI did the coffee and cakes, and the family and  friends set up stall (literally, I took my shop equipment down to be  able to display things well), and we sent over £750 to MacMillan!</p>
<p>It was painful to see so much stuff, but other people were able to  get benefit from it, so it was right to do it. Mum’s beautiful clothes –  so many of them, and remembering her wearing them was painful, but also  happy. Remembering the events she wore them at…..happy times.</p>
<h3>Life Goes On</h3>
<p>Mum wanted us all to get on with our lives. Easy for her to say! We  were the ones grieving. She left a big hole. Who do I ring when I don’t  know how to do something? Who do I turn to when something goes wrong? I  also miss the general, silly chats. Those 10 conversations in a day when  you keep remembering things to say about the children, business,  friends.</p>
<p>She told Dad to find someone else to share his life with. At the time  Dad was insistent that it would take time to replace Mum. But, he’s  been seeing a lady since September, and they are good companions to each  other. She’s not a replacement for Mum, but he’s happy, even though he  misses Mum. I can’t say that it’s been easy for me to accept, but  knowing he is not alone does help me.</p>
<p>I’ve managed to start focusing more on the business. The year before  Mum died was the worst roller-coaster I’ve ever been on. Where were my  priorities? On a small business struggling in the recession, or time  with my Mum? I chose time with my Mum, to the detriment of my business. I  don’t regret it, but there is so much to do.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been easy to refocus, and the emotional pain of not having  Mum to talk to about plans, or share successes has been difficult. But,  I’ve been helped immensely by the support of excellent friends, the  prayers from people from my Church, and more recently from 3 Reiki  sessions.</p>
<p>I’d never had Reiki before, but Mum’s death had put me out of kilter. Reiki has helped to get my body and spirit  back in line (Reiki is about energy through the body and with the  world). It has also helped me believe that Mum is still with me in  spirit. I knew that her spirit would live on – it’s a big part of my  Christian belief. But it’s only since talking to Bernadette, my Reiki  Master, that this has totally come home. Now I can feel Mum’s spirit  with me, and I’m happier than I’ve been in a very long time.</p>
<p>Th<a rel="nofollow" href="http://support4women.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/3131897.jpg"><img class="alignleft" title="_3131897" src="http://support4women.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/3131897-150x150.jpg" alt="Family planting trees in Mum's memory - March 2010" width="150" height="150" /></a>is weekend was a tough one for us. It’s the start of half term  week, and Dad had offered to look after the boys for us. He’s taking them to Legoland  tomorrow – their Christmas present. But when we arrived late Friday  night, 10 minutes after my brother and his 2 girls, it was clear that  Dad was struggling with the emotions of it all.</p>
<p>He was struggling with the emotions “what should I be feeling”. He  felt guilty that he has got on with his life, that he is happy with his  life. It took all weekend of being with his children and grandchildren,  doing ‘normal’ things to make him understand that it’s fine to be happy.  Mum wouldn’t want it any other way.</p>
<p>So, one year on, and I miss my Mum. But not like I did. I miss being  able to share with her the boy’s triumphs, my ideas for the business,  and my plans for the garden. But, as my Christian belief tells me – Life  goes on. When one life is taken away, babies are born, and the life  cycle starts again.</p>
<p>We’ll never forget the people we love so much, or their love for us.  We just need to work out the best way of moving forward without them.  There is no right way or wrong way to grieve. No right or wrong time to  start clearing out. But the only right way forward is to let their  spirit go free. That way it comes back to support you with even more  passion than it did in life.</p>
<p>I’m happier, calmer, more focused and able to enjoy life so much more  than I have for a number of years. I hope you can be too.</p>

<p><em>Greening your lifestyle needn&#8217;t be hard work if you choose to involve the whole family. Here, Green writer Brenda Cuby shares some quick ideas for making some small steps towards a greener home.</em></p>
<p><strong>Adventures</strong> – Plan family days, these do not need to cost much money, you can go for a walk in your local area, plan a treasure hunt, make a picnic, go on a bike ride, the list is endless all you need is a bit of imagination.</p>
<p><strong>Ban the batteries</strong> – Kids will soon get used to toys without batteries when they see the great alternatives.  You can get solar powered, wind-up and traditional toys which need no battery power to work.  If you do have some battery toys then try and use rechargeable batteries where possible.</p>
<p><strong>Cooking</strong> – The more involved  you can get your child in cooking from a young age the better it is for them.  They learn to be self-sufficient as adults, they learn how to make traditional dishes and generally you will find they will take so much pride in their cooking that they will want to eat it!</p>
<p><strong>Craft Box </strong>– Get crafty!  Kids love to create so why not have a box which you can fill up with all the rubbish you would normally throw away including toilet rolls, old cards etc, so when you have a rainy day or a day where the kids are bored you can just delve in and start creating your masterpieces.</p>
<p><strong>Energy Saving</strong> – When planning your children’s chore list for their pocket money why not make them responsible for some energy saving ideas, which can include: switching off lights when leaving a room, switching off television’s and computers at the socket not just leaving them on standby.</p>
<p><strong>Gardening</strong> – Whether you have a garden or not, you can get the family started from a young age enjoying growing your own.  A great form of exercise and spending time with the kids if you do have an allotment of large garden, the excitement the kids and you as adults feel when you grow your own is contagious and you will find that kids are more inclined to try the vegetables they grow!</p>
<p><strong>Recycling</strong> – Make this a family chore.  Each family member should be responsible for a different type of recycling.  Depending on what recycling pick-ups your council facilitates will depend on what you do, but the usual ones include: paper, garden waste, glass, and food waste.</p>
<p><strong>Togetherness</strong> – The most important thing is time!  No matter what you have materially or not, children need your time, whether it is just for a cuddle or reading a book or playing a game these are the memories your child will carry with them throughout their lives. Material things will come and go but the more time you spend together doing fun and enjoyable activities together the more happier you all will be!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mymiddleyouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/lavender_honeycakes.jpg.display.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-572" title="lavender_honeycakes.jpg.display" src="http://www.mymiddleyouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/lavender_honeycakes.jpg.display.jpg" alt="Lavender honey cupcakes" width="300" height="264" /></a>I came across this perfect cupcake recipe online and though it too good not to share. I think its a great variation on the usual cup cake recipes, and, as I&#8217;m such a lavender fan, I&#8217;ll be baking these again, later in the year with lavender from my own garden.</p>
<p>Lavender has an aromatic sharpness, which, combined with soft flavours of the honey and the toasted almonds give these cupcakes a luxuriously decadent and intense flavour.</p>
<p>I think a sprig of real lavender would make the perfect topping.</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<p>Vanilla cupcakes:<br />
280 g sifted plain flour<br />
1 tsp baking powder<br />
Pinch of salt<br />
113g unsalted butter, softened<br />
205g Tate &amp; Lyle fair-trade caster sugar<br />
2 large eggs, at room temperature<br />
4 floz whole milk<br />
1/2 teaspoon good vanilla extract</p>
<p><strong>Method:</strong></p>
<p><em>Makes 13</em></p>
<p>Preheat oven to 180ºc<br />
Sift together flour, salt and baking powder in a small bowl.<br />
In a large mixing bowl, beat the butter with an electric mixer until  smooth. Add caster sugar and beat for 5 minutes until very light and  fluffy.<br />
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating to combine after each addition.  Add the flour mixture in three parts, alternating with the milk and  vanilla, beginning and ending with the flour.<br />
Be careful not to over mix.<br />
Using an ice cream scoop, spoon the batter into cupcake liners &#8211; about  3/4 full.<br />
Bake for 20 mins or until a toothpick inserted into the centre comes  out clean.<br />
Cool the cupcakes in the pan for a few minutes then transfer to a wire  rack and allow to cool completely.</p>
<p><strong>For the frosting:</strong></p>
<p>Lily Vanilli Lavender Honey Icing<br />
50g soft butter<br />
450g Tate &amp; Lyle Fairtrade icing sugar (approx – depending on the  consistency you want to achieve)<br />
3fl oz lavender milk<br />
1fl oz double cream<br />
1 tsp honey<br />
Flaked almonds and lavender and edible silver glitter to decorate</p>
<p>Toast flaked almonds on a baking sheet in a hot oven for approx 5 mins –  until lightly browned &#8211; and allow to cool.</p>
<p>Whisk butter in a metal bowl until smooth, then add 300g icing sugar,  milk, honey &amp; double cream. Blend until smooth and slowly add  remaining icing sugar until you have the consistency you want.</p>
<p>Ice cupcakes and dust with a sprinkling of lavender buds, cooled  toasted almonds and silver glitter.</p>
<p><strong>For the lavender milk: </strong></p>
<p>Measure out around 1.5 times the milk your recipe requires (to allow  for evaporation) and add lavender buds at a ratio of 2tbsp buds to 1 cup  milk to a small pan.<br />
Heat ingredients to a scald stage (just before boiling), then turn off  heat and leave to cool completely. Strain the flowers with a sieve and  re-measure milk before adding to your recipe.</p>
<p>Edible glitter is available from cake shops and online baking retailers</p>

It&#8217;s based on the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1856269051?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=middleyouth-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1856269051" target="_self">Beauty Steals</a> book and means that you can download the best-rated beauty bargains onto your Iphone for shopping and in some cases, ordering direct from your phone.The Beauty Bible series is edited by Jo Fairley and Sarah Stacey, who use a large panel of &#8220;real women&#8221; to road test and review beauty products for their coolhunting beauty book series.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually a Beauty Bible tester, and have contributed to the <a rel="nofollow" href="&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1856268519?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=middleyouth-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1856268519" target="_self">Green Beauty Bible</a> and the <a rel="nofollow" title="Handbag Beauty Bible" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1856266192?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=middleyouth-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=19450&amp;creativeASIN=1856266192" target="_self">Handbag Beauty bible</a>, plus another I&#8217;m currently testing products for, so I was very interested in trying the app out for myself.  The app is easy to use, you can opt to view by beauty category or by A-Z of products. If you click through to the product view you get a brief description, the Beauty Bible marks out of 10 (from the testing panel), price and tester comments. You can then click through in some cases to buy straight away online or discover the bricks and mortar stockist. The app includes best buys for make up, skincare, body and hair products. You can also &#8220;favorite&#8221; the ones you like.</p>
<p>This app is perfectly suited to the Beauty Steals book (top performing bargain beauty products).  For me, it&#8217;s great for those moments in Boots when I&#8217;m away from home, have forgotten some beauty product and need to buy something decent on the spot but not top dollar.</p>
<p>At £2.99 for an app, it is a little pricey as you can buy the Beauty Steals book itself for a shade under six quid, but like all apps, you&#8217;re paying for the convenience of having the information you need at your fingertips.</p>
<p><strong>Beauty Steals Iphone app &#8211; £2.99 at the Apple store.</strong></p>

<p>Most of Ruby Plum&#8217;s garments use tie belts  or ties which you can wrap round your body where it suits you best. I&#8217;m a massive fan of wrap dresses because these suit my body shape best and I&#8217;m pleased to report that Suzy uses this style of dress throughout her collection.</p>
<p>Wrap dresses work well when they are tied under your bust or around your waist, at the back or at the front with a nice floppy bow to flatter your tummy. Even the cardis and coats have belts and no other fastenings so that you can tie them to get exactly the right fit. Many of the clothes in the collection also feature kimono style sleeves which aga=in are very flattering and easy to wear. All the clothes have been tested on “real” women &#8211; not skinny teenagers &#8211; of all shapes, sizes and ages, even pregnant women have been able to wear the collection.</p>
<p>The bes<a href="http://www.mymiddleyouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/nina_detail3_450.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail  wp-image-478" title="nina_detail3_450" src="http://www.mymiddleyouth.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/nina_detail3_450-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>t news too is that in an industry plagued with questionable environmental practices and labour issues, Ruby Plum is striving to leave a lighter footprint on our planet. They use  environmentally-friendly processes and materials  wherever possible, minimise transportation distances and use sea  rather than the faster air shipping. They also treat their workers fairly.  They&#8217;re a member of the Ethical Fashion Forum too.</p>
<p>The biggie &#8211; the actual clothes sizes &#8211; were a happy surprise: from size eight right up to eighteen. The adjustability of the clothes makes them a good buy if you fluctuate between sizes too.</p>
<p>The collection is designer, so the prices are more than you may normally pay, but reasonable for clothing of this quality and design. My only gripe is that some need to be dry-cleaned or hand-washed.</p>
