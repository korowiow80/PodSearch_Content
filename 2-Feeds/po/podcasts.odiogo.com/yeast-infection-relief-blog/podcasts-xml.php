<p><em>Acidophillus</em> is vital to prevent the reproduction of pathogenic bacteria in the digestive tract. It acts as a natural antibiotic and prevents the body from having bowel, vaginal and urinary tract infections.</p>
<p>Moreover, it also inhibits respiratory and parasitic infections. <em>Acidophillus</em> also helps improve digestion and absorption of food. Also, it helps normalize the level of cholesterol and reduce the risk of colon cancer</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-indent: 1.27cm;">For those who develop a yeast infection, or <a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/yeast-infection-relief/intestinal-candida/" target="_blank">candida</a><strong>, skin</strong> tends to be scaly, red &amp; inflamed. That is among the first stage symptoms.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; text-indent: 1.27cm;">Candidiasis generally occurs in moist skin parts or mucous membranes. Small wonder even babies get it. Keeping babies diaper area clean is therefore crucial. Wearing very tight, synthetic undergarments; poor hygienic habits; certain medical conditions necessitating medications, like diabetes are some of the things that leads to <strong>Candida skin</strong> infection.</p>

Application of apple cider vinegar into your bath water is also beneficial. It helps alleviate the itching of the external skin. Drink lots of water.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify">You can try applying oregano oil, because like garlic, it gives comfort. Limit your intake of antibiotics; stop all together if you are already well. Do not douche because it&#8217;ll only disturb the pH of the vagina which could lead to multiplication of bacteria and yeast. Do not wear tight fitting clothes and wear clothes made of cotton.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Though women are the most affected,  the infection may be experienced by babies as well in women and specially in vaginal area but these are also commonly found in men and babies too. A baby taking antibiotics (or being nursed by a mother taking antibiotics) has high susceptibility to yeast infections. It is important to always keep the diaper area clean.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">There are other things that may increase the likelihood of women getting a <a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/yeastinfectionomore">yeast infection</a>, like frequent douching and use of harsh soaps around the delicate vaginal area, wearing tight-fitting synthetic underwear, and a penchant for sugary and yeasty foods.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify">It is harmless most of the time but if the body&#8217;s resistance is weak and the immune system&#8217;s shield lowers down, and then there is a big chance this fungus will grow and multiply. As they say, too much of any thing is a bad thing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify">It is important, however to undergo tests to determine what type of Candida rash you may have; for every kind, there is a different approach to treatment.</p>

It can be treated with ketoconazole, Nystatin and the like that are available over the counter. Also inspect other <a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/yeastinfectionomore" target="_blank">yeast infections</a> such as oral thrush and the like.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify">It is also best to manage and control your diet and personal hygiene that will help lessen your chances of having it or, if you do have it, at least lessen the symptoms discomfort.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.42cm; text-indent: 1.27cm;">Try some anti-<strong>candida recipes</strong> that will not only add variety to your regular meals but also offer tremendous health-boosting nutrients.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.42cm; text-indent: 1.27cm;">Limit intake of sugar and refined carbohydrates. Steamed vegetables, with nutrients still intact, are among the recommended items. Note that improving your glucose tolerance can help manage chronic candidiasis.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.42cm; text-indent: 1.27cm;">Whip up anti-<a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/yeast-infection-relief/intestinal-candida/" target="_blank">candida</a> recipes that include fresh ingredients like antioxidant-rich strawberries and heart-healthy oats and probiotics like yogurt. Try mashing strawberries, and mix in yogurt and stevia. Or opt for a mashed banana with one-half-cup of raw oats sprinkled with some cinnamon. Steamed cabbage with cooked ground beef sprinkled with olive oil, or steamed spinach with ground turkey cooked in a skillet are also good recipes for better health.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0.49cm; margin-bottom: 0.49cm;" align="justify">When it is found on parts such as the mouth, these are called mouth thrush or moniliasis. When in antibiotic therapy, it weakens the body&#8217;s resistance and immune system at the same time. This results to multiplication of the fungus.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0.42cm; text-indent: 1.27cm;">This condition may proliferate if not effectively controlled, resulting to chronic vaginal yeast infections, not to mention mental distress and an overall unhealthy feeling.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.42cm; text-indent: 1.27cm;">It is highly recommended to get tested for <a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Systemic Candida</strong> </a>if you are constantly feeling constipated or if you experience oral thrush or bouts with diarrhea, flatulence and itchiness of the rectum.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.42cm; text-indent: 1.27cm;">To prevent your condition from recurring, know the factors upsetting the balance between good and bad bacteria in the digestive tract and vagina, like intake of antibiotics or contraceptives. Taking mutivitamins, good hygiene, getting sufficient sleep and eating a half cup of live culture yogurt daily also help support normal intestinal flora.</p>

<p>Some of the main causes of this condition have been found to be birth control medication, steroids and antibiotic use. One of the main natural treatments for yeast infection has been to look at one&#8217;s diet and ensure that the correct foods are being eaten.</p>
<p>It has been found through research that  sugar (and sugar-rich foods) promotes yeast growth. Therefore it follows that by decreasing  the intake of sugar will  help decrease yeast level in the body. It has also been discovered that eating yogurt will help decrease the amount of <a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/yeastinfectionomore" target="_blank">yeast infection </a>in the body.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The human body is naturally composed of harmful and friendly bacteria. The body needs to keep them in balance to stay healthy. There are two common reasons for the bad ones to dominate one area of the body: overuse of antibiotics and poor nutrition.</p>
<p>Too much intake of broad spectrum antibiotics kills the good bacteria and even some bad bacteria. This can cause the overgrowth of<a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/" target="_blank"> Candida</a>.  Also, antibiotics enter the body through the animal products that we eat such as meat, milk and cheese.</p>
<p>This is because the animals that people eat are regularly fed with antibiotics. On the other hand, when the body doesn&#8217;t receive enough vitamins and minerals, the human body becomes more prone to bacteria and viruses.</p>

Medicated creams or suppositories and antibiotics prescribed by a doctor may alleviate the signs &amp; symptoms, but unless you make some lifestyle and dietary modifications, yeast infection may reappear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Medicines can give quick relief, but sometimes the <a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/yeastinfectionomore" target="_blank">yeast infection </a>is only temporarily treated and returns, in which case the afflicted can go for homeopathic/natural remedies.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">Nutritional immunity builders, like taking the recommended daily dosage of vitamin C, through fruits like oranges, bell pepper, strawberries, and lemon juice or through supplements, are important. Maintain good hygiene and watch what you eat. Say no to sugary foods that feed candida, as well as yeasty foods like pizza and beer. Veer away also from aged foodstuff like smoked meats.</p>

First, eating should be at least 3 times a day but with little or no snacks, especially sweets. If you need to eat in between meals, you should go for veggies or nuts.</p>
<p>Typical Candida diet meals are composed of meat, veggies and small portion of complex carbohydrates. The largest portion of a meal should be meat. The servings of meat and vegetables should almost be equal. For meat options, you may have ground buffalo, turkey or beef. It is also good to go for beef or chicken patties.</p>
<p>In chicken, be sure to choose the breast or the thigh part. Steaming is the best and recommended way to prepare your vegetables to retain the essential nutrients.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the natural balance between the bad and the good bacteria is disrupted, an infection may occur. Yeasts can cause <a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/yeast-infection-relief/vaginal-yeast-infection-symptoms/" target="_blank">vaginal infection </a>or oral thrush.</p>
<p>The superficial symptoms, such as itchiness and rashes can easily disappear with medication but some infection can be very invasive and enter the bloodstream. The main goal is to stop the growth of <a href="http://www.yeastinfectionreliefblog.com/yeast-infection-relief/candida-albicans-causes/" target="_blank">Candida </a>in the system. To do this, you should watch your diet and avoid simple sugars and high glycemic foods.</p>
<p>Refined carbohydrates should also be eliminated to starve the bacteria. Drinking plenty of water and adding probiotics such as <em>Lactobacillus acidophilus</em>will also prevent recurring infection</p>
