<p>Did you know that you can become an affiliate marketer for peanuts and make a great income by building many niche targeted sites?</p>
<p>You sure can.  The internet is full of affiliate products and if you create a site, get it set up, get links to it and target your main keyword phrase you can be making money in no time.</p>
<p>Now lets say that one site you have makes you $5.00 per day from Adsense. That might not seem like much but if you have 15 or 20 niche sites you just built yourself an internet business income system that can run on autopilot!</p>
<p>So keep this ind when you are planning your next home based business idea.</p>

Take your <em>Micro Niche</em> and hire a freelance writer on http://www.elance.com or wherever you can find ghostwriters and create an ebook surrounding a particularly hot topic that surrounds your niche. Of if you would like to take on the task yourself. . . http://www.7dayebook.com</p>
<p>Go check out different forums and blogs that may be discussing the topic you wish to expose. You can do this by searching Wordpress blogs, Google blogs, Technorati, Ezinearticles.com, ArticleCity, Go Articles, Wikipedia etc.</p>
<p>Hang around and figure out what people are anxious and concerned about. This is KEY.  Or, you can take this and take it to the next level, and create products for a specific target market, and sell resell rights to the products to take home more money at the end of the day. You can even sell your ebook rights on eBay for a fixed amount.</p>
<p>Better yet, to balloon the idea, create multiple products you sell the rights to and bundle it all together in one sale.</p>
<p>There are many products out there that talk about how to create Private Label Rights products, should you desire to dig further.</p>

<p>No one says you have to stick to affiliate marketing to create an online gold mine without having a physical product.  Here&#8217;s what you can do:</p>
<p>Create a private membership site and (charge either a monthly fee or a yearly fee) around a particular topic that delivers a solution (preferably a long term solution).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy to set up a membership area that is all automated.  I use Sentrylogin.com which costs me $4.95 per month to have my site secure and they take care of processing my payments through Paypal.  That means that after you create your website, you then turn it into a membership site where people can register, get a password and login without you having to be at your computer 24/7.  You will want this all automated so you can focu on creating content for your members.</p>
<p>A great example of this is my http://www.businessideascenter.com membership site. In fact, the site delivers a specific solution to starting an online home based business and how that’s done.  The site does very well in a high competition market because it is unique and helps people solve a problem.  The site is filled with step-by-step videos, enormous value above and beyond the $99 membership fee.</p>
<p>And that goes without saying that you must deliver on your promise, and in most cases, OVER-DELIVER to people. And they will stay your loyal customer… for life!</p>

<p>In this series of making money on the internet here is a fantastic way to offer a service, if you will, because you are supplying all the information someone is looking for and are using ads to generate your income.<br />
Create an article site and monetize it with Pay-Per-Click traffic and Google Adsense preferably.</p>
<p>You could collect articles from a group of individuals within your topic of interest or start a larger more broad article directory that covers many topics, like http://www.ezinearticles.com If you click onto an article specific page at the link above, you’ll see Google Adsense on the page, and I believe the site owner of EzineArticles.com makes more in a<br />
day from Adsense than most people make in a month. Let’s just say to most people that figure is not even in the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>Once you establish a hot article directory, you’ll get some true love from Google as well as fuel more submissions from your all your authors and publishers.  Then, once you build visitors to the independent articles that get submitted, it’s<br />
just a matter of science in the percentage of people that click on a paid ad that generates a commission to simply increasing your traffic to increase your pay.</p>
<p>Don’t look at it as simple work – nothing really is.  Making money on the internet does take dedication, work and the right know-how.</p>

<strong>#4 Way to Profit from your Niche Business Idea:</strong></p>
<p>First, look through the Database of Ideas in the members section of the Business Ideas Center and find a topic that interests you.  Get your keywords from the list.</p>
<p>Then find experts in that field that interests you, fully research the field, topic or product, whatever it is you wish to represent, and interview known and respected experts on tape over the phone.</p>
<p>Take those audio recordings, and combine in with a sort of “how-to-solve a problem theme” and you’ve got a physical product of CDs to sell to the target market.</p>
<p>And it is a well known fact since the initial slew of internet marketing products that came out, audio and physical CD products have a much higher value over a digital downloadable product. I know it myself from experiencing receipt of a physical product and I kinda do put a higher value on the physical audio product versus ebooks and digital downloads.</p>
<p>Don’t you?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started thinking about how I got to where I am today and how my online business ideas company is basically all centered around that and I thought it would be fun to share some of my &#8220;what NOT to do&#8221; pieces of advice with you!  I have a few (hundred) that are pretty scary but might be helpful to you guys who are starting out with your online business ideas and who are trying not to make costly and sometimes deadly mistakes.  </p>
<p>I learned these from trial and error because I just didn&#8217;t have the knowledge of how to do things and I couldn&#8217;t afford to hire a firm to do this stuff for me.  And to be honest with you, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t or I never would have learned as much as I did.  But I did spend a lot of money over the years trying new products that turned out to be rotten eggs.  Who knew!  So here goes&#8230;</p>
<p>One time I hired an SEO company called Beranked#1 to get me on the first page of the search results for a keyword phrase I was trying for which was pretty competitive but they told me no problem.  I didn&#8217;t know much about keyword phrases back then or how to find them so I thought that if I hired a company that said they could get me on the first page of Google for my keyword then  why not?  I never made it to the first page of Google for some loophole they had that said you would get on page one but not when.  That cost me 100.00 bucks a month from what I remember.  I canceled that pretty damn fast.</p>
<p>I tried my hand at paying another SEO company to get me on page one.  They too told me I could get ranked for my keyword phrase.  That was 900.00 over 3 months.  STUPID.  You&#8217;d think I would have learned from the first time but no, I thought I would give it a second chance. </p>
<p>If you are thinking of paying someone who claims they can get you to page one of the search engines for your keyword think again&#8230;please!  You&#8217;ll just be throwing your money away.</p>
<p>I can also recall paying an SEO company to submit my online home business to hundreds of websites a month.  I think that was only about 150.00 a year but was worthless.  It did nothing I couldn&#8217;t do myself for next to nothing in cost.  </p>
<p>Something else that I remember doing is not understanding that I needed to find a hungry market BEFORE I went out and invented some cool new product.  I tried to create an Angel Registry thinking it was the coolest thing ever and not one single person was &#8220;Googling&#8221; that or anything like it so it sank to the bottom of the internet ocean.  You must have people searching for what you are selling.  You must know what your keywords are going to be in order to get traffic.  It&#8217;s that simple.</p>
<p>My last what-not-to-do story was not following my instincts.  I was so desperate to make a living online that I was pretty much paying for every $47.00 dollar deal that came my way.  I believed every email I got saying that their product would save me from disaster and I too would own cars and boats like they showed on their website.  Please understand that MLM (multi level marketing) can be very spammy.  Follow your gut and go for something that looks a whole lot more realistic.  Look for a company that tells you UP FRONT what you are going to be doing so you don&#8217;t get taken for a ride.</p>
<p>So my friends, you&#8217;ll make mistakes along the way but rest assured you will learn from them!  Keep plugging away at getting your backlinks from high PR sites, keep posting to your blog for fresh content and keep social marketing.  It will happen!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Play to Your Strengths &#8211; You&#8217;ll hear this from many gurus in the field of internet marketing and for the most part I agree with it.  </p>
<p>When my clients become members and start searching through the database of ideas for a product they are interested in promoting as an affiliate, of course they are going to be drawn to something they are familiar with.  Who wouldn&#8217;t be?</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s okay to go outside of your comfort zone!  In fact, I suggest looking at some of the other interesting topics with lots of keywords that have great traffic and learning about the topic in which you have chosen.  Stretch yourself a little.  Do some research and see if you become interested in what you are researching.  You may surprise yourself.  You may also hit upon a huge hungry market.  </p>
<p>The key is finding what <strong><em>other </em></strong>people want; not necessarily with what you know.  </p>
<p>When you start a work from home business be sure you explore all avenues of what is &#8220;hot&#8221; by looking at the amount of possible keyword phrases in the market.  No one says you have to limit yourself to what you know.  You can certainly become an expert on other topics.</p>
<p>Have fun with your entrepreneur ideas and play to your strengths and weaknesses!</p>

      <description>My friends at Market Samurai have this to say about the 3 Unbreakable golden rules of seo!

The Fact: 90% Of All Keywords Have NO Traffic – Therefore, You Must ONLY Target Keywords with Significant Traffic To Warrant Investing Any Time or Effort In.
The Risk: Break This Rule And You’ll Never Attract Any Significant [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/business-ideas-center/Business_Ideas_Center-The_3_UNBREAKABLE_Golden_Rules_of_SEO.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><span style="font-size: small;"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-509" style="margin: 6px;" title="3 Unbreakable rules to seo" src="http://www.businessideascenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/market-samurai-image.gif" alt="3 Unbreakable rules to seo" width="106" height="129" />My friends at Market Samurai have this to say about the 3 Unbreakable golden rules of seo!<br />
</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Golden Rule #1:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Fact: </span></strong>90% Of All Keywords Have NO Traffic – Therefore, You Must ONLY Target Keywords with Significant Traffic To Warrant Investing Any Time or Effort In.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Risk: </span></strong>Break This Rule And You’ll Never Attract Any Significant Traffic… And You Will FAIL.</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Golden Rule #2:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Fact: </span></strong>Many Keywords With Traffic Have Little Commercial Value (“Tire Kicker” Keywords) – Therefore, You Must ONLY Target Keywords With Significant PROFIT POTENTIAL.<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Risk: </span></strong>Break This Rule And You’ll Only Attract “Browsers” NOT “Buyers”, And You’ll Unknowingly Select The Low Profit “Dog” Keywords, when for the SAME EFFORT You&#8217;ll Be Picking Keywords With 5, 10 Even 100 Times the Profit Potential! Clearly, If You Ignore This Golden Rule… You Will FAIL!</span></span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Golden Rule #3: </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Fact:</span></strong> Unfortunately, for Most Marketers, 90% Of Most Keywords Are Simply TOO COMPETITIVE To Rank Page #1 For…  &#8211; You Must ONLY Target Keywords That Have “Acceptable Competition” – That You Can REALISTICALLY RANK FOR!<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Risk:</span></strong> You Need To Have A Systematic, Analytical Way To Analyze Your Competition (Like the “4-Phase” Competition Approach That Market Samurai Provides), Otherwise You’ll Have No Chance of Ranking At All&#8230; And You Will FAIL</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva;"><span style="font-size: small;">As always, we use Market Samurai to find these little gem keywords quickly and easily.  To learn how to build and promote a #1 home based business around your keyword (or any other niche you’re interested in) visit <a title="Business Ideas Center" rel="external" href="http://www.businessideascenter.com">The Business Ideas Center</a>.</span></span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-478" style="margin: 6px;" title="Micro Niche to a #1 Home Based Business" src="http://www.businessideascenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/microniche1-300x299.jpg" alt="Micro Niche to a #1 Home Based Business" width="270" height="269" />Drilling down to a #1 Home Based Business</h2>
<p>As you know I am all about niches and finding keywords that people can use to build their own online home based business in affiliate marketing.  We do this in The Business Ideas Center with niches and micro-niches and you can too.</p>
<p>Micro niches are even more drilled down keywords in a market.  For example, lets say your main topic is saxophone.  Then you could drill down the keyword piano to get a niche in that idea such as Tenor Saxophone.  But here is where you can take it a step further and drill down Tenor Saxophones to get How to play the Saxophone.</p>
<p>So your micro niche would most likely have longer keyword phrases and be a bit more specific in what it is.  Your keywords would also have less competition but you want to remember to make sure there is still a decent amount of traffic.</p>
<p>It won&#8217;t do you any good to have low competition if there is no traffic!</p>
<p>So when you begin your search for a niche try to boil it down to the deepest root that you can go still having traffic that would make it worth your while to promote this keyword phrase in your market.</p>
<p>Affiliate marketers have the best internet business when they focus of a keyword phrase they know has been drilled down to find low competition but high traffic.  It can be done!</p>

      <description>Did you know that the # 1 Home Based Business in the world is affiliate marketing?  Probably!  But do you know how to go out and successfully start your own affiliate marketing campaign with the right keywords, the right products and the right selling technique?  Maybe not.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-468" style="margin: 6px;" title="#1 Home Based Business Idea" src="http://www.businessideascenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/j0403669-200x300.jpg" alt="#1 Home Based Business Idea" width="140" height="210" />Did you know that the # <strong>1 Home Based Business</strong> in the world is affiliate marketing?  Probably!  But do you know how to go out and successfully start your own affiliate marketing campaign with the right keywords, the right products and the right selling technique?  Maybe not.</p>
<p>(This is what my clients do through The Business Ideas Center except the first 3 are done for them with the database of ideas/products/keywords.)  However if you were to do this on your own the process would be as follows.  I want to give you a breakdown of what you can expect to be doing when you start your home based business.</p>
<p>1. First you should have an idea of something that interests you that you think you would be good at talking about.  For example if you love playing the violin you may want to focus on this idea to see if there is a viable market.  Pick an idea you like and start seeing if there is a niche for it.</p>
<p>2. You&#8217;ll need to do some major keyword research on your idea to find out what the traffic is like, what the competition is like and what short and long tail keywords are available.  You&#8217;ll want your traffic to be at least 100 searches per day in the top position at Google for your keyword phrase match and with less than 60,000 competing web pages on a broad match.</p>
<p>3. You&#8217;ll then need to find affiliate products online that you are interested in promoting based on your keyword research.  You&#8217;ll be in your micro-niche at this point if you have drilled down far enough into your niche to really get a good product with low keyword competition and decent traffic.  You can use the top affiliate sites or simply search for other micro affiliate programs for your niche.</p>
<p>4. Then you&#8217;ll need to create a domain name and get a hosting plan.  This is easy and I highly recommend Hostgator for your hosting company.  You can get the baby plan and add as many sites to your account as you like this way.</p>
<p>5. Create your site with the best web 2.0 tools which means you need to get a blog!</p>
<p>6. Add your content (posts) to the blog with your affiliate products that you want to promote.  Be sure you add a privacy policy too.</p>
<p>7. Submit your site to the search engines, blog directories, RSS directories and social bookmarking sites.</p>
<p>8. Write content daily in your blog using your keyword phrase and sub keyword phrases.</p>
<p>9. Write articles and submit them to the article directories using your keyword phrase and remember to only put your anchor text in the author bio box.  Bookmark this once you have been approved.</p>
<p>10. Create additional sites through Hubpages, Squidoo and Twitter and start your social marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Now, here is the key&#8230;you want to be sure you write daily in your blog while you are starting out so that the search engines notice you and realize you are adding fresh content to your site.  If you want a # <em>1 Home Based Business</em> to work for you, you&#8217;ll have to do the work daily for it.  But the returns will be fantastic.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know there are a lot of moms out there searching the web looking for a home based business idea so that they can stay home and raise their kids and still earn an income.  I did the same thing for years while I stayed home with my younger daughter.  I needed to make enough money to help pay my bills but I also wanted to stay home.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t make sense for me to go back to a job that only made it possible to pay the daycare expenses of a newborn.  And in my town of Marlborough the cost for daycare for a newborn was 350.00 per week.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t see doing that.  I just wanted to be home with my baby.  (And of course make some money so my husband didn&#8217;t kill me!)</p>
<p>So now that I run a successful company I want to invite moms who want to stay home and find a profitable, safe, legitimate way to <a href="http://www.businessideascenter.com">make money online</a> to see what they can do with the Business Ideas Center.  See how affiliate marketing can be profitable while you are in total control over it.  You can easily create your new business and promote online products from companies like Amazon.com and Google and Clickbank.  No scams.  No lies.  Just real ideas, products and keywords, training videos, real companies and real businesses.  This is for women all over the world that want to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>And I am always available to help them.  I am not lounging on my 75 foot yacht in the Caribbean or sitting on my island oasis.  I am sitting in my home office writing this and in just a few weeks I&#8217;ll be putting my 2nd grader on the bus for school.</p>
<p>Now that&#8217;s what I call paradise!<a title="School Bus" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21484712@N00/3708011885/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2612/3708011885_c6e75e820b_m.jpg" border="0" alt="School Bus" width="240" height="160" /></a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you finish your new home based small business you are going to want to create backlinks to your site in order to rank better in the search engines.  So how do you go about doing that?  Google is looking to see how you are doing it too so please be careful when thinking about this.</p>
<p>There are linking farms out there that you can pay to get backlinks but they are typically black hat so it&#8217;s best to stay away from them.  You want to create natural or organic backlinks and to do so may take some time on your part but trust me, you won&#8217;t get knocked out of ranking from Google.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways I create one way backlinks to my own sites.  I find related sites that I can leave comments on with my web site address and I actually read the comments and put my opinion in.  Don&#8217;t be spammy here.  Seriously take a few minutes and read what people are talking about and become an expert in your field and offer your opinion.</p>
<p>Another way I get back links is by creating additional pages in Squidoo and Hubpages and adding your links to your websites from there.  It&#8217;s easy and keeping it up to date only takes a few minutes a day.  You&#8217;ll like the links.</p>
<p>Also I create a podcast for my site and submit it to the podcast directories.  You can also join blog carnivals and get great backlinks that way.  Start bookmarking your posts too!</p>
<p>So really do some work and get those natural backlinks you need.  It will be well worth your time in the long run.  You want to create a <a href="http://www.businessideascenter.com">money making internet business</a> without it being banished from Google.</p>

      <description>Absolutely!
In fact, I would highly recommend it.  And that is to get yourself into affiliate marketing where you have complete control over what you will be promoting and for whom.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-447" style="margin: 6px;" title="surveys" src="http://www.businessideascenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/j0427676.jpg" alt="surveys" width="154" height="232" />Absolutely!</p>
<p>In fact, I would highly recommend it.  And that is to get yourself into affiliate marketing where you have complete control over what you will be promoting and for whom.</p>
<p>You see, the problem with taking surveys is that you are reliant upon the companies sending you a survey that is geared toward your age, race, sex, interests etc.  I am a 45 year old  married woman with kids and because of my age I rarely would get surveys.  If the companies are not sending you any surveys there is no money.  The money is small so you would need to take a lot of surveys to even make any amount of money and that is going to be a total time hog.</p>
<p>Instead of spending all your time taking surveys which in reality is limited by how many hours in a day you can spend online and how many surveys you are sent, why not build an empire of your own that will eventually run on it&#8217;s own so you can keep building it up?  Why not be in total control of your time and energy!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, in order to run your own affiliate business you will need an idea, a product(s), a domain name, a hosting company, a blog and the rest is getting your site out there with targeted keywords and by building organic links.  Sure this may sound confusing to someone just starting out but there are many resources to help you do this.  Okay, we are THE resource to help you do all of what I just said!</p>
<p>Affiliate marketing is a billion dollar business and it works.  And it&#8217;s easy to do.  Here at the Business Ideas Center that&#8217;s all we do is <a href="http://www.businessideascenter.com">affiliate marketing</a>.  We give our members ideas that are marketable, we show them what affiliate products they could promote through the top 4 affiliate marketing companies and the keywords they need to use to promote the products.  This puts our members in complete control over what they want to earn commissions from and how many companies they want to promote.  Basically the sky is the limit. We even show them with our video training library how to choose a domain name, hosting company and how to set up their blog.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to be more than you can imagine!  Taking surveys may be great for someone wanting a little extra cash at the end of the month for a decent chunk of their time but if you are truly looking to build a home based business than DO IT.</p>
<p>So here is my recommendation &#8211; forget the surveys and start your own business.  It&#8217;s cheap to start and unlimited in potential!</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t fully understand what RSS was and what to do with it until I played around with my blog and started submitting it to the RSS sites.  So I want to see if perhaps I can help you understand what the heck RSS is!</p>
<p>I learn by seeing, you know&#8230;videos&#8230;live presentations&#8230;not by reading a manual.  And I pick it up quickly once I&#8217;ve seen it done so I made a video from my site to show you. &#8211; Hope this help!</p>

I have to say I feel the same way as he does at times!  But that could be because we don&#8217;t know what people want to talk about on Twitter.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough the following excerpt from Site Pro News helped me understand how to better use Twitter.  See if you can get a few tips from reading this!  I sure did.<br />
-Nadine<br />
_______________</p>
<p>&#8220;As you look around at those people who are successful building their own little communities on Twitter, you will notice that each one gives people what their Followers want.</p>
<p>For example, @cussy is an online marketer, and he has nearly 10,000 Followers. His secret to growth: quotes. He gives his followers some of the best quotes about business and reaching goals of anyone on Twitter. I follow him and Retweet him often.</p>
<p>@dave_carpenter advertises himself as a Success Partner For High Achievers. Dave shares quotes and tips, and he retweets others who give good advice also. More importantly, Dave encourages the people he follows. He has nearly 9,000 Followers at this time.</p>
<p>@MattLevenhagen is a professional marketer. His 13,000 Followers follow because he runs a mix of marketing tips, links to great articles, and retweets for great advice. He even uses his Twitter account to give his customer&#8217;s support.</p>
<p>@SocialMedia411 is a Social Media expert who offers social media tips, links to social media articles and news. With more than 56,000 Followers, you can bet that the advice given here is worthwhile to its audience.</p>
<p>When you learn to talk to the people most likely to buy from you, you have completed the first and most important step to enable you to develop strong Twitter Marketing habits.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of the best business opportunities are the one&#8217;s that won&#8217;t cost you thousands of dollars to start.</p>
<p>At the Business Ideas Center you can enroll for a year which allows you unlimited ideas with their keyword phrases already selected based on competition, traffic and marketability, plus you get all the training videos on how to set up your site and start promoting it. There is a resource section with hundreds of links and tools to help you work better.  Now this is all for $99.00 a year.  If you think about it, you could easily start 10 new businesses promoting affiliate products (which is a billion dollar empire) which would then be at an average cost of only 10 bucks.  So what is it worth to you?</p>
<p>Now if you were to try to do all of the above without any assistance you wouldn&#8217;t even know where to start.  It took my years and a whole lot of money to learn every trick I know and how to quickly and effectively get a site up and running.</p>
<p>The best business opportunity is also one that you are comfortable getting into and that means you should know what is involved and what is included.  If the site shows you pictures of the owners on their yachts and in front of their new cars don&#8217;t believe it.  They are playing with your head and it will be a scam. Please be careful with what you sign up for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Finally, there’s the issue with where you’re hosting your content &#8211; that “Buy Now” button or affiliate link.</p>
<p><strong>For the sake of God’s green earth, GET YOUR OWN DOMAIN!</strong></p>
<p>Relying on Squidoo, Hubpages, Facebook, WetPaint, whoever to host your “money page” is internet marketing SUICIDE.</p>
<p>Sites change their terms of service (Squidoo just did recently).  Your page can get banned.  The service might go down. The service might run out of money and die. Some asshat competitor might report you (even when you didn’t do anything wrong) and get your account deleted.  The service might decide to change their design or layout and it might kill your conversions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now it should come as no surprise that I am a huge proponent of having your own domain because you have all the control over it.  Michelle said it best above.  Get your own domain (I use <a href="http://secure.hostgator.com/cgi-bin/affiliates/clickthru.cgi?id=nade0213" target="_blank">Hostgator Web Hosting&#8217;s</a> Baby Plan) and let your website ideas start flowing.</p>

      <description>Let&amp;#8217;s first start with what a niche market is!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#8217;s first start with what a niche market is!</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia a niche market is the subset of the market on which a specific product is focusing on; Therefore the market niche defines the specific product features aimed at satisfying specific market needs, as well as the price range, production quality and the demographics that is intending to impact.</p>
<p>What that means is the niche is very specific and highly targeted.</p>
<p>Here is my example:  The category is weddings.  Now let&#8217;s find a nich in there.  You could have harpists that play for the ceremony of a wedding.  The harpist is targeted.  You could have a Justice of the Peace in your specific town.  The JP is targeted.  You could have florists who deliver for weddings.  And so on.  It is specific and not so generalized as &#8220;weddings&#8221;.</p>
<p>So when you begin your market research you want to drill down to a niche market so that you can identify your audience and what they are looking for.  It will make it much easier for you to find customers is you know exactly what they are looking for and a niche market takes care of that.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="file:///C:/Users/Nade/AppData/Local/Temp/moz-screenshot-1.jpg" alt="" /><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-406" title="google" src="http://www.businessideascenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/googleone.jpg" alt="googleone" width="150" height="60" />When you think of adding content to your new website idea what do you come up with?</p>
<p>For me, my business is centered around business ideas, marketing on the web, finding profitable niche markets for others to use and helping them get started with their own site and blog.</p>
<p>My site is built like this:  The main pages that you see are through my blog&#8217;s interface on Wordpress and I have a static front page that is the &#8220;home&#8221; page.  Then I have my blog which is where I post my new and fresh content almost every day.  When you first start out with your site you will want to be posting every day so that the search engines notice you!  But what are you going to write about?</p>
<p>Here is the trick &#8211; you need to know what keywords you are going to be targeting for your site and you are going to want to use combinations of those keyword phrases in your post titles and in the body of the post.</p>
<p>For example, lets say I sell engagement and wedding rings.  I know that after doing keyword research that some keyword phrases that people are searching for are, &#8220;platinum diamond engagement rings&#8221;, &#8220;14K gold diamond engagement rings&#8221;, &#8220;men&#8217;s platinum wedding band&#8221;, and &#8220;wedding band sets&#8221;.  So when I go to write a new post I would want to include in the title of the post the keyword phase that is being searched for.</p>
<p>This is where you will be writing new fresh content.  You could write about how to tell the quality of a &#8220;platinum diamond engagement ring, or you could write about the difference between 14k gold diamond engagement rings and 10K gold diamond engagement rings!  Do you see where I am going with this?</p>
<p>Use your keywords to create posts or content for people to read and become interested in what you are saying.  The search engines will love this and you will too!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Alerted by the scream, the intrepid photgrapher springs into action" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7762412@N08/3792735023/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 6px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2653/3792735023_7519d634dc_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Alerted by the scream, the intrepid photgrapher springs into action" width="240" height="180" /></a><br />
Most new and honest web owners want to take the correct route and earn top keyword rankings by providing good quality content that web users will actually find helpful and useful. They build links the natural way by offering viral link bait in the form of videos, ebooks, articles, reports&#8230; all branded with backlinks to their sites.</p>
<p>Gradually over time, these links will build up and your keyword rankings will go up in the search engines. People will find your content and bookmark it in all the social bookmark sites like Digg, Facebook, MySpace&#8230; and your rankings will climb even faster.</p>
<p>However, since keyword marketing has become extremely competitive, you do need a little help with achieving those top rankings. Over the years I have tested and used many keyword tools and I have listed some of the best ones below.</p>
<p>Internet Success Spider</p>
<p>One of the first keyword tools I ever used was <a href="http://www.grabthespider.com/" target="_blank">The Internet Success Spider </a>by Neil Shearing which is now free. The Spider is a very simple, yet powerful keyword tool because it shows you the major players in your keyword niche. It slowly works in the background to give you valuable information on your keywords. I realized very quickly, with online marketing (like most things in life) information is what separates the losers from the winners.</p>
<p>So once you have secured the top keywords you want to rank for, use the spider to start getting your site indexed.  Keep building those links too&#8230;that&#8217;s what will get your site to rank for the keywords you choose.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you trying to come up with an internet work at home job?  It isn&#8217;t easy sifting through the garbage and coming up with something that is honest huh?</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>In fact take a look at this email I received which I DID NOT click to open because it is a scam.  But unfortunately it is giving eBay a bad name.  You can make money on eBay but look at this guy&#8217;s promises.  He knows we are desperate to make money and he knows we have probably heard of eBay so he is giving us the impression of trust. </p>
<p>If you want to sell with eBay, go to eBay&#8217;s website and watch the free videos in the training sessions to learn the right way to sell on eBay so you don&#8217;t lose your money to a scam like this one below.<br />
__________________________</p>
<p><em>Ever heard of the eBay ca$h machine ?</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like an extra $250 &#8211; $1000 a week on eBay with 15 minutes of your time ?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made it my job to help people succeed online.<br />
I&#8217;m constantly on the lookout for the best ways and means to make your job simpler, and I pass the good stuff on to you.</p>
<p>I have developed the eBay Cash Machine &#8211; it allows everyone to make a great income on eBay 99% automatically. It only takes a few minutes to set up and once that is done you will have your own eBay Businesses that literally run on auto-pilot!<br />
You just wait for the money to come in!</p>
<p>I have found a foolproof method how anyone can easily make an extra $250, $500 or even $1000 per week on eBay using my eBay Ca$h Machine.?</p>
<p>Now before I get to deep into the details let me tell you what the eBay Ca$h Machine ISN&#8217;T.</p>
<p>It is NOT a promote my affiliate program to make m.oney!<br />
It is NOT a NOT A Get-Rich Q.uick Scheme!<br />
It is NOT a Face To Face Selling program of Any Kind!<br />
It is NOT a Trial Offer to sign up for!<br />
It is NOT some garbage product that refers you to purchase other garbage products.<br />
It is NOT a M.LM, a Pyramid Scheme, Gifting or anything else like that.<br />
It is NOT like anything you have ever seen.</p>
<p>For Full Details please read the attached .html fil</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first started designing websites I used a web tool called Frontpage which was created by Microsoft.  It was a tool that I taught myself how to use over the course of a few months and my husband who is a huge computer nerd helped me on the really difficult parts to learn!  I built many sites with that tool and it was great for what I needed to do.  </p>
<p>But what if you don&#8217;t want to build sites from scratch or take the time to learn a tool like that?  </p>
<p>Nowadays you can create your domain and be up and running in a day with a professional and fantastic looking site.  It&#8217;s done with a blog.  You can use a theme that suits your style by picking from thousands available and all you need to do is start adding your posts which act as your content.  Its fresh and the search engines LOVE it.</p>
<p>Add some great photos to it and some affiliate products and you&#8217;re in business!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey friends,</p>
<p>Just in case you haven&#8217;t seen it, Ed Dale&#8217;s 30DC started yesterday but you can still jump on the bandwagon and start the training.  This is free internet training that he and his co-workers do once a year.  I believe this is year 5.</p>
<p>They show you all the latest and greatest tools and technology to have an online business.  You can view all the videos online.</p>
<p>I am all for this kind of training because it is video and video helps you actually see how to do something instead of someone just telling you.  It&#8217;s a much more effective way of learning.  It&#8217;s the main reason I have so many training videos in The Business Idea Center.</p>
<p>So check it out.   http://www.thirtydaychallenge.com</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a top home based business idea that has a nice appeal to it because of the market trend that it follows.  And that is anything &#8220;back-to-school&#8221; orientated.  This being August 1st, our kids are going to be going back to school in just 4 weeks so if you have a cool product or have an affiliate product that you can start marketing RIGHT NOW, then do it!</p>
<p>Find the right keywords and start blogging quickly, bookmarking, and making some quick relationships so you can jump on this bandwagon.  For this particular trend I might suggest doing some targeted Google Ad Words because you might not have enough time to make it otherwise.  Compare advertising costs on Ad words to what you could be making and see if there is enough profit to go that route.  Ad Words gets your message out to millions in hours, not weeks.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of experience in starting small home based businesses so I thought I would take a moment and share my top 5 tips with you if you are just starting out.  I had to learn the hard way on some of these tips so hopefully by sharing them with you, you can avoid the pitfalls I fell into!</p>
<p>Tip #1 &#8211; Be Realistic.  It takes some time for a website to be indexed by the search engines and to get the traffic you need to start delivering sales.  You&#8217;ll need to have fresh content on your site for the engines to keep coming back and start ranking you so understand that you will be doing lots of content writing on your site at first.</p>
<p>Tip #2 &#8211; Don&#8217;t expect to be a millionaire in a week.  There are so many sites out there telling you that you can make hundreds of dollars a day.  While that is very possible to do it will not happen in your first week!  It takes a long time to build up to that kind of income without spending it all in advertising to get the traffic you need.</p>
<p><a title="Zeszyt od wszystkiego" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42191644@N00/3768681630/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 6px;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3539/3768681630_b34a06072e_t.jpg" border="0" alt="Zeszyt od wszystkiego" width="100" height="70" /></a>Tip #3 &#8211; Have a plan.  Make yourself a basic business plan on what you want to have happen in your company, what you expect your business to look like and what you are selling/promoting.  Be clear with your expectations.</p>
<p>Tip #4 &#8211; Be confident.  Just when things are looking bleak, don&#8217;t completely throw in the towel.  Find a new approach to what you doing and test things.  Testing ways of selling happens every day in every company.  Even the bigs ones.  They are constantly re-inventing themselves and finding out what is profitable and what is not.  You can do the same thing.</p>
<p>Tip #5 &#8211; Get advice.  Network with other small home business owners to see what best practices they are using.  Go to the 30 Day Challenge which is free internet marketing advice to learn ways of making profits.  See what other people are doing.<br />
<small><a title="mac_filko" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42191644@N00/3768681630/" target="_blank"></a></small>Starting your own business can be the best thing you ever do if you are prepared for it.  Take the time to think things through and get a plan of action.  Write it all down so you can refer back to your plan.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever wonder how companies do market research online?  Naturally they do a ton of research to make sure the public is looking for what they want to sell and to see if it&#8217;s a viable market for them to dump money into.  The same goes for small home based businesses but with less money to spend.</p>
<p>So there are a few ways you can do some research online to see what&#8217;s hot.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check out Wordtrackers.com&#8217;s free trial if you have some ideas and what to see if people are looking for them. (I actually don&#8217;t recommend paying for the subscription because there are better products out there for less money.  You can see some basic research with this tool.)</li>
<li>Try Google&#8217;s free tool to get a basic idea if you already know of an idea.</li>
<li>Use Dogpile&#8217;s research tool to see what people are searching for online.</li>
<li>Join an affiliate program to see what products are selling well.</li>
<li>Check out the top selling stuff on Ebay.</li>

Just because you work from home doesn&#8217;t mean you are by yourself.  In fact, with web 2.0 you are more connected to people now than if you worked in a high rise building.  Web 2.0 just means social networks.  When the web first came out it was primarily static web pages either giving you some information about a topic or it was selling something.  Now with web 2.0 comes the socialization of sites.</p>
<p>Think Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Linkedin, Digg, Stumble Upon, Mixx and hundreds of other sites as well.  These sites have millions of people surfing through their sites and commenting on articles, news and what they are doing in their own lives.  It is all about building networks and relationships.  That&#8217;s something the old web never did.</p>
<p>But here is the thing &#8211; don&#8217;t try to sell your product on web 2.o.  It&#8217;s taboo.  Instead you want to build yourself as an authority figure on your particular topic by offering free advice, commenting on how-to articles and by interacting with others.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll build your presence online and your potential clients/customers will see you as the guru and go to your site.  That&#8217;s how you work social marketing into your daily marketing plan.  You will be bulding your home business network each and every time you interact socially online.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-372" style="margin: 6px;" title="Start Twitter for your business" src="http://www.businessideascenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tweet-150x73.gif" alt="Start Twitter for your business" width="150" height="73" />Everyone on the planet is using Twitter so if you are not, you better jump on the bandwagon and get yourself an account over at twitter.com!</p>
<p>Twitter.com is about creating relationships with anyone and everyone you choose to follow or if they choose to follow you.  It&#8217;s like saying what you are doing right now and people get to see it.  But don&#8217;t try to sell to anyone on twitter.com because that&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s about.</p>
<p>In my opinion, every large and small business should be on twitter because as you know the internet can seem very cold and unloving and twitter.com and all the other social networking sites have allowed the internet to come alive.  Literally!  People are talking to other that interest them.</p>
<p>The chain reaction to twitter.com is pretty cool too.  If you start following someone and another person sees your profile they can start following you and it just builds and builds.   And you want to build your network and of course you can follow groups that you are interested in that happen to be what your small business idea is about!  You can get your word out without selling and without being spammy.  You never want to be spammy.</p>
<p>So go to twitter.com and sign up for an account and start tweeting!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My idea of a top home business is anything that is bringing in revenue that MAKES YOU HAPPY!  No sense in doing work that is not what you believe in or what doesn&#8217;t make you happy.  </p>
<p>I can remember the feeling I had when I knew I wanted to be an entrepreneur and of course there were many factors that helped me feel that way.  I wanted to be home with my kids.  That was number 1.  </p>
<p>I also wanted to be able to have a creative voice and working for someone else in a somewhat demeaning industry wasn&#8217;t going to allow me to do that.  I was a travel agent for 18 years and followed the corporate mentality for longer than I would have liked but the money was paying my bills.</p>
<p>So when we made the move for me to stay home it was for my kids but also so that I could start my own business.  </p>
<p>I went to the library and got a few books on how to start a business.  I took classes at Clark University.  I made lists of what I was interested in and what I thought would be cool.  Then I stayed awake for weeks wracking my brain on what I could create that wasn&#8217;t already created and off I went to create it!  Did you get all that?</p>
<p>The problem was I had no idea on what the general public wanted or was looking for so I had no idea who my target market was.  I had no idea if people were even searching online for what I was creating. </p>
<p>So I spent all that time making something no one wanted.  Ice Cream Toppings to be exact.  Not a lot of people are searching online for ice cream toppings!</p>
<p>So it was over time that I learned how to do market research so that I could narrow in on what people wanted.  Why create something no one wants when you have thousands of people looking right online for something they do want!!!!!  </p>
<p>Seems so simple but if what interests you isn&#8217;t being searched for or isn&#8217;t a viable market to sell in you aren&#8217;t going to make any money from it no matter how much you like it.</p>
<p>So my idea of a top home business is something that will sell that you do have an interest in.  And don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel&#8230;find already made products that you can sell as an affiliate to a hungry market.  That&#8217;s what will make you a top home based business.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-339" style="margin: 6px;" title="Amazon.com" src="http://www.businessideascenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/amazoncom.jpg" alt="Amazon.com" width="135" height="79" />You may be wondering who we do business with at The Business Ideas Center and how we come up with ideas for businesses.</p>
<p>Well let me first start by saying that anyone can be successful at running their own online business if they have the right tools and the know-how.  Isn&#8217;t that true for just about anything you do?  If you understand the concepts behind what you are doing and you have the tools to produce the work you want then you can succeed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been in internet marketing, building internet business and web development for 8 years and trust me, if you are trying to figure out how the internet works as far as building an online business by yourself, its going to take a while!  But if you have someone who can show you the steps you need to take then you&#8217;ve just cut your learning curve in half.</p>
<p>We work with companies you have heard of&#8230;Amazon.com, Google and so many more.  You can too, very easily.  Anyone can actually.  You just need to know how.</p>
<p>We get our ideas by doing market research with a pretty cool powerful tool.  There&#8217;s nothing on the market like it.  We also use social marketing tools that are available to you too.  You just need to know where they are.</p>
<p>Like I said, if you have the resources and the know how it can be done.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been working on the Ideas Database and I&#8217;ve just finished adding about 10 more work from home ideas to it.  I&#8217;m excited because the possibilities are almost endless to the amount of commissions you can make because of the system we have in place and how you can just keep adding ideas to your collection.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I mean by that.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you found flip flops with arch supports in them in the database and you choose to promote that as an affiliate.  You also already have all the keywords that are perfect for promoting it and you set your site up, optimize it and off you go.  </p>
<p>Then you decide to look through the database and you find tennis balls and think that might be a cool thing to promote as an affiliate.  You take the keywords you want, set up a new site with a whole new name and since you&#8217;re hosting it through our partner you can put as many sites as you want on one account, you can keep going with different ideas.  </p>
<p>And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re building your empire.  You have <em>not </em>put all your eggs into one basket!  </p>
<p>And you have all the ideas right in front of you!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was reading on Boston.com today an article about work at home jobs and how this company called, The Rat Race Rebellion, which is a website that tracks at-home jobs, finds 57 phonies for every one that&#8217;s for real.  Isn&#8217;t that awful?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s sad is that all these people who are scamming others just don&#8217;t care.  How can there be so much greed in our world?  Okay, so don&#8217;t get me started right!!!!!</p>
<p>So if you want to truly have a work at home internet business then you need to find the good guys and ditch the bad guys.  At the Business Ideas Center we offer up front ideas that you can use to earn affiliate commissions which is a very successful way to earn money online.  But not everyone is on the up and up like we are.  </p>
<p>Here is some interesting information from The Rat Race Rebellion about some SCAM work from home jobs.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL YOU DON&#8217;T FALL INTO THESE SCAMS.<br />
__________________________________________________________________<br />
The &#8220;Classic&#8221; Scams Still Reeling in Unsuspecting Job Seekers</p>
<p><strong>Stuffing Envelopes:</strong><br />
The bottom line is this – there are machines that stuff envelopes and no legitimate company is going to pay a human being to do something a machine can do in a fraction of the time.</p>
<p>What usually happens with the stuffing scam is, a person reads the ad, sends some $ to get started, and receives in return, a letter instructing them to place the same ad they replied to so they can scam others as they have been scammed.</p>
<p><strong>Typing and Data Entry:</strong><br />
While there is legitimate data entry work out there, you&#8217;ll have to wade through cyber-acres of scams to find it.</p>
<p>Scam ads typically claim you&#8217;ll earn a certain amount for every &#8220;application&#8221; you process.</p>
<p>As with the envelope stuffing scam, you pay a fee and are instructed to place the same ad you responded to and collect checks from those you scam. The &#8220;applications&#8221; you process come with a check and &#8211; if you decide to join the ranks of scammers &#8211; you keep the check. Hence, a payment for &#8220;processing&#8221; the application.</p>
<p>Another common &#8220;data entry&#8221; scam involves having the applicant pay a fee for software they will &#8220;need&#8221; to complete data entry jobs. Once you purchase the software, it becomes clear that you will be fully responsible for finding the data entry jobs yourself &#8211; work will not come from the company.</p>
<p><strong>Craft Assembly:</strong><br />
&#8220;Send money for a start-up kit with all the materials you&#8217;ll need, and earn money for every item you complete to our satisfaction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sounds great for those who are crafty but, with very few exceptions, these arrangements result in the individual receiving the kit, doing the work, and having it rejected time after time. Nothing they do to improve the &#8220;quality&#8221; of their work will make a difference because the scammer does not want the finished product back, they want the money for the kits&#8230; period.</p>
<p>One of the few we&#8217;ve found to be legit is the &#8220;Disciple&#8217;s Cross&#8221; &#8211; there is a fee for a start-up kit, but they also have a sterling reputation and a money back guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>Postal Forwarding:</strong><br />
Postal forwarding has become a huge problem &#8211; we&#8217;ve met several people who have not only lost their savings, but have also had brushes with the law after falling for this type of scam. In some cases, the scam involves the transport of stolen goods, in other cases, it has to do with cashing checks and forwarding money in exchange for a commission.</p>
<p>As an example of the first type of scam, we met a men who was looking for home-based work because he had a physical disability that made it difficult to manage a &#8220;traditional&#8221; job. He saw an ad for a job that required him to receive packages of electronics (MP3 players, video recorders, DVD players, etc.), repackage them, and ship them to a designated destination in Romania. In exchange, the &#8220;hiring company&#8221; would reimburse him for shipping expenses and pay him a fee for his services.</p>
<p>It sounded perfect to him and he figured that since there was no fee required up front, he thought it was a safe bet.</p>
<p>Once on board, he received packages in a rush! He repacked them according to the instructions he&#8217;d received and forwarded them to the address provided with an invoice for his expenses.</p>
<p>He received a check drawn on a non-US bank and deposited it in his account &#8211; proof that he was onto a good thing he thought.</p>
<p>Several weeks later, he learned from his bank that the checks were drawn on a non-existent account and had no value whatsoever. Further, when he reported the culprits to the authorities, he learned that he had unwittingly been instrumental in aiding thieves in their illegal transactions.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the &#8220;customer&#8221; had purchased the electronics with a stolen credit card and &#8220;laundered&#8221; them through this man. To add insult to injury, the instructions for shipping involved having him unwittingly lie to the US Customs Service by entering false information on their shipping forms.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this man had a good lawyer who was able to get him off the hook, but by then he had lost a large chunk of his savings and most of his dignity.</p>
<p><strong>Check and Funds Processing:</strong><br />
In this scam, the individual agrees to process funds for someone who claims to live in a country where the government makes it nearly impossible for them to do so themselves. They agree to send you a check or checks, you deposit them into your bank account, and send them a personal check for 80% of the amount &#8211; keeping 20% as a commission.</p>
<p>The problem &#8211; once you&#8217;ve cashed the check and sent a personal check back, you&#8217;re notified that the checks were forged, stolen, or counterfeit. Your bank will hold you personally responsible for any money they have lost as a result of the scam. This means that individual now owes the bank the amount that they have wired to Nigeria (or Senegal, or any number of places from which these scams originate) &#8211; usually thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Some banks have been known to prosecute the US-based account holder for fraud, others have had their computers confiscated by federal agencies.<br />

In my post yesterday I was saying that it is possible to earn extra money online but that it is going to take some time.  But what I wanted to tell you is how you can get money quickly if you need cash right away while you are building your ideas site.  There is a way without falling into a scam and my guess if just about everyone on the planet has heard of it.  And it&#8217;s not feeding money into a slot machine hoping you hit the jackpot!</p>

<p>Yup, Ebay.  You don&#8217;t need a web site or blog for this, you just need something to sell that people want to buy!</p>
<p>I know it might seem a little intimidating at first when you go on and look at auctions but I&#8217;ve done plenty of buying and selling on Ebay and it&#8217;s pretty easy.  I think the most important thing is to be very careful with your auction description, refund/exchanges policy, shipping procedure and price etc.  There are tons of manuals you can get from the library on how to sell on Ebay if you want to learn about it first.  Plus of course there is the whole help section from Ebay.  Read up on this BEFORE you start an auction.</p>
<p>Ebay allows you to sell quickly.  They keep a portion of your proceeds and so does PayPal if you are using them to do the money processing.  I highly recommend you use PayPal for that.  They are terrific.</p>
<p>So there you have it if you need a way to earn extra money while you are waiting for your main ideas to kick in.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the recession and the job market the way it is my sister-in-law is looking for a way to earn quick money.  Can she do it online and can she do it quickly?  Well, yes and no.  She absolutely can earn money online but it will take a little bit of time.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why.</p>
<p>When you create a new site with a new domain, the search engines need to index your site.  What that means is that the search engines (Google, Yahoo, Bing etc.) have to crawl your site, see what you have for content on your site and then add it to their files.  That&#8217;s the layman&#8217;s explanation for it!  This can take days to weeks.  Having your site on a blog and writing posts to it every day using your main keyword phrases helps it get indexed much quicker than a regular site.  That&#8217;s why I always recommend using a blog like one from wordpress.org.</p>
<p>Okay, after the site gets indexed the search engines then go and look to see if anyone is linking to your site.  They think that if other similar sites that they like are linking to your site you must be pretty good and they will begin to rank you a little higher on their search engine.  It takes a little bit of time to build these links because you have to do it manually in order to get &#8220;organic&#8221; backlinks.</p>
<p>Then you can also start submitting your posts and content to social bookmarking sites that also help you build links and you can then begin to build relationships with other sites.  ll of this takes some time and your marketing efforts will be a daily event and not something you do once or twice and think it&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>Every good online marketer knows you can make some serious cash online but you need to put in the effort and it will take some time.  Plan on a few months to start seeing some decent traffic if you put a marketing plan in place and stick to it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 6px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2425/3715946984_0dbe62157c_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Balancing Your Home Based Business " width="240" height="180" />I am a stay at home mom.  I juggle my family&#8217;s daily routines, food shopping, cleaning, laundry, cooking, and of course my own online business.  I have a laptop that I drag from room to room to room and I camp out wherever I can find an empty seat.  I work a lot of hours during the week and that&#8217;s just on my business.</p>
<p>You may be wondering how I get all that done.  I sometimes wonder too!  I have trained myself to work around my family, when my kids are at school, and I often work late at night.  I also work weekends.  But I am home with my kids, I have attended every single event at my daughter&#8217;s school, I have gone on field trips with her class, I bring her to gymnastics on Tuesday afternoons and I&#8217;m a Girl Scout Cookie Mom Friday afternoons.  I couldn&#8217;t possibly do all that if I worked outside my home, which I did for 18 years until I had my 2nd daughter in 2001.  I&#8217;ve been working from home ever since and I wouldn&#8217;t trade it for the world.</p>
<p>So how do you balance a home based small business with your own life and family?</p>
<p>Here are 10 tips to help you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get organized.  Make folders for your important papers and how-to information so you can refer back to them as you need to.  There is a lot to know when you are building your business and if you start from the very beginning by being organized you&#8217;ll save yourself some valuable time.  And since you work for yourself time is money.</li>
<li>Create a very basic business plan.  I&#8217;m not one for long drawn out plans but I do believe in having a very good idea of what you want to accomplish with your business so you don&#8217;t get sidetracked with other less important avenues.  State your mission or goals for your company and what you plan to do with your business.  Decide the who, what, where, when and why of your business and put it in writing so you can refer to it often.</li>
<li>Create Lists. Write these down or use Excel to create lists of tasks you need to get done.  You can download templates from Excel that help you create these lists.</li>
<li>Use a scale to prioritize your tasks.  On a scale of 1-10 or 1-50 (It really depends on how many tasks you have) rate them in the order in which they are the most imperative to get done.  Then start working on them in that order.</li>
<li>Set small goals that you can achieve and progress from there.  Once you know your tasks, break them down into small goals that you can achieve in chunks.  This will help make the task a little less daunting!</li>
<li>Set a schedule to help you stick to your work.  I know that I can work from 9a-3pm M-F during the school year without interruption because my kids are at school.  I also know that I can work early on Sat/Sun because I am a morning person and everyone else in my family will be sleeping until 10am!  So I know that I can fit in the hours I need to even though it is broken up throughout the day.  I stop working at 3pm and spend the rest of the afternoon with my kids.  After they go to bed I occasionally pop back online to check my mail and to update my Twitter, Facebook and other accounts.  Find out what works for you and try to set a schedule for yourself.</li>
<li>Set up down time as well to decompress at the end of the day.  Stop working at least an hour before going to bed or you will never wind down long enough to fall asleep.  Trust me on this one.  Entrepreneurs&#8217; minds never stop.  Get a tape recorder and leave it near your bed if you can&#8217;t shut your mind off at night.</li>
<li>Focus on what you want, not what you don&#8217;t want.  This is pretty cool actually.  When you focus on what it is you are trying to achieve and NOT on what you won&#8217;t want to have happen you will actually be sending out brain waves with a frequency to them that attract like brainwaves.  Okay, so what the heck does that mean?  It means &#8220;like attracts like&#8221;.  Start focusing on what it is that you DO want. For example, &#8220;I want to work from home so I can be with my family and be successful in my career&#8221;.  Versus, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to have to go back to that awful job where my boss yells at me all day&#8221;.  See the difference?</li>
<li>Outsource.  There are plenty of outsourcing solutions available at pretty affordable prices.  Odesk is one of them and Guru.com is another great one for virtual assistants.  Or consider hiring a college student to do some content writing for you.  College kids are brilliant with computers and can work for great wages.  You may even be able to find some students that would write for you as part of their college course.  Check around with colleges to see what they recommend.</li>
<li>Get support from your family.  You may be surprised at how willing they are to help you when you tell them that they can&#8217;t have any fresh baked chocolate chips cookies after school if you can&#8217;t finish your work on time or that your husband may have to stop at the grocery store on his way home if you can&#8217;t get that last task checked off.  You may be surprised!</li>

<p>Can Chrome Help Your Startup Shine?<br />
Google&#8217;s new operating system has serious small-business potential.<br />
By Scott Steinberg   |   July 13, 2009</p>
<p>URL: http://www.entrepreneur.com/technology/shinyobjects/article202602.html</p>
<p>First it was a web browser. Then it became an operating system. But look a step further, and it’s not hard to see how Google’s Chrome could potentially become the springboard for an entirely new generation of entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Like all operating systems, Chrome aims to be the platform through which you interface with your PC and access all your programs and file. But upon arriving in the second half of 2010, Chrome OS&#8211;which will initially be targeted at netbooks&#8211;will also introduce several innovations. Case in point: Unlike previous operating systems, whose origins all predate the web, Chrome, which is completely free to all and runs on top of a Linux kernel, is putting online functionality first. Google’s argument is essentially that the web isn’t simply part of how we interface with computers today, but rather the nexus of the entire experience. As such, users will be able to quickly boot their desktop or notebook systems, go online and seamlessly integrate with an array of cloud computing applications.</p>
<p>These applications, accessible via any web browser and capable of providing access to similar functions as traditional word processing, spreadsheet and database packages, have several advantages over typical software suites. For one, they’re accessible nearly anywhere. So long as you have a web browser handy, you can call up all your data on demand, making it possible to bring the office everywhere you go. Information is also stored off-site at a presumably secure location, preventing against local hard drive failure or lightning frying your PC. Content can further be shared and updated in real time across multiple computers, letting colleagues seamlessly collaborate on projects, without accidentally duplicating efforts or inadvertently working at cross purposes. System requirements are low, too, with most of the serious number-crunching done on host systems, not your humble desktop, eliminating the need to invest in expensive hardware. All of which, of course, presents an opportunity to fill a gaping market void by forward-thinking business owners.</p>
<p>For example: Audience size for software programs has often been limited by several mitigating factors, none of the least of which is the countless system configurations in existence. In other words, every single PC out there is essentially its own unique entity, and capable of featuring a dizzying array of hardware and software components, complete with countless individual points of failure. It’s the reason so many software programs come with minimum requirements printed on the box, which&#8211;even if met&#8211;may not guarantee 100 percent compatibility with one’s system.</p>
<p>Previously, when companies built software packages, projected sales would always be constrained by how many systems reportedly met these basic hardware necessities, and programs’ scope was designed accordingly. Now, Google is actively urging developers to use the web as a standardized platform for application development that’s compatible with any garden-variety internet browser. So, by proxy, Chrome also inherently boosts the size of business owners’ potential market by several degrees of magnitude, freeing entrepreneurs to focus primarily on building innovative, high-quality products, the majority of which can be packaged and sold without any need for download or installation. Total these enhancements, and small business owners suddenly have access to a much wider playing field where specific cloud computing applications can be designed by teams of one or 100 to meet virtually any need or scope.</p>
<p>Cloud computing isn’t new, with services like Zoho suite, Google Docs and Gmail already popular among modern professionals. But they’re still in the infancy stage, with plenty of opportunity remaining to address a growing variety of customer needs, and experiment with new free-, flat fee- or project-/subscription-based business models. Given Google’s sizable marketing might behind it, consider the following as well. Unlike other spins on Linux (the much-celebrated, yet still largely esoteric OS that’s long played distant second to Microsoft’s Windows among everyday shoppers), Chrome might just bridge the gap, and turbo-charge widespread mainstream adoption in the process.</p>
<p>While threatening to revolutionize how computer users think about and interact with their PCs, therein lies the possibility that should have entrepreneurs salivating. Because rather than having to design software products and services for specific operating systems and hardware configurations, soon you’ll be able to design them in more flexible, scalable and cost-efficient ways than ever before and&#8211;most important&#8211;for a wider range of customers than has ever been within virtual reach.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-81" style="margin: 6px;" title="Wordpress for Computer Home Based Businesses" src="http://www.businessideascenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/wordpressforbusinessbloggers.jpg" alt="Wordpress for Computer Home Based Businesses" width="162" height="200" />If you&#8217;re new to internet marketing or website building I want to strongly urge you to go the route of a blog as the platform for your new business.</p>
<p>Blogs are the number one fastest way to get your message across to the masses and here are just a few reasons why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search engines LOVE blogs!  Google seems to index blogs quickly so that&#8217;s your first major benefit right there.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s very easy to post fresh new content on your blog without website building knowledge.</li>
<li>Getting links are fairly easy because you can bookmark your content across social websites like Digg.com, delicious.com etc.</li>
<li>You&#8217;ll save a ton of money by not having to hire a web designer (that can run you hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars.)</li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer to use the blogs at Wordpress.org with my own hosting company.  This way you get to have your own domain name and email address and more control over your blog.  When you have your own domain name you look more professional and people will put more trust into your business.  Plus going this way allows you so many more choices and control over how you can design your blog.</p>
<p>For example, this site for the Business Ideas Center is built with a Wordpress.org blog that I was able to just add my own images to the header to make it unique to my business and I have it hosted so I can have my own domain name (that&#8217;s the www.businessideascenter.com) and I can have my own email accounts.  If I had built the site with Expression Web or Dreamweaver I would have had to do a whole lot more work and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to have the blog section where people can make comments and interact with my business.  The way the web works now everyone wants to interact and get to know you.  By having a blog website you give them that opportunity.</p>
<p>If you won&#8217;t want to have your site hosted then go to Wordpress.com and get a blog there.  Your domain name will be tagged with Wordpress.com and you can just use an email account from Google or Yahoo or one of the other free email services.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and if you are setting up your computer home based business check out what blogs can do for you.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="The Microwave" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26266886@N00/3527637609/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 6px;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2054/3527637609_256dd1d864_m.jpg" border="0" alt="The Microwave" width="216" height="162" /></a>Every time I read a magazine, go to the dentist, have my hair styled, or go grocery shopping I can&#8217;t help but think of ways products could be better.  Luckily, not everyone has that insane curse!  I have spent almost 10 years developing new business products and ideas so after a while you get pretty good at it.  But that&#8217;s not what I do now and for good reason.</p>
<p>There are problems with coming up with a new product idea or one that could be improved upon.  First of all it takes a lot of time.  Secondly, it&#8217;s a risk not knowing if the new product will sell or not and third is that it is expensive to develop the product.</p>
<p>So just how do I come up with ideas for small business wannabes?  I don&#8217;t reinvent the wheel; that&#8217;s how!  I find already existing products waiting to be sold that are in niche markets that have keywords that people are searching for which the big guys haven&#8217;t found.  Yup, if you have the right technology, the know-how and the experience to find them they are everywhere.</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t kill yourself thinking you have to come up with the next big product to hit the market since the microwave oven for your business idea.  Think easier, quicker and already in your face.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are so many scams that I have personally seen when it comes to making money on the internet.  Please know that there are <strong>thousands </strong>of sites out there promising to make you rich quickly by following their plan.  Oh my gosh if I had a nickle for every person who fell for that&#8230;</p>
<p>I think I know the number one reason why they get so many people to &#8220;drink their cool aid&#8221; and that is because people are tired of the rat race, or they have lost their job, and are desperate for quick income.</p>
<p>It is tempting when they promise you the stars and moon and show you pictures of THEIR boats and cars.  Can I just tell you that I can photo shop myself with boats and cars too.  It&#8217;s pretty easy.</p>
<p>Anyway, find yourself an honest, well known company to help you get on your feet.  Can you make money on the internet without getting scammed?  Absolutely.  But do yourself a favor and if it sounds too good to be true don&#8217;t do it.  Because it will be.</p>
<p>Look at how other people are actually MAKING money on the internet and follow those people and those patterns.  Pretty soon you can tell the good guys from the bad guys!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know you might be thinking, &#8220;That&#8217;s why I &#8216;m Here!&#8221; because you DON&#8217;T have a small business idea!  I have just added 5 more online business ideas that you can make money on the internet with and they are in the members section.  </p>
<p>Not a member?  You need to be!</p>
<p>Members of the Business Ideas Center have full access to the database of business ideas that have already had market research done on them, already had Google traffic keywords picked out for them and already have suggested domain names to help rank high in the search engines.   Members can then choose what idea they want to have completely turned into a search engine optimized blog/website.  And all the work has been done for them.  </p>
<p>Now you might also be thinking that this is all some automated program that just picks random topics and generates keywords that you&#8217;ll never be able to rank highly for.  Nope!  It couldn&#8217;t be further from that.</p>
<p>The Business Ideas Center is staffed by a HUMAN!  WOW!  That human is me&#8230;Nadine.  I have done all the market research, all the keyword research and know what domain names are the best.  I plow through the ideas weekly to make sure that they are still marketable and not saturated.  I also make sure that you have all the ground work done for you so that you can be that much further ahead of the game.  So basically I am saving you about 2 months worth of work!</p>
<p>So rather than say, “You really should find an idea that is marketable,” and send you off to muddle through it, you’ve now got one platform from which to get marketable, keyword ready, business ideas on which to choose from.</p>
<p>Alright, enough about that.  Get into the members area and grab your ready-to-go online business idea before someone else does.  It&#8217;s about as easy as plug and play!</p>
