      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By now you should have your VIDEO SCRIPT and VIDEO OPENER ready to roll. So the next logical step is to frame your video.</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step-3: Frame Your Video</span></em></p>
<p>You take the video script and chop it into frames, so you know what exactly is going to go into each frame of the video. And again remember the FAB video scripting technique. Each frame will talk about ONE feature and its associated advantages and benefits. You should be able come up with some 5-10 frames based on the individual features of the product.</p>
<p>Now all you have to do is simply open up PowerPoint or Keynote (if using MAC) and load each slide with the content you have developed for each frame. But before you do that go search for a good PowerPoint template related to the product you are promoting. This will make you video look more engaging. Ok so you have got all the frames loaded in PowerPoint, what next?</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step-4: Adding Sizzle to your video</span></em></p>
<p>A picture is worth a thousand words. You want your video to look engaging and not monotonous and boring. Now there are two types of images that you can add to your video. One is the images that showcase the features of the product and you will most likely get this from the product manufacturers if you are promoting an affiliate offer.</p>
<p>The second kind of images that you need to add to your video is called “EMOTIONAL ACCELERATORS”. These are images that bring out powerful emotion that written words can’t express. And there are hundreds of websites where you can find these types of images that come with no royalty fee. Clipart.com is one such site where you can grab a lot of these images for cheap.</p>
<p>One last thing you want to do is add some PowerPoint transitions between the frames. Like when you move from one slide to another you can apply a flipping effect (like flipping each page on a book), a sliding effect, or a spinning effect and so on. It’s very easy to do this in just 2 or 3 clicks using the PowerPoint animations features. So take advantage of this feature that comes free with PowerPoint.</p>
<p>The reason why we want to do this is because every time something flies in or moves it resets the viewers’ attention. So in essence it gets the reader to watch the full video and more video viewership.</p>
<p>Now that we have everything ready, how do we put it all together to produce our money making video? And that’s the final and most important step coming up next.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several ways to make money online, be it selling info products or selling physical products or selling services or even promoting affiliate offers, the fastest way to do it is by creating video.  And you could create such money making videos in 5 simple steps</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step-1: Writing the video script</span></em></p>
<p>Don’t be scared by the word video scripting, it simply means what you are going to say in the video. And you can easily create video that keeps the visitor glued to your video by using this simple FAB video scripting technique</p>
<p>FEATURES, ADVANTAGES and BENEFITS – yes this is the FAB technique</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to promote a video camera on Amazon. Head over to the product page on Amazon, for example the Kodak zi8 pocket video camera page. Now you will see that Amazon has a list of product features and that means half the work is already done.</p>
<p>Here is one of the features of the Kodak zi8 pocket video camera page “take full HD 1080p videos wherever you go”.</p>
<p>So what is the advantage of this feature? Full 1080p is the highest resolution of high definition video available and that means you can create videos of very high quality with this camera.</p>
<p>So what are the benefits of this feature? You could capture your child’s cheerful smile, those funny moments you will cherish forever and more. Here is where the magic happens. People look for benefits rather the features. Feature is a quantitative way of describing the product. However benefits are the emotional experience from using the product.</p>
<p>And this simple FAB video scripting template is the basis of successful sales videos, infomercials and direct response marketing videos. So take each feature and apply the FAB video scripting layout and you will have long enough script to craft a 3-5 minute sales video or even longer. Follow this simple formula and you will have created a killer video script. Once you create the video script the next thing is</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Step-2: Video Opener</span></em></p>
<p>Well this is not some weirdo beer opener. Video opener is basically what you say in the very first screen on your video. You have got 8-15 seconds to grab the viewers’ attention and get them to watch the full video. So your video intros that make up the first 8-15 seconds is the critical element that decides whether your video is going to be a winner or dud.</p>
<p>Try this 3 part video opener</p>
<p>Part-1:  [In this video I am going to show you why]</p>
<p>Part-2:  [The Kodak zi8 is going to revolutionize the way you make your personal videos]</p>
<p>Part-3:  [And why it might be the only camera you'll ever need - saving you money and making it simple for you to create video]</p>
<p>First you tell them there is a reason WHY they should WATCH this video. Next you tell them the KEY OUTCOME they will get by following your advice. And finally you tell how the video will HELP them save time and money.</p>
<p>It’s so simple! Now you take this 3-part opener and use it with any product that you promote, just make part 2 and part 3 appropriate for the product that you are promoting.  And this simple formula serves as the perfect video intros for YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Well we have covered a lot of ground so far, go ahead apply this and I will be back with the next 3 steps of producing your killer sales video like a video boss.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much money can you make with online video? How about $5,000,000?</p>
<p>Yes you heard me right, that much was made from 3 product launches that used video instead of a 30 page sales letter. And the guy behind making the videos &#8211; Andy Jenkins is giving away some of the secrets of producing such money making videos.</p>
<p>If you thought producing such videos require expensive video equipment, video editing software, slick copywriting and geeky skills to put it all together then you are in for a real surprise. Because these videos were made using Microsoft PowerPoint. You can use something simple as a Flip-cam and produce videos that are TV-Studio quality.</p>
<p>Now if producing video is that easy why isn’t everybody making such videos?</p>
<p>The thing is not many people know that’s it quite easy to produce the videos. Head over to YouTube and you will find tons of amateur videos. However when you want to do videos for your business, you do want to look professional and interesting to the people watching your videos. And that is what makes most people to shy away from making videos.</p>
<p>In fact Andy Jenkins himself is a camera shy person that he used a cartoon character and did a voice over for the video.<br />
And of the hundreds of videos he’s produced he shows up in front of the camera in less than 5 videos. So even if you are camera shy you can still make videos that make money.</p>
<p>And here is the kicker. Guess what?</p>
<p>Amateur videos on YouTube and other popular video hosting sites are getting ranked on first page of Google results pretty fast. If people who have no idea about marketing can make a casual video and make it to the first page of Google, you can do much better with all the marketing knowledge you have. Your video could hit the first page of Google within a weeks’ time, while a traditional website might take a few months of SEO to get onto the first page.</p>
<p>And you can compete with authority sites that have been ranking on the first page for ages.</p>
<p>Tell me if you find anything better than this – creating a 5 minute video, hitting the first of Google in less than a week and converting all that traffic into cold hard cash. Video has been gaining momentum over the last couple of years and it’s on the rise. Now is the time to ride the wave and profit.</p>
