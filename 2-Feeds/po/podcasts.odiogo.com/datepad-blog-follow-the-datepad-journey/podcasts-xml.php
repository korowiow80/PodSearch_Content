What I find interesting is that eHarmony did a deal with Yahoo in Australia last year. I wonder how long it will take for this deal/relationship to dissolve?</p>
<p>Old Yahoo personals account holders will be asked to merge their accounts to Match.com. It will be interesting to see how long this will take to come together and if there will be any fallout. Match is on a bit of a tear after acquiring singlesnet.com and niche dating service People Media last year.</p>
<p>The <a title="Internet Dating" href="http://www.datepad.com" target="_self">internet dating</a> world is playing musical chairs once again, let us know what you think is the next big merger in the comments.</p>

Many of the new services Foursquare, Gowalla and Yelp have been building impressive user bases although they pale in comparison to most <a title="Internet Dating" href="http://www.datepad.com" target="_self">internet dating</a> sites they are significant!</p>
<p>The rumor mill is running crazy today with reports that Facebook will go location based in the month of May. The big question is will the current location based networks be able to survive?</p>
<p>The other question is whether or not Facebook will allow outside developers access to this data. If the later is the case I would very concerned if I was an investor/owner in the aforementioned sites.</p>
<p>Good luck to everyone as it&#8217;s becoming more and more apparent each day that Facebook controls the social graph and we&#8217;re just along for the ride.</p>
<p>Let us know your thoughts?</p>

<p>Ending weeks of speculation about its future, Palm has been acquired by Hewlett-Packard for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>As such, it appears that Palm’s mobile operating system — webOS — has lived to fight another day, with Palm CEO Jon Rubinstein saying in a statement that “HP’s longstanding culture of innovation, scale and global operating resources make it the perfect partner to rapidly accelerate the growth of webOS.”</p>
<p>The survival of webOS and its parent company had come under question in recent weeks, with some analysts suggesting that shares of Palm were essentially worthless. Things only got worse when RadioShack decided to stop selling Palm’s two flagship devices: Pre and Pixi.</p>
<p>Ok so what does this have to do with Dating? There are a few <a title="Internet Dating" href="http://www.datepad.com" target="_self">dating sites</a> like match.com that have developed applications for the Palm app store and while I would have assumed this was a total waste maybe there will be some saving grace in the time and money that was spent on development?</p>
<p>Will HP kill the brand off and incorporate their existing technology into their own devices or will Palm go on? Let us know your thoughts?</p>

At the end of the day most of us don&#8217;t because well, we have this concern about this thing called Karma! Anyways, for your reading pleasure it appears as though Craigslist is making great money, try 80% of their revenue is profit and a good chunk of it comes from &#8220;Adult Services&#8221;!!!!!</p>
<p>More than half of that revenue comes from recruitment advertising, but 30% of it comes from Craigslist’s adult services ads. By the AIM Group’s estimation, Craigslist’s adult services — formerly known as “erotic services” — will funnel in more than $36 million in revenue for 2010.</p>
<p>The Classified Intelligence Report also finds that Craigslist stands to take home anywhere from $88 to $99 million in profit, which means the company could see nearly 80% of revenue as profits. Plus, AIM Group founder Peter M. Zollman purports that, “Per employee, it generates more than $4 million in revenue and profits of $2.9 million to $3.2 million.”</p>
