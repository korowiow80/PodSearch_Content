      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been hearing great things about the P90x recovery drink, but I can&amp;#8217;t really afford it. Is there an alternative that will be just as good? I would really like to have something for recovery but don&amp;#8217;t think I need to spend all that money. Thanks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/90-day-answers/90_Day_Answers-P90x_Drink__Are_there_any_alternatives.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

Oh, and also, does the p90x guide come with pages that you can print out to write on about your progress?</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it normal to be so tired and beat up after taking the p90x fitness test? I just did it and I think I might die. Actually, I think I&#8217;m already dead. How am I supposed to get through the normal workouts if I can&#8217;t even get through the dangety darn fitness test. P90x is going to kick my tail. Is there a not so extreme fitness program that I can follow so that I can be in good enough shape for p90x?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m even ashamed to be asking this, but serioiusly. I&#8217;m a large girl and I&#8217;m wonering if this is going to be ok for me to do. Thanks everyone!</p>

      <description>I thought it would be fun to make a post about P90x nutrition basics. The nutrition portion of p90x is just as important as the workouts. Some people say that the nutrition is actually more important.
