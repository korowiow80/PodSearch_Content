      <description>I'm addicted to a show called “Deadliest Catch”.

      <description>Do you know how to provide collaborative leadership in a disciplined fashion? And how does one define disciplined collaboration?

      <description>We need our leaders to be organised, disciplined, analytical strategists but we also need them to be creative visionaries who are unafraid to constantly challenge paradigms.
