      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEO link building is a very important part of any search engine optimization strategy. If you do it right your keywords will improve on the search engine result pages and the organic traffic to your website will increase. But what exactly do you need to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The golden rule of effective SEO link building is to diversify your link building methods. Think of it this way, if you are a boxer that can only throw a left hook you will most likely lose all of your fights. In the same way links that are built by using only one method will not be very effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of SEO link building methods around and when you combine them the impact of your link building efforts will visibly improve. Two link building methods will be discussed in more detail in this article and you are welcome to use them to diversify your link building (Tip - make a list of the link building methods that you intend using and draw-up a weekly link building schedule with slots for all of the methods.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Content traps and article marketing:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;One of the most effective link building methods available today is the use of original and unique content to build links and generate traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Start by researching popular search phrases for your website, product or service and choose keywords with a low level of competition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Write original articles using the keywords that you have chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Submit the articles to article directories and Blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Build new links by linking back to your website in the resource box of each article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;In addition your articles should show-up in the search results for the low competition keywords that you have chosen thereby generating traffic to your website (content trap).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blog commenting:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;This method has been abused but it is still very effective when used in combination with other link building methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Search for Blogs that are relevant to your website, product or service and ensure that they allow you to enter your name and URL when posting a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Read the article and post a comment that is useful and informative (you need to give in order to receive.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Webmasters delete comments that they view as spam and it is important that you add value with your comment and not try and sell yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;Post comments on both do-follow and no-follow Blogs to ensure that the search engines view the links as &amp;#8220;natural&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the two methods discussed above you can build new links to your website through the use of bookmarks on social sites, forum profiles and posts, submitting your website URL to link directories and the uploading of videos to popular video sites.&amp;#160; SEO link building is very effective when you combine three or more of the available methods. Start improving your keyword search optimization today by becoming a boxer with more than just a left hook in your arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/alive-to-god-blog/Alive_to_God_Blog-The_Golden_Rule_of_SEO_Link_Building.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is not possible to implement a successful SEO strategy without first finding the best keywords and search phrases to target. When you research your market's keyword demand not only do you learn which phrases to target with your SEO, you also learn a lot about your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyword research will provide you with intelligence on market demand and will also allow you to provide a service or product that internet users are already searching for. When you know what people are looking for and the search phrases that they use to find these products or services, you can plan and implement an effective SEO strategy and position yourself perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article we will be taking a closer look at keyword research and how to choose the best keywords for your SEO campaign. With the information that you obtain from your keyword research you will be able to determine the potential value of the search traffic that can be generated by your chosen keywords and this will allow you to decide on a SEO budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keyword Research - Where to Start:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make a list of search phrases or words that describe your market&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use phrases consisting of 2 - 5 words&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Research the demand, popularity and competition for each keyword or phrase on your list&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use Google AdWords Keyword Tool or Wordtracker's Free Basic Keyword Demand Tool to research your words. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trim your list down to the 20 keywords with the highest number of monthly searches and lowest number of competitors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Determine the Potential Value of a Search Phrase:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Buy a campaign for the chosen keyword on Google AdWords&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose "exact match" and point the traffic to the most relevant web page on your site&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track the impressions and conversions for at least 200 clicks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the keyword generated 1000 impressions over a 24 hour period and 50 visitors came to your site with 5 visitors converting to a profit (not revenue) of $100, then a single visitor for that keyword is worth $2.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 1000 impressions in 24 hours should generate a click-thru rate of 30%-40% for the #1 ranking website on the organic search results for that keyword. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will result in 300-400 visits per day valued at $2 per visitor. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In this example the keyword would potentially be worth $600-$800 dollars per day.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Choosing the Best keywords for your SEO Campaign:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the keyword relevant to what your website offers? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will visitors using this search term to find your site, find what they are searching for?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will the traffic resulting from this search term convert into sales?&amp;#160; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Search for the term in the major search engines. If there are search advertisements along the top and right-hand side of the organic results, this phrase is valuable and is a good keyword for conversions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How difficult will it be to reach the top 10 results? If the top 10 spots are occupied by strong and established competitors you might have to work hard for months before your website will feature in the top results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyword research is extremely important to your website SEO and the benefits are numerous. If you take the time to conduct proper keyword research you will be able to target search phrases that can convert into sales. Successful and profitable keyword optimization and SEO campaigns need to be focused on keywords with a high return on investment. The time and money that you invest in a search engine marketing campaign must be weighed against any returns generated from the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/alive-to-god-blog/Alive_to_God_Blog-Targeting_your_SEO_-_Keyword_Research.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

I normally engage in some 3 hour sessions,foreplay and quickies daily with the odd group sex thrown in.

      <title>How to Decide if you Need to Outsource SEO</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is essential to implement a Search Engine Optimization strategy if you want your keyword search phrases to rank high on the search engine results pages(SERPs). One of the biggest decisions that a webmaster or website owner needs to make is whether to outsource SEO or to do it yourself. Effective SEO services costs a bundle and a lot of money could be saved by doing it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim of this article is to provide website owners with questions that, if&amp;#160; answered truthfully, will assist with the decision of whether to outsource your website SEO or not. The term "Search Engine Optimization" encompasses a wide variety of processes aimed at improving the position on the SERPs of your keyword search phrases. More organic search traffic will be received by your website if your keywords rank high on Google, Bing or Yahoo (preferably within the top 10).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questions to Ask: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you know about SEO?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you know what your current     website optimization levels are and what needs to be done to improve them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you capable of working     with simple HTML code?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you have the passion to     implement a search engine optimization strategy or is it just something     that you feel needs to be done?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Can you or one of your     employees afford to spend time on SEO without negatively impacting     on your customers and business?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you able to write quality     keyword rich content and/or articles?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are you capable of making     changes to your web pages if needed?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do you have the resources and/or     tools or do you know where to find them?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is your hourly rate and     what will the related monthly salary cost be if you spend a minimum of 10 hours a week on     your website SEO?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need more time than     expected to spend on research and implementing your SEO strategy, will you     have the time?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Will your monthly cost be     less than the cost of outsourced services (professional SEO services will     cost anywhere from $500 - $1 500 per month)?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you want to achieve?&amp;#160;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be advisable to outsource your SEO needs if you answered &lt;b&gt;no&lt;/b&gt; to more than 2 of these questions. Optimizing your website for Google, Yahoo and Bing is very important and should not be done halfheartedly. It is very important to do proper research and Wikipedia is a good starting point. Not all of the search engine optimization requirements have to be outsourced or done by yourself. Look at what you are comfortable doing yourself and outsource the rest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also very important to determine goals and to monitor the performance of your keyword search terms on the result pages. The level of SEO required for success will be determined in a big way by the competition that your keywords face. Very competitive markets and search terms will require more effort than less competitive niche markets or products. Considerall of your options carefully and make an informed decision. Remember that no one can make the decision except you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/alive-to-god-blog/Alive_to_God_Blog-How_to_Decide_if_you_Need_to_Outsource_SEO.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <title>SEO Link Building Made Easy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;SEO link building is the corner stone of a successful search engine optimization strategy. Every website needs to build links in order to be ranked by the search engines on the results pages. Link building can be frustrating and it is easy to build low value ineffective links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is SEO link building?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEO link building is defined as the process through which high value backlinks to your site are obtained from high ranking websites. Your keywords should always be used within the anchor text of the link to ensure maximum value. Links can be generated through advertisements, comments, articles, press releases, socialmedia or bookmarks on social sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why build links?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Search engines place a lot of importance on the quantity and quality of backlinks to a website. Links form a big part of the algorithm used by search engines to determine ranking and links from high volume websites have the ability to generate a lot of traffic to your website. Websites with a lot of quality links are seen as experts on their subject matter and will therefore rank high on the search engine result pages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can SEO links be build?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are numerous SEO link building methods that can be used to build backlinks.Some of the acceptable and widely used methods are:&amp;#160; &amp;#160; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article Marketing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very effective link building tool and can also be used to establish credibility. Articles should be written using your keywords (keyword density of3% - 6%) and should relate to your website, product or services. Always ensure that the links back to your website contains your keywords in the anchor text.Follow the guidelines and rules of the article directories when submitting articles to ensure that your articles are published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Comments on Blogs or Forums&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Links can be created by commenting on blog or forum posts. It is advisable to place a link back to your website in your username and not in your comment. This method of SEO link building has been abused and you may find that a lot of blogs and forums delete comments that do not add value. For maximum results it is advisable to comment on blogs or forums that relates to your website, service or product and that allows do-follow links. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reciprocal Links&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a good idea to have a few quality reciprocal links to high PR websites. When two websites link to each other it is called a reciprocal link. Always link to a website with a high PR&amp;#160; (page rank) that relates to your service or product. Links can be obtained through contact with the webmaster of the website that you want to link to and some websites have anautomated process. It is important to make sure of the PR of the page that links to you since not all website pages have the same PR.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One-way Links&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High value one-way links are the gold of SEO. The search engines allocate more value to one-way links than reciprocal links. Posting content (not comments) on popular blogs or high PR websites generate quality one-way links. Some blogs and websites allow guest posts and it is important to build a relationship with these type of sites. Always manage your links to ensure maximum value and only build links from established websites in good standing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Press Releases&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One-way links, awareness and traffic can be generated through press releases. This method has also been abused and the search engines are aware of this. Only submit a press release when you have something to share or announce and makesure that it is well written. You should ideally not submit more than 4 press releases in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Facebook and Twitter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting your website through Facebook and Twitter is a must. High quality links generating traffic to your website can be build through these sites. You can reach a lot of potential customers and improve your rankings by using these two sites effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bookmarks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another method that has been badly abused. One-way links can be build by bookmarking&amp;#160; your websites on various social sites. The value of these links have decreaseddue to abuse but it is still a viable SEO link building method.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Directories&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can build one-way links by submitting your website url to directories. Try to limit your submissions to directories with a high PR.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What not to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not make use of link farms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not build links from     banned sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not build links from     gambling or porno sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not build massive amounts     of links in a short period of time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do not use black hat     techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to a successful SEO link building strategy is to continuously build high quality links over a period of time. You should aim to build 10-20 links per day using a combination of methods. This should not take you more than an hour daily and is worth the effort. It is important to understand that SEO link building takes time and will not push your website to the number one position on the results pages overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/alive-to-god-blog/Alive_to_God_Blog-SEO_Link_Building_Made_Easy.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
