      <description>Hey,

We hope your well and looking forward to enjoying the Easter break.British summer time officially begins but unfortumately the U.K market is still over-cast.The message and questions in the press are beginning to become some what repetetive, which only highlights the level of uncertainty in the future of our property market.

It seems that no-one is safe, Buy-to-let landlords, interest only home-owners and even first time buyers in what you would assume would be the perfect condition to get their foot in the door are falling victim to the tight criteria of the risk adverse mortgage companies and excessively expensive arrangement fee's!

One great indicator to look for in predicting the market is to keep a close eye on the activities of the National House builders and developers in and around the country, (increased incentives to buy are a clear give away).Upon doing so it is clear to see that even the bigger players are struggling and taking an extra careful look at their bottom line.Persimmon Homes have made massive cuts in staff and are reluctant to increase their land bank and recently Taylor Wimpey reported massive lossess as a result of their American activities.Right across the board the share prices of house builders and developers have plumeted.

In a week where both Gold and Oil have fallen in value by 10% there was always going to be casualties and the U.K market is no exception.What is already clear is that sellers have no choice but to be realistic with their prices. Miles Shipside, commercial director of Rightmove, reckons that there is a large gap between sellers' expectation and buyers' ability to pay.The buyers lack of ability is down to many factors but as we mentioned before there is a distinct lack of lenders,around half the lenders to choose from compared to last year.

In a slow market we know how hard it is to find a buyer, if you want to increase the exposure of your property to over an extra 3.5 million buyers for a low cost one off fee register now at: http://www.propertyflaunt.com/register.php?si=1 it could'nt be easier!

Enjoy your Easter break!

Untill next time, Good luck in all your property persuits.

      <description>Hey!

Hope you have had a great month.

Well, as the U.K market continues its apparent descent one thing that appears to be growing is the presence of private house sales and peoples acceptance that private home selling is an effective and viable way to sell your home, this acceptance is further re-inforced by the massive savings to be had in terms of estate agents fee's saved.

More and more people have realised that to sell property privately all you need are: 

.Common sense
 
.Decent organisational skills 

.The desire to save a considerable sum of money 

Figures from the Office of Fair Trading show that 1 in 10 homeowners now attempt to sell property privately. 
The OFT interviewed a sample of these private sellers and their findings were dramatic:
 
91% reported the whole process ran extremely smoothly. Most said they would do it again.

Compare that to the findings of the Which? report which stated: 
50% of sellers who used Estate Agents were dissatisfied with the service they received.

There is even a recent study by the "Interactive in Media Retail Group", IMRG (The global e-retailing industry body) looking at the rise in popularity of selling a house privately. 
They forecast that by 2010 nearly half (that's 700,000) of all property sold in the UK each year will be without the help of a traditional Estate Agent. 

With todays market where properties are becoming increasingly harder to sell and competition is even greater people are beginning to try everything in a bid to find a buyer and are suprised to find that although they considered private house sales as a last resort it really does work in giving estate agents a run for their money, and in terms of value for money far eclipses the dated traditional moethod of house selling.

If you would like to save thousands whilst selling your house and moving on with your life sign up with www.propertyflaunt.com to expose your house to millions immediately.What will you spend the thousands on that you will save? A new Car, Holiday, Kithen? Dare to dream because with our cost cutting property solutions you can afford to!

Good Luck In all your Property Persuits!

Until next time.

      <title>UK Repossessions Expected to Soar in 2008 </title>

      <description>UK Repossessions Expected to Continue in 2008 

The news is unavoidable. No matter where you turn chances are good you'll hear talk of the serious problems UK property owners are facing. From upwardly adjusting mortgage rates to borrowers who are 30-, 60- and even 90-days in arrears to mortgage defaults and repossessions, UK property owners are taking a hit from all sides.

How bad will it get?

Many fear that the situation will get worse before it gets any better. Will it be as worse as it was back in the early 90s? That depends on whom you listen to. 

Some say the situation already is as bad while others insist that a return to this earlier scenario simply isn't possible. They point to 2 key differences as proof: Today's interest rates versus the double-digit rates that were common 15 years ago, and the recent run-up in home values that has helped property owners build equity which they can draw upon to help ease their burden.

It's nice to put a positive spin on the situation. However the thousands of property owners facing repossession would probably not agree with this sugar-coated news.

In an effort to ward off repossessions, most have already eliminated unnecessary spending. The cutbacks were enough for some however the continually increasing interest rates - along with escalating costs for petrol, utilities and other necessities - have made it impossible for others to afford higher mortgage payments. 

The belief that they would sell their property before their variable rate mortgages adjusted or use their home equity to refinance into a fixed rate mortgage has yet to turn into reality either. What is reality is that the downturn in the housing market has left a huge segment of property owners scrambling for relief, often to no avail. 

Tips to avoid repossession

Is there any hope for those property owners facing the possibility of repossession? Surprisingly, the answer is yes! Here are some tips that may help you avoid repossessions.

First, talk with your lender as soon as you think you'll have a problem making your mortgage payments. Don't wait until you fall behind on your payments. But even if you have, it's still important to discuss your situation with your lender straight away. Be honest and be realistic. 

Most lenders are willing to make alternate arrangements whenever possible because it costs time and money to enter into property repossession proceedings. If you are able to negotiate more favourable terms, be sure to uphold your end of the deal. 

Another option is to sell your home. If you take this approach realize that it'll be difficult to get the price you might have gotten for your property a year or two ago. Times have changed and you won't be the only one attempting to sell. 

However, if you can get enough from the sale of your property to pay off your debt you can avoid foreclosure and protect your credit from further damage. You'll then be able to make plans to start over without all the financial pressure.

Until next time,

Good Luck in all your Property persuits!

      <title>Is Now The Right Time For First Time Buyers?</title>

      <description>Hey!

Its been a busy start to the year as i'm sure it has been for you! Despite this, the news is still dominated by headlines explaining that the UK property market will be far from busy in 2008.That being said the question many are asking is 'Should first-timers rush now to buy now the door is half open?'

According to Jonathan Davis a chartered financial planner at Armstrong Davis and a contributor to the website Housepricecrash.co.uk,first-timers willing to resist temptation will be handsomely rewarded. He predicts that prices will tumble by around 35 per cent over the next five years, kicking off with falls of between 5 and 10 per cent during 2008. "My advice to those thinking about getting on the ladder is simple: don't touch property with a barge pole. A £250,000 home now will be worth £150,000 in as little as four years' time."

But Louise Cuming, head of mortgages at comparison site Moneysupermarket.com, has an altogether different view: "Putting the plan on hold and renting because prices 'may fall' means you are taking a gamble with economic probability rather than reaching for what you want. At the same time, you are lining the pocket of a landlord with money that could be going into your own home."

For the past several years, most first time buyers have had little hope of climbing that first rung on the property ladder. Soaring property values and the snapping up of available inventory by over-zealous investors have been difficult obstacles for first time buyers to overcome. 

But now that the UK property market is showing signs of cooling, 2008 might be the best time in a long time for first time buyers. If you've been sitting on the sidelines, now is the time to take action. There's a lot to do and you'll want to get it all done so you can make a firm offer the moment the perfect property comes onto market. 

Here's a checklist that'll help prepare you for that property ladder ascent:

Set aside money for the deposit AND buying costs

If you haven't done so already, now is the time to track all spending and cut any that doesn't get you closer to your goal of owning property. It's a lot easier to forgo those new shoes and CDs when you've got your priorities in order. Today 100% mortgages are a rarity. With lending standards tightening, lenders want to see that you're committed to property ownership and the best way to show that commitment is with an adequate deposit. 

How much is enough? Expect to put down about 20% of a property's negotiated selling price. Don't forget that you'll need additional funds to cover buying costs including solicitor fees, mortgage set-up fees, removals, and possibly stamp duty, too. 

Understand the mortgage options available for first time buyers

The Government understands the difficulties first time buyers face. That's why it has created several home ownership schemes targeted at this market. Some schemes are only available in certain areas or to certain groups so start researching your options now while you're not under any pressure. 

Some first time home ownership schemes worth investigating include: Conventional Shared Ownership; Do-It-Yourself Shared Ownership; Homebuy; Rent-to-Buy; Graduate; Guarantor First Time Buyer; and Key Worker Homebuy. There are others and only you know which is best for your situation. Learning the particulars of the various types of mortgages can be a daunting task, but the resulting knowledge is definitely well worth the investment of your time.

Get your credit in order

You won't be approved for any mortgage, regardless of the type, until a check of your creditworthiness is completed. If you haven't personally checked your credit history recently, do so now. Immediately start correcting discrepancies so lenders won't base their decisions on potentially incorrect information later on.

Have realistic expectations

Finally, be realistic so you don't end up with property and/or a situation that's not right. Decide what's important in your life. Do you want a shorter commute? Will you truly be comfortable co-owning property? Do you really have the time and money to make renovations on your newly purchased property? 

You'll never truly "settle" if you end up settling for the wrong property.If your a first time buyer and need guidance or questions answering head over to the Property Flaunt Forum , there will be someone over there delighted to help you!

Untill next time, Good Luck in all your Property Persuits!

If you haven&#8217;t personally checked your credit history recently, do so now. Immediately start correcting discrepancies so lenders won&#8217;t base their decisions on potentially incorrect information later on.</p>

<p><b>Have realistic expectations</b></p>

<p>Finally, be realistic so you don&#8217;t end up with property and/or a situation that&#8217;s not right. Decide what&#8217;s important in your life. Do you want a shorter commute? Will you truly be comfortable co-owning property? Do you really have the time and money to make renovations on your newly purchased property? </p>

<p>You&#8217;ll never truly &#8220;settle&#8221; if you end up settling for the wrong property.If your a first time buyer and need guidance or questions answering head over to the <a href="http://www.propertyflaunt.com/forums/index.php">Property Flaunt Forum</a> , there will be someone over there delighted to help you!</p>

<p>Untill next time, Good Luck in all your Property Persuits!</p>
