      <title>Does Your Dog Suffer Seperation Anxiety</title>
      <description>It's a pretty common problem - separation anxiety in dogs. There is the dog that looks a little put-out that the owner is leaving and not taking him, and then there is the dog that scratches through the screen on the window trying to get out of the house to follow his owner. The first example is natural, but the second is not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many reasons why a dog can have separation anxiety. Dogs from shelters have been abandoned once and may feel that they're being abandoned again. Dogs from pet stores can have anxiety because they've been taken away from their mothers too early. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some dogs become anxious about being separated after changes occur in their lives. There may be a change in the family dynamics with a new baby, a divorce, loss of a roommate, or the death of another pet. Frequent moves or a change in the owner's work schedule can bring on anxiety as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help the pet, owners should take the time to ease them into any new changes. If they've moved cross country, added a new spouse, or started working nights, they should take some time to give their dog extra attention. Play with them and walk them. Exercise helps relieve stress in dogs too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the pet owner has to work long hours, they should consider hiring a pet sitter to come in during the day for a half hour to walk and play with the dog. If this becomes the new routine for the dog he doesn't feel so isolated; he now has a friend to play with. Plus he's more likely to take a nap afterward than scratch at the door. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it helps to leave talk radio on or some low, soothing music.The radio can also cover up the sounds of people walking by outside, which can cause some dogs to go into a barking frenzy and become distressed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is helpful for the owner to say goodbye matter-of-factly. This is better than long, guilt-ridden, apologetic goodbyes because the pet will sense the owner's guilt and it will make the pet feel even worse. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing the owner can do is give the dog a job when he leaves. There are safe chew toys that can hold a treat that take some time for the dog to get out. Now they have a job to do while the owner is gone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Separation anxiety in dogs is a common problem, although the severity can differ. If your dog doesn't like it when you leave, try these tips. If the problem is severe, contact a dog behavioral specialist.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Organic Dog Food</category>
      <title>Why You Need To Start Feeding Your Dog Organic Dog Food</title>
      <description>The concern to eat healthy foods seems to equally apply to people and animals, since many pet owners prefer to purchase organic products to feed their four-legged friends. You would be shocked at all of the organic dog food offers available in supermarkets. Just like for people, there are certain health issues that one could put a stop to or prevent in the first place. Thus, organic dog food will reduce the risk of the pet developing dry skin diseases and allergies. The explanation for the good health impact is the absence of additives, chemicals, colorants or pesticides. Rather there will be just grain extracts and high quality proteins as ingredients of organic dog food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organic dog food also has more nutrients, and this aspect is reflected in the most relevant of ways in the higher levels of energy and the healthy weight of the dog. Regular dog food may cause diabetes and weight gain with all the other issues that come with these illnesses: back ailment, organ failure and decreased mobility. How can organic dog food help here? Well, organic food items for pets do not contain bulk fillers, they are nutrient-packed products that will give your pet energy not fat deposits. Yet, it is best and much easier to prevent health issues than to treat them afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good digestion and overall stronger immunity: these are other good benefits that come together with the use of organic dog food. Because of the deficiency of chemicals normally present in normal pet food, your dog will no longer vomit, experience gas or diarrhea. A healthier metabolism is thus what you will mainly achieve with a regular healthy diet. Then, the quality of the nutritional ingredients in organic dog food boosts up the imune system eliminating the risk for infections and all other issues of specific diseases that affect dogs on a common basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, veterinarian experts claim that with organic dog food, the life span of any animal can increase significantly, not to mention the fact that it will go a lot better through their aging years. Most of the time, pet owners that choose organic dog food, are also interested in applying the same health rules to their own diet, sticking to clean natural products that boost up body functions and keep intoxications and disease away. Ask your dog food provider about organic dog food, and if there is none available with the supermarket or your local pet store, try to buy it online. There are quite a few of web pages that sell such products at fairly low prices.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Cavalier King Charles Breed Standards</title>
      <description>Breed standards for the Cavalier King Charles call for it to be free from curl, with a slight wave permissible. In adulthood, Cavaliers grow lengthy feathering on their ears, chest, legs, feet and tail; Cavalier King Charles breed standards demand this be kept long, with the feathering on the feet cited as a particularly important feature of the breed. The breed standards have concentrated almost exclusively on the animals' appearance and paid little attention to temperament and breeders seeking easy money have bred from animals that were clearly physically or mentally unsound, in order to satisfy the enormous public demand for the currently 'fashionable' breeds. If you're looking to purchase a Cavalier King Charles make sure you get him/her from a reputable breeder. Always look at the parents to check out their health and also to see there temperament. Although through my experiences with the breed, I have never come across a Cavalier King Charles with a bad temperament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cavalier King Charles are a great breed to have especially for children . My niece and nephew are at my house quite often and they are a little rough with Rusty, only because they have big dogs at home, and Rusty just sits there and he takes it. I do let the kids know when I feel they are getting a little rough with him. Cavalier King Charles are affectionate and love their owners, they have been deemed the ultimate lapdog. They are also people pleasures and enjoy encouragements and prove to be eager learners and patient in training. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing I Love about Rusty is that very rarelly does he bark and he likes to be around me and other people.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>How To Housebreak Your Puppy</title>
      <description>&lt;div style='font-style:italic;' class='uawbyline'&gt;By Michelle Johnson&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class='uawarticle'&gt;Keeping your house spic and span with an untrained puppy is virtually impossible. If not properly trained both you and your puppy will not be happy.  Housebreaking your puppy is the first training you should do. Start off with a schedule and be consistent.  As creatures of habit, it is in their nature to keep schedules as pack animals.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; How Old Should My Puppy Be To Start Housebreaking&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The ideal age to start housebreaking your puppy is 8 to 12 weeks.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Crate Help&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Dog trainers suggest using a crate in housebreaking your puppy. A crate is like a cage, with see-through bars and a locking door. Its size should accommodate well the dogs size for it to move around in. It should be used like a dog's bedroom. It is advised to not confine your puppy in his crate for more than two hours at a time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The reasoning behind using a crate in housebreaking your puppy is that dogs will not dirty their sleeping areas. However, he may do so if you lock him in somewhere for longer than he can hold it in. Never use a crate to punish your dog, it will backfire. Generally, pups that are three-months old must eliminate every 3 hours, so you should lead him to a special outdoor comfort place more often. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Get Your Puppy Used To Routines&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When the training has progressed he will scratch on the door to let you know when he needs to go out.  Therefore, during the training process be sure to use the door you want him use.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Taking the puppy out at the same time everyday will help your dog to get into a routine.  This will help him to learn to hold it in until you are available.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Your Puppy Will Give You Clues&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If your puppy is left to roam around the house and you catch him in the act, stop him immediately and get him outside to finish his business.  Always praise him when he does something good.  Dog's love to please their owners. Praising him will go along way.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Patience is a Big Virtue&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Patience and consistency is the key to housebreaking your dog.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Using Your Common Sense&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Common Sense will help you and your dog while housebreaking. Stick to a routine, do not give him water before bed, to not ignore the clues. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Aside from patience and common sense, consistency is also one of the important factors of this dog training activity. If you suddenly forget about the routines yourself, don't blame if your dog if he starts committing accidents more often. Remember that the stakes are high. If you would like succeed in this housebreaking feat or just about in any other training drills, don't treat it as a game. Allot enough time and commitment on your part. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Best of luck!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='uawresource'&gt;&lt;div style='font-style:italic;' class='uawabout'&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 			About the Author:&lt;br /&gt; 		&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div  class='uawlinks'&gt;Michelle Johnson is highly respected in her community for her knowledge on how to care for and train your dog.

      <title>Preventing Your Dog From Catching Diseases</title>
      <description>Preventing your dog from catching diseases&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any other pet, dogs, if not properly cared for and maintained, can get diseases. Here are some parasites that cause dog diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Heartworm. Mosquito bites cause heartworm to exist in a dog and will reside in your pet’s heart and nearby blood vessels. A dog infected by heartworms looks dull and may even have a chronic cough. If possible, ask your veterinarian if your dog could be given a heartworm medication when it is the season of mosquitoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Hookworm. Hookworms can be given by the mother dog to a puppy during the nursing period or even before birth. Hookworms cause dog anemia and appetite loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Roundworm. The transmittal of roundworms is very much like how hookworms get transmitted in a dog. An infected dog usually has a potbelly. Roundworms cause pneumonia, diarrhea, dehydration, stunted growth, and vomiting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Tapeworm. A dog gets tapeworms if it swallows fleas that are larvae-laden. Much of the symptoms that are obvious rarely show, but in the dog’s feces, you could see deposits of a rice-like appearance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- Whipworm. A dog infected with whipworms may have diarrhea and other ailments like, stool mucus, and serious bowel inflammation. Extreme weight loss is also a symptom caused by whipworms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Fleas. Fleas, the commonest among external parasites, cause the dog to continuously scratch various parts of the body. This results to fur loss. Ask your veterinarian on a good flea-control program, since fleas could become resistant to some products over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lice. Lice can infect less common compared with fleas. Plus, they can be controlled easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ticks. Ticks can pose more serious problems than fleas because diseases like Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, or Lyme disease, can be contracted with ticks. Tweezers can be used to remove ticks one by one. If you do not know how to remove ticks properly and carefully, ask your vet first. If you do know how, ticks should be placed in a can with soap and water. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Treating dog diseases&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some ways of treating dog diseases that your vet might use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pills &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Liquid medicine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Eye drops and ointment&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ear drops and ointment &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With proper care and prevention, your pet dog will be generally free and safe from various diseases. If you notice something’s wrong with your dog or he is acting strangly, immediately consult with your vet.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Enjoyable Activities To Do With Your Dog</title>
      <description>Your dog is not just a pet it is your best friend, the one you can regularly count on when things just aren't going your way. Your dog is part of your family, a stress reliever and so much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To strengthen your bond with your dog it is of vital importance to spend quality time with your dog. Your dog will come to respect you as well as you will respect your dog. It emphasizes the communication between you and your dog. The best way to strengthen your bond is by walking the dog. Dogs naturally walk in the wild so it is of vital importance that you walk your dog. In order for your dog to respect you do not have the dog walk in front of you, he must stay beside you or behind you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While training your dog it is easy to get frustrated when you are too serious.There are many different ways you can train your dog to be obedient and/or to learn new tricks while making it more enjoyable for you and your dog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most dogs can spend a lot of time running after balls, sticks and Frisbees. It gives them great exercise and is also a challenge for them when they try to catch it..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like to do with my dog Rusty is to hide a treat in my backyard and have him find it. Not only does it teach him discipline to stay until I say go find but it also allows him to use his keen sense of smell to search for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is of vital importance to keep your dog happy and healthy. Use your imagination and you will come up with great ideas and fun games to play with you dog.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>The Dangers Of Overweight Dogs</title>
      <description>Maintaining the weight of you dog is of vital importance. Learning the dangers for your overweight dog will help you to say no if he wants that extra treat, start walking your dog every day, it will help you to take that extra step in helping him/her lose those extra pounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overweight dogs are in danger of injuring their knees if they overload the joint while running and turning, so take it easy. Overweight dogs are more prone to musculoskeletal, circulatory, liver, and pancreatic disorders. They have trouble cooling off in hot weather and are prone to heatstroke. Overweight dogs are more likely to develop diabetes, heart and respiratory problems and arthritis. Lower calorie levels in senior foods can help control the tendency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overweight dogs are likely candidates, but dogs of all sizes are affected. And while larger breeds are more prone to canine arthritis, all breeds and mixed breeds can develop it. Overweight dogs are also more likely to snore than those who are physically active. Overall, if your dog is snoring and it doesn't bother you then it is most likely not an issue to worry about but if you are bothered by it or the dog seems to be bothered then taking your dog to the veterinarian would be highly recommended. Overweight dogs are susceptible to a long list of health problems that fit and healthy dogs are not. Make sure you feed a good quality fresh diet and provide adequate exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diet is a fine thing, but without exercise it can only do but so much. All dogs need exercise, whether they are overweight or not. Diet meals with necessary nutrients should include the right combination of fiber, meat, vegetables, vitamins, and minerals in order for the dogs to stay healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight loss for most dogs involves increased exercise and eating food with fewer calories. It is generally easier to feed normal amounts of a low-calorie dog food than to feed much smaller amounts of his/her regular dog food. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight gain can also be a sign of that there could be a medical disorder occurring. Make sure you take your dog to the veterinarian before starting any kind of diet or exercise routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember a good dog is a happy and healthy dog.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

Dog ear infections are usually called Otits Externa; this means an infection in the outer ear.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Having your dog's nails clipped is of vital importance because long and overgrown nails force your dog to walk on the sides of their pads. Walking on concrete does help to file the dogs nails but might not be enough. Be sure to have them clipped once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most dog owners do not recognize the importance of keeping the dog's teeth free of tarter. Too much tarter can cause gum disease and loss of teeth. Have your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel get used to chewing on the tooth brush then gradually start brushing his teeth. Do not use human toothpaste, it is not meant to be swallowed and can cause harm to your dog. Always use dog toothpaste, you can purchase it at any pet store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bathing your dog once a week will keep him smelling nice, keeping him free of fleas and ticks. Brush him before his bath, use a mild dog shampoo and dog conditioner. Make sure to get his whole body including his face and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A professional groomer may be a consideration for some of the more difficult tasks such as clipping their nails. You can bring your Cavalier King Charles Spaniel into your local groomer or vet just to clip their nails. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just like with your own body, periodic grooming is necessary to keep your dog healthy. Remember a good dog is a happy and healthy dog.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Is the German Shepherd Right For You?</title>
      <description>A sound temperament is a must in a German Shepherd Dog (GSD).  The German Shepherd breed today is a far cry from the original flock dogs used in Germany in earlier times.  The German Shepherd Dog truly is a wonderful animal and not only do they make  good working dogs, they also make superb family pets.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The German Shepherd needs to be well socialised from an early age and needs  plenty of exposure to people and other dogs so that they do not develop aggressive  tendencies as they mature.  Most German shepherd kennels plan their litters well in advance and once you describe the kind of dog you want, they can guide you to the litter that best fits your needs.  If you want a dog who will be protective and loyal, then a German Shepherd may be the right dog for you and your family.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like us then you know that German Shepherds are one of the most loyal, intelligent, and protective breeds of dog there is.  Because no two breeds of dog are the same and the training required to bring out the best in your German Shepherd is not the same as say, the training needed by a Chihuahua, it is important that a program that is German Shepherd Training specific is used.  German Shepherd or GSD, also knows as Alsatian, is one of the most versatile dogs, who has excelled as a sentry and guard dog, police and army dog, tracker, drug detection dog, guide dog for the blind as well a s a search and rescue dog.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since Rin Tin Tin became a famous television personality, the German Shepherd has gone from an already popular dog breed to one of the most well known breeds on earth.  In this country and in Great Britain, the German Shepherd quickly became a popular show dog.  Training is essential--A German Shepherd dog quickly masters basic commands and will learn any trick or chore you want to teach him.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Ear Infection Symptoms</title>
      <description>Ear Infections are common in some breeds, especially Spaniels. Here are some simple ways for you to determine if your dog has an ear infection before taking your dog to the vet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you give your dog hugs, you can smell the special odor of a yeasty, bacterial, ear infection.  And, of course, if you take a close look, you will see that the ear canal is hot, red, inflammed, and full of goo.  It may be necessary to sedate your pet in order to clean out the ear well enough to get a good look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ear infections in dogs are just as painful to them as they are to humans. The dog may spend a lot of time rubbing his ears and/or scratching them. If you suspect an ear infection it is of vital importance to get him to vet right away. At that point the vet will administer medication. After a few days of treatment your vet will have you come back to look again when hopefully the ear will be improved.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">The Life Expectancy Of A Dog</category>
      <title>The Life Expectancy Of A Dog</title>
      <description>The following article includes pertinent information that may cause you to reconsider what you thought you understood. The most important thing is to study with an open mind and be willing to revise your understanding if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;The life expectancy of any dog is commonly expressed in terms of dog years. It depends entirely on the dog's breed, and size as well as the dog's surroundings. Various other factors affect the life expectancy of a dog. A dog's life span changes according to the diet provided to him and also by the number of medical problems the dog tends to face over the years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The average life span of the small dog like Chihuahua is about 15 to 16 years, while medium sized dogs like Border Collies have a life span of 10 to 13 years. It can be noticed big dogs like Great Dan live up to only 7 to 8 years. Calculating the life expectancy of a particular dog can be accurately done with the help of "size or the specific breed calculator," which is said to be one of the most accurate age approximate results about the dog's predictable lifespan based on the size as well as the breed of the dog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is generally assumed that, on an average, "one human year equals to seven dog years." This statement may not be appropriate, since the first two years are jointly represented by 18-25 years in such schemes and because the entire ratio cannot be generalized for all the dogs though, they belong to different sizes and breeds. An exact ratio of dog years vs. human year cannot be formulated. However, some obvious features remain similar between both aging humans and dogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find yourself confused by what you've read to this point, don't despair. Everything should be crystal clear by the time you finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is generally assumed that the human equivalent of a one-year dog is supposedly fully grown by both mental and physical aspects. Dogs like humans tend to develop advanced muscular features as they grow along with a similar mental development. Through a major dog study, it has been estimated for dogs of all breeds and sizes that, nearly "64 percent of dogs" were etherized because they were affected with some kind of diseases. Only 8 percent of the total dogs live beyond 15 years and nearly 16 percent of them die yearly due to heart diseases and cancer. Human lives are not terminated even if they suffer from rare and incurable diseases' and this is the main reason why the lifespan of an average human being is reasonably long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects of aging in dogs is said to be dormant for several years. But like humans, dogs do undergo physical changes as well. The first sign of aging in dogs is said to be the decrease in its activity levels. The sleeping period in these dogs also becomes longer. The canines experience a drastic change in their skin condition, limb usage, appetite and they experience tooth loss as well. Their sense of hearing and vision also diminishes gradually. Older dogs tend to experience stiffness in their body. All these obvious signs of aging can even be found in humans. The human years are extended only because of advanced modern medicine and various other drugs that are designed to deal with symptoms of old age. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs and humans may not have the same physiology, yet some obvious similarities can be noticed when both species age. Dog Years and Human Years may not be directly related by some advanced equation, but to the naked eye the equivalence of corresponding features of Dog Years and Human Years are quite visible.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't limit yourself by refusing to learn the details about life expectancy of a dog. The more you know, the easier it will be to focus on what's important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.onlywire.com/submit?u=http://rustydogblog.blogspot.com&amp;t=The Life Expectancy Of A Dog&amp;tags=dogs life dog" title="Add this Article to Onlywire" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.onlywire.com/i/onlywire.ico" align="absmiddle" border="0" /&gt; Add to Onlywire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Balance Diet For Your Dog</title>
      <description>Balance Diet For Your Dog&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This article explains a few things about balance diet for your dog, and if you're interested, then this is worth reading, because you can never tell what you don't know.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Your dog needs a balanced diet of protein, carbohydrates and fats to maintain good general health, a healthy skin and coat, and plenty of energy. Broad guidelines are: 20-25% protein, 20-35% fat and 40-60% carbohydrate. Like humans, they need vitamins and minerals, though unlike us their need for vitamin C is satisfied by their ability to synthesize it for themselves. Essential vitamin B1, however, is not stored by dogs, and can be lost in food processing. It may need to be supplied as a supplement. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the most important aspects of a subject are not immediately obvious. Keep reading to get the complete picture.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Just feeding your dog lean meat does not satisfy these guidelines. In nature, dogs will eat all of their prey, including fat and the contents of the gut, which as a whole provides close to this ideal balanced diet. In fact, dogs in the wild have been observed to prefer to eat the gut of their prey first. Studies have confirmed this preference in domestic dogs, by showing they generally prefer their food cooked, warm, wet and ground up rather than in raw meaty chunks. Dogs are not delicate eaters, however. As natural scavengers, they will eat almost anything when they are hungry, and will naturally gulp down large meals quickly when food is available. Their ancestors never knew when next they might get an opportunity to eat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commercially processed and balanced dog food is commonly fed to dogs to help meet their ideal requirements, incorporating the necessary vitamin and mineral supplements. Often these foods come in dry form for ease of storage, or in cans or sausages, and offer a simple and convenient solution that is popular with a high proportion of dog owners. The commercial pet food business is today a huge industry. Store bought commercial dog foods are not always cheap, however. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative for dog owners is to mix their own balanced dog food diet. It's tricky to get the right combination of the right foods. Human diet guidelines are not necessarily appropriate. You will have to read up on the subject to know what you are doing. To give one example of the unique dietary issues to consider, including too much dried skim milk powder could cause scouring because of its high lactose content that dogs find difficult to digest. Recipes that offer guidance are readily available should you choose to take this approach. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs like to chew on large bones, but small bones and cooked bones that may splinter should be avoided. They are a common cause of death for dogs when ingested. Cooked chicken, lamb chop and fish bones are especially dangerous. Scraps from the table are always popular with dogs, and feeding your dog after you have eaten is one of the strategies you should adopt to assert your "alpha" position in the "pack". But do watch out not just for small bones, but also for other dangers food scraps may contain, like toothpicks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An aspect of dog behavior is that they will learn to associate a particular food with a bad experience, such as a digestive upset, and, as a natural survival instinct, may never eat it again. This may explain the frustrating and mysterious aversions to some foods that dog owners occasionally observe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feeding your seemingly ravenous dog is a little more complicated than it appears to be at first glance, but rarely presents any difficulty once you are aware of the unique food requirements of dogs.  &lt;br /&gt;       &lt;br /&gt;Don't limit yourself by refusing to learn the details about balance diet for your dog. The more you know, the easier it will be to focus on what's important.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>The Benefits Of Owning A Dog</title>
      <description>The Benefits Of Owning A Dog&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; When you think about benefits of owning a dog, what do you think of first? Which aspects of benefits of owning a dog are important, which are essential, and which ones can you take or leave? You be the judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Need A Little Help With Your Health? Get A Dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are considered man's best friend. But did you know that having a dog gives you several heath benefits?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In studies done by medical professionals, dog owners benefit from their pet's presence in several ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Improved cardiovascular health - Dog owners have been proven to have blood pressure and cholesterol lower than ordinary people. These factors reduce the chance for cardiovascular diseases. Stroking a pet has long been known to reduce blood pressure. A study from the New York State University found that these benefits continue even without the pet available. The study tested a group of stockbrokers with hypertension. They concluded that just being a pet-owner can lower blood pressure. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dog owners also have blood cholesterol levels lower than normal. Five thousand four hundred people were tested by the Baker Medical Research Institute of Australia and with the results showing pet owners having not just lower blood pressure but also lower levels of blood triglycerides and cholesterol compared to people who didn't own any pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now that we've covered those aspects of benefits of owning a dog, let's turn to some of the other factors that need to be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 2) Faster recovery time and higher survival rates - Hospital studies have found that seniors and recently operated on patients responded better to treatment and got better quickly while they were in contact with dogs and other therapy animals. Just petting a dog can be relaxing and therapeutic for recovering patients. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, dog owners have a greater chance to survive after suffering from a serious illness. Several studies have discovered that pet owners who suffered from a heart attack were more likely to be alive a year after they were discharged from the hospital than those who did not own pets.  Another New York study found that pet's affected their survival rate more even more than the presence or company of family members or friends. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Fewer visits to the doctor - Studies conducted at Cambridge and UCLA have found that owning a pet corresponds to overall improved health and less need for hospital visits. A Medicare study of its elderly patients also discovered that those who own dogs visit the doctor less than those who don't have a pet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Mental Wellness - Patients who have dogs have also been known to have better emotional health than their counterparts. They offer unconditional love and affection; their presence alone helps reduce loneliness for sick people who have otherwise been isolated. Several studies of people with major illnesses have shown that the stress of fighting the disease is significantly reduced when they had a dog as company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, having a dog is a great investment, for the joy that you get from owning one and the health benefits that you can receive. So go out and get a dog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Of course, it's impossible to put everything about benefits of owning a dog into just one article. But you can't deny that you've just added to your understanding about benefits of owning a dog, and that's time well spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.onlywire.com/submit?u=http://rustydogblog.blogspot.com&amp;t=The Benefits Of Owning A Dog&amp;tags=owning a dog health benefits" title="Add this Article to Onlywire" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.onlywire.com/i/onlywire.ico" align="absmiddle" border="0" /&gt; Add to Onlywire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>The Importance of Dog Toys</title>
      <description>Dog Toys&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether your dog has run of the house or spends his days in a crate, it�s best to provide your dog with safe toys that will help alleviate boredom, and eliminate destructive behavior while you are away.  Choosing the appropriate toys will make your small dog's play time richer, while lessening his chance of accidental injury.  The best remedy to this dilemma is to get your puppies a few dog chew toys.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plush dog toys are cute and fluffy, and your puppies can carry them one place to another.  Interactive treat toys are made from extremely tough plastic, and are designed to engage your dog while you are away.  No matter what small dog toys you select for your pet, keeping these main safety points in mind should help you choose appropriate toys for your small dog that leave him happy and entertained -- and safe.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your pet dog is an expert at destroying dog toys, keeping a stock will save you the worry of buying a toy every time you turn around.  This is where you will place all the toys of your dog.  There are many plush toys available in the market today which you can give to your dog.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soft plush toys are not necessarily the best toy in the spectrum for the destructive dog; unless you want to spend endless hours cleaning up the stuffing.  With all the mentioned dog toys above, you will be 100% assured that purchasing toys for your dogs would be a lot easier and simple.  If your dog is very energetic and needs an hour or more of play daily, with or without their owners, they need toys that stand up to a lot of abuse.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying dog toys at wholesale prices gives huge discounts and a whole lot of toys.  Stuffed and furry dog toys are not too recommended.  The variety of dog toys lining market shelves include both hard and soft rubber balls, dental health toys, rope, fetch toys, talking toys, rubber rings and the puffy and furry ones.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation for every dog owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.kingdomofpets.com/dogobediencetraining/?aff=michelleo1&amp;type=nohop"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.kingdomofpets.com/dogobediencetraining/images/sitstayfetchbook2.jpg" width="124" height="180" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>Taking Care Of Your Dog's Teeth and Gums</title>
      <description>Clean teeth and gums are very important to the overall health of your dog. I have made a list of some information on the most common dental problems in dogs and ways of treating them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common dental problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Periodontitis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very common among dogs to have gum disease. At the age of two or three, many dogs have either periodontitis or gingivitis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most common dental problem for canines is periodontitis, also known as periodontal disease. The disease is caused by various factors: plaque, food debris, cell mucus, and a mixture of bacteria. This results in a film characterized by milky-white on the dog's teeth as well as the gums. When this film gets combined with saliva, the plaque it causes becomes tartar, and very hard to remove. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Gingivitis &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gingivitis, also known as gum disease, happens when gum tissue suffers from an inflammation. Without treatment, it can lead to periodontitis, teeth loosening, bone loss, and ultimately, loss of teeth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Tooth fractures&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tooth fractures occur when dogs chew hard substances, such as hard rocks. The fractures result to infection inside the broken tooth, which is known as the endodontic disease.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;How to prevent dental problems&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your dog can fight off these dental problems by removing the plaque before it actually develops as tartar. How to do it? The most effective way is by brushing the teeth of your dog in a mechanical fashion. The brushing would reduce much of the bacteria presence in the mouth, not to mention making your dog's breath smell sweeter. Make it a habit of brushing your dogs' teeth on a daily basis. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Toothpaste. There are toothpaste products made especially for dogs. Brush your pet's teeth using dog toothpaste. Human toothpaste is specifically designed for humans to spit the paste washings out. Dogs cannot do that, so it is imperative to have a dog toothpaste that is safe enough for dogs to swallow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush. Using a toothbrush in its teeth will take some time for the dog to get used to. Let your dog be acquainted and get used to this is by putting some garlic salt, mix the salt with water, and dip the solution in an old toothbrush. Hold the old brush, and let your pet taste and chew it. Your dog will start to realize that chewing a toothbrush is and tastes good. Make it a habit a few times, until he feels comfortable brushing with it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finger brush. You could also use a finger brush instead of a toothbrush. A finger brush is a good alternative. The finger brush just fits onto your fingertip and can let you brush the dog's teeth without the dog knowing it. The disadvantage of getting a finger brush to clean your dog's teeth is that its bristles are quite large, therefore, making it difficult for the brush to go under the gumline as effectively with a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Professional cleaning. If you don't want to do the cleaning by yourself, you could take your dog to a veterinarian and have his teeth professionally cleaned. A good veterinarian will take additional measures in ensuring your dog's clean teeth by anesthetizing your dog, scraping the buildup of plaque from all over the gumline areas, and polishing the teeth for a sparkling finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home checkup. Try to make it a regular habit of checking the teeth of your dog for any cracked or broken teeth. If you see some problematic teeth, check promptly with the veterinarian. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home safety. Of course, cleaning your dog's teeth does not mean you should disregard other areas of concern. Tough substances, such as bones, rocks, hard nylon, or anything you think may be dangerous to your dog's teeth should be removed from areas where your dog could see. Buy your dog chewing toys that are safer like rubber-made toys. You could also provide bones that are soft enough for your dog to chew. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mouthwash. There are some products in the market that deal very well in helping to kill the bacteria in your dog's mouth and could actually help heal damaged gum tissues. Do not forget to ask your veterinarian on the best products in the market. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dental problems do not only happen to humans. Dogs also have dental issues as well. It is up to the owners to help their pet dogs overcome their dental problems.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>How To Keep Your Pet Safe Through The Holidays</title>
      <description>The "end of the year" holidays can present some particular hazards to the health of your pet, and consequently to your peace of mind. The following are some ways to make sure your pet is healthy and safe throughout the holidays. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you check your vet's holiday hours and emergency contacts and have the information easily accessible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think before you decorate with plants. Cats, dogs and birds will all nibble household plants, and many, including mistletoe and some poinsettias, can make your pet very ill. Make sure your holiday plants are out of your pet's reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same is true if you have a Christmas tree. You should put only unbreakable decorations at the bottom of your tree, so there is no danger of your cat's batting a glass ball and breaking it, or your dog chewing on one of your special ornaments or more dangerously a glass ornament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cats love to climb tress, make sure that your Christmas tree is securely in it's stand and if at all possible try and keep the cat out of the room where the tree is. I know that's not easy, but it is better than having your cat knocking down the tree. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another oft-forgotten item: if you have a live tree in water, wrap the base so your pets can't decide to take a drink of that water and keep the birds away from the tree.  Many modern live trees have been sprayed with chemicals that may be toxic to your pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very, very careful about candles. Your cat or bird may be enticed by the flicker of the flame, and may singe his whiskers or tail.  Place glass "hurricane lanterns" or other attractive covers over candles to protect your home and your pets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think ahead to New Years Eve, and plan how to keep your pets from becoming frightened by the traditional firecrackers and other noise makers. Some dogs may be severely traumatized by fireworks, be sure to leave them inside if you go out to celebrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pets, especially cats, may be stressed by the changes in household routine during the holidays, especially if you are stressed yourself. Some cats and dogs respond to stress by becoming hyper or hysterical, and some simply retreat. Plan to spend some special time with your pets to calm yourself and reassure them during this period, and if your pet is especially upset with strangers visiting, prepare a "refuge" he can go to and escape the crowd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Holidays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following is a list of refrences for your review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.supercoolpets.com/archives/2007/11/super_cool_pets_holiday_gift_g_2.php" rel="nofollow"&gt;Super Cool Pets Holiday Gift Guide Update-- 2007 | SuperCoolPets.com - Supe..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cooldoghalloffame.com/dogs/petsmartr-experts-speak-2007s-top-holiday-gifts-for-pets-revealed/1245" rel="nofollow"&gt;PetSmart(R) Experts Speak: 2007&amp;#039;s Top Holiday Gifts for Pets Revealed ..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dog-trainers.us/blog/?p=34" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Dog-Trainers.us Business Weblog  &amp;raquo; Blog Archive   &amp;raquo; Healthy..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://pets.hidesertweb.com/pet-health-tips/10-holiday-tips-for-your-pets.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;10 Holiday Tips for Your Pets | Pets Are Family Too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://healthierdogs.com/other-pet-articles/holiday-gift-for-pet/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Holiday Gift for Pet | Dog Health Care by Dog Health Enthusiast Brigitte Sm..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.prettypawsstylin.com/its-a-wonderful-dogs-and-cats-life-owners-pamper-pets-with-holiday-gifts-the-journal-news/5382" rel="nofollow"&gt;It's a wonderful dog's (and cat's) life; owners pamper pets with holiday gi..&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://madgoatlady.com/2007/11/19/holidays-fun-and-pets/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Holidays, fun and pets. : Mad Goat Lady&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://puppyintraining.com/?p=24" rel="nofollow"&gt;Puppyâ€¢Inâ€¢Training &amp;raquo; Puppy Adoption - A Home for the Holidays&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.busy-moms-online.com/595/how-to-pet-proof-your-holidays-2/" rel="nofollow"&gt;How to Pet-Proof Your Holidays - Busy Moms Online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://popartpet.com/blog/2007/11/17/christmas-is-going-to-the-cats/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Christmas is going to the cats! | Pop Art Pet Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>How To Change Your Dog's Diet</title>
      <description>As more and more new findings about dog's diet coming to the surface, many dog owners will begin to consider changing the dog's so that the dog will have good health and live a long and healthy life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's however very important for any dog owner to take cautions when trying to change a dog's diet. The following 5 steps are suggested such that it can be done effectively without throwing the dog off balance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 1: If you are the new owner of the dog or moving to a new location, it's best not to change the dog's diet right away. At this point you want to avoid too much unnecessary emotional strain on the dog. Once the dog has got accustomed to the new owner or living environment, then it would be the right time to change the dog's diet as planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 2: When it comes to changing the dog's diet, it should be done by replacing only 25% of the old food with the new one. Most dogs would not be able to notice any difference if the old and the new are mixed well enough. They should eat the new mixture as well as the old diet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although some dogs might not get used to the new diet initially, patience should be taken to allow for the break-in period to complete. It has taken the dog many months to get used to its old diet; therefore, for the dog to accept a new one it might sometimes take as long. As soon as the dog is eating 25% of the new mixture of diet, then it is safe to proceed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 3: Mix and replace 50% of the old diet with the new this time and make a little less effort to hide the new diet from the dog. Your dog should now be more receptive to the new food presented in the new mixture. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 4: At this time 75% of the new food be substituted with the old one. And make an even lesser effort to hide the new food from the dog. At this stage, the dog should accept this newly mixed diet without hesitation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Step 5: At this point, the dog should be accepting the newly mixed and replaced diet without any problem at all. Just like humans, all dogs are uniquely different and some are bound to require more patience and attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, don't become discouraged too easily when the dog is not fitting into the new diet in the beginning. Dogs are so sensitive that they'd be able to feel that they have done something when they feel the emotions of you their owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After all, changing a dog's diet is often a time consuming process that should be done with care and understanding.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>5 Things You Should Know Before Buying Your First Puppy</title>
      <description>Your kids want a puppy. All your neighbors have dogs. It’s the great American Dream (for children, anyway) to have a dog like Lassie. However, if this is your first puppy, there are some things you need to know before you commit to buying a dog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#1 - Dogs Take Time. Puppies Take More Time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having a puppy is like having a 2-year-old. Until they are trained (see #2), they require pretty much constant supervision. After they are trained, they still require supervision until they are older. Much older. If you can't entertain them all day, you may want to consider two dogs, or a cat. Or puppy day care! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#2 - Puppies Need Training. And so do your children. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was growing up, we had a dog - for a while. It didn't work out because my parents didn't realize that puppies need training. We were a cat family - and you can pretty much ignore cats. Not so with dogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need several puppy classes and possibly more classes when your puppy is grown. Dogs are not independent, and you need to teach them proper behavior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have children, they need to take the classes with their puppies so they can learn how to interact with your new pet. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#3: Puppies Cost Money. Lots of Money. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok - this isn't unreasonable, but you need to be prepared to add your puppy into your budget. You will have many expenses, especially when you first get your new puppy. They need toys, bones, shots, registrations with the state, and don't forget the food, dog houses, collars, clothes (no really - it’s a big business - you'll be tempted!) vet bills, and training (see #2). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs are one of the most expensive pets around. Most puppies are part of the family - and will cost you like part of the family. Don't go into this venture thinking they're cheap. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#4 - Puppies Grow Into Dogs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that's obvious - but you need to be sure you know how big your dog will be. If you have young children, your puppy may outweigh them within a year. Do the research so you know how big your cute little puppy will be when he's a dog. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your pet is a mixed breed dog, look at the paws. Usually, a puppy will grow into their paws. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#5 - Dogs Need Exercise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people need exercise - so this can actually be an advantage if handled properly. Puppies need room to run and play. They need people to play with, and they need toys to play with. If you lead a very sedentary lifestyle, be sure you pick a dog breed that is low activity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger the dog, the more room and exercise they need. You will probably need to walk your dog several times a week. Be sure and plan that into your schedule now - or you may find your puppy running around the house all day without you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owning a dog can be a very rewarding experience - even if this is your first puppy. Your dog will become one of the family and be a faithful companion for life. Be prepared for your new puppy, and it will be a great adventure for both of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.onlywire.com/submit?u=http://rustydogblog.blogspot.com&amp;t=5 Things You Should Know Before Buying Your First Puppy&amp;tags=dogs pets" title="Add this Article to Onlywire" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.onlywire.com/i/onlywire.ico" align="absmiddle" border="0" /&gt; Add to Onlywire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>The Truth About Pit Bulls</title>
      <description>Deciding to add a Pit Bull terrier to the family is a big step. Owning and raising a Pit Bull terrier is extremely rewarding, but it is vital that you become a responsible owner and invest the time and energy needed into your new pup. As a Pit Bull owner, I know first hand how good it makes your pet feel to get those special treats, and how hard it is to not give them when it results in getting the loving look that only your Pit Bull can give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When training your Pit Bull, it is important to remember that they can be very stubborn and hard to deal with at times. The first type of training you must do is crate training. Make his crate "his" special place, not for punishment. They are easily trainable if you take the time have the patience. No matter what type of training you do with your Pit Bull, you both should enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;By allowing your Pit Bull to eat food other than dog food, you are encouraging him that it is okay to eat whatever he wants. If you give in when your Pit Bull begs for your food, especially if you are at the table, he will think that behavior is okay, and will associate it with getting what he wants, table food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to keep your Pit Bull exercised. Walk the dog for about 45 minutes to an hour each day. There are plenty of toys you can buy for your dog to keep his mind exercised, balls are popular with almost any dog, again the important thing here is to purchase one that is made of material durable enough to hold up to your Pit Bull. Due to the strength of the Pit Bull, it is important to purchase tough toys that are made to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With proper training, your dog can be a part of your family with no worries. They are most intelligent and lovable dogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.onlywire.com/submit?u=http://rustydogblog.blogspot.com&amp;t=Rusty The Dog&amp;tags=pit bulls dogs" The Truth About Pit Bulls="Add this Article to Onlywire" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.onlywire.com/i/onlywire.ico" align="absmiddle" border="0" /&gt; Add to Onlywire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

      <title>All I Did Was Change His Food!</title>
      <description>My dog Rusty is very lazy. He was sleeping all of the time. He is turning 2 this month. I walk him routinely, I take him outside to play ball. I couldn't figure out why he was so lethargic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is very picky with his dog food, I found only one dog food that he likes. One day I was in the super market and I decided to change his dog food. I had gotten him a all natural dry dog food. I mix it in with his wet food and he loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is now full of energy and always on the go. I can't believe that by just getting a better dog food would increase his energy. I found this book on the &lt;span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0"&gt;Internet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://michelleo1.68dogs.hop.clickbank.net/"&gt; 68 Dog Food Ingredients To Die For&lt;/a&gt; and it lists 68 harmful ingredients found in commercial dog foods. I couldn't believe how many manufactures of dog food have one or more of these ingredients in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would like to know more I recommend this &lt;a href="http://michelleo1.68dogs.hop.clickbank.net/"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. My Rusty dog has more energy and I feel like I just did something good for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a happy and healthier dog just by changing his food.&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://del.icio.us/feeds/js/michj?title=my%20del.icio.us;icon;name;showadd"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
