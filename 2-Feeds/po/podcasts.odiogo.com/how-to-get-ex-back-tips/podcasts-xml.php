      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Get Over a Break Up &#8211; What To Do To Mend a Broken Heart</strong></p>
<p>Unless you have been lucky, you have probably been badly hurt when a relationship ended. Just what is the remedy for a broken heart?</p>
<p>Your first step is to see if your relationship can be salvaged. Sometimes in the heat of the situation we can do things we later regret. Perhaps you dumped your other half but now think you were too hasty. Perhaps she or he might be willing to get back with you?  If you now feel that this is the relationship that is meant for you, then you should not be afraid to ask for another chance.</p>
<p>Often you have both said things that you later regret. Couples can come under severe stress due to financial worries, concerns over children, health and not to mention job related stress. The consequences can result in you both treating each other unfairly, which leads to a break up. If you decide that this is one of the main reasons why you broke up with each other, then you should weigh up if you can overcome these problems and save your relationship. If this is the case, then you can find impartial help and advice at places that offer relationship counselling. It is worth a shot as getting back together with your loved one is a very good remedy for a broken heart.</p>
<p>Sometimes though, a relationship ends and it is final. You might be feeling that you will never get over the pain, but in time you will feel better. The time after a painful breakup is a period of grieving. Allow yourself time to grieve for what you have lost; but then acknowledge it is time to move on.</p>
<p><object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/kXxzpcc035E&#038;hl=en_GB&#038;fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/kXxzpcc035E&#038;hl=en_GB&#038;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></p>
<p>This is a time for looking after yourself. You can take a holiday, or get away to catch up with family or friends you haven&#8217;t seen for a while. Change your daily routine. Your life will be different now so instead of approaching it with fear, grab this opportunity with both hands. With a positive attitude your new life and love could be just around the corner.</p>
<p>Sure, partners who meet when they are teenagers and are still together in their eighties are great. But there are other twosomes out there who may have made mistakes in their respective pasts, but have now found happiness again.</p>
<p>We change as people as we travel through the journey of life. Our partner also changes, and we have to both adapt to the change in our relationship if we are going to be able to stay together. If your relationship has ended because you have moved in different directions, then you may be happier with someone else anyway.</p>
<p>If you find that your heartbreak is overwhelming, please speak to someone. There are many places you can find good advice and help for dealing with a broken heart. Think about offering help to others who need it, as well. Assisting others such as those who are sick in hospital can help you take your mind off your own problems.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you feel that you&#8217;re in a loveless marriage or your marriage has taken a nose dive, you many be asking yourself &#8220;How can I get my husband to fall in love with me again? This article will address some ways that can help you win back the heart of your husband (if you&#8217;ve really lost it, that is).</p>
<p>If you happen to be in what you feel is a &#8220;loveless marriage&#8221;, you should understand that if your husband is there, he probably still does love you. &#8220;Falling out of love&#8221; is a term that is often applied to hum-drum marriages but what it frequently means from the man&#8217;s point of view is that he has fallen out of love with the way the marriage is going. Your husband may have pulled away from you because he is not happy but can offer no more detailed explanation for his feelings. Men have a hard time accurately interpreting and then communicating what they are feeling. Even if they can&#8217;t put words to it, what they are often feeling is the relationship doesn&#8217;t make them feel good about themselves anymore. </p>
<p>When you first started your relationship, you were both putting your best foot forward and putting a lot of time and effort into making the other person feel good about you and about themselves. </p>
<p>So your relationship became stronger and both you and your husband felt wanted, important, interesting and competent, just to name a few. For men, these feelings are what makes him feel like he is in love. So, it&#8217;s important to understand that when your husband says (or you think) he doesn&#8217;t love you anymore, that might not be true. It&#8217;s very likely that he&#8217;s actually mourning the loss of the relationship that made him feel so great about himself.</p>
<p>So, now that you know this. . .what can you do? First, you get it all out. Tell your husband that you are feeling a distance in your marriage and you miss the closeness and intimacy that you both once enjoyed.  Ask him if he wants to improve your marriage. This could scare him because he thinks it will take a lot of work but don&#8217;t worry about that. The goal here is to communicate your desire to your husband.</p>
<p>Then you show him that he&#8217;ll probably like what you have in mind. Define what you miss in your relationship. If that happens to be more affection, then show more real affection to your husband. If you want more appreciation, let him know you appreciate him first. Sure, you have to take the first steps, but in time, you&#8217;ll see that he responds. It&#8217;s not unusual in the beginning that your husband will just look at you funny or totally reject your attempts. This will probably be hard on your ego but don&#8217;t give up! You&#8217;ll see in time that you&#8217;ve found the answer to &#8220;How can I get my husband to fall in love with me again?&#8221;</p>
<p> <a href="http://howtogetexbacktips.com/making-up.php">CLICK HERE</a> for a step by step recipe for getting your husband to fall in love with you again and get him eating out of the palm of your hand. FInd out exactly <a href="http://howtogetexbacktips.com/making-up.php">what a man craves in a relationship</a> (it&#8217;s NOT what you think!) and how to ensure he only has eyes for YOU.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you feeling like everything you do pushes your ex away further? Is this describing your situation to a tee? Are you asking &#8220;What can I do to get my ex boyfriend back&#8221; at every turn? Here are some tips that will greatly improve your chances of getting back together with your ex boyfriend.</p>
<p>Obviously right now you are serious about saving or rekindling your relationship, which is what led you to this article in the first place. But if you are feeling overly anxious to get your ex back, you may be behaving in the wrong way, causing your ex to pull away naturally. It is human nature in general to resist this kind of pressure. Struggling against human nature is completely pointless, and it will only make matters worse.</p>
<p>Are you calling your ex too much, constantly writing him e-mails or text messaging him? Are you trying to make him feel sorry for you? If you are doing these things, stop! If you are asking yourself &#8221; What can I do to get my ex boyfriend back&#8221;, then you need to stop doing these things right now.</p>
<p>So what can you do to get your ex boyfriend back? Follow this strategy instead.</p>
<p>You are going to need to take a completely fresh approach. Begin by breaking contact off for a while, doing your own thing. During this time where there is no communication between you and your ex boyfriend, you can focus on ways that you can improve your own personal life, rather than focusing on the relationship issues at hand. This is going to be a challenging time, and it is going to require discipline to prevent you from returning to your old ways.</p>
<p>During this time, your ex is going to experience a shift in how he feels about you, since you will no longer be pursuing him. You may become mysterious to him in some ways, because he is not sure what you are doing or feeling. This is actually something that can work in your favor. Now your ex is in a position to actually miss you, which is not possible when you are smothering him.</p>
<p>You must remember that the key to this strategy and repairing a break up is to work with human nature rather than attempting to work against it. If you are wondering &#8221; What can I do to get my ex boyfriend back&#8221;, now you should have a fairly basic understanding on how common mistakes can be avoided. Once you implement this basic strategy you can restore a balance and allow your ex to remember why he loved you in the first place.</p>
<p>Just keep yourself grounded and avoid smothering him. Make yourself appear mysterious and he will be reminded why he loved you in the first place. Play hard to get (don&#8217;t over do it) and let him make the first move, and you will come out on top.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to take the next step in your long term plan of <a href="http://howtogetexbacktips.com/making-up.php">getting your ex boyfriend back</a> and keeping him for good.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Have you been thinking about writing a let&#8217;s get back together letter to your ex? Here are a few tips of how to handle things if your ex has just ended things with you. The trick is to actually give permission for your ex to be free. Sounds weird, doesn&#8217;t it, but this is actually just the first step in the overall plan to get your ex back. But you need to make the right moves at the right time to get your ex back for good this time. Visit <a href="http://howtogetexbacktips.com/making-up.php">This site</a> for the <em>next step</em> you must take in the plan to get your ex back for good.</strong></p>
<p><u>Should I Write A Get Back Together Letter?</u></p>
<p>It’s that moment we all dread, even if at times we’ve seen it coming; your soon-to-be ex tells you that your relationship is over. In this confused state you are often coping with the loss of the one you love whilst trying to work out how to get them back. Even though you are feeling anxious and miserable, try to refrain from contacting your ex asking questions about the break up &#8211; they need some space right now.</p>
<p>The most crucial time is immediately after you have broken up. What you say and do at this time can really affect your chances of getting your ex back.</p>
<p>First off, the very best thing you can do is to agree with your ex that breaking up is a good idea. Your ex will not be anticipating this type of reaction, as strange as it may seem to you. This response has been proved to be incredibly effective.</p>
<p>So you are beyond the point of giving your ex some space and have been constantly calling or texting them? Don&#8217;t worry, there is one thing you can do that will guarantee to redeem some of your behavior in the eyes of your lost love.</p>
<p>This requires a bit more effort on your part, but your worth can increase ten fold in the eyes of your ex. This is what you should do. Write them a short letter telling them that you have been giving things some thought and that the were right to want to break up. You will come across as accepting and calm which is much more appealing to them than being desperate and needy.</p>
<p>The letter must be very brief and the only thing you should say is that you agree with the break up. Just make sure you write an actual letter and not just text them or call them on the phone. Or worse, tell them face to face.</p>
<p>Do you wonder why this works much better than just a simple &#8220;let&#8217;s get back together&#8221; letter? Well, you&#8217;re actually complimenting your ex, by agreeing with them and letting them know in a very physical, real way that they have actually been heard. If you have been sending hundreds of text messages, or calling them constantly, another phone call or text won&#8217;t change things. A real, physical letter is different and means a lot more. But remember, it&#8217;s just the first step in the <a href="http://howtogetexbacktips.com/making-up.php"> overall plan </a>to get them back!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>These are some great tips, but you will need a more detailed action plan if you want to get your ex boyfriend back. At <a href="http://howtogetexbacktips.com/making-up.php">how to win your ex boyfriend back</a>, not only will you be able to get your ex back, you also will be much better equipped to KEEP THEM long, long into the future.</b> </p>
<p>Get Your Ex Boyfriend Back</p>
<p>It is not easy to get your ex boyfriend back after a breakup. However, there are a few tips that you can follow to have him back again. So many people dont succeed in winning their ex back.  It&#8217;s not really our fault.  No one ever handed us an instruction book when we first started dating that taught us how to handle a breakup.  Much less, how to get someone back after a breakup. If you want to get your ex boyfriend back then  these 5 simple steps should help achieve your goal:</p>
<p>1.The first tip which will help you to get your ex boyfriend back is to get your head straight.  You need to get rid of the negative thoughts.  You have to stop feeling sorry for yourself.  You have to be willing to be strong.  </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t let your emotion and especially depression keep you down.  You can&#8217;t achieve a goal, if you can&#8217;t keep your emotions in check and your mind clear.  Negative thoughts are destructive behavior.  </p>
<p>2.Accept that the relationship in its prior form is over.  All the wishing in the world isn&#8217;t going to allow you to go back in time and change the way things happened.  You can&#8217;t let your mind keep wandering into the past.  </p>
<p>Focus on what is going on now.  If you realize that the relationship of the past wasn&#8217;t perfect you&#8217;re heading in the right direction and laying the foundation for you and your ex boyfriend to get back.  Remember you are most likely glossing over all the bad stuff that happened.  Think about this; the relationship didn&#8217;t get broke in a day.  Don&#8217;t expect to be able to fix it in a day either.</p>
<p>3.Don&#8217;t pester your ex boyfriend.  Guys just don&#8217;t like it when girls become obsessive about them.  Especially ex boyfriends.  You may want to seek comfort by hearing his voice or seeing his face, but if you really want him back, you must back off for a while.  Don&#8217;t continuously call him, text message him, email him, or go to his place or where he hangs out just to see him.  Give him time to realize he may have made a mistake.  He may begin to actually miss you.  If you blow it, you may have a tougher time getting him back. </p>
<p>4.Become an object of desire. If you can, get some new makeup.  Get some new clothes. Get a new hairstyle.  If you&#8217;ve picked up a few pounds, start exercising and eating healthy.  When you look good on the outside, you&#8217;re going to start feeling better about yourself on the inside.  By feeling good on the inside you will be confident and happy.  When you&#8217;re confident and happy, you will project this image to others.  You will become an object of desire to men.  This includes your ex boyfriend. </p>
<p>5.Take it slow.  If you followed steps 1-4 your ex boyfriend at some point will probably get in touch with you.  Imagine his surprise when he sees the new you from step 4.  He will probably be sorry that he broke up with you.  Keep your physical contact with him to a minimum, if you do see him.  </p>
<p>Seeing you looking your best and seeing that you&#8217;ve become confident and happy will make him desire you.  If you limit your physical contact with him, this will drive him crazy.  It will probably help to ensure that you don&#8217;t just jump back into a relationship only to breakup a short time later. </p>
<p>These tips may not be easy for you to do at first.  You may want to give in and call him or see him, but you have to resist the temptation.  These tips will help you to get your ex boyfriend back after a breakup.</p>

<p>Boyfriend Break Up &#8211; Is It Possible to Get Ex Back</p>
<p>Did your boyfriend break up with you?  This is a rough time in your life.  You are probably hurting and want to know what caused your boyfriend break up.  </p>
<p>First of all, while you can use this time to look at yourself and where you are in your life, dont do too much introspection.  The truth behind why your boyfriend broke up with you is that he had his own issues.  You know what they say, its not you, its me.</p>
<p>You can spend time trying to get your ex back.  If you are going to go down this route, you need to know the following things:</p>
<p>Dont pester your ex.  When your boyfriend broke up with you, it meant that you have more limited access to him. He probably neded a break. So dont text him multiple times a day or call him a lot.  </p>
<p>Its okay to flirt with other guys in his presence.  It may even make him want you back more.</p>
<p>When you do get back together for a trial date be cheerful and friendly but dont pressure him for more than he can handle.</p>
<p>But, if you have a feeling in your gut that the relationship is over when your boyfriend broke up with you, then you need to start moving on.  </p>
<p>One of the first things you can do after your boyfriend break up is to sit down and write a long letter to him pouring out your heart.  You can talk about the good times and bad.  You can tell him what a jerk he is and call him all sorts of names.  But, dont mail the letter!  Instead, take a candle out and burn it.  This is one of the best ways to get closure after a boyfriend break up.</p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is do a property exchange.  Give him back the t-shirt that you love to sleep in.  Get the econ textbook you lent him.  If there are things like toothbrushes that are too trivial to exchange, throw them away.  Dont have anything around that reminds you of him.  If you have gifts that he gave you, box them up for the time being.  If you have any money issues to resolve like debts to the other or a joint checking account, get them sorted out.</p>
<p>After you have completed the property exchange, agree that you wont have any communication for 30 days.  This may be hard if you are used to seeing each other on a daily basis, but after a boyfriend break up it is necessary to give yourself some space and distance.  </p>
<p>It hurts a lot when a boyfriend breaks up with you.  But it isnt the end of your life.  You can even look at it as a good thing because it means that you are now free to meet your true soul mate.</p>
<p>Of course, you shouldnt jump to the conclusion that just because youve gone through a boyfriend break up that all of the doors are firmly shut.  If you think you have a shot of winning him back and thats something you want, you should by all means take the opportunity to do so.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Are you looking for some useful break up tips?  There is some good advice here. But what do you do if you really want to get your relationship back? What are the best moves? There is actually a step by step plan at <a href="http://howtogetexbacktips.com/making-up.php">How To Get Your Ex Back</a> which helps you cope with the intial break up feelings, to how to approach your ex, right down to how to get them back and keep them for good. It also gives you ways to move on if the relationship is really over.</b></p>
<p>Break Up Tips</p>
<p>Break ups hurt, a lot. Finding that you are hurting and feeling intense emotions after a break up does not make you strange, it makes you human. We all experience some form of break up related pain during our lifetimes. It is important to know how to effectively deal with this pain in order to move on and get over the break up. The following tips may prove useful in getting over a break up.</p>
<p>Firstly, it is important to remember that no one is to blame for the break up. It is not your ex partners fault and it is not your fault; so there is no point in saying your what ifs or pointing the finger of blame. This will only result in the development of feelings of resentment within yourself, your ex partner or both and will ultimately serve to ruin any chances of maintaining a friendship. Instead, acknowledge the fact that a break up indicates that there was something wrong with the relationship and that remaining in the relationship would ultimately have been cheating you and your partner from finding relationships that provide you with everything you need.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is important to acknowledge and feel the emotions that come with a break up. Breaking up creates a barrage of intense emotions that many people try to deny. Denying such feelings will only result in you wallowing in your own pity for months on end. For this reason you must allow yourself the time and space to feel and express these emotions in a healthy way. Remember, it is ok to cry, in fact crying is one of the best means of getting it all out and letting go.</p>
<p>You may feel angry about the end of your relationship. This is common in most people. DO not take your anger out on other people or on your ex partner (remember a break up is no ones fault, therefore no one can be held accountable). Scream into a pillow or talk about your emotions with a friend. By no means should you do something to hurt your ex partner, even if you feel they have done something to deserve it. Acting in such a way will only make you appear small and petty to others, and will only make you feel worse in the long run. In order to let go of the feelings of anger, you must accept that the relationship has ended and there is nothing you could have done to prevent it from ending.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to remember that there is always hope. A break up does not mean you are doomed to be alone. There is someone out there for you and you will find them. Reminding yourself of this will make the process of letting go of the relationship much easier.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b> Here is a brief outline of the various stages of a plan to get your ex boyfriend back. To get the in depth details of a method that has been proven to work for thousands of others just like you, visit <a href="http://howtogetexbacktips.com/making-up.php">How To Get Your Man Back</a>. </b></p>
<p>How To Get Your Ex Boyfriend Back</p>
<p>There are a variety of reasons men may leave a relationship. These reasons may include feeling claustrophobic due to an emotionally clingy woman, or being over the relationship in general and feeling as though they need some single time.</p>
<p>In order to get your ex boyfriend back, you must be willing to take responsibility for the things in the relationship that you may be able to change for the better.</p>
<p>After a break up it is important to allow your ex boyfriend sufficient space in order to come to terms with what has happened. After you feel an appropriate amount of time has passed, begin by casually contacting him.</p>
<p>Slowly build up this contact until you feel confident enough to invite him on an outing.</p>
<p>Select the type of outing carefully, it should be something that the two of you used to enjoy as a couple. This will serve to remind him of how good the relationship could be and will also show him what he is missing out on.</p>
<p>Slowly increase the frequency of such outings and during your time together be sure to show him how hard you have tried to change anything that may have caused problems in your former relationship.</p>
<p>Remember to act attentive, yet casual. Refrain from asking him about his feelings or about the end of the relationship, as this will only serve to frustrate him and increase any feelings of claustrophobia he may have had. Instead, focus on the present and ensure the time you spend together is happy and carefree. Give him a reason to enjoy spending time with you.</p>
<p>If you previously let yourself go in the relationship, be sure to make the effort to get back into shape. All men appreciate a good body, and this will have the added benefit of gaining you the attention of other males. Whilst you should not act on this attention, it will appeal to your ex boyfriends protective side, and he will not like seeing other men giving you attention.</p>
<p>After sufficient time has elapsed, one of you may point out that it might be worth trying the relationship again. Your ex boyfriend should be more than happy with this decision, having seen the changes that you have made that will benefit the relationship.</p>
<p>Depending on the person, a talk may not be necessary, instead you may find that you have simply re-entered a relationship without either party being required to talk about it. Each situation will vary so it is up to you to decide the course of action you will take.</p>
