      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was going to write a post about continuing to ask questions until you get the answer you need in relation to business. However I decided that I could better relate this to my personal interactions and the recovery of my husband from a near fatal accident not dissimilar to the circumstances of <strong>Ian &#8220;Molly&#8221; Meldrum</strong> (music guru) and his family.</p>
<p>When a catastrophic incident occurs and it involves a loved one it is the family who has to take control and think and act on behalf of the injured party. My husband and Molly are similar in age, probable health and fitness, love music, and both were involved in near fatal accidents which has left them with severe brain injuries. </p>
<p>Just this week we heard that Molly has been moved to a private rehabilitation centre where he will hopefully kick start his recovery. This is where the family and friends really need to come to the fore and follow the 10 rules about asking questions until they get the answer they want.</p>
<p>The rules are about as straightforward as you can get:</p>
<p>Rule No. 1:   Ask.<br />
Rule No. 2:   Ask again.<br />
Rule No. 3:   Ask again.<br />
Rule No. 4:   Ask again.<br />
Rule No. 5:   Ask again.<br />
Rule No. 6:   Ask again.<br />
Rule No. 7:   Ask again.<br />
Rule No. 8:   Ask again.<br />
Rule No. 9:   Ask again.<br />
Rule No. 10: Ask again.</p>
<p>Many people will tell you this will happen or that will happen, there is just so much information to absorb but it is so important to keep asking questions. You&#8217;d be amazed at what can be achieved simply by taking the trouble to ask . . . and keep right on asking . . . until you get the &#8220;yes&#8221; you are after.</p>
<p>My husband was in Post Traumatic Amnesia (PTA) for 6 weeks and at the end of that 6th week he came home and private therapists came to him. I would not have known about private in home therapy if I had not asked questions, would not have known that putting him back in his home environment would make such a difference if I had not asked questions.</p>
<p>My thoughts are with Molly and his family as the possibly long journey to recovery starts. The standard stock answer for recovery is 24 months and I understand this because brain injuries are an unknown. However everyone is different and injuries can cause different reactions and recoveries can be different but I truly believe that by asking questions until you get the answers you want, will definitely make a difference to that recovery time frame. And in addition, it helps having a stubborn and determined &#8216;patient&#8217;.</p>
<p>Stubborn and determined I am sure Molly will be, just like my husband. I hope that with all the great help, love and support Molly will receive that he, like my husband will be back enjoying life a lot sooner than thought possible and then, he will be the one asking questions until he gets the answers he wants.</p>
<p>Footnote:</p>
<p>I have included a photo of my husband taken 71/2 months after the accident. He was given the all clear to travel so we did! And, as I write this he is at his piano playing and enjoying the music he has always loved. <div id="attachment_607" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.experienceseekerstravelclub.com/wp-uploads/2012/01/S7301181.jpg"><img src="http://www.experienceseekerstravelclub.com/wp-uploads/2012/01/S7301181-300x225.jpg" alt="" title="Cruising Through Life" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-607" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Life Is Wonderful Cruising</p></div></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <strong>purpose driven life</strong> or having a life purpose some may say are one and the same. Whether you agree or disagree with the statement, &#8216;purpose&#8217; is the word that matters.</p>
<p>Trundling through life without a purpose is a bit like treading water. You can stay afloat for ever and ever but you never really get anywhere. It is important that everyone reaches out and makes an effort to find their <em>life purpose</em> and be the the very best that they can be. Don&#8217;t be run of the mill or wishy washy about being something greater than just yourself.</p>
<p>A great quote from the wonderful Mr Zig Ziglar &#8221; You will never succeed as a wandering generality, you must become a meaningful specific.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href='http://youtu.be/VSrAJsWvEIc' >Life Purpose Found?</a></p>
<p>So how do you find your purpose of life? There are I think a few things which may help.</p>
<p>Listen To Your Heart</p>
<p>Day in, day out, these days especially we are in information overload. Buy this, do that, no don&#8217;t do that, go here, go there&#8230;..it is never ending! So stop, block out all the &#8216;noise&#8217; and listen to your heart as it is here that you will find your true purpose of life. Self talk to the one person who will listen and sometimes argue and disagree &#8211; yourself!</p>
<p>Write It Down</p>
<p>Do you keep a journal? I do. It has anything and everything in it, my life&#8217;s work if you like. You can become a &#8216;self&#8217; published author (of your own work). Your journal is the place to write those million things that float around in your head, (annoyingly at times). There you are at 2am in the morning with a million ideas zooming around &#8211; write them in your journal.<br />
Also ask yourself some questions like &#8220;How would I like people to remember me?&#8221; &#8220;What am I going to put on my bucket list &#8211; the most important things I want to do before I die?&#8221;<br />
Writing down the answers will give you a very good insight into you and the more times you ask and answer question the clearer your life purpose will become.</p>
<p>Track It Down With Purpose</p>
<p>There is no point sitting around waiting for information to fall into your lap, you have to become a seeker of that information. Start feeding your brain so that you can find out everything you can about what you desire and what you need to create your life&#8217;s purpose. The old addage &#8216;if you want to be a millionaire, surround yourself with millionaires&#8217;. Whatever you have thought of doing someone else has either done it already or done something very similar, so become the most avid of reader you can be and become a sponge. Combine this with your journal writing and your meetings with yourself and it won&#8217;t be long before you discover your <strong>purpose of life</strong>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To help get the most out of yourself and become a better leader start with what you can do for yourself. Learn to take control of bad habits and turn them into good habits. If you can accumulate an abundance of good habits then you will be a better person, a better manager and ultimately a better leader.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Worry about Being the Best</strong></p>
<p>Believe it or not, you just have to be better than the people around you. Instead of trying to be the absolute best, strive to be the best that you can be at whatever the task may be. It&#8217;s the experience of trying that really counts. </p>
<p> <strong>Make sure You Are The One Making The Choices</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re unsure about your choices, make the best possible choice given the information you have in front of you. Whether the decision is right or wrong, making your own decision will still be better than letting someone else make the decision for you. It&#8217;s part of the process of learning. </p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Wait for Someone Else to Teach You</strong></p>
<p>No matter what the task, if you teach it to yourself, you&#8217;ll learn it better. This might require a bit of research on your part; you may need to end up asking a bunch of questions. Just keep in mind that the only &#8220;stupid&#8221; question is the one that you don&#8217;t ask. </p>
<p>Then the next thing that you have to do is to share the knowledge. Pass it along. Learn to be a mentor so that the next person gains the knowledge. </p>
<p><strong>Always Follow Your Dreams</strong></p>
<p>Every dreamer pays a price, but so does everyone who fears to dream. The price for not dreaming or ignoring dreams is much higher. Every now and then, sit down and let yourself imagine. There is nothing to lose and everything to gain. Let go and put no limits on yourself it is amazing what you can do. </p>
<p><strong>Always Look For An Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>We pass opportunities by every day. Be vigilant and take note of where you can help someone else. Always ask yourself the question &#8220;What can I offer that will be of benefit to that person or situation?&#8221;. Providing a solution to others&#8217; problems can become a huge opportunity for you.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Sell Yourself Short – Ever</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t doubt your abilities, and don&#8217;t doubt your talents. Forget about what you&#8217;ve been led to believe by the media or people in your life. Recognize your strengths, and listen to your inner voice. Eliminate &#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8221; from your vocabulary. </p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t Accept or Expect Mediocrity</strong></p>
<p>Expect excellence of both yourself and of others. The minute you expect less of yourself is the same minute that your inner self will get the compromised message and start delivering less. Always push yourself to be the best you possibly can be. </p>

<p>I recently read where scientist&#8217;s discovered one tiny atom&#8217;s behavior replicates the entire universe!</p>
<p>Each atom – there are billions upon billions of them – creates alternative universes, time lines, and parallel realities where duplicates of you and me and everyone else are living simultaneous, yet different lives. And that&#8217;s the keyword &#8211; “different” lives!</p>
<p>This explains why some people are successful and some are not. Some are rich or poor. Why some enjoy health and some are sick. Why some have great relationships, etc.</p>
<p>Well, you get the picture. Apparently, where we place our focus has something (and<br />
everything) to do with it.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty amazing? Well, someone has discovered a way to jump the time lines into parallel realities &#8211; really!</p>
<p>Look at this at <a href="http://www.selflearningclub.com/info/thesourxe.htm">TheSourxe</a>.  </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Your blog has the potential to be a money making magnet, if you know the right steps to take. Blogs once started as a sort of online diary. They’ve been totally transformed to fit a whole range of needs, from a place to house an online newspaper to a simple way to start an Internet stream of income. The following five methods will help show you <strong><a href="http://www.selflearningclub.com/info/blogbank.htm">ways to make money fast</a></strong> from your blog, no matter what niche you are in and how you are using your blog.</p>
<p><strong>1.	Affiliate marketing</strong></p>
<p>This  is one of the easiest ways to make money from your blog, and the simplest to start. You begin by selecting an affiliate program from one of the popular affiliate networks. You can either post a review on your blog about the product (complete with your affiliate link) or post ads along the side of your posts (also with your affiliate link). Affiliate marketing is simple to implement because you don’t have to worry about writing a product.</p>
<p><strong>2.	Selling your own product</strong></p>
<p>If you feel there is a need to be met in your niche and want to create your own product, you can add it to your blog for another stream of income. Advertising your own product on your blog is a  smart idea. Your readers have already built a level of trust with you so they’ll be likely to be interested in your product. You can link to your product’s sales page directly from your posts and display graphic ads in the sidebars of your blog.</p>
<p><strong>3.	Contextual advertising</strong></p>
<p>Contextual advertising, like the type offered at Text Links, will help you <em>make money blogging</em> without much intervention on your part. When you sign up with Text Links or a similar service, your blog posts will automatically have certain words hyperlinked. These links go to advertiser’s websites. You get paid when someone clicks on a link. Unlike with affiliate programs, you don’t get a commission on the sale but you do get paid whether or not your visitor buys from the advertiser’s site.</p>
<p><strong>4.	Other types of advertising</strong></p>
<p>Google Adsense and other pay per click advertising programs will give you code to add to your website. These programs will display ads in the sidebars of your website. Anytime a visitor clicks on one of these links, you will get paid anywhere from a few cents to a few dollars depending on your niche. These ads don’t appear within the body of your post, but they are based on the content of your posts so they will be attractive to your audience.</p>
<p><strong>5.	Get paid for reviews</strong></p>
<p>Once you have some traffic coming to your blog, you can be paid to post reviews. There are many different networks that link advertisers with bloggers.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Amazing True Story That Gave Us Think And Grow Rich And How You Can Get Your Own Free Copy!</p>
<p>On a dark and stormy night in 1908, a young man was invited to the mansion of America&#8217;s first billionaire, Andrew Carnegie.  In front of a flickering fire, <strong><a href="http://www.FreeTGRbook.com/SelfLearningClub">Napoleon Hill</a></strong>, a young, ambitious reporter quizzed Carnegie about his principles of success. </p>
<p>The crusty Carnegie was impressed by the earnest young fellow and suddenly offered him a shocking proposition: &#8220;Mr. Hill, on your behalf I will use my considerable influence to arrange opportunities for you to personally spend time with 500 of the greatest accomplishers of our time. They will include fellow industrialists, entrepreneurs, inventors, merchants, statesmen, artists, and many others. You will have as much time as you need to interview, learn from and observe them. Your objective will be to validate the belief success is a matter of an ideology, of universal laws, which can be enumerated, learned and then simply duplicated and used as skills to deliver predictable results, just as you might learn the laws and process of making steel.</p>
<p>You will accomplish this mission by documenting the beliefs and behaviors all these great men and women share in common. No remuneration shall be paid to you by myself. You must support yourself while working on this project.</p>
<p>Your goal will be the publication of a &#8216;success encyclopedia&#8217; enumerating the laws. Whatever the financial rewards arise from that are yours. You have just 60 seconds to accept or reject this offer…&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Napoleon Hill</strong> said yes, with a second to spare.  And more than a hundred years later more than 20 million people have learned the principles of success because of his decision. </p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s your turn to make a decision to own this incredible road map to wealth and achievement.  Go ahead&#8230;<a href="http://www.FreeTGRbook.com/SelfLearningClub">get your free copy today</a> so you can begin to Think and Grow Rich.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is obvious that having a fantastic business <strong><a href="http://www.selflearningclub.com/info/sws.htm">sale letter</a></strong> can make or break a product or service. You can sell a extraordinary product or service to a tightly targeted market, and if the copy is limited, the final results will not be up to scratch.</p>
<p>One of the issues with writing content stems from being too close to a task. If it is your product or service, sometimes it is hard to take a step back and understand that the  reasons you&#8217;re keen on it may not always translate to another person. It is a lot like having children. What is lovable or wonderful about your kid to you might be odd or aggravating to another person. Now perhaps should they get to know your son or daughter, they would find them adorable, as well. That is the purpose of the instant sales letter.</p>
<p>Your own product or service is your “baby” currently. You are without a doubt in love with it. You need to step back and try to consider exactly what might make you shell out your money on it if it was not yours.</p>
<p>So how do you get it done? How do you compose a terrific sales letter? I am pleased you inquired…</p>
<p>1.Grab Interest: You have to get the reader’s attention immediately. The pre-head, and then a main headline ought to grab hold of your reader to make all of them wish to know more. If possible, you want to give the ultimate reward for the product in the headline. If it is easy, requires almost no time or effort, and/or features a large payoff, your reader needs to be absolutely hooked with all the possible results straight away.</p>
<p>- What is the ultimate “best reason” somebody ought to purchase your product or service?</p>
<p>- What is the most attractive consequence of purchasing the product for the reader?</p>
<p>- What, over anything else, will be most beneficial about buying it?</p>
<p>This is your chance to quickly encapsulate your whole sales letter in one, eye-catching sentence that&#8217;s sure to be read by the person visiting your website.</p>
<p>2.Point out the issue: People need to learn the reason why they require your product. Exactly what dilemma will you be clearing up? Which are the aggravations that you can alleviate using your product, handbook, report? Many times, there are multiple problems that can be outlined so make sure you deal with every perspective possible.</p>
<p>I typically choose to utilize the “3 Reasons Why”, or “5 Problems With” approach. Generate a list of difficulties or concerns that you know your target audience deals with, and next explain a couple of details about these types of issues. Make sure they feel personal.</p>
<p>3.Introduce the Product or service: Provide details about the product or service, what&#8217;s going to be included, and why it’s a remedy to what your prospective customers are looking for. You will want to list solutions in immediate response to the issues referred to above. Boast about yourself a little, but do it in a humble way. If you are the pro, be the pro. Tell them why your product can easily answer their issues, fix their particular issues.</p>
<p>4.Provide Lots of Particulars: Folks desire meat, not tofu. You MUST present the meat of what your potential customers are going to be getting once they part with their money. Bullet lists, subject or chapter heads, samples of genuine content material. The better the content material distributed here, the more people are fully aware what they will get with the product or service, the more valuable it&#8217;ll be in their mind. For those who have evidence, testimonials, etc…this is excellent information regarding the product as well, if employed sparingly and properly.</p>
<p>5.Call to Action: In marketing, this is the close. You need to give the audience a good reason to act. Ask them to purchase, set a limit, or even provide a bonus for fast action. Give a satisfaction assurance, as well. Get them to feel at once compelled to purchase, in addition to being comfortable with purchasing.</p>
<p>There are a lot of methods to put great <strong><a href="http://www.selflearningclub.com/info/sws.htm">sales letter templates</a></strong> together. Make use of the tools you have, and your very own experience, to promote your baby. Ensure you include these 5 steps, and you will be on your journey to sales copy that actually sells.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This particular <strong><a href="http://www.selflearningclub.com/info/mindmovies.htm">Mind Movies</a></strong> Overview will give you a very clear picture of just what you will be spending money on if you obtain a membership to mind movies, or perhaps decide to use a number of the free versions available on Youtube. But before we get into this Mind Movies Overview, you may be curious about knowing a little in regards to the principle which is guiding Mind Movies: the law of attraction. Through the use of mind movies you can actually alter your subconscious programming so that you come to be &#8220;tuned in&#8221; to what you would like. It is the ideal remedy for the lazy individual who desires to use the law of attraction without having to perform any additional work of meditating or visualizing.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s read some more of the Mind Movies Review so that you can determine whether using mind movies will be really worth your money and time.</p>
<p>Exactly what You can expect From Using Mind Movies?</p>
<p><em>Mind movies</em> use visual simulation as well as subliminal messages to program your subconscious. These types of messages impact ones thinking and decisions so you become trained for success, whether financial success, better health or even attracting the love that you have always wanted. Yet, can this kind of method actually work?</p>
<p>Well, if you are wondering about it, it might interest you to find out that marketers once used these types of subliminal messages during movies to get people to purchase food like popcorn, candy and sodas. In addition to this, TV commercials also used subliminal messaging to condition an individual&#8217;s subconscious mind so that they would be more likely to purchase merchandise. But the use of visual subliminal messaging proved to be so powerful that it is not permitted to be used by marketers any more.</p>
<p>Obviously, marketing and advertising specialists are finding ways around this. The fact subliminal messages are considered to have this kind of effect must tell you precisely how potent they could be if you decide to begin to use mind movies to recondition yourself for success. The good thing is there&#8217;s not necessarily any artwork or discipline involved, you merely start the mind movies and permit them to do their work&#8230;.which in itself is actually a pretty significant bonus.</p>
<p>A Little Caution</p>
<p>Let me tell you exactly what I think the possible problem might be from using mind movies too much. Crucial thinking and awareness is essential to making practical plans of action and to enable you to influence your actions in accordance with your subconscious programming. Certainly, using something like mind movies is actually teaching you what you should think. However they do not automatically assist you to discover ways to believe &#8211; which is a major factor for succeeding at something.</p>
<p>I suggest that along with making use of mind movies to get the Law of attraction helping you, that you simply devote some time to writing or to alternative activities that may keep creative and critical thinking capabilities sharpened. Without this, you might be merely programming values straight into your brain while not building the individuality needed to in fact turn these beliefs directly into strong outcomes.</p>
<p>I suggest making the investment in mind movies for any one of the following reasons: If you&#8217;re thinking about making use of the law of attraction but you believe that the aid of visual stimulation might support it to occur more quickly. Second, if you have in mind using them in the periods when you are usually having difficulty centering your thoughts through normal meditation or self hypnosis.</p>
<p>When you invest in utilizing <strong><a href="http://www.selflearningclub.com/info/mindmovies.htm">mind movies</a></strong> for these two reasons and possess a strong wish to improve your everyday living, I really believe that you will be totally satisfied with your investment.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.selflearningclub.com/info/isagenix.htm">Multi level marketing companies</a>&#8216; concepts are too darn simple – you build a network of people and jointly you promote a product or service. At the same time you try to bring more people into the network. For each person that joins the network the upline members earn a commission. Direct sales bring in the money too, but the main income is brought in through the commissions that the network building generates.</p>
<p>Building the network can be formidable for some people. Even so, there are plenty of sources of help so that you can build a solid network. You receive a website from the network marketing company that you join, you can attend physical seminars and webinars and you have access to a host of material, online and offline, where you can learn how to promote your network to the hilt.</p>
<p>You need to remember one thing – joining the <a href="http://www.selflearningclub.com/info/isagenix">multi level marketing companies</a>&#8216; opportunity could be a life-changing experience. You might begin seeing everything in a totally new light. But that’s also the way you can earn that six figure income.</p>
<p>The most popular <strong>multi level marketing companies</strong> around the world promote themselves on a global level. Joining carries the great benefit of prevailing goodwill that you can use to build your business. Also, these companies have their own training and orientation programs which you can access no matter where you live which can help you start out on the right foot.</p>
<p>Robert Kiyosaki, best known for his series of books &#8220;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&#8221; is a proponent of multi level marketing companies and said &#8220;Why not build a network marketing business in your spare time? Why not build something you control and you own?&#8221; &#8220;The reason I recommend network marketing is because network marketing is the business of the future&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also says the two essential reasons to join a network marketing business is, one to help yourself and two, to help others. If you join for only one of these two reasons, then the system will not work for you.</p>
<p>One company that epitomises the help others and help yourself philosophy is Isagenix. Isagenix is part of the health and wellness industry and manufactures and markets products for nutritional cleansing.</p>
<p>Isagenix is a company that embraces the help others/help yourself philosophy. Everyone starts out as a consumer of the products and because of the wonderful benefits gained from using the product people then move on to begin their own business. They have the results from using the Isagenix nutritional cleanse products to show others(reason 1),who in turn become advocates and show others the benefits gained and so on. Meanwhile you are healthy and on your way to wealthy as your <em>multilevel network marketing</em> business is growing(reason 2). </p>
<p>The Isagenix <strong>multi level network marketing</strong> business opportunity suits most people looking to start their own business &#8211; either as an add on income stream to an established business or as something for the person looking to escape the 9-5 and operate a business from home. </p>
