      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>It is a good idea to insulate one&#8217;s cellar to bring the energy costs down and to create an extra living space. Un-insulated, the warm air located above soil level mingles with the cooler air below ground level and causes moisture to collect in the wood framing and insulation. The result is a growth of spores which causes rot as well as unhealthy air. There are several basement insulation methods available and the home owner should learn what the best option is for their home.</p>
<p>Some basements are not very appealing to visit. Patience is needed to go downstairs and note the pluses and minuses of the situation.Choosing to go down when the climate outdoors is comfortable will make the lower level more inviting to explore.</p>
<p>There are three types of basement insulation. Rigid foam, polyurethane spray and blanket are the main choices. Not every cellar is suitable for all these insulating walls so one must first make an assessment of their cellar to decide which system is best. Once the homework is done the home owner can decide if they want to do the project themselves or contract it out.</p>
<p>Experience has shown that when a basement is insulated it does not take very long to recuperate the investment. The energy savings are significant throughout the house.</p>
<p>If the walls are straight then the best system is the rigid foam with the highest RSI value. It also requires the least amount of space. The exterior walls will have two inches of foam attached to them and the floor will only require one inch. Each piece fits together closely and a special adhesive glue is used to attach the panels onto the surfaces. The seams between the panels must be taped and sprayed with foam. Nailing strips provide an alternative solution to the gluing system. Studs are attached to the foam and a moisture resistant 12.7 millimeters of drywall is added to the studs.</p>
<p>There are two ways to build the new wall. It can be built flush using 2&#215;4 inch lumber or it can be extended from the original wall by two inches. This creates an additional ventilation space that reduces moisture.</p>
<p>Spray foam is the best solution for irregular walls. It is also recommended for walls with moisture issues. The product must be applied by a certified specialist. The foam must be distributed evenly and covered by a layer of fire-resistant material. The foam tends to expand so it must be sprayed in moderation.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.greenhealthyhome.com">Green Homes</a></p>
<p><small>Any windows in the walls need to be insulated with spray polyurethane foam around the frames. Water pipes should be wrapped in their own insulating material and moved away from the wall insulation. <a href="http://www.refiticf.com/" target="_blank">Insulating Basement</a> methods apply to windows also. Most of the outdoor heat and cool air comes in through the windows. The windows should be replaced with insulated windows that will greatly cut down on energy costs.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Technology to take full advantage of the power of geothermal energy is actually an area that really needs to be explored. Geothermal energy is an area that has great opportunity but has really been underutilized. Our earth produces a tremendous amount of energy that has never been taken advantage of. As individuals walk around every day, they probably are totally unaware of the massive amount of power that lies beneath their feet. All we have to do is discover a way to take advantage of that energy for ourselves. The scorching heat at the center of the planet is 60 times hotter than that of hot boiling water. There is certainly a lot of energy merely a few miles below the Earth&#8217;s surface that have been created from the high temperature generated from the Earth&#8217;s core.</p>
<p>With obtaining simple and easy accessibility to info on several <b>ways to going green</b> matters, there may be just no pretext for not exploring tips on how to make a difference in the world right now. If you have at any time watched what takes place when a volcano erupts, you will understand that there is much power as well as energy in the magma, or superheated fluids. Much of the fluids arrive through as heavy steam through the natural air vents. To be able to create their own vents, and containment chambers for the magma, people may have energy converted into electrical energy to power their homes. To create a large scale geothermal plant, they would need to dig a well at an area that has large quantities of magma. The set up would most likely allow the steam to be moved through pipes to deliver energy. Enough of the steam would produce electrical power, by turning a turbine generator.</p>
<p>There are many issues that some men and women have about using geothermal energy on a large scale. There are some people today who think that it is too high priced to do more research and too time-consuming to find the right spot. In addition, the cost to produce a plant is high with no guarantee that it could make money. Once the areas are set up, they might not produce enough steam to be worthwhile. Additionally, some environmentalists are concerned that a geo-thermal plant may force up increased pollutants into the air.</p>
<p>But the advantages to using geothermal energy significantly outweighs the criticisms. More analysis will probably show that any health concerns with geothermal has to be minimal since it is coming up naturally from the Earth. Once a geothermal plant is made, managing the energy is not really that difficult making it a very efficient energy resource. The natural environment would be disrupted less, mainly because the plants are smaller than giant dams, atomic energy, or electrical facilities. As an alternative form of energy, the dependence on coal or petroleum would diminish.</p>
<p>One thing about geothermal energy is that it will for no reason run out, and it will not continuously be rising in price. Once the preliminary cost to build the infrastructure is paid back, geothermal will be a cheap energy resource. In the end this is a resource that we will come to depend upon.</p>
<p><small>When was the last time you truly prevailed at <a target='_blank' href="http://waystogoinggreen.net">ways to going green now</a>? It is true that men and women can fail so many times they basically get used to it. You are able to ease into something unique as <a target='_blank' href="http://waystogoinggreen.net/ways-to-going-green/">ways to going green</a> will describe very easily.</small></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Hydronic radiant floors </p>
<p>Are you aware of the fact that as much as 35% to 45% of residential energy bills go to heating/cooling? Radiant floor designs can save 40% of your heating costs while keeping the house comfortable. It also comes with &#8216;no-noise &#8216; guarantee since heat is broadcast over the floor (it does not make use of mechanical parts like fans or blowers). It can go under the present floor between the rafters or under most finish materials. Radiant floors are a great option during your next home remodeling project.</p>
<p>The choices for the flooring material are nearly infinite; you can use carpet, hardwood, linoleum and laminate, or you can pick &#8216;high-mass &#8216; substances like tile, marble or slate &#8212; all with good heat holding properties so that you can cut some more on your energy use. For important savings on your utility bills, you might need to consider thermal mass floor which are excellent heat holder; and if you want an eco-friendly solution, couple the radiant floor design to a solar thermal system &#8212; using the sun-heated water to run around your place through water pipes.</p>
<p>Hydronic radiant floors are designed so that lukewarm water runs underneath it thru plastic tubes. This system is made up of a water heater (boiler), a circulation pump, a thermostat and a manifold of valves to facilitate water circulation.</p>
<p>Installation of a hydronic system is usually handled by HVAC contractors or pro plumbers because of the floor area and difficulty concerned. This cost can range from US$6-US$12 per square foot &#8212; double or treble that for alternative heating systems.</p>
<p>But it offers amazing operational saving when runs on 1 full level (more savings can be achieved when used on the whole house). With such floor area, savings of roughly 33% is possible when put next to condition air.</p>
<p>Vinyl, tile and carpet are all acceptable for this system (they can go immediately on top of hydronic masonry floor) but some heat loss is inescapable if employed with materials that do not hold heat relatively well,eg carpet (not so great) vs tile (great). The plastic tubing can run under a wooden floor as well , by positioning itself just underneath the finished flooring or it can get tightened to the bottom of the subfloor, between beams. If you can reach the bottom of the floor, maybe you need to use this option as a part of your home improvement project.</p>
<p> <strong>Electrical Radiant Floors</strong> </p>
<p>Electrical radiant floor design makes use of miniscule heating wires, rather like those you find in an electrical blanket, to warm up the ceramic tiles on top. Due to these fine wires, the necessary flooring elevation is minimum; making it ideal for remodelling.</p>
<p>Usually radiant floor design is applied on kitchens, mudrooms and bathroom, where the touch of warm floor is so desirable. It incorporates its own temperature controls and it is never meant as a replacement to the central heating &#8212; instead the electrical radiant floor is intended to play a complimentary role to that central heating.</p>
<p>To add electric-driven radiant floor design to an existing space, a separate 15- to 20-amp GFCI-protected circuit (to power it), and a further tile floor are required. It would be an ideal fit for your remodelled home.</p>
<p>A bathroom-size retrofit will set you back US$400 to US$700 (new tile inclusive). The electricity consumed would be similar to that of 3 x 100W lightbulbs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Many people wonder how can double glazed windows reduce your energy consumption. After all, utilities form a large part of household expenses. This can be alleviated in several ways due to this revolutionary technology that is both smart and efficient.</p>
<p>Seasonal changes are always hard on whomever has to pay the bills. The reason for this is that in warm weather, it&#8217;s hard to keep heat out and in cold weather it&#8217;s just as hard to keep it in. And while the walls are generally heavily insulated, the glass that allows views from outside is not such a great insulator. In fact, it happens to be a pretty good conductor.</p>
<p>With this new technology, instead of a single pane, there are two with some sort of gas inserted between them. Most gases are excellent insulators because they do not transfer heat. This stops any heat from outside in the summer from coming in and any warmth from inside leaving during cooler weather.</p>
<p>In order to maximize the effectiveness of this multiple pane method, great lengths are gone to insure that there is a proper space in the middle. The reason for this is because if the gap is too large, the gases trapped inside will form convection currents which transfer the heat from one pane to the other. If they are too close together, than there will not be a proper insulation effect.</p>
<p>In order to certify that the appropriate distance is established, certain spacers are put in place. These can sometime be made out of metal, but unless it&#8217;s aluminum with a sufficiently high thermal barrier, such spacers can cause problems by conducting heat and also creating condensation between the panes. Otherwise, the spacers can be made from fairly non-conductive structural foam for better results.</p>
<p>All of these things contribute to a more insulated and power-efficient house. Because this particular method is so much better at insulating than conventional ones, an immediate drop in power consumptions will most surely be recognized.</p>
<p>An additional advantage to this particular method of smarter insulation is that is also protects against too much noise. The insulation serves not only to keep out the heat but also any ambient sounds that can often prove somewhat aggravating.</p>
<p>How can double glazed windows reduce your energy consumption is a simple matter to understand, and an economic one. Because of its unique construction and special properties, this type of barrier proves the most sound and efficient for the job.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>The news and certain television shows are where you&#8217;ve probably seen it. The way to go is keeping an environmentally friendly home. A lot of money can potentially be saved as well. Just how expensive it can sometimes be to purchase energy efficient products for your home, such as solar panels or appliances, is where the problem lies. You don&#8217;t have to break the bank to be environmentally friendly though. Certain products that do their part in helping preserve the environment can be purchased at low cost.</p>
<p>A prime example is paper products. There are other options, despite assumptions that paper products consist only of items you eat food off of. Why not make sure you&#8217;ve purchased recycled paper if you have to print off a lot of it for work or school projects? Tissues, napkins and, yes, even plates and other tableware products are all included in this list. You&#8217;ll be doing your part to keep your home eco-friendly as a result, and the cost is virtually the same as the non-recycled counterparts.</p>
<p>How about office supplies, in the same vein? It is possible to recycle many plastic and metal office products. Many people also have home offices today, even if you don&#8217;t have any say in what products your employer&#8217;s office uses. Why not ensure you&#8217;re only purchasing office supplies that have been recycled, then?</p>
<p>Did you know it was also possible to recycle glass as well, despite most peoples&#8217; belief that using paper products is the only cost-effective way to be environmentally friendly? Great examples of recycled glass products are drinking glasses and bottles, but there are more beyond that. Glass plates and dishes do exist. Plus, you can always request new windows be made from recycled glass, the next time you need to replace your home&#8217;s windows.</p>
<p>A variety of different shapes and sizes are consequently available in which to purchase recycled products. You as an American may most easily recognize paper products, but you can also look into other relatively inexpensive products made from recycled material. Helping the environment doesn&#8217;t have to cost you an arm and a leg. People just need to be able to spot office supplies, glass and other products as recyclable in order to make use of them. You just need to be cognizant and constantly on the look-out, and before you know it, you too can be purchasing products that are ready for a second (or even third) use.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Air conditioners have changed a lot over the years. Some models do a lot more than just cool the air. Figuring out the features of the various types and styles of air conditioners available on the market can be very difficult when you are looking to buy one.</p>
<p>There are a lot of decisions that should be made before buying an air conditioner. The most important is to make sure that the air conditioning unit that you purchase will be the appropriate size for the space that you are trying to cool. So, what are the features that you should look for when buying an air conditioning unit? Here are just a few that you might like to review before purchasing a unit.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Having an energy efficient air conditioning unit will lessen your cooling costs. The more energy efficient your air conditioner is the less your energy bill will be. It&#8217;s as simple as that. That is why when you evaluate each of the cooling devices you need to always remember although you may have to spend more on an energy efficient unit to begin with, it will save you money in the long run. By considering this factor you will also be doing your part to help the environment.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>With just about every air conditioning unit controlling humidity is a very important addition to cooling. The humidification capabilities of every model are different. Some units have separate humidification settings for those days that are more humid than hot. Even when you need both, controlling the cooling and humidification capabilities independently is always better.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>The capability to be able to switch an air conditioning on and off at different times can also be a factor that can provide you with convenience while at the same time save you money. Leaving your air conditioning unit running all day when you are no wastes energy and money. Have a programmable thermostat can allow you to be able to adjust the temperature when you are away or at home.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Air conditioning units come in different shapes and sizes. So you need to make sure that the unit you decide on will work best in your home. Do your research well in advance and you will be glad that you did.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>Poor air quality is often impossible to notice because contaminants are invisible. At other times, contaminated indoor air may have an odd smell. Poor indoor air quality can cause building occupants to become ill. Air quality annual periodic testing rates the cleanliness of the air. Duct maintenance is essential for good air quality.</p>
<p>Duct cleaning addresses many common indoor pollution issues. Around twenty-five percent of the Canadian population has allergic rhinitis according to the Canadian Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Foundation. Causes of indoor air pollution include contaminants from indoors and outdoors, building fabric contamination, and inadequate ventilation.</p>
<p>Several pollutants can collect inside ducts. Mold is the most common. It grows within ducts or on heating and cooling system parts. It may grow on insulation that surrounds ducts. Removing mold from ducts will help, but mold will recur if the cause of growth is never eradicated.</p>
<p>Ducts can also be clogged by other pollutants. They can become infested by rodents or vermin. They can be clogged with dirt and debris released into the home from supply registers. They may be clogged by pet hair or outdoor allergens.</p>
<p>Technicians clean more than just ductwork in a high-quality cleaning. They clean the HVAC components of forced air systems. These include fans, air handling units, and drip pans. These include coils, diffusers, and grilles. These include both supply and return air ducts.</p>
<p>Technicians use specialized tools to dislodge dirt and debris. They vacuum with a high-powered machine. They may apply chemical biocides to the insides of ducts. They may apply chemical biocide to other heating components. They might apply encapsulants that inhibit mold growth. They may apply sealants that prevent the release of dirt or fiber particles.</p>
<p>Good technicians have several characteristics. Many have certification from NATE (North American Technician Excellence) or NADCA (National Air Duct Cleaners Association). They provide good references and have clean records with the Better Business Bureau and local consumer affairs organizations. They carry appropriate licensure. They provide estimates that include a timetable if they charge by the hour. They inform homeowners of any possible interruptions in the work schedule.</p>
<p>Property owners should ask their technician some important questions. They might ask about their level of experience with a particular HVAC system. They might ask if they comply with NADCA standards. They might ask what steps they take to protect people, homes, and pets from contaminants released during cleaning.</p>
<p>Property owners should monitor technicians&#8217; work. Good technicians open all access ports to make sure the entire system is maintained. They alert homeowners to the presence of asbestos. Their vacuums are either HEPA machines, or their exhaust systems send pollutants outdoors. Technicians use soft-bristled brushes when cleaning fiberglass. They repair any holes in ducts or surrounding insulation. They take care of carpet and home furnishings.</p>
<p>Duct cleaning is a crucial part of air quality annual periodic testing. Good technicians adhere to established cleaning standards. Clean ducts prevent air contamination by mold and other allergens. They also prevent infestations by rodents or other vermin.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>One can find all kinds of recycling containers. You can find just about every material composing the containers built today. Organic materials such as wood, long-lasting materials like steel, and other materials should be chosen based on the specific use of the recycling bin. This is a guide to help you buy a container for all applications, whether it be for the office or at your home.</p>
<p>Average materials would be the metal and plastic containers. These have been around for quite some time, but they are also of the most common. Steel containers are best for large scale applications of recycling while plastic is common in the home environment. Plastic is sometimes seen as a poor choice because it doesn&#8217;t always degrade well.</p>
<p>Recycled materials are a popular fad for recycling containers. They may cost more because of the extra work in constructing them, but the recycling fanatics are more than willing to pay a higher fee for supporting the recycling cause at every level. Sometimes these recycled containers are made of recycled plastic &#8211; which isn&#8217;t very degradable but it does ensure that new plastic isn&#8217;t put into production and rather recycles current supplies.</p>
<p>Previously metal was a good choice for big recycling operations. This is being changed with the use of fiberglass. Fiberglass itself is very durable, resists fire, and can withstand the natural bumps and bruises that come with handling the containers. Fiberglass can indeed be put back into the recycling process if need be: fiberglass is needed in operations such as asphalt mixing and in some building materials.</p>
<p>Some recycling applications on a large scale don&#8217;t give much room in choice. An example would be with steel recycling bins, which are often the first choice when dealing with a large scale operation because of the durability of steel. This allows workers to load and unload bins easily by using other machines to do the dirty work. Materials such as plastic or wood would be susceptible to breakage or prone to accidents.</p>
<p>The low end of recycling is simple: use a bag you would get from your grocery store. Make sure it&#8217;s a degradable sack or one made of organic fiber. Using plastic bags is strongly discouraged since they are contributing to a nationwide problem in landfills. Some cities will even award vouchers to households that want to start recycling: check with your local government to see what they offer.</p>
<p>In Conclusion</p>
<p>The innovation in recycling container materials is still on the move. While we wait to see more mixtures and compounds of materials, it&#8217;s important that you find out what your opportunities are in helping the recycling movement.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<!-- Start Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><!-- End Shareaholic LikeButtonSetTop --><p>A great deal of electricity is wasted in the average household, leading to higher utility bills and concerns for the environment. By making some simple changes, it&#8217;s possible to significantly lower your consumption of electricity. Here are some recommended methods for saving electric at home.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t make your refrigerator work harder than necessary. Because the fridge has to run constantly, it tends to use more energy than any other appliance in your home. It will use less if it is not subjected to excessive kitchen heat. Locate it away from the oven and other sources of warmth such as radiators. Place it against a cooler outside wall and be sure it is not in direct sunlight.</p>
<p>Electric dryers make you pay a high price for convenience. You can reduce your electricity payments significantly by line drying your laundry. On rainy days, set up a drying rack indoors. Clothes will dry quickly in winter if you locate the rack near a heating vent or radiator.</p>
<p>Electronic devices in standby mode continue to drain electricity when you&#8217;re not even using them. Make the effort to unplug appliances such as a microwave you only use for a few minutes each day or a stereo you only use on weekends. If the plugs on things like your TV or computer are buried in hard to reach places, consider investing in an energy saving adapter socket kit. It will allow you to disconnect them from the electricity supply using a remote control.</p>
<p>Incandescent light bulbs waste energy by producing heat as well as light. Energy saving bulbs last over ten times longer and use up to four times less electricity. You can make significant savings by using energy efficient bulbs in all the ceiling lights in your home. If you prefer incandescent light for reading, use old style bulbs only in desk or table lamps.</p>
<p>There are many ways to save electricity when cooking on a stove. Use the right size burner for the pan. Put lids on pots to conserve heat and bring the contents to a boil faster. Cook a whole meal on one burner by using a tiered streamer. Measure out the amount of water you need for things like instant soup or noodles and don&#8217;t boil more than you require.</p>
<p>Where a microwave oven uses three units of energy to heat a frozen dinner, an electric oven uses up to sixteen. Only preheat your conventional oven for foods that are not recommended for microwave cooking. Most processed foods have microwave instructions and there are many recipes available for cooking traditional meals in the microwave.</p>
<p>Controlling your thermostat is vital for saving electric at home. Careless use of central heating can lead to a big increase in utility bills. Whenever the whole family is going to be out of the house for more than a couple of hours, turn the temperature down to around 55 F. If you&#8217;re only using one room for hours at a time, don&#8217;t heat the entire house. Turn down the thermostat, close the door and keep warm with a small space heater.</p>
