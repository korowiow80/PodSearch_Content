<p>You see, real hypnosis in not about mind control and brain washing, the real secret is that you can give your subconscious mind commands that it will obey and make positive changes in your life. The reason this works so well is because the subconscious does not have a critical faculty which means that it will believe any message that it hears enough.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can use hypnosis for positive change in your life and one of the first is self hypnosis.</p>
<p>This is great because you don’t have to spend a lot of money on a professional hypnotists and you can start to see some of the benefits right away.</p>
<h2><strong>The Secret of Self Hypnosis Revealed</strong></h2>
<p>1. The reason people like self hypnosis is because you don’t have to give over control to an outside hypnotist. All you have to do is work out what you want to achieve and how long you want to be under each day.</p>
<p>2. There are a lot of ways that you can perform self hypnosis but I think the very best is to get a CD. This works so well because you don’t have to have any skills. You just buy the CD and then listen to it everyday for an hour of so.</p>
<p>3. The way the CD works is that each one will focus on some aspect of your life that you would like to enhance. Like giving up smoking for instance. Once you have been guided into trace you will then be given positive messages direct into your subconscious that will make smoking seem stupid.</p>
<p>4. The <em>secret of self hypnosis</em> is that it can help with all manner of problems in you life and even disease. The reason for this is that if you are ill and are constantly feeling down your immune system will be low and you will get worse. But if you use positive self hypnosis you will start to feel like there is nothing wrong with you and pretty soon you will be fine.</p>

<p>As few year back I asked myself the simple question “can I <strong>learn to hypnotize someone</strong>” and I found that the rabbit hole goes very deep. By the time I learned the answer I had been through a lot of adventures and even started my own hypnosis websites!</p>
<div style="padding: 5px; float: right;"><a title="Learn to Hypnotize Someone" href="http://www.ehypnosisinduction.com/course" target="_blank"><img style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4091/5187627879_63fb29a904_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Learn to Hypnotize Someone" width="240" height="135" title="Learn to Hypnotize Someone    Is This Mind Control?" /></a><br />

<p>As first I was just interested but then I started to read more and more and found out that if I could learn to hypnotize people without them knowing I could influence a lot of situations in my life and start to get what I want more quickly</p>
<p>Not that I wanted to learn mind control at first, it was just that I needed to be more persuasive and less of a wimp.</p>
<p>WHAT IS HYPNOSIS?</p>
<p>This is the first thing I learn and I was surprise to find out that people are hypnotize all the time. It’s just a state of mind where the hypnotists can bypass the critical mind and talk direct to the subconscious. This is used a lot in advertising and is why some adverts seem so attractive.</p>
<p>So there is nothing to fear from hypnosis, you are just using the same power that people go through every day when they fall into a day dream of loose track of time.</p>
<p>Have you every got home from work and wondered where the day went?</p>
<p>You where in a hypnotic state the whole time and didn&#8217;t even know it!</p>
<h2>Learn to Hypnotize Someone In 3 Steps</h2>
<p>LET’S GET INTO SOME TACTICS.</p>
<p>1. The first thing you need to do is to be able to look at a person very closely. Notice their heart beat and how flushed their face looks. All these clues will tell you how deeply in trance that person is at the moment. (We are all in a certain stage of trance.)</p>
<p>2. You must gain a strong rapport with a person before they will let you hypnotize them. You need to treat the person like family or your best friend. Look deep into their eyes and smile. All this will help you build rapport.</p>
<p>3. Now the final step is the hypnotic scripts. I spent months trying to work out what to say to put a person under and then I discovered a whole world of scripts that have been proven to work every time. All you need to do is hop onto YouTube and find the self hypnosis videos with the most hits (There are 1000’s of them). Then you just copy the script word for word when you are hypnotizing a person.</p>
<p>Final thoughts.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this shortcut to <em>Learn to Hypnotize Someone</em>, I believe that if you want to learn something fast you just need to model the “best” and that is exactly what I have done with this simple method.</p>

<p>Covert hypnosis!</p>
<p>This is the process of putting the subject into trance with just hypnotics words. You don’t even have to get them to shut their eyes and it&#8217;s not too difficult to learn.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at a few of the things you can do to get this working for you.</p>
<h2>4 Steps to Hypnotize Someone Without Them Knowing</h2>
<p>1. Think about you voice &#8211; this is the most important part of learning <em>hypnotize someone without them knowing</em>, because you need to combine you tone, pitch and the actual words to make it effective. Have a look at some hypnosis videos on YouTube and think about how they talk.</p>
<p>2. Body language &#8211; this is also very important and to build rapport you need to think about how you act around close friends and family.</p>
<p>3. Be an observer &#8211; you need to start noticing subtle changes in your subject. One common part of covert hypnosis is to mirror the breathing which will build rapport even faster.</p>
<p>4. Be a master &#8211; this simply means that you should learn everything you can about covert hypnosis before you ever start to practice on people. This because you will often be in a situation where you have induced a trance and will not know where to go from there.</p>
<p>Final thoughts.</p>
<p>You will not learn this skill over night but if you practice everyday you will easily be able to hypnotize someone without them knowing.</p>
<p>The only other thing I would say is that this kind of hypnosis works best when you use it in a positive way. You’re not trying to be evil here, you just want to stack the odds in your favor  and use just a little convert hypnosis every day to make things go your way.</p>
<p>If you just follow that simple rule your life will be on an upward spiral.</p>

<p>The use of self hypnosis comes in many forms but the easiest way to get started is with a recording. Because you don’t have to make any effort, you just listen to the audio every day and then positive chances start to occur in your life.</p>
<p>So all you have to do is decide what you want to achieve then jump onto google and get the super cheap recordings&#8230;simple.</p>
<p>The reason that subliminal self hypnosis works so well is that your subconscious mind does not decide what to believe. If it hears “I’m a millionaire” enough times it will believe it and you will start to notice money making ideas all over the place.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Does Self Hypnosis Work &#8211; Yes!</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>The is the real power of the “secret” not some amazing gift given to you by the universe. It’s your power to notice opportunities that is being enhanced.</p>
<p>Below you will find some tips to make self hypnosis work for you.</p>
<p>1. Before you listen to the recording you must make sure that you are not going to be disrupted half way though. Let your family know that you are going to be away for half an hour and then find a quiet room and look the door. This may sound harsh but it is super important.</p>
<p>2. Clear your mind of thoughts about your day. You can do this by just noticing your breathing.</p>
<p>3. Become relaxed. Most of the time the recording will help you with this.</p>
<p>4. Make sure that you choose the change that is going to have the most positive effect in your life. For instance if you smoke but also want to make a million dollars I would go for the smoking first because it will help with all other aspects of your life.</p>
<p>5. You need to make self hypnosis a daily habit because changes never happen over night. It might take your a year to achieve your goal but as long as you have the unbreakable daily habit you will get there in the end.</p>
<p>I hope that helped you find out <em>Does Self Hypnosis Work</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Hypnosis for Panic Attacks:</strong> It’s perfectly natural to panic about things occasionally, in fact this is just your body telling you that there is something you need to deal with and sort out. The problem comes when you feel this feeling all of the time and for no good reason. As you know panic attacks can make you feel terrible and lead to all sorts of problems in your life.</p>

<p>There are a surprisingly large amount of people who experience panic attacks and even though this may only happen to you once in a while it’s a good ideas to find a way that you can quickly feel better.</p>
<p>In that past people would turn to drugs and all manner of chemicals to ease their panic. Although these where effective for a time, they ultimately lead to more problems as the body becomes dependent on such things and you cannot feel safe without them.</p>
<p>Well luckily there is another way and in this article we’re going to look at how you might ease your panic using just <strong>hypnosis for panic attacks</strong> as a natural and effective way to feel normal again.</p>
<p>The great thing about <em>hypnosis for panic attacks</em> is that it can deal with the common symptoms very quickly and effectively, but also work on the subconscious long term causes of your panic so that you can have long term peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Hypnosis for Panic Attacks Get Started</h2>
<p>The first step is to contact your local hypnotherapist and have a consultation. This is needed because not everyone is open to hypnotherapy and he or she will need to make sure that the process is going to have benefit for you.</p>
<p>Once you pass this simple test the sessions can begin and they are something that you will look forward to each week.</p>
<p>When in the hypnotic state the hypnotist can work on your subconscious mind and the causes of your problem.</p>
<p>Final thoughts</p>
<p>I think hypnotherapy is always the best place to start with your panic attacks because it is a natural and cost effective way to feel better. You can also have a long term benefit in that you will have been deeply cured, not just had your symptoms covered up with drugs.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>In this article you are going to lean the <em>covert hypnosis manual operator</em> that will allow you to gain a deep knowledge of suggestion. This will allow you to command others to do what you ask, without them even knowing that any hypnosis is happening at all.</p>
<p>STEP 1 &#8211; You need to get attention and gain rapport</p>
<p>Without the full attention of your subject you will never be able to induce hypnosis, and building a good rapport will let you put them in a relaxed state with words that seem magnetic.</p>
<p>1. You should listen very closely to your subject and even lean in a little.<br />
2. You should smile when they are talking and show that you are very enthusiastic about what they are saying.<br />
3. Show that you have the same interests and past times.<br />
4. The last part is to test if you have rapport with the body language check. You can do this by crossing you arms or legs and seeing if they copy you.</p>
<p>STEP 2 &#8211; Time for the trance.</p>
<p>In covert hypnosis the trance is the most tricky part. You are not going to be able to take them though the usual script or swing a pendulum back and forth in front of their eyes. So you need to be more subtle and have the person hanging off your every word.</p>
<p>To master this most difficult task you should study people in power and ask yourself what it is about them that makes you believe even word they say instantly. Powerful people are often those who have studied the covert hypnosis manual operator.</p>
<p>STEP 3 &#8211; Make some initial suggestions</p>
<p>At some point you are going to have to take the bull by the horns and actually start to offer suggestions, to see if your trance is working and if you have enough rapport. The best way to do this is by using sentences that already suggest that you are right and that they should be listening to what you say.</p>
<h2>Top 3 Covert Hypnosis Manual Operator</h2>
<p>There are 3 examples below and you can start to make up you own once you have the idea:</p>
<p>* I’m going to the mall today, come with me.<br />
* We will continue this phone call tomorrow when we have the sales figures in front of us.<br />
* The fist thing you will notice about this house is the light and airy rooms , the second is the the low cost compared with other homes in the area.</p>

<p>This is often used by public speakers and politicians but a more sinister side is that men also sometimes use this tactic to pick up women.</p>
<p>But the thing to remember is that you can only ever use covert hypnosis to encourage someone to do something that they would have done anyway. Which is where the art of persuasion comes in.</p>
<p>You ultimate goal as a covert hypnotists is to change the opinions of the subject rather than control their mind. This method is often use to help with addictions and other debilitating disease.</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>The Art of Covert Hypnosis is not Evil!</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>But you can forget about trying to get that subject to go into trance in the conventional way by swinging a watch in front of their eyes.</p>
<p>Your goal is to just say convincing words that put them right under.</p>
<p>The first step in <em>the art of covert hypnosis</em> is always building rapport and you know how to do this already. Think about your friends and family. If you told them something they would believe it right away or even obey your commands. You need to practice meeting people for the first time and having an instant connection with them by giving truthful compliment and being interested.</p>
<p>Once you have rapport with the person you could move into telling them a hypnotic story that would put them into a trance.</p>
<p>The best way to start a hypnotic story is to use a phrase like “imagine if&#8230;”</p>
<p>This will help the subject let go of reality and give you the ability to create a new reality for them.</p>
<p>Final thoughts.</p>
<p>If you want to learn covert hypnosis just listen to politicians speak or go to your local car dealership and talk to the best salesman, they all know the secrets and you can easily learn this stuff as well.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how much this can just make your personal relationships much deeper and more engaging.</p>
