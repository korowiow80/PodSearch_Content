<p>HOW TO KNOW WHEN TO GET RID OF YOUR CAR</p>
<p>Your Vehicle is no longer an asset and becomes a liability when:</p>
<p>* You&#8217;re unable to find a buyer to take it off your hands.<br />
* It was totalled in an accident &amp; has been written off.<br />
* It has little or no trade-in value.<br />
* It&#8217;s a lemon that you don&#8217;t want to pass off on to someone else.<br />
* You don&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of selling it.<br />
* It costs more to fix than it&#8217;s worth.<br />
* It&#8217;s been sitting so long that it doesn&#8217;t work anymore.</p>
<p>HOW JUNKING A CAR HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>People often think of an auto junkyard as just another dump – but present day junkyards are actually a form of recycling and easy on the environment. Most junk cars that end up in a junkyard are either sold at auctions or sold for scrap. In fact, junkyards provide steel and many other metals to the building and car industries, ensuring that the metals from a junked car continue to be used for other vital purposes and help save important natural resources, as well. In addition, the modern junkyard is regulated by federal and state laws that have strict guidelines on the draining and disposal of all fluids from junk cars, so the junkyard is no longer a threat to the ground water in the area.</p>
<p>ENJOY THE BENEFITS</p>
<p>Pat yourself on the back and know that by you junking your car you are in actual fact earning yourself some well earned cash and at the same time helping the environment.</p>
<p><span class="Text">No title? Not to worry&#8230;. The local Licensing department has the forms. You will need a form releasing you of liability. You simply fill out the form stating that you DO NOT own the Body and that it is abandoned.</span></p>

<p>HOW TO KNOW WHEN TO GET RID OF YOUR CAR</p>
<p>Your Vehicle is no longer an asset and becomes a liability when:</p>
<p>* You&#8217;re unable to find a buyer to take it off your hands.<br />
* It was totalled in an accident &amp; has been written off.<br />
* It has little or no trade-in value.<br />
* It&#8217;s a lemon that you don&#8217;t want to pass off on to someone else.<br />
* You don&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of selling it.<br />
* It costs more to fix than it&#8217;s worth.<br />
* It&#8217;s been sitting so long that it doesn&#8217;t work anymore.</p>
<p>HOW JUNKING A CAR HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>People often think of an auto junkyard as just another dump – but present day junkyards are actually a form of recycling and easy on the environment. Most junk cars that end up in a junkyard are either sold at auctions or sold for scrap. In fact, junkyards provide steel and many other metals to the building and car industries, ensuring that the metals from a junked car continue to be used for other vital purposes and help save important natural resources, as well. In addition, the modern junkyard is regulated by federal and state laws that have strict guidelines on the draining and disposal of all fluids from junk cars, so the junkyard is no longer a threat to the ground water in the area.</p>
<p>ENJOY THE BENEFITS</p>
<p>Pat yourself on the back and know that by you junking your car you are in actual fact earning yourself some well earned cash and at the same time helping the environment.</p>
<p><span class="Text">No title? Not to worry&#8230;. The local Licensing department has the forms. You will need a form releasing you of liability. You simply fill out the form stating that you DO NOT own the Body and that it is abandoned.</span></p>

<p>HOW JUNKING A CAR HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>People often think of an auto junkyard as just another dump – but present day junkyards are actually a form of recycling and easy on the environment. Most junk cars that end up in a junkyard are either sold at auctions or sold for scrap. In fact, junkyards provide steel and many other metals to the building and car industries, ensuring that the metals from a junked car continue to be used for other vital purposes and help save important natural resources, as well. In addition, the modern junkyard is regulated by federal and state laws that have strict guidelines on the draining and disposal of all fluids from junk cars, so the junkyard is no longer a threat to the ground water in the area.</p>
<p>ENJOY THE BENEFITS</p>
<p>Pat yourself on the back and know that by you junking your car you are in actual fact earning yourself some well earned cash and at the same time helping the environment.</p>

<p>HOW TO KNOW WHEN TO GET RID OF YOUR CAR</p>
<p>Your Vehicle is no longer an asset and becomes a liability when:</p>
<p>* You&#8217;re unable to find a buyer to take it off your hands.<br />
* It was totalled in an accident &amp; has been written off.<br />
* It has little or no trade-in value.<br />
* It&#8217;s a lemon that you don&#8217;t want to pass off on to someone else.<br />
* You don&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of selling it.<br />
* It costs more to fix than it&#8217;s worth.<br />
* It&#8217;s been sitting so long that it doesn&#8217;t work anymore.</p>
<p>HOW JUNKING A CAR HELPS THE ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>People often think of an auto junkyard as just another dump – but present day junkyards are actually a form of recycling and easy on the environment. Most junk cars that end up in a junkyard are either sold at auctions or sold for scrap. In fact, junkyards provide steel and many other metals to the building and car industries, ensuring that the metals from a junked car continue to be used for other vital purposes and help save important natural resources, as well. In addition, the modern junkyard is regulated by federal and state laws that have strict guidelines on the draining and disposal of all fluids from junk cars, so the junkyard is no longer a threat to the ground water in the area.</p>
<p>ENJOY THE BENEFITS</p>
