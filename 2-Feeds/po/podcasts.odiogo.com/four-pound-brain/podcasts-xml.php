      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this Filtrete air filter review, we&#8217;ll cover the various filtration products offered by 3M and discuss how they can improve the quality of air in your home. 3M makes a wide variety of great products, and the Filtrete air filters are no exception.</p>
<p>The Filtrete air filter lineup features electrostatically-charged technology for forced air heating and cooling systems, as well as media air cleaning systems. Let&#8217;s take a look at the different options available.</p>
<h2>High Performance 1&#8243; Filters</h2>
<p>These are designed to capture at least 90% of the large airborne particles from the air that passes through the filter. They feature a microparticle rating of 1200 or higher and even capture smog, smoke, and particles carrying viruses.</p>
<h2>Air Cleaning 1&#8243; Filters</h2>
<p>Featuring a microparticle performance rating of 700 to 1000, these non-electrostatic filters help to eliminate microscopic allergens such as smoke and dust, as well as larger ones like pet dander and mold spores.</p>
<h2>High Air Flow 1&#8243; Filters</h2>
<p>Ideal for high-velocity equipment, these filters have a microparticle rating of 200 to 600 and are extremely effective at reducing pet dander, pollen, household dust, and mold spores.</p>
<h2>Media Air Cleaner 4&#8243; Filters</h2>
<p>Specifically designed for whole house air cleaners, these filters carry a 1550 microparticle rating and capture dust mite debris, pollen, and mold spores.</p>
<p>Hopefully this Filtrete air filter review has given you a better picture of the different options offered by 3M. Regardless of the filter you choose, we&#8217;re pretty confident that you&#8217;ll notice a difference in the overall air quality in your home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ants in the house? This can seem like an overwhelming problem, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. This is not an issue that should be put off, though. Read below to figure out how to get rid of ants that seem to be taking over your household.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Brainstorm for ideas. Surely a neighbor or two has had an ant problem. Ask what they did to get rid of the bugs. Or do some research with a friend to come up with the best ways to clear your house of the ant problem.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Make sure all of your food is in a sealed container so the ants cannot get into it. Ants that are hungry will go in other places to find food.  They will be following chemical trails that are left by other ants.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Get laurel leaves, because they work in keeping ants away from specific areas.  Try putting the laurel in a sugar can.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Use chalk to keep ants away from the kitchen. Ants move away from any lines of chalk. Plan these chalk lines with caution.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Corn meal also works. This is good for homes with pets or children, as this ingredient is not poisonous. Ants will carry it home to eat it, but cannot digest it. Put corn meal in areas where ants are likely to roam.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Boric acid also is beneficial in getting rid of ants.  It also is safe for humans to use.  Or you can pour about one tablespoon of maple syrup, or anything sweet that ants attract to on a flat plate or saucer.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Sprinkle boric acid around syrup so ants have to walk through it to access the syrup. You can even use a Q-tip to ensure distribution of this powder so the ants are more likely to come in contact with it.</li>
<li>The ants&#8217; skeleton is on the outside, also known as exoskeletons.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ants</li>
<li>Maple syrup</li>
<li>Boric acid</li>
<li>Laurel leaves</li>
<li>Q-tips</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Die shear testing is used to determine the strength of adhesion of a semiconductor die to its substrate. For example, it can be used for die pads of a lead frame or cavity of a hermatic package. But how do you calibrate die shear testers? Follow the steps below to learn of a productive process in die shear testing calibration.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Make sure your tester includes its basic components: a mechanism that will apply loads to die with an accuracy of plus or minus 5 percent of full scale or 50 grams, whichever is greater; a die contact tool that will allow for contact with full length of die edge to apply force from one end to another; provisions to make sure that tool is perpendicular to the die attach plane; provisions to make sure the die-holding fixture can be rotated so the die edge and contact tool will align to be parallel to each other; and a binocular microscope and lighting system. These items will ensure observation of the die and contact tool during testing.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Be aware of the force applied to the die during the testing. It will have to be sufficent to shear die from its mounting or twice the lower spec limit for the strength of the die shear, whichever happens first.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> There are failures in die testing.  These include meeting die shear strength requirements.  Also, there will be a separation that will occur at less than 1.25 times the minimum die shear strength or less than 50 percent adhesion of the die attaching material. The final failure is a separation that happens at twice the minimum die shear strength and if there is less than 1 percent adhesion of the die attach material.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Mode of separation should be classified as follows:  shearing of die itself with remaining silicon, separation of die from die attach material and separation of die and die attach material from substrate.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of die shear testing is generally to assess quality of the die-attach process, which includes integrity of materials and how capable processes are that are used in mounting die.</li>
<li>After initial contact is made and force application has commenced, the position of the tool shouldn&#8217;t change and should not contact die attach material or the substrate.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Die Tester with components</li>
<li>Die</li>
<li>Force to be applied</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you think you might have an eye for interior design, but are wondering how you can benefit from this skill and talent. <em>Wondering how to get into interior decorating?</em> Read the steps below to find out how you can put your ideas to good use, and even help others.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Don&#8217;t be afraid to sit around with others with the same goals and talk about what you can do. Bringing together more people to brainstorm is always beneficial, especially when talking optimistically about the future.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Interior decorating involves a career including creative skills that allow homes and business to have a more beautiful and comfortable feel, making it appealing to those who occupy the space. This is a job that would be have to be satisfying at the end of the day.  If the desire is there, becoming an interior decorator is possible. There is no special education or experience needed to enter this field, unless you want to be a certified decorator.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Work on training your eye, which already is sharp when it comes to design. When you look at a room, you know what looks good and see what should be changed. You can train your eye by studying what other people think are good designs. You also can educate yourself by taking courses, reading books, visiting Web sites or even talking with retailers of products used in decorating, i.e. paint, carpet, lighting, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Use your personal space to practice. As Dorothy said, &#8220;There&#8217;s no place like home.&#8221; You can start by rearranging furniture or painting your walls a different color. You can also volunteer your services to others who might be in need of interior decorating.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Make sure to keep samples of all of your work in a portfolio, including any documents that would show a person benefits of hiring you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now that you have established that you would like a career in interior design, you must decide whether you want to work for someone else or start your own business in the field. Get your name out there by networking with other professionals in the field and be sure to showcase your work.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>When first starting out, be reasonable with your pricing to get more business. Aim lower because your initial goal is to get more clients. Word-of-mouth is always the best advertising method. Once you have a firm clientele base, you can raise your prices a bit because people will associate your name with quality work, as long as the job is being done right.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We sometimes find ourselves in situations where meeting new people is possible. But talking to strangers is harder for some than others. Mingling and small talk go hand and hand,and is sometimes necessary for professional situations. Follow these steps below to learn how to mingle and small talk.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Don&#8217;t feel like you need others&#8217; approval.  Many people fear they will be rejected and this keeps them from talking to strangers in the room.  Try to let go of any negative feelings you may have and keep an optimistic attitude when approaching someone.  This will give you a confident look.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Be prepared before heading into the mingling situation. Think about topics to discuss, and that way you will be more comfortable when you start up a conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you have any discomfort, try to just release it.  If you are uncomfortable, chances are the person you are talking to will sense it, and he or she also will feel awkward about talking to you.  It is important to remain confident and positive.  Think about what type of person you would like to talk to, and try to have an attitude that resembles what you imagine.  For example, use confident body language like standing up straight and do not cross your arms.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Try to overcome shyness. This again brings us to letting go of any feelings of discomfort. It goes back to a lack of confidence which keeps us from talking to others. Having a confident self-image will make us look appealing to others.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Don&#8217;t wait for them to come to you.  Introduce yourself.  Be sure to say your name clearly so the person will remember it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Listen to others with an open ear.  People can tell when others aren&#8217;t really listening to them, and that can result in hurt feelings.  When you talk, you want others to listen as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Just be yourself- this will result in you feeling comfortable. You know who you are inside and out, so let others see it for themselves as well.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Small talk is temporary, and doesn&#8217;t have to last all night.  If you sense a conversation has a lull, end it by thanking the other person for talking with you and make your exit.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Confidence</li>
<li>Strangers</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are working to connect your sprinkler system and have made it to the valve connection process, but you don&#8217;t know how to hook your sprinkle systems wire valves? There are simple steps to follow to get the system up and running. Follow the procedure below and you will be able to keep your lawn wet with your sprinkler system and working valves.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The valve can be connected like a garden hose to an outdoor faucet. The faucet usually is located outside of the house. It also can be connected to a service line.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Be sure to shut off the water supply.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Cut a one-inch section out of the service line between the main shut off and the house.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add a compression tee fitting and an extra valve. This will allow the system&#8217;s water supply to be independently controlled and will not be connected to the house system.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>It might be a good idea to get a plumber or other professional to do this work.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve just purchased a new carpet, you&#8217;ll probably want to learn how to steam clean to remove stains. Or, perhaps you rent an apartment and you are moving out and you want to get some stains or dingy spots out to save your security deposit. Not to worry, you can follow the steps below to learn how to steam-clean and get that carpet looking great.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask around for references. Brainstorming to come up with the best quality product never hurts.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You will need to get a steam cleaner, which generally will use hot water and a pump vacuum. You also will place a cleaning solution inside the cleaner&#8217;s units. Then, the solution is injected into the carpet with deep pressure using jet nozzles that work the solution down as far as the carpet&#8217;s backing. This way, embedded dirt, soil, oil and even grease deposits are loosened and are brought into the machine.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Choose your method of steam cleaning. There generally are two ways to do it. The first uses a traffic lane cleaner that is sprayed into the lanes of the carpet and then works its way into the carpet fibers. Using a hot water extractor, which injects the solution into the fibers, the entire area is cleaned. The other way uses a pre-spray over the carpet, which is worked into the fibers.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to do thorough research before purchasing your steam-cleaning machine. There are many types available on the market, but perusing your way through reviews and testimonials should bring you the perfect fit.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Steam-cleaner</li>
<li>Hot water</li>
<li>Carpet</li>
<li>Cleaning solution</li>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the inserted disc is rewritable.  If it is not, it may be ruined, or it simply won&#8217;t work with the program.</li>
<li>Burning the rewritable disc should do the job, but if that does not work, try another one in its place.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Warnings</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know how to measure for a bra at home? This might be hard to believe, but a lot of women wear the wrong size bra. It can be embarrassing to be sized at a store because some women just need their privacy. They can be appeased by knowing that there are ways to measure for their correct bra size in the comfort of their own homes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> What are some ways one might think to measure a bra? Try to brainstorm for ideas before just running out to the store and buying what you think is your right size. It is a much better idea to find your correct size than to wear something that doesn&#8217;t fit, and be uncomfortable when wearing the bra.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Know that the bra doesn&#8217;t have to be an absolute perfect fit. The goal is to fit the woman&#8217;s breasts to a position that an ideal bra would support, with weight suspended in a comfortable fashion. This is an optional step but if you cannot find a bra with good support, continue with the measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Measure the band size.  You should run a tape measure all the way around your body just below your breasts and make a measurement in inches. The tape measure should be horizontal and snug to your body, with your arms down. If the measurement doesn&#8217;t fall on an exact bra size, round to the nearest one. For example, if you came up with 33, you will be a 34 band size.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now it is time to measure your bust. Measure loosely around the fullest portion of your bust, in inches. If you are not using a bra, bend so that your back is parallel to the floor and then measure around your chest, at the nipples. Again, round the measurement to the nearest whole number.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Calculating the cup size can seem tricky but it doesn&#8217;t have to be.  Subtract the bust measurement from the band measurement and use the following guidelines: less than one inch is a AA, one inch is A, two inches is B, three inches is C, four inches is D, five inches is DD, six inches is DDD, seven inches is DDDD, eight inches is FF and nine inches is G.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Next, go to the store and try on a bra with the size you have come up with to make sure it is a fit. Be sure to check the cup size.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A fitting bra band should be tight enough so the bra supports without weighing down on the straps.</li>
<li>You should be able to run your fingers around the inside of the band, but the band should not be loose.</li>
<li>Some manufacturers size bras and clothing differently, so do not get discouraged if the bra size you measured does not fit in a store.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring tape</li>
<li>Test bra (optional)</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are calculating payroll for a military employee, or maybe you are in the military and want to make sure your paycheck is accurate. Is there a specific formula to use to determine your hours? Of course there is. Follow the steps below to learn how to read military time on a payroll.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open up Microsoft Excel, because this program works best for payroll as it uses spreadsheets and calculates columns automatically.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your start time in the military time format, i.e. 8 a.m. is 0800 hrs., etc.  Do the same with your ending time.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Figure out how much you make in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Figure out how many hours you have worked by subtracting your start time from your end time.  For instance, you started at 0800 hrs and ended at 1700 hrs (5 p.m.).  That will give you nine hours.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Multiple your hourly rate by the number of hours you have worked, and then subtract any deductions, i.e. taxes.  The result will be your take-home pay or that for the employee you are writing the payroll for.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A simple formula for figuring out military hours is this: If it is before noon, the number is the same as the regular time on the hour. For example, 0700 hrs is 7 a.m. After noon, you will add 12 to the time to get your military time.  For example, 3 p.m. is 1500 hrs. and so on.</li>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Server names like ns1.nixcraft.net can be used as a vanity DNS for theos.in domain. There are three things to be aware of:  your real DNS server, the Vanity DNS and the IP address for both the real and vanity servers.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> For example, your real DNS server is ns1.nixcraft.net and your vanity DNS is ns1.theos.in.  Your IP address for both is 202.54.1.20.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Another example is DNS server ns2.nixcraft.net with a vanity DNS ns2.theos.in and the above listed IP address.  It just takes a little tweaking, but it can be done with ease.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the price of gasoline as high as it is today, popular alternatives are hybrid vehicles, carpooling and taking public transportation to work and town on the weekends. But what else can we do? There is the notion of using hydrogen for fuel. Follow the steps below to learn how to make hydrogen gas.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Since hydrogen ultimately is consumed by a pollution-free chemical reaction in a fuel cell, it combines with oxygen to produce resources like electricity, water and waste heat. It is seen as very abundant and is found in water, fossil fuels, plants and animals.  It can be obtained from water using electrolysis or splitting water molecules with electricity.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The fuel cells typically are compatible with cold winters, such as in the state of Washington.  It starts quickly and runs at moderate temperatures like 150 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hydrogen-powered vehicles are not limited by batteries. The determination is the amount of fuel in the storage tank.  Recent developments for storage include carbon absorption, or refrigerated pressurized tanks that can store large amounts of hydrogen.</p>
<p><em>Warnings</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen as gas or fuel is an up and coming technology and should be left to the experts. Civilians should not to create fuel out of hydrogen at their homes, because there is danger of possible explosions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen</li>
<li>Tanks</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your fish aquarium infested with algae, giving your tank an unpleasant appearance? Want to know how to get rid of algae in a fish tank? There are ways to get rid of this gross substance, which also will improve the quality of life for your fish. Read the tips below to learn ways to get rid of the algae and keep that aquarium clean in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Do you have any friends or family that own an aquarium? Ask them about upkeep, and getting rid of the algae. What works best for them? Try that technique. If you still are having the problem, read below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Know that there are different algae types that can grow in an aquarium, and be prepared to fight them off.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Lower your nutrient levels in the tank. This will get rid of any slime algae in the aquarium. Also change the water, and siphon away the slime.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lower your light levels because that which is good for plant growth is also beneficial for growth of algae.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Keep sunlight away from the aquarium, because this too will help in algae growth.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Get some grazing snails because they will eat some kind of algae.  Also get a gentle scrubbing pad if you have an acrylic aquarium. You can scrub away the algae infesting your tank.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Get a razor blade to scrape tanks made of glass, but be careful not to scratch the glass.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Some fish eat algae, so purchase some of them. This is your best route to take as it is natural, and actually should be the first fish in your tank.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Algae spores are found everywhere, and can also be inside your aquarium, even if new. Spores will tend to grow if there is plenty of light and nutrients- considered the right conditions.</li>
<li>Soak new plants in a solution of one part bleach to 20 parts water. Dip the plant in the solution for about two minutes and rinse. Dip the plant in water that is treated with a dechlorinator. This will neutralize remaining bleach before you add your plant to the tank.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Fish aquarium</li>
<li>Water-bleach solution</li>
<li>Algae-eating fish</li>
<li>Grazing snails</li>
<li>Dark environment</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s almost time for bed and you are completely relaxed until the phone rings. You know it is one of those pesky telemarketers. They call at the most inopportune times: during dinner, early in the morning, or late at night- when they know you will be home. So how do you get rid of unwanted phone calls? Not to fret; there are many ways of getting rid of these nasty calls. Read on to learn how.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Ask your friends and neighbors what they do about telemarketers, and feel free to heed their advice.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sign up for the national do-not-call registry. See the Web site listed below to sign up for this convenient service that blocks calls from your home. Once you are on this list, telemarketers must remove your number from their calling agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Unfortunately, some groups, such as non-profit organizations, are not covered in the do-not-call registry. But some groups have rules in that if you ask them not to call, they are required not to bother you again.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you are not joining the registry, and are receiving calls, ask the telemarketer to remove your name from the list.  Or you can tell them they have the wrong number, if your conscience doesn&#8217;t get the better of you.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>When utilizing the do-not-call registry, know that it takes some time to take effect before you will notice fewer calls. It also doesn&#8217;t last forever. You might have to check back occasionally to ensure that your number is still on the list.</li>
<li>When telling a company or group not to call you, keep a record of that organization&#8217;s name and when you requested your removal. If they call again, you will be prepared to handle the situation.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to learn how to remove glued down carpet? Removing glued down carpeting can be a bit of a challenge and will certainly test our patience, but it&#8217;s worth it in the end to see the revealed, beautiful flooring. If you are stuck with some glued down carpet in your home, follow these steps below to get the glued down carpet and perhaps reveal some hardwood floors.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Do you know anyone who took on this remodeling process? What did they do to get the glued down carpet up?  Try this method and see if it works. If you are still dealing with a sticky carpet, read on to learn more tricks to get that floor underneath out in the open.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Lift the carpet as much as you can and figure out what type of glue you are working with.  If it appears to be tan or dark brown in color, it has a tar base. You will need mineral spirits to remove it. If it has a yellow color, you will be using general adhesive.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Put on some rubber gloves for hand protection.  Since adhesive removers can have strong fumes, it might be a good idea to put on a fan nearby to circulate the air around you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Chip away some of the excess glue.  Using a paintbrush or sponge, dampen the glue with your spirits or adhesive and make sure to go with guidelines from the product manufacturer.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Let the solution set until it loosens the glue. Using a plastic putty knife, scrape away the old glue. Be sure not to damage the floor underneath. When you have scraped off everything you can, apply more mineral spirits or adhesive to an old rag or towel, and use that to scrub off remaining glue residue.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Repeat the above steps until all the glue is gone. Take a mop and bucket to the area after you are done, and let it dry.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> If you plan on sanding or using electrical equipment in the room, make sure the flooring is dry before doing so.  It is a good idea to let the room sit for a good day before using your equipment on the exposed floor.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If you find this job to be too challenging, hire a professional or even get a friend to help you.</li>
<li>When getting your adhesive remover, check with companies that make adhesives. You might be able to find your product there.</li>
<li>Adhesive removers usually have a solvent base, which means they have a high flammability rate and fumes are toxic. With that being said, wear a face mask and keep it away from an open flame.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Adhesive remover</li>
<li>Mineral spirits</li>
<li>Paintbrush or sponge</li>
<li>Plastic putty knife</li>
<li>Rubber gloves</li>
<li>Old towels or rags (not valued)</li>
<li>Fan (for air circulation)</li>
<li>Sealant for floor type</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Washing a pillow case is similar to working with clothing- as long as you follow the instructions on a tag. Learning how to remove blood spots from cotton pillow cases can be tricky, though, but it can be done. If you have a nasty blood spot on your cotton pillow case, read below to learn how to get it out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Ask around to your friends, family and even co-workers as to how they would treat this stain, or have dealt with it in the past. Try their method, and if you are still stuck with a blood spot on your cotton pillow case, keep reading to figure out how to get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If possible, remove the stain when it is wet. Dried blood is more difficult to remove, but it is not impossible. If the blood is dry, put the pillow case in cold water for at least 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Squeeze any extra water from the soaked pillow case. Add some hydrogen peroxide to the stain. Your pillow case should not have a reaction. Use this with caution.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> The blood will create a bubbling, which is hydrogen peroxide reacting to the blood and breaking it apart. You will let your pillow case sit for about a minute, and then scrub the stained area. Follow up by rinsing in cold water.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> If you still have a stain, repeat steps two through four. Make sure that you completely rinse the pillow case to get rid of the hydrogen peroxide before using the clean pillow case, and you can finish the process by washing it in a regular load of laundry to ensure its cleanliness.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The fresher the bloodstain is, the easier it is to get it out.</li>
<li>Hydrogen peroxide is affordable and can be found in the pharmacy area of the grocery store. When using this product, know that it also will react to any open wounds you may have on your skin.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Hydrogen peroxide</li>
<li>Cold water</li>
<li>Old toothbrush</li>
<li>Soiled cotton pillow case</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your clothing or fabric is soiled with a grease stain, it is not the end of the world if you know how to remove a grease stain. You can use household items to get rid of this mess. This won&#8217;t take forever either. Take a look at the steps below to learn just how to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Ask around to your loved ones if they have had this problem, and what they did, and what products they used, to get rid of the stain. Try these techniques. If you still have grease stains, try some of the ideas listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Get some liquid dish detergent and cover your grease spot with it. Know that detergent with no color generally works better. If you are using a colored detergent, dilute it in water because this can stain your clothing or fabric.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Rinse with white vinegar to remove the detergent, and wash your clothing or fabric as you normally would.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> If you have a stubborn stain that doesn&#8217;t want to come out, repeat steps two through four.  Bask in the glory that you have removed a grease stain.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t give up if the stain doesn&#8217;t seem to be coming up.  Note:  a white polo shirt was once marked with grease from a boat engine, and the grease was removed using the above method.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Liquid dish detergent (clear or diluted color)</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>White vinegar</li>
<li>Washing machine</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learning how to remove scratches from plastic eyeglasses is a skill that will come in handy often. A lot of glasses and sunglasses are made from plastic, which is easy to scratch. Don&#8217;t discard your glasses if they are scratched because this problem can be fixed. Also, don&#8217;t walk around with lines obscuring your sight.  Read below to be enlightened on how to remove scratches from your plastic eyewear.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Think about your colleagues, friends and family and who of them wears glasses. Ask the ones who need some vision assistance how they deal with eyeglass scratches (sticking to the plastic kind) and try what has worked for them.  Still dealing with a scratch?  Keep reading.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Get some spray-cleaner typically used for dusting wood surfaces. This will especially work well if your glasses have a scratch coating that is coming off. Spray the cleaner on a rag and wipe it all over your plastic lenses, then wash off with soapy water. Repeat two to three times and your lenses should be back to good, scratch-free.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find some furniture polish. This will work on even badly scratched plastic. Put the polish on a soft cloth, then rub on lenses for at least three minutes. Then, wash and dry. The scratches should no longer be there. One negative thing side effect about furniture polish, however, is the smell.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> For a different approach, try cigarette ashes. Rub the ashes in the cracks of the scratches, using your fingers. Your glasses should wash clean. Repeat, rubbing for a few minutes, at least two times and your lenses should be scratch-free. This is a less popular technique, but has worked in the past.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not try the above tips on glass lenses.  Scratches cannot be removed from glass lenses and if you try to treat the lens, you can ruin the glass.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Spray-cleaner for dusting</li>
<li>Furniture polish</li>
<li>Cigarette ashes</li>
<li>Soap and water</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know how to get rid of knots in your back? Knots in your back can be quite painful, and working them out can be quite a daunting task. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be as hard as it seems. Follow the steps below to learn how to get rid of those knots in your back, without hurting your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Have any friends who have complained of a stiff neck or back? How did they resolve the problem? Try the methods they used to see if it really worked.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find a buddy to help you with your knots because it will be difficult to do this yourself. Get comfortable, and have your friend place their hands on your shoulders and gently squeeze to determine how tight your shoulders are.  Have them locate your spine, because they will not want to apply pressure there, or on the shoulder blades.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Using the elbow, lean into the top part of the shoulder. He or she should ask you if you feel enough pressure, so advise them if you need more or less pressure at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Make sure to keep the lines of communication open, alerting your friend if you feel any pain or discomfort, or if your friend is not being affective to your back knots.  Give guidance while the knots are being worked out.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your friend is careful during this massage session; you do not want to end up worse than before this method started.</li>
<li>If your knots do not go away, it might be beneficial to see a chiropractor to make sure it is nothing serious.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Friend to work out your knots</li>
<li>Comfortable place to lie down</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to know how to get rid of shin splints? Shin splints are due to repeated impact on the larger shin bone, known as the tibia. Usually, the calves tend to flex when feet make a hard impact. It also can be because your body is not used to running and has lost the instinct. Read below to find out how you can get rid of your shin splints.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you are an athlete, ask other athletes what they do. Chances are, they have had this problem and had to resolve it. If not, ask around or simply do some research. With some persistence, the answer should come to you.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> This is an injury you have sustained, and you can heal it with rest.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If you have trouble with everyday activities such as walking, see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow your doctor-prescribed regimen and get the rest, around three weeks. You are healed when you can stamp your heal down with the same amount of force applied when walking, until you feel a slight pain. Do this once every other day.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Be careful when performing the heal stamp, not to injure yourself. Stop as soon as you feel any pain.</li>
<li>Work back into your routine gradually, starting with short walks, working your way up to a jog and running again.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Rest</li>
<li>Flat surface (for stamping)</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to learn how to make hanging flower baskets? Hanging flower baskets can be a great way to brighten up the outside of your house, adding color to your front porch and lawn, and can also be a great compliment to a garden. If you have some great ideas for a basket but are not quite sure how to put the package together, read below for some great tips.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Don&#8217;t be afraid to come up with your ideas, using brainstorming, such as what types of flowers to put in the basket. Common sense tells you that a lot of color should be used in such a piece, so don&#8217;t be afraid to use a variety of flowers to make a beautiful basket.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The challenging question is &#8211; what comes first, the basket or the flower? Well, it depends. Some choose the basket first and then decide on what floral arrangements they will use. The basket forms the foundation for this piece of gardening.  So go to a store and pick up a basket that catches your eye, be it the shape, style or even color of it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> It is now time to add the flowers. Your choice is detrimental to the success of your project. The location of the basket will depend on your decision, for sun and shade purposes.  You also will want to pick up some potting mix, either from the store or made by you or another, liquid fertilizer, bonemeal and figure out your watering methods.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Use your creativity to bring it all together!  Don&#8217;t be too timid to boast your work in front of your neighbors.</p>
<p><em>Tips</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Be sure to follow instructions on any flowers that you purchase. It would be a shame if you have a beautiful basket but the planting procedure does not work out.  If something does go wrong, you can head back to the garden shop and give it another go.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Items Needed</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Hanging basket</li>
<li>Flowers</li>
<li>Potting mix</li>
<li>Liquid fertilizer</li>
<li>Bonemeal</li>
<li>Water</li>
</ul>
