They do not work in tackling those not on the animal however&#8211;such as the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>One of the nice things about this age of going green is that there are new products coming out that are less topic options than in the past.</p>
<p><em>Shoo Tags™</em> is one of these products that made a hit at one of the big pet industry shows.</p>
<p>However, I did not find any scientific studies to support the claims although I did came across some discussions of how they don&#8217;t work for some people.</p>
<p>The shelf life of inactivated tags is two years and once on the pet, they are supposed to last up to four months.</p>
<p>Shoo! TAGS™ work by using frequencies embedded in the magnetic strip that are supposed to be similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schumann_resonances">Schumann Wave</a> and not like harmful radio frequencies.</p>
<p>The specific insects targeted by the tags do not like those energetics. (The manufacturers state that Shoo!TAG™ products do not interfere with radio frequencies or radio collars.)</p>
<p>Once on the pet (or human) it takes time for the energy field to extend the pest barrier frequencies into the energy field of the being wearing the tag.</p>
<p>During testing the manufacturers found that activation can take up to 36 hours.</p>
<p>They also found that animals that have weaker energy fields (those who are on or have recently taken steroid drugs, that have recently undergone surgery, or who are older) do not respond well to the product.</p>
<p>One of the misunderstood aspects of this product is that it does not kill the pests but simply slows them down and gets them to leave the pet&#8217;s energy field.</p>
<p>The tag frequency can be effected if they rub against other metal tags or become bent, scratched or damaged.</p>
<p>In addition, the company states that there could also be a problem if there are nearby fault lines, cell phone towers and large doses of pesticides.</p>
<p>The company states also that green products typically have around a 75% effective rate and so although <a href="/fleatreatment/shoo-tags-flea" target="_blank">ShooTAGS</a> is a nice option is can only be part of an entire flea control program.</p>

<p>There is a lot of talk about natural flea control these days but people are a bit confused about it.</p>
<p>Natural flea control doesn&#8217;t indicate that something is not toxic, only that it is made from natural ingredients.</p>
<p>Pyrethrins for instance, they are derived from a flower. In particular the <em>Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium</em> which is harvested around the world but particularly from Africa.</p>
<p>It is estimated that Kenya produces as much as 70% of the world&#8217;s supply of pyrethrins.</p>
<p>But even though the flea control product is made from a natural ingredient, an overdose can result in a toxic reaction in pets.</p>
<p>Adverse reactions include drooling, lethargy, muscle tremors, vomiting, seizures and even death.</p>
<p>One of the reasons it is important to do your research on flea control products and flea medications is because a lot of bad advice is floating around in cyberspace&#8211;and even in casual conversations.</p>
<p>There are six different pyrethrins (pyrethrin I &amp; II, cinevin I &amp; II, and jasmolin I &amp; II) but they are not specifically identified on the packaging of the products made from them&#8211;only as &#8220;pyrethrins.&#8221;</p>
<p>Always make sure to follow the directions on the packages of any flea medications you use. Also make sure you use the flea medication made specifically for the type of animal you have.</p>
<p>Dog products should only be used on dogs and cat products should only be used on cats.</p>
<p>Avoid breaking up a larger dose between animals since the wrong dosage could be toxic to you pet.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pfala/2402698820/sizes/m/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/dollar.jpg" alt="best flea treatment" width="424" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>One of the most asked questions is, &#8220;What is the best flea treatment?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer can vary greatly depending on who you talk to but the real question should be, &#8220;What is the best flea treatment for my pet and my household?&#8221;</p>
<p>For instance, in my area most people do not need to use flea control unless they head out on a trip or have company that arrives with a flea infested pet.</p>
<p>Because we live in the high altitude with arid conditions and temperatures that don&#8217;t allow a flea population to take hold and cycle, our biggest issues are from visitors with pets or from ticks.</p>
<p>A bath in non-toxic oatmeal shampoo (with suds left to sit for 10-15 minutes) is enough to thwart any fleas that might have been brought up to the area.</p>
<p>If you live in an area where feral animals invade your yard or strays visit often&#8211;your chances of a flea infestation can increase drastically.</p>
<p>Recently a reader wrote in about an infestation cycle at the beach.</p>
<p>Her problem was that rats were bringing fleas into the home where they multiplied and plagued both pets and humans.</p>
<p>So where you live is part of the consideration in coming up with a good solutions because beach living is certainly a bigger problem than where I live and regions vary as to what types of flea products you can obtain.</p>
<p>The other consideration concerns how much money you want to invest in products or services AND how much toxicity you are willing to bring into your home or yard.</p>
<p>Some products work better than others but the true secret is that you need to use the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY3UMJKMkzs" target="_blank">Triangle of Successful Flea Control</a> to tackle the issue.</p>
<p>This means treating the animal, interior area of the home, and the surrounding exterior areas at the same time.</p>
<p>Both the interior and exterior areas have to be treated at least every two weeks until you get the problem under control and then regularly after that to get rid of fleas for good.</p>
<p>Although some areas allegedly report a decrease in flea populations, I highly doubt that is the case. With more sophisticated options for treating fleas I think it is just that people are not encountering the same high level of problems as has been the case in the past and they are not calling in pest control people but treating it themselves or with services that provide less toxic options.</p>
<p>Anyway, I just wanted to make sure you don&#8217;t fall for the &#8220;best flea treatment is&#8230;&#8221; message.</p>
<p>My answer to the question is this, &#8220;<em>The best flea treatment is the one that works for you, eliminates fleas from your pet and your home safely, and that fits into your budget.</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>We all have our favorites so take the time to talk to your veterinarian or pet care professional to see what they recommend.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget that you can read <em>Flea Control Secrets</em> for help in sorting out the vast selection of products on the market (both natural and proprietary) and to learn about all the different options available to you and your pet.</p>

      <description>Recently Flea Control Secrets received an email from a subscriber (Peter) who had a multiple part inquiry.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.fleacontrolsecrets.com/learn-how-to-get-rid-of-fleas.html"><img class="alignright" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/identify-flea-for-pullout.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="242" /></a>Recently <em>Flea Control Secrets</em> received an email from a subscriber (Peter) who had a multiple part inquiry.</p>
<p>The person owns three thick coated dogs and said that he cannot get the <em>Frontline Plus</em> drops delivered to the hair follicles at the base of the skin by the shoulder blades.</p>
<p>So instead, he put the drops on their chest near the stomach and wondered how it would be distributed.</p>
<p>He was fortunate that the dogs did not lick it off but wondered if it was okay to apply it near the stomach or belly of a pet.</p>
<p>So, my response to this first part of the question is this—<strong>do not take a risk of applying your <em>flea treatment</em> product to pets except as directed</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are having issues with application—get some help from a groomer or a veterinarian.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never met a dog with a coat so thick that application was impossible.</p>
<p>You could use some clips to hold the dog hair to the side to apply it or even clip a small are shorter if you want to use the spot-on products.</p>
<p>The big issue with not following the instructions of spot-on products is that many animals have experienced illness or death from improper application.</p>
<p>In multiple animal households, you also must monitor the pets to make sure that they do not ingest the product by licking one another.</p>
<p>(I would encourage you to check out the flea control kits in the sidebar as less toxic options.)</p>
<h2>Excerpt from Flea Control Secrets eBook:</h2>
<p><em><strong>Frontline® Plus </strong></em><em>combines an antiparasitic agent with an insect growth regulator in a topical formula that kills the eggs, larva, adult fleas, chewing lice, and all stages of ticks.</em></p>
<p><em>Merial’s Frontline Plus® combines both Fipronil and Methoprene.</em></p>
<p><strong>Frontline® (Fipronil) </strong>kills fleas AND ticks for up to a month and affects the spinal cord and brain of the ecto-parasites.</p>
<p>Topical application is done on the skin between the pet’s shoulder blades so it wicks back over the pet’s body.</p>
<p><em>Fipronil remains effective after swimming and bathing. Even so, water immersion should be avoided until 48 hours after application. </em></p>
<p>The next challenge of his issue is the outdoor flea problem since there are feral animals (squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, birds) that enter the large property which is fenced in.</p>
<p>Flea season runs from April through October or until the temperatures drop (along with the humidity) so ongoing efforts need to be maintained.</p>
<p>At the moment the household is using <a href="/spectracide-granules">Spectracide granules</a> and then waited two months before doing a second application. This time the product used was <a href="/ortho-granules">Ortho granules</a> but the time lag in between works against you.</p>
<p>The issue this household faces is that when you begin flea control efforts, you must be diligent in those efforts and treat the outside, inside, and the animal all at the same time.</p>
<p>Also, fleas are very hardy insects so make sure the products being used work specifically for fleas.</p>
<p>Personally, for outdoor products I prefer to use natural, less toxic methods that are more environmentally friendly. You can also use a <a href="http://budurl.com/ScottYardSprayer">yard sprayer</a> to help with better dispersement.</p>
<p>Remember to also adapt your efforts to reflect the natural flea cycle. So this means treating the outside areas more frequently and making sure bedding and interior areas are also treated at the same time would be ideal.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll need to treat more frequently than has been done&#8211;daily vacuuming and more frequently application of flea treatment products (for the interior and exterior areas)&#8211;every two weeks for eight weeks at least.</p>
<p>I was glad to hear that the family is going to be using <a href="http://budurl.com/DiatomoceousEarth">diatomaceous earth </a>and <a href="http://budurl.com/FleaControlNematodes">nematodes</a> but again, make sure that you cycle the treatment at least every two weeks for the time being.</p>
<p>There are deterrents that can be used to discourage the entrance of feral animals but the consistency of treatment should work without investing in animal deterrents.</p>
<p>Recently, the pet owner purchased Capstar tablets and gave it to two of the three dogs.</p>
<p>This is a great option and many people use it in conjunction with a topic flea control but don&#8217;t combine it with another oral product unless specifically directed to do so by your veterinarian.</p>
<h2>Excerpt from Flea Control Secrets eBook:</h2>
<p><em><strong>Capstar® (Nitenpyram)</strong> is an oral treatment that kills adult fleas by interfering with nerve transmission in the flea.</em></p>
<p><em>Studies reported more than 90% effectiveness against adult fleas within four to six hours depending on the species.</em></p>
<p><em>Unfortunately Capstar® does not kill immature fleas, larvae, or eggs so it is necessary to combine its use with an Insect Growth Regulator.</em></p>
<p>It is also possible to use less toxic food grade ditomaceous dust on the pets—although it can be a bit drying.</p>
<p>Although much of the flea control products can be purchased without going to a veterinarian, I would encourage a veterinary visit for confirmation on the choices being made AND because the animals are likely to have internal parasites as a result of a flea infestation.</p>
<p>I am glad you have watched the videos and are doing all you can do to solve the flea infestation issue.</p>
<p>Remember, once you get a flea infestation it is important to remain diligent in your efforts to get it under control and manage it.</p>
<p>Since you did not mention interior treatments so I&#8217;d suggest <a href="http://budurl.com/FleabustersRX">Flea Busters RX</a> and also trying some <a href="http://budurl.com/ParasiteDust">Parasite Dust</a>.</p>
<p>I would also recommend reviewing the <em>Flea Control Secrets </em>videos on <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/seven-flea-control-strategies-video/">Seven Flea Control Strategies </a>and the <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/triangle-of-successful-flea-control-video/">Triangle of Successful Flea Control </a>and if you have not purchased the <em><a href="http://www.fleacontrolsecrets.com/learn-how-to-get-rid-of-fleas.html">Flea Control Secrets eBook</a></em>&#8211;you&#8217;ll find a whole lot more information to help you get rid of fleas.</p>
<p>Thanks for your question and let me know how it goes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you ever worry about organic pest control or natural flea control, you&#8217;ll be interested in this bit of news. Although it does not specifically have to do with flea treatment for dogs or flea treatment for cats&#8211;it does show an important trend.</p>
<p>Commercial product manufacturers would do well to pay attention to the latest green pet trend and adopt some different (and safer) models of pest control.</p>
<p><em>A study by researchers from Washington State University (WSU) and the University of Georgia suggests that a balanced mix of insects and fungi in organic fields provides for both better pest control and larger plants than in conventional agriculture. The study, which was funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) and published in the July 1 edition of the journal Nature, shows that organic farming practices lead to many equally-common beneficial species, and that this reduces pest problems.</p>
<p>“It’s always been a mystery how organic farmers get high yields without using synthetic insecticides,” says co-author Bill Snyder, Ph.D., associate professor of entomology at WSU. “Our study suggests that biodiversity conservation may be a key to their success.”</p>
<p>The study involved 42 potato plots enclosed in fine mesh on the Pullman campus of WSU. The researchers planted both potato plants and Colorado potato beetles (a very problematic pest of the potato) in each of the plots, adding varying numbers of beneficial insects, fungi and nematodes, microscopic soil-dwelling worms that attack beetles’ eggs and larvae.</p>
<p>Crops placed in the organic test plots with a more balanced insect population grew faster, because no one species of insect had a chance to dominate the plot and kill the potato plants. In fact, the study found that the increased evenness of species in the organic plots compared to the conventional plots led to 18% lower pest densities and 35% larger plants. Larger plants generally translate to greater potato yields, suggesting that organic methods might provide higher profits as well as an ecological sustainability advantage.</p>
<p>Though previous conservation and biodiversity studies tended to focus on species richness, or the number of individual species present in an area, this study is one of the few to consider the advantage of relatively equal numbers, or “evenness” of species for a beneficial agricultural ecosystem. Thus, the results show that both richness and evenness must be maintained to ensure a healthy environment. Conventional agricultural methods, which rely heavily on spraying pesticides, tend to wipe out the majority of insects, leaving behind a few hardy species that end up dominating the conventional field ecosystem. These findings promote the reliance on a mix of natural predators as a way to avoid the “pesticide treadmill” that forces farmers to use larger and larger volumes of different costly chemicals to kill hardy pests that develop resistance.</p>
<p>Research director Andrew Jensen from The Washington State Potato Commission, which partially funded Dr. Snyder’s research, says they hope to translate the study into practical advice their members can use. Washington is second (after Idaho) in potato production in the U.S., but less than 1% of the state’s potatoes are organically grown. Studies like these might convince potato growers to cut back on spraying and eventually switch to organic methods, which would suit top potato customers, like McDonalds and Wendy’s, who are being pushed to green up their practices.</p>
<p>“People who buy a lot of potatoes are asking the growers to reduce insecticide use as much as possible, to document pesticide use, and include biological control as a consideration,” remarked Dr. Snyder in a comment to the Seattle Times.</p>
<p>This study adds to the body of scientific literature considering the benefits of organic agriculture, which includes a paper published by the Rodale Institute in 2003, describing how an organic system produces better yields of corn and soybeans under severe drought conditions and gives better environmental stability under flood conditions through lower runoff risks and greater water retention capabilities in the soil. This helps to balance inaccurate, industry-funded studies which only confuse consumers.</em></p>
<p>Prior to major commercialization we did use better methods of pest control and this trend is better for the environment and everyone in it. </p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised to see major changes in a lot of the pesticide use as people begin to understand just how bad they are for humans and animals.</p>
<p>Recently I learned of the pest control that occurs without application to the human skin (mosquitoes) and was thrilled. </p>
<p>Take a look at the flea control kits in the sidebar and once you visit the site be sure to also look for the pest tag for pets&#8211;great options for your pets.</p>

Lufenuron dosage is based on your pet’s weight and species.</p>
<p>It is critical to avoid giving a dog product to a cat and a cat product to a dog. If you haven&#8217;t heard about the many issues under investigation by the EPA&#8211;part of the problem is thought to be the misuse of products by pet owners by applying flea control products to the wrong species or overdosing due to inaccurate weight estimation. (Best to err on the side of caution.)</p>
<p>The Program flea medication is given once a month.</p>
<p>Lufenuron is administered orally for dogs but cats can receive a pill, liquid suspension, or injection.  Program sterilizes the females and so interrupts the flea life cycle.</p>
<p>Eggs cease to hatch within seven days after this product is ingested but adult flea bites can still cause irritation and other complications.</p>
<p>Until the effects take effect, additional flea control methods need to be implemented to reduce the existing flea population.</p>

<p>Program and most of the best home flea remedies and flea control medications are outlined in<em> Flea Control Secrets.</em></p>

<p>Ya think?</p>
<p>I wrote about this in the eBook <a href="http://www.fleacontrolsecrets.com/learn-how-to-get-rid-of-fleas.html" target="_blank">Flea Control Secrets</a> and <a href=" http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/epa-flea-advisory-update-imminent/" target="_blank">anticipated the results last fall</a> at the latest.</p>
<p>Today it was announced that there will be an <a href="http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/eeffe922a687433c85257359003f5340/cb98fe802d1162a78525759a00686ef0!OpenDocument" target="_blank">increased scrutiny of flea treatment products</a>, specifically spot-on treatments.</p>
<p>The spot-on flea treatment product investigation results were introduced on March 17, 2010 when the <a href="http://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=lobby.jsp&amp;eventid=200036&amp;sessionid=1&amp;key=A23CD91009359700B90DE20E5F49AAFB&amp;eventuserid=34253241" target="_blank">EPA conducted an online flea treatment webinar</a> to discuss their findings from the investigation that I mentioned last year—and have been waiting for.</p>
<p>The investigation was sparked by reports of injury and deaths occurring from over the counter flea and tick products.</p>
<p>The agency is inviting public comment about how to implement their new measures. You can view the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-03-18/html/2010-5957.htm" target="_blank">Federal Register notice </a>announcing the opening of docket number EPA-HQ-OPP-2010-0229.</p>
<blockquote><p>Take a moment to <a href="http://cfpub.epa.gov/pesticides/comments.cfm" target="_blank">voice your concerns and opinions now</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) and Canada’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency (PMRA) collaborated on this study.</p>
<p>The results found dermal, gastrointestinal and neurological reactions were the most commonly reported complications.</p>
<p>What disturbed me was that the initial posting (listed in Flea Control Secrets) was removed from the EPA website.</p>
<p>Was it pressure from manufacturers of these products?</p>
<p>In addition to looking at the REPORTED incidents involving cats and dogs, and at both the active and inert ingredients, and finally evaluated product labeling.</p>
<p>Some of the problems involved inconsistent reports on adverse reactions and information reported by pet owners.</p>
<p>Also, incidents that weren’t included in the EPA’s evaluation were those from products without EPA registration numbers, those that were vague, and those that were not able to be identified as a specific pesticides or drugs because a combination meant that a reaction couldn’t be definitively tied to a specific product.</p>
<p>In addition, incidents that involving multiple animals were not included because many of these could not be accurately identified.</p>
<p>So, in the great, vague, non-committal way the government seems to be operating these days, the EPA stated that their evaluation indicated that additional restrictions should be applied to these products.</p>
<p>Uh, we knew that already.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the public comment period is vital since, there are a variety of ideas they will implement—such as different packaging, clearer warnings, etc.</p>
<p>It is not clear if restrictions will apply to over-the-counter products, prescription products or both.</p>
<p>Findings included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small breed dogs were affected more often than medium and large breed dogs.</li>
<li>Dogs affected over three years of age were significant.</li>
<li>Younger cats affected were significant.</li>
<li>Products containing cyphenothrin and permethrin stood out.</li>
<li>Dosage ranges are currently too broad and may need refinement.</li>
</ul>
<p>I find it interesting that blame is being passed on to the consumer once again since the EPA emphasized the importance of following the manufacturer’s directions carefully, suggesting that misapplication may have be a major contributor to incidents, and that the misuse of dog products on cats or splitting a tube between animals was a concern.</p>
<p>Unrevealed information includes inert ingredients (unlisted and often proprietary additives) which are indicated as an important factor in adverse reactions.</p>
<p>You can find a list of the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/health/petproductsders.html" target="_blank">flea treatment product/manufacturer by number</a> here.</p>
<p>The analysis was done with percentages to omit any bias based on sales and differences in product popularity and use differences.</p>
<p>Meaning, that a popular product may show more incidents versus a less popular product.</p>
<p>How do you feel about that?</p>
<p>Many people want to see all the numbers of incidents, ingredients, etc.</p>
<p>However, the EPA noted that deaths and adverse incidents were reported for <em>all </em>the products included in the study.</p>
<p><strong>Flea Treatment Safety Steps YOU Can Take</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Consult your veterinarian before using any product.</li>
<li>Do not purchase flea treatment products from suspect suppliers (such as online) as <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-medication/counterfeit-flea-treatment-dangers/" target="_blank">counterfeit flea treatment </a>is a problem.</li>
<li>Read the manufacturer’s instructions and entire label (follow the directions as detailed).</li>
<li>Pay attention to warnings and use caution on weak, elderly, sick, pregnant, or nursing pets.</li>
<li>Follow age restrictions.</li>
<li>Weigh your pet before application and follow weight restrictions on package&#8211;and err on the low side.</li>
<li>Follow species specific practices. Only use a dog product on a dog and a cat product on a cat.</li>
<li>Keep the package and record the dates and times you treat your pet. Lot numbers and product data is vital if your pet has an adverse reaction.</li>
<li>Use a flea treatment product on a pet when you are going to be present so you can watch your pet and identify an adverse reaction quickly if it happens.</li>
<li>Call your veterinarian immediately if your pet has symptoms of an adverse reaction.</li>
<li>You can also call an emergency clinic or the <a href="http://www.napcc.aspca.org/pet-care/poison-control/" target="_blank">Animal Poison Control Center at (888) 426-4435</a>.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/5-epa.jpg" alt="" width="124" height="135" />WASHINGTON — The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is requesting public comment on options for disclosing inert ingredients in pesticides. In this anticipated rule making, EPA is seeking ideas for greater disclosure of inert ingredient identities. Inert ingredients are part of the end use product formulation and are not active ingredients. Revealing inert ingredients will help consumers make informed decisions and will better protect public health and the environment.</p>
<p>“Consumers deserve to know the identities of ingredients in pesticide formulations, including inert ingredients,” said Steve Owens, assistant administrator for EPA’s Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances. “Disclosing inert ingredients in pesticide products, especially those considered to be hazardous, will empower consumers and pesticide users to make more informed choices.”</p>
<p>EPA believes public disclosure is one way to discourage the use of hazardous inert ingredients in pesticide formulations. The agency is inviting comment on various regulatory and voluntary steps to achieve this broader disclosure.</p>
<p>Pesticide manufacturers usually disclose their inert ingredients only to EPA. Currently, EPA evaluates the safety of all ingredients in a product’s formulation when determining whether the pesticide should be registered.</p>
<p>On October 1, 2009, EPA responded to two petitions (one by Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides, and a second by several state attorneys general), that designated more than 350 inert pesticide ingredients as hazardous. The petitioners asked EPA to require that these ingredients be identified on the labels of products that include them in their formulations.</p>
<p>EPA will accept comments on the advance notice of proposed rulemaking for 60 days after it has been published in the Federal Register.</p>

<p>I have not found the source for this trained flea video (ad for Playstation) but since I am into animal behavior I thought it was interesting. Not sure if it is true but it captured my curiosity.</p>
<p>Fleas can live long periods without feeding but passing the conditioning on to the next generation brings lots of questions to mind. If you know someone who has the answers&#8211;send them this way.</p>
<ul>
<li>How old were the fleas when they were placed in the jar?</li>
<li>What species of flea are in the jar?</li>
<li>Who conducted the experiment and why?</li>
<li>How many generations of fleas did they look at?</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/flea-rinses-dips-cat-in-tub.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="310" />Earlier this week I shared a video on cat flea treatment by bathing your cat but there are a few other tips I thought might be useful.</p>
<p>One of the common mistakes people make is to think that their pet needs a bath every day or every week. This is not true and be irritating and drying.</p>
<p>Cats will self-groom, and many will bath each other, but older cats and kittens cannot often deal with flea infestations. If there is a flea infestation you might bath once a week for two weeks or so but normally felines don&#8217;t need to be bathed every week.</p>
<p>Once you have the flea infestation under control you can bath your cat once a month or so if you want. Many grooming salons also offer cat services. Ideally use one that specializes in felines since too many barking or whining dogs might stress your critter out.</p>
<p>If you are not taking your cat to a specialist, take the time to trim your pet&#8217;s claws first since cat nail trimming helps reduce scratches during the bath.</p>
<p><strong>Cat Flea Bath Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use the bathtub but I prefer the kitchen sink for ease of handling the cat.</li>
<li>Provide a grip mat so the animal doesn&#8217;t slip and has something for footing&#8211;unless your cat is more cooperative without leverage!</li>
<li>Use a spray nozzle to help you (plus they dislodge fleas).</li>
<li>Collect all your bathing tools and place them within arms reach (shampoo, towels, bath mat, brush, comb, crate).</li>
<li>Warm the room so your feline stays warm. This is especially important when bathing kittens or senior cats.</li>
<li>Test the water to make sure it is warm and not too hot or cold for your feline.</li>
<li>Wear an apron, and if you think your cat is going to protest, heavier garments.</li>
<li>Suds quickly and be careful to keep suds out of the pets eyes and ears.</li>
<li>Massage for 10-15 minutes and use the nozzle to dislodge fleas when you rinse.</li>
<li>Rinse completely.</li>
<li>Towel dry and keep the cat in a warm room immediately after the bath.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, a flea treatment bath is only part of the process. To eliminate fleas you must treat the home, yard, and animal at the same time using the triangle of successful flea contol and the strategies outlined in <em>Flea Control Secrets. </em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve talked about identifying a flea infestation on a pet before but here is a video that shows you how to look and then how to use a flea comb to identify your pet has fleas.</p>
<p>Most fleas can be seen on the lower belly, near the undersides of the thighs, and at the base of the tail. </p>
<p>If you move the fur (as seen on the video) you can often see the fleas move away and catch glimpses of flea dirt (flea poop and debris) in the coat or on pet bedding. </p>

<p>People often ask how they can tell if their animal has fleas&#8211;which surprises me since anyone who pays attention to their animal should be alert to some of the warning signs.</p>
<p>Some signs of a flea infestation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>excessive scratching,</li>
<li>black insects crawling on pet,</li>
<li>presence of flea dirt on animal and animal bedding, and</li>
<li>increased chewing and licking.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this video the animal is severely infested with fleas and is being cleaned by a grooming professional. The reddish brown water is actually flea dirt.</p>
<p>Flea dirt is the poop of fleas and what flea larvae feed on. The amount of fleas are only some of of the entire problem. The home and yard should be treated since the other 95% of flea populations are made up of flea eggs, flea larvae, and flea pupae&#8211;only 5% of any infestation are adult fleas.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also get the animal into the vet for an exam to rule out flea bite anemia and for deworming.</p>
<p>The point to all this is to encourage people to not wait to implement flea control to avoid a bigger problem and complications&#8211;and the additional expense of professional grooming and veterinary care&#8211;not to mention the health risks to pets from flea infestations.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/flea-life-cycle-5-typical-flea-popu.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="174" />There has been much speculation as to whether or not fleas are becoming immune to flea treatments on the market.</p>
<p>Just whether or not flea treatment resistence is a reality has not been widely studied. In fact, I blogged about the <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/study-reveals-imidacloprid-highly-effective/" target="_blank">Bayer Animal Health-funded Flea Susceptibility Monitoring program </a>being the first and only companion animal parasite study about flea immunity.</p>
<p>However, any animal professional worth their salt questions studies funded by groups who produce the products. Why? Sales would benefit from any results that showed that no resistance to those products.</p>
<p>Even when &#8220;internationally renowned, independent researchers&#8221; are conducting the studies it still flags common sense questions.</p>
<p>So, out in the real world people are questioning whether or not fleas are developing resistance to flea treatments.</p>
<p>There are reasons behind the theory.</p>
<p>First, is that many flea treatments are reported to need application sooner than suggested on the packaging.</p>
<p>Some professionals are even recommending an oral flea treatment as a supplement to topical, spot-on flea treatments.</p>
<p>Now, there is a problem with <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/how-to-avoid-counterfeit-flea-treatment-products/" target="_blank">counterfeit flea treatment products</a>, which could account for some of these reports.</p>
<p>Then there is global climate change that is making the environment more supportive of flea populations&#8211;which may mean that there are more fleas to combat.</p>
<p>Unless we have some other definitive studies by outside groups not funded by companies that might benefit from the findings, subjective opinions may over shadow the only study on flea immunity on record.</p>
<p>If you want to read some interesting theories about flea immunity in the pest control industry, this well researched article on <a href="http://www.suffolkpestcontrol.net/fleas_on_the_rebound.asp" target="_blank">flea immunity theory</a> will be of interest.</p>
<p>Back in 2004, <em>Pesticide Biochemistry and Physiology</em> (Volume 79, Issue 1, May 2004, pages 25-30) published an article on<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6WP8-4C0V5NM-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=991828644&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0d8d80bd8dcfe465e2f87df942b8a034" target="_blank"> insecticide resistance in the cat flea</a>.</p>

<p>In this pest control video Mark Govan discusses how to use Borax in the home but fails to discuss pet dangers which I wrote about in the first post in this series.</p>
<p>Obviously, borax powder can be used for flea control and is a better alternative than some chemicals. BUT I think <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/where-do-you-buy-diatomaceous-earth-for-flea-control/" target="_blank">diatomaceous earth</a> is safer. Once you put the borax powder down, it must be vacuumed up after a few days.</p>
<p>Borax IS a desiccant (drying agent) and if pet&#8217;s ingest it through licking their paws or floor it could present problems as I discussed in the first post in this series.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/20-mule-team-not-for-fleas.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="247" />Borate, Boric Acid, and Boron cause confusion. Borax (Na2B4O7-10H2O) and Boric Acid (H3BO3) are made from the natural occurring element, <a href="http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/boron.htm#Intr" target="_blank">Boron</a>.</p>
<p>Although the home flea remedy use of <a href="http://www.20muleteamlaundry.com/" target="_blank">20 Mule Team Borax</a> and Boric Acid are often found around the internet, it does not mean that these products are non-toxic to pets.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, <strong>natural does not mean non-toxic </strong>and I found a good description of the <a href="http://shalompest.homestead.com/Common_pesticide_toxicities.pdf" target="_blank">differences in the terms used for pesticide toxicities </a>(such organic and natural) which is worth checking out.</p>
<p>Perhaps Americans continue to recommend boron products since most of the world’s borates come from the United States.</p>
<p>In 1872 FM Smith discovered borates in the Nevada desert and it wasn&#8217;t long (1883) before the 20 mule teams began hauling those minerals out of Death Valley and surrounding areas.</p>
<p>Borax is abrasive and so can damage or fade surfaces but it is important to note that although borates are considered to be low toxicity, it does not mean they are not toxic.</p>
<p>The danger to pets is that borates can become concentrated in the kidneys and kidney damage can result.</p>
<blockquote><p>Dial Corporation, the manufacturer of the <em>20 Mule Team Borax</em> product has stated, “<em>This product has not been tested nor received approval from the EPA for use as a pesticide.”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Toxic dosages have not been determined for dogs and cats but the concern comes from the risk of ingestion through the cleaning of paws or fur.</p>
<p>A risk to pets exists if you use boron products for flea control in carpets, on flooring, or in similar applications.</p>
<p>Borate toxicity symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li> drooling,</li>
<li>vomiting,</li>
<li>abdominal pain,</li>
<li>diarrhea,</li>
<li>depression,</li>
<li>ataxia,</li>
<li>hyperesthesia,</li>
<li>muscle weakness,</li>
<li>tremors,</li>
<li>seizures,</li>
<li>blood in the urine,</li>
<li>decreased urine production,</li>
<li>coma,</li>
<li>and death.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seek veterinary care immediately if you suspect that your pet has ingested the substance.</p>
<p>So, it is worth the trouble to use Borax or Boric Acid for flea control?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d use the less toxic <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/where-do-you-buy-diatomaceous-earth-for-flea-control/" target="_blank">diatomaceous earth (DE)</a> instead but here are some other resources you might want to check out.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Garlic flea treatment" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/22897538@N04/3785726673/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3449/3785726673_6f0b379d30.jpg" border="0" alt="Garlic flea treatment" width="375" height="500" /></a>People are always asking if they can give garlic to pets to help get rid of fleas.</p>
<p>Once again, people give out bad advice and say, yes.</p>
<p>No, NO, NO!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t give garlic to pets for flea treatment.</p>
<p>First, <strong>garlic has not been proven to help fight fleas.</strong></p>
<p>Second, according to the <a href="http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/poison-control/plants/garlic.html" target="_blank">ASPCA Pet Poison Hotline&#8211;<strong>garlic is toxic to pets</strong></a>!</p>
<p>Now if you look around the Internet it is easy to find people who swear that it works.</p>
<p>There are also companies that add garlic to brewers yeast&#8211;but none of those anecdotes have been proven effective.</p>
<p>Is it worth these <strong>risks if you use garlic for flea control</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Vomiting,</li>
<li>breakdown of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia, Heinz body anemia),</li>
<li>blood in urine,</li>
<li>weakness,</li>
<li>high heart rate,</li>
<li>and excessive panting.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>Garlic can cause gastrointestinal irritation that might result in red blood cell damage.</p>
<p>Cats are more sensitive while dogs need significantly more to react adversely.</p>
<p>The problem that concerns me is that I have not found anything about the long-term damage that can result from low doses given over time of this toxic substance.</p>
<p>I have to ask you, Is it worth your pet&#8217;s health?</p>
<p>There are those that will say that garlic has been used for eons without issue&#8211;but you can&#8217;t convince me to use a toxic compound that has not been proven to work (or to be safe) when there are other natural options out there that are not toxic to pets.</p>
<p>Why would you?</p>
<p>Garlic toxicity can also only be diagnosed over time, through clinical symptoms and with confirmation of Heinz bodies.</p>
<p>How many people are doing that?</p>
<p>So although an occasional sprinkle found in pet foods or pet treats might not cause problems, most professionals do NOT recommend giving pets garlic or food containing hefty amounts of garlic.</p>
<p>Try some of the other options discussed in the ebook or even Brewer&#8217;s Yeast tablets without garlic.</p>
<p>Also, adding apple cider vinegar to pet water or applying it as a topical spray (50% water) instead will help fight fleas on pets.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of our readers asked, &#8220;Do fleas live in water?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphnia">Daphnia </a>are commonly called water fleas although they are not fleas from the family Siphonaptera&#8211;which are the ones you are probably asking about.</p>
<p>Fleas have a waterproof waxy coating that is often called an epi-cutical layer. This waterproofing is why fleas survive and escape watery deaths.</p>
<p>To prevent escape people add a small drop of dish detergent to any solution place under a flea trap. The solution breaks down the protective coating and the fleas drown.</p>
<p>This is also why, if you use flea combs on your pet, the right way to clear them from the comb is to dump them into a light sudsy water solution. </p>
<p>People also will use a small amount of dish soap in a yard sprayer to help drown any fleas in the yard. </p>
<p>So, although fleas don&#8217;t actually live in water as their habitat, fleas can survive being dumped in water prior to their escape unless you take the precaution of adding a little suds to the water. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A poodle stuck in its crate last week had a visit to the vet who traced the problem to the pet’s spot-on flea treatment.</p>
<p>Residue from the product <em>Advantage</em>, applied between the poodle’s shoulders, dissolved the plastic and caused it to adhere to the dog’s belly.</p>
<p>When the dog wouldn’t come out of its crate the next morning, its concerned owner brought the dog, crate and all, to Dr. Tej Dhaliwal of North Town Veterinary Hospital in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>Dhaliwal concluded that <em><strong>benzyl alcohol</strong>, an inactive ingredient in Advantage, was to blame</em>.</p>
<p>Bayer Animal Health, maker of Advantage, acknowledged that the flea treatment was the likely culprit and offered to pay the owner’s veterinary bill, compensate him for loss of salary and replace the crate, Dhaliwal said.</p>
<p>Read the whole article at the <a href="http://news.vin.com/VINNews.aspx?articleId=14061#">Veterinary Information Network News</a> but check this out:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Dale Kemery, a spokesman for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which regulates pesticides including spot-on pet parasiticides, said the agency is considering a new rule to require that manufacturers disclose pesticides’ inert ingredients.</p>
<p>“This increased transparency will assist consumers and users of pesticides in making informed decisions and will better protect public health and the environment,” Kemery said by e-mail. “The Agency anticipates publishing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the Federal Register within the next few months.”</p>
<p>Kemery also encouraged anyone aware of adverse reactions with an EPA-registered product to report the matter to the manufacturer and directly to EPA. </p>
<p>“Manufacturers of pesticide products are required to report to EPA information they receive about potential adverse effects of their products, but reporting to the EPA directly is beneficial because the data we receive from the manufacturers is aggregated by severity category, and the report of an individual incident that we receive directly may provide more details initially that could lead to a follow-up by EPA with the manufacturer,” Kemery said.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, we are still waiting on the EPA to release their findings in the flea product spot-on after this year&#8217;s advisories and meetings with flea product manufacturers.</p>
<p>Just a reminder, commercial flea products are pesticides&#8211;chemicals that have some pretty scary warnings on the labels. If you haven&#8217;t purchased <em>Flea Control Secrets </em>yet, be sure to at least subscribe to the ecourse using the form to your right.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Entlebucher bei Mamma" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38269304@N05/3606593740/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none;" title="Creative Commons License photo credit: sennenhunde.at" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2134/3606593740_72f7e3b04c_m.jpg" border="0" alt="dog with puppies flea treatment " width="240" height="199" /></a>Lately I&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of people asking about whether or not flea treatment can be safely used on dogs with puppies.</p>
<p>The safest answer is: <strong>Do NOT use commercial flea treatment on your pet if it is nursing puppies and do NOT use flea control products on the puppies. </strong></p>
<p>Most pesticides are not safe for use on puppies less than eight weeks of age and so you should avoid treating the mother while she is nursing unless your veterinarian has told you specifically to do so.</p>
<p>However, you can use a few strategies prior to whelping and during the time those pups are growing.</p>
<p>First, ask your veterinarian if and when you need to stop using topic flea treatment on your pet before she whelps.</p>
<p>Your vet will be able to make specific recommendations for you that will help pets stay safe and flea free.</p>
<p>Since you have a couple of months to prepare, begin flea treatment when you suspect your pet is pregnant or if you know you are going to breed your pet. Doing this gives you time to use topical flea treatment and other strategies without worry.</p>
<p>Also, if you treat the home, exterior areas, and the pet at the same time, you will have the fleas under control prior to the birth of any puppies.</p>
<p>It takes about eight weeks to totally get rid of fleas using the <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/triangle-of-successful-flea-control-video/" target="_blank">triangle of successful flea control</a>.</p>
<p>Other flea control tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-toxic diatomaceous earth (DE) can be spread in the carpets and flooring&#8211;vacuum up after three to five days.</li>
<li>Use DE on your pet as a flea dust&#8211;just apply in a well ventilated area. (Learn more about<a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/natural-flea-remedy-diatomaceous-earth-video/" target="_blank"> diatomaceous earth for flea control</a>.)</li>
<li>In addition, try parasitic nematodes in the yard. They prey on fleas at different stages of their development. Add more every three weeks.</li>
<li>Daily cleaning is a must when using any flea control methods. Dust, vacuum, and mop.</li>
<li>Try using a sheet over pet bedding and change out daily.</li>
<li>Wash pet bedding and sheets in hot water with lavender or other flea fighting oils (rosemary, thyme, cedarwood) as this will help repel fleas further.</li>
<li>Since many essential oils can be toxic to pets just use in the laundry.</li>
<li>Cedarwood chips inside pet beds and in the garden will repel fleas.</li>
<li>Flea combs work great for dogs and puppies. Comb daily to remove fleas and flea dirt.</li>
<li>Bathing a pup in mild baby shampoo or using a water dip helps&#8211;just make sure to dry the pups and prevent them from chilling.</li>
</ul>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><img class="alignright" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/flea-collar-reaction.jpg" alt="flea collar toxicity and flea collar injury on cat" width="170" height="231" /></strong>Every day people seek guidance on flea treatment options and many get bad advice that can be downright deadly to their pet.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the best flea treatment for your dog or cat is the one that works and that fits your budget AND is non-toxic to your household.</p>
<p>People still have odd ideas about the best flea control products so if you have not purchased <em>Flea Control Secrets</em>, here is a list of different options to consider when seeking the best flea treatment for your animal.</p>
<p><strong>Flea Collars </strong></p>
<p>Contrary to popular beliefs, <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/flea-control-mistakes-flea-collars/" target="_blank">flea collars</a> can help repel fleas but are not recommended as flea killers&#8211;and they can be downright toxic.</p>
<p>Most pet owners today use herbal collars as repellents instead of the commercial toxic products first developed by Robert Goulding Jr., an entomologist whose research into time-release pesticides led to the introduction and popularization of the flea collar in 1964.</p>
<p>Consumer Reports covered this method some time ago and found them to be ineffective. Recent concerns reveal toxicity issues for children and the households with animals wearing them&#8211;not to mention the issues for the animals themselves.</p>
<p>Flea collars concentrate flea treatment around a pet&#8217;s neck and head. There have been a variety of reports of injury to animals wearing commercial flea collars that include burns to the neck (and other areas that the collar has touched&#8211;such as paws). Other reactions such as seizures are also issues. You can read the story of <a href="http://www.hartzvictims.org/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=691" target="_blank">TJ the cat</a> and see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/joshjanicek/sets/72157600524291017/" target="_blank">flea collar injury photos </a>here.</p>
<p><strong>Topical Flea Treatment (aka Spot-On Flea Treatments) </strong></p>
<p>Topical flea treatments (known as spot-on flea treatments) are currently the most popular flea control because they are easy for the owner. Topical flea control is simply applied once a month on the pet&#8217;s shoulders and protects a pet for about a month.</p>
<p>The EPA launched an investigation into spot-on flea control products in April of 2009 after an increase in reported severe reactions and deaths of pets from these topical products. An update on this issue is expected in October of 2009.</p>
<p>Three of the most popular flea control spot-on products include Frontline, Revolution and Advantage. The best source for topical flea control products is your veterinarian since reactions to over the counter (OTC) products are an issue and counterfeit flea products are suspected to be contributors to the rise in flea control product reactions.</p>
<p><strong>Oral Flea Control</strong></p>
<p>Oral flea treatment products are used in conjunction with other flea control methods and usually are given in pill or liquid  form. The adult fleas ingesting the chemicals in a pet&#8217;s system lay infertile eggs and so stop the cycle but do not kill adult fleas. The most popular product currently on the market is called Capstar.</p>
<p><strong>Flea Shampoos</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, you do not need to use toxic flea shampoos on a pet since any pet shampoo will work to kill fleas if you leave the suds in for about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Ideally the shampoo will be an oatmeal pet shampoo in conditioner so that it also helps give the pet relief from itchy skin.</p>
<p>Dish soap (dish detergents) such as Dawn or Ivory are not recommended for use on pets for flea control since they are very harsh and very drying.</p>
<p><strong>Flea Dips </strong></p>
<p>Flea dips are potent, chemical rinses that are very toxic. Using any concentrated chemical should be a concern and this method has traditioinally been used only for the most severe cases and administered by a professional groomer or veterinary service.</p>
<p>Today there are also herbal dips on the market but water dips also can be very effective as we discussed in <em>Flea Control Secrets</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Flea Powders and Flea Sprays </strong></p>
<p>Flea powders and flea sprays are not as popular as they once were. Today most people avoid the toxic chemical flea powders or chemical flea sprays and select lesser toxic home flea remedies such as apple cider vinegar sprays or parasite dust using diatomaceous earth.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Flea Treatment </strong></p>
<p>Natural flea treatments are gaining popularity as alternatives for flea control. However, many people are not aware that &#8220;natural&#8221; does not always mean less toxic. Some natural herbs or essential oils can be toxic to pets so care must be used when selecting these flea control products.</p>
<p><strong>Professional Flea Services</strong></p>
<p>Professional flea control is often an overlooked option. Busy people appreciate the help and many of the better services will offer a service guarantee for a specific amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Flea Control Strategies that Work</strong></p>
<p>Treating the interior and exterior areas of your home along with the pet are critical pieces to getting rid of fleas. If you are unfamiliar with this concept, it was covered in the<a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/discover-the-triangle-of-successful-flea-control-video/" target="_blank"> triangle of successful flea control</a> video.</p>
<p>Simple, consistent steps to get rid of fleas include daily dusting, vacuuming, mopping, and cleaning of bedding as well as mowing the lawn and cutting back foliage are part of this effective strategy.</p>
<p>Using alternative methods for flea control such as parasitic nematode and other less toxic flea product methods work together to help you get rid of fleas and keep them away.</p>
<p><strong>How long will it take to get rid of fleas?</strong></p>
<p>Plan on daily action for several weeks. If you use the techniques and products recommended in the triangle of successful flea control&#8211;fleas should be gone within eight weeks and then it is simply a matter of maintenance.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/cat-spot-on-application-1.jpg" alt="" width="244" height="197" />Many people are unaware of cat flea treatment dangers from the improper application of spot-on flea products for felines.</p>
<p>There are a few flea product application cautionary tips every cat owner should know.</p>
<p>If you live in a multiple cat household, it is a good idea to<strong> keep your cats temporarily separated from each other</strong> during and after the application of a spot-on flea product.</p>
<p>Some cats will immediately begin grooming each other so it is best to keep the felines separated in different rooms until the application wicks through the skin and is not so concentrated in one area.</p>
<p>Also, many people mistakenly apply cat flea treatment between the shoulder blades on the animal. This is incorrect, the flea treatment application for cats should be <strong>up high under the fur on the neck at the base of the skull</strong>.</p>
<p>Spot-on cat flea treatments should also not be used on young kittens. Please see our<a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/kitten-flea-treatment/" target="_blank"> kitten flea treatment article</a> for help.</p>
<p>Finally, use caution with any flea treatment and <strong>do not get this product in your pet&#8217;s eyes or mouth</strong>.</p>
<p>Most cat flea treatment products are bitter tasting and salivation occurs if the cat licks the product immediately after treatment so by applying the cat flea treatment at the base of the skull, and by keeping other felines restrained in other locations away from each other for a time, pet owners can minimize the opportunity for the cat to lick the product.</p>
<p>Always be sure to weigh your cat to get the right product strength&#8211;and error on the side of caution when using any cat flea treatment product. Too much can be toxic to the animal.</p>
<p>Educate yourself on how to <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/flea-treatments-flea-remedies/how-to-avoid-counterfeit-flea-treatment-products/" target="_blank">avoid counterfeit flea control products</a>.</p>
<p>Finally NEVER use dog flea treatment on cats.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.dawn-dish.com/en_US/savingwildlife.do"><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/saving_wildlife_dawn.gif" alt="Dawn dish soap is NOT for flea control but is useful for removing oil and tar from animal fur or bird feathers" width="330" height="228" /></a>Dawn dish soap IS useful for removing oil from the fur and feathers of wildlife but is <strong>not</strong> recommended for use on pets for flea control.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Dish soap is harsh and does not support the skin PH of your pet. So while using any dish soap will work, why would you subject your pet to a harsher product than needed?</p>
<p>Using Dawn dish detergent (or any other brand of dish soap) will dry out your pet&#8217;s skin and coat.</p>
<p>The truth is that you can use a <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/episoothe" target="_blank">pet oatmeal shampoo and conditioner </a>to kill fleas and provide relief to the itchy skin of your pet.</p>
<p>The advantage is that a pet oatmeal shampoo and conditioner is formulated specifically for the PH of your pet and is non-toxic. It soothes the irritation.</p>
<p>In fact, to use oatmeal pet shampoo for successful flea control, just suds it in and leave it on for 15 minutes.</p>
<p>The way it works is by breaking down the external covering of the flea which normally protects the flea from drowning. When applied and left on, the waterproof covering breaks down&#8211;and the fleas drown.</p>
<p>So, the big secret is that you don&#8217;t actually need to use flea shampoo either AND you also don&#8217;t need to use a harsh product (like dish soap) on your pet to achieve the same results.</p>
<p>One of the reasons people are confused on this issue is because Dawn has long be used on wildlife victims of oil spills. Rescuers found that Dawn was a good option to remove the substance from oiled feathers and fur.</p>
<p>Proctor &amp; Gamble has actually been promoting a <a href="http://www.dawn-dish.com/en_US/savingwildlife.do" target="_blank">Dawn campaign that fund-raises for wildlife&#8211;</a>which people have taken to mean that it is okay to use on pets.</p>
<p>I asked P&amp;G about people using Dawn for flea control and the reply was, &#8220;<em>We have not tested the Dawn product on the removal of fleas. We know many consumers use our products for different purposes. However, we have not done the technical testing to prove this is safe or effective</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>So there is the answer and just remember that most savvy pet professionals recommend a <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/episoothe" target="_blank">pet oatmeal shampoo and conditioner</a> for gentle and effective pet flea control issues.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>How long does it take to get rid of fleas? </strong>This is one of the most asked questions when it comes to flea control.</p>
<p>It takes about eight weeks to get rid of fleas if you are using the triangle of successful flea control.</p>
<p>If you are using flea products to treat the yard, home, and animal then you are doing pretty much all you need to do.</p>
<p>Be sure to always repeat your efforts about every three weeks.</p>
<p>Once you get the flea infestation under control you will want to continue to use flea treatment on a regular basis this could be once a month or every two months.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/Pesticide-Warningred.jpg" alt="" width="125" height="139" />Counterfeit flea treatment products are suspected to be contributing to the adverse reactions being reported by pet owners after using flea treatment products.</p>
<p>In the first post in this series I listed the most commonly counterfeited products along with their registration numbers.</p>
<p>But the question on most people&#8217;s minds is, <em>Just how do you identify a fake flea treatment product?</em></p>
<p>Foreign sources are the main suppliers of these flea control products that could endanger, or even kill, your pet(s).</p>
<p>Here is a short list of tips to avoid (or identify) counterfeit flea treatment products:</p>
<p>1. Don&#8217;t purchase flea products from foreign suppliers.<br />
2. Be suspicious of any flea control products that are missing the inserts with directions for the safe use of the product.<br />
3. Beware of flea treatment products that are not sold in child proof packaging.<br />
4. Check to see that the lot number of the insert and applicator(s) match the lot number on the outside of the package.<br />
5. Make sure all the label information matched the requirements of the EPA.<br />
6. Avoid cheap flea products sold on the Internet.<br />
7. Report any counterfeit products to the right sources.<br />
8. Safely dispose of fake flea treatment products and don&#8217;t use them on your pets.</p>
<p><em>What do counterfeit flea products look like?</em></p>
<p>Most counterfeit flea products really look similar and the differences are harder to identify. Opening the package is usually a good way to get a look to verify.</p>
<p>Here is a slide show of some of the counterfeit products:</p>
<div style="width: 480px; text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="360" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://w261.photobucket.com/pbwidget.swf?pbwurl=http://w261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/b2f5988c.pbw" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="360" src="http://w261.photobucket.com/pbwidget.swf?pbwurl=http://w261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/b2f5988c.pbw" wmode="transparent"></embed></object></div>
<p>Compare to this slide show of legitimate products:</p>
<div style="width: 480px; text-align: center;"><object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="360" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://w261.photobucket.com/pbwidget.swf?pbwurl=http://w261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/4cc42bdd.pbw" /><param name="wmode" value="transparent" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="360" src="http://w261.photobucket.com/pbwidget.swf?pbwurl=http://w261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/4cc42bdd.pbw" wmode="transparent"></embed></object></div>
<p>Those who distribute, import, or sell counterfeit pesticides such as Advantage and Frontline are subject to civil or criminal penalties up to $27,500 per sale, one year imprisonment, or both.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/Pesticide-Warningred.jpg" alt="" width="208" height="232" />Recently counterfeit flea treatment products have been surfacing with alarming regularity.</p>
<p>People are reporting that certain flea control products are not working&#8211;but what is suspected is that they have purchased counterfeit flea products instead of the real thing.</p>
<p>Common complaints about questionable flea medications are:</p>
<p>1) that the product does not work and that the fleas have developed a resistance to the product, and</p>
<p>2)  the horrible consequences when  some animals experience adverse reactions to the counterfeit products.</p>
<p>Counterfeit flea products  do not include the same ingredients as the real ones OR they contain additional ingredients that  harm pets.</p>
<p>The EPA recently released a educational handout for retailers  to aid in <a href="http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/factsheets/retailerfactsh.pdf" target="_blank">identifying counterfeit flea medication</a>.</p>
<p>It seems that the following registered products tend to be targeted by unscrupulous sellers:</p>
<p><em>Although the following  brand names are  EPA registered  numbers of legitimate products, many of the counterfeit flea meds use the same names and numbers.</em></p>
<p>* Frontline Top Spot for Cats (EPA Reg. No. 65331-2)<br />
* Frontline Top Spot for Dogs (EPA Reg. No. 65331-3)<br />
* Frontline Plus for Cats (EPA Reg. No. 65331-4)<br />
* Frontline Plus for Dogs (EPA Reg. No. 65331-5)</p>
<p>* Advantage 10 for Dogs (EPA Reg. No. 11556-117)<br />
* Advantage 20 for Dogs (EPA Reg. No. 11556-119)<br />
* Advantage 55 for Dogs (EPA Reg. No. 11556-120)<br />
* Advantage 100 for Dogs (EPA Reg. No. 11556-122)<br />
* Advantage 9 for Cats (EPA Reg. No. 11556-116)<br />
* Advantage 18 for Cats (EPA Reg. No. 11556-118)</p>
<p>It is hard to identify counterfeit flea medication products from the actual EPA registered flea meds because they often look identical.</p>
<p>However, in the next post I&#8217;ll get into how to avoid falling for counterfeit flea control products.</p>

<p>The data, collected by the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center, also indicate the overwhelming majority of animal illnesses associated with proper use of spot-on flea and tick control products are mild.</p>
<p>&#8220;Products labeled for dogs must never be used on cats—doing so can result in serious illness and even death,&#8221; says Dr. Louise Murray, Medical Director of the ASPCA&#8217;s Bergh Memorial Animal Hospital. &#8220;A veterinarian must always be consulted before using spot-on flea and tick treatments on very young, old, sick or pregnant pets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ASPCA receives more than 700 calls daily from veterinarians and pet parents, resulting in over 150,000 annual cases involving medications, insecticides, plants and foods.</p>
<p>ASPCA epidemiologist Dr. Margaret Slater analyzed data from public calls managed by the ASPCA regarding flea and tick products. The data identified two key findings.</p>
<p>1. When cats were treated inappropriately (not per label directions), they are significantly more likely to experience severe reactions: no illness despite a call to the ASPCA (18%), mild illness (17%), moderate illness (45%), major illness (19%), and death (2%).</p>
<p>2. When dogs and cats were treated correctly (per label directions), the likelihood of severe adverse reaction was significantly less: no illness despite a call to the ASPCA (7%), mild illness (69%), moderate illness (22%), major illness (2%), and death (0.1%).</p>
<p>&#8220;The important take home message is that although adverse reactions can occur with all flea and tick products, most effects are relatively mild and include skin irritation and stomach upset,&#8221; says Dr. Steven Hansen, ASPCA veterinary toxicologist and Senior Vice President Animal Health Services. &#8220;Pet parents should not discontinue using products as directed by the product label when faced with a flea infestation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Using products as directed and making necessary adjustments based on health will greatly reduce adverse reactions from flea and tick or any other medical products.</p>
<p>Fleas cause anemia (low blood counts), carry tapeworms, and can transmit infections such as Bartonella; ticks transmit many diseases including Lyme Disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The risk to pets from these diseases is greater than the risk of adverse reactions when products are use appropriately.</p>

<p>The data from the ten year study showed that fleas collected from around the globe continue to be highly susceptible to<em> imidacloprid</em> today as they were when the monitoring commenced.</p>
<p>There is much speculation over whether or not fleas are developing immunity to flea control products but few studies have been announced to the public.</p>
<p>2009 marks the 10th year for the Flea Susceptibility Monitoring program. Of the 1356 samples that have been submitted, 1014 samples have been analyzed and 13 flea isolates identified for more detailed laboratory investigation.</p>
<p>After additional testing none of those isolates were considered to have reduced susceptibility. The ongoing monitoring through the innovative Flea Susceptibility Monitoring program confirms that veterinarians and pet owners can continue to trust in imidacloprid, which is the active ingredient in Bayer Animal Health&#8217;s <em>Advantage®</em> Topical Solution and <em>K9 Advantix®</em>.</p>
<p>The Bayer Animal Health-funded Flea Susceptibility Monitoring program is the first and only initiative of its kind in the field of companion animal parasites and includes a group of internationally renowned, independent researchers.</p>
<p>Under the international program, data is collected from the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>In the United States over 100 clinics in 23 states are involved in the collection of field isolates which are then sent for testing to independent laboratories in California and Alabama.</p>
<p>The methodology utilized by the Flea Susceptibility Monitoring follows a three-step approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Flea egg samples are collected by participating veterinarians from infested animals and sent to the monitoring laboratories for testing. Twenty eggs are reared on media containing 3 ppm imidacloprid (the diagnostic dose) and 20 in media without imidacloprid (controls).</p>
<p>2. Adult emergence is measured and if &gt;5%, that population of fleas is maintained to allow further laboratory evaluation of susceptibility.</p>
<p>3. The third evaluation step is to investigate the susceptibility of the flea population when placed on dogs and treated with Advantage®.</p></blockquote>
<p>To date, no isolates have survived the second stage of the testing process, proving the long-standing efficacy of imidacloprid in killing fleas.</p>
<p>Monitoring the performance of current agents like imidacloprid helps to maintain a longer, viable product life.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/flea-rinses-dips-cat-in-tub.jpg" alt="" width="174" height="217" />This last week I read a horrible posting from a person whose kittens had fleas.</p>
<p>She would not take them to a veterinarian and wrote about how <strong>the kittens were dying after she applied flea treatment on to the kittens.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The kittens were convulsing and having trouble breathing as they died</strong>&#8211;it was both cruel and stupid.</p>
<p>In case you are not aware, it is not safe to apply flea treatments on young kittens.</p>
<p>On most flea control packages it states&#8211;&#8221;not for use on kittens under&#8230;&#8221; usually 8 to 12 weeks of age.</p>
<p>Nor is it a good idea to treat the mother without supervision of a veterinarian.</p>
<p>Some vets will ask their clients to take specific measures so that kittens do not suffer or die from flea bite anemia or other flea complications&#8211;but <strong>you should always check with your veterinarian before treating young animals (or their mothers) for fleas</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have a flea infestation on the queen or her kittens&#8211;CALL YOUR VETERINARIAN IMMEDIATELY for help.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to treat fleas on a mother cat and her kittens?</strong><br />
Ideally, your queen will be flea free before she gives birth.</p>
<p>If you need to treat your cat and kittens you&#8217;ll need to use the <a href="http://fleacontrolsecrets.com/fleatreatment/2009/07/discover-the-triangle-of-successful-flea-control-video/">Triangle of Successful Flea Control </a>(outlined in Flea Control Secrets). After implementing the suggestions from the video, make sure you provide bedding that contains natural flea remedies INSIDE the bed.</p>
<p>Cedarwood is considered a low toxicity natural flea repellent for use in pet bedding.</p>
<p>Daily vacuuming and bed cover changing are two other necessary techniques.</p>
<p>Next, flea comb both the queen and the kittens.</p>
<p>If you have a heavy infestation you may be forced to use a non-toxic water dip or gentle shampoo solution.</p>
<p>Make sure to use warm water and use a room heater to increase the ambient temperature.</p>
<p>Warm some towels in the clothes dryer for use immediately after washing or water dipping the kitten.</p>
<p>If you prefer a water dip, just hold the kitten in the warm water for about five minutes and use a sprayer to help massage and dislodge the fleas.</p>
<p>Otherwise, many vets suggest bathing the kittens with a warm washcloth or in warm water using the gentle non-toxic baby or pet shampoo (avoiding the nose, ears and eyes) to create suds in the kitten&#8217;s fur. Leave the suds on for about five minutes before rinsing.</p>
<p>In their efforts to escape, fleas will crawl up to the head, nose, eyes and ears. You can use a small wash cloth to form a barrier around the neck or simply catch them with your fingers or tweezers.</p>
<p>Following these methods, wrap the kitten up in a warm towel and dry well. If you use a hair dryer make sure the setting is on low and blow from a distance so you don&#8217;t harm the feline.</p>
<p>Once the kitten&#8217;s fur is dry, again use the flea comb to remove any remaining fleas or flea dirt.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to then place the kitten on a covered heating pad and let the mother or the kitten groom.</p>
<p>Be sure to also clean the mom&#8211;which may or may not be as easy.</p>
<p>It is often necessary to repeat this process a least once a week for the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p><em>Do you or your veterinarian have a method you recommend for kittens fleas? If so, leave a comment below.</em></p>

<p>In an effort to promote its Capstar flea control product to owners and operators of boarding kennels, Novartis Animal Health U.S. has launched, <em>The Biggest Little Thing Contest</em>.</p>
<p>From the contest website:<br />
&#8220;As a boarding facility operator, you know there are a lot of little things you do that have a big impact on your business. Like taking a proactive approach to flea control by providing every dog and cat that visits your facility with a CAPSTAR® (nitenpyram) Tablet to ensure a flea-free stay.</p>
<p>CAPSTAR, in partnership with Pet Product News International, will publish the top 10 biggest little things boarding facilities around the country do to keep ahead of the competition. If your idea is published, your facility will be featured in Pet Product News International and you will win $200. To become eligible, <a href="http://www.thebiggestlittlething.com/">please fill out the information&#8230;&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Deadline for tips is Oct. 31, 2009 and <a href="http://www.thebiggestlittlething.com/">tips should be 50 words or less and can be submitted here</a>.</p>
<p>Capstar is one of the products listed and discussed in <em>Flea Control Secrets</em>. The section on Capstar reveals that studies (on nitnpyram) reported  more than 90% effectiveness against adult fleas within four to six hours depending on the species.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/obsolete-flea-collar.jpg" alt="" width="226" height="90" />I&#8217;ve been seeing a lot of questions and comments related to flea collars and wanted to make sure that people knew that Consumer Reports actually determined that flea collars are NOT effective for killing fleas.</p>
<p>Herbal flea collars can help repel fleas but they don&#8217;t do anything to help get rid of them AND are usually only effective on the front portion of the animal.</p>
<p>Chemical flea collars are toxic and a danger to your household&#8211;they work in the same fashion as the herbal collars but pose more risks.</p>
<p>Better options to address fleas including bathing your pet in oatmeal pet shampoo. Contrary to popular belief&#8211;you don&#8217;t need to use pesticide shampoos because if you bath an animal and leave the suds on for about 15 minutes&#8211;this will kill the fleas.</p>
<p>After bathing there are non-toxic flea sprays that can be used on the animal to repel adult fleas. For instance, you can make a solution of apple cider vinegar and water and spray onto the coat to help repel the pests.</p>
<blockquote><p>BTW: Pets should not be bathed more than once a week during an infestation.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are other options and, in most cases, I prefer to use less toxic options (which I outline in the Flea Control Secrets eBook).</p>
<p>The problem is that even if you address the fleas that you find on the animal, they compromise only about 5% of the total flea population!</p>
<p>Treating the interior and exterior areas of your environment is necessary to get the fleas under control.  Once you do that, you also need to retreat every 3 to 6 weeks to keep the pests under control.</p>

<p>To date the actual spot-on flea control incidents triggering this advisory included:</p>
<p><strong>2007</strong><br />
Death 560<br />
Major 610<br />
Minor/Moderate/Unspecified 21,000<br />
Moderate 1,600<br />
Minor 1,500<br />
Unspecified 140</p>

ASPCA epidemiologist Dr. Margaret Slater analyzed data from public calls managed by the ASPCA regarding flea and tick products. The data identified two key findings. When cats were treated inappropriately (not per label directions), they are significantly more likely to experience severe reactions: no illness despite a call to the ASPCA (7%), mild illness (69%), moderate illness (22%), major illness (2%), and death (0.1%). no illness despite a call to the ASPCA (18 percent), mild illness (17 percent),<strong> moderate illness (45 percent)</strong>, <strong>major illness (19 percent)</strong> and<strong> death (2 percent)</strong>.<a href="http://www.aspca.org/pressroom/press-releases/060309.html" target="_blank"> Read the whole ASPCA release here.</a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.catchannel.com/news/2009/07/13/epa-continues-to-evaluate-flea-tick-products.aspx" target="_blank">EPA is supposed to release their findings this month</a> but has not yet made any recall announcements.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://i261.photobucket.com/albums/ii51/guerreroink/fleacontrolsecrets/identify-flea-for-pullout.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="242" />Since I recently completed <strong>Flea Control Secrets</strong> (after extensive research and fact checking) it is a shock to see how much inaccurate flea treatment advice circulates.</p>
<p>Many people seek information on how to kill fleas, and although the advice shared may be well meaning, it can be downright deadly to your pet!</p>
<p>There is also a lot of conflicting information regarding the safety of &#8220;<em>natural flea remedies</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, some of those natural flea control treatments can be just as toxic as some of the chemical products available&#8230;more on that later.</p>
<p>Since the <a href="http://budurl.com/EPASpotOn" target="_blank">EPA Advisory</a> I&#8217;ve been waiting to see if their update is going to appear (originally targeted for this month) but no word yet.</p>
<p>In the meantime two interesting announcements were released, <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/frontline/fleacontrol/prweb2609514.htm" target="_blank"><strong>Frontline Plus has launched a flea treatment reminder service</strong> </a>and a<strong> <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm801334v" target="_blank">study was finally published concerning the discovery of another flea and tick control product </a></strong>(funded by Merck).</p>
<p>I keep updates at <a href="http://twitter.com/FleaControlBook" target="_blank">Twitter so make sure to follow me there</a>!</p>
