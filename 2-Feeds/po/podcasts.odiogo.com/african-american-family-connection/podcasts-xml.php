      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young women are making the choice to become sexually active at an alarming rate and even more disturbing as young as age nine.</p>
<p>We live in a sexually charged society with messages of sexuality threaded into every media outlet possible and what is intended for adult entertainment is viewed by children and teenagers. Children and teens imitate what they see in popular culture.</p>
<p>Family values can have a positive impact on the choices that teens make when it comes to sexual activity.  Decoding the sound-bites and image for teens is important.  Watch what they watch and listen to what they say about it. Don&#8217;t think they are not exposed, everyone is exposed.</p>
<p>How can a young person make a decision to not become sexually active when the images they see daily and hear in music, commercials and advertisements say that to be accepted, popular and beautiful you must be sexually attractive?</p>
<p>Puberty is age 7 to 11 when girls and boys are shaking off the identity that has been defined by their connection to parents and family group.  Innocence fades, the magical begins to disappear and they begin to identify with their own responses by the defining themselves through their connection with others outside of the family group.</p>
<p>The magical way that children think up to age seven begin to disappear or overshadowed by the biological changes in the body from puberty to the state adolescence. The old saying in the black community &#8220;you are smellin&#8217; yourself&#8221; means that you are attempting to act in grown up ways when your are still just a child that does not understand grown up things.</p>
<p>I watch the six-graders on the playground at my grand-daughter&#8217;s school kiss, touch and grope each other with not attempt to hide it. They are very interested in sexual activity or at least what they can get away while waiting to be picked up by mom or dad. The parents stop and blow their horn, they seem to be pre-occupied and never notice the huddles in the corner.</p>
<p>We are in a desperate situation with teen pregnancy in the African American community. In a recent article on Black America Web it was stated that the United States has the highest rates of teen pregnancy and birth in the entire developed world and that 3 in 10 girls will get pregnant at least once by age 20?</p>
<p>How man young women do you know personally that has gotten pregnant before their 20<sup>th</sup> birthday?</p>
<p>This is everyone&#8217;s problem and we all must get involved actively to advocate abstinence and caution. Mothers and fathers need to talk to their teens about the critical time to make the right decision before they have sex. The consequences are too great and when you are caught up in the moment, it is difficult to STOP and consider the consequences.</p>
<p>Information is powerful if you have the right information. This is Teen Pregnancy Prevention month and the end of the academic year just as we go into the summer months, talk to your children about making intelligent choices before they make a mistake.  There are many things to consider, like STD&#8217;s, HIV/AIDS, Herpes, Mono and the most severe consequence, an unwanted pregnancy.</p>
<p>Make sure you and your teens have the right information by doing the questions on the web sties dedicated to teen pregnancy prevention.Sit down with your teens and discuss the myths and misconceptions they may have about sex and relationships.</p>
<p>The follow questions are a sample of what is available online;</p>
<p>Myths About Getting Pregnant</p>
<p>MYTH: A girl can&#8217;t get pregnant/ a guy can&#8217;t get a girl pregnant if:<br />
1.you have sex standing up<br />
2.you have sex in a hot tub or a swimming pool<br />
3.you jump up and down immediately after sex<br />
4.It&#8217;s your first time<br />
5.the girl pushes really hard on her belly button after sex;<br />
6.the girl makes herself sneeze for fifteen minutes after sex</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Get Serious about discussing the facts and don&#8217;t assume that they already.  It is a mistake to allow your teens get their information from misinformed teens like them.</strong></p>
<p>This problem is everyone&#8217;s responsibility.</p></blockquote>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Featured Author Karmen A Booker</p>
<p>God&#8217;s desire is for us to grow.  This is clearly indicated through the Bible.  Some scriptures that reflect this are:</p>
<h3>(II  Peter 3:18) But grow in grace and recognition and knowledge and understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (the Messiah).  To him be all glory (honor, majesty and splendor) both now to the day of eternity.</h3>
<p>(Ephesians 1:17) . . . the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, that He may grant you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him.</p>
<p>Hebrews 5:13-14 says:</p>
<p>Strong meat are principles that are beyond the foundational principles of the doctrine of Christ.</p>
<p>Hebrews 6:1-2 outlines these principles.  It reads:</p>
<p><strong><em>Therefore, leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of Eternal judgment.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>The Greek word for <strong><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;perfection&#8221;</span></em></strong> is telesphoreo, which means to be a hearer to completion; maturity.</p>
<p>God wants us to strive for maturity in the knowledge of Him.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How Do We Strive for Maturity?</span></p>
<p>By reading, studying, and meditating on the Word of God.  II Timothy 2:15 admonishes us to study.  It says:  <strong><em>Work hard so God can say to you, &#8220;Well done.&#8221;  Be a good workman, one who does not need to be ashamed when God examines your work.  Know what his Word says and means.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>The Greek word for<strong><em> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;spoudazo&#8221;</span></em></strong> means to make effort, be earnest, be diligent, labour.  So we must seek to make time to read the word with understanding, on a consistent basis.  We must be consistently consistent, not consistently inconsistsent.  It is not only important to read and study the Word of God, but to meditate on the Word of God.</p>
<p>Joshua 1:8 reads:  <strong><em>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate on it day and night, then thou shall have good success, and thou shalt make thy way prosperous.</em></strong></p>
<p>The Hebrew word for meditate is <strong><em>&#8220;haw-gaq&#8221;</em></strong> which means to ponder; to think about carefully; deliberate.</p>
<h4>After using the R=reading, S=studying, M=meditating method, we must obey the Word of God.  This requires:</h4>
<h4>A. Walking by Faith - Habbakuk 2:4; Hebrews 11:6</h4>
<h4>B.  Fulfilling our God-given obligation  Ecclesiastes 12:13; I Samuel 15:22</h4>
<h4>C. Walking in God&#8217;s footsteps - Jeremiah 7:23-24 and</h4>
<h4>II Thessalonians 2:15</h4>
<p>When you attach yourself to God, you follow (obey) where he leads.   God becomes the leader, instead of you.  However, you can detach yourself from God by disobeying his Word.  Disobedience causes one to digress (go backward).  As long as you are going backward, you cannot walk forward.  The two directions are diametrically opposed.</p>
<p>Once you start going backwards, you open the door for Satan to wreak havoc in your life through deception and confusion. James 3:16 says:  For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.  However, there is a way to turn and go forward and get back on the straight and narrow path that leads to life - eternal life.  That way is REPENTANCE.</p>
<h3>Benefits of Maturing in Christ Are</h3>
<p align="center"><strong> </strong></p>
<p>1.    Discernment between things of God and the things of the Devil.  I once heard a pastor say this on the radio, &#8220;Once you know the truth, you can recognize a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>2.    Greater Revelation</p>
<p>3.     Wisdom</p>
<h3>Definition of Wisdom</h3>
<p>Wisdom is knowledge and understanding.  (Proverbs 2:6 and Proverbs 1:5 and 7)</p>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Purpose of Wisdom</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>To be able to walk uprightly in honor to God.  God is pleased and greatful when you follow His commandments (Proverbs 4:5-6 an Benefits of Wisdom are</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Avoid a lot of problems and negativity in your life by making right choices</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Bless other people through the wisdom you have gained through counseling and praying with others.</h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Help others to change their lives.</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Continue to Seek Wisdom</h3>
<p>A.   Stay on the straight and narrow path that leads to righteousness and peace.  If you don&#8217;t you&#8217;ll veer off the path, and on to the path of darkness, that leads to much trouble and total destruction.  (Matthew 7:13-14)</p>
<p>B.    Seek wisdom like you would a hidden treasure.  Keep searching until you find it, and once you do, apply it in your life daily.  (Proverbs 8:10-11 and Proverbs 4:7)</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOTE</span></em><em>:  All scriptures are taken from the Amplified Version of the Bible.</em></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black radio is the most significant channel of urban culture and family values in the African American community.</p>
<p>It serves as an important source of news for black families from the black perspective and entertainment for audiences in every ethnic group. Everyone listens to black radio for the drama and buffoonery and to catch up on hot topics.</p>
<p>A rally to &#8220;Save Black Radio&#8221; is scheduled to take place May 13 in front of Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) office in Detroit.</p>
<p>Representative Conyers is an 80-year-old African American congressman who is the sponsor of the Performance Rights Act.</p>
<p>The Performance Rights was originally introduced in February earlier this year designed to collect royalties on local radio for airplay. Commercial radio will have to pay the same fees as Satellite radio.</p>
<p>In a segment on the Tom Joyner Morning Show with Roland Martin and Cathy Hughes, she said that during a meeting in Conyers&#8217; office with opponents of the measure, the congressman &#8220;turned up his CD player so loud that we could not hear anyone talk &#8230; It was turned up to teenage volume.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is unbelievable that a Senator would stoop to such a tactic as to turn up the volume on CD player in the middle of a meeting to avoid hearing what citizens have to say about legislation that affects so many others.</p>
<p>The following is a excerpt from theUS House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary  Press Release February 04, 2009 <a href="http://judiciary.house.gov/news/090204.html">http://judiciary.house.gov/news/090204.html</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The legislation would amend an inequity in America&#8217;s copyright law that exempts over-the-air broadcasters from paying those who perform the music that we listen to on AM and FM radio. Webcasters, satellite radio providers and cable companies are presently required to pay for music they broadcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;All those in the creative chain of musical production - the artists, musicians, and others who enrich us culturally - deserve to be justly compensated for their work,&#8221; said Conyers. &#8220;We have introduced the Performance Rights Act to ensure fairness so that any service that plays music pays those who create and own the recordings - just as satellite, cable and internet radio stations currently do. Working with the Senate, I hope that Congress may act quickly to pass this important legislation to level the playing field between different technologies and ensure rightful compensation to performers.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is going on? Why are they trying to destroy the one medium that is really <strong>the</strong> pulse of the black community?</p>
<p>Radio is not only about the music; it speaks the same language and conveys the message in the way that it can be heard effectively by those that choose to tune in.</p>
<p>When I was a child black radio was a rare jewel in the community and served to bridge the gap in communication where communities were cut off or excluded from mainstream media.</p>
<p>As Cathy Hughes stated, it is the responsibility of the record executives and companies to pay the individuals that sing or perform in any way on a song why should the radio stations pay residuals anyone other than the writers who hold the copyright to the song?</p>
<p>Performance royalties are tracked and paid out by the performance rights organizations like ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, and SoundExchange.</p>
<p>The royalty process begins once a song is registered with one of the three performing rights organizations.</p>
<p>Once a song is registered, it becomes part of that PRO&#8217;s (performing rights organization) collection and is available to all of its users. Most of those users have a &#8220;blanket license&#8221; to use any or all of the PRO&#8217;s music, however some users license on a <strong>per program</strong> basis and only pay for the music they actually use.</p>
<p>The PROs  performing rights organizations deduct money for their operating expenses and the rest goes to the songwriters and publishers.</p>
<p>Every since the writers strike in the television industry people have become greedy and money driven about how much money they are not getting through every available medium.  It is my understanding that when you agree legally to participate in producing music you cross your &#8220;i&#8217;s&#8221; and dot your &#8220;t&#8217;s&#8221; to ensure your compensation.</p>
<p>What happened to fuel this performance tax and why does someone like Conyers have an axe to grind with urban radio? Who has been affected by this that it has become another form of racism to black radio?</p>
<p>While the resolution will be framed in terms of preventing a &#8216;tax,&#8217; &#8216;fee,&#8217; or &#8216;burden&#8217; on local radio stations, in reality, the only payment broadcasters would be required to make would be for the use of someone else&#8217;s property.&#8221; <a href="http://hiphopnews.yuku.com/topic/1015">http://hiphopnews.yuku.com/topic/1015</a></p>

<p>The (Greek) word for sin is <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;harmartano&#8221;</span>,</em> which means to miss the mark not share in the prize); to err due to faults; offend; trespass.</p>
<p>The (Hebrew) word for sin is <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&#8220;chata&#8221;,</span></em> which means to miss; forfeit; lack; to cause to lead astray.</p>
<p>When a person sins, they miss the mark.  That is, they miss the blessings of love, joy, peace, and fulfillment that come with obeying God&#8217;s Word.</p>
<p>In I Timothy 3:16, it says that <em>&#8220;all scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&#8221;</em> Therefore, the Word of God is your Instruction Book for Life.  It leads and guides you along life&#8217;s journey.  <em>&#8220;Your Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light to my path.&#8221; </em></p>
<p>(Psalm 119:105)</p>
<p>The key to this powerful Instruction Book for Life is that you must have faith in it.  Faith means more than just believing. It means totally trusting, depending upon and being confident (assured) of the Word of God.</p>
<p>(In John 1:1), it says that <em>&#8220;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word was with God Himself.&#8221;</em> He was present originally with God.  All things were made and came into existence through Him; and without Him was not even one thing made that has come into being.  In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of men.</p>
<p>God admonishes us to love the Lord (Word) with all your heart, mind, and soul.  We show that we love the Lord (Word) by obeying it.  <em>&#8220;. . . obey His voice according to all that I command you today, you and your children, with all your mind and heart and with all your being.&#8221;</em> (Deuteronomy 30:2) We should not just be hearers of the Word, but doers also. (James 1:22)</p>
<p>When you obey the Word of God, you live a life of prosperity, good success, and wisdom.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This book of the law shall not depart out of my mouth, but I shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe and do according to all that is written in it.  For then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall deal wisely and have good success.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>(Joshua 1:8)</p>
<p><em>&#8220;So everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts upon them (obeying them) will be like a sensible man who builds his house upon the rock.&#8221;</em> (Matthew 7:24)</p>
<p>Another key to the Instruction Book of Life having operation in your life and yielding results is to deny your will and emotions.  You must deny your desires (to sleep in rather than go to church), emotions</p>
<p>(to maintain anger rather than forgive), and will (work a job, rather than start the business God wants you to start), and Make a Decision to Follow God&#8217;s Will.</p>
<p>You must deny the self life - self seeking; self pleasing, self confidence, and self satisfaction.   You must be liberated from the self life.  Only then, will you be able to experience the fullness of God - the abundant life that comes from reading, studying, and meditating and applying the Word of God in your life.  Thereby, pleasing and glorifying God.</p>
<p>The denial of self is a daily process that requires a daily decision of denying self and accepting God&#8217;s will for your life.  Your life will be constantly renewed (changed) to conform to God&#8217;s way (attitude, emotions, and actions) of living.  As your mind is renewed and your actions conform to the Word of God, then you will experience love, joy and peace and good success.</p>
<p>God desires for his children to enjoy life on an ongoing basis.  Not just 3 years, 5 years, or 10 years, but throughout their life.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I came that they may have and enjoy life, and have it in abundance to the full, till it overflows.&#8221; </em>(John 10:10)</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The Lord is my strength and my impenetrable Shield:  my heart trusts in, relies on, and confidently leans on Him, and I am helped; therefore my heart greatly rejoices, and with my song will I praise Him. The Lord is their (unyielding) Strength, and He is the Stronghold of salvation to His anointed.&#8221;</em> (Psalm 28:7-8)</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The wind beneath our wings so we can soar the greatest heights of our capability&#8221; that is what a mother does. She teaches us to trust our ability not just to fly, to soar!</p>
<p>What are you doing in your life right now this very minute that reflects what you learned from your mother? The values that you live by are the one you learned from whoever raised you.</p>
<p>How did you turn out as a fully functioning adult living, loving and learning making a positive contribution to the world?</p>
<p>Family values will always be the most important to mothers because it determines what kind of citizen did you turned out to be. Mothers want to raise individuals that become great leaders and people that do positive things that leave an impact on the world.</p>
<p>Mothers will always keep the light on for you and pray that you are protected in all things. Where else can you get a warm clean place to sleep with access to cable and the internet not to mention hot meals and free laundry for little or nothing?</p>
<p>It is a mother&#8217;s mission in life to provide safety, energy and possibility for her babies, her offspring, her seed and the many other children she nurtures that are not hers.</p>
<p>You are the person that she carried safely in her body and gave birth to; her energy assisted in your arrival to the earth realm because you survived birth; once you are here the possibility of your life and all that you are destined to become is what the journey of motherhood is all about.</p>
<p>Whatever the circumstances may be, your mother provided an opening for your arrival to the life you have inherited or created. You can&#8217;t blame anyone for what you are doing or not doing to soar.</p>
<p>What happens between you and your mother is a phenomenon because it is not only through a birth connection that a mother/child relationship develops.</p>
<p>The mother connection in your life can be a surrogate mother figure that could even be your father or another kinship connection. An older sibling, an auntie, grandparent, or a non-related person that gives you advice can act as you mother figure.</p>
<p>If a parent is missing in our lives, we look naturally to others that fill the parental role. We have been taught how to parent ourselves from the parent of a childhood friend or guardian in a foster home. Someone, somewhere in our lives has shown us a parental connection.</p>
<p>The tragedy of not having a mother connection creates a disturbing life crisis and disconnect from family values which for some wreaks havoc on relationships.</p>
<p>Not learning to develop a true connection with your mother gives you no reference to how to create a connection with another person.</p>
<p>How many people have blamed mistakes on their past experiences at the hands of their mother for the acts they commit as adults?</p>
<p>Motherhood is a journey into the unknown realm with no road map and no instructions based on pure faith driven by love and complete devotion.</p>
<p>When you celebrate mothers remember to be forgiving for any mistakes you believe that your mother made. Remember she did her best while she was still growing and becoming a whole person in her own way.</p>
<p>Many mothers today suffer from illness and depression due to self neglect, stress and uncontrollable circumstances. No mother wants to be a burden to her family.</p>
<p>The person that was the backbone of your family that made daily sacrifices for your comfort and well-being may need you now.  Be available, be open, and be honest in honoring your mother.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t just give lip service, mean it and demonstrate it.</p>
