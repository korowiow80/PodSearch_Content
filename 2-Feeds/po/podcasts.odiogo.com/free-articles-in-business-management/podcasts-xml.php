      <guid>http://business-management.bestmanagementarticles.com/a-34673-create-a-lasting-memory-for-your-customers.aspx</guid>

People who expect a certain level of service become very critical when it slips even one iota. When dealing with the public you and your staff should constantly try to provide extras that go above the standard. It's these little things that often solidify the knowing part of memory.
