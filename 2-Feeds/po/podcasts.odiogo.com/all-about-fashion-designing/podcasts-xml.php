      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left; padding: 12px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/cc/man_fashion32.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/cc/man_fashion32.jpg" title='man fashion' alt='man fashion' /></a></div>
<p><br/><br/> <br />
The spices of life are more to some and less to others. Contrary to a captain with no hull beneath his deck, but a good steady wind and a pair of Denim flares more befitting a weatherworn sailor feeling his years, to the Far East in search of spices. Time and tide won’t let a sailor sleep.<br />
Now it’s the spices of fashion for men, the rising tide: And, dandyism still contrasting Beau Brummell rejection of 18th century frills, his mandate; a dark blue coat, buff-coloured pantaloons and waistcoat, black boots and a clean white neck cloth.<br />
The modern sailor’s uniform, endures and has remained a popular choice for designers to mimic idiosyncratic characters, a simple uniform to draw inspiration from; each changing style to suit forms and functions.<br />
A little more evidence on how history in fashion repeats itself: Bell bottomed trousers were another &#8216;icon&#8217; of the square rig uniform. These were practical garments for men who worked sailing ships since they could be rolled up securely to clear the feet and ankles when working the rigging. In common with all other items of a sailor&#8217;s kit, trousers were kept folded ready for use in a kit bag. Kept inside out to avoid fluff on the outer surface and to avoid &#8217;shine&#8217; by ironing, they were folded horizontally at about a hand&#8217;s width and taped into a rectangular &#8216;block&#8217;. When worn, this produced inverted vertical creases down the side of the leg and five or seven, depending on the height of the wearer, horizontal creases down the leg. In time these were accepted as the thing to have and were pressed firmly into place from the early years of the century. Since the First World War bell bottoms were purchased for tradition rather than any practical use but were replaced by flared trousers in 1977.<br />
The three white tapes were said to commemorate Nelson’s three great battles – The Nile, Copenhagen and Trafalgar. However there is no truth in this – the Admiralty were at one time considering the merits of two stripes as against three. Sailors were assigned to various jobs according to their skill. &#8230; Before 1857 there was no uniform for Royal Navy seamen, who usually wore baggy trousers &#8230; The modern sailor&#8217;s uniform is the culmination of centuries of tradition and innovation. From silk stockings, frock coats and night caps.<br />
In 1756 a children’s uniform of &#8217;sailor&#8217;s dress&#8217; with distinctive leather caps was adopted, instead of the uniform based on what the pensioners wore. &#8230;<br />
The sailor&#8217;s collar deserves a special mention. Tarred pig tails disappeared rapidly after 1815 and the last is recorded as having been seen at sea in 1827. On the other hand, the first broad collars were worn after 1830. Contrary to popular belief, therefore, the two were never worn together.<br />
Enough sea faring stories; now, the gentleman, endowed with wisdom, true to word and honourable handshake. Bereft of principles; no gentleman.<br />
So, clothes befitting is not distinguishable enough to judge mans true character, he chooses to wear governed by mood, taste, budget, status or advice? A pair of faded jeans and linen shirt and sneakers, or the best cut suit from Savile Row and a pair of Floorshiems for the feet<br />
However it’s what suits the individual taste in fashion. The things that add spice to menswear clothing are the accessories, like silk ties, cravats, or scarves. Men wear label badges as recognition of status or club membership. Then there are endless choices of cufflinks in silver Swarovski crystals and most traditionally enamels.<br />
Even more fortunate for the modern man are designers who mark a new creative direction for men’s clothing and accessories. A few fine examples, Vivienne Westwood, Timothy Everest, Ian Flaherty.<br />
A practitioner of strategic planning in business alignment: He is developing a new brand of fashion accessories for men as a truly independent alternative: Concurrently purveying designer silk ties, silver, crystal and enamel cufflinks, fine leather wallets, plus a collection of jewellery by noted British designers, such as, Vivienne Westwood, Timothy Everest, Ian Flaherty, Veritas, Lbb London, Simon Carter, Michelsons and Shane McCoubrey. Perpetuating traditional English made clothing accessories is part of our ethos.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left; padding: 12px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/cc/fashion_design32.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/cc/fashion_design32.jpg" title='fashion design' alt='fashion design' /></a></div>
<p><br/><br/>More and more young people are choosing fashion design when they are quizzed about their future choice in a career and who can blame them. A career in fashion design means having a great job creating clothing concepts that will influence the way that people look all over the planet. One thing that many people are not aware of, is that top designers have a way of making it all look so easy when in fact they have put in years of work and study to get to the pinnacle that they are at.</p>
<p>To be successful at fashion design, one must be able to do a wide variety of tasks well including drawing, selecting colors and fabric types and sewing just to name a few things that a good designer must do well. Another thing that a good designer must have is vision, because the designs that they create have to be a year ahead of the popular trends in fashion.</p>
<p>This is because, what you see on the racks in clothing stores this spring were actually thought up over a year ago. This is when the designer first began to sketch designs and try to imagine what they will actually look like when than are finally constructed. It takes a full year for a designer to design and create a line of clothing and if the designer is wrong on which direction that they predicted fashion would take they will be out of business.</p>
<p>If you are considering fashion design as a career choice then now is the time to start your studies by learning to sketch your ideas. Sketching is a great way to work out idea concepts without having to go through the time and expense of actually constructing anything. Also, it is important to remember that the only way that you are going to communicate your ideas in fashion is with sketches. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left; padding: 12px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/cc/designing31.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/cc/designing31.jpg" title='designing' alt='designing' /></a></div>
<p><br/><br/>There are a lot of applications which can be used to design a website. The most important thing prior to designing a website is to look for the best web design software available on the market. When using a good web design software, the benefits that you might obtain can be priceless. Sometimes, wrongly choosing a web design software can get your website slow loading or even incompatible with other browsers.</p>
<p>Many web design softwares use the WYSIWYG editor. It means that whatever you’ll see on the web design software is what you’ll get when you publish your website. The web design software provides you with a platform where you can build your website and make it look the way you want it to appear to your visitors. There are many popular web design softwares on the market nowadays. A popular web design software is Dreamweaver. Another well known web design software is the Microsoft FrontPage. Adobe Dreamweaver is a professional web design software that is used by many developers worldwide. Dynamic websites can be created with Adobe Dreamweaver. The drawback with such a web design software is that it may require a lot of hours to be learnt and utilized in the proper manner.</p>
<p>Moreover, a web design software such as Microsoft FrontPage as well has a lot of features. Surveys demonstrate that people prefer to use Dreamweaver rather than FrontPage because of its user friendly characteristics. But either way, the usage of each of the web design software can create good results if known how to handle correctly. Similar to the web design software, Dreamweaver, FrontPage has the split view which lets users see the codes while they are making the design. So, if the user clicks on a table, its code will be highlighted in the code section of the web design software. Such features can be very useful to professional web designers and coders.</p>
<p>Furthermore, yet another popular web design software is the XSitePro. This web design software is relatively new in the market and has been built to come to the help of people who are mainly new to web design. All the features on Dreamweaver and FrontPage may not be used by most users. So, a web design software such as XSitePro addresses to this situation by providing only the tools that intermediate or novice web designers need. By providing this, the web design software has gained popularity and hence can be used by anyone who wants to create a design.</p>
<p>However, the drawback with XSitePro is that it can be somehow be difficult to create dynamic websites on. Also, its look and feel differs from the conventional WYSIWYG web design software. Hence, if you are used to creating your designs with Dreamweaver and FrontPage, then XSitePro can be very difficult to get accustomed to. Therefore, the best way to get much out of your web design software is to use the WYSIWYG. It can make your work run faster but all you need is the correct choice of the web design software.</p>

<p><br/><br/>Oscar de la Renta is a fashion designer generally considered to be one of the top professionals in that area by fashion critics. De la Renta was born in the Dominican Republic. At the age of 18, he flew to Madrid, Spain, where he studied painting at the Academy Of San Fernando. Oscar&#8217;s artistic side, however, would soon start turning ways onto the designing side. He showed interest in the world of fashion designing and soon found work with some of Spain&#8217;s top fashion houses as a sketcher. A little later, he took fashion designing class with one of Spain&#8217;s top couturiers, Cristobal Balenciaga.</p>
<p>De la Renta later moved to Paris, where he joined Antonio Castillo as a couture assistant. In 1963, de la Renta found himself in New York, where he worked for Elizabeth Arden among others. That provided de la Renta with incalculable experience, which he would later need to launch his own signature trademark of clothing lines and perfumes.</p>
<p>In 1965, Oscar de la Renta reached his dream of launching those signature lines, and his life changed. As a fashion designer, he has reached worldwide fame and fortune, and he has been able to buy mansions in his homeland and the United States.</p>
<p>Apart from the signature Oscar de la Renta products, he was able to launch the Pink Label products, and has ventured into the world of women&#8217;s accessories, men&#8217;s clothing, sportswear and perfumes.

<p><br/><br/>For many people learning the difference between a genuine designer product and a counterfeit is a horrible experience. This is because, they learn when they first start wearing what they thought was a genuine product that they have bought online. </p>
<p>They might notice that the fabric doesn&#8217;t look or feel right, because it is a cheap imitation. Also, it may not fit correctly and will have the fit of a cheap shirt from a discount store. Sure it will have the designer label on it but when they look closely the stitching will be crooked and may even be coming undone. </p>
<p>When a button falls off they then know that something is wrong, because all of the other buttons are coming loose too. Its not a second that had slipped by the designers quality control process, because that just doesn&#8217;t happen and designers destroy all of their seconds. </p>
<p>Its a counterfeit and the sad fact is that the whole mess could have been avoided. Buying designer clothing and fashion accessories at a discount from obscure Asian sources is a sure fire way to get ripped off. Also, all websites are now required by law to list full contact information such as a phone number and an address. </p>
<p>If they aren&#8217;t listed there is a good reason why, it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t want to hear from the people that they have ripped off. There are good deals to be had when shopping online for discount designer clothing and fashion accessories but you have to do some research on your source before you lay down your cash. </p>
<p>If you intentionally buy counterfeit products online then you have no reason to complain when your designer sneakers arrive with glue globs on the sides of your shoes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="float:left; padding: 12px"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/cc/fashion_merchandising27.jpg"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/cc/fashion_merchandising27.jpg" title='fashion merchandising' alt='fashion merchandising' /></a></div>
<p><br/><br/>If you have even a slight interest in fashion, the industry may offer what you need to have an engaging, exciting career. This industry caters to a range of interests, including fashion photography, merchandising, marketing, buying, fashion stylists, and fashion design.</p>
<p>Some have what it takes to survive in the fashion industry. Some don&#8217;t. Some say success in fashion depends on talent, others sure will power. One thing is for sure- very few make it to the top echelon of fame and fortune to design fashion couture. But one may succeed in the fashion industry on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>Merchandising, marketing, and buying skills will most likely be the part of the same job description, unless you work for a large company that can afford to employ specialists in each area. A fashion merchandiser makes sure a storefront puts on a strong front. They are in charge of the presentation of items- the placement of clothing on mannequins- what jewelry highlights which outfit, for example. A fashion merchandiser is a trend spotter in a sense- they keep up on latest trends so they may know what to stock the store with.</p>
<p>Fashion merchandising requires more than a knowledge of what&#8217;s hot in fashion. A merchandiser must also be business savvy- they have to make sure the clothing bought by the store is in the target customer&#8217;s price range, that the store itself can afford to purchase the clothing at a certain price, and how much of the clothing will sell. And a merchandiser will need a few marketing tricks up his or her sleeve. A fashion merchandiser must also know how to negotiate with the suppliers of the clothing. Negotiating skills involve excellent communication and possibly ability to wheel and deal.</p>
<p>Fashion photographers must have the best job in the photography business. The high end photographers get to meet famous people. Fashion photographers must go where the shoot is, so they may take many expenses paid vacations.</p>
<p>A fashion stylist is the bridge between fashion and psychology. Stylists match clothing to people&#8217;s personalities. A good stylist is able to ensemble an outfit that will list the spirits of the wearer. A fashion stylist may work for individuals and prepare outfits for special events and occasions, or they may work for television shows or on a movie set.</p>
<p>Fashion styling requires pure talent. A stylist must choose clothing that is a flattering color as well as the right fit and shape to flatter the individual&#8217;s body type.</p>
<p>An entrepreneurial nature is a bonus in the fashion industry. Many jobs require you to work for yourself and your success will depend on your ability to market yourself. An entrepreneur must be self-motivated and able to network socially.</p>
<p>The fashion industry is always changing. This makes for a lot of work for someone working in this field, albeit a perfect field for anyone who becomes bored easily! Competitiveness and creativity are perfect personality matches in fashion related occupations. If you have what it takes the fashion industry has a lot to offer.</p>

<p><br/><br/>Preparation is the key to a successful photo shoot for those aspiring for, or embarking on the journey to become a plus size model. Confidence is always visually apparent; being well-prepared, well-groomed and relaxed equates a happy model, with shines through in print! The following is a series of steps to begin one week prior to your shoot, that&#8217;ll help make the most of your shoot.</p>
<p>One week prior to your shoot:</p>
<p>ONE:</p>
<p>Make an honest inspection of your hair. Does your color need refreshing, or do your roots need a touch up? Schedule color three or four days prior to your shoot to allow time for settling, or a re-do if something catastrophic happens. PLEASE do not make major color or style changes without speaking to your agency!! Remember you&#8217;ve been hired for your already determined &#8220;look&#8221; and discussion between the agency that represents you is essential prior to changing it. Plus they&#8217;re in the business of beauty. They&#8217;ll be able to give you excellent, professional suggestions if you&#8217;re looking for a change. It goes without saying, but make sure your hairs trimmed and as split-end free as possible. If you have a fringe, or bangs, make sure it&#8217;s trimmed appropriately. Consider having your stylist apply a shine treatment, as shiny hair equals healthy hair, at least in appearance!</p>
<p>TWO:</p>
<p>Make waxing appointments for two to three days prior to your shoot. If you wax regularly already, schedule your waxing appointment for 2-3 days prior to your shoot to avoid any irritation on your test day. I don&#8217;t recommend preparation for test shots to be an occasion to try waxing for the first time. Until your certain how your skin reacts to the treatment, consider a professional applied depilatory cream to rid yourself of any unwanted facial or body hair.</p>
<p>THREE:</p>
<p>Tend to your skin. Drink plenty of water, avoid excessive alcohol and wheat products if your prone to bloating. Moisturize, moisturize, moisturize! Avoid any drastic, or medical skin treatments prior to your shoot, instead use plenty of moisturizer and good exfoliator at least twice in the before your shoot.</p>
<p>The day before and of your shoot:</p>
<p>1. Get plenty of sleep!</p>
<p>2. Consider your ability in styling your own hair. If you have challenging hair, consider a professional blow-out or curl enhancing treatment prior to your shoot. If done the day before, sleep with a silk handkerchief tied over your hair, it&#8217;ll still look fab on day two. Do NOT arrive to your shoot with damp or wet hair expecting it to be completely styled!</p>
<p>3. Exfoliate your entire body and face and moisturize using a non-greasy, non shimmering lotion.</p>
<p>4. Inspect your nails and toes. Make your hands and toes are well manicured and natural. Chose a natural or clear polish, or if you wear a French manicure make sure it has a softly colored topcoat. Avoid blinding white tips! TRY to avoid acrylic nails, but if you must wear them make sure they&#8217;re fairly short and oval, no long square talons!</p>
<p>5. Make your body modifications invisible. Bring a good concealer if you have tattoos, &#8220;derma blend or Mac body are excellent&#8221; as you will be expected by clients to cover your tattoos. Remove any piercings, studs or barbells. Most clients are steadfast in their preference that models remove all piercings, be prepared for your &#8220;holes&#8221; to possibly close in the name of landing jobs!</p>
<p>The previous tips are a general guide to help you look like the best version of &#8220;you&#8221; on a test shoot! Remember to send the message with your appearance choices that promote the mantra, &#8220;I&#8217;m beautiful, whatever my size may be!&#8221;</p>

<p><br/><br/>The term fashion usually applies to a prevailing mode of expression, but quite often applies to a personal mode of expression that may or may not adhere to prevailing ideals. Inherent in the term is the idea that the mode will change more quickly than the culture as a whole. The terms &#8220;fashionable&#8221; and &#8220;unfashionable&#8221; are employed to describe whether someone or something fits in with the current popular mode of expression. The term &#8220;fashion&#8221; is frequently used in a positive sense, as a synonym for glamour and style. In this sense, fashions are a sort of communal art, through which a culture examines its notions of beauty and goodness. The term &#8220;fashion&#8221; is also sometimes used in a negative sense, as a synonym for fads, trends, and materialism.</p>
