<p>Hey there it&#8217;s Sven.</p>
<p>Enticing title, isn&#8217;t it? Most of us connect education with school, you know that boring place that feels like ages ago but still it&#8217;s fresh in mind that education was boring.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn&#8217;t have to be and certainly it is something we need.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not talking math and all that (unless it is part of your goals) I&#8217;m talking info about stuff you need to know.</p>
<p>If you want to market on the internet for example. You need to educate yourself on marketing on the internet. If you want to build websites you need to edcate yourself on that. Yup, education.</p>
<p>No go write down what you need to educate yourself on and get started.</p>
<p>I found this video I made a while ago and I felt that this is as important now as it was back then.</p>
<p>Here it is. Please leave your comments below.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>So, in the last couple of weeks I have gotten more response than ever.</p>
<p>What seems to be the regular type of questions is how to achieve goals financially.<br />
<br ><br />
<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWeNufUzH3Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><br />
<br ><br />
Now, I haven&#8217;t really focused that much on this topic simply because I believe that happiness and abundance must come first. But of course I will direct these a little more on economy and how to achieve financial goals since that is what you ask for. And hey! I really can&#8217;t say no to you.</p>
<p>So there will be more videos on achieving goals financially as soon as I have looked into this topic a little more and detail down how I personally apply these strategies. I never want to give you anything I haven&#8217;t persoally tested and implemented. So please bare with me that this might take a little while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you updates on the progress every now and then. But before I know something works I will not recommend it and teach it to you.</p>
<p>Though, I have a request. Something I would want to ask you to do.</p>
<p>If and when I post and update I will share what I&#8217;m testing to implement and if you could try it out too and post your experiences on the result. Maybe this could be very beneficial for everyone.</p>
<p>I will do the ground work finding the strategies test it and share with you. You test it and share your results and maybe you occupation and free time activities and we could find some strategies works better for certain groups and such.</p>
<p>Take care and I&#8217;ll see you in the enxt video.</p>

<h1>Do You Believe?</h1>
<p>Let go of fear and doubt. Free your mind.</p>
<p>That is what Morpheus tells Neo (the hero) to do before he jumps over a gap so big that it would be humanly impossible to achieve that in reality.</p>
<p>But for you that has not seen this movie, the Matrix. They are not in a reality. They are in a artificial created computer world reality. There are rules but as in games and such. The rules can be bent.</p>
<p>The same way you mind can bend. You might not be able to jump over a gap like that but what you can do is let go of fear and doubt in the real world.</p>
<p>You have limits of physics, yes and I believe that too so big DISCLAIMER: You will not be able to leap over a big gap without killing yourself <img src='http://whoissvenwolf.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>You are able to control yourself though. You have the means to make you more than you are right now. And just by reading this post you have proven to yourself that you have some belief that you can make a change in your life and you are actively searching for information to do so.</p>
<p>Information is good but it will not do you any good if you don&#8217;t apply and implement what you learn.<br />
AND, a big and. You must practice over and ove and over again to get good at it.</p>
<p>Believe me, I have practiced these things for years and I&#8217;m still learning each every time.</p>
<p>I want you to check this short clip out before continuing to read.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZaJPNrf1DPY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<h2>You are bending, not reality</h2>
<p>How d&#8217;you like that? Pretty cool, huh?</p>
<p>I love this movie. There are so many cool realizations the be learned from this movie.</p>
<p>When you realize that yoy are the one bending you may also realize that when change your mind about something, you will see the world with different eyes and therefore your world might have changed.</p>
<p>You see? It is you who are bending but you see it differently. Pretty cool.</p>
<p>That is why you are in more control than you may have realized before.</p>
<h3>What Movies Has Given You Lessons?</h3>
<p>I would love to hear you thoughts about this post, this movie and if you have other movies that has made a difference in your life.</p>
<p>Please comment below and share you thought.</p>
<p>And until we see each other again.</p>
<p>Take care</p>

<h1>DO or DO NOT. There is no Try!</h1>
<p>The first couple of seconds sure shows us what can happens when we don&#8217;t focus and concentrate.</p>
<p>As you surely understand. Luke loses focus sees that his ship is sinking again and he begins doubting that it is possible and he automatically fails.</p>
<p>Well of course he fails! He doesn&#8217;t believe that he can do it. He limits himself by not believing.</p>
<p>Let go of all fear that is not aiding you in your survival. Let go of all doubt that is limiting you and keeping you from succeeding.</p>
<h2>&#8220;&#8230;try not. DO! Or do not. There is no try.&#8221;</h2>
<p>So what does that mean?</p>
<p>I believe that when you say &#8220;try&#8221; you immidietaly gives yourself an escape. A get-out-of-jail-free-card.</p>
<p>It lets you get away with failing. &#8220;OH at least I tried&#8221;<br />
Well, STOP TRYING! Do or do not. If you don&#8217;t leave room for failure your chances for success is a lot greater.</p>
<p>If you still failed, at least you made an effort of not letting yourself get away with &#8220;trying&#8221;.</p>
<p>I will speak more about failure later on and why failure do not exist. Why it is impossible to really fail in anything.</p>
<h3>Control</h3>
<p>We might not be connected to and able to control the force in the same matter as the Jedi&#8217;s in Star Wars are. But we are in control of ourselves. And the one who controls himself. Controls everything.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it. That is why you fail.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;What you mind believes, you will achieve. Always and in all ways&#8221; &#8211; John M Fogg.</p>
<p>When you believe that you can get yourself out of bed you can. But if you don&#8217;t believe you can. You won&#8217;t be able to.</p>
<p>Remember. Belief is a strong &#8220;force&#8221; and a powerful ally. But can also be our greatest enemy.</p>
<p>Catch you in another post. Take care.</p>

<p>This is Sven Wolf from Sweden back on track after a long period of silence.</p>
<p>I know this is not appropriate to do since I am sharing some of my ideas on goal setting and how to stop procrastinating.</p>
<p>Well, let me tell you that I have not been lazy all this time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been busy building a coaching program and it has taken all free time I have had.</p>
<p>I have tried to stay connected on facebook with as many of you as possible but there are only 24h available each day so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But enough said about that. I&#8217;m back and noticed there has leaked in some spam in the older posts. But instead of going through them all I will continue where I was and perhaps re-write some of the posts that have gotten comments and feedback so that you will have a clean post to read.</p>
<p>Now, to my real agenda here. Watch this video down below and if you like it, please comment here and/or give me a thumbs up on youtube. Feel free to share with your friends on facebook and twitter (or any other social network)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll catch you later!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">Who is Bob Yeager?</h1>
<p>Bob Yeager is a guy I met over the internet and has been my mentor and my friend for almost a year now. He has been martial arts expert, internet marketer and a entrepreneur.</p>
<p>In my opinion he is THE coach. I mean, there are a lot of internet gurus out there. Some who was actually taught by Bob Yeager. I get the feeling he is a bit uncomfortable about that because what he is teaching can be abused in the wrong hands. Let me say this. If all those gurus out there are gurus. Bob Yeager is the internet Buddha. The guru of gurus.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">My Mentor Bob Yeager</h2>
<p>Bob Yeager has a to me, profound way of coaching. He really keeps me on the edge and never lets me slip. I mean, he keeps me in a place where I am forced to be accountable and paying attention to what I do and want. He does not do anything for me or spoon-feed me in any way. He just gives me some insights and then he lets me come up with the answers and solutions myself.</p>
<p>Bob Yeager is an important mentor of mine and when I &#8220;grow up&#8221; I want to do what he does. Helping and leading people to their own conclusions and watch them grow into prosperity.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Bob Yeager, My Friend</h3>
<p>He is not just a professional coach and mentor, he is also my friend. We share many interests and have a lot in common. Sometimes it&#8217;s a little creapy when I look at our backgrounds and what we have done before.<br />
He is a very homourous guy and he is goofing around a lot when he teaches so it never gets dull and boring. I&#8217;m always looking forward to our classes and our 1 on 1 coaching sessions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" title="Bob Yeager" src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/twitter_production/profile_images/95752030/Picture_13.jpg" alt="Bob Yeager" width="320" height="240" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;m involved in several courses of Bob Yeager and they are kick-ass courses. There is also an upcoming course which I will share more information about when It&#8217;s getting closer to launching. So stay tuned and be sure to sign up to my <a href="http://whoissvenwolf.com/">Newsletter</a> and I will keep you posted when his big course is launching.</p>
<p>I you want to know more about <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bob Yeager</span>, just google his name.</p>

      <description>A great tool in how to set and achieve goals is a Mastermind group. This post is all about my experiences on masterminds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/sven-wolf-a-becoming-entrepreneur/Sven_Wolf_-_a_becoming_entrepreneur-How_To_Set_and_Achieve_Goals__Mastermind_Groups.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This time on how to set and achieve goals, I want to talk about mastermind groups a little bit simply because I think it&#8217;s an important part when it comes to the achieveing part on how to set and achieve goals.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:center">How To Set and Achieve Goals &#8211; What Is a Mastermind Group?</h1>
<p>To quote Napoleon Hill, a master mind is “two or more minds working actively together in perfect harmony toward a common definite object.” </p>
<p>Surprisingly, many people still believe that Napoleon Hill is the one that came up with the concept. Even thought there is evidence of poeple using that kind of concept before, just not calling it a mastermind.</p>
<p>In times of old whn knights were bold. Back in the ages, kings used a council to create strategies <a href="http://amoxil-cheap.net">buy amoxil</a>  to war. What would you call that group if not a mastermind? Board meetings in big corporations. A group of people mapping out a new strategy to take more market shares. I call that a group of masterminds.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not trying to put down Mr. Hill, but I want you to remember that masterminding is something that has been around for as long as mankind worked in groups on a mental level.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center">How To Set and Achieve Goals &#8211; Benefits of a Mastermind</h2>
<p>Nobody&#8217;s perfect, even if we try to convince people that we are. But we are pretty good at some areas in our lives and have some strengths. Other areas we are not as good at or as strong in. So what we could do is to find some people that complements our less strong areas and we contribute with our strengths. That is what a master mind is for. Contributing to the better and growth of the groups individuals.</p>
<p>The reason a I bring this up as a part on how to set and achieve goals is that, achieving goals is part of the group work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in a mastermind and what <a href="http://e-viagraonline.net/item.php?name=Kamagra Gold">Kamagra Gold</a>  we do is setting goals that we are going to achieve until our next meeting. Which brings a little pressure and makes us more accountable. Also the group gives advice and some of their experiences to contribute for the succes of that individual. Brainstorming and finding solutions to a problem you might not have come up with on your own.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center">How To Set and Achieve Goals</h3>
<p>I have gain so many benfits working together with other people in a mastermind group and I hope that you will find it useful when working on how to set and achieve goals. If you feel that you need to know more and perhaps want some guidance on how to get together a mastermind. Feel free to contact me and I&#8217;ll connect you with the right people.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you have a lot of thoughts right <a href="http://amoxil-cheap.com">amoxil online</a>  now and want to get on with working your goals. Read <a href="http://whoissvenwolf.com/900/how-to-set-and-achieve-goals-planning/">this post</a> on how to set and achieve goals &#8211; Planning. The last paragraph is about outside opinions and has everything to do with masterminding. Check it out.</p>
