<h2>Financial And Personal Costs</h2>
<p>As the mother of two beautiful daughters, I know how expensive parties can be. Not only that, but I know how much pressure there is on us moms to make this party better than the last and enjoyed by all.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it can be difficult for us moms to enjoy the actual party itself. We spend hours in the kitchen organizing the party treats and so often miss out on watching our children have a great time.</p>
<h2>Ouch!</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, my youngest daughter had a pony-themed party. We had great fun adapting all sorts of party games to the theme. All her friends came as Fantasy Ponies and all of the food and drink was themed. I spent hours and hours searching the internet and local shops for decorations, plates, ribbons and other items to make the theme rock. You name it; I bought it. I kinda got carried away and ended up spending hundreds of dollars. Bad move.</p>
<p>At the party, nobody seemed to care about the color-coordinated place-mats and party hats. Even the pastries I’d hand-decorated with different colored ponies seemed to go unnoticed. Not that I wanted praise or anything; I just wanted everyone to have a good time. However, I was so tired that I didn’t really get to enjoy my girl’s day. I really missed out.</p>
<h2>My Passion</h2>
<p>As you can tell from my blog, I love creating party games. If I’d just concentrated on creating brilliant games, then the children wouldn’t be worried about whether their badges matched their name-plates&#8230;</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I decided to try something different. I had a chat with my eldest daughter whose birthday was coming up and asked her what she wanted to do for her party&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Well, mom, I just wanna have fun&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Me: &#8220;Do you want to have a themed party like your sister?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Daughter: &#8220;I just wanna have fun!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought to myself that this was an excellent opportunity to really test a different approach to my daughters’ parties, where the focus would be on games.</p>
<h2>My Solution?</h2>
<p>I therefore implemented the suggestions made by the <a href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/Birthday-Party-Games-Lady">Birthday Party Games Lady</a>. Her focus is on creating an exciting games environment for the children even <em>before </em>the party arrives. At the moment, she offers five different themed packages (detective, survivor, medieval, Harry Potter and magical).</p>
<p>Each package comes with printable invitations (which you can personalize really easily on your computer), as well as complete game instructions (including a timetable!), printable party favors, a supply list and Thank You Notes which you child can personalize on a computer and send to her friends.</p>
<h2>The Results&#8230;?</h2>
<p>My daughter chose the Survivor Theme and I followed the easy-to-read instructions to the letter. You know what&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8230;The party was a huge success!</p>
<p>All of my daughter’s friends had a great time and my daughter said it was one of her favorite parties EVER! Better than that, I was able to spend so much more time with my daughter and her friends than I have at any of her other parties. This was priceless.</p>
<p>I was over the moon (and not just because I had saved myself hundreds of dollars).</p>
<p>If you’re wondering how to make your daughter’s next party really special and one which you will also enjoy, why don’t you check out the packages offered by the Birthday Party Games Lady by <a href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/Birthday-Party-Games-Lady">clicking here</a> and let me know what you think. You’ll save yourself hundreds of dollars and be the envy of the other moms! <img src='http://www.PartyGamesForGirls.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Emily</p>

Tag is an obvious favorite with many children, as it is simple and everyone knows the rules.</p>
<p>If desired, the girls can suggest additional rules which can make the games more unique and special for them.</p>
<p>The basic message is to keep the games as simple as possible; you don&#8217;t want the girls spending half the time trying to figure out what the rules are rather than actually playing!</p>

Plus they&#8217;re really fun to create!</p>
<p>The most obvious of the mystery party activities is to have a mystery party &#8211; where everyone comes in character and has to solve a mystery.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you have younger children attending, you may want to steer clear of the murder mystery theme. There are many packages available online which offer excellent mystery planning kits. Check them out!</p>

Just think about any of the usual party games you like to play and simplify them. Pass the parcel is a great way for toddlers to interact with each other and learn about sharing.</p>
<p>When wrapping the parcel up, be sure to include lots of colored paper and goodies for everyone, so that everyone is involved.</p>
<p>Maybe even incorporate a sharing element where the players can choose to share their prizes with the others.</p>

<p><a title="The Venetian Dream - il gelato" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26121794@N07/3994756267/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="ice breaker games" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2525/3994756267_638bfb6c4c_m.jpg" border="0" alt="The Venetian Dream - il gelato" width="144" height="240" /></a>Give everyone sticky name badges so their names and readily visible and get everyone to sit in a circle. Starting with one person, they must describe their favorite type of ice-cream, but without giving away the flavor. Each other player has to ask &#8216;yes&#8217; and &#8216;no&#8217; questions to discover the flavor.</p>
<p>The party game gets more difficult towards the end as no flavors can be repeated, so the later players have to be more imaginative!</p>

<p><a title="Smiling in Bubbles_2433c" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/62126383@N00/4066299323/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;" title="birthday theme parties" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2748/4066299323_1a889955e5_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Smiling in Bubbles_2433c" width="162" height="240" /></a>Putting together a theme party can be difficult. You&#8217;ll need to do some brainstorming of what your little girl loves to do (and characters she loves) to get an idea of what sort of theme is appropriate. You&#8217;ll then need to vary the rules of party games to ensure they suit the theme.</p>
<p>Take any of the many <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com" target=" " title="party games for girls">party games for girls</a> in this site and think about how the rules could be altered to match the theme. Get everyone to come in costume and make sure the party food also reflects the theme.</p>
<p>Just remember: any effort you invest in the planning will come back to you many times over both during and after the party!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>With the winter fast approaching and the darker days with us (if you&#8217;re reading from the southern hemisphere, maybe bookmark this post for your winter!), it&#8217;s really fun to have some slumber parties, where the girls can exchange scary stories and sip hot chocolate while it rains outside.</p>
<p>However, this isn&#8217;t enough for a slumber party, so you&#8217;ll need some <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/slumber-party-games" target=" " title="slumber party games">slumber party games</a> for kids to keep them entertained. One such game is Scary Story!</p>
<p><span style="float:left;"><a title="storybook" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/75771631@N00/3140626258/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3195/3140626258_727894fa83_m.jpg" border="0" alt="storybook" /></a></span>Each girl takes it in turns to say three words, with all of the girls telling the story. No one has any idea where the story could take them, but it should be decided upfront whether the story is a scary story or a non-scary story. If you like, each girl can have a secret mission to steer the course of the story towards a particular storyline, with the others guessing which girl has which mission. This uses their creative minds and is great fun to listen to!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>If your little girl loves pretending to be a princess, why not make all her dreams come true and hold a princess themed birthday party for her?</p>
<p>To do this, make sure that all of her friends come in fancydress. In the past, to focus the guests&#8217; attention on the birthday girl, I have asked people to come as characters other than princesses; this way, the birthday girl stands out.<span style="float:left;"><a title="Cloud and rainbow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29031004@N06/3969102698/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none;" title="princess party game ideas" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2551/3969102698_79f5c2a21b_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Cloud and rainbow" width="144" height="144" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="float:left;"><a title="Cloud and rainbow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29031004@N06/3969102698/" target="_blank"></a></span>To complete the party, you will need to have plenty of princess party game ideas to keep the guests entertained.</p>
<p>How about Princess&#8217; Lost Slipper? Basically a scavenger hunt where you hide one of your daughter&#8217;s shoes and people complete tasks to be given clues as to the whereabouts. Whomever figures out where the slipper is wins!</p>

The children running away are turkeys, so must obviously not be caught by the Farmer for fear of becoming Thanksgiving dinner!</p>

Taking it in turns, each girl spins the nail polish. The person to whom the top of the polish points has to paint one of the spinner&#8217;s nails using a nail polish other than the one used to spin (get hold of a range of non-toxic, multi-colored polishes to play this game).<br />
The game continues until all of the girls&#8217; nails are covered in polish! Lots of multi-colored fun!</p>

The most obvious solution is to have some tag-type games to ensure everyone is involved. It&#8217;s good to combine games that everyone can play at once together, but also have some games available for those who may not necessarily like running around.<br />

The key point is to ensure that everyone is involved in something; you should keep an eye out for anyone who does not look engaged and get them to suggest some games that they would like to play.</p>

If you hire a professional clown, they&#8217;ll have plenty of games that will entertain the children. Getting everyone to come as their own version of a clown would be fun too!</p>

<p>One of my daughters&#8217; favorites is to do pumpkin carving. Best of all, the inside of the pumpkin could be used to make a delicious pumpkin soup or pie. Deciding whether you involve the girls in the cooking will develop on their age.</p>
<p>Telling age-appropriate scary stories is also fun, and you can&#8217;t beat getting all the girls to dress up in costumes to make the event go off with a bang!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>It&#8217;s widely accepted that little girls love pretending to be princesses.

<p>The game is called Princess Goes Shopping. Sitting in a circle, all of the girls close their eyes. In the middle, you put a sack which contains some sweets and some Disney princess party favors.</p>
<p><a title="And in this parcel..." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/82103247@N00/3846844872/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2542/3846844872_8c7ed547c6_m.jpg" border="0" alt="And in this parcel..." /></a><br />

<p>Taking turns, each girl puts one hand into the sack and pulls out a prize (it&#8217;s a good idea to have some Disney princess party favors on standby in case some girls get sweets and no Disney princess party favors!).</p>
<p>On picking out a prize, each girl has to invent a story of why she purchased that particular item. No story can be repeated, and it&#8217;s lots of fun to watch the girls try and conjure up ever-increasingly weird stories!</p>

<p>I Spy is a classic that never goes out of style. Remember that some games which may be old fashioned to you could be being played by the children for the very first time. If you like, you can spice I Spy up a bit by incorporating actions and singing.</p>
<p>Another game which should be played at a mystery party is Wink Murder. This game is so much fun, and can be adapted in so many ways to suit any theme you may be incorporating.</p>

<p>A party is a gathering of people ready to have fun. To ensure a cohesive party, I try to incorporate some team building games to solidify the group and make sure everyone is involved as much as possible.</p>

To do this, tie some material around one person&#8217;s eyes and then get the other players to give them directions to navigate the room/house. This increases understanding of issues affecting society, as well as trust in one&#8217;s team members. As such, it&#8217;s one of my favorite team building games. Get the girls to swap places. Maybe have more than one person blindfolded at a time. Mix it up and gets the girls to suggest alternatives.</p>

<p>A while ago, I searched online for some ideas for my daughter, and was really inspired by the wide selection of ladybug party supplies I found. You can Google them to see where they&#8217;re sold.</p>
<p>So, basing your party on the ladybug theme will point you in the right direction for when you decide what party games to play. The best thing about this is that you should use the ladybug party supplies that you&#8217;ve bought as inspiration for the games you then play. For example, you could have some facepaint (suitable for children) and paint the girls&#8217; faces to match the pictures on the plates. Another idea would be to play ladybug tag.</p>
<p>Use your imagination and have an awesome time!</p>

<p>This will depend on the group of children you are organizing the party for, as many girls will be fine with scarier games. However, you should bear in mind that this may not always be the case.</p>
<p>There is a huge selection of Halloween party games to choose from. The easiest way is to think of the usual games, and then adapt them so that they match the Halloween theme. For example, you could play Musical Chairs, but the music could be creepier and anyone who can&#8217;t sit down is &#8216;eaten&#8217; by a mysterious monster (i.e. taken to another room and given sweets in exchange for screaming). This is one of my daughters&#8217; favorite Halloween party games, but is age-dependant, so tread carefully!</p>

<p>A party game which my daughters love to play outside is a twist on the normal Scavenger Hunt.</p>
<p><a title="Run!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/78394307@N00/3840228857/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3487/3840228857_c495b8ae36_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Run!" /></a></p>
<p>Instead of searching for treats, each person has to find an item which has been assigned to them. The quicker they find it, the more points they get. If they find someone else&#8217;s item, they have to tell an adult who will add bonus points to their score (but they must not hide the other child&#8217;s item in a different place!).</p>
<p>Points convert into prizes.</p>

<p>Maybe they want to be fairies or princesses; maybe they want to be glamorous actresses or French models! It&#8217;s excellent preparation to buy a few metres of cheap fabric or curtain material, so the girls can make their own costumes. Have some make-up and hair styling products and accessories handy too!</p>
<p>The girls could compete to dress up in record time; maybe the other girls could decide what the chosen girl should dress up as!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>When planning a party or a play-date for girls, it’s vital that you give some thought to what <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/group-party-games" target=" " title="group party games">group party games</a> and birthday party activities can be included.</p>
<p>Not only are they are a way of keeping the girls entertained, but they also assist in teaching them social skills. They’re great for you too, as they give you a chance to focus on what else needs to be prepared for the party.</p>
<p><a title="party games for girls" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/40645538@N00/3351774095/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none;" title="Party Games For Girls" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3614/3351774095_872c6ea7f0.jpg" border="0" alt="party games for girls" width="280" height="186" /></a>Making the choice of which party games to include will depend on many factors, including (a) the guests’ ages, gender and preferences, (b) the venue, (c) whether the games are indoor party games or outdoor party games, (d) when the games will be played (e.g. a slumber party will need more games than a usual party, and not all games are suitable for <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/slumber-party-games" target=" " title="slumber party games">slumber party games</a>) and (e) whether there is a theme (e.g. a mystery theme will require mystery party games, and a princess theme will require <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/princess-party-games" target=" " title="princess party games">princess party games</a>).</p>
<p>Three golden rules to remember when planning <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com" target=" " title="party games for girls">party games for girls</a> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s often more straightforward (and easier on the purse) to hold the party at home</li>
<li>Girls love to be involved and challenged, so get them to suggest games that they want to play</li>
<li>Theme parties (where everyone comes in character) already stand out from the usual parties and are a great way to invent new party games by adapting the rules of traditional party games to suit the theme.</li>
</ul>
<p>Giving the girls a hand in creating the party will ensure that the party is unique and that the guests enjoy themselves and are engaged.</p>
<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>Each of the children has to lie down on the floor. One person is the tagger, and has to tag the other players. The twist in this version of tag is that all of the players are on the floor, on their front, and have to move like caterpillars.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a great game to play if it&#8217;s raining outside, because it doesn&#8217;t become too boisterous. My daughters loved pretending to be caterpillars too.</p>
<p>If you want the game to be played outside, maybe the players could become butterflies and have to chase each other flapping their wings!</p>

<p>To play, one child has to find something in the room or garden. Each player has to guess what the child has chosen but, instead of using words, they have to act out what they think the first child has chosen. It&#8217;s therefore a game where everyone plays throughout, rather than one where each person has a go.</p>

<p>Pass the parcel is a great game for preschoolers. It helps introduce the concept of sharing, and all children love unwrapping presents. Everyone gets a present. However, I&#8217;d make dsure you&#8217;re closeby to ensure little fingers only open only layer of wrapping paper each time!</p>

<p>My girls love baking. One of their favorites is to bake cookies in different shapes, like animals or flowers. I usually add some food coloring to make them look extra special, and the girls adore decorating them with colored frosting and edible glitter.</p>
<p>Beautiful <em>and </em>delicious!</p>

<p>&#8216;Tag&#8217; is a traditional favorite, though I find that my daughters always love playing role-playing games with a bit of physical activity. For example, sometimes they are pirates straned on an island and they have to find some buried treasure (i.e. sweets or fruit hidden by me earlier in the day) to survive. Sometimes they are stranded princesses in need of refreshment.</p>
<p>The key ingredient is that you have hidden some treats in the backyard. You can then encourage the children to let their imaginations take off!</p>

<p>My daughters love playing princess and having princess themed parties. This is a game that you can play with the guests or before the guests arrive (and which will help you organize the rest of the party!).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s generically called &#8216;Princess Decorating Games&#8217;, but basically involves the girls helping to decorate the playzone like a princess&#8217; bedroom or castle.</p>
<p><a title="A Picture of many colors proclaims images of many Thoughts." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/11767573@N02/3952383451/" target="_blank"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="Princess Decorating Games" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3462/3952383451_96d4319bef_m.jpg" border="0" alt="A Picture of many colors proclaims images of many Thoughts." width="240" height="182" /></a><br />

<p>You should supply a variety of colors of crepe papers, tissue paper, ribbons, card, marker pens, glitter and other craft items (including child-safe scissors). You then challenge the girls to create a princess wonderland with placemats, a fortress header for the front door (you should perhaps create the base for this and get the girls to decorate it).</p>
<p>The girls will have a blast and it&#8217;ll make your party venue much more unique than usual!</p>

<p>To play this game, you will need some pieces of paper and some water-based, child-friendly paint. In turn, each girl will paint the base of her foot, stand on a piece of paper and then wash her foot. The name of each girl will be written on the back of the paper.</p>
<p>Once dried, all of the girls must try and guess whose feet are whose. Be sure to include a print of your feet as well, as this adds a lot of fun because it&#8217;ll create mystery as to who the extra feet belong to!</p>

<p>One of my favorite guessing party games is &#8216;Blindfolded Monkey&#8217;. For this, you will need an eye-mask (or some fabric which is sturdy enough to act as a blindfold).</p>
<p><a title="The Monkey" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68458516@N00/3950942119/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2669/3950942119_8903a6b6e8_m.jpg" border="0" alt="The Monkey" /></a><br />

<p>Attach the blindfold to one of the girls and get the other children to stand in a circle around the blindfolded girl. Each of the partygoers must now act like monkeys and walk around the blindfolded girl in the circle.</p>
<p>When the blindfolded girl says &#8216;Monkey Monkey&#8217;, the girls must stop walking and act like monkeys on the spot. The task of the blindfolded girl is to guess the identities of as many monkeys as possible.</p>

<p>There are sometimes so many activities to choose from that it can be quite overwhelming.</p>
<p>However, one of my favorites (and one of the more successful) home <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/birthday-party-activities" target=" " title="birthday party activities">birthday party activities</a> is to play &#8216;Simon Says&#8217;.</p>
<p><a title="Tug-o-war" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36946048@N05/3701419549/" target="_blank"><img style="border: 0pt none;" title="Home Birthday Party Activities" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2542/3701419549_1fc079fd7f_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Tug-o-war" width="240" height="212" /></a><br />

<p>The &#8216;Simon&#8217; part can be replaced by the name of the birthday girl, and is played in the traditional way (i.e. the child wil say &#8220;[Name] say to do&#8230;&#8221;, and everyone follows; should the birthday girl say &#8220;Do&#8230;&#8221; without saying their name first, everyone who follows these instructions loses).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve amended the rules before to include &#8216;Speedy Simon Says&#8217;, where everything is done very quickly; this is lots of fun and one you should try.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>If you&#8217;ve got girls staying over for a slumber party, it&#8217;s a great idea to include some slumber party crafts to keep them entertained. Activities where children get involved are much better than activities where children are passive (e.g. just watching a dvd).</p>
<p>The great thing about slumber parties is that they can be longer than normal parties, so there&#8217;s more choice of which crafts you can include.</p>
<p><a title="disco feva!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87457515@N00/3958149550/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2613/3958149550_74d23b46cd_m.jpg" border="0" alt="disco feva!" /></a><br />

<p>Cooking crafts are great for slumber parties, as they&#8217;ll let you bake some cookies or other treats to snack on later. I&#8217;ve also had pillow crafts, where each girl is given a new (freshly washed) pillowcase, some fabric paint and markers, and allowed to decorate the pillowcase that will cover the pillow they will sleep on. This should be done early enough to ensure that the paint dries fully.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>If you&#8217;re planning a party and there will be some toddlers there (or if your party is for toddlers), you&#8217;ll need to make sure that you include some indoor toddler party games.</p>
<p><a title="Elias - Sept 2009" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/19059109@N00/3938692115/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none;" title="Indoor Toddler Party Games" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3527/3938692115_49f41cc84f.jpg" border="0" alt="Elias - Sept 2009" width="350" height="232" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s best to keep these games as simple as possible, so that the rules can be easily followed.</p>
<p>One of my favorites is &#8216;Silent Mice&#8217;. It&#8217;s a bit like &#8216;Musical Statues&#8217;. Play some music and get the children to squeak and jump or roll around like mice. When you stop the music, all of the players must be as quiet and still as possible.</p>
<p>You can either make the loser of each round sit out, or let them join in as a different animal. This keeps them involved.</p>

<p>With my girls, I prefer incorporating games to DVD after DVD, for two reasons. Firstly, they can watch DVDs any time. Secondly, the interaction and fun they have with games is much higher than by watching a DVD. For this reason, I&#8217;d suggest playing a DVD only towards the end of the night to help them fall asleep.</p>

<p>My girls adore play-acting. Therefore, at their slumber parties, each girl is assigned an identity for a portion of the night. If the girls are enjoying it, we then let them choose new identities that everyone has to guess. The person who manages to keep their identity concealed (whilst still acting and talking in their identity, not just by keeping quiet!) wins, and can choose the next game. This ensures all the girls are involved and having fun.</p>

<p>On of our favorites is the Reverse Princess game. In this, prizes are given to those girls who are most un-princesslike (i.e. how they are dressed, their posture, their accents, their behavior). The Princess game follows this, where the girls do the opposite.</p>
<p>Not only is it really fun for the girls to see the difference in their friends, it also allows them to appreciate how their behavior and actions impact on others.</p>

<p>The mystery could revolve around who ted-napped the teddy or where the group will be going on a trip or where the birthday cake is.</p>

<p>You could give the partygoers instructions before they arrive at the party as to what the mystery is and what they have to figure out. Maybe everyone has a piece of the clue, and everyone else has to get as many of these as possible. Perhaps the girls are only allowed to ask each other questions in a specified character or do so avoiding a particular word (or words beginning with a particular letter).</p>
<p>The options are pretty endless. I&#8217;ve found it really entertaining to have my girls figure out what they would like the mystery to be. This makes the party really unique and means they&#8217;ll remember it for years to come.</p>

<p>This site is crammed full of ideas for <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com" target=" " title="party games for girls">party games for girls</a>; but not all of our suggestions involve games. Lots of our suggestions involve craft activities too.</p>
<p>An excellent way to ensure the party you&#8217;re planning is different from the (many!) others your guests will go to is to involve some crafts and activities. These can range from baking and dressing up teddy bears to painting pictures, decorating a wall in your garage or decorating a tree in your yard.</p>
<p><a title="City Market Muffins" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37862156@N00/3927122508/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2445/3927122508_4732254f5a_m.jpg" border="0" alt="City Market Muffins" /></a><br />

<p>If your party has a theme, the crafts and activities can be centred around it. You could even have a playdate set in advance that all the guests can come to where they make their own costumes that they&#8217;ll wear to the party the following week. You can ask the other moms to supply their daughter with the necessary materials, or you could go through your closet and find clothing you never wear.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about engaging the children&#8217;s interests and inspiring them.</p>

<p>These allow the partygoers to engage with each other and develop social skills.</p>
<p>When considering what <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/group-party-games" target=" " title="group party games">group party games</a> to include, you should bear in mind the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you&#8217;re including sporty games, some children might not be so good at sports, so you should try and think of ways that everyone can feel involved and able to win (maybe as part of a team where their special skill is needed by the whole team)</li>
<li>early exclusion games (whereby someone loses towards the beginning of the game and has to sit out) should not make up the majority of the games &#8211; it&#8217;s better to have a high turnover of games so that everyone can be involved as much as possible</li>
<li>the games that will be enjoyed most are those that the children have helped contribute to, so think of ways they can contribute to the running or judging of the game (whether by choosing rules or catching cheaters, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p><a title="Bad shopping day" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36514345@N00/3518555635/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3337/3518555635_0ab185afa0_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Bad shopping day" /></a><br />

<p>One of our favorite group party games is The Shopping List game where everyone adds something to the shopping list and it is repeated by everyone in the circle. This can be made more fun by allowing the children to add an action or sing part of the shopping list. Best of all: let the children determine how the rules should be changed!</p>

<p>Allowing the partygoers to play outside in your yard (or a park, properly supervised), will give you some time to organize things inside. It also means that when the children return inside, they&#8217;ll be a bit more tired and less likely to run around inside too! Not only that, but it will get them to enjoy some physical exercise.</p>
<p>Choosing which games to play should be easy. You could ask the partygoers what they want to play, or you could use the following idea as a start.</p>
<p><a title="DSC_0254" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7484274@N06/3882206561/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2456/3882206561_3aef41f5ef_m.jpg" border="0" alt="DSC_0254" /></a><br />

<p>Stuck In The Mud is a great way to get everyone running around and enjoying themselves. Basically, one person is the Tagger at the start, and must try and tag everyone else in the group. If the Tagger touches another person, that person is &#8216;stuck&#8217; until another free person runs under their arm or between their legs to free them. If the Tagger gets everyone, she wins.</p>
<p>An interesting alternate version is where, if someone has been &#8216;stuck&#8217; three times, on the fourth time, they also become a Tagger.</p>

<p>Deciding whether to include some <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/indoor-party-games" target=" " title="indoor party games">indoor party games</a> into the party you are planning will depend on several factors, including the chosen theme, the desires of the partygirl and the weather.</p>
<p><a title="fast" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7941044@N06/2682800311/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3008/2682800311_0711f6564d_m.jpg" border="0" alt="fast" width="160" height="240" /></a></p>
<p>Just because the party games are to be played inside doesn&#8217;t mean they have to be subdued and boring games. Games such as musical chairs, musical statues and hide and seek can all be played inside. Any game which is ordinarily played outside can have its rules altered to allow it to be played inside.</p>
<p>Take a game such as &#8216;tag&#8217;. Usually, this should be played outside, but if the rules of the game require the children to speak and pursue in slow motion, it can be played inside. Anyone breaching the rules has to sit out.</p>
<p>The best thing about adapting games so they are suitable to become <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/indoor-party-games" target=" " title="indoor party games">indoor party games</a>, is that the children can be involved in determining how the rules should change &#8211; this will make them more likely to stick to the rules and also engages them with the party.</p>

<p>You will need five scraps of paper per girl and a container.</p>
<p>Using the scraps of paper, each girl writes down the names of five famous people or other people known to all of the group. The scraps are then folded up and put into the container.</p>
<p><a title="oh what fun" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/14012543@N04/2369710781/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3185/2369710781_b4632d6b24_m.jpg" border="0" alt="oh what fun" /></a><br />

<p>The girls will need to be divided into two groups, with just one girl in each group (at a time) taking a name from the container. This girl will need to give her team members clues as to what name she has, without saying the name. When the other members of her team have guessed the name, the next person in the team takes a name from the container, and so on.</p>
<p>Both teams play at the same time, until all of the names are used. The team which guesses the most names wins.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Parties are all about having fun. Because of this, it&#8217;s always fun to incorporate some silly party games into the list of games you plan to play.</p>
<p>One of these is the Emotions Game.</p>
<p><a title="Smile" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33986404@N00/3513706834/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3405/3513706834_7ea3f6be7e_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Smile" /></a><br />

<p>To play this game, one person will need to leave the room, while the other girls decide on an emotion. When the person returns to the room, each of the girls have to pose, sing, dance or act that emotion. The aim of the game is for the person who left the room to guess the emotion.</p>
<p>Each of the girls can take it in turns to be the person leaving the room. Obviously, the more rounds of the game that are played, the harder and more funny it gets!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Ok, so not all girls like being princesses. But, even if they do, not all pirates have to be male and wear patches&#8230;</p>
<p>A fun party where both girls <em>and </em>boys are coming is to have a pirate theme. For this, you will need some pirate <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/birthday-party-activities" target=" " title="birthday party activities">birthday party activities</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe the birthday girl is the Captain of the Ship. Obviously, games like treasure hunt and &#8216;find the ticking clock before the alarm rings&#8217; are good fun, but one that&#8217;s also fun is Walk The Plank To Safety.</p>
<p><a title="Windy. Aarrrr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/99139484@N00/3572364633/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3587/3572364633_8cdb130933_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Windy. Aarrrr" /></a><br />

<p>For this game, draw a plank on the ground with chalk and blindfold each child in turn. The aim is for the child to walk in a straight line and reach the other side without &#8216;falling off&#8217;. Along each side of the plank, the other children can stand with squirt bottles, pretending to be crocodiles. If the plank-walker &#8216;falls off&#8217; the plank, the other children can squirt them.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Kids&#8217; parties can get a little crazy sometimes! One way to make this look as though this was the aim (!) is to give your party a princess party circus theme.</p>
<p><a title="2009-08-23 München, Kinderzirkus Lilalu 007" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28577026@N02/3850112012/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2488/3850112012_9013f3586e_m.jpg" border="0" alt="2009-08-23 München, Kinderzirkus Lilalu 007" /></a><br />

<p>This is a wide theme which doesn&#8217;t restrict all of the attendees into coming as princesses (particularly useful if you have some boys coming too).</p>
<p>It also increases the numbers of games that can be played. Who wants to play Big Scary Lion? Who wants to play Clown Tag? All sorts of everyday games can be varied into the circus theme. And the best thing is that the children can decide what everyday games they want to play (which they then decide how to be made into a circus theme).</p>
<p>Big Scary Lion is a circus version of &#8216;what&#8217;s the time, mr wolf?&#8217; and Clown Tag is a circus version of regular tag (but with people running like clowns &#8211; unless, of course, you find clowns scary&#8230;)!</p>

<p>Either in advance of the party (to allow the girls to come in fancy-dress) or at the start of the party, give each girl the name of a character that they have to play during the party (e.g. variations of famous singers or actors).</p>

<p>Each girl will also need their own secret which you can give them on the day or which they can make up.</p>
<p>Using their character, each girl must try to find out as many of the other girls&#8217; secrets as possible.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>This is one of the funniest indoor icebreaker games we&#8217;ve come across.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one we made up (and have tested over and over again!) called Princess Witch Diva.</p>
<p><a title="Caireles sonriente" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/10459444@N06/1042286886/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1384/1042286886_b76aa17e16_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Caireles sonriente" /></a><br />

<p>This game is a lot like scissors/papers/stones, but it&#8217;s a lot more dramatic and a great way for a new group of girls to relax around each other.</p>
<p>On the count of three (or when suitable music is stopped), all of the girls pose as a princess, a witch or a diva. The Princess beats the Witch, the Witch beats the Diva and the Diva beats the Princess. Keep going until all the girls are out!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>One of the classic <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/indoor-party-games" target=" " title="indoor party games">indoor party games</a> for kids is musical chairs. How many of us have <em>not </em>played it?!</p>
<p>Set out some pairs of chairs (or pairs of cushions on the floor) in a line, with one less seat than the number of girls playing. Play some music and have the girls dance around the seat. When the music stops, the girls must rush to sit down and the one who&#8217;s last is out. On each round, one of the seats is removed until just two girls are playing for the one seat.</p>
<p><a title="RAZR iTunes" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035655291@N01/133319324/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/55/133319324_8f18e41f03_m.jpg" border="0" alt="RAZR iTunes" /></a><br />

<p>It&#8217;s good to incorporate some variations on this tried and tested game to make it unique to your party/theme.</p>
<p>One way of doing this is to allow the girl who was not able to sit to challenge one of the seated girls to a dance-off or sing-off, which can be judged by the other girls (maybe as to who was the best singer/dancer, or who was most like the artist whose song was sung/danced to). The winner will then be allowed to sit down.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Traditionally, outdoor youth games are for youth groups and are designed to cater for larger groups of children. A game which involves everyone is a fun way of uniting the group.</p>
<p>One game is RED ROVER RED ROVER. To play this, the group will need to be divided into equal (or near equal) groups.</p>
<p>Each group stands in a line and takes turns in shouting &#8220;red rover red rover&#8221;. The first person in the line of the shouting group then names someone on the other team. As soon as that person&#8217;s name is shouted, they have to run towards the shouting group and try and break through their line.</p>
<p>The other side does the same, and each side takes turns, working along the line so everyone gets a chance to shout someone&#8217;s name. Whichever side gets all their team through wins.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great way to learn people&#8217;s names and to get everyone ready for some quieter games later!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A relatively calming game to include in your slumber party ideas is the straw-marshmallow game.</p>
<p>It can either be played in two teams sitting opposite each other or by all girls together sitting in a circle.</p>
<p>Everyone puts a drinking straw in their mouth and the first person sticks a marshmallow onto the end. The aim of the game is to pass the marshmallow around the circle (or down the line) using only the drinking straws in your mouth.</p>
<p>Ways to make this harder are for the girls to have a marshmallow in their mouth (or a mouthful!) while trying to pass the other marshmallow.</p>
<p>If the girls don&#8217;t like marshmallows (or you would like to do something healthier), maybe try passing strawberries!</p>

On the ground, use the chalk to mark out a grid measuring at least four square by four squares. Each square should be large enough for a girl to stand in.</p>
<p>Then use dice (or a large box painted like a dice) to roll numbers. Each girl will roll the dice individually and will move the corresponding number of spaces. Each sqaure will have a task or an action which the landing girl will have to perform &#8211; these can be decided by you in advance, or the girls could put their ideas into a hat for you to reveal when each girl rolls the dice! Lots of fun!</p>

<p>You could even send recipes to each girl in advance, maybe based on the theme on the party. You then get each of the other girls to guess what the ingredients are or what the shapes of the food are supposed to represent. You could maybe even have the food around the theme of a famous story, which the girls have to piece together. Food is fun and you don&#8217;t always need the sun!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Not all parties will have a lot of attendees. Party games can be amended depending on how many girls will be there.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an idea which can be amended to provide several small <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/group-party-games" target=" " title="group party games">group party games</a>.</p>
<p>A great way of entertaining girls where there are not many of them is to include some adults in the games. One of our favorites is the pharoah mummy! Using a bag of fabric rags, the girls will compete (either in teams or individually) to see who can mummify the adult in their team the fastest. You can switch mummies and award prizes based on speed, lengths of rags used or whatever you can think of!</p>

<p>Each of the girls will need to write down interesting facts about their character (the number of interesting facts will need to be equal to the number of other girls playing the game). These facts will then need to be distributed to the girls so that each girl has one fact about each of the other characters (i.e. if there are ten girls playing, then each girl will need one fact about each of the other nine girls).</p>
<p>The girls will then have to act in their characters to try and get the missing facts about themselves before any of the other characters do.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Guessing party games are lots of fun and a great ice-breaker.</p>
<p>One of our favorite guessing party games is Wink Diva Drama Queen. This may sound similar to wink murder, but a lot less blood is spilled in this version!</p>
<p>One of the girls is chosen as the Casting Agent, and she leaves the room. The rest of the girls stand in a large circle, facing outwards with their eyes closed.</p>
<p>An adult walks around the circle and touches one of the girls on the shoulder. This girl is the Director, but the other girls do not know which one of them is the Director.</p>
<p>The aim of the Director is to wink at each of the other girls in the circle before the Casting Agent finds out who the Director is.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/65561583@N00/3612750852/" title="Japanese Tea Garden San Francisco" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3610/3612750852_1cbdb9f1f4_m.jpg" alt="Japanese Tea Garden San Francisco" border="0" /></a><br /><small><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" title="Attribution License" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" alt="Creative Commons License" border="0" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/65561583@N00/3612750852/" title="Donna &#038; Andrew" target="_blank">Donna &#038; Andrew</a></small></p>
<p>The girls face each other and the Casting Agent stands in the middle of the girls.</p>
<p>When winked at, each girl must act as though they are a diva drama queen, before falling to floor, sobbing and then sitting, waiting for the other girls to be winked at. It&#8217;s therefore a competition between the Director and the Casting Agent. Sooo much fun!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Three great ways play a fun princess dress up game are to have the girls trying to look like (a) the best princess ever, (b) the worst princess ever or (c) a combination of both.</p>

<p>It would be a great idea to have a few bags of clothes or fabric samples so the girls can put together their own outfits, along with some hair clips, hair ties and glitter make-up. A way to inject fun is to give the girls five minutes to put their best princess &#8216;look&#8217; together; and then to give them two minutes to get them to put their worst princess &#8216;look&#8217; together.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s fun to not tell them about the second task; be sure to have a video camera closeby for their responses!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>A theme that is always popular with girls is to have a tea birthday party.</p>
<p>Although it might seem obvious that tea is needed, this is not so, as a tea birthday party is characterized by having adult-type food and drink in child-friendly (and tasty!) portions. You could even spice it up by having an Alice in Wonderland theme with fancy dress.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035626656@N01/2338654569/" title="IMG_0296.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2166/2338654569_41e08d548a_m.jpg" alt="IMG_0296.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /><small><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/" title="Attribution-ShareAlike License" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" alt="Creative Commons License" border="0" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/51035626656@N01/2338654569/" title="ste3ve" target="_blank">ste3ve</a></small></p>
<p>If the girls coming to your party don&#8217;t like tea, why not make some fruity drinks which make it look they&#8217;re drinking tea? Naturally, these are served from a tea pot. Small sandwiches, cakes, fruit and other treats are also made to accompany the &#8216;tea&#8217;.</p>
<p>These parties are particularly suitable for girly girls, so the party games you hold should bear this in mind.</p>

<p>Depending on how boisterous the girls are, you can organize hide and seek games, lost and found games, water balloon games, etc. It&#8217;s also a great chance to have the girls get involved in cooking some healthy and brightly colored foods (like peppers, crazily-topped pizzas and exotic fruits).</p>
<p>Some ghost stories can be exchanged in the tent before bedtime (obviously age-dependant ones!), and the girls can either stay in the tent(s) or watch a dvd voted on by them all inside. Great memorable fun!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Girls have lots of fun playing party word games, and here&#8217;s one which is guaranteed to be fun.</p>
<p>Divide the girls into two teams and sit them opposite each other in two rows so each girl is facing one other girl. If there are an odd number of girls, the extra girl will sit at the head of the rows.</p>
<p>Each girl must try to get the girl opposite her to say one word from a particular list of words (maybe based on the party&#8217;s theme). Whichever row has the largest number of girls able to make her opponent say one of the words wins!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27324323@N03/3814382893/" title="love" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2544/3814382893_cb85db9637_m.jpg" alt="love" border="0" /></a><br /><small><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/" title="Attribution-NoDerivs License" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" alt="Creative Commons License" border="0" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27324323@N03/3814382893/" title="courtney____" target="_blank">courtney____</a></small></p>
<p>If there&#8217;s an odd number of girls, the remaining girl can choose who to play against after everyone has played. She could therefore change the outcome of which team wins!</p>

<p>Slumber parties are usually strictly girls only. Depending on how old the girls are, suitable movies can be watched, accompanied with treats made specially (maybe by some of the girls together during the day; or maybe by each girl bringing something different for everyone else to share).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always fun to let the girls go crazy with some make-up and hair styles (appropriately overseen as necessary). Fashion shows and catwalks, whether they be of teddys or the girls themselves,<br />
is another way for the girls to have a blast!</p>

<p>However, it really depends on the preferences of the girls at the party and the type of survivor party games that are played.</p>
<p>If the girls don&#8217;t mind getting dirty and running about, some team games that pitch them against the other side are a great way for them to have fun (and exhaust themselves!).</p>

<p>If the girls are more reserved, then why not let them suggest ways in which they could be survivors? They could be pop starlets singing or dancing in American Idol style eliminations; they could be solving cryptic clues!</p>

<p>Girls simply love role playing and getting into character, so the script could either be a full length script or short enough to give the girls an idea of what their character is like. This will then allow them to be as imaginative as possible; making it fun for everyone!</p>
<p>A box of old clothes and fabrics is a great way to let the girls accessorize their new characters, and it&#8217;s completely up to you what the actual mystery is. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to focus on the girls creating their characters, rather than worry about coming up with a mystery. If you&#8217;re stuck, perhaps one of the girls is really a princess or has been selected to go to ballet or rap school!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Girls really enjoy helping to organize a party. Getting them to help put together birthday party crafts is a great way to make the party unique <em>and</em> give you time to focus on other aspects of the party.</p>
<p>The crafts can be table decorations, name badges, pictures to decorate a room, party bag covers; the list is endless!</p>
<p>Essential supplies would be plenty of colored paper, non-toxic glue, appropriate scissors and lots of glitter! It&#8217;s also a good idea to have some sparkly paper which the girls can cut to make shapes or letters.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33986404@N00/3611844394/" title="Beading" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2452/3611844394_55502a58dc_m.jpg" alt="Beading" border="0" /></a><br /><small><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/" title="Attribution License" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" alt="Creative Commons License" border="0" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33986404@N00/3611844394/" title="tiffanywashko" target="_blank">tiffanywashko</a></small></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll probably want to provide aprons for the girls and coverings for the tables/floors where the crafts are being made.</p>
<p>Be sure to include some time for the actual party though!</p>

<p>Each girl will be given the chance to swim as much like a mermaid as possible. However, it&#8217;s up to each mermaid to decide the character of their mermaid and to get into character!</p>
<p>The contest can be judged by the adult supervisors or by all the mermaids collectively. This is probably the best option because all girls get to participate in deciding who wins. Let the best Mermaid win!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Come rain or shine, a picnic party is great fun. A key ingredient to their success is incorporating cool picnic party games to keep the girls entertained.</p>
<p>The sorts of games that can be played will depend on whether your picnic party is being held indoors or outdoors. Girls whose birthdays are in the fall or winter sometimes miss out on being able to have their own picnic party; this need not be the case (and will definitely be a party everyone will remember!).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/20119917@N04/3848327720/" title="" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3435/3848327720_551b076699_m.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><small><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/" title="Attribution-NoDerivs License" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.partygamesforgirls.com/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" alt="Creative Commons License" border="0" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/20119917@N04/3848327720/" title="m,!" target="_blank">m,!</a></small></p>
<p>A great idea is to hide some prizes at various places around the house (or garden) and to give the girls clues to find the prizes. The clues and prizes can match the sort of picnic you are throwing, whether it be a traditional teddy bear&#8217;s picnic or a fairy twinkle toes picnic with tag games and sticky chicken wings! Let your imagination go wild!</p>

<p>There are many ways a dance party can be organized, on every kind of budget. There could be a theme (like High School Musical or fairy garden princesses!) that the girls choose beforehand. The theme would give the girls a chance to start enjoying the party before it happens (and makes it much easier to keep them entertained!). Or the party could be themeless, with some fun songs chosen by the girls (and played by a DJ &#8211; or mom and dad!).</p>
<p>Let the dancing begin!</p>

<p>A fairly easy and inexpensive way to ensure each stop on the treasure hunt is suitable for everyone is to have candy as the treasure.</p>
<p><a title="Sabores" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/38804287@N07/3804633122/" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2450/3804633122_32f148e11c_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Sabores" /></a><br />

<p>The players can either eat the candy as they go or trade the candy in for a suitable prize at the end. The players who eat fewer candies will benefit the most; perhaps even a great way to combat our growing childhood obesity problems!</p>
