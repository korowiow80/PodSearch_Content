<h2>So what is “F**k It” about?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, if someone asked me to describe it in four words, my answer would be, “just say F**k it.” This is not really a revolutionary concept, considering that that was my motto in school and the university. People throughout the world &#8211; maybe even you &#8211; go through a lot of s**t, and they start blaming the world, themselves, other people for all bad that’s happening to them. John Parkin suggests a very simple, an incredibly simple solution – just say “F**k it” to all your problems.</p>
<p>There are things in the world that aren’t entirely under our control – the weather, how people will treat us today, break ups, drivers who cut you off in traffic, etc. One solution would be to go mad and utilize your curse words vocabulary; the other one is to accept what happened, feel a sense of frustration and just move on. The world won’t get any better by you bitching about it.</p>
<h2>I recommend you check out this video:</h2>
<p><iframe width="500" height="284" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0z29W1IYNus" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>and pay attention to the part where Rocky, played by Sylvester Stallone, speaks about the world and how you must learn to take punches that it gives. His</p>
<h1 class="wslHeader">motivating words</h1>
<p>set up a great foundation for a fulfilling life.</p>
<p>The philosophy of “F**k It” teaches us the perspective to know when something is really in the crapper, and when your situation is not as bad as it looks. For example, if your only concern is not knowing</p>
<h1 class="wslHeader">how to motivate yourself to study</h1>
<p>and being afraid to fail in college, imagine that somewhere in the world there are people who are going through hell about losing someone they loved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Bad Sides Of This Book</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do my best to not blame anyone for my bad days, and I try to face problems that aren’t under my control with an ironic smile. <strong>But what about the problems that we can, actually, solve by being proactive? </strong></p>
<p>In “F**k it” Jon Parkin makes an argument for keeping getting fat if that’s what you really want. That’s right. He recommends you say “f**k it” to your diets, other people’s opinions, some BS appearance standards that were forced into our throats, and eventually you will start eating healthy stuff not because “you have to,” but because “you want to.” Personally, I really find that hard to believe.</p>
<p>What about drug users (I’m not talking about you pot smokersJ)?  Should they also continue sticking needles in their veins? I mean, it’s what their body wants, right? Under John Parkin’s logic (sorry if I misunderstood something), all the addicts will stop taking drugs eventually. I say that’s Bulls**t.</p>
<h2>Motivation and Discipline</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chapter about motivation was the one I was interested the most. Many people (including me) always wanted to find motivation by reading</p>
<h1 class="wslHeader">self-motivation quotes</h1>
<p>that some famous people stated. My goal was always to become rich, famous and just fabulous. I know that I have it in me, but the journey to this goal is painful and full of frustrations. Even now, as I’m writing this sentence, I’m feeling somewhat depressed and sad because it seems that no matter what I try, the world says “F**k you, I will give the money to some crappy singer like Nicki Minaj.”</p>
<p>“F**k it“ tells us just to let all the tension and frustration go. You will either get rich or not and there is nothing you can do about it. You just have to “go with the flow.” I, personally, think that that’s Bulls**t. <strong>From nothing comes nothing</strong>; and while there are plenty of exception to that rule, in most cases you have to fight to get something that you want.</p>
<p><strong>But what do we want?</strong> What do I want? My goal was always to become rich. But why? I want to be financially independent, but do I really need millions or billions? Money is nothing more than paper and numbers unless you spend it on something that makes you happy. If I have much more money than me and my family can spend, what use would that be?</p>
<h2>Reaching Goals</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I liked the point that John Parkin made about reaching goals. If I understood him correctly, his philosophy is that goals are bulls**t because you plan them based on the map of the world you currently have.</p>
<p>The world is more than you know and understand, and maybe you are missing out on something more fun and rewarding while chasing dreams of other people.</p>
<p>Here is an article that perfectly fits into this philosophy:</p>
<p><a href="http://zenhabits.net/no-goal/">the best goal is no goal</a></p>
<p>I’m not a brave person, because I’m often afraid to step out of my comfort zone. I guess, once I step through that hurdle, many doors will open for me. That was probably the idea that motivated me and made this book worthwhile. To not be afraid to leave something in the hands of God (or fate) and set a huge portion of your life on auto-pilot can really turn into a fantastic adventure.</p>
<p>What do you think? Is saying “F**k it” to your problems a wise decision or will it bite you in the a**?</p>
