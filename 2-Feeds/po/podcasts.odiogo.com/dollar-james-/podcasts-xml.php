      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">What one might have noticed, is that it has become more and more difficult to earn money online with blogs or websites due to increased competition on most popular keywords.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today, there is actually no point in spending all of your time on writing hundreds of articles and trying to get thousands of backlinks for only a few dollars. Why should you waste doing so much effort for nothing ? Ok maybe a few years ago there were still some opportunities, but today all of this is over and it&#8217;s getting really difficult to to get well positionned on Google.This is particularly true for the english market, where all popular sectors &amp; topics are already covered by thousands of SEO competitive websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nevertheless there is a solution in order to make a solid online income very easily and on a regular basis. The solution is called <strong>niche blogging</strong>. <strong>Niche blogging</strong> consists in writing about specific topics which are far less competitive, but still have a decent amount of traffic. A <strong>niche topic</strong> could be a topic about specific brand products. For example instead of writing about gardening, you could write about specific gardening tools. Basically these are the long tail keywords. <a title="Google Keyword tool" href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal" target="_blank">Google Keyword tool</a> can help you find these keywords.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want even less competition, you should write in other languages such as german or french. I have several websites on french niche topics. For example I have a website on <a title="Faux Ongles" href="http://www.faux-ongles.org" target="_blank">Faux Ongles</a> (Fake Nails) and a brand new one on <a title="Faux Cils" href="http://www.faux-cils.net" target="_blank">Faux Cils</a> (fake eyelashes). No worry if you don&#8217;t speak that language, you can either translate english content to french using translation tools, or better you can even pay a small amount to someone who will translate your text in the language you want. This is generally not expensive. For those interested, I can translate their english to french for a very cheap price if they include a backling to my niche websites.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once your <strong>niche websites</strong> are online, that you have a few quality backlinks, you can easily appear on first page of google for many keywords. Then ad a few google adsense slots on your websites using the tips I gave you in my previous. After a few months, you will be earning a decent amount of <strong>money</strong>, and you&#8217;ll be gald to see that it&#8217;s that easy!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Many bloggers earn money through the well known Google Adsense program. Willing to increase their revenues rapidly, most of the bloggers tend to think about SEO and link building but tend to forget the basics.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have a decent amount of trafic, before trying to get more trafic and money through Google Adsense, you should analyse your website and see how you could improve your <strong>Adsense CTR</strong> and earnings.This step is actually quite easy and can considerably improve your Adsense click through rate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The best solution in order to <strong>improve your Adsense click through rate</strong>, is to test different ad placements and different ad formats. For example you could put your Adsense underneath the title of your blog, or on the left menu of your website. Each website is different, so don&#8217;t think that what you read online is valid for your website. By doing a few tests on one of my website I managed to double my click through rate and my earnings from this site.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another solution is to use a click heatmap software such as <a title="Click Heat" href="http://www.labsmedia.com/clickheat/index.html" target="_blank">Clickheat</a> on your website to see where people tend to click. Once you have found out where people click the most, simply put an Adsense unit ad. And guess what ? your adense CTR will considerably increase! It&#8217;s as easy as that.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Everyone surfing online must have used at one moment or another Google Maps, in order to find out where you have to go! For a lot of us, Google Maps has become an essential and useful tool.  You can see where you have to go, your itinerary, the time it will take you to get there. You can also find out what are the points of interest next to your holiday hotel, or simply walk through the streets using the cool street view feature.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For hotel chains, Google maps has also become an essential tool. If your hotel is incorrectly situated, you may loose a large number of visitors. Unfortunately for hotel managers, visitors tend to rely too much on Google Maps, and dont always check that the information provided by Google is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here is a brilliant example of the power of Google Maps. If you want a wonderful cheap hotel in Paris, why not stay under the eiffel tower! Yes, this is true, Google Maps does show a hotel under the eiffel tower! Just type &#8220;formule1 tour eiffel&#8221; under the french google maps and you will find the hotel! Actually if you go on the street view, it seems the hotel is actually the Eiffel Tower!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Do you want to <strong>make money online</strong> ? I know how to, and I can help you! This is no BS, what I am offering is something real which I am going to explain right now. The idea came to me today while I was surfing on <a title="Search Engine Land" href="http://www.searchengineland.com" target="_blank">searchengineland.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you know I can easily make money online with websites on <strong>niche markets</strong>. I actually make between €30 and €120 euros per month on some of my websites and regularly receive Google <strong>Adsense</strong> cheques. Meanwhile I would really like to make even more money. For this I need to have more time, which I dont have unfortunately and which is the reason why I dont have so much time to write on my blog lately.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today I had this bright idea. I know how to find niche markets, I know SEO as its my job, I know how to get popular, I know how to turn my website in something profitable, BUT I want to make even more money. I have actually found how, and guess what ? You will <strong>make money online with m</strong>e also!!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Yes its by working with you readers and webmasters that it will work. By sharing our work and knowledge all together we will all make money together. The concept is quite simple. I will do part of the work, by finding niche markets for us. I will create my website on a particular niche market to show you how to optimize it for SEO (which keywords &amp; best practices) and to show you what sort of template to use. For example, when I use a template like <a title="Zyoptix Lasik surgery" href="http://www.zyoptixlaser.com" target="_blank">Zyoptix Laser eye surgery</a> I can get a very high CTR. You will also therefore have some quality content in order to understand what the niche is about. Once this is done, I will submit the niche market to the people following me on my twitter account (DollarJames), so that they can start creating websites on that same niche. Together we will be able to create a network of websites on the same topic. We can do linking, which is good for SEO, we can exchange websites where we can get backlinks. All of this all together!</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Doing this will enable our websites to become popular very quickly by being well ranked in Google. Furthermore, a buzz could be created around our websites and how much money we are making with them. And the more traffic we have the more money we will make as I will help you have a good CTR.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Post a comment if you are willing to make money with me, and add me on Twitter, my username is &#8220;DollarJames&#8221;.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Make Money Online with a simple website ? Many of the top bloggers online tend to say and think that making money online with a website requires you to have a good looking design and some quality content. Even though having a nice looking website or blog does allow you to get decent traffic and money, it is not necessary  in order to make money online.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A few weeks ago, the <a title="ABC NetMarketing" href="http://www.abc-netmarketing.com" target="_blank">e-marketing B2B teacher</a> from my <a title="Blog MBA MCI e-business" href="http://www.blogmci.com" target="_blank">e-business MBA course</a>, showed us one of his websites (in french) which earns him about $200 a month with Google Adsense. He has accumulated around $10000 in 4 years. This is not huge, but considering the look of his website and the small efforts put into it, we can say that the ROI is really high.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">His website, <a title="Veranda Conseils" href="http://www.veranda-conseils.com" target="_blank">Veranda Conseils</a>, is a simple HTML website with only a couple of pages. No background, no images, just plain text with Google Adsense. The question is how does he make money with such a website ? In fact he has been very intelligent, choosing his domain and keywords carefully where there was little competition in order to be ranked for many keywords on the first page of Google. In fact he has carefully optimized his website for search engines (SEO) and created just a few quality backlinks in order to get well ranked under Google. I will not talk about his SEO strategy today, but I invite you to come and visit my blog in the next few days as I will be analyzing his website in details and will be giving useful SEO tips.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Being a competitive person, I launched <a title="Veranda Conseils" href="http://www.verandaconseils.com" target="_blank">VerandaConseils.com</a> in order to compete against his website. I am currently ranked 2nd just behind him for the keywords <a title="Veranda Conseils" href="http://www.verandaconseils.com" target="_blank">Veranda Conseils</a> on the french Google search engine. I still need to work on optimizing my website for keywords such as <a title="Prix Veranda" href="http://www.verandaconseils.com/prix-veranda.htm" target="_blank">prix veranda</a>. I will keep you updated on wether I can beat him or not.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">While surfing today on <a title="Rajaie Talks Blog" href="http://www.rajaietalks.com/top-internet-marketing-blogs" target="_blank">Rajaie Talks blog</a>, I saw one of his articles about a project launched by Gyutae Park from <a title="Winning the Web" href="http://www.winningtheweb.com" target="_blank">Winning The Web</a>. The project is in fact a ranking of the <strong><a title="WTW Top Internet Marketing Blogs" href="http://www.winningtheweb.com/im-top-blogs/" target="_blank">Top Internet Marketing blogs</a></strong>. Of course, being curious I went and had a look. I was quickly suprised to see that the ranking is in fact very reliable and that it is therefore a great source to find quality blogs to go and visit.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What can really be appreciated is that the ranking takes into consideration several reliable elements: the number of RSS subscribers, Alexa ranking, Compete rankings, Technorati rankings but also the Google Page rank, number of inbound links, the number of stumble upon reviews, the amount of del.icio.us saves and the amount of backlinks. From these elements, points are awarded to the blogs in order to have a ranking. As you can see it is an extremely complete and accurate ranking.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.winningtheweb.com/im-top-blogs/"><img class="aligncenter" title="Top Internet Marketing blogs" src="http://www.rajaietalks.com/wp-content/uploads/topblogs.png" alt="Top Internet Marketing blogs" width="500" height="230" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately Dollar James being only a Google page rank 2, I am not yet in the ranking. Meanwhile with a continuous work, I should be able to improve significantly my various rankings. My strategy for the moment is to focus on link building, and as you may imagine, I will definitely use these Top Internet Marketing Blogs in order to get useful information but probably also a few backlinks.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Just wanted to inform update you about how I <strong>make money online</strong>, and how much I make. So basically, I make money by writing blogs about topics I know about.  In the last two months, I safely received 2 cheques from Google. For september, I received a $213 cheque where as for october I received a $131 cheque. So which blog performed well?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The blogs that performed well were as usual &#8220;<a title="The Color Contacts Guide" href="http://thecolorcontacts.blogspot.com" target="_blank">The Color Contacts</a>&#8221; which made between $70 to $80 each month. <a title="My Color Contacts Blog" href="http://mycolorcontacts.blogspot.com" target="_blank">My color contacts</a> blog made between $15 and $25 in the month. Regarding my two eye laser blogs, Eye Laser Surgery &amp; Lasix Surgery blog, the earnings were also around $20 each. My others blogs making the remaing dollars. As you may have noticed i have removed adsense from <strong>Dollar James</strong> for the moment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have read recently my last articles, you may have noticed that I have launched several blogs in the last week in order to talk about topics I know about but also to analyse the impact of a domain name on the Google Ranking. I have therefore launched 3 blogs about handhelds pda &amp; <a title="Smartphone Nokia E71 Review" href="http://handheldspda.com/smartphone-nokia-e71" target="_blank">smartphones</a>. They are <a title="Handhelds PDA Guide" href="http://handheldspda.com" target="_blank">Handhelds PDA</a> which is hosted on DollarJames, <a title="PDA Handhelds Guide" href="http://www.pda-handhelds.com" target="_blank">PDA Handhelds</a> &amp; <a title="Handhelds Computers Guide" href="http://www.handheldscomputers.com" target="_blank">Handhelds Computers</a> which are hosted on Blogger but have their own domain name. I have also launched an extra blog on <a title="Eyes Surgery Guide" href="http://www.eyes-surgery.com" target="_blank">eye laser surgery</a> with a proper domain name in order to have a better visibility in Google and therefore to have more readers.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding this month, my earnings will be again around $130, even though I hope that with the new blogs, it will increase to around $200 considering it is christmas also! As usual I will keep you updated in the next months!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this article is to report on my Dollar James blog about my analysis on whether a <strong>domain name</strong> can influence or not your ranking in Google search engine. I am not too sure whether I will be able to conclude on something reliable or not, but I will give it a go, as I know there has been a tough debate about this domain name issue for several years. So how did all this happen? And how will I proceed?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After creating my blog <a title="Logic Instrument Crash Guide" href="http://logicinstrument.com" target="_blank">Logicinstrument.com</a>, I saw that my new blog was quickly well ranked under Google as I was already on the first page after only 3 days for the Google search &#8220;Logic Instrument&#8221;. If you search for these terms under Google.com you will see that there are over 14 million results. What is quite extraodinary is that a few days after my blog creation, my blog is already ranked in TOP 10 of Google for the term Logic Instrument. So maybe the domain name has a big impact on my ranking? Thats what I first thought when I saw this. Meanwhile after searching a bit, I found under the Google adword keyword tool that there were only about 3,000 searches per month worldwide for these terms. Therefore this probably means that in terms of <strong>SEO</strong> there is little competition. But I am unable to check this. As a consequence I decided to create several other blogs, with good domain names and which have larger seaches per month.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The blogs that I have created are: <a title="PDA Handhelds Guide" href="http://www.pda-handhelds.com" target="_blank">pda-handhelds.com</a>, <a title="Eyes Surgery Guide" href="http://www.eyes-surgery.com" target="_blank">eyes-surgery.com</a> and <a title="Handhelds Computers Guide" href="http://www.handheldscomputers.com" target="_blank">handheldscomputers.com</a> ! I chose topics that i knew well, handhelds &amp; pda and eye surgery. As you may have noticed I have two domain names with a &#8216;-&#8217; in between two words, and one without. This is basically to see if this has an impact or not on your ranking. As from what I read online, it appears that in some cases Google considers that if you have the words.com domain name (ex: <a title="Logic Instrument Crash Guide" href="http://logicinstrument.com" target="_blank">logicinstrument.com</a> or <a title="Handhelds Computers Guide" href="http://www.handheldscomputers.com" target="_blank">handheldscomputers.com</a>), they will consider it as the website where the concept or word comes from. In other words its as if you were the brand, or that you owned the word. But I cannot validate this yet. This is why I created these domaines, in order to see if the domain name had an impact on the SEO and on your <strong>Google ranking</strong>. I will keep you updated with my analysis after a few days or weeks.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Surfing on youtube, I found a pretty funny video. It is a compilation of the best bad days at the office. As you can see on it, it seems that most bad days are due to problems with computers and equipment. I must admit that sometimes a PC can drive your really nuts! With the financial crisis and che various cash issues, I guess anyone under stress and with technical equipment problems may want to do what can be seen in the video below. After seeing this video I decided to launch a new blog &#8220;<a title="Logic Instrument! The logic instruments crash guide" href="http://logicinstrument.com" target="_blank">Logic Instrument</a>&#8221; which is basically a humorous blog about equipment that crash or simply dont work. So here is the video!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">During the last few years, <strong>viral marketing</strong> has become very popular on the internet. Viral marketing can be considered as a marketing technique based on social networks that will help you to increase your brand, blog or website awareness. In some cases it can also have a more commercial side to it, in order to achieve other commercial objectives such as a product or service sale. It is very similar to word of mouth but uses various supports to enhance the spontaneous word of mouth enthusiasm. One way to do viral marketing is to use videos and put them online, on various websites such as <a title="YouTube.com" href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank">youtube</a> or <a title="DailyMotion.com" href="http://dailymotion.com" target="_blank">dailymotion</a>. Today we will be having a look at whether <strong>viral videos</strong> can be used or not in order to drive<strong> traffic</strong> to your blog or website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make a viral video, you either need a good camera and do it yourself or use a web agency. Companies mostly use web agencies where as bloggers tend to create viral videos themselves. The goal for companies is to drive traffic where as for bloggers it is mainly for fun and notoriety. But in both cases, creating viral video has a cost as it requires equipment and time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a title="Can Viral Video Clips Drive Targeted Traffic?" href="http://www.marketingexperiments.com/improving-website-conversion/viral-video-clips-targeted-traffic.html" target="_blank">Marketingexperiments.com</a> created 28 videos which were published on Youtube and Google Video in order to see the effect it had on traffic and whether this method was profitable. or not Each video  was amateurish and had a length between 15 seconds to 8 minutes and included a link to their main website. The total cost for the equipment was $9,600. The goal of their expirement was not to produce videos like an advertising agency would, but to produce more amateur videos as bloggers would do in order to analyse their viral impact on traffic. As a consequence, the videos were not promotional but more humorous oriented. They then tracked during 2 months the amount of times each video was viewed, the click-through rate and subscription rate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So what were the results? Well they were rather good, as in 2 months the 28 videos had 324,190 views. The amount of clicks to their site from these video was 4,162 which represents a 1.28% click rate! The conversion rate to newsletter subscribtion was 1.49%! What is really interesting in their analysis is that they compared this to PPC Traffic. They found out that the cost for advertising with PPC for the first two months would have been of $1,248.60 which is equal to $20.14 per subscriber where as it would have been free if published on video social media platforms such as Youtube and Google Video.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To sum up, you can clearly see that by creating a viral video you can drive traffic easily and save money compared to Video PPC. Nevertheless creating a viral video is not that easy. To help you, I recommend you to read an article on <a title="The Secret Strategies behind viral videos" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/22/the-secret-strategies-behind-many-viral-videos/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a> about <a title="The Secret Strategies behind viral videos" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/22/the-secret-strategies-behind-many-viral-videos/" target="_blank">the secret strategies behind many viral videos</a>.</p>
