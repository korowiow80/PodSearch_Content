religious texts based upon Wiccan and Pagan faiths.  The texts
contained within the books can focus on rituals, magic spells, ethics
and/or philosophies concerned with the faith.  The book of shadows is
important to practicing witch's as it is a place for them to store
their personal notes with regards to their spiritual and magical
experiences.  Many who are not practicing witch's simply use the book
of shadows as a diary.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.paganbound.com/images/articleimages/boslarge.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;font size="2" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"&gt;An example of a book of shadows&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Where did the Book of Shadows come from?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;The book of shadows was produced by Gerald Gardener who was the head of the Bricket Wood coven during the 1940's.  Originally called Ye Bok of ye art magikal, Gardener used the book to record the spell mixings which had been successful for him.  From this book, Gardener encouraged his students to copy the spells into their own books and remove any that did not work for them.  The name 'Book of Shadows' was first used by Gardener who named it after an ancient Indian manual that described how one could use their own shadow for divination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"&gt;How the Book of Shadows is used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Today the Book of Shadows is still used in the traditional sense by many practicing witchcraft who use the journal to record their own spells and experiences.  These personal notes are then often shared with others who are also practicing.  Although the journal is a personal item, there are common ways in which the contents of the book are organised so that the books are easier to reference at a later date.  The information is usually compiled in the following manner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Book title and date&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Book Blessing&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Index&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Contents&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can see that the formatting is very similar to a regular encyclopaedia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Mullen from &lt;a href="http://www.paganbound.com/bookofshadows-c-60.html"&gt;Book of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Reprint Rights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;You

      <title>How to use a Crystal Ball</title>
      <link>http://www.paganbound.com/news/how-to-use-a-crystal-ball-a-1.html</link>
      <comments>http://www.paganbound.com/news/how-to-use-a-crystal-ball-a-1-comments.html</comments>
      <description>&lt;div class="content" id="how_to_use_a_crystal_ball-content"&gt;
		
&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most important first step in using a crystal ball is to do it when you feel the mood and atmosphere is right.  If you have to force yourself into a session then the results will be adversely affected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the crystal ball in a quiet and dimly lit room.  Some people find it useful to have a candle burning although others find it a distraction, just do what you feel comfortable with.  The main thing is to make sure you use the ball in a place where you will not be disturbed as this will obviously affect the reading.  Now, it?s time to get started!  Place the crystal ball in front of you and relax.  Place your hands on the ball and think of a question you would like answered.  Visualise this subject in your mind and, when the time feels right (usually after a few minutes) remove your hands from the ball.  Now, look deeply into the crystal ball and allow your eyes to become relaxed and unfocused.  In a short time you should see a mist or smoke forming in the crystal, let this fill the ball and eventually the mist should clear to reveal images.  These images might not be what you expected to see but it is important not to discount them and carry on trying to see something that isn?t there!  Just let the images materialise and eventually they will fade away.  Don?t try to make sense of them at this stage but just try to remember what you see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the images clear you can end your scrying session. However, it is important that you don?t take you hands off the crystal ball immediately.  Before removing your hands, you should visualise the mists coming back and covering your images (even if there?s nothing there!).  This will close the scrying session properly and allow the crystal ball to return to its natural state so it is ready for the next time you wish to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now you need to try and interpret the images you have seen in relation to your question.  This is something that only you can do as the images are related to your own self.  Just follow your instincts and you?ll be on the right path.  One more final important point ? Do not let anyone else use your crystal ball.  This will affect the energy of the ball and will make it more difficult for you to use effectively in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a crystal ball takes a lot of practice in order to achieve results.  However, with time you will find that it becomes easier and that the images you see will become more vivid and easier to interpret.  However, once you have mastered the art it can be a very rewarding and enjoyable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy scrying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;Gary Mullen from &lt;a href="http://www.paganbound.com/crystalball-c-58.html"&gt;Crystal Ball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;font style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Reprint Rights&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;You
