<p>Ready for an unprecedented ‘inside look’ into how<br />
professional traders find successful trades and<br />
how they manage risk?</p>
<p>Better yet, to get &#8216;live&#8217; actionable trading ideas?</p>
<p>The Live Trading Labs will give you the luxury of watching<br />
expert options traders as they identify the most profitable<br />
trades that the market has to offer, and then TRADE THEM.</p>
<p>Live in front of your eyes&#8230;</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s clear to me that this is one of Options<br />
University&#8217;s<br />
best services yet!</p>
<p>To learn more about it&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to invite you to attend one of TWO preview<br />
webinars to be held on Tuesday, February 16 at 12 Noon EST and<br />
9:00 pm EST.</p>
<p>On these webinars, Options University will give you a &#8220;pull<br />
back the curtain&#8221; preview of the Live Trading Labs, and<br />
show you what they are all about. (and how you can make money)</p>
<p>Plus&#8230;</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find out how you can score yourself $794 in primo<br />
options education if you decide to join the Live Trading<br />
Labs.</p>
<p>But I think you&#8217;ll truly be bowled over by what will be<br />
revealed on these webinars.</p>
<p>So, without further delay&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the web page to get more information, and to<br />
register<br />
for one of these complimentary webinars:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Live-Trading">http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Live-Trading</a></p>
<p>Please clear your calendar next Tuesday for one of these<br />
webinars if you can, because&#8230;</p>
<p>This one could cause your <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a> portfolio to<br />
catapult to the next level!</p>
<p>P.S. Don&#8217;t put this off.</p>
<p>Options University&#8217;s Live Trading Labs service is unique<br />
in the world of trading education.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of any other product or service that gives<br />
you this much &#8216;hands-on&#8217; experience, with<br />
professional traders guiding you every step of the way to successful<br />
options trading.</p>
<p>At least attend one of the two webinars next Tuesday, and<br />
make up your mind whether or not this service is for you.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options trading</a> involve a learning curve, so if a trader tries to invest his money into options without understanding the <a title="fundamentals of options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/options-trading-basics/fundamentals-of-options-trading/">fundamentals of options trading</a> then he might need to face the consequences of heavy losses. Therefore it’s advisable to learn the basics first before getting involved in trading. Below are some important Options Trading Tips to consider before you think of jumping onto the roller coaster ride called options.</p>
<p><strong>Common Mistake:</strong> One of the most common mistake that beginners make is the fact that if they believe that the market is bearish and is going to fall they may choose to sell call options, where as they can buy put options instead. Put options are opposite of Call options, in call option if a trader gets a right to buy the underlying asset then in put option a trader gets a right to sell the underlying asset.</p>
<p><strong>Hedging:</strong> Traders can use options to hedge the risks their portfolio might have. For example: if a trader has a bullish portfolio but he is worried that if the markets move downward he might be losing money, in that case he can hedge his downward risk by purchasing put options. On the contrary if a trader has a bearish portfolio and he is worried about the market moving upwards then he can hedge his risk by purchasing call options.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy: </strong>If profit is what trader is looking at out of his options trading then he may consider some of the popular options trading strategies like Straddle and Option Spreads. If these strategies are employed correctly then trades can have a limited amount of losses but at the same time amount of profits can be unlimited.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage: </strong>With option one needs to invest not more than 10% of the money required for investing in same quantity of underlying asset. So by investing in options a trader can manage the same quantity of asset and can leverage upon the unused money.</p>
<p><strong>Options Paper Trading: </strong>If you are a beginner or you believe you have a money making strategy, in any case it’s better to test your instincts before you choose to invest your own money into options trading. With options paper trading or online simulations a trader can test his strategy without investing his/her own money.</p>
<p>These were some of the Options Trading Tips that can guide you before you start investing in options or while you are trading in options.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before a trader tries to design any strategy for trading options, it’s very essential for him/her to understand the fundamentals or basics of <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a>. In this article we will try to learn the options trading basics by looking at some of the frequently asked questions. Below are some of the FAQ’s on Options Trading Basics:</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between Stocks and Stock Options?</strong><br />
Usually traders would have traded stocks before so the first question that arises in their mind is to find the difference between the stocks and stock options. Options are derivatives or extensions of stocks, commodities, currencies or index. Derivatives instruments are valued based on the performance of the underlying asset. With stock options traders are not actually buying the stocks but they are buying a right to either buy or sell a particular quantity of stocks at a certain price before the expiration date. Whereas buying or selling stock means buying and selling the ownership of a security. Amount of investments required with options is not more than 10% of the investments required with stocks, so traders can leverage upon the investments that are not being utilized.</p>
<p><strong>What are the types of option?</strong><br />
There are two types of options:<br />
Call option – Owner of Call option gets a right to buy an underlying asset at a pre defined price before the contract end date.<br />
Put option – Owner of Put option gets a right to sell an underlying asset at a predefined price before the contract end date.</p>
<p><strong>What are the risks of options trading?<br />
</strong>One of the most risky aspects of <a title="option trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">option trading</a> is the fact that the option contract may expire worthless and the buyer of contract may end up losing his premium money if his/her judgment on the price of underlying asset goes wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Why options are being used?<br />
</strong>Options have a potential with the help of which a trader can make a fortune if he/she employs correct strategy, so options are being used to gain profits.  However, options are also being used by hedge fund managers, institutional investors or individual investors to hedge against the risk their portfolio might have.</p>
<p><strong>What are the requirements for trading options?</strong><br />
A trader may need brokerage account, trading account and enough money in his/her trading account for him/her to be able to trade options. Trader can trade online using software, through a website or by calling his brokerage firm and placing a trade.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are several online and in class <a title="Options Trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options Trading</a> Course available today to take advantage of. As talked in earlier blogs it’s better to know the <a title="fundamentals of options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/options-trading-basics/fundamentals-of-options-trading/">fundamentals of options trading</a> before you actually start investing your own money into it. Ignorance is not bliss for options, and if it has a potential to give handsome returns then it also has power to drag the trader into heavy losses if he doesn’t have enough knowledge. For example: Options are quite different from stocks, so if a trader doesn’t have options trading knowledge and if he is bearish about the market then he might choose to sell call options when put options can be bought instead.</p>
<p>Different courses have different emphasis on the range of options topic:</p>
<p>1.)    <strong>Basics or Options Trading Fundamentals</strong> – There are more courses available that are based on Basics or fundamentals of options trading in comparison to any other subjects. This is because of the reason that many traders only believe in gaining the basic knowledge of options trading that would make them ready for trade, and other trading subjects can be learned by practice.</p>
<p>2.)    <strong>Learning options trading strategies</strong> – This is also an interesting subject to gain knowledge upon. If options trading strategies are perfectly designed and employed then the options have power to offer unlimited returns with limited amounts of risks. This course teaches the different strategies that hedge funds and institutional investors use to hedge their risks as well as to take advantage of market opportunities.</p>
<p>3.)    <strong>Designing options trading strategies </strong>– No two traders have same type of beliefs or same appetite to take risks. So there are several courses available where apart from teaching the class what type of trading strategies traders use today they are also being helped in devising an options trading strategy which best suits their beliefs, risk appetite and current portfolio position.</p>
<p>4.)    <strong>Stock <a title="option trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">option trading</a></strong> – Options trading becomes more interesting if a trader also own the underlying asset so in this course the class is taught the different possibilities if one wishes to trade in a particular stock as well as its derivatives (options).</p>
<p>With the popularity of internet most of these courses are also offered online where class can learn options trading at their own comfort. Therefore considering one’s current understanding about options and considering their zeal to learn a particular subject they can choose the Options Trading Course that best suits.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Options have a potential to drag the trader into losses if the trade is being carried out without any knowledge. Where as if one knows how to trade options then they can make use of several strategies which can help them minimize the amount of risks and at the same time it increases the chances to earn profit. If an effort is made to learn <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a> then one can find out how flexible and powerful options are and how one can take advantage of this trading instrument.</p>
<p>Option Spread Trading is one of the best strategies to capitalize upon among all the available strategies. Clubbing two separate option trades with different strike price and different expiry can be termed as option spreads. Also within this strategy there are different ways how one can trade:</p>
<p>1.)    <strong>Vertical spreads: </strong>Includes the option trades which belong to the same underlying security, similar expiration month but are being traded at distinct strike price.</p>
<p>2.)    <strong>Horizontal or calendar spreads:</strong> Includes the option trades which belong to the same underlying security and similar strike prices but with distinct expiration dates.</p>
<p>3.)    <strong>Diagonal spreads: </strong>These spreads are called diagonal because they are a combination of Vertical and Horizontal spreads. In Diagonal spreads same underlying securities are being traded but with distinct strike prices and expiration dates. <strong></strong></p>
<p>4.)    <strong>Bull and Bear spreads: </strong>If a spread is being created where in the trades would be in profit if the price of underlying security rises then it is a bull spread. Where as if a spread is being created where in the trades would be in profit if the price of underlying security is going down then it is bear spreads.<strong></strong></p>
<p>5.)    <strong>Ratio spreads and backspreads: </strong>Spreads are also being designed where unequal quantity of options are being purchased and sold at the same time. So if more options are being sold than are bought then the trade is being termed as ratio spread. On the contrary if more options are purchased than sold then the trade is being termed as backspread.</p>
<p>Above were some of the ways how a trader can design spread position with options. A trader can choose the option spread trading strategy that best suits the current market situations and his/her current portfolio.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Good knowledge is the key for trading options with handsome returns and hence option is not an instrument for ignorant investors. There are several ways how you can trade in options; it can be by calling a brokerage firm, by using a web based trading platform or by <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a> software. One of the most striking disadvantages of options trading by calling a brokerage firm is the time it takes. At times a trader may need to wait in the queue for his turn and during this time he might lose a trading opportunity especially if he is trading with thin margins.</p>
<p>In this article we will see Options Trading Software in detail. To take advantage of this Software based trading system there are couple of things that are most important for a trader that is a computer and an internet connection. If a trader has a computer and an internet connection then he can install the software and start trading from any part of the world. By trading through software, trader can see real-time changes and if he finds an opportunity in front of him he can take quick decision make a buy or sell trade and make profits out of it. This type of pace is not possible with a trader calling the brokerage firm waiting for his turn, asking the current price and then making a trade.</p>
<p>There is quite a good number of software available today in the market. Below are some of the key features of available software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Other than regular buying and selling functions these software’s also lets you put a trigger so even if you are not tracking the price of an option still the trade can be executed if it reaches a certain point.</li>
<li>One can also see different types of useful data such as today’s open price, yesterday’s close price, today’s high and low, volume of a particular instrument being traded and open interest.</li>
<li>At times this software also provides tips of current buying or selling opportunities.</li>
<li>Brokerage is being charged depending on the facilities that the trading software provides. So if it’s high-end software with lot of features and also provides tips then it will have high brokerage, where as if it’s trading software with simple buying and selling features it will naturally have less brokerage.</li>
</ul>
<p>A trader should choose the Options Trading Software that best suits his/her requirements, considering his options trading knowledge and brokerage expense.</p>

<p>Option is basically a contract between a buyer and a seller where buyer of the contract has a right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predefined strike price before the contract end date. Buyer of the contract has a right but he/she is not obligated to exercise their rights. There are two types of options, Call and Put. Call option gives the buyer of the contract a right to buy an underlying asset, while Put option gives buyer of the contract a right to sell an underlying asset. If a trader is bullish about the market he can choose to buy Call options and if a trader is bearish about the market he can choose to buy Put options.</p>
<p>If options have great profit potential then it also have a power to drag a trader into heavy losses if he/she doesn’t know basics of <a title="Options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options trading</a>. So it’s important to get familiar with <a title="fundamentals of options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/options-trading-basics/fundamentals-of-options-trading/">fundamentals of options trading</a> and then start investing your own money. Once you are fundamentally clear about options trading next step is to make strategies. There are several strategies like Straddle and Option spread where a trader buys and sells option where he/she can earn profits depending upon how far the market price goes from the strike price immaterial of the direction. So with these strategies in place may the market be bull or bear it works in favor of the trader.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind trader should learn the fundamentals and create a spread strategy which gives unlimited profits with limited risk out of Option Trading System.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a learning curve involved before a trader starts trading options. To avoid the risk of losing huge amount of money one should try and learn the fundamentals and then trade options. Below is some of the important information for <a title="Option Trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Option Trading</a> beginners:</p>
<p><strong>What are Options?</strong></p>
<p>Option is a contract between a buyer and a seller which gives the buyer of the contract a right to either buy or sell the underlying asset at a particular price before the contract end date. However, in case of options, buyer does not have an obligation to exercise his/her rights.</p>
<p><strong>Types of Options</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of Options Contract which are as mentioned below.</p>
<p><strong>a.) Call Option:</strong> Call Option is a contract where buyer of the contract is bullish about the price of underlying asset and has a right to buy underlying asset at predefined strike price. If the current market price of the underlying asset is above the strike price it’s in trader’s interest to exercise his right and buy the lot of underlying asset. And if the current market price of the asset is below the strike price he/she can forget about the premium paid for the contract and buy the underlying asset from the open market.</p>
<p><strong>b.) Put Option:</strong> Put Option is a contract where buyer of the contract is bearish about the price of underlying asset and has a right to sell the underlying asset at a predefined strike price. If the current market price of the underlying asset is below the strike price trader can exercise his right and sell the lot of underlying asset. And if the current market price of the asset is above strike price he/she can forget about the premium paid for the contract and sell the underlying asset in open market.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of <a title="Options Trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options Trading</a></strong></p>
<p>One of the most important advantage of using Options as a financial instrument is the leverage it has to offer. If you want to buy options contract you need to shed out 10% of investment then the investment required for the same number of underlying asset from the market. By paying 10% of total investment as premium one can manage the whole lot of underlying asset with options contract.</p>
<p>A trader should learn the basics with the help of Options Trading Tutorial before he/she starts investing actual money into the market.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trading in Options without understanding the fundamentals can be dangerous for your investment portfolio. At times there are situations where traders buy call options and to square off their positions instead of selling call options they buy put options which can bring in losses for them. To avoid this kind of situations paper trading becomes a great learning tool for the starters.  Paper trading is a process where a trader can employ his/her real time trade beliefs without investing actual money. The activity of Options paper trading feels the same as you are investing in the real market. A trader can analyze the market, evaluate the technical charts or use his/her gut or belief and trade in options accordingly without any risk of losing huge money.</p>
<p><strong>Why Options Paper Trading is a Great Learning Tool</strong></p>
<p>Paper trading offers the benefit of performing a trade which is similar to how one trades real time. So if a trader is buying or selling an option it will be traded at the current market price, market fluctuations are being displayed in real time, current positions can be squared off and one can see if the portfolio is in profit or loss with paper trading. All this can be carried out without the risk of losing your own money. Additionally, since your actual money is not at stake you can follow your trading system or trading beliefs without any reactions of greed and fear. At times market fluctuations are such that greed and fear acts against your trading rules or beliefs, and in turn stops you from earning profits that your strategy deserves. And once you have tested your decisions and know the fundamentals and market movements of options you can start investing in the real market.</p>
<p><a title="Options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options trading</a> have a potential where one can make a fortune; so if the option spread positions are taken correctly then there remains a limited risk and it offers unlimited returns on your investments. There are several free online simulations available where you can test your strategies before applying them to your actual investments.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Any trader would firstly need to look at all the available financial instruments before deciding the one which best suits his/her current portfolio. He/she can look at the advantages, disadvantages, risks, revenue and expenses of all the instruments. If a trader has decided to trade in options, then he/she needs to decide the medium of trading that is offline <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a> (through  the phone) or online options trading(over the internet). Some of the conventional traders go with offline trading where they have the investment money sitting into their trading account; so whenever they wish to trade they can pick up a phone and call the brokerage firm who manages their brokerage account.</p>
<p>Some of the non conventional and new generation of traders find the option of online trading much more appealing considering the advantages it has to offer. For online trading one needs to know basics of computers and internet. Online trading may follow any of the two formats mentioned below:</p>
<p>1.)    Web based format: In the web based format you only need to have internet access and a web browser loaded on your computer which is pretty common these days, so as long as you have this available you can start trading from any part of the world. One can manage online options trading in the same way they log in and manage their bank account.</p>
<p>2.)    Software based format: In the software based format one needs to install software on the computer, so they can do trading only on that computer or any other computer which has the required software.</p>
<p>Developers of these formats take utmost care that the trading is as simple as possible for the traders which eliminate the time required to learn web based or software based trading formats. Apart from providing a trading platform these applications also provide excellent management tools which make the expense and revenue tracking of the portfolio pretty smooth for the traders. These online applications also send real time trading tips to the traders to take advantage of changing market movements.</p>
<p>One of the best advantages of online trading is: if there is a market opportunity then the trader can make a decision and do real time trading, where as if a trader is trading offline he may need to wait on the phone for his/her turn and by the time the price he is looking for might have changed.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Option is a contract which gives right and not an obligation to either buy or sell a particular underlying asset at a particular price before the contract end date. Since it’s just a contract to buy asset at a future date there is a premium associated with it and not the actual value of the asset. Usually the value of the contract is not more than 10% of the total value of the assets represented by the options contract. By trading in options one is managing a large amount of assets by paying relatively low options prices.</p>
<p>As the options contract represents the underlying asset the premium to be paid for the same is also based upon the fluctuations in the value of underlying asset. Below are some of the pricing related questions that may rise in the mind of traders:</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between in-the-money and out-of-the-money?</strong><br />
In-the-money trade is the one which has an intrinsic value associated with it. So if the underlying assets current market price is way above the strike price in case of call option and if the current market price is way below the strike price in case of put option then the trade is in-the-money.<br />
Out-of-the-money is the opposite of in-the-money. So if the underlying asset’s market price is below the strike price in case of call options and if the market price is above the strike price in case of put options then the trade is out-of-the-money.</p>
<p><strong>However at times traders do ask what is the reason for options not moving as much as the underlying asset? </strong><br />
The answer is options would not move in the same pace as the underlying assets value unless they are in the money or unless they are very close to the expiration.</p>
<p><strong> Some traders may also ask that even if the stock value increases by 2% even then what is the reason for the downward trend in the value of call option?</strong><br />
The answer is there are several different factors that make the value of an option rise or fall, namely, contract end date, strike price, interest rate, stock price, and volatility. Usually, if the price of underlying asset goes up and all other factors remain constant then the value of call option would also rise. However if the value of call option is falling then there may be some other factors that are not performing in favor of the trade.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trading options has many benefits when compared to other investment vehicles. Option gives a trader liberty to invest in favor of a specific direction in which market will move. For example a trader can forecast that a financial security will be trading above or below a particular price 5 months from now and invest in options accordingly. In United States an option contract includes 100 underlying asset’s units, so with very little amount of investments a trader can control good number of underlying asset position. Because of this reason trader loves the leverage that options provide and that remains to be one of the top reasons why traders would choose to invest in options over any other type of investments.</p>
<p>There is a learning curve involved and because of this reason a trader requires to be careful before investing in options. So by investing in options if one can make a fortune then there is also a possibility that one can lose huge amounts of money by investing in options. Therefore ignorance is not bliss in case you are considering investing in options.</p>
<p><strong>Option Strategies</strong></p>
<p>If you are aware about the fundamentals of options you can begin learning some strategies that can be employed while trading options. Firstly, there are call options for the traders who are bullish about overall market or a particular asset; on the contrary, if a trader is bearish about the markets or a particular asset he/she can invest in put option. Straddle and Option Spread are the two strategies if used correctly can help the trader to put a limit on the losses that he/she can make and at the same time trade can give unlimited returns.</p>
<p><strong>Option Pricing</strong></p>
<p>Option pricing is based on the performance of the underlying asset it is representing. Usually the price or premium to be paid for an option contract is not more than 10% of the investment of the actual asset price. So even if a trader wants to invest in a particular stock he can select a strike price and can invest in options which would be 10% of the total investments and he can use the remaining money to invest in something else until the contract end date.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While choosing a Financial Instrument one needs to take utmost care about all the upside and downside of that instrument. There are several financial instruments available in the market today, a trader can consider investing in stocks, commodity, currency, mutual funds, exchange traded funds, futures or options. In this article we will try and draw your attention towards Options as an investment type.</p>
<p>Option is a contract between the buyer and seller, which gives an owner of the contract a right, but no obligation, to either buy or sell an underlying asset at a predefined price before the contract end date. Below are some of the advantage and disadvantages of Options Investing.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leverage is one of the top advantages of investing in options. While investing in options a trader is just investing in the premium which is usually not more than 10% of the value of the asset.</li>
<li>Option gives a right and there is no obligation to buy or sell the asset at a future date, therefore if a trader finds the current market price not in favor of his options position then he/she can forget about the premium amount paid and choose not to exercise their rights.</li>
<li>There are two types of options Calls and Puts to take advantage of bullish and bearish market trends respectively.</li>
<li>A trader can use options to hedge their portfolio’s upside as well as downside risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a learning curve involved for trading options, so if one follows their own beliefs and blindly invest in options then he/she should be ready to face the consequences of heavy losses. Hence it’s better to know the fundamentals before jumping in to options investing.</li>
<li>If you are a trader who is actually interested in the underlying asset and you belong to the seller’s side of call or put option then there is a chance that the buyer of an option may choose not to exercise his/her right and you end up not getting the underlying asset and just the premium.</li>
</ul>
<p>So trader should keep these aspects of option in mind before choosing a right instrument for their portfolio.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options trading</a> have opened up a new horizon for the traders, which not only helps them in earning good profits out of it but also for protecting their current investments.

<p>Option is a contract between the buyer and the seller that basically gives the owner right to either buy or sell the underlying asset at a predefined price before the contract end date. But there is no obligation for the owner to exercise his rights. There could be different portfolio strategies considering which a trader would invest in options:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a trader wants to buy his stocks or asset at a future date or he wants to sell his stocks or asset at a future date, he can purchase call or put options.</li>
<li>Trader can buy or sell the contract for profit and not for exercising the rights associated with the contract.</li>
<li>One can also use options for hedging their portfolio. So for example: for any trader if there is a downside risk he can use put options and if he is bearish investor and thinks there is a upward risk he can use call options and protect his portfolio from market movements.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best things about futures and options is the leverage, which means one does not need to invest the whole amount of the derivatives contract. Different derivatives contract would have different margin requirements, based on that one needs to make necessary arrangements before they can trade options.</p>
<p>What would traders need to have before they can start trading options?</p>
<ol>
<li>One would need to have a trading account</li>
<li>Brokerage account</li>
<li>Required Margin money in the account</li>
<li>Online traders would require (I.) Online trading account and a (II.) Trading software</li>
<li>Conventional traders who trade through phone will need to have number of his broker handy so that he/she can take advantage of changing market conditions.</li>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Futures and <a title="Options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options trading</a> goes hand in hand so if we are discussing about options there bound to be a discussion on futures. Although they both are similar from some dimensions still they do have some very striking differences that a trader should consider before he/she starts trading in them. Futures and Options are broadly known as derivatives and this is because they are extensions of the underlying asset and not an asset by themselves. Their value is derived from the market movements in the value of the underlying asset.</p>
<p>In the previous blogs we have seen that Options contract gives the owner a right to either buy (for call option) or sell (for put option) the underlying asset at a predefined price before the contract end date, however owner of the contract is not obligated to exercise his/her rights. On the contrary, in a futures contract buyer is obligated to purchase the asset at a predefined price at the contract end date, in the same manner seller is obligated to sell the asset at a predefined price at the contract end date.</p>
<p>In the futures contract traders are actually investing in the whole value of an asset at a future date where as in case of options contract it has an expense associated with it which is called ‘premium’. So if a trader wants to buy an asset then he can purchase a futures contract where he is investing in actual value of asset with no other cost, while in case of options if a trader exercises his/her rights then they are supposed to pay value of the asset plus the premium (cost). In case of futures, if the current market value is not in favor of current position even then a trader would be obligated to buy or sell the underlying asset, where as with options a trader can forget about the premium paid and not exercise his right to either buy or sell.</p>
<p>One important difference between futures and options is also in the way one can make profit. In case of call option if a trader can see a price difference between the current market price and option premium plus the strike price then they can take advantage of the situation and make money immediately. Whereas returns out of futures are ‘marked to market’ every day which means changes in the value of investment will be accounted to parties in contract at the end of the trading session.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trading options has brought a completely new and different dimension for traders which not only help them to hedge their portfolio risk but also to earn good return on investments. Previously we have discussed about many different types of <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a> strategies however in this blog we will be looking in detail at two of the most profit making strategies:</p>
<p><strong>1.) </strong> <strong>Straddle:</strong> It is a strategy where a particular option is purchased or sold and that allows a trader to earn profits depending upon how far the market price goes from the strike price immaterial of the direction. If one is buying option derivatives it is called long straddle and if one is selling option derivatives it is called short straddle.</p>
<ol>
<li>Long straddle is when a trader purchases both a call and a put option, both the call and put options are bought at the same strike price. Trader would earn handsome returns if the price of the stock moves far away from the strike price, may it be upwards or downwards. If you look at the payoff diagram of long straddle it is a V shaped diagram.</li>
<li>Short straddle is when a trader sells both a call and a put option of same underlying asset at a similar strike price and contract end date. In this case the profit is limited to call and put options premium, trader would lose money if the price of the stock moves up and down a lot. This is a risky strategy and the payoff diagram is inverted V shaped.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>2.) Option spreads:</strong> In this strategy spread position can be employed by purchasing and selling same number of options with similar underlying asset but with different strike price and different contract end dates. Option spreads are divided into three broad categories namely vertical spreads, horizontal spreads and diagonal spread. Vertical spreads includes options of similar underlying asset with similar contract end dates but different strike prices. Horizontal spreads would have similar strike price but different contract end dates for the same underlying asset. Whereas diagonal spreads would have same underlying asset but contracts with different strike prices and contract end dates. Within these options spreads there are different verities like Call and put spreads, Bull and bear spreads, Credit and debit spreads, Ratio spreads and backspreads, Spread combinations and Box spreads.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stock <a title="Option trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Option trading</a> is not for novice, however if you have worked hard enough to understand the fundamentals of stock options it can be a great money making and hedging instrument for your portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>So what is the difference between Stocks trading and Stock Option trading?</strong></p>
<p>One of the core differences is stocks offer a stake in the company or a small part of ownership of the company, where as stock option just provides a right to buy or sell stock of a company at a predefined price and within a certain time frame. Any trade can be carried out only if there is a buyer and a seller for a particular instrument; so as there are buyers for call and put options likewise there are also sellers for call and put options.</p>
<p><strong>Now you might be thinking how can a trader use Stock Option?</strong></p>
<p>A trader can use stock option in following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A trader can actually buy and sell the underlying asset      (stock) through buying and selling of call and put stock option.</li>
<li>Trader can buy and sell the contract for profit, and      not for exercising any rights associated with the contract.</li>
<li>One can also use options for hedging their current      portfolio against possible losses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if a trader is holding the underlying stock then he/she can apply some very interesting and money making strategies if they add stock options to their portfolio.</p>
<p>For example: If you already own stocks of a particular company and you wish to book your profits then you can buy a put option at a strike price which is above the current market price but at a price which gives you better returns then prevailing market price. So if the market price falls then you can exercise your right and sell your stocks as per the contract and if the market price move upward you can forget about the premium paid for the contract and sell your stocks in the spot market.</p>
<p>Likewise some traders are only looking for a profit from the market fluctuations so they simply buy an option contract with no intention of exercising their rights and sell the contract for profit. These types of traders are also known as “speculators”.</p>
<p>The above information shows how important stock <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a> can be for the traders for making their portfolio more profitable and less risk averse.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Usually, taking single or concurrent positions either long or short of different contracts at different strike price and with different expiration can be termed as option strategies. Value of calls increases when the value of underlying asset increases and the value of put increases when the value of underlying asset decreases. So if talking about a particular asset if the market value of this asset increases then it will cause the price of calls to increase and if the market value of asset decreases then it will cause the price of puts to increase. .Broadly speaking there are two option strategies namely “Bullish strategies” and “Bearish strategies”, let’s look at them one by one:</p>
<p>1.)    Bullish strategies: These types of strategies are applied when a trader believes that the underlying asset’s value is going to fly. The simplest strategy which any novice can apply is buying call option if he/she thinks that market is going to move upwards. Then there are set of traders who believes in little higher risk and are bullish can set a target price for an asset and accordingly create a bull spread which turns out to be quite low in investment. For set of traders who has lower risk appetite may choose to go for option strategies which would be profitable until the time the price of underlying asset do not go below the strike price within the contract period. Up to some extent this strategy would also have downside protection. An example of this strategy is writing “out of the money” covered calls.</p>
<p>2.)    Bearish strategies: These strategies are complete opposite of bullish strategies. Bearish strategies are applied when the trader is of the belief that market or the value of underlying asset is going to fall. The most important aspect to consider in this case is to predict how low the value stock can go and the time horizon so that best rewards can be extracted out of the trade. Buying put option is the simplest of all bearish strategies that any novice trader can apply. Risk takers would try to predict a target price for the stock and accordingly buy the spread which would be a low cost investment as well as it would make money if the market falls.</p>
<p>So traders can keep these strategies in mind and accordingly take positions which can fetches them best returns.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While learning more and more about <a title="option trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">option trading</a> one can find out how beneficial they are for the traders. Of course this statement also proves the phrase right that more the knowledge one has about a particular trade more are the chances of making profits from it. Following are some of the important aspects of option trading that one should remember:</p>
<p><strong>Option Trading:</strong></p>
<p>Like equity, mutual funds, commodity and currency, Option is also a trading instrument. Option is basically a contract which gives the buyer a right to either buy or sell the underlying asset at a certain price within a particular time period. However, with this contract buyer does have a right to buy or sell but he/she is not obligated to exercise this right. This feature makes buying a stock much different from buying an option.</p>
<p><strong>Two Types of Options:</strong></p>
<p>A trader can either trade in Call option or Put option. Both of these options are contradictory to each other.</p>
<p>In Call option a trader gets a right to buy the underlying asset at a particular price within a particular time frame. Calls are also known as long positions, and a trader would be in profits only when the price of the underlying asset stays above the strike price.</p>
<p>In Put option a trader gets a right to sell the underlying asset at a particular price within a particular time frame. Puts are also known as short positions, and a trader would be in profits only when the price of the underlying asset stays below the strike price.</p>
<p><strong>Ways to trade option:</strong></p>
<p>There are two basic ways of trading option American and European, difference between the two falls at the date when these options can be exercised. As per the American way, a trader can exercise his buying or selling rights anytime between purchase date and the expiry date. While as per the European way, a trader can exercise his buying or selling rights only when the contract expires.</p>
<p><strong>Parties involved in option trading:</strong></p>
<p>In option trading there could be four different parties involved for the two different types of options. They are buyers and sellers of Calls and Puts respectively.</p>
<p>Options are speculative instruments that best works for the traders who like to take risks.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="Option trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Option trading</a> is a contract as part of which buyer of the contract gets a right to either buy or sell the underlying asset at the agreed upon strike price and within a predefined timeframe. The very name of this type of trade “option” denotes that the trader has an option but is not obligated to exercise his/her right if the trade is not in their favor.</p>
<p>Below is a detailed explanation of call and put options:</p>
<p>1.)    <strong>Call Option:</strong> In this type of option trading, buyer of the call option has a right to buy the underlying asset but there is no obligation to exercise this right. So if the value of underlying security is not performing in their favor, then they can choose to let go off of their investments.</p>
<p>For example: A trader buys Call option contract of a stock at $35 strike price and for 2 months and the current market price of the security is also $35.</p>
<p>There could be two possibilities, one is at maturity of the contract if current market price of the stock is $42 then the buyer of the contract can exercise his right and buy the stock for $35 and earn $7 of profit. May your investments be at any of the strike price, but a market price higher than the strike price will always help you gain profits. On the other side, if current price of that stock goes to $30 then the buyer is losing $5 and he/she can choose not to exercise his rights since they can buy the same stock from the market for less.</p>
<p>2.)    <strong>Put Option: </strong>In this case buyer of this type of option contract has a right to sell the underlying security. Further, like any other option contract if the market forces are not working in favor of the contract buyer then he/she can choose not to exercise their rights.</p>
<p>For example: If a trader has taken a put option position at $35 strike price. He would want the price to fall or stay below $35 so that he can stay in profits. On the other side if the market price of underlying stock goes above $35 he would rather sell his holdings in the spot market and forget about his investments and selling rights with put option.</p>
<p>If the market trends are predicted correctly and likewise the strike price is chosen then there are excellent possibilities to earn profits.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no trading venture where there would be no risks involved. The degree of risks may be different from trade to trade, and if there is more risks involved there are more chances of a trader getting excellent returns. Like any other trade <a title="Options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options trading</a> also has a matter of risk in it.</p>
<p>First of all if someone asks what is the prime feature that makes <a title="option trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">option trading</a> risky? Then most option traders would agree with “Leverage” as the prime feature. Leverage does offer you advantage however it also has a power to snatch away your prospective gains if one fails to choose a right option at a right time. Leverage looks so lucrative which make people trade option but it is also damaging if not played in a right manner.</p>
<p>As per a finance professor’s wisdom, leverage means investing relatively less amount of money but still getting equal profits as if you have invested in full amount of the asset. This definitely sounds good but the problem is high leverage brings along a matter of higher risk.</p>
<p>Also there are different types of risks namely buyer’s risk and seller’s risk. Let’s look at what do they exactly mean one by one.</p>
<p><strong>1.) </strong><strong>Buyer’s Risk: </strong>In this type of trade there is a risk of losing your whole investment in a very short time horizon. Of course it sounds pretty interesting that one can as good as manage an asset for a time period with a fraction of its original investments by trading in option. However, if you have invested in an option contract which ends two months from now and if the value of stock stays below the strike price then the call option trader may have a chance of losing money. Additionally, the more near you are to the end of the contract and the price of the stock not in your favor, you tend to lose more and more money.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>2.) </strong><strong>Seller’s Risk:</strong> As buyer of the option contract has risk same is the case with the sellers of the option contract. So if trades are not made correctly or if the market mechanisms work against your trade then there is a possibility that seller will lose money.<strong></strong></p>
<p>Whatever may be the case, one should not only look at the risks involved but they should also consider the profit potential that option trading has.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Probably <a title="option trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">option trading</a> is the most complex and riskiest type of investment instrument of all. Most of the traders out there who have been trading in options would agree that “option trading does not entertain all the traders, only some traders can adjust to the complexities and take a decision which would work in favor of their portfolio. Apart from understanding it thoroughly one needs to have good appetite for risk for trading option.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, option trading is speculative instrument. Therefore if speculation falls out of your usual trading style then probably options are not made for you. Removing options from your trading list just because you think they are risky does as good as knowing nothing about it, because apart from being a risky investment options are highly profitable. If you have an investment portfolio and are not trading option right now then you should learn more about the technicalities and at least try your luck with options.</p>
<p>Option trading also has to offer lots of benefits which are missing in other types of investments. Trader has a great amount of flexibility with options, since within the period of option contract they may or may not exercise their right to either buy or sell the underlying asset. Further, trader has a leverage of investing only a premium (which is usually less than 10% of total amount of stocks) and still has a right on the total amount of stocks for a particular time period. Some of the options available in United States represent 100 underlying assets under them, so if a trader is investing in these options they can leverage upon the profits made by all the 100 assets.</p>
<p>But you might be thinking that what exactly option is?</p>
<p>Option is a contract that closely follows the performance of the underlying asset. In a crisp form you may not have money to invest in a property today but you are ready to pay extra $7500 to book a deal of this property at a particular price for a predefined time period. So being part of the contract you can choose to buy this property for a particular price within the predefined period or you may choose to let it go and forget about $7500 you have paid before.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though there are lots of Financial Terms in general that one might not be aware about, but for beginners following are some of the most used terms:</p>
<p><em>Option</em> – is a contract which gives the buyer a right to either buy or sell the underlying asset at a predefined strike price before the expiration of the contract. Further, buyer of the contract has a right and not an obligation to buy or sell the underlying asset.</p>
<p><em>Call Option</em> – Buyer of the Call option has a right to buy the underlying asset.</p>

If the buyer of the contract decides to exercise his rights he needs to intimate the seller regarding the same.</p>
<p><em>Expiration</em> – is the date when the contract is terminated. So if buyer of the contract wants to exercise his rights he needs to act upon the same before the end date of the contract.</p>
<p><em>In the money</em> – is when the underlying asset’s value is more than the strike price of call option. In case of Put option In the money is when the underlying assets value is less than the strike price.</p>
<p><em>Out of the money</em> – is when the underlying asset’s value is less than the strike price of call option. In case of Put option Out of the money is when the underlying assets value is more than the strike price.</p>
<p><em>Offsetting</em> – is when buyer of the contract exercises his rights, that is either buying or selling the stock during the contract period when he/she thinks that here is when he will get maximum benefits out of the trade.</p>
<p><em>Strike Price</em> – is the value at with the stock will be either bought or sold when the trader decides to offset his position. There are different Strike Prices available for the traders to trade in, ranging from Strike Price higher or lower than the stock’s current market value.</p>
<p><em>Option Premium</em> – Price paid for buying call or put option contract is called premium. Premium paid on the option are usually not more than 10% of the market value of the underlying stock.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If advantages of any businesses or trading venture are being discarded they are mostly due to the risks involved. But with <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a> there are lots of opportunities to capitalize upon which people might overlook if they only think about the risks. Further, in any type of trade there is a feature of risk involved but what one should look at is how much profit one can gain out of the trade.</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p>
<p>Even though no one can deny that options trading might not work for all, still the traders who have traded options before will agree to the fact about the flexibility it offers to the buyers as well as to the sellers.</p>
<p><strong>Safety</strong></p>
<p>When options are being compared to other types of trading instruments, risks involved with options trading are minimal. Huge losses can be avoided with options since the trader pays only the premium to buy a right and not buying the actual underlying asset. Usually value of the options hovers around 10% of the value of the asset or even lower.</p>
<p>There is a call option which works perfectly for the bulls and put option which works perfectly for the bears and eventually traders who better understands the options mechanism may take both call and put positions through which they can put a limit on the risks involved.</p>
<p><strong>Leverage</strong></p>
<p>Since the value of options is based upon how the underlying assets perform, traders can get fantastic returns with minimum investments. Leveraging upon small investment required in option, trader can earn equal or better profits than investing in actual stock itself which may need high investments.</p>
<p><strong>Trading with market movements</strong></p>
<p>Usually what traders try to predict is “is the market going to fall or rise?” before investing in a stock or taking a position. But with options one can even take advantage of situations when the markets are flat and not taking either of the directions.</p>
<p>In the end one of the best advantages with options trading is: investor is not obliged to buy or sell so he may choose not to exercise his rights and let go off of the premium paid, based on the prevailing market price of the stock. So if the current market price of the underlying asset seems more lucrative then the trader can choose to take a position by spot trading and not by exercising his rights through options trading.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have heard a lot of people saying that “I want to quit my job and start working for myself and not for someone else.” One might have definitely heard about <a title="Options Trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">Options Trading</a>, it is also a money making activity to consider while looking out for a business opportunity. Options trading offer excellent returns on your investments and remain to be hottest venture. One may ask what information you will require to get a better idea about options. Which features make options low risk investments? What are the different ways and strategies one needs to be aware about to gain maximum benefit out of Options Trading? Read further and discover about how this trading venture has an edge over other business undertakings.</p>
<p><strong>Options Trading Simplified</strong></p>
<p>This type of financial instrument is focused on the investors who would like to invest in a stock at a price higher or lower than the prevailing or current market price, that too for a certain time period. If a trader is bullish about the markets, he/she can look at a higher price for that stock by trading options. As there is a time period involved with this type of trading, investors can take their positions and wait for the markets to act in their favor within the stipulated time period.</p>
<p>While trading options if the trend is predicted correctly one can earn huge returns, however if the markets are unstable and it’s hard to predict that the markets are going to fall or rise one has to bear losses.</p>
<p><strong>Nature of Trading</strong></p>
<p>With options one can either choose to deal in a particular stock or multiple stocks from different sectors. For some who chooses to trade in one particular stock has more risks since fluctuations in the price of this particular company’s stock will directly affect their whole investments. On the other side they can choose to invest in multiple companies from different sectors, which help in keeping the bottom line in green even though some of the stocks are not performing in their favor.</p>
<p>Additionally, with options one can limit their risks by hedging their positions but still the possibilities to earn unlimited profit remains. It’s a great strategy to trade in options together with investing in the underlying asset. At times with options one can also find arbitrage opportunities with which you can earn profits with as good as no risk.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some traders believe in only venturing into familiar waters and stay away from the unknown. So is the case while choosing a financial instrument for investment purposes. Traders are more comfortable with investing in equity since it’s easy for them to understand simple ups and downs in the value of equity in comparison to <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a> which is relatively hard to understand. However, if little effort is taken then options can provide great advantages over equity trading or any other trading instruments out there. Some of the advantages are as described below:</p>
<p>Leverage</p>
<p>In options trading an investor has a right to buy or sell the respective stock at a future date, an agreed upon price and for this facility he pays a premium. For example: If a trader buys 500 stocks of $40 each he is supposed to pay $20,000 for that transaction. But if he buys 5 contracts of call option at $10 premium then he pays $5,000 only, so he can invest remaining $15,000 somewhere else and still get those 500 stocks at the agreed upon price immaterial of the current market value. Of course the trader needs to understand the market and options mechanism and then buy an option that best suits his/her beliefs. It may seem that options are hard to understand, but once you get a grip on them they are actually low risk investments which can give high returns.</p>
<p>Limited Risk</p>
<p>It’s an old belief that more risk you take more returns you would get. However, things are different when talking about options trading. The way how options are designed, if the positions are correctly taken then one can gain maximum returns while the risk remains limited. One of the reasons why this is possible is because with options a trader buys a right to buy or sell a stock by paying a small premium on the contract. So in future if the market price of the underlying asset falls below the strike price then the trader can choose to let the contract expire and ignore the premium he has paid. On the other side if the market price of that particular stock is more that the strike price, then trader can exercise his right and buy those stocks at an agreed upon strike price.</p>
<p>There are lots of different possibilities while trading options so if an extra effort is made to better understand options it can do wonders to your portfolio.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today’s investors have multiple financial instruments to choose from such as mutual funds, bonds, commodities, stocks and exchange traded funds. But the range of securities does not end there, one other type of instrument is known as ‘<em>options’</em> which provides a great investment prospects for the traders.</p>
<p>Below are some of the <a title="fundamentals of Options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/options-trading-basics/fundamentals-of-options-trading/">fundamentals of Options trading</a>:</p>
<p>1.)    Option is a type of contract between the buyer and the seller, where in buyer of the option contract has a right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a certain price but is not obliged. Since the buyer is not obliged to exercise his rights he may choose to wait for the contract to expire without acting upon it.</p>
<p>2.)    There are two types of Options namely Call and Put. With Call Option trader gets a right to buy an underlying asset where as in case of Put Option trader gets a right to sell an underlying asset.</p>
<p>3.)    Every Option contract has a lot size associated with it. And since traders are buying a right to buy or sell and not the actual underlying asset the Options are being traded at premium price for a contract and not the stock price of the lot. So for example: if the underlying asset is being traded at $49 in the market and premium on its $ 49 strike price Call option is $2 for a lot size of 1000, then a trader who chooses to buy the Call Options today is supposed to pay only $2000 per contract instead of paying $49,000 for buying 1000 stocks at $49 each.</p>
<p>4.)    Further, at the end of the Call Option contract period if a trader wishes to actually buy the stock only at that time he/she is supposed to pay the total amount of $49,000 as per the example referred in point number 4. So near the expiry of the contract even if the market price of the stock has climbed up to $52 still the trader has a right to buy that particular stock at $49.</p>
<p>5.)    So if the buyer of Call option chooses to execute his rights then the opposite party in the contract is obliged to sell his holdings of the underlying asset at the agreed upon price.</p>
<p>6.)    In the same way if the buyer of Put option chooses to execute his rights then the opposite party in the contract is obliged to buy the underlying asset.</p>
<p>7.)    On the other side if the buyer of the option chooses not to exercise his rights, in that case the seller of the contract can retain the premium as profits.</p>
<p>8.)    While calculating the profits and losses one needs to keep in mind premium paid for buying an option contract and the strike price. So if the premium on the option is $5 and the strike price is $110, trader’s break-even point is at $115. If the trader wants to make profits the stock prices should stay above $115. On the other side if the stock price falls to $108 the trader is not losing $7 but he/she can forget about the premium paid and bear the loss of $5 per stock.</p>
<p>Keeping the above mentioned fundamentals in mind one can at least better understand how the market forces work for <a title="options trading" href="http://www.optiontradebasics.com/Getting-Started-With-Options">options trading</a>.</p>
