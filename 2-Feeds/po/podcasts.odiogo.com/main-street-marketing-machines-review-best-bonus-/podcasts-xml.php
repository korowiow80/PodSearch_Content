<h1>The Sales Pitch Video</h1>
<h1>Persuasion Vs Manipulation</h1>
<p><a href="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/google.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-128" title="The Sales Pitch Video | Persuasion Vs Manipulation" src="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/google-300x238.png" alt="The Sales Pitch Video | Persuasion Vs Manipulation" width="300" height="238" /></a>﻿﻿In this article I will walk you through a great script for your sales video.  This is just a template that you should adjust according to your own character and target group.  Don’t worry if you don’t get this perfect on the first take, it takes practice and patience, but if the right components are there you will get the results you want.</p>
<p>It is a basic sales and video marketing tactic to begin with what is called a “pattern interrupt”, say something important and even shocking if you can to get your viewer’s attention.  This could be the classic “you are going to miss out” line or anything else you might think will create an emotional response from your potential client.  A line like this answers the question your viewer has going in to the video which is “Why should I care about what you have to tell me?”. Well if your answer is “If you don’t buy my services then your competitor will and he will be getting 50 new leads a week.” Now they care, don’t they?</p>
<p>It is the general concept of the sales video to lift any disbeliefs the viewer has going in to video and answer all the basic questions that emerge throughout.  The next question into the prospects mind usually is “But I know my business and this is not how we do it, how are you doing it?”.  People don’t like change, they feel comfortable living in a stable environment and you are rocking the boat.  This is where your “results ahead” approach is paying off.  By talking about the leads you have already create through your site you can prove that the system works and that “they” could be getting the same number of new leads week in week out if they pay you enough.</p>
<p>As every good story and movie has a hero and a villain so should your sales video.  Its time now to introduce your villain and that is none other than the traditional advertising media that just don’t work.  Everyone pays to get into the yellow pages with no return or puts an ad in a newspaper and still nothing, not like your system, the hero, that has a proven track record and is ready to use and provide new leads from day one.  You should come across as having magic powers, most of your prospects will not be familiar with what you are proposing, and should be left speech less with your results.  Sketch out their needs and how you fulfill those needs.  Make strong points so that they can go home and sell it to their wives or husbands, walk them through a screen capture of the Google results page you are on, make them understand how important it is for your site to be there and try to quantify your results so that they are easier to grasp.</p>
<p>Lastly create scarcity for yourself, make sure you say something like “I will only work with one person in each area or niche” or that you can only take on a limited number of clients, they should feel as if they are going to be missing out on something really great.  People don&#8217;t want to be let down so you must show them absolute truth and relieve any objection they might have and now give them a call to action.  Ask them to call you or send you an email or complete a form.  Whatever it is it must be clear and unique.</p>

<h1>Here&#8217;s an overview of the video and audio equipment</h1>
<p><a href="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tg1-copy.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-114" title="All The Video & Audio Equipment You Need" src="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tg1-copy-300x170.png" alt="All The Video & Audio Equipment You Need" width="300" height="170" /></a></p>
<p>This is just the basic setup, Mike Koenigs proposes you use when you want to create great professional looking videos.</p>
<p>So let’s get to it:</p>
<p>First of all you will need a computer.  These days even modest hardware PC configurations support video editing, Macs are even better at this and Mike is a huge Mac fan but if you are using a PC, like me, rest assured the result is pretty much the same on both machines.  If you can afford it you should get some kind of teleprompter software although you could get away without one and just using Powerpoint or Keynote (on the Mac) to display your notes while you are recording your video.  It is my opinion that in the beginning it would probably be best for you to just use the presentation software anyway since you could only put your script bullet points on there and that would make you sound more natural where as having everything written on your teleprompter could make you sound a little bit mechanical at least until you get the hang of it.</p>
<p>You will of course need a camera.  You could obviously use a web cam but the result will most probably be under par.  What you would ideally want to use is a high definition camera with an external microphone input.  The price range for this specification is quite wide but a great and affordable choice is the Kodak Zi8, it’s a great compact, camera, comes in lot’s of nice colors, it has the external microphone input and its video quality is really really good.  If you are a PC user you might need to transcode the video to a different format in order to edit it but this can be done with free utilities such as MPEG StreamClip.</p>
<p>The whole point of your camera having an external microphone input is for you to be able to use one of those small lapel microphones.  These come with a long enough wire to run under your shirt and clip it to your shirt.  Not only does it look professional and allows for you to move around but it also sounds professional.  A great and affordable choice is the Audio Technica ATR-2250 microphone.  The only problem you might encounter with this microphone is running out of batteries since it uses hearing aid batteries and if you forget to turn it off at some point you mind find that it has run out of juice next time you try to use it, so you might want to pay a bit more and get one that doesn’t need batteries.</p>
<p>You will also need a tripod to set your camera on.  It should be able to raise the camera up to your eye level and maybe be even a few inches higher.  A great choice is the Manfrotto 785b which is high enough, very light but sturdy, goes through security and is affordable.</p>
<p>To edit the videos you shoot you can use Screenflow for the Mac or Camtasia which is available both for the Mac and the PC.  The editing process is a bit easier and streamlined on the Mac but the result will be, as I mentioned earlier, the same on both platforms.</p>
<p>A last thing you might want to add to your setup is a Blue Yeti USB microphone.  It is a table top microphone you can use to record audio voiceovers for your screen capture videos or webinars.  It provides great quality recordings that can’t be matched by the built-in microphone of your laptop.</p>
<p>A last piece of advice is to try and record your videos under reasonably good lighting conditions and invest in a set of lights and a green screen as soon as you can.  It is an investment that will multiple the value of your videos since you will be able to create even more professional looking videos.</p>

<p>Let me just remind you that this series of articles is just an overview of the things you are taught by Mike Koenigs and his team in the <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">Main Street marketing Machines</a> (<a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">MSMM</a>) course.  Mike is a great guy and knowing the industry well has created a number of tools that help you achieve your goals.<br />
One of these tools is <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a> and this is the one you will need to use in order to create great looking lead pages.  It supports an unlimited number of profiles and has a large number of great looking templates for you to work with.<br />
Choosing your template is the first thing you need to do.  There is a list inside <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a> with thumbnails next to them and you can choose which one you like best.  I would suggest you choose a relatively simple one because it has been proven that the simpler lead in pages are the most converting.  Having chosen your template you are now ready to create your page.  When creating your lead page make sure you choose a keyword rich page name, it is very important that you do so.  Page name is very important to ranking and so is the title the page is going to display, so choose wisely.  Let me give you a piece of advice here, when you are writing all your copy and deciding on the titles etc please do it offline in a text editor.  Save the content and then begin populating your page, you would not want your browser crashing just before you have finished writing a great five hundred word article straight into one of the available text boxes and losing all your work.  It would be a shame don’t you think?  Anyway, once you have put in all your text, set up the colors, fonts etc on the page you can save it and go to the next step which is creating a video to put on your lead page, people love video, so it is necessary to do so.  You might think it is difficult but wait until the next article and you will read the techniques Mike teaches you in <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">MSMM</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tg7.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-124" title="MSMM Training: How To Get A Domain Name" src="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tg7.png" alt="MSMM Training: How To Get A Domain Name" width="500" height="117" /></a>Almost every Internet Marketing specialist will advise you to spend time on how to get a domain name and chose wisely!!</p>
<p>As you have read in my previous post I described how <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">Main Street Marketing Machines</a> teaches you to create a free report on the niche you have chosen using the tools within <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a>.  The next thing Mike Koenigs shows you in great detail is how to publish a lead page on the internet.  In order to achieve this there are several things you need to do.</p>
<p>First, try to find an available keyword loaded domain name and buy it.  There is a great number of registrars on the internet but Mike, and I incidentally, endorse <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">Godaddy.com</a>.  It has competitive pricing with great offers available all the time and extra services you might at some point need.  Since your lead page is targeted at the local market and a particular niche, the best domain would be a combination of location and business with a .com extension.  I’m saying that because even if some might say that a .com and .biz domain can rank the same in the search engines, the people that are going to be looking at the search results returned for their query trust the .com extension more than the .biz.  So in my opinion it would be better to have a less keyword loaded .com domain than a fully keyword loaded .biz domain.  Another point I would like to make since lots of people are asking this is about dashes in the URL, so far there doesn’t seem to be a penalization by the search engines on URLs but their algorithms change daily and you can’t know for sure that this will be the case tomorrow or next month. Hence f you can, grab the domain name without the dashes.</p>
<p>One thing you should know about <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">Godaddy.com</a> is that they have a, hmm how should I put this, a strong “up-sell” policy.  This means that they will try to sell you quite a lot of products along with the domain you are registering.  In case you are using Traffic Geyser you do not need any of these products since Mike and his team provide hosting for you.  Last time round Mike was saying that they were working on enhancing their services and sometime soon they are hoping to be able to register the domain name with them at a competitive price and not having to register it at godaddy.com.</p>
<p>One thing I would like to say about <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">Main Street Marketing Machines</a> is that it caters for both the experienced internet user and the complete newbie.  It takes everything one step at a time but also gives you advanced tips that even the most experienced might not know.<br />
If you do not want <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a> to host your lead page you can set up your domain on your hosting, create the lead page as we will see in the next article and then upload it using FTP, which is embedded in <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a>, to your hosting provider.</p>

<p><a href="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tg3.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-112 alignleft" title="MSMM Training: Create Value And Give It To People For FREE!" src="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tg3-300x169.png" alt="MSMM Training: Create Value And Give It To People For FREE!" width="300" height="169" /></a></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/index.php/how-to-find-your-niche/">previous post</a> I described the process <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">MSMM</a> teaches you for distinguish your niche between all the available opportunities using the very useful Opportunity Finder tool inside the <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a> platform but let us now see how you can create value for your customers.</p>
<p>The MSMM system Mike Koenigs and his team have develop is all about generating leads from the internet for Main Street businesses and here is how they propose you go about it after you have chosen your niche.</p>
<p>Inside the <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a> platform you can find a number of templates for free reports.  You choose the one that is closer to your niche and create based on this template a free report you will be giving to the people that come to your site having performed a keyword rich search on <a href="www.google.com">Google.com</a>.  In order to give it to them for free as promised though, you ask them for their full name, email address and any other information you might think might be of interest to your prospective clients.  This way you can start generating results even before you approach someone to sell them your services.</p>
<p>In order to fill in the blanks in the report template you need a bit of inspiration, of course, and some original and interesting facts about your niche.  The easiest way to find these facts is by looking around <a href="www.google.com">Google.com</a> and <a href="www.youtube.com">YouTube.com</a> for content relevant to your niche.  Having gathered enough data you write your report, fill in the headlines, contents etc and your free report is almost ready.</p>
<p>In order to complete your report you need to do two things, first of all find some great artwork and photos to make the report look professional and stylish.  Be careful though because most photos and clipart on the internet is not royalty free, in order to minimize the chances of someone asking you for royalties because you used one of their images for commercial purposes you can do an advanced image search on <a href="http://www.google.com/advanced_image_search?hl=en">Google.com</a> and ask the search engine to return royalty-free images only.  You can also use small pictures from <a href="www.istockphoto.com">iStockPhotos.com</a> for free or pay a certain amount to use the full resolution pictures.</p>
<p>The second thing you should do is brand the report with your colors, logos and mottos if you have them as you will your lead page, this way if you create a second or even more you will create a name for yourself and be able to monetize all the effort better.</p>
<p>The last step in the process is for you to convert your report into PDF format using any of the <a href="http://www.google.gr/search?rlz=1C1SKPC_enGR362&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=pdf+converter">converter tools</a> out there and upload it to <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a> so that it is ready for distribution.</p>

<h1>Main Street Marketing Machines (MSMM) teaches you how to use all the available tools to find your niche</h1>
<p><a href="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tg6.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-118 alignleft" title="Main Street Marketing Machines (MSMM)   How To Find Your Niche" src="http://MainStreetMarketingMachinesiPadBonus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/tg6-300x108.png" alt="Main Street Marketing Machines (MSMM)   How To Find Your Niche" width="300" height="108" /></a></p>
<p>How easy it is to find your niche? <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">Main Street Marketing Machines</a> <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">(MSMM)</a> is a course offered by Mike Koenigs that transforms you into a Main Street Marketing Expert.  Mike shows you how to use all the available tools in <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a>, the platform they have designed and use, in order to become a Main street marketing expert.  The first tool you get to use is the Opportunity Finder.</p>
<p>It is a very helpful tool within <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a> that will help you to choose the initial niche/business and location you will work in as well as every time you are looking to expand into new territory.</p>
<p>You could approach this tool from many different directions.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have already made up your mind that you would like to work at geographical locations near your place of residence or maybe you are knowledgeable in a particular niche and you know you can apply your experience using <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">MSMM</a> and don’t care about geographical location or you are open to all possibilities and are willing to go wherever the best opportunity is, in any case this tool will give you a measure of the “hunger” for your services in any particular niche and location.</p>
<p>As far as the use of the tool, it is pretty straightforward.  The first necessary step is for you to choose a location, you can always come back at this stage later in the process to change it if you want, and then choose Business type.  Based on these criteria you get a list with information on keywords, search results, Cost per click, paid ads and questions asked.</p>
<p>From this information you can see what the market for the niche and location you have chosen looks like.  You can hence choose keywords with low completion and increase your chances of rating high, look for low cost per click, if there are many local ads you might think it’s a bad thing but it is actually a good thing since it means that people in the location you have chosen are paying money to be promoted in that niche.</p>
<p>Having made your mind up you then move onto the last step of the process where the <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Opportunity Finder</a> gives you a list of rated prospects.  Can you believe that?  It’s a list of people or businesses that could become your customers if only you approach them with the results of your lead site.  Except for all the expected information such as name, address, telephone number and email address you get a rating for each prospect, the higher the rating the better has been the experience of customers having dealt with that prospect, it’s easy to understand that if the customers are satisfied you will probably be dealing with a good person or a well run company and hence you can more easily do business with them.</p>
<p>Having this information handy you are ready to go out and get them to pay you for all the leads you will produce for them.</p>

Before I had a chance to learn all the information Mike has put into this course I had no idea of what I could do if I had the right tools.</p>
<p>That’s one of the first things Mike teaches you in <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">MSMM</a>, you need to have high productivity tools to be able to manage all your clients and produce great results, but <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">MSMM</a> gives you not only the tools but a System as well.  A system to produce consistently high quality leads for your clients and monetizing those leads.</p>
<p>Mike’s approach with <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">MSMM</a> works for newbies as well as experienced marketers and he always over delivers when he teaches or answers questions for everyone on his courses.  He has a “results in advance” approach that allows you to go to prospective clients with proof in your hands that the system works.</p>
<p>Here’s an overview of his approach:<br />
1.	You pick a niche or business field you would like to promote<br />
2.	Create a lead page for that niche<br />
3.	Get results<br />
4.	Go to the client with numbers and statistics showing him what you can deliver</p>
<p>The great tool that you use to achieve results from this approach is of course <a href="http://www.TrafficGeyser.com/cmd.php?af=27873">Traffic Geyser</a>.  It’s a full featured content management system that allows you to automate much of the process and to manage an unlimited number of customer profiles but with a twist.  Because it is specifically design for <a href="http://www.mainstreetmarketingmachinesipadbonus.com/default.aspx?ref=bpmsmm">MSMM</a> it has some great features that practically guarantee a great Return On Investment.</p>
<p>Most importantly, it helps you determine which niche you should choose to work on with the help of Opportunity Finder.  This tool contains information extracted from various sources on many different business sectors.  The information included is based on the location you would like to work on and is about the search results for the relevant keywords, the cost per click, the number of paid ads, the questions asked and even the prospects relating to the niche you would like to pursue. By interpreting this information correctly, and this is not an easy thing but Mike helps you a lot to get a feeling for the correct approach, you can choose your niche with great conviction that you will succeed.</p>
<p>For example when reviewing the relevant keywords you could choose low completion keywords and concentrate on the local area searches instead of the total number of searches to get a better feeling for the local “hunger” for your services.</p>
<p>Having chosen your niche with the “Opportunity Finder” you would now be ready to create all the internet content necessary to get all the leads for your clients by creating a free report, getting a domain name and hosting it, setting up a lead page, create videos and start generating results!</p>
