      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bible study site Biblefixit.com has released the information that it is now set to commence serving the online masses. Up til now the site has &amp;quot;lain fallow&amp;quot;, says the website's maker, Pastor Red Baxter, while he, of necessity, gave his attention to other things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site's thrust is to teach folks &lt;a href="http://biblefixit.com/how-to-study-the-bible.htm" rel="nofollow"&gt;how to study the bible&lt;/a&gt;. A premiere tool presented to scriptural learners is the site's &amp;quot;Bible Trivia Contest&amp;quot;, wherein all folks are allowed to participate, but small givers can get a $100 cash prize, as a compensation for displaying their grasp of &lt;a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/TGoodenough1#videoId=xkpfq4" rel="nofollow"&gt;bible facts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gifts, by contestants for the cash prize, are put to use to support the growth of a society named the &amp;quot;Tru U. Bible Brotherhood&amp;quot;. It is named the &amp;quot;Tru U.&amp;quot; for convenience. The reason for the Tru U. is to set up scripture teaching hours in people's houses, everywhere in the homeland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associates of the Tru U. Bible Brotherhood will become scripturally knowledgeable helpers, in centers called &amp;quot;Bible Fixit Hubs&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pastor Red Baxter is known as a presbyter, or elder, of the order of Paul. In other words his authority is from direct revelation, rather than from the seminaries of the world order, which have, in the last few centuries, gone astray, says Pastor Baxter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trivia competitions take place in an online chat room. Questions are entered by the Biblefixit.com helpers. Whoever fastest keys the right answer gets the point. The contest ends, when one giver-player gets a 4-point margin beyond his leading competitor, who is also a donor. The front-runner is sent their $100 prize without delay, as soon as the game is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biblefixit.com is an action-oriented site. There is a web page about destroying idols, and a page about ways to identify the descendants of Ammon and Moab in our own world, and how the holy scripture tells us to treat them. In addition to those pages, you will find also a web page on How To Study The Bible&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, if you desire to view the website for yourself, even participate for free in the trivia contest, the URL is biblefixit.com .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/tgoodenough1s-personal-blog-on-bloggersbase/TGoodenough1s_personal_blog_on_BloggersBase-How_To_Study_The_Bible_And_Win_100.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Making it easier to learn how to study the Bible, there are certain teachings, that will help you, if you know them before you study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not Too Hard To Weed Out Some Folks, Who Only Think They Are Servants Of Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You and I prefer to obey the Bible, not just read it. Therefore we will have to know who, in our own life, isn&amp;rsquo;t a follower of Jesus, and who is a worshipper of Christ. First, I&amp;rsquo;ll teach to you an easy way to recognize anybody, who possibly might even regularly go to a church house, yet who is not a Christian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul the Apostle of Christ wrote the following words in his epistle to a man who was known as John:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 John&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 ;22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The words, &amp;ldquo;Christ&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Messiah&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;Anointed&amp;rdquo; all mean the same idea. They refer to the rite of pouring oil over the head, of a new king or high priest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the verse above, if a soul denies that Jesus is high priest and king, then they deny that Jesus is identical with The Father, and they are not a servant of Jesus Christ. Likewise, if they deny that Christ is The Heavenly Father in the flesh, then they are not a servant of Jesus Christ. Those notions are implicit in the above Bible's verse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next Way Of Identifying A Non-Genuine Servants Of Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of human beings think that they are followers of Jesus, and many say that they love Jesus Christ, or that they have let him into their heart. But the holy scriptures, below, inform us that some of those creatures might not be servants of Jesus Christ, despite what they say about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the following Scriptural verses, it is Jesus Christ himself speaking to us:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew 7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21 Not every person that says unto me, Lord, Lord, shall go into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father who is in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;22 Many people will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, haven't we prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: leave from me, you lawless creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John 14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;21 He who hath my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loveth me: and he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;23 &amp;hellip; If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our home with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;24 He that doesn't love me keepeth not my words: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The verses from the Book of Isaiah, the prophet, below, make it clear to us how anybody can be a Christian person, if they make up their mind to be one, not just the children, of a man named Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A prophet is somebody who says what God told him to say. So, in effect, it is The Almighty God speaking. Remembering who isn&amp;rsquo;t or who is a Christian, in your life, can help you, when you are learning how to study the Bible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isaiah 56&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 Blessed is the man &amp;hellip; that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to Jahweh, speak, saying, the LORD has utterly separated me from his people&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&amp;ldquo;His people&amp;rdquo; = the children of a man named &amp;ldquo;Israel&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[&amp;ldquo;stranger&amp;rdquo; = not the spawn of a man named &amp;ldquo;Israel&amp;rdquo;]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful &amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8 The Lord Jahweh, which gathers the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the passage above, the word &amp;ldquo;Israel&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;the bloodline of a man named &amp;lsquo;Israel&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion is, anybody can be a Christian, if they choose to follow the sayings of Jesus, and his father, who are one in the same being. Part, of learning how to study the Bible, is how to know who isn&amp;rsquo;t or who is a worshipper of Christ in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How This Helps You&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many places in the Bible, we are told how to treat &amp;ldquo;unbelievers&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;the wicked&amp;rdquo;. If you get to one of those places, and you don&amp;rsquo;t know how to tell which is which, then how will you be able to apply the scripture in your own life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to find out how to study the Bible faster, and understand it?
