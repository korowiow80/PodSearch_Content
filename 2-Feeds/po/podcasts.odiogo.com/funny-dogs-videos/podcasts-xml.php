<p>One of my local dog groomers is called Doggy Style. It gets people&#039;s attention and is sure to get them talking. People will also never forget the name of it.</p>

<div style="margin:24px 0px 8px 0px;font-weight:bolder;">Suggestion:</div>
<p>You should play with her like you are grooming constantly. If you are watching tv, put her on your lap and play with her feet, rub them between the toes. Do the same with her face. Try combing her when she is relaxed and sitting quietly on your lap. Yorkies are usually antsy, but some extra handling may help her calm down a bit. All this should be done from a very early age to get dogs used to being handled and groomed.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Thank god, today we get to bring our beloved baby home from the vet, following his 3 days in recovery for having surgery to fix his poor leg&#8230;he suffered a horrible spiral fracture to his femur on Sunday night. We have been beside ourselves with worry and missing him for the past few days. For anyone who may have read my questions over the past 3 days since this happened, you know that this surgery ended up costing us over $2,000, which we could not afford and didn&#039;t have, and we had to make huge sacrifices and sell our business equipment to pay for Jack to get this surgery. <br />
We will definitely be eating Ramen noodles everyday for the next week or so! This has made us realize that buying a health insurance policy is absolutely necessary. Originally we declined getting insurance for him, since we don&#039;t even have insurance for ourselves and have to pay for all doctor/dentist visits for myself, my husband and our 2 kids in cash. The difference is, in an emergency, if we are tapped out, we can always bring ourselves or our kids to the emergency room, and they will provide care and bill us later. However, if a dog has an emergency, there is no ER that is obligated to provide care, and you&#039;d be hard pressed to find a vet that will bill you later. So, I now understand why pet insurance is critical, and I used GOOGLE to find several companies and get quotes. But they all seem so wildly different! Does anyone have a great pet insurance policy from a company they would recommend? How do deductibles work? Generally, what do these policies cover? Obviously I know that they won&#039;t cover any future problems Jack has with the bone plate and intramedullary pin used to repair his femur, but what if, god forbid, he sustained another unrelated injury to the same leg? He is only 6 months old, and his breed (MinPin) is notorious for having fragile bones. Also, what is a reasonable range to expect to pay monthly? I can probably budget about $30-$40 per month for his insurance (which is nothing compared to the $840 per month we were quoted for HUMAN health insurance!)&#8230; Can I get a decent policy for that much? Any advice would be awesome.</p>
<div style="margin:24px 0px 8px 0px;font-weight:bolder;">Suggestion:</div>
<p>I had the same kind of situation a number of years ago with one of our dogs.  5K out of our pocket.  We told ourselves we were going to get insurance on our next pets!  We currently have 2 dogs covered by Healthy Paws Pet Insurance (www.healthypawspetinsurance.com).  Only one small claim so far (thank goodness!), but they seem to genuinely care and have a quick responding customer service department.  They also have a foundation that supports rescue/adoptions groups with cash grants!</p>
<p>I&#039;m going to bullet some of the questions you have and answer them with what I know:</p>
<p>1 &#8211; deductibles &#8211; Healthy Paws has annual deductible as low as $100.  Once you meet it, no more deductible for that year (for this company, it policy year, not actual calendar year).  How it works for other companies is a great question to ask if that particular company doesn&#039;t have it specified on their site.<br />
2 &#8211; Healthy Paws covers all accidents, injuries, medications, diagnostics.  Does not cover preventative care/wellness (annual shots, flea control, heart worm meds).  ALL pet insurance companies do not cover pre-existing conditions, so your question about something that happened to that leg is a GREAT question to ask any company you&#039;re interested in.<br />
3 &#8211; our dogs were like 3 and 4 when we enrolled them and they are around $35/ea.  Almost all pet insurance sites have ability to get a free quote so you&#039;ll know exactly what it will cost you.</p>
<p>I also used Pet Insurance Review (www.petinsurancereveiw.com) to do alot of my research.  An unbiased site where customers of pet insurance companies who have filed claims get to rate their companies. One of the other posts had some great questions to ask when you get down to the companies you&#039;re interested in.  Good stuff!!  </p>
<p>Hope this helps and that Jack makes a full recovery!!</p>

Spurred to move by a housing crisis in Los Angeles, Steven, Lila, and their eight dogs-then ten, then twenty, and then they lost count-bought a postage-stamp-size farm in Chimayo, New Mexico. A Small Furry Prayer chronicles their adventures at Rancho de Chihuahua, the sanctuary they created for their special needs pack. While dog rescue is one of the largest underground movements in America, it is also one of the least understood. An insider look at the &#8220;cult and culture&#8221; of dog rescue, A Small Furry Prayer weaves personal experience, cultural investigation, and scientific inquiry into a fast-paced, fun-filled narrative that explores what it means to devote one&#8217;s life to the furry and the four-legged. Along the way, Kotler combs through every aspect of canine-human relations, from humans&#8217; long history with dogs through brand-new research into the neuroscience of canine companionship, in the end discovering why living in a world made of dog may be the best way to uncover the truth about what it really means to be human.</p>
