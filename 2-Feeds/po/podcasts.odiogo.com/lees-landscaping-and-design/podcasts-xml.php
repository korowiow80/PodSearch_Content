      <description>Surface erosion due to water runoff is one of the major causes of landscaping problems. Not only can it have a negative effect on the environment and the aesthetic look of your landscape design, but it can also reduce crop productivity as erosion involves wind and water carrying off fertile layers of top soil. Water runoff leads to water pollution as contaminants like fertilizers and herbicides drain into water sources instead of naturally filtering through the soil. However, you can lessen or avert erosion with proper landscaping. By making the right choices in your landscape design, you can positively affect the environment in addition to enhancing the look of your landscaping.

Not only can it have a negative effect on the environment and the aesthetic look of your landscape design, but it can also reduce crop productivity as erosion involves wind and water carrying off fertile layers of top soil. Water runoff leads to water pollution as contaminants like fertilizers and herbicides drain into water sources instead of naturally filtering through the soil. However, you can lessen or avert erosion with proper landscaping. By making the right choices in your landscape design, you can positively affect the environment in addition to enhancing the look of your landscaping.</p>
<h2>Use A Permeable Pavement</h2>
<p>An excellent alternative to traditional pavement, permeable pavers can handle the same heavy loads. However, instead of water running off them as with regular pavement, permeable pavers allow water to filter through the permeable surface. By including permeable pavers in your landscaping, you can help preserve the quality and cleanliness of our limited water supply. Through absorption and filtering, this alternative to traditional pavement helps to naturally clean water of harmful contaminants, recharging your groundwater resources. These permeable pavers will also reduce the stress on waterways and storm drains, which will lessen the effect of floodwaters.</p>
<h2>Creating Rain Gardens</h2>
<p>A great landscaping method for reducing runoff, rain gardens catch the water in a shallow ground depression. Rain gardens can protect your local water resources from contamination of hazardous materials, whether a creek, river, or lake. A rain garden catches water runoff, filtering it into the ground instead of sending it off to a storm drain. These gardens also help contribute to increasing your groundwater resources. The perfect addition to a beautiful landscape design, rain gardens add to the attractiveness of your landscaping, are practically maintenance free, and provide a habitat for wildlife and plants.</p>
<h2>Absorbing Roof Runoff With Foundation Plants</h2>
<p>A popular basic of <a href="http://leeslandscapes.com/" >landscape design</a>, foundation plants can do a whole lot more than look pretty. Foundation plants accomplish wonders for stopping the erosion of your lawn due to roof runoff. Choose foundation plants with root systems that won&#8217;t overpower the foundation of your home. In addition, plan your planting locations carefully to ensure locating them where they will receive the most water from your roof, such as where your gutters empty. Foundation plants are a simple and traditional way to prevent water runoff and beautify your landscape design.</p>
<h2>Installing A Green Roof</h2>
<p>An addition to an existing roof, a green roof includes a thriving root repellant system along with waterproofing so you can grow lightweight to medium weight plants on the roof of your home. Green roofs offer aesthetic, ecological, and economical benefits, including prolonging the lifespan of your roofing material by providing a buffer of plants. These plants also help you save money on your heating and cooling costs. Especially in urban areas, green roofs offer a habitat for plants and animals that may not otherwise have a home in a busy suburban or urban area.</p>
<p>By including the above techniques in your Minneapolis landscaping, <a href="http://leeslandscapes.com/" >Minnesota landscape design</a>, or landscaping anywhere else in the world, you will beautify your home with smart landscape design while helping to reverse environmental damage.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the right plants in your landscape design offers you the opportunity to improve the look of the landscaping around your home or business while also helping the environment and conserving water. With today&#8217;s concerns about the climate and water usage, it&#8217;s important for everyone to practice water conservation, whether living in a drought prone part of the world or not. This is especially important for those living in North America as more than 50% of the residential water use goes toward lawns and landscaping. With the need for better water conservation techniques in landscape design more evident than ever, this post provides some tips on conserving water while maintaining the beautiful landscaping around your home or business.</p>
<p><strong>Xeriscape Design</strong></p>
<p>A landscaping technique designed for drought prone areas, xeriscaping is now widespread because it provides for easy maintenance without the need for pesticides or fertilizers. This integrated method for conserving water and maintaining a beautiful landscape includes analyzing the contours of the land while considering the purpose, look desired, and climate to create a landscape design that also conserves water.</p>
<p>An important part of xeriscaping involves choosing the best plants. For example, it&#8217;s not a good idea to use plants indigenous to a wetland area in an area that doesn&#8217;t receive enough water, but choosing plants adjusted to hot, dry summers for a Minnesota <a href="http://leeslandscapes.com/" >landscape design</a> is a great choice. With xeriscaping, you choose plants either native to your local area or drought resistant plants like plants native to the southwest. Drought resistant plants have several characteristics in common, including small, thick, glossy leaves. Planting trees near drought resistant plants will shade them from the sun and reduce water evaporation.</p>
<p><strong>Water The Roots</strong></p>
<p>All plants, especially trees, take in water through their base, or roots, and not through their leaves. This means it is best to water your plants at the base. While popular, sprinklers waste a lot of water because the water lands on the leaves of a plant. This water doesn&#8217;t benefit the plant in any way and eventually just evaporates.</p>
<p>Soak new plants by placing a hose at the base so the water gets to the roots of the plant. Watering deeply for a shorter time is better than sprinkling a plant frequently. Soak new plants, especially trees, to encourage root absorption and reduce soil erosion. Vary this watering method depending on the needs and sizes of your plants. This is also a great reason why you shouldn&#8217;t place plants with varying water needs next to each other in your landscaping because you will waste water on plants that don&#8217;t need as much water.</p>
<p><strong>Time To Water</strong></p>
<p>Choosing the best time to water is another important aspect of water conservation in landscape design. To minimize evaporation, don&#8217;t water your plants between 10AM and 6PM. The best way to implement a schedule is by setting a timer on a drip irrigation system within your landscape design to run early in the morning or in the evening after sundown.</p>
<p>Whether used in Atlanta gardens or <a href="http://leeslandscapes.com/" >Minneapolis landscaping</a>, practicing water conservation can help improve the environment while beautifying your landscape.</p>

While the health of trees and plants in a landscape design is vital to the beauty of a home, it does place a strain on water supplies, locally and worldwide. This post offers some great tips for conserving water while maintaining the beautiful plants and trees in your landscape.</p>
<h2>Finding The Best Irrigation Method</h2>
<p>Americans typically use one of the following three methods of irrigation: drip irrigation, hand watering, and sprinklers, with sprinklers being the most common irrigation method used. However, it is crucial to consider the needs of your landscape and reducing water usage when choosing the best irrigation method for you.</p>
<p>While sprinklers can save time and are inexpensive to purchase, they do waste a lot of water because they spray water at the leaves instead of the roots. This means most of the water isn&#8217;t absorbed as the water on the leaves evaporates. By hand watering, you deliver water to the exact area needed and you can monitor the moisture before watering, allowing you to reduce the amount of water used. Unfortunately, with a large landscape, hand watering is labor intensive and time consuming.</p>
<p>You can target your water delivery with drip irrigation, although not as accurately as with hand watering. However, drip irrigation saves time as it effectively delivers water to your plants, but it is the most expensive option.</p>
<h2>Watering For Best Results</h2>
<p>You should water your plants at their roots for best results. Watering the leaves not only wastes water that will just eventually evaporate, it can lead to a number of fungal diseases. If you can&#8217;t keep water at the roots of your plants because of runoff, consider repositioning your plant, analyzing whether it has enough soil around the base, or whether it might be too close to paved areas. If runoff remains a problem, apply water in short cycles, giving your plants time in between to absorb the water before watering again.</p>
<p>In addition, look at the soil around your plants, considering whether it is indigenous to your area. Clay is slow to absorb water, but it retains more water. Sandy soil takes in water quickly, but it dries out and erodes easily, making it a bad choice for water conservation. You can add organic matter to your soil to improve its ability to hold water. Shade trees and mulch help as well because they halt evaporation and prevent weeds from growing in your <a href="http://leeslandscapes.com/" >landscape design</a>.</p>
<h2>When To Water</h2>
<p>You can conserve a huge amount of water simply by watering at the right time of day. Watering in the early morning or in the late evening at dusk or after sundown will work to reduce the amount of evaporation that occurs when watering during the day from 10AM to 6PM. Consider whether you really need to water on windy days as water loss increases with higher winds. By monitoring the weather and resetting timers, you can also conserve water. A rain gauge helps in deciding how much water your plants might need, whether for arid Albuquerque, New Mexico, landscaping or a milder Minneapolis <a href="http://leeslandscapes.com/" >landscape</a>.</p>
<p>From Oregon to Virginia and Florida to Minnesota landscape design, all areas of the country can benefit from these simple tips that will help reduce the water used while not sacrificing the beauty of your landscaping.</p>

<p>MINNEAPOLIS, MN – Popular <a href="http://www.leeslandscapes.com" >Minneapolis landscaping services firm</a>, Lee’s Landscaping and Design, Inc., recently announced five useful tips to help homeowners maintain pristine lawns throughout the Spring months. By following the firm’s practical lawn maintenance tips, it is expected that homeowners will enjoy vibrant and healthy looking lawns with minimal investment in time or money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Spring can be a beautiful time of year for yards in Minneapolis, but often not without some simple maintenance. By following my five Spring maintenance tips, homeowners will soon find that they can have lush, beautiful lawns with very little effort or investment,&#8221; says Lee Otto, owner of Lee’s Landscaping and Design (<a href="http://www.leeslandscapes.com" >http://www.leeslandscapes.com</a>).</p>
<p>Otto’s <strong>five tips for Spring lawn maintenance include: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clean Up</strong> – Otto recommends homeowners take the necessary time to remove any debris from their existing landscape, including leaves, twigs, and dead foliage. Additionally, all ornamental grasses should be cut back four to six inches in preparation for new growth.</li>
<li><strong>Fertilize</strong> – Homeowners should be sure to purchase a fertilizer specifically for plant beds. One application per month beginning around May 15th will help keep plants healthy throughout the season. Most garden centers offer a wide variety of organic fertilizers, too.</li>
<li><strong>Mulch</strong> – Spring is the ideal time to address low spots of mulch throughout a landscape. Ideally, landscapes should include more than four inches of mulch to prevent weeds and retain moisture within the root zone.</li>
<li><strong>Weeds</strong> – To maintain a pristine lawn, homeowners should check the area for any weeds, and pull them out as needed. By spending only 10 to 15 minutes a few times per week in their gardens, homeowners can effectively keep weeds at bay.</li>
<li><strong>Plan New Arrivals</strong> – Although Minnesota weather can be unpredictable, by waiting until at least May 15th before planting trees, shrubs, and perennials, homeowners can ensure they will not have to worry about a hard freeze that could possible damage the new plants. Annuals in containers can be planted earlier if the container can easily be moved inside, or if the plant is a frost resistant annual, such as a pansy.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;At Lee’s Landscaping and Design, we are committed to providing the most effective lawn care solutions for all of our clients. By simply abiding by our five basic Spring maintenance tips, all Minneapolis homeowners should be able to enjoy healthy, vibrant yards throughout the season,&#8221; concludes Otto.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>1. Woodland Garden<br />
</strong></p>
<p>I am often asked by clients, what is the best way to address areas that have extensive tree growth? Many homes and cabins in Minnesota have these areas in the landscape where there is a grove of trees, deciduous or evergreen and not much else other than weeds and sticks. These areas are called woodlands and can often have an unkept look. Woodland areas generally have several obstacles to overcome when deciding to dress them up. One is that they generally do not receive vast amounts of sunlight due to the dense foliage of the trees. This limits the choice and scope of plant material you can use. Second, woodlands are generally located toward the back of the property. This provides a beautiful backdrop or nice view, but when looking up close it leads us to our third obstacle, the woodland often looks messy and unorganized.</p>
<p>There are several ways that one can dress up a woodland garden. You want to start by coming up with a plan on how to tackle the area. You can do this on your own or hire a professional. You want to figure out the size of the area you will tackle, what is there? What do you want to enhance? What do you want to hide? Decide on parameters for the project and then decide on a budget. The budget does not have to be huge, you could just decide that you want to spend a weekend clearing out some of the debris and then spend $100.00 on annuals to add some color. Or you could decide that you want to add some unique features like a patio or bubbling fountain, the choice is yours.</p>
<p>A perfect way to dress up a woodland area is with shade perennials. These plants are adapted to growing in conditions where they receive less than 4 hours of sun per day. Perennials are also a good choice because once they are planted they will come back every year. There are abundant choices of shade loving perennials including hostas, lungwort, and many fern varieties. You want to mix it up so that you will have interest all year long. Many shade perennials have beautiful foliage characteristics that when put in combinations will give a very pleasing visual effect. Another tip for your woodland garden is to use a mulch groundcover once you have the space cleared and the plants are in the ground. This will aid in keeping the space free of unwanted intruders like weeds and tree seeds. Make sure you have a good 4 inches of mulch put down and use cedar type mulch as it degrades more slowly and you will not have to top dress as often.</p>
<p>For those that want to really dress up a woodland area, it is the perfect place for a patio with a nice bubbling fountain or gas fireplace. These spaces are often shaded which means you can gather on the patio and get some much needed relief from the heat of Minnesota summers. Woodlands are also unique because they make you feel like you are in nature even if it’s just your backyard. You want to capitalize on that and create a space where you can escape to the great outdoors.</p>
<p>Anyway you go about it the possibilities are endless for woodland gardens. They no longer need to be areas in your landscape that you only look at from afar. They are unique spaces that when addressed can add more functional space to your outdoor living area.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sun Gardens</strong></p>
<p>We all have that area in our landscape that completely bakes in the Minnesota summer heat all day long. It is almost impossible to grow anything there and if it happens to be turf, it looks dead 2 months out of the year. Well no more brown grass and half dead plants, there are simple things you can incorporate to give a more pleasing effect to those high heat, full-sun areas. Again you want to start with a plan. Ask yourself some questions, how large is the area? Is it close to a water source? (meaning can a hose reach or is there irrigation) do you want to establish a bedline or do you want a more natural look?</p>
<p>Once you have established the goals of your project there are some simple things you can do to add interest to the area. One easy way is to incorporate drought tolerant perennials and shrubs. These plants are adapted to high heat and often do very well after established with little maintenance. Some of the best choices for perennials are black eyed susans, ornamental grasses, and sedum. These plants have unique flowering and foliage characteristics that when used in combination can add color and interest to the area. Drought tolerant shrubs are a good choice in combination with the perennials to add more visual attention to the space. Some good ones are barberry, spirea, and junipers.</p>
<p>Another simple idea is adding some boulders to the space. They provide a nice backdrop for the plants and you don’t have to worry about them baking in the sun. You can use small to medium boulders in odd number combinations for a more natural look. If the space is large you may want to use some large boulders for an outcropping effect. You can then fill in the spaces with perennials and shrubs to complete the look. You will want to mulch the area to cut back on weeds and evaporation. Use 4 inches of good cedar mulch. This will also help to retain moisture and keep the root zones cool while the plants are establishing. You want to make sure you water the plants several times a week for most of the first season while they establish roots.</p>
<p>Once established the sun garden will provide an appealing element to your outdoor space and will save you time and effort trying to maintain turf in a high heat area. The color and interest from the different flowers and foliage will enhance your outdoor space for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>3. Containers</strong></p>
<p>Container gardening is a great way to spruce up any space in your landscape. Containers are a wonderful idea for small spaces, decks, stairs, entry ways, and just about any other spot you want to add some interest and color. You can utilize container plantings on any budget and in every garden scenario. They work in sun, shade, heat, winter and you can even do water garden containers if you are nervous about having a full scale pond.</p>
<p>First things first you want to establish a plan. How many containers do you want? What size is the area they will be located? Is the space in sun, shade, or heat? You then want to focus on choosing different types of containers. Plastic containers come in all different shapes, sizes, and colors and are generally light enough to move around. Clay or terra cotta containers come in many shapes and sizes and also come in some unique colors and glazes that can add a focal point to a space. You want to have enough containers to provide an impact on the space or draw someone’s attention. Group the containers in 3’s and try to have the same color but maybe 3 different sizes or shapes. Be creative; try to use the containers as a focal point that will catch your eye. You want to make sure that the containers have a drainage hole in the bottom for excess water to drain out. Add good potting soil to fill the containers. Do not use plain topsoil as it does not have enough nutrients to feed the plants all summer. You will also want to choose a fertilizer and apply at least once a month in between waterings.</p>
<p>Next, decide on plant material, again the choices are endless. You can choose annuals that will give a splash of color all summer long, you can choose perennials that will provide color and interest all year long, or you can choose combinations of annuals, perennials, and winter plants that you can change as the seasons change. You want to choose plants that can grow in the space. For instance if the space you want the container to be is on your deck and there is a large shade tree overhead pick plants that are shade tolerant. If you choose to pick the plant material yourself go to a garden center and ask what they recommend for sun, shade, etc. If you choose a designer to help, discuss with them what you want to create for the area. For instance if you have a large bare deck and want to create some height maybe some large containers with tropical plants will provide some shade and movement.</p>
<p>For winter interest at an entry point you may want to choose spruce tips and dogwood branches for a focal point against the snow. The possibilities are endless with container gardening. Try several things to see what works and what doesn’t. Keep a log or journal to write the types of plants you chose from season to season so that you can combine them in the future. Once you start you will find that container gardening is really an easy and inexpensive way to add beauty to your outdoor spaces.</p>
