      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a title="100/365 New crockpots!" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/17913022@N00/3894452057/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2431/3894452057_0a49d0b73d_m.jpg" border="0" alt="100/365 New crockpots!" /></a>The most commonly found slow cooker in a home is the basic slow cooker. This is controlled by a dial that allows the user to choose from high, low, or warmer settings. The cooker must be manually turned off and on. The user can switch from high to low, or vise versa, during cooking. After cooking, the pot can be placed on warmer to retain the meal&#8217;s heat. The bowl is found in both removable and non-removable styles.</p>
<p>Programmable slow cookers are very much like the basic slow cooker in their cooking settings. However, this cooker can be programmed for specific cook times and heat levels. It will automatically turn on and off and change settings for you. These cookers may be a bit more costly but are more convenient and call for even less effort on behalf of the cook.</p>
<p>In a miniature version of the basic range is the mini slow cooker. These crock pots are not as big as the standard versions and are designed to cook smaller portion meals. They are perfect for cooking dips, small amounts of soup, and dishes for the single person. Most have all of the same features of larger styles.</p>
<p>In addition to choosing a manual or automatic type, these crock pots also come in a variety of sizes. Typically, the cookers range from 1.5 litres to 6.5 litres. It is important to choose a big enough cooker to accommodate all of your meal needs. A 3.5 litre cooker is a popular choice.</p>
<p>They can also be found in different shapes, mainly round and oval. Round cookers are taller while oval slow cookers are longer. Both shapes can be found in various sizes, styles, and colors. The best shape for cooking is all in the preference of the chef. Most also have glass knobbed lids.</p>
<p>It is best to choose a slow cooker with a removable bowl for easier cleaning. The bowl can be taken from the heating unit and washed in soap and water. This is extremely helpful when foods stick or sit for too long amounts of time.</p>
<p>Choosing the right slow cooker for your home can make all the difference in your cooking success. Basic cookers often are adequate for most purposes. However, many enjoy the automatic operation feature in their slow cooker. Once you have found the right cooker, you will find it fun and easy to use!</p>

<p><a title="019-365" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/13194817@N00/4289244604/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2703/4289244604_1b867d0bc4_m.jpg" border="0" alt="019-365" /></a>There are many reasons why a slow cooker, or crock pot as it is sometimes called should have a place in your home. They can be a wonderful addition to any kitchen, and can cook a variety of different meals and desserts, quickly and easily without much preparation, or time. There are a variety of styles and models to choose from as well, most have are well under fifty pounds, so they  are also budget-friendly.</p>
<p>For one thing, for busy people who don&#8217;t have a lot of time to cook, a slow cooker can provide their family with a hot meal. The nice thing about them is that you can fill the cooker with the ingredients you need, put the lid on, set the timer and away you go. The cooker turns on by itself at the required time, and you have a hot meal when you get home.</p>
<p>They provide much healthier food. Because the cooking process is slow, all the natural juices and nutrients are absorbed back into the food, instead of being cooked out with a lot of conventional methods. Because you are not using oil, you eat much less fat, which is healthy for your whole family. There is such a variety of different foods and meals that can be cooked in a slow cooker, that you can have not only a healthy meal, but a different one every day if you want.</p>
<p>Using a crock pot is convenient. Since you are using minimal cooking utensils, like pots, pans and fryers, you cut down on time you are in the kitchen. Since you are cutting down on the amount of things you need to cook with, this also makes clean up a snap. You don&#8217;t have to worry about hand washing a bunch of dishes, or wasting water by filling up the dishwasher every evening.</p>
<p>For people who don&#8217;t really know how to cook, this is a wonderful way to make great meals. There are many different recipes, and as long as you can follow simple instructions, add the right ingredients, the cooker does all the work for you, and you take the credit. No more burning meals, wasting food, or any of the frustrations that many people experience.</p>
<p>When choosing your slow cooker, there are some things to consider. Price of course is important, but there are also other factors. Find the right size to fit your family&#8217;s needs. There are crock pots that have stationary containers, and ones that can be removed for cleaning, so you really need to decide which one is the best for your needs.</p>
<p>There are several different brands of slow cookers available. The only one who can say which one works the best is you. Some of the top slow cooker brands available are <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.ovalslowcookers.co.uk/category/morphy-richards-slow-cookers/" target=" " title="Morphy Richards Slow Cookers">Morphy Richards Slow Cookers</a>, <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.ovalslowcookers.co.uk/category/cuisinart-slow-cookers/" target=" " title="Cuisinart Slow Cookers">Cuisinart Slow Cookers</a>, and <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.ovalslowcookers.co.uk/category/rival-slow-cookers/" target=" " title="Rival Slow Cookers">Rival Slow Cookers</a>. It is a good idea to look at these brands first, but the choice really depends on you.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to go online and look at slow cooker review sites first. You want to compare prices, features and convenience. You also want to find one with the best warranty available whenever possible.</p>

Here is the second part of our slow cooker ingredients series, The Slow Cooker Store Cupboard. </p>
<p><strong>Corn starch or flour</strong> – These ingredients are handy for thickening and and for using when sautéing meat before adding to the slow cooker. If you apply a light coating of flour to meat and then sauté the meat in a small amount of olive oil, this will create some little bits of fully flavored &#8220;sticky bits&#8221; which you can then add to your slow cooker. Adding cornstarch to the liquid left in the slow cooker can make tasty gravy for dishes like potatoes or rice. You can also use flour as a thickener, but cornstarch makes lump-free gravy.</p>
<p><strong>Stock</strong> – You always need liquid to start the cooking process in a slow cooker. But instead of just using water as usual, try using stock instead. Beef, chicken, and vegetable stock can be bought as cubes, liquid or powder in most supermarkets. Or you can check out my <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.ovalslowcookers.co.uk/best-slow-cooker-recipes/slow-cooking-making-the-perfect-chicken-stock/" target=" " title="chicken stock recipe">chicken stock recipe</a> for the slow cooker. Most shop-bought stock also comes seasoned already and it’s a simple way to add some flavour to your slow cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Meat </strong>– Although this article is about what&#8217;s in your storecupboard, meat is often the largest part of a (non-veggie) slow cooker meal, so make sure you have some of your favourite cuts in the home freezer. Don&#8217;t forget that tough cuts of meat will cook great and end up almost melingt in your mouth when fully cooked. This is because slow cooking adds moisture and tenderises meat that would dry out and be tough and stringy if oven cooked instead.</p>
<p>If you have these ingredients in your kitchen, you can make loads of simple slow cooker meals. If you make sure you have them always in, you’ll always have lots of ideas for dinner.</p>

<p>Before I had a slow cooker, making stock was a drawn out process involving lots of boiling on the stove &#8211; it used to take all day!</p>
<p>Now, my chicken stock takes just a couple of easy steps and tastes even more delicious.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how I do it:</p>
<p><strong>Chicken: </strong>I use the chicken carcass left over from our roast chicken dinner. After picking off any meat to be used for sandwiches the next day, I simply place the chicken into my <a class="ld_link" href="http://www.ovalslowcookers.co.uk/category/oval-slow-cookers/" target=" " title="oval slow cooker">oval slow cooker</a> (if you have a circular one you may need to squish it in a little, but that doesn&#8217;t affect the stock making process).</p>
<p><strong>Liquid:</strong> I then add water to the slow cooker til it just covers the carcass. If I have any left over gravy or vegetable cooking water then I&#8217;d add that in too.</p>
<p><strong>Vegetables:</strong> Throw in a roughly chopped onion (if you include a bit of browned skin this will give the stock a nice golden glow). Also good to add are a chopped carrot and a celery stick (you can include the leaves).</p>
<p><strong>Herbs and spices</strong>: You can add your herbs and spices according to taste. I like to add whole black peppercorns, a peeled garlic clove, a couple of bay leaves and any fresh &#8220;woody herbs&#8221; such as rosemary and thyme (you can add the stalks).</p>
<p><strong>Cooking Procedure: </strong>Simply cover the slow cooker and leave on the low setting overnight. Drain the stock the next morning and place in pan and reduce it down until it thickens slightly. Leave to cool then freeze until your recipes need some homemade chicken stock.</p>

<p><strong>Using Liquid in the Slow Cooker</strong></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to include some liquid in your slow cooker. You need to include some liquid in your slow cooker to start off the process of slow cooking. You don&#8217;t need to put loads in but if you don&#8217;t add some liquid, your meal will stick to the bottom of the dish and burn. An added bonus is that if you are cooking meat, any meat juices will mix with this liquid and form a fabulous gravy or stock.</p>
<p><strong>Slow Cooker Temperatures </strong></p>
<p>A slow cooker needs to be at least half full for optimum cooking. Remember that the more you add to the slow cooker, the longer time it will take to cook. The heat settings will cook your food evenly without overcooking if the temperature is adjusted accordingly. If you aren’t careful and don’t adjust the slow cooker heat settings, you might discover that an eight hour setting cooked your meal in two and spent the other six hours drying it out!</p>
<p><strong>Slow Cooking Meat</strong></p>
<p>Meat is the most popular food cooked in a slow cooker. People also use a slow cooker to usually cook main dinner dishes as this is the meal you can struggle with the most when you are trying to prepare something to eat for the evening on a busy schedule. Remember, the meat you are using needs to be thoroughly drained before adding it to the slow cooker. As meat takes longer to cook, they need to placed on the bottom layer inside the slow cooker. This will also help to keep the meat moist since it will cook gently into the liquid underneath it.</p>
<p>For food safety reasons, meat needs to be cooked for at least three hours so that iy reaches an internal temperature that is high enough to cook the meat properly and safely. This isn&#8217;t usually a problem since most cooks use the slow cooker at its lowest setting (six to ten hours depending on the slow cooker brand). <br /><strong><br />Slow Cooking Vegetables</strong></p>
<p>If you are planning to cook vegetables in your slow cooker, here are some points to remember. Tough fibrous veggies like potatoes, turnips and carrots can be tossed in at the start with the meat. It takes longer for the fibres to be broken down and the vegetables to be cooked all the way through. More delicate vegetables like tomatoes, peppers, and mushrooms should be added 30 minutes before the cooking finish time has been reached.</p>

<p>Your slow cooker will pay for itself in no time at all. The time you save when you are making a meal makes it priceless. But, if you intend to make slow cooking part of your regular meal times, then it pays to have a few staples to keep in your cupboards to make meal planning easy.</p>
<p>Beans – Beans are a very economical source of protein that cook very well in a slow cooker. Each bean has its own flavour which can be enhanced by the herbs or spices you use to cook them. Beans can make a meal base when you cook them with meat or  be the main ingredient if you are a vegetarian looking to create a quick and simple dish. Whether haricot, lentil, borlotti, or black-eyed, beans can create some fantastic slow cooker meals.</p>
<p><strong>Fibrous Vegetables</strong> – For starters, these means good old spuds and the average kitchen has at least a few potatoes lurking around in the vegetable rack.  They are a really versatile food. Mash them, stew them, fry them, or chuck them in the slow cooker. Potatoes add density to stews, soups, and meat-free meals. Potatoes and other fibrous veggies like carrots, swede and turnips, take a while to cook,so they can be thrown in the slow cooker with meat and can cook all day.</p>
<p><strong>Fresh Herbs</strong> – Using herbs can dramatically change the flavour of almost any meal you make. Herbs can be bought dried, but they release a much better flavour if they are added fresh. You can even grow your own fresh herbs in the house in small pots on your kitchen window sill. All you need is a nice sunny spot, some compost, and remember to water them regularly. Home grown herbs can even be dried to extend their life, making them easy to keep around without worrying too much about wasting them. Remeber to add your herbs are added near the end of the slow cooker cooking cycle so their flavour infiltrates the cooked meal and isn&#8217;t lost during the cooking time.</p>

I&#8217;ve placed some of my hottest tips below to help you make the right decision.</p>
<p><strong>What Size Slow Cooker Do I Need?</strong></p>
<p>Slow cookers can be bought in various sizes, but usually fit into three groups.</p>
<p>Mini slow cookers are around 1.5 litres and are best for the single cook or a couple who want to use a slow cooker for a single meal.</p>
<p>Medium sized slow cookers can hold 3.5 litres but have a usual cooking capacity of about 2.5 litres. They&#8217;re great for slow cooking meals for 2-4 people.</p>
<p>Large slow cookers have a capacity of 6 litres which works out as about 4.5 litres in the pot. Ideal for large groups or for batch cooking, for example, bulk cooking stews and casseroles to divide and freeze.</p>
<p>The difference in size and actual cooking capacity happens because you need to have some spare space in a slow cooker in order for the food to cook properly.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Clean My Slow Cooker?</strong></p>
<p>Slow cookers include inner ceramic pots which can be removed to allow you to serve your slow cooking straight from the slow cooker to the dinner table. This removable dish lets your guests or family sit and relax at the table as they serve their food straight onto the plate instead of you standing over the stove to dish up. Many inner pots are non-stick and most can be placed straight into a dishwasher making cleaning up at the end of your meal as easy as making it in the first place</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Work Out The Temperature I Need?</strong></p>
<p>Temperature settings vary amongst different types of slow cookers. Most have a range of temperature settings to meet the needs of various recipes. Some have just a couple of settings (low and high) and others include five settings that vary from high (two hours) to really slow cooking (ten hours or more). Some even have a warm setting in case your dish has finished cooking but the accompanying side dishes still need to be prepared or finish cooking. This setting is also very useful for those occasions when everyone isn’t ready to eat their meal just yet.</p>
