      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->So, you are getting an error message while trying to boot your Windows Operating System (OS) based computer? Or some error message is restricting your PC from booting? Well, this behavior occurs when Master Boot Record (MBR) or its related components are corrupt! MBR is the first sector of hard disk that consists of all key information responsible for successful booting of your computer. MBR starts the boot process by looking at the partition table (stored in MBR itself) to determine the bootable partition (or primary/active partition) and then tries to boot from it. Hence, your system does not boot as well as starts throwing various error messages, if any of these components: MBR, partition table, or bootable partition is corrupt. In such situation opting for reliable third-party <strong><a href="http://www.stellarinfo.com">data recovery software</a> </strong>can drag you out of the devastating situation of data loss.</p>
<p>Let us see some common error messages which restrict our Windows operating system based computer from successful booting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Error: </strong><em><strong>Non-System Disk or Disk Error/ Missing 	Operating System:</strong></em><em> </em>We encounter this error message 	when none of the system files which are needed to load the operating 	system are found though there is active partition present in the 	system. This issue also occurs when a non-system partition is marked 	as active by FDISK or the entry of the system partition is removed 	from the partition table.</li>
<li><strong>Error:</strong> <em><strong>NTLDR is missing / Disk Read Error</strong></em><strong>: </strong>problem again is caused when the system files needed for the 	loading of operating system are missing. In such situation, the MBR 	successfully finds the boot sector and active partition in the 	partition table but due to the unavailability of system files, we 	encounter this issue.</li>
<li><strong>Error:</strong> <em><strong>Operating System not found:</strong></em><strong> </strong>error 	message is encountered when MBR does not find any active partition 	or MBR does not find boot sector on active partition. In such 	situation MBR fails to pass the control and thus the booting process 	halts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though there are measures provided by Microsoft to rectify these error messages but at times these recommended measures too fail to do needful. In such situation formatting of the operating system remains the only way to work around the issue. Since, formatting deletes entire data saved on the primary partition and hence to recover the formatted data you can either use updated backup or  data recovery. These data recovery tools recover lost, deleted, formatted, or inaccessible data from Windows OS based computers.</p>
<p>One of the awards winning and highly recommended software for this category is Stellar Phoenix Windows Data Recovery<strong> </strong>. The software recovers lost/deleted/formatted data from Windows based hard disk drives and other storage media. The software is compatible with Windows 7, Vista, Server2003, XP, 2000, and NT4 (SP6).</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->Everyone loves to cherish the golden moments of their lives and in this regard photos play an important role. Today with the inception of digital camera, it has become quite easy to click photos anytime anywhere but with this advancement in the photo technology, preserving a photo is still a matter of concern. However, after the advent of <strong><a href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/digital-media-recovery.htm">photo recovery</a> </strong>software, deleted or lost digital photos are thing of the past. These specialized photo recovery tools use intense algorithms to scan the storage space like memory card, hard disk, etc to recover the photos.</p>
<p>But, before anything else, we must first understand the reasons which lead to digital photo loss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accidental deletion of photos</li>
<li>Pulling out the memory card while the digital camera is on</li>
<li>Intentional or unintentional formatting of storage device like 	memory card or hard disk of computer</li>
<li>Damage or corruption in the file system of storage device</li>
<li>Rapid clicking of photos which prevents completion of write process</li>
<li>Switching off the digital camera soon after clicking a photograph 	also interrupts the photo write process and thus, leads to photo 	loss</li>
<li>Ignoring the warnings like low battery and memory card full may also 	corrupt the memory card and thus create the situation of photo loss</li>
<li>Erroneous or interrupted read/write process</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above mentioned situations lead to the situation of photo loss. To prevent the loss, it is always recommended to maintain the backup. It is advised to save all your precious photos and videos at multiple locations. However, despite of various precautions measures observed by a user to prevent his/her photos from getting lost there happens some time when user loses his/her precious photos. But, situations of photo loss too can easily be handled through efficient third-party photo recovery software.</p>
<p>Efficient photo recovery software has simple user interface and easy photo recovery steps. All you need to do is to attach the memory card or other affected storage media to your computer, scan the media with the photo recovery software, see the preview of the recoverable photos, and in the end save the recovered photos at your desired location. But, in case you are facing the issue due to memory card corruption then you need to format the card to bring it back to the working condition and then use the above mentioned mechanism to recover the photos.</p>
<p>One of the highly recommended <strong><a href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/digital-media-recovery.htm">photo recovery software</a> </strong>is Stellar Phoenix Photo Recovery. This powerful photo recovery software recovers photos in 3-simple steps, has very intuitive user interface, and is available for Mac and Windows users separately.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; }a:link {  } --><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Windows is the mostly used operating system in the world. Around 90% of computer users use Windows operating system as the primary OS in their computers, where as Mac, LINUX and others are able to hold less than 10%. Windows is popular among its users for its advanced features and user-friendly graphical user interfaces. In true sense, the operating system has been designed, keeping the knowledge level of a non-technical computer user and thus even a novice can use it, without much assistance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">But, as this simplicity attracts more users, at the same time Windows based systems suffer from data loss problems the most. However, you need not be worried working on it, as there are many efficient Windows recovery software available to retrieve all your lost, deleted or inaccessible data back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">While working on your PC, accidental deletion, formatting of the hard drive partition is not that uncommon. Everyday, many Windows users lose their valuable data to such problems and think that they can never be able to recover the deleted data again. But, gone are the days, when once you deleted a file could never be retrieved. Now there are many data recovery utilities available, using which you can recover all your deleted or even formatted data back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">In case of deletion, Windows OS has only removed the entries of the deleted files from the system hard drive. Hence, the files still present in the memory and they will remain in the hard drive memory, until some other files overwrite them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Thus, if the removed or deleted entries of files can be read, those files can be easily restored in their source locations. <a href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/windows-data-recovery.php">Windows data recovery</a> software are designed with highly advanced algorithms, which able to find out the lost entries of files and successfully recover them back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">These utilities are also able to recover data from various other data loss instances, such as file system corruption, Windows OS malfunction, virus/malware infection etc. In spite of being powerful, these Windows recovery utilities are completely read-only in their recovery operations and recover lost/inaccessible data, without even modifying their original structure. Moreover, these recovery utilities are designed with simple as well as interactive graphical user interfaces and can be used by any category of Windows users, from experts to the non-technical ones. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->The &#8216;Windows Update&#8217; feature helps you download and install the latest Microsoft updates for your version of Windows operating system. You can turn on the automatic updation and the wizard will show you the update status. While installing updates, you may occasionally encounter that your system hangs and the process cannot be completed. This could happen as a result of virus infection, corrupt file system, hardware problems, etc. In the worst cases, it may cause serious data loss and render all your precious files on the hard drive inaccessible. To overcome this problem, you need to go for <strong><strong>hard drive recovery</strong></strong> through a reliable third-party utility.</p>
<p>When you try installing some critical updates on your Windows Vista based computer, the process stops unexpectedly and leaves the following error message on your screen:</p>
<p>“<em><a href="http://datarecoverymethods.blogspot.in/2010/12/recovering-inaccessible-windows-xp-data.html">Boot critical file C:\ntoskrnl.exe is corrupt</a>”</em></p>
<p>This would render your system unbootable and put you in a jeopardous situation of data loss.</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This problem is faced when the &#8216;Ntoskrnl.exe&#8217; file becomes corrupt due to incomplete updates.</p>
<p>This would make all your hard drive data inaccessible. At this stage, you may use an updated backup to restore all the lost or inaccessible data. However, if the backup is missing, you should follow the below mentioned resolution steps.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>To resolve the above issue, follow the given procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot your computer using the 	Windows Vista installation disc and start the Windows Recovery 	environment.</li>
<li>At the command prompt, execute the 	given command:</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8216;<em>sfc /scannow</em>&#8216;</p>
<p>This would start the System File Checker that repairs Vista system files.</p>
<p>If the problem still persists, you should format your hard drive and perform a clean installation of Windows Vista. Formating would erase all your precious data stored on the drive. In such circumstances, you should take help of professional <a href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/download.htm"><strong>hard drive data recovery</strong></a> software.</p>
<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->These third-party tools safely recover every piece of inaccessible information from corrupt Windows-based drives and other storage media.

Well, for the users who do not have proper backup, there are bunch of file recovery<strong> </strong>software to recover valuable files or data. However, I too was quite unaware of the fact that recovery of formatted files is possible through third-party recovery software before I encountered the situation.</p>
<p>Let me explain you my case in detail.</p>
<p>For the past few days I was very much perturbed with the sluggish performance of my Windows XP based laptop. Scanned all the drives and even entire system for three times with the latest anti-virus but the problem persisted. However, the situation became jittery when my laptop denied restarting after running virus scan for the fourth time. Worried, restarted it for many times but with no luck. However, without losing hope inserted Windows XP installation disk to repair system from Recovery Console but didn’t find any solution. That situation left me nothing but to format the hard disk of my laptop and reinstall Windows XP OS.</p>
<p>Although I was having the backup of almost all of the data on external hard disk but there were some really very crucial doc files present on the My Document which were not backed up. Losing those files would be a big loss as they were containing my latest work which I had not submitted to my boss. However, at that time the immediate importance was formatting the hard disk. Thus, I formatted my laptop and then put the issue of losing files due to formatting in front of IT Support of my office. A member from IT Support team came and took my laptop with him and after few hours called me to their room.</p>
<p>I was shocked to see all the formatted files on the interface of some file recovery software. This was something very strange which I could believe as I was not at all aware of the fact that recovery of formatted files or data is possible. However, then I pointed out few of the formatted files of which I didn’t backed up and in few minutes the software recovered all the required ones. Thus, after successfully recovering all my files I asked that person from IT Support about that file recovery software.</p>
<p>He told me that he used <a href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/file-recovery.htm"><strong>Stellar Phoenix File Recovery</strong></a> software<strong> </strong>to recover all the formatted files. Further, he told me that Stellar Phoenix File Recovery software is one of the finest file recovery tools which uses high-end scanning algorithms for recovery of lost, formatted, or deleted files. The software has different versions for Mac and Windows users and supports recovery of 185 file types including emails, photos, videos, text documents, etc. Thus, to protect my data from future mishaps, I downloaded this efficient tool. <strong> </strong></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.21cm; } -->A hard disk can be divided into logically separated storage units called as partitions. Every partition is formatted according to a file system. The file system decides the method of organizing and storing the data into the partition. Different operating systems use different file systems, such as Windows operating system uses NTFS, FAT, or exFat file system. Therefore, if the partition or partition file system suffers from some corruption or malfunction then chances of data inaccessibility or data loss saved on that partition are created.</p>
<p>However, there are measures available online to fix the problems related to partition corruption. But, sometimes these solution measures too fail to rectify the issue and thus the problem itself compels the user to reformat the partition. Though, reformatting deletes all the data from the hard drive partition but the data can easily be recovered form updated backup. In the absence of backup, third-party <strong>partition recovery </strong>software can do the needful.</p>
<p>Let us discuss this issue through practical example. Consider, when you try to start your Microsoft Windows XP based computer (which has NTFS partition), encountered the following error message:</p>
<p>“<em>Windows could not start because of an error in the software. Please report this problem as: load needed DLLs for kernel. Please contact your support person to report this problem.”</em></p>
<p>After encountering this error message, you may become unable to boot your system. However, to solve this issue, you must understand the causes behind occurrence of this error message.</p>
<p><strong>Cause:</strong></p>
<p>This issue occurs when the Hal.dll and Ntoskrnl.exe files are mismatched.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
<p>To solve this problem start your computer with Windows XP installation CD then follow the below mentioned steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to setup page and repair the Windows installation by selecting 	‘R’.</li>
<li>Now at the recovery console, run CHKDSK, to fix the errors on your 	disk.</li>
<li>Try to run BOOTCFG/rebuilt, to rebuild the boot configuration. 	Provide all the information which are asked and press Enter.</li>
<li>Then try to run FIXBOOT , to fix the current boot sector.</li>
<li>In the end try to run FIXMBR to fix the issues related to Master 	Boot Record of your system.</li>
<li>Now, go out of the recovery console by selecting Exit and restart 	your computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the times the above recommended resolution steps can solve the issue and fix the error. But, there are times when these solutions fail to workaround the situation at that time you are left with single choice that is to format your Windows XP based hard drive and restore the data from updated backup. However, in the absence of an updated backup, one is left with a choice that is to use third-party <strong>partition recovery software </strong>to recover precious data. These software can recover your data lost due to formatting or deletion of partitions.</p>
<p>One such software is Stellar Phoenix Partition Recovery Software. This efficient partition recovery software for Windows operating system based computers recover lost, deleted, or inaccessible partitions. The software has intuitive user-interface which does not require knowledge of data recovery or prior training of the software. This efficient software supports the data recovery from FAT and NTFS file systems and is compatible with Windows 7, Vista, XP, 2003, and 2000.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"> From the very first time I worked on Mac, I was completely blown by its incompatible user interface and easy to use features. With its beautiful menu items and smooth typing, Mac also provides powerful video, audio, and picture editing feature which make it the first choice of graphic designers, professional photographers, and multimedia industry. And thus, all these unparalleled features of Mac compelled me to switch to it and I can never regret my decision. Therefore, since then I edit all my photos and videos on my Mac machine without any difficulty. But, one particular day while cleaning my Mac, I accidentally deleted a folder which contains some of very precious image files. The moment, I realized my blunder; I went into the state of shock! I could not afford to lose those photos as they were of one of my very urgent clients. However, immediately I started looking for some good <strong><a title="mac photo recovery" href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/mac-photo-recovery.htm">Mac photo recovery</a> </strong>option.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my search, I found that there are a number of third-party Mac photo recovery tools available. Some of these software have very simple user-interface which does not any technical knowledge or prior training of the software. Further, in my search I found that some of the software not only support recovery from Mac machine but also support recovery from almost all kinds of Mac supported storage media such as <strong>external hard drive, memory card, USB drives, iPods</strong>, etc. Thus, after short listing three of Mac photo recovery software among a list of many, I downloaded free demo versions of them and started comparing. In my comparison, I found that two of them support only some major cameras and memory card brands but not all of them as well as they do not support almost all photo, video, as well as other multimedia file formats.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this way, after doing a thorough comparative analysis, I found that Stellar Phoenix Mac Photo Recovery is one of the best <strong>photo recovery </strong>software for <strong>Mac. </strong>The software not only supports almost all camera brands but also supports a good number of memory card types including <strong>SD card, MMC card, XD card, Micro SD card, Mini SD card</strong>, etc. The user interface of the software has read-only nature and is very easy to understand even by a person with zero technical knowledge. With the guarantee of recovering almost all kinds of photos the efficient software also supports recovery of various other multimedia files including audio files, video files, music files, etc. Thus, I am very much thankful to the developers and <strong>24X5 customer support</strong> of this software for saving my life by providing the full recovery of my accidentally deleted photos!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The excellent and eminent photo editing and designing features of Mac make it a first choice for professional photographers and graphic designers. These features are so simple and easy to use that even a layman can use them flawlessly. So, we can say that due to its excellent graphic features, it is always a wonderful experience to view and edit photos and videos on Mac. However, despite being most robust Operating System, we sometimes end up losing our precious photos or videos saved on Mac due to various reasons like file system corruption, application malfunctioning, or accidental deletion. But, in this modern era of computers and software it is possible to recover our lost or deleted digital photos through third-party <strong><a title="Mac photo recovery" href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/mac-photo-recovery.htm" target="_blank">Mac photo recovery software</a></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Let us discuss the major reasons which are responsible for loss of pictures/videos saved on Mac:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Corruption in the partition table leads to inaccessibility of our valuable data/photos/videos stored on Mac.</li>
<li>The Mac becomes inaccessible due to file system corruption and thus, we end up losing our valuable photos/videos.</li>
<li>Damaged or corrupt catalog tree also crates inaccessibility to our valuable files/folders which contain our valuable photos/videos.</li>
<li>At times due to various human errors like accidental deletion or unwanted formatting of Mac based storage media (internal/external hard drive, iPod, memory card, etc) we end up losing our pictures.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, the<strong> ‘Disk utility’ (an inbuilt utility) of Mac</strong> can rectify some of the above mentioned issues but if the problem is severe and disk utility fails to workaround the situation then commercial Mac photo recovery software works as a boon. These software can recover lost or deleted photos and videos without altering their original content. But, it is advised to do a proper research before using any third-party photo recovery software; as some of the freeware available under this category are malware or spyware which can damage our Mac despite of recovering photos.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is recommended to go for the one which has pretty good experience in the field of data recovery, has simple yet effective GUI, and last but not the least provides glimpse of deleted or lost photos/videos before their actual recovery. One such software is Stellar Phoenix Mac Photo Recovery software. This is one of the most efficient photo recovery software for Mac which has simple user-interface and easy recovery steps which make it very easily usable even by non professional users. In addition the software supports recovery from almost all Mac based storage media like <strong>internal/external hard drive, USB drive, iPod, pen drive, digital camera</strong>, etc. The powerful recovery software not only recovers lost or deleted pictures from Mac based storage devices but also recovers videos, audios, and various other multimedia files saved on them.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><!-- p { margin-bottom: 0.08in; } -->Working on computer means easy, fast and safe storage of data. It is advised to backup the data regularly. This keeps you well prepared for any loss of data. However, there are many ways by which the data can be lost. In many cases the backup taken is not complete and in case the storage media is damaged you lose your precious data and need <strong><a title="data recovery tools" href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/">data recovery software</a> </strong>to get them back.</p>
<p lang="en-US">
<p lang="en-US">Some of the common reasons of data loss are -</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-US">Intentional or 	unintentional deletion of data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-US">Formatting of the 	storage media</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-US">Physical or logical 	damage to the storage media(these are the two categories of data 	loss)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter what be the cause, data loss is always terrible. You cannot do away with your invaluable data and <strong>data recovery </strong>in such a case becomes very important. Often the data are recovered from storage media, such as hard drives, CDs and DVDs. Unfortunately if you lose data, you try various methods to recover it. Many of these processes can be learned from the Internet.</p>
<p>Some methods that you may try recovering the data are-</p>
<ol>
<li>Look in the Recycle Bin. If your 	file is there, right click on it and select &#8216;<strong>Restore&#8217;</strong> to  get 	the file back to the previous location.</li>
<li>You may use the &#8216;System 	Restore&#8217; option depending up on the date when you lost the data.</li>
<li>You 	may also use the<strong> &#8216;</strong>Emergency 	Boot Disk&#8217; to recover the data once the  Windows</li>
</ol>
<p>starts.</p>
<p>In cases where there has been logical damage to the hard disk, such as, file system corruption, a good portion of the original data can be recovered using specialized <a title="data recovery" href="http://www.stellarinfo.com/"><strong>data recovery tools</strong></a>. This type of <strong>recovery</strong> can be performed by end-users as it requires no special training.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Diagnostics and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Recovery Toolset can verify and repair any possible OS level corruption or damage. </strong>It also lets you fix a corrupt, unbootable Windows XP or Windows Vista installation. However, serious cases still require expert&#8217;s consultation and precisely designed <strong>data recovery software</strong>. These software are specifically designed to help your <strong>recovery </strong>purpose<strong>. </strong>They recover up to 100% of the lost data. The good thing is that they are very user friendly and economical. Available everywhere, they are efficient enough to recover data and files of any format.</p>
