Cotton is the world&#8217;s most popular fabric. Soft and comfortable, it&#8217;s used for almost every type of clothing. Organically raised cotton is gradually winning over new ground in the marketplace. No toxins or synthetic fertilizers are used. <span style="font-weight: normal;">Organic cotton </span>is produced without the use of harsh chemical bleaches or dyes, and is allergy free. New methods of coloring cotton are also being developed to address the problem of toxic dyes- organically colored cotton. Earth tones are now available which use no dyes whatsoever.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spiffybaby.com/Organic-Cotton-Clothing-p-1-c-186.html"></a>Bamboo fiber has been publicized as THE natural, green,&lt;!&#8211;adsense#postad&#8211;&gt; renewable and eco-friendly textile of the 21st Century. Bamboo thrives naturally without the use of pesticides, and is 100% biodegradable in soil by micro-organism and sunshine, causing no pollution to the environment. Bamboo naturally exhibits these characteristics: anti-bacterial; anti-fungal; anti-static; natural antibiosis qualities keep bacterium in check, decreasing bad odors; micro-gaps in the bamboo fiber give a <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">moisture</span> <span style="font-weight: normal;">absorption</span></span> rate 3X that of regular cotton; ultra-plush texture is soft on sensitive skin.<br />
Organic and bamboo cotton clothing is now available for babies and parents at SpiffyBaby.com from premier brands and designers. Hard to find organic cotton items, such as organic denim, and even organic socks, are easily available in our online boutique.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>With young children, you’ll want to find as many ways to include the entire family in preparing for and celebrating Christmas. The trick can be finding ways to include young ones in a safe and non-exasperating way!</em></p>
<p><strong>Decorate the Tree Together</strong><br />
Give up your particular ways and leave the glass ornaments in storage. Buy bright, plastic or fabric ornaments and let your children help decorate the tree. You can always move the large number of low hanging ornaments up higher after little ones have gone to bed, and your tree might not win any decorating contests, but it will be the source of many memories – be sure to take pictures. </p>
<p><strong>Decorate Christmas Cookies</strong><br />
Children closer to their preschool years can help roll and cut cookies out, but older babies and young toddlers can help decorate the cookies as well. Make a batch of Christmas sugar cookies. When they are cool, spread a thin layer of icing on the cookies and let your little ones enjoy playing with sprinkles, chocolate candies and other goodies as they make the cookies look creative and lovely in their own way.</p>
<p><strong>Buy Gifts</strong><br />
Children are easily taken in by the thought of receiving gifts at Christmas time, so you should make a conscious effort from very early on to show your child how much fun it is to buy gifts for others. Young children do have trouble keeping a secret, however, so you would do well to buy the gifts immediately before the big event.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The Festival of Lights might technically be a relatively minor holiday for the Jewish faith, but it is certainly fun to celebrate as a family during the holiday season. If part of your Hanukkah tradition is giving gifts to your young children, finding eight gifts for eights days of celebration might be tricky, but then again, with a bit of help, this Hanukkah gift giving year might be easier than ever.</em></p>
<p><strong>Day One</strong><br />
Wooden Toys and Puzzles – Wooden toys and particularly puzzles are a wonderful way to engage your child’s mind and have a good time simultaneously. </p>
<p><strong>Day Two</strong><br />
A New Book – A special hard cover book or a few paperbacks to enjoy together will be a fun way to enjoy the cold weather and fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>Day Three</strong><br />
New Clothes – Everyone gets some new clothes for holiday gifts, it’s just part of being a kid.</p>
<p><strong>Day Four</strong><br />
Blocks – Stacking, building and playing pretend start young and as your child grows, you can add to her block collection by buying new sizes and different styles.</p>
<p><strong>Day Five</strong><br />
Dolls and Action Figures – Again, allowing your child to use her imagination is critical to her development. Dolls, cars, trains and action figures are a great way to do just that.</p>
<p><strong>Day Six</strong><br />
New Outdoor Items – The snow or cold weather is the perfect time for new snow boots, rain slickers, fun umbrellas, jackets, and rain boots. </p>
<p><strong>Day Seven</strong><br />
New Movies – A few new DVDs to watch as a family make a nice, warm gift for any child.</p>
<p><strong>Day Eight</strong><br />
The Big Present – Every child deserves something big and fun, and price isn’t necessary an issue as you can find many things on sale or buy second-hand. From swing sets to tricycles, the last night of Hanukkah is a great time to unveil your little one’s best gift.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Thanksgiving is a time for families to come together and that shouldn’t exclude your baby. Whether he is just sampling table foods or is a full-fledged finger-food eater, your child can be very much a part of the family Thanksgiving dinner if you plan ahead:<br />
</em><br />
<strong>Plain Mashed Potatoes</strong> – Regular or sweet potatoes are naturals for babies eating finger foods or being spoon fed. Lumpy mashed potatoes are great for little fingers and if you mash the potatoes to a lumpy state, you can scoop some out and mash the rest to a finer quality if you like. Spoon fed babies probably prefer the finer mashed varieties. Avoid gravies for your little one as they are heavy and often contain a great deal of fat and other items your child doesn’t need.</p>
<p><strong>Macaroni and Cheese</strong> – It might not be a Thanksgiving tradition (yet) around your house, but if you prepare macaroni and cheese from scratch for the table, your toddler will likely be very grateful. You would be hard-pressed to find a child or adult who didn’t love mac and cheese, even if it’s served on china plates.</p>
<p><strong>Beans</strong> – When preparing your green bean casserole or a pot of lima beans, put some aside to keep them clean and unseasoned. Most children can handle and enjoy sauces and seasonings as they get older, but young toddlers and picky preschoolers would probably enjoy a variety that was closer to what they enjoy every day.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>If you are like most parents, you have a huge collection of baby pictures, toddler pictures and then school pictures of your children. What is most often missing from the collection is a picture of the family as a whole. Family portraits can be hard to arrange as we have so many different commitments pulling on our schedules, but taking pictures together as a family on a regular basis can be one of the most powerful mementos you have of your growing family. </em></p>
<p><strong>Book a Photographer</strong><br />
If you wait for the ideal time, it’s likely you’ll never find it. Instead, simply book a photographer to come out to your home on a certain day or make an appointment at a photo studio. Treat this as any of your other commitments and leave yourself plenty of time to get ready. </p>
<p><strong>Look Your Best</strong><br />
It can be hard for new parents to look their best. All attention is riveted on the youngest members of the family and moms especially tend to get by without a lot of personal attention. Hair and nails are no longer priorities and a wash-and-wear wardrobe becomes essential. Step away from that life for a day and find yourself something flattering and nice to wear. Have your hair and nails done and spend an extra three minutes on your make-up. You never know when you’ll have another chance to make your family look this good</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>As babies grow older and become a bit more self-sufficient in their play, it’s easy to let household chores and other small details about the house prevent you from actually sitting and playing with your child. Often, the games and toys of a young toddler aren’t particularity exciting to adults, so it’s with some relief you work around your child while he plays.</em></p>
<p>While this is normal and even healthy for children to learn to play independently, it’s also important to stop what you’re doing and give your child your undivided attention for long stretches of time. If sitting around the house playing his games gets a bit tedious, break up your time together by sitting down to play computer games together or taking a walk outside to check on what nature has to offer.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter what you do together so long as your child has an opportunity to have your undivided attention for a spell. Let him pick the activities or at least give his permission before changing from one game to another. This way, he knows that he is still your number one and you can end every evening without worry or fear that you didn’t do enough to make him feel special that day.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The bond between a father and son is very special indeed. Even stepping outside the clichés of throwing the baseball or football in the backyard, the bond between generations of males is one to be developed and strengthened. How you do this in your family is more closely related to your background, culture and hobbies than anything the media might portray.</em></p>
<p><strong>Be His First Teacher</strong><br />
As the father of a boy, you are his first teacher. For the first years of his life, your son might have preferred his mother for cuddling and soothing, but when it’s time for play, he knew where to turn. Use that special, fun relationship as the basis for instruction. Teach him everything you know about everything, realizing that the lessons can’t be taught in a week, but over years together. It’s never too early to lay a foundation.</p>
<p><strong>Be His Leader</strong><br />
Boys are pack animals, and until the more volatile teenage years, you will be his primary role model – whether you want to be or not. Even as a teenager, he will always look to you for silent guidance in what you say and do. Act the way you want your son to act, and don’t bother trying to tell him to act any differently than you do. You’re his hero after all.</p>
