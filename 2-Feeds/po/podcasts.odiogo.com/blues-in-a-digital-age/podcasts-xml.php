<p>In the March issue of DOWNBEAT MAGAZINE, writer Eric Fine previews ‘Platinum’, the upcoming Owl Studios release by Jazz/funk/fusion legends THE HEADHUNTERS, lead by founding members and co-leaders Mike Clark and Bill Summers. Fine describes the June CD as the band’s “most ambitious album since the 1970s” &#8211;</p>
<p><span id="more-4996"></span><br />
‘Platinum’ features special appearances by Snoop Dogg, George Clinton, Killah Priest, Del the Funky Homosapien and others &#8212; the inclusion of guest vocalists/rappers is deftly incorporated into the soulful grooves laid down by the pioneering Headhunters. The concept behind the new album is fitting – as noted in a recent article: “Jazz/fusion groundbreakers the Headhunters have been sampled by countless hip-hop and pop artists. These days, the band is incorporating rap and hip-hop into its own sound.”</p>
<p>Renowned drummer Mike Clark previewed the project as “some of the finest musicians playing some killer funk, which is always a lot of fun. This time we stir it up with spoken word from a multi generational mix of artists, telling it like it is and always has been.” Venerable percussionist Bill Summers added the amalgam of rhythm, melody and spoken word represents “true fusion of Hip Hop, Jazz, Rap, Salsa, Rock, New Orleans, African rhythm and its classical forms.”</p>

March, 2011 issue By Eric Fine</p>
<p><strong>New Headhunting Funk Experience</strong><br />
Classic ’70s Jazz Fusion Band Returns To Studio With Surprising Guests</p>
<p>Drummer Mike Clark earned acclaim as a master of funk rhythms after joining Herbie Hancock’s Headhunters in 1973. But Clark is hardly nostalgic about his four-year tenure with the band. Ask Clark whether he thought the Headhunters would still exist more than 30 years after the band regularly backed Hancock, and Clark responds quickly: Absolutely not, he says. He would have been especially shocked with the group’s new incarnation and its planned spring release. A reunion album (Return Of The Headhunters!) in 1998 notwithstanding, the Headhunters’ new era began after a promoter asked Clark to assemble a jazz-funk band in the late 1990s for a national tour.</p>
<p>Appearing under the name Prescription Renewal, the lineup paired young players like guitarist Charlie Hunter and DJ Logic with original Headhunters bassist Paul Jackson, organ player Dr. Lonnie Smith and trombonist Fred Wesley. After percussionist Bill Summers, another original Headhunter, sat in with Clark, the two revived the Headhunters’ moniker in 2001 while adding saxophonist Donald Harrison to the lineup. Recent editions of the Headhunters continue to mix youth and experience, and have toured internationally. The band embarked on a series of dates in November at pop-oriented venues, where it performed on bills that also featured the Mumbles, a keyboard duo from London. The current group includes rapper Private Pile, and increasingly spotlights new material. It resurrects 1970s tunes like “Watermelon Man” and “Sly,” but only by request.</p>
<p>“I don’t mind playing these tunes,” Clark said, “but we put the focus on what we’re doing now. Nobody’s even thinking about the old days, [and] nobody’s reflecting back on what we did with Herbie. This is a different group of musicians, except for Bill and me.”</p>
<p>The Headhunters will release their most ambitious album since the 1970s in May. Platinum (Owl Studios) will include rapper Snoop Dogg, funk legend George Clinton and original Headhunter saxophonist Bennie Maupin.</p>
<p>Al Hall, the album’s executive producer, was reluctant to incorporate rap, but relented after establishing guidelines. “I said let’s go ahead and do it, but with three rules: no racial stuff; no heavy cursing; and no demonizing women.&#8221; And so [Clark and Summers] looked at each other and said, ‘We don’t have anything to do,’” Hall said, laughing. You should have heard the first track we had—immediately, it was all three [taboos] pulled into one or two sentences,” said Hall, who founded Owl Studios in 2005 in Indianapolis. “We’re working around that. It’s kind of a business part of it that you can’t have radio play if you’re going to be using the f-word, the n-word or all those other things.”</p>
<p>Profane or not, bassist Richie Goods said the band attracts a growing number of the young people largely absent from straight-ahead gigs. “Even if we didn’t have the rapper there’s a whole younger audience that’s into what we do,” said Goods, the Headhunters’ bassist since 2007. “But that’s the direction they want to move. Everyone’s writing a lot of music, and they recorded some new music, and they want almost like a new face for the Headhunters. I don’t think they ever want to take those vintage songs out of their repertoire, but they want to start building a new repertoire that’s just as strong as the old repertoire.” —Eric Fine – <strong>DOWNBEAT</strong>, 3/11</p>
<p>The ambitious project was also previewed via JAZZIZ.com (see below.) and The Headhunters offered fans a sneak peek of the album during a U.S. tour late last year – in advance of a local concert, The Philadelphia Inquirer hailed them as “one of the most innovative groups in history.”</p>
<p>Surprises abound on the new CD – ‘D-Funk’ is a bawdy romp featuring both Snoop Dogg and George Clinton (and is the track most likely to earn Owl Studios its first-ever ‘Explicit Content’ sticker!); ‘Salamander’ is a funky instrumental groove, a late-night hip grinder in which each member of The Headhunters gets his moment to shine; ‘Mission Statement’ is simply bad-ass, as guest rapper Jaecyn Bayne nails this one (as, of course, does the band,) asserting a memorable hook that will surely emerge as one of the highlights of the album. Advance copies will be available soon.</p>
<p>Artists appearing on The Headhunters’ ‘Platinum’ album include: Bill Summers – percussion; Mike Clark – drums; Rob Dixon &#8211; tenor sax; Derrick Gardner – trumpet; Donald Harrison &#8211; alto sax; Richie Goods –bass; Kyle Roussel – keys; Patrice Rushen – keys; Bennie Maupin &#8211; tenor sax and bass clarinet. Guest Artists on the album (subject to change) include: Killah Priest; Del the Funky Homosapien; Jaecyn Bayne; Kentyah Fraser; Snoop Dogg; George Clinton.</p>
<p>Owl Studios is an award-winning, independent record label, with an artist roster that includes a Grammy-nominated artist, two Independent Music Award winners, an American Pianists Association Jazz Fellowship recipient, and a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Performer Award recipient. In the short time since its inception, Owl Studios has become a well-respected, artist-friendly record label in the genres of Jazz, R&amp;B, Neo Soul, Jazz Fusion and Jam Band.

THE HEADHUNTERS HIT THE ROAD</p>
<p>http://www.jazziz.com/news/2010/10/22/the-headhunters-hit-the-road/</p>
<p>The storied jazz/funk/fusion band, the Headhunters, are currently finalizing tracks for Platinum, a CD set for release early next year on the Owl Studios label. The disc will feature guest appearances by several intriguing names, including Snoop Dogg, George Clinton, Killah Priest, and Del the Funky Homosapien. In the meantime, the legendary band will embark on a U.S. tour in November. (See dates, venues and cities below.)</p>
<p>Of the new album and the new year, not-overly modest Headhunters percussionist Bill Summers says: “2011 will mark the beginning of a new movement in music and jazz — the true fusion of hip hop, jazz, rap, salsa, rock, New Orleans, African rhythm and its classical forms. The Headhunters are steeped in the funk and jazz traditions. The groove is undeniable and the layers of rhythm, melody and spoken word in this release will raise the bar and set a benchmark for the world to follow. The truth of the matter is, we respect all forms of music and see a place in this unusual musical tapestry for every form of modern and ancient music forms. The project is entitled Platinum. For some this is an award presented to those who achieve a feat of reaching one million units sold and certified. For us, Platinum is a self-proclamation of achievement for creating a project deserving of recognition, and will be heard and appreciated by the millions of listeners worldwide.” The Headhunters were founded in 1973 and served as the supporting band for Herbie Hancock’s 12th studio album, Head Hunters, which became one of the best-selling jazz records ever. The Headhunters went on to record a handful of additional albums with Hancock, and they’ve also released a couple of winning platters on their own. Jazziz.com, 10/22/10</p>

<p><strong>More About THE HEADHUNTERS</strong>:<br />
Founded in 1973, they recorded their eponymous debut Head Hunters with Herbie Hancock. The Headhunters, legendary jazz-funk fusion band, immortalized as a result of their long recording and touring stint with jazz giant Herbie Hancock. Hancock&#8217;s “Headhunters” album was the first to be recorded with the group and has been heralded as the first platinum Jazz/Fusion project in history. Thrust, Flood, Manchild and other historic recordings followed. The band went on to produce more seminal records on their own, including Survival of the Fittest, which featured the funk anthem &#8220;God Make Me Funky,&#8221; one of the most sampled jazz/fusion songs in modern music history. The Headhunters&#8217; music is a complex but harmonious blend of many styles and genres, spanning the globe, from Africa to Broadway. The group is acclaimed for its musical pioneering and innovative concepts.</p>
<p><strong>More about MIKE CLARK</strong>: Originally from Oakland, California, Mike is credited with pioneering a particular style of East Bay funk drumming along with Dave Garibaldi of Tower of Power fame. Called &#8220;the most sampled drummer in hip hop&#8221; Mike&#8217;s beats have been used on tracks by musicians as diverse as NWA, Grandmaster Flash, Britney Spears, Prince and many others. His diverse genre-defying talent continues to astound audiences and influence successive generations of drummers since his explosive arrival on the music scene with Herbie Hancock and the Headhunters. It is widely accepted that Clark is one of the few, in the category of Elvin Jones and Tony Williams, to have changed the fundamental language of the drums. Clark’s Owl Studios debut, ‘Carnival of Soul’, has earned universally rave reviews.<br />
<strong><br />
More about BILL SUMMERS</strong>: To say that Bill is a percussionist is like saying a Steinway is a piano: the noun conveys none of the history and quality of the owner of the title. Born in Detroit Michigan, a veteran of Herbie Hancock&#8217;s Headhunters, knows literally hundreds of African, Cuban &amp; Latin percussion rhythms from decades of study. Bill steers the helm of the Summers Multi-Ethnic Institute of the Arts, and is a musician of the highest order, playing anything from traditional African instruments to pop bottles.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IODA, the global leader in digital distribution, marketing, and technology solutions for the independent music industry, and the Alan Lomax Archive announced a partnership to make thousands of traditional and vernacular music recordings available worldwide. </p>
<p>As part of a global grassroots campaign, Lomax and IODA will disseminate Lomax&#8217;s recordings digitally to an international network of retailers. The partnership comes on the heels of the recently released &#8220;Alan Lomax: The Man Who Recorded the World&#8221; &#8212; John Szwed&#8217;s comprehensive biography.</p>
<p>The recordings &#8212; many previously unreleased &#8212; are drawn from Lomax&#8217;s fieldwork from 1933 to 1991, during which time he sought out and recorded hundreds of hours of music from a huge diversity of cultures. They will be released on the Archive&#8217;s new label, Global Jukebox.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one has come close to Alan Lomax in illuminating the intersecting musical roots of an extraordinary range of cultures, including our own,&#8221; commented Nat Hentoff, renowned American historian, novelist, jazz and country music critic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without Lomax it&#8217;s possible that there would have been no blues explosion, no R&amp;B movement, no Beatles and no Stones and no Velvet Underground,&#8221; said Brian Eno, English musician, composer, producer, singer and visual artist, best known as one of the principal innovators of ambient music.</p>
<p><strong>America&#8217;s Legendary Folklorist</strong><br />
Alan Lomax (1915-2002) is considered America&#8217;s foremost folklorist. He dedicated his life&#8217;s work to the documentation of music and cultural traditions across the world and is perhaps best known for making the debut recordings of American legends like Lead Belly, Muddy Waters, and Woody Guthrie on behalf of the Library of Congress. But his independent explorations into the world&#8217;s traditional music took him beyond his outstanding recordings in the American South to song hunting throughout the British Isles, Spain, Italy, Morocco, Romania, the Caribbean, and the former Soviet Union, and won him a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award from the Grammy Foundation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It still remains for us to learn how we can put our magnificent mass communications technology at the service of each and every branch of the human family.&#8221; &#8211; Alan Lomax</p>
<p>A Global, Grassroots Campaign</p>
<p>Collaborations with folklore institutions like the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress and Spain&#8217;s Muséu del Pueblu d&#8217;Asturies, indie record labels Mississippi Records and Dust-to-Digital, among others, and university presses including those of the University of Nebraska and the University of Wisconsin will enable the Archive to make its more than 17,000 recordings available to diverse audiences worldwide. Through IODA&#8217;s international distribution network, Global Jukebox releases will be available at hundreds of digital retailers including iTunes, Amazon, Spotify, MOG and Rdio, and through mobile providers such as AT&amp;T, Nokia, T-Mobile, Sprint, Telefonica and Verizon.</p>
<p>Among the most highly anticipated, never-released recordings are:</p>
<p>* The Newport Folk Festival Preview Concert at New York City&#8217;s Central Park was held at the height of the Civil Rights era, in the summer of 1965. Alan Lomax produced and MC&#8217;d the concert. The concert featured seminal figures of the Folk Revival era including Reverend Gary Davis, Ed Young, Bessie Jones, Mable Hillery, and the Georgia Sea Island Singers.</p>
<p>* Alan Lomax in Morocco, 1967. Lomax recorded the traditional music of both urban and rural Morocco, setting up his tape machine in the historic metropolises of Fes and Marrakech as well as in remote rural villages in the Atlas Mountains.</p>

<p>&#8220;By enabling digital access to these recordings by the cultures and people whose legacies they represent, we expect this global collaboration to promote greater understanding of the diversity of the world&#8217;s music,&#8221; commented Erik Gilbert, VP of Client Strategy at IODA. &#8220;Our enthusiasm for this project is aligned with the enormous potential we believe it has to make a significant cultural contribution to the world&#8217;s music library.&#8221;</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Featuring Mike Moreno (guitar), Jon Ellis (saxophones), Taylor Eigsti (piano), Joe Sanders (bass), Kendrick Scott (drums, compositions)</strong><br />
 <a href="http://crossharpchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/kendrickscott.jpg"><img src="http://crossharpchronicles.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/kendrickscott.jpg?w=300&#038;h=225" alt="" title="KendrickScott" width="300" height="225" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4992" /></a><br />
Drummer/composer Kendrick Scott, founder of the artist collective label, World Culture Music, leads his band &#8220;Oracle&#8221; at The Blue Note (NYC) on February 21 in preparation for leading the band into the studio, immediately following the band&#8217;s engagement, to record his third CD as a leader.  </p>
<p>The new recording will be the much-anticipated follow up to the hugely successful release, The Source (on World Culture Music), and will feature Mike Moreno, John Ellis, Taylor Eigsti and Joe Sanders!</p>
<p><span id="more-4991"></span></p>
<p>In addition to leading &#8220;Oracle&#8221;, Scott has recently been on the road with Herbie Hancock, Gretchen Parlato, and Terence Blanchard.  </p>
<p>&#8220;Kendrick is not just a timekeeper he is a musician with big ears and a great imagination&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Herbie Hancock</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Kendrick Scott is a jazz drummer conversant in an ultramodern sense of propulsion.- <strong>Nate Chinen</strong>, The New York Times</p>
<p>&#8220;one of the rhythmic ascendants in jazz&#8221; &#8211; <strong>Josh Jackson</strong>, NPR</p>
<p>&#8220;a true artist of the highest order.&#8221;- <strong>Terence Blanchard</strong></p>
<p><strong>More on drummer/composer/WCM Founder Kendrick Scott</strong>:<br />
 In the words of Terence Blanchard, &#8220;Kendrick is a true artist of the highest order.  He is not bound by the conventional wisdom of the music world. I&#8217;ve noticed that he never says why, but rather why not.  He is exactly what the music world needs: someone with the vision and courage to press forward and expand the world of music.  I am blessed to have him around and look forward to seeing what he does every time we play.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drummer Kendrick Scott is one of jazz&#8217;s young masters of the instrument.  He was born in Houston and attended the High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, winning Downbeat Magazine student awards, IAJE&#8217;s Clifford Brown / Stan Getz award and the National Foundation for the Advancement of the Arts. Kendrick was awarded a scholarship to attend Berklee College of Music where he majored in Music Education.  As a performer, Kendrick joined The Crusaders and The Terence Blanchard Group; he has also shared the stage with Dianne Reeves, John Patitucci, Stefon Harris, Kenny Garrett, Pat Metheny, Nicholas Payton, Gary Burton, Mark Turner, Joe Lovano, Herbie Hancock, John Scofield, David Sanborn, Roy Hargrove and many more, including playing on numerous film soundtracks by Spike Lee.  Kendrick recently released &#8220;The Source&#8221;, his debut record and first World Culture Music release, to rave reviews.  With this debut, he secures his position as part of an elite group of young New York-based improvisers and composers impacting jazz around the world.</p>
<p><strong>World Culture Music</strong>:  World Culture Music is an artist collective record label and multi-faceted music company that was created by Kendrick Scott to form an alliance of like-minded musicians who are making a significant impact on both today&#8217;s jazz scene and on music in general.</p>
<p>WCM&#8217;s mission is to blur the labels in music, cross the cultural divides, bypass the corporate structure and provide the next generation of talent an outlet to fulfill their creative visions.</p>
<p>As an alternative approach to the traditional record label, World Culture Music&#8217;s objective is to bring the artist closer to the listener with no filters in creativity and honesty.  WCM provides young creative musicians an opportunity to maintain all artistic control over their music and enables the musician to decide how it will be presented to the world.  Unified under WCM, its artists can connect with their audience on a broad scale.</p>
<p>WCM presents artists of the highest caliber who are some of today&#8217;s most in-demand musicians.  Drummer Kendrick Scott, vocalist/composer Julie Hardy, trombonist Nick Vayenas, and guitarist Mike Moreno have established themselves as some of the leading musical figures of their generation.  They have played on over 35 recordings combined and performed with some of today&#8217;s top jazz artists, including Joshua Redman, Terence Blanchard, John Scofield, Nicholas Payton, Greg Osby, David Sanborn, Joe Sample, Dianne Reeves, Jeff &#8220;Tain&#8221; Watts, Michael Buble, Kenny Garrett, and Ravi Coltrane.</p>

<p>At age 37, bassist-composer Matthew Rybicki may have waited longer than most to make his first recording as a leader. But from a cursory listen to Driven, his auspicious debut as a leader, it would seem that he picked just the right time.</p>
<p> &#8220;Sometimes people get pushed out there too fast, but I really just wanted to marinate a little bit,&#8221; says the Cleveland native and longtime New York City resident who has apprenticed with the likes of Wynton Marsalis, Wycliffe Gordon, Nnenna Freelon, Victor Goines and Terell Stafford. </p>
<p><span id="more-4981"></span>&#8220;Obviously I wanted it to be something that I was going to be proud of but also I wanted to feel like there was some real weight behind it, that I believed in what I was doing enough to share it with people. I&#8217;m just at the beginning part of sharing that weight now with this record and I look forward to sharing more in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joining Rybicki on his impressive first outing are such stellar players on the New York jazz scene as pianist Gerald Clayton, drummer Ulysses Owens Jr., saxophonist Ron Blake, trumpeter Freddie Hendrix and trombonist Michael Dease. Together they demonstrate an indelible chemistry and intuitive sense of risk-taking on Rybicki&#8217;s thoughtfully crafted compositions, along with two well chosen covers. The bassist reveals a strong sense of groove throughout while his swing factor is undeniable. &#8220;It&#8217;s definitely critical for me to be trying to swing all the time, and I think we did pretty good job of representing that on the album,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It&#8217;s a high priority for me to be thinking about the dance aspect first in playing our music.&#8221;</p>
<p>That irrepressible swing factor is apparent from the opening track, &#8220;The Slow Stride,&#8221; to the bop-imbued title track (Rybicki&#8217;s homage to Oscar Pettiford with allusions to his &#8220;Tricotism&#8221;), the adventurous and interactive trio number &#8220;Seventh Son&#8221; and a blazing uptempo romp through the jazz standard&#8221;Secret Love.&#8221; A potent soloist, Rybicki testifies on the blues-soaked &#8220;Lowcountry Boil,&#8221; stretches out on the lazy, loping &#8221; A Mean Lean&#8221; and the propulsive &#8220;Big Money and the Left Side&#8221; (an homage to his former bass teacher Rodney Whitaker). Elsewhere on Driven, Rybicki acquits himself with uncommon lyricism on the waltz-time number &#8220;Someday I May Be Far Away&#8221; and the introspective ballad &#8220;Lisa&#8217;s Song.&#8221; For a bit of variety, he hits a deep groove on the traditional calypso number &#8220;Yellow Bird&#8221; and summons up an African flavored vibe on the uplifting closer &#8220;Nouakchott,&#8221; featuring percussionist Matthew Baranello and African vocalist Selloane Nkehla, who plays Rafiki in the Broadway production of The Lion King. As he explains, &#8220;&#8216;Yellow Bird&#8217; was my late parents&#8217; favorite song, so this is a tribute, in a sense. And while &#8216;Nouakchott&#8217; may not fit stylistically with the rest of the record, it does represent some of my own past. For the first five years I was in New York, I played in a world music group. During that period I made a deep study of West African music and became obsessed with the African continent. So this music is a part of me, just as the music of Oscar Peterson and Duke Ellington is a part of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Growing up in a funeral home, one of nine children of a Cleveland mortician, a teenaged Rybicki (pictured above) played electric bass in various rock &#8216;n&#8217; roll bands. His jazz epiphany came while attending the Berklee College of Music in Boston. &#8220;I&#8217;m sort of a late comer to the game, which is probably also why I wanted to wait a little bit as far as putting something out,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until I was 18 or 19 that I really got introduced to jazz. But then I got turned around and completely lost my mind on Duke Ellington at Berklee.&#8221;</p>
<p>After relocating to New York in 1995, he began working in pit bands on Broadway and at Radio City Music Hall. &#8220;Of course, it was not my preferred artistic choice but it helped pay the rent and also influenced me in terms of learning the importance of presentation in a performance. It also was a great experience to get some bow chops together. And from there, I slowly began trying to get involved with the jazz cats.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of his early hookups was with trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, a member of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. It was through Gordon that Rybicki eventually met trumpeter and JLCO artistic director Wynton Marsalis, who would become a significant mentor. &#8220;I would tag along with Wycliffe to JLCO rehearsals,&#8221; he recalls. &#8220;Rodney Whitaker was the bass player in the band then and I would actually take lessons with him during their lunch breaks. And from there they welcomed me in to be able to hang out. I started to ask Wynton some questions and he was always so giving and thoughtful with his answers. Finally he said, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you come over to the house and we&#8217;ll talk and play.&#8217; So we started playing tunes in his apartment and he started giving me little assignments. He&#8217;d say things like, &#8216;Just study the two feel of Arvell Shaw.&#8217; Or he&#8217;d ask me to transcribe and analyze the Bach chorales. It was sort of a mentor-pupil relationship at first, and over time I had the opportunity to sit in with the band and play the occasional gig with the JLCO and just develop a friendship with Wynton. He always treats me like family when we&#8217;re together. I really feel like he&#8217;s a mentor, brother, friend and drill sergeant all in one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Regarding the remarkable chemistry heard on the Driven sessions, Rybicki says, &#8220;From the outset I told the guys, &#8216;I don&#8217;t at all want to tell you what to play. I&#8217;m hiring you because I like what you do. Please bring that.&#8217; And they all did with flying colors. It&#8217;s really nice to have that combination of different personalities, and what was great about these guys is that not only do they bring their own thing but they&#8217;re able to let the music tell them what&#8217;s appropriate to play. And I think they did that completely. I really am so pleased with how everybody played on the album.&#8221;</p>
<p>Drummer Owens, Rybicki&#8217;s classmate in the Juilliard program, brings a masterful Ed Thigpen-like touch with brushes on ballads while generating kinetic, swinging energy on the kit with sticks. The underrated saxophonist Blake, a bandmate of Owens&#8217; in Christian McBride&#8217;s group, possesses a robust tone on tenor (perhaps best exemplified here on the beautiful &#8220;Lisa&#8217;s Song&#8221; and on &#8220;Big Money and the Left Side&#8221;) and nonchalantly soars on soprano (as on &#8220;Yellow Bird&#8221;). Hendrix, another colleague of Rybicki&#8217;s on the New York scene, is prominently featured on the lovely flugelhorn showcase &#8220;Someday I May Be Far Away&#8221; (which the composer titled after a famous Romare Bearden painting). Trombonist Dease, another fellow Juilliard grad, is also featured on &#8220;Yellow Bird.&#8221; A key player throughout Driven is pianist Clayton, whose keen instincts and brilliant comping elevate the proceedings from track to track. &#8220;It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s intuitive &#8211; it&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s just reacting,&#8221; says Rybicki. &#8220;He&#8217;s putting ideas down but they don&#8217;t get in the way. And it&#8217;s always swinging and just so free. He just inspired us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sean Smith</a></strong> makes a welcome return to recording with <strong><em>Trust</em></strong> &#8212; his third album as a leader, his first since 2001, and the debut  release for his own imprint, Smithereen Records. Smith&#8217;s swinging,  finely attuned quartet, which consists of guitarist <strong>John Hart</strong>, saxophonist <strong>John Ellis</strong>, and drummer <strong>Russell Meissner</strong>, is dedicated to exploring Smith&#8217;s original compositions.  <span id="more-4971"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Trust  is such a big part of what we do,&#8221; Smith says. &#8220;I trust that these guys  are going to interpret my pieces without me telling them very much.  Oftentimes they make them sound better than I had envisioned. They&#8217;ll  suggest something, or go with an idea and trust that it will be the  right thing at the moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the 12 highly melodic, evocative originals on the new CD are the bracing opener &#8220;<strong>Betting Blind</strong>,&#8221; an homage to Wayne Shorter titled &#8220;<strong>Wayne&#8217;s World</strong>,&#8221; the deceptively simple &#8220;<strong>Homemade Japanese Folk Song</strong>&#8221; (performed in a round), and the samba &#8220;<strong>Margin of Error</strong>.&#8221;  &#8220;Melody is incredibly important to me,&#8221; Smith says. &#8220;The other  foundations are crucial, but melody is usually what the tunes are based  on, not a set of chord changes that sound good to play on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Over  the past two decades, the Connecticut native has earned the respect and  confidence of his musical peers with his commanding technique, rich  tone, prolific output as a composer, and chameleon-like ability to match  his shading to a multitude of rarefied musical settings. He&#8217;s performed  and recorded with many of jazz&#8217;s most influential and revered artists,  including Benny Carter, Clark Terry, Phil Woods, Lee Konitz, Johnny  Griffin, Art Farmer, Gerry Mulligan, Tom Harrell, Peggy Lee, Andy Bey,  and Jimmy Scott. A productive four-year stint with pianist <strong>Jacky Terrasson</strong> greatly heightened his international profile.</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s  compositions have been recorded by jazz luminaries such as Phil Woods,  Bill Charlap, Leon Parker, Gene Bertoncini, Bill Mays, and vocalist <strong>Mark Murphy</strong>, who added lyrics to Sean&#8217;s &#8220;Song for the Geese&#8221; and used it as a title track for his 1998 Grammy-nominated album.</p>
<p>The bassist&#8217;s debut as a leader was the 1999 Chiaroscuro album <strong><em>Sean Smith Quartet Live!</em></strong>, with alto saxophonist Allen Mezquida, pianist Bill Charlap, and drummer Ron Vincent. Smith followed with <strong><em>Poise</em> </strong>(Ambient,  2001), which once again featured Mezquida and Charlap as well as  guitarist Keith Ganz and drummer Russell Meissner. Critic Ira Gitler has  called Smith&#8217;s work &#8220;thought-provoking music for both head and heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s  career was threatened by a March 2007 incident related to his  volunteering for a local animal shelter, when a dog he had never walked  before turned out to be a dangerous animal. The dog bit off the end of  his left middle finger, and Smith was plunged into an intense  post-surgery rehabilitation that required him to, as he puts it,  &#8220;relearn how to play several times.&#8221; He kept working throughout the  ordeal, and though he&#8217;s fully recovered now, the experience changed his  life &#8212; and the way he plays his instrument. &#8220;It forced me to prioritize  my own music,&#8221; says Smith. &#8220;For that, I&#8217;m grateful.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <strong>Sean Smith Quartet</strong> (l. to r.: Ellis, Hart, Smith, Meissner) has been together for a dozen  years in one form or another. Now that Smith has established his own  label, might jazz fans anticipate more frequent recordings from them? &#8220;I  can&#8217;t tell you how empowering it is for an artist to have complete  control over every aspect of a project &#8212; not only the music but the  entire presentation. It&#8217;s exciting,&#8221; says Smith. &#8220;I&#8217;m already looking  forward to the next CD with the quartet as I have many compositions I&#8217;d  like to record.&#8221;</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/affiliate-links/">Sean Smith Quartet</a> will perform at Birdland, New York City, on Monday, <strong>4/4</strong>, from 7:30 to 9:00 pm. ▪</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Live 2006 BBC Recording  at  New York&#8217;s Merkin Hall</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Revisits Band&#8217;s Groundbreaking  Concepts From</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Their Grammy Nominated Blue Note Albums</strong><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Unconventional.  Unheard of. Some might add unreal. Upon first listen, you&#8217;ll be struck  by the startling freshness and flat-out nerve that have become hallmark  sounds of Animation, the best rock &amp; jazz mélange you&#8217;ve never heard  of.</p>
<p><span id="more-4968"></span></p>
<p>With two Grammy nominated Blue Note CDs,<em> animation * imagination</em> (1999) <em>and re*animation LIVE!</em> (2000), the group has raised the bar for experimental music, carrying  with it infectious tinges of hip-hop, trip-hop, drum &#8216;n&#8217; bass, fusion  and whatever your own imagination might add with each new listen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The journey continues with <strong><em>Asiento</em></strong>, the group&#8217;s long-overdue album to be released on the UK-based <strong>RareNoiseRecords</strong>. Spearheaded by music visionaries <strong>Bob Belden </strong>(producer/saxophone), <strong>Tim Hagans </strong>(trumpet) and <strong>Scott Kinsey </strong>(keyboard/synthesizer), as well as <strong>Matt Garrison </strong>(bass), <strong>Guy Licata </strong>(drums) and <strong>DJ Logic </strong>(turntables), <strong>Animation</strong> re-imagines the landmark 1969 Miles Davis release <em>Bitches Brew</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A bit of history: In December 2006, as part of a series called &#8220;Reissue: Classic Recordings Live,&#8221; <strong>Belden</strong> led <strong>Animation</strong> into New York City&#8217;s famed and more classically oriented Merkin Hall  for a rare show performed by his extremely happenstance, inconspicuous  aggregate. That&#8217;s where they &#8220;re-imagined&#8221; <em>Bitches Brew</em>, and where the BBC, in tow, recorded the music for posterity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, you won&#8217;t find <em>Bitches Brew</em> played verbatim with this group. To  the contrary, Animation proves  that a group of musicians can distill the essence of a classic album  while creating a unique musical fingerprint to make it a &#8220;new original.&#8221;  <em>Asiento</em> showcases musicians taking liberties, reinventing a work  of art from 40 years ago and reinterpreting and applying the original  work to the parameters and context of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Such  now-classic material like &#8220;Miles Runs The Voodoo Down,&#8221; &#8220;Spanish Key&#8221;  and the title track, as well as other tracks from the original album,  are heard in a new setting with new and oftentimes radical perspectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there could be no better person for the task of reinventing and &#8220;re-imagining&#8221; Miles Davis and <em>Bitches Bre</em>w than <strong>Bob Belden</strong>. In 1998 he produced a four-CD box entitled <em>The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions</em>,  which included not only the six tracks from the original 1969  double-LP, but an additional 15 different songs by more or less the same  edition of the Davis ensemble that existed at that time. While working  on this reissue, <strong>Belden</strong> profited from having a strong accord with Davis&#8217; legendary producer Teo Macero. As producer for the original <em>Bitches Brew</em> sessions, Macero provided Belden with invaluable guidance on the work he did with Davis over the years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Room does not permit going into too much detail about <strong>Belden&#8217;s</strong> personal catalogue. Suffice to say, he traces the evolution of the <strong>Animation</strong> group back to the late 1980s and his innovative Treasure Island big  band, continuing on with material that&#8217;s had the main members of <strong>Animation</strong> on board to this day. His acclaimed releases &#8211; such as <em>Black Dahlia, Strawberry Fields, Tapestry, Straight To My Heart: The Music Of Sting, When Doves Cry: The Music Of Prince</em>, and Puccini&#8217;s <em>Turandot </em>- canvassed the 1990s musical terra firma and helped cement the foundation of his ever-changing musical aesthetic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, along with <strong>Belden</strong> who were those musicians who added so much to the musical proceedings? <strong>Scott Kinsey, Matt Garrison, Guy Licata</strong> and <strong>DJ Logic</strong> all played major roles in the musical creation process.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Kinsey</strong> has been like an alter ego to <strong>Belden</strong> and Hagans, now making a name for himself with his innovative group  Human Element and also having worked with such artists as the late Joe  Zawinul (Kinsey was the only keyboardist Zawinul would share the  bandstand with or let sub on gigs!), Tribal Tech with Scott Henderson,  Bill Evans. Kinsey has also had soundtrack gigs with David Holmes for  films such as <em>Ocean&#8217;s Eleven</em> through <em>Ocean&#8217;s Thirteen</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Garrison</strong>,  the son of the legendary bassist Jimmy Garrison, has worked with, among  others, Jack DeJohnette, Joni Mitchell and Herbie Hancock and currently  plays with <strong>Kinsey</strong> in <em>Human Element. </em>Additionally, <strong>Garrison</strong> recorded and toured in guitarist John McLaughlin&#8217;s project, <em>The Heart of Things </em>(Verve &#8211; 1997).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Licata&#8217;s</strong> credits include work with Bill Laswell&#8217;s Method of Defiance as well as Bernie Worrell and The Collective.</p>
<p>As for <strong>DJ Logic</strong>,  the man&#8217;s credits run long and wide and include sizeable streaks with  such names as Vernon Reid, John Mayer, Bob Weir&#8217;s Ratdog, and Medeski  Martin &amp; Wood. His background is loaded with work in and around  hip-hop, funk, soul jazz and jazz.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It makes complete sense that <strong>RareNoise</strong> should be in on the production side. Co-founded by Giacomo Bruzzo and Italian musician Eraldo Bernocchi, <strong>RareNoise</strong> credits also include working with example fellow experimentalist Bill  Laswell of M.O.D. Technologies. Yes, that same Bill Laswell, responsible  for those radical late-&#8217;90s reconstructions and remixes of electric  Miles Davis from the 1960s and &#8217;70s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Says <strong>Belden</strong> of <strong>RareNoise</strong>:  &#8220;RareNoise is way into the music. For the first time I have a company  that &#8216;gets it,&#8217; and is into the music, the band and the musicians  individually.&#8221; Speaking of Bruzzo, <strong>Belden</strong> adds, &#8220;He&#8217;s into progress and not nostalgia!!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the name of the album, <strong><em>Asiento</em></strong>,  label-head Bruzzo says it &#8220;refers to a particular level of initiation  within Santeria.&#8221; &#8220;And what is Santeria?&#8221; Bruzzo asks proverbially.  &#8220;Santeria is a syncretic religion of West African and Caribbean origin.  And a disciple who has passed the <strong><em>Asiento</em></strong> is considered,  for the first time, a fully-fledged &#8216;Santero,&#8217; a priest within the  order. This point is both one of arrival and one of departure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Referring  to the Merkin show and forthcoming album, Bruzzo concludes, &#8220;This title  wants to honor the very personal importance of that evening&#8217;s  performance, to declare that performance to be a point of arrival, but  also a point of departure for <strong>Animation</strong>. Finally, it is to provide a reference to the music and their authors without being overly explicit or subservient.&#8221;</p>
