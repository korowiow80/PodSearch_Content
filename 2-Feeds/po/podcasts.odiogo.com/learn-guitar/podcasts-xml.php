<div>You can learn basic electric guitar quite easily. All you really need is a guitar, an amplifier or a computer (or both) and a good home study guide or multimedia course.If you are even the slightest bit musically inclined then you will probably be able to pick it up quite quickly. The guitar is one of the easiest instruments to get started with and you can be playing chords and accompanying songs in a very short time.One of the main difficulties with the electric guitar is progressing from this basic guitar stage to a more advanced level of playing.</div>

<div>Is it really possible to teach yourself electric guitar?People have been teaching themselves to play the electric guitar for years and more so than any other instrument, is is very common for most guitarists to be self taught.Taking private lessons has always been a good idea but today with all of the multimedia courses available on the Internet it is very feasible to advance to quite a high level on your own. The video and audio examples if followed correctly will teach you the basics of guitar playing, show you the correct posture, how to hold your hands and which fingers to use etc.Download a multimedia home study course and teach yourself electric guitar today.</div>

<div>There are many books on how to play <a href="http://www.learnguitarelectric.com/go/jamorama1.html"  rel='nofollow' >guitar for beginners</a> and recently there have been many audio visual courses released on the market too.A few years ago, it was always advisable to find a professional teacher to give you private lessons but nowadays you can learn very efficiently and quickly by following audio and video examples of how to play.The multimedia courses on how to play guitar are mostly available on DVDs but there are an ever increasing number of these home study courses that are making their content available for immediate download online.Most of these beginner guitar courses offer free trials where they send you the first few lessons for free so you can check them out.</div>

<div>If you do a web search for electric <a href="http://www.learnguitarelectric.com/go/jamorama1.html"  rel='nofollow' >guitar for beginners</a> you will come up with hundreds of pages all offering guitar courses. Most of these will be for home study consisting of Cd&#8217;s and videos or even downloadable versions which can be purchased immediately online.These courses can be quite good and you can progress from absolute basics to a quite high level of playing in a short time. The only drawback with learning electric guitar at home on your own is that you don&#8217;t have anyone beside you to point out any bad playing habits you might be forming. These if left unchecked can become a major problem later on.A good guide is to get a home study course on electric <a href="http://www.learnguitarelectric.com/go/jamorama1.html"  rel='nofollow' >guitar for beginners</a> and then once a month or so take a one on one lesson with a professional just to make sure you stay on the right path.</div>

<div>If you have plenty of time to practice you can learn how to play the electric guitar in no time at all. The rate of advancement for absolute beginners can be quite fast.The very first few days are probably the hardest but also this is when there is more dedication and less chances of giving up. Once you have learned the finger positions for a few basic chords and have learned to strum then the sky is the limit.You&#8217;re up and running so to speak and able to play loads of different songs. It can be quite inspiring.The real difficulty when learning to play the electric guitar comes in advancing from the beginner stage to the intermediate level.</div>

<div>To learn basic <a href="http://www.learnguitarelectric.com/go/jamoramaacoustic1.html"  rel='nofollow' >acoustic guitar</a> is not as difficult as it may appear. The difficulty comes when you try to advance from beginners level to higher intermediate levels.With <a href="http://www.learnguitarelectric.com/go/jamoramaacoustic1.html"  rel='nofollow' >acoustic guitar</a>, unlike most other melodic instruments it is relatively easy to play chords. These can be easier to master than picking out melodies on individual strings. You can start with the placement of just three fingers with your left hand (right hand if you are left handed) and simply strum across all of the strings and you have a rich full sounding chord right away.Add a little simple rhythm and you&#8217;re away. Learn a couple of different of chords and learn how to change from one to the other and you will be able to play the accompaniment to many songs.You will soon realise that basic acoustic guitar need not be so difficult.</div>

<p>You could also listen to the original songs and try to copy the guitar playing but more often than not although you manage to fathom out the chords or the notes it doesn&#8217;t seem to sound the same.</p>

The rate of advancement for absolute beginners can be quite fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The very first few days are probably the hardest but also this is when there is more dedication and less chances of giving up. Once you have learned the finger positions for a few basic chords and have learned to strum then the sky is the limit.You&#8217;re up and running so to speak and able to play loads of different songs. It can be quite inspiring.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The real difficulty when learning to play the electric guitar comes in advancing from the beginner stage to the intermediate level.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://www.learnguitarelectric.com/go/jamoramaacoustic1.html"  rel='nofollow' >acoustic guitar</a>, unlike most other melodic instruments it is relatively easy to play chords. These can be easier to master than picking out melodies on individual strings. You can start with the placement of just three fingers with your left hand (right hand if you are left handed) and simply strum across all of the strings and you have a rich full sounding chord right away.</p>
<p>Add a little simple rhythm and you&#8217;re away. Learn a couple of different of chords and learn how to change from one to the other and you will be able to play the accompaniment to many songs.</p>

      <description>Playing electric guitar can be really rewarding, If you have tolerant friends or maybe even other beginner instrumentalists then you could quite easily form or join a band.
Playing electric guitar in a band is really different from playing on your own and it can also improve your playing by leaps and bounds.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you do a web search for electric <a href="http://www.learnguitarelectric.com/go/jamorama1.html"  rel='nofollow' >guitar for beginners</a> you will come up with hundreds of pages all offering guitar courses. Most of these will be for home study consisting of Cd&#8217;s and videos or even downloadable versions which can be purchased immediately online.</p>
<p>These courses can be quite good and you can progress from absolute basics to a quite high level of playing in a short time. The only drawback with learning electric guitar at home on your own is that you don&#8217;t have anyone beside you to point out any bad playing habits you might be forming. These if left unchecked can become a major problem later on.</p>
<p>A good guide is to get a home study course on electric <a href="http://www.learnguitarelectric.com/go/jamorama1.html"  rel='nofollow' >guitar for beginners</a> and then once a month or so take a one on one lesson with a professional just to make sure you stay on the right path.</p>
