      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-142" title="Making Memories SLICE Starter Kit" src="http://www.diecutfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/slice-starter-kit.jpg" alt="Making Memories SLICE Starter Kit" width="218" height="166" />The <strong>Making Memories SLICE Starter Kit</strong> has everything you need to get started making your own die cuts. Take a look at what is included:</p>
<p><strong>The SLICE Machine</strong> - If you have spent any time on this site, you probably have read plenty about this two pound digital design cutter from Making Memories.</p>
<p>This crafty machine is smaller than a five inch square, weighs less than two pounds, and can be used cordless when its rechargeable batteries are charged. It is able to turn ordinary paper, card stock, vellum, photographs, and even vinyl into die cuts, ranging in size from one inch to four inches, in half inch increments. It's easy to use too, with a simple interface and easy to read graphics window which lets you select the desired shape and size.</p>
<p><strong>Basic Shapes One Design Card</strong> - The SLICE Starter Kit includes the Basic Shapes One Design Card. Use this cartridge to make a wide variety of die cuts - 165 designs to be exact, including letters, numbers, shapes, tags, photo corners and more! We promise - you won't get bored with the Basic Shapes One cartridge, but when you are ready, there are additional design cards available, including ones that make cutouts to coordinate with popular Making Memories product lines, such as Animal Crackers and Noteworthy.</p>
<p><strong>6" X 6" Tempered Glass Cutting Mat and Repositionable Tacky Adhesive</strong> - The adhesive firmly holds the material to be cut in place on the cutting mat, yet easily releases it when finished, leaving no sticky residue on the newly created die cuts. The sturdy mat is washable and reusable, and will last through hundreds (if not thousands!) of projects. A larger mat (12” x 12”) is also available, although it does not come with the starter kit.</p>
<p><strong>Power Cord</strong> - The power cord has two functions. First, it charges the rechargeable batteries in the machine, so that the SLICE can be used approximately 45 minutes cord free. However, when the machine runs out of juice, you can keep cutting by plugging it into an electric outlet and letting the cord provide electrical power to keep it running.</p>
<p><strong>Five Blades and Blade Replacement Tool </strong>- Additional blades can be purchased separately, but there are plenty here to get started!</p>
<p>With a suggested retail price of approximately $150.00, this starter kit is an affordable way to start making your own die cuts for scrapbook layouts, handmade cards, and other paper crafting projects.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>Think Pink Design Card</strong> is included with the limited edition pink Making Memories SLICE, or it can also be purchased separately.  For those who do not yet have one of these die cut machines, the limited edition pink model is the way to go because it includes this cartridge (as well as Basic Shapes 1).  As a special bonus, a portion of the proceeds from the sale of each one of these machines goes to help in the race to find a cure for breast cancer.</p>
<p>Think Pink is one of the new MS+ Design Cards.  The "M" stands for mirroring, which allows crafters to flip and cut any of the images on the cartridge.  The "S" stands for shadowing, creating layered shadows of any of the die cut shapes.  Finally, the "+" stands for a speed boost update, installing an update on your digital design cutter to speed up the cutting process.</p>
<p>The die cuts on this design card are both feminine and pretty.  Even the font, which includes upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols, has an air of femininity to it.  Words and phrases on this cartridge reflect its pink theme of breast cancer awareness, and include triumph, survivor, love, pink, breast cancer, family, walk, race, mother, daughter, sister, Grandma, cure, therapy, experience, life, hope, strong, faith, and friends.</p>
<p>Shapes on this cartridge include silhouettes of women in a variety of poses, as well as shoes, flowers, leaves, scrolls, flourishes, frames and photo corners.</p>
<p>For anyone who knows someone who has battled breast cancer, or is interested in this cause, the <a href="http://www.diecutfun.com/slice-design-cards/">Think Pink Design Card</a> is the perfect addition to their die cutting library.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>Tag Maker Design Card</strong> for the Making Memories SLICE die cut machine gives crafters the capability to make a wide variety of tag-shaped cutouts for their scrapbook and paper crafting projects.  Although these shapes look great "as is", they really shine when embellished with rims using the tag maker tool.  This tool, also from Making Memories, crimps metal rims around the die cut tags, giving them a professional, yet custom, look.</p>
<p>Before the release of this design card, crafters who owned this tool had to use templates to hand cut tags they wanted to use in their projects.  If they wanted to avoid hand cutting, they could invest in several punches for each size and shape they wanted to cut - as you can imagine, this cost quickly added up.  However, with the introduction of the Slice Tag Maker Design Card, the time and effort needed to make these custom embellishments is significantly less than handcutting, and the cost of the design card is a fraction of the cost of investing in several punches.</p>
<p>Using the SLICE and this design card, crafters can select from a variety of sizes and shapes, including circles, squares, ovals, rectangles, and hearts.  It includes solid shaped tags, as well as ones that are further embellished with embedded shapes, including upper and lowercase letters, numbers, flowers, butterflies, stars (and more!).  These are also great to layer, using two different colors of coordinating papers.</p>
<p>For anyone who owns the SLICE, the <a href="http://www.diecutfun.com/slice-design-cards/">Tag Maker Design Card</a> is a welcome addition to their scrapbooking tool collection.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There's something that's irresistible about Halloween, and perhaps that why the <strong>Making Memories SLICE Spellbound Design Card</strong> is a favorite.  October 31st always provides ample picture-taking opportunities, and when it comes time to put the photographs of your favorite ghouls and goblins in your scrapbook album, this is one cartridge that you don't want to be without!  It's also great for making custom invitations, party favors, and treat bags for all of your "ghoulish" guests.</p>
<p>So, what's included on this "spooktacular" design card?  First, there's a font set, with upper and lowercase letters and numbers.  Of course, it's not just any font set.  No, it's creepy-looking - something Dracula would be proud of!  For each letter, there's three different ways that you can cut it out, providing for lots of mixing and matching.</p>
<p>There are also lots and lots of pumpkins, from traditional pumpkin patch shapes to grinning (and grimacing!) jack o' lanterns.  Ghosts, spiders, creepy eyes, black cats, haunted houses, ravens and bats, skeletons, witches hats and Halloween candy, and even gravestone markers are included on the Making Memories Spellbound cartridge.  If you love Halloween, there's no doubt about it - you will love this design card!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.diecutfun.com/slice-design-cards/">Making Memories SLICE Spellbound Design Card</a> will make die cuts ranging in size from one to four inches.  It will cut die cuts from a variety of materials - so have fun with it.  Cut ghosts shapes from murky white vellum, or use it to cut vinyl pumpkins to decorate your windows.  You are limited by only your imagination!</p>
