      <content:encoded><![CDATA[How would you like to <b>get toned abs fast</b>, easy, and without resorting to some type of fad diet or diet pills? Alright, take some time out of your day to read this article here and learn more about the 2 most effective ways to lose belly fat and get a much more toned midsection extremely fast!<br />
<br />
Okay, first things first. You must understand that in order to "see" six pack abs, your body fat percentage must be at or below 10%. Therefore, please understand that in order to get that toned look on your belly, you have to remove belly fat FIRST. Never approach this with the mindset that all you need to do is some ab crunches, leg raises, or some type of abdominal machine and BOOM... you just got yourself some abs!<br />
<br />
Now, if removing belly fat is the most important part, then what you need to focus on more than anything else is what goes in your belly... PROPER nutrition. This is the absolute most important step in your quest to get toned abs fast.<br />
<br />
What you must do is get all types of nutrients in your diet (protein, fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals) without restricting ANYTHING! Therefore, I strongly recommend that you avoid fad dieting because that type of dieting will actually slow your metabolism down... which is very counterproductive since a slow metabolism causes your body to STORE fat instead of burning it off!<br />
<br />
Also, in regards to proper nutrition, make sure that you are not reducing calories too much. I recommend that you only reduce calories by no more than 300 calories below your daily maintenance calorie intake level. So, if you are supposed to get 2,000 calories daily to maintain your current weight, then reduce that number down to no less than 1,700 calories. Doing this makes sure that your metabolism will not decrease.<br />
<br />
The second most important step in order to lose belly fat... and total body fat for that matter, is to make sure that you get your metabolism elevated to the maximum peak and keep it running strong through out the entire day. The way to make that possible is to make sure that you stick with 100% natural methods for boosting the metabolism. The most natural way is with step #1 (proper nutrition).<br />

      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~3/4f0t8gGQlv0/fastest-way-to-lose-inches-off-your.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2010 16:46:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you want to <b>lose inches off your waistline</b> in the first 2 weeks without starving, without depriving, and without doing anything harmful or unnatural? Well, take just a little bit of time out of your hectic day to day to read this article here and discover 3 important tips that helped me lose inches and melt fat off lightning fast!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-nY4BIjyI/AAAAAAAACS8/l1PnpB6MT74/s1600/slim+down+waist.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-nY4BIjyI/AAAAAAAACS8/l1PnpB6MT74/s320/slim+down+waist.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div><br />
1.) Alright, the first thing you are going to want to do is make sure that you are getting 100% proper nutrition WITHOUT restricting nutrients. You must make sure that you are getting protein, complex carbs such as fiber and whole grains, healthy fats such as omega and monounsaturated, and foods rich in vitamins and minerals (fruits/vegetables.)<br />
<br />
I highly recommend that you don't get caught up with those popular fad diets you see everywhere you turn. Those types of programs are based around restricting particular types of nutrients and/or calories from your diet... and that's a big no-no! Restricting calories and/or important nutrients will ultimately cause your metabolism to decrease... which leads to yo-yo weight loss and your body will store fat on you instead of burning it off!<br />
<br />
2.) The next thing you are going to want to do is make sure that you increase your metabolism to the maximum peak... NATURALLY! Do not boost your metabolic rate with unnatural methods such as diet pills or some other type of dangerous fad. What you want to do to get the best results is to boost your metabolism with using nothing but proper nutrition.<br />
<br />
Doing that will yield the best results, and not to mention, since you are increasing your metabolism naturally, once you lose the weight... it stays off!<br />
<br />
3.) Okay, now the final thing that you want to do in order to <b>lose inches off your waistline</b> lightning fast is to eat multiple times daily (4-5 small healthy meals) instead of the usual 2-3 large meals. The reason being is twofold. Firstly, you will not starve due to the frequent small meals you'll be eating during the day. Secondly, by eating more frequently through out the day, you will end up causing your metabolism to SKYROCKET to the maximum peak... consistently.<br />
<br />
Alright my friend, those are the top 3 tips that helped me lose inches faster, easier, and permanently. However, please take note that nothing is going to work fast for you unless you are 100% consistent. Plan before you begin dieting, stick to that plan, and FINISH!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you want to <b>lose 15 lbs. fast</b>, easy, and keep it off permanently? Read on to discover the top 5 weight loss tips to get slim lightning fast and with ease!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-mrH7iJZI/AAAAAAAACS0/Jbl7u0yTdq8/s1600/fastweightloss.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-mrH7iJZI/AAAAAAAACS0/Jbl7u0yTdq8/s320/fastweightloss.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div><br />
#1.) Increase the amount of water you drink to 1/2 your body weight in ounces. So, if you weigh 150 pounds, you would drink 75 ounces of water each day. What is drinking this much water going to do? Well, let's see here:<br />
<br />
* You are going to get rid of harmful toxins in your body that are keeping fat cells on you!<br />
* You will be assisting your body in quickly building and repairing muscle tissue. The more muscle tissue you have on your body... the more you will automatically burn away stubborn fat!<br />
* Drinking a lot of water will cause your body to release water from your body (better known as water weight).<br />
<br />
Just watch what happens after drinking plenty of water for the first week! You are going to notice a tremendous difference in how you look and feel!<br />
<br />
#2.) Get ALL nutrients in your diet! Do not fall for those low carb, low fat, low calorie types of programs. Restricting nutrients from your body is only going to cause your metabolism to decrease. And if your metabolism decreases... this ultimately leads to STORED body fat and yo-yo weight loss!<br />
<br />
#3.) Sleep 7-8 hours every night and keep your body at room temperature. Getting plenty of sleep EVERY NIGHT will allow your body to burn calories and build muscle tissue while you rest! You can actually burn up to 500 calories or more just by getting a full nights rest!<br />
<br />
#4.) Make sure that you increase your metabolism and prevent it from decreasing. The faster you get your metabolic rate with NATURAL METHODS, the faster you are going to lose pounds of fat. Not only that, since boosting your metabolism is a natural weight loss methods, once you lose the weight... it will stay off for good.<br />
<br />
Now please take my advice on this... AVOID diet pills and fad diets for many reasons, but also because those things will SLOW your metabolism down! Did you know that the consequence of a slow metabolism is that your body will begin to STORE fat instead of burning it off, and also your body will end up with yo-yo weight loss (you lose weight and then the weight comes right back on)!<br />
<br />
#5.) The final tip to help you <b>lose 15 lbs. fast</b> is the most important... STAY CONSISTENT! Consistency is the absolute most important part of dieting.<br />

      <title>How Do You Flatten the Stomach Fast? Here's the Best Method to Get a Flat Stomach in 1 Month!</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~3/zVWcJewAKdg/how-do-you-flatten-stomach-fast-heres.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2010 16:38:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you been trying to figure out <b>how do you flatten the stomach fast</b>... BUT, also easily, naturally, and permanently? Okay, take a little break from your busy day to read this article here and learn more about the most effective way to ensure you get a flat stomach extremely fast!<br />
<br />
Alright, now the first thing you should know is that the fat around the midsection area is extremely stubborn and it's going to take 100% natural methods to ensure that not only you lose the fat... IT STAYS OFF FOR GOOD! Therefore, I strongly recommend that you avoid:<br />
<br />
* Diet Pills<br />
* Fad Diets (low carb, low fat, low calorie, starvation, etc.)<br />
<br />
Those types of weight loss methods are extremely ineffective and unsafe due to the fact that they will firstly cause a reduction in your metabolism, and secondly, they'll cause a myriad of other health issues.<br />
<br />
Now, the best method that you can do in order to get a flat stomach has nothing to do with some type of exercise, it has to do with something that is ranked as the most important part of changing your body... and that would be getting proper nutrition along with increasing your metabolism.<br />
<br />
Getting proper nutrition and boosting your metabolism by changing how you eat will cause that stubborn stomach fat to melt away much more faster, easier, and permanent.<br />
<br />
The reason this is the most effective way to <b>flatten the stomach fast</b> is because getting the correct nutrients in your body to not only increase your metabolism to the peak, but to also simply just provide your body with the nutrients it craves is what causes your body to work more efficiently and breaking down fat.<br />
<br />
If you follow a dieting system that incorporates both getting proper nutrition and boosting your metabolism to the highest peak, you will most certainly see much more faster and consistent results. Just make sure that you get a program that WILL NOT have you restrict nutrients from your body.<br />
<br />
Remember, your body craves ALL nutrients (protein, complex carbs such as fiber, healthy fats such as monounsaturated, and foods rich in vitamins/minerals), and when you restrict these nutrients by using some type of fad diet, the only thing that happens is a slower metabolism and yo-yo weight loss!<br />

      <title>Lose 25 Lbs In 4 Weeks - The Top 4 Ways to Effectively &amp; Permanently Lose a Ton of Weight With Ease</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~3/MQlj4Dsoa8o/lose-25-lbs-in-4-weeks-top-4-ways-to.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2010 16:36:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[To <b>lose 25 lbs. in 4 weeks</b>, it DOES NOT take a miracle and it IS easy to do... contrary to what you always hear, see, and read! In this article here, I'll explain the top 4 ways to make losing a lot of weight in a short period of time possible!<br />
<br />
1.) Are You Ready? - It's simple when you think about it, but that question really could make the difference as to whether you will successfully lose weight or not. You MUST make sure that you are ready to stick with your diet for the long haul BEFORE you start! If you feel as though you are not ready to begin a health and fitness program, DO NOT start.<br />
<br />
The reason why this is so important is due the fact that if you start when you are not ready, you will find it more harder to stick with your program.<br />
<br />
Make sure you make a plan for your weight loss goals and do what you can to get yourself motivated to start. It could be setting a special date to begin, etc.<br />
<br />
2.) Nutrition, FIRST! - Never put diet pills, exercise, or anything else above making sure that you are getting 100% proper nutrition in your plan. NOTHING will ever work unless you are eating properly.<br />
<br />
3.) The Metabolism - Making sure that your metabolism is running as strong as possible is a surefire way to guarantee that you'll burn away 25 lbs. of fat in 4 weeks... permanently! With that said, make sure you are not getting caught up with things that could end up slowing down your metabolism such as fad dieting, diet pills, starving yourself, and/or restricting nutrients from your diet.<br />
<br />
4.) Consistency - Again, this is also something simple when you think about it, however, you will be surprised at how important staying consistent is to getting results, and how detrimental it is if you are not consistent. If you do everything right for the first week, and then you slip the next week, the results are just not going to be what you expected.<br />
<br />
Staying 100% consistent is the base of anything you do. Which is why #1 above is so important. In order to stay consistent, you firstly have to make sure that you are ready to start dieting to begin with.<br />
<br />
My friend, if you follow those 4 principles above, and if you go on a smart diet program based around getting proper nutrition and skyrocketing your metabolism such as <a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info/"><b>THIS ONE HERE</b></a>, then you will most certainly be able to effectively, easily, and permanently <b>lose 25 lbs. in 4 weeks</b>.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-6113055431292425742?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/MQlj4Dsoa8o" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you want to be able to get flat abs fast, easy, and without having to starve yourself in order to get results? Well, take just a little bit of time out of your day to read this article here and learn more about the single most effective way to lose fat off your stomach starting today!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-j8yT0vtI/AAAAAAAACSs/3g2nEyWvwH4/s1600/belly-fat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-j8yT0vtI/AAAAAAAACSs/3g2nEyWvwH4/s320/belly-fat.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div><br />
Okay my friend, before I go into what is going to work best for you to get a flatter belly, let me first talk to you about some things that are NOT going to work:<br />
<br />
1.) Fad dieting - Those low carb, low fat, low calorie, starvation, celebrity, etc. types of diet plans are very ineffective, very unsafe, and very expensive! The consequence of those types of plans is that they will end up slowing down your metabolism and they can cause a plethora of other health concerns.<br />
<br />
In theory, you would think that those types of diets would work but the problem is that your body actually needs carbs (complex carbs such as fiber), your body needs fats (healthy fats such as fish, nuts, and olive oil), and your body needs a good amount of calories to prevent it from going into "starvation mode" (a reduction in your metabolism)!<br />
<br />
2.) JUST ab exercises - Please, do not become another statistic of folks who think that just doing some type of ab exercise is going to help you get flat abs! Ab exercises are ONLY going to tone the muscles UNDER the belly fat... not remove the fat.<br />
<br />
Alright, now that we have what you shouldn't do covered, let's talk about the single best way to lose tummy fat:<br />
<br />
The most effective way to ensure that you'll lose that gut quickly is by increasing the rate of your metabolism, BUT by doing so with proper nutrition. Let me explain...<br />
<br />
You see, there are many ways that you can increase your metabolism. You can do so with diet pills (I don't recommend you take them), higher intensity exercises, and more. However, if you increase your metabolism by changing how you eat, not only will you lose belly fat quicker and easier, you will also lose a ton of weight lightning fast too! <a href="http://ajbarnes.4idiots.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=getflatpost">Click Here</a> for an amazing dieting system that will skyrocket your metabolism and cause you to lose 9 pounds of fat every 11 days!<br />
<br />
The reason combining proper nutrition and boosting your metabolism works extremely well is due to the fact that food is the most effective way to increase your metabolic rate. Therefore, this is why those "low carb", "low fat", "low calorie" diets do not work... because you end up RESTRICTING what your body wants... FOOD!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-5286133582914199144?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/d_W-Q34ACMg" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Want to Lose Weight Lightning Fast? Here's How to Easily Lose 25 Pounds of Fat Every Month!</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~3/QwgxevlQUbA/want-to-lose-weight-lightning-fast.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2010 16:27:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[In order to <b>lose 25 pounds every month</b>, there are a couple of things that you can do and there a couple things you should avoid. In this article, we are going to cover what those things are so that you can FINALLY get that body you deserve!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br />
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-jP0g5OQI/AAAAAAAACSk/vuntCgWwkFk/s1600/loseweightfast.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-jP0g5OQI/AAAAAAAACSk/vuntCgWwkFk/s320/loseweightfast.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div>Alright, the first thing I'm going to help you with is what you should avoid if you want to not only lose weight quickly... but also keep it off for good!<br />
<br />
A.) Avoid fad dieting - In theory, the low fat, low calorie, and low carb types of programs "seem" like they would work, but I'm here to tell you that your body is going to be pretty mad at you if you get on those programs!<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Well, the human body requires ALL types of nutrients in order to effectively work to do all of it's duties... including properly metabolizing fat. Also, the body needs a good amount of calories without you restricting too much.<br />
<br />
Restricting calories too severely will trigger your body to sense that you are starving yourself. Guess what happens if your body thinks you are starving? It is going to begin to store whatever calories you eat... AS FAT! This occurs because your metabolism is reduced during starvation and/or restricting nutrients.<br />
<br />
B.) Diet pills - Not all diet pills are bad, but I still recommend that you avoid them. Psychologically diet pills can cause you to go into the mindset that "it's okay to eat bad because you THINK the pills will remove the fat and/or reduce the calories".<br />
<br />
Physically diet pills can be bad because some of them will REDUCE your metabolism and they will also "only" reduce water weight... not actual pounds of fat! Guess what happens if you lose water weight and then start drinking a lot of water (which you also need to do in order to get great results by the way)... that's right, you are going to regain weight right back (better known as yo-yo weight loss)!<br />
<br />
Now, what I recommend for you TO DO in order to <a href="http://www.thefatloss4idiotsdietplan.info/"><b>lose 25 lbs. every month</b></a> is to make sure you get 100% proper nutrition and that you also boost your metabolism to the highest peak.<br />
<br />
Eating properly (which means getting all types of nutrients without severely reducing calories) and boosting your metabolism with food is the absolute most effective way to not only lose a lot weight quickly... but also extremely easy.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you ready to finally <b>get rid of excess fat</b> fast, easy, and permanently? Okay, take just a couple of minutes out of your day to read this article here and learn more about 5 proven ways to get extreme fat loss starting today!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-iK5poOVI/AAAAAAAACSU/5oqVnOYc_FU/s1600/best+fat+loss+system.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-iK5poOVI/AAAAAAAACSU/5oqVnOYc_FU/s320/best+fat+loss+system.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div><br />
1.) Increase Your Metabolism - The faster you get your metabolic rate, the faster you are going to melt away pounds of fat. On the flip side, the slower your metabolism is, the slower you are going to lose weight.<br />
<br />
To prevent your metabolism from decreasing, make sure you DO NOT fad diet (low carb, low fat, low calorie, etc.). Also, I highly recommend that you avoid diet pills. Yes, they do mention that they will boost your metabolism, but what do you think is going to happen when you stop taking them?<br />
<br />
To increase your metabolism naturally, I highly recommend you do so with proper nutrition. There are a couple of well know diets that will boost your metabolism with proper nutrition.<br />
<br />
2.) Speaking Of Nutrition - Be sure that you get ALL types of nutrients in your diet for best results. Your body LOVES many different types of nutrients and when you restrict getting any of them, you are going to make your body upset... hence your metabolism slowing down as mentioned in #1!<br />
<br />
I recommend that you get protein, fiber, healthy fats (such as monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and Omega), and foods rich in vitamins and minerals such as fruits (especially apples and berries), and vegetables (especially greener veggies such as broccoli and spinach).<br />
<br />
3.) Plan - Never begin dieting without planning. "Failing to plan is planning to fail".<br />
<br />
4.) K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid) - Do not make dieting so complicated if you want to truly get lightning fast results. Why is that? Well, the more easier you approach losing weight, the easier it will be to stick with your plan. There are many easy diet programs out there and those are the types I recommend you go on... especially if you have a hard time sticking with a diet.<br />
<br />
5.) Consistency Is Key - One of the most popular quotes in N.F.L football is simple... FINISH! You want to <a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info/"><b>get rid of excess fat fast</b></a>... you have to FINISH whatever it is you do to reach that goal. Fat is stubborn, and it will not be removed if you are not 100% consistent with what it is you are doing to reach your goals.<br />
<br />
You can do it! Trust in yourself, plan before you start, keep it simple, and FINISH!<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to <b>lose 20 pounds fast</b>, there are 2 simple ways you can ensure that you lose this much and in less than 1 month. Just take a couple of minutes out of your day to read this article here and learn more about what you can do....<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-hSFq4LJI/AAAAAAAACSM/C526sm3PlOI/s320/0000000000001fatlossbeforeandafater.jpg" /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div>Okay my friend, now the first thing you must make sure you do before you even start is that you commit yourself to staying 100% consistent with whatever diet program you get started with. That is the absolute most important part of being on a diet... staying consistent. You will be amazed at how quickly you'll get results just as long as you do everything the diet has planned for you... consistently!<br />
<br />
Alright, now let's talk about those 2 simple methods to ensure that you <b>lose 20 pounds fast</b>, easy, and permanently.<br />
<br />
#1.) Increase your metabolic rate. By making sure that you get your metabolism as high as possible and by keeping it running strong through out the entire day, not only will you see pounds of fat melt away much quicker... it will stay off for good because losing weight by increasing your metabolism is 100% natural.<br />
<br />
Now, boosting your metabolism is great... but just as long as you do so with natural methods. Unnaturally increasing your metabolic rate such as with diet pills will have serious adverse effects on your body and I highly recommend that you avoid them. Also, I recommend that you avoid those fad diets such as low carb, low calorie, low fat, starvation, etc. because they will actually SLOW DOWN your metabolism!<br />
<br />
Look for a program that is based on increasing your metabolism using the greatest and most natural way... PROPER nutrition!<br />
<br />
#2.) The next simple method to lose a lot of weight quickly is to increase the amount of water you drink... GREATLY. I'm not talking about the recommended 8 glasses a day, I'm talking about taking in 1/2 your body weight in ounces (YES, that MUCH!).<br />
<br />
By increasing the amount of water you get daily, you will be able to get rid of excess water weight, boost your metabolism, flush out harmful toxins in your body that may be keeping those pounds of fat on your body, and so much more!<br />
<br />
To save money, what I recommend that you do is to go get one of those filtration systems that you can attach to your faucet instead of getting spring water. You can save a ton of money over time using one of the systems.<br />
<br />
If you follow those 2 simple methods above, you will most certainly not only <a href="http://howtoburnthefatoff.blogspot.com/"><b>lose 20 pounds fast</b></a>, but once you lose the weight, you will find it much more easier to maintain the weight and it will all stay off FOR GOOD!<br />

      <pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2010 16:11:00 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to <b>lose a pants size fast</b>, then I have good news for you. It's not going to require that you starve, restrict foods, or pop pills! Take just a couple of minutes out of your day today to read on and see exactly what you are going to need to do in order to fit your skinny jeans in 2 weeks or less!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://bit.ly/a2ELFd"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-gSiXOXuI/AAAAAAAACSE/4xNYal5YUXQ/s320/calorie+shfiting.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div><br />
You see, being able to lose a lot of weight as quickly as possible is not as difficult as most make it out to be... and I'm going to tell you the secret on how to make sure dieting is as easy as possible. Are you ready to have your socks blown off with this MEGA secret? The secret is plan, journal, and consistency! That's right, those are the 3 first things you must do in order to make losing weight as effective and easy as possible!<br />
<br />
Planning - By firstly planning out your weight loss goals, you are making sure that you have a clear goal set in mind while you are making your transformation. This will keep you focused.<br />
<br />
Journal - By keeping a journal of everything it is that you are doing as far as dieting and exercising you will be able to hold yourself accountable to what it is you are doing each and every day. Once I started keeping a journal of my journey, I actually found it a whole lot more fun to diet! What I recommend you do with a journal is simply take account of what you are eating each day, how many calories you are getting, and the type of nutrients you are consuming.<br />
<br />
Consistency - My friend, trying lose weight fast will never work if you are not 100% consistent with everything you do. Consistency is the ultimate rule to ensuring that you'll lose inches and pounds as fast as possible. You can't diet and exercise for a week, then not see the results you wanted, then you quit for one month, then you start up again... and then complain all over again. If you want consistent results, you have to stay consistent with your dieting and exercising efforts.<br />
<br />
Now, with all that said, the one thing I strongly recommend that you do if you want to <b>lose a pants size fast</b> is to make sure that you are getting 100% proper nutrition and also that you get your metabolism as high as possible.<br />
<br />
By ensuring that you get the proper nutrients (proteins, complex carbs such as fiber, healthy fats such as monounsaturated, and foods rich in vitamins and minerals such as fruits and veggies), and by making sure that you boost your metabolism with a 100% all natural method, you will most certainly find pounds of fat melting away quicker, easier, and permanently.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you have been wondering how to <b>lose 10 pounds in 2 weeks</b>, then this article here will help get you started in the right direction. Read on to learn more about exactly what it would take in order to get accelerated weight loss and fat loss easier, quicker, and PERMANENTLY!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-ekocjkgI/AAAAAAAACR8/H62n0TucOFc/s1600/fastweightloss.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-ekocjkgI/AAAAAAAACR8/H62n0TucOFc/s320/fastweightloss.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div><br />
#1.) Alright, now the first thing you have to do is forget everything you've heard about low carbs, low fat, and restricting several calories in order to lose pounds of fat fast. The reason why is because doing those types of things is a surefire way to end up slowing down your metabolism. Not only that, you will end up having a loss of energy, you'll lose muscle tissue, and you will end up getting VERY strong cravings for bad foods!<br />
<br />
What does work as far as nutrition is concerned?<br />
<br />
Well, the best thing to do is make sure that you are getting plenty of ALL types of nutrients in your daily diet to prevent your body from slowing down the metabolism. You are going to need protein, fiber (complex carbs), fats (healthy fats such as monounsaturated), and foods packed with vitamins and minerals such as fruits and vegetables. Also, make sure that you do not restrict calories by no more than 300 calories below the amount required to MAINTAIN your current weight level.<br />
<br />
#2.) The second most important part in order to successfully <b>lose 10 pounds in 2 weeks</b> is none other than making sure that you get plenty of delicious, refreshing, and 100% FREE, water! Trust me on this, start drinking 1/2 your body weight in ounces of water each day and watch what happens in the first week!<br />
<br />
Don't want to wait to find out what happens? Well, what's going to happen is that you are going to end up releasing stored water weight and you are going to flush out harmful toxins in your body that may be keeping you fat!<br />
<br />
The end result is that you are going to notice a dramatic drop in weight in your first week! Now, rest assure, if you simply make sure you stay consistent with drinking plenty of water daily, then you won't have to worry about getting yo-yo weight loss (you lose the weight... and then the weight comes right back on).<br />
<br />
#3.) The third most important step in order to get fast results is to make sure that you get your metabolism elevated to the highest peak and also ensure that it does not decrease by any means necessary. This is why I always recommend for folks to avoid those super crazy fad diets, celebrity diets, and dangerous diet pills! Those types of things will end up causing your metabolism to severely decrease... not to mention a plethora of other health concerns will come about.<br />

      <title>Lose Midsection Fat Fast - The Top 3 Ways to Flatten Your Midsection in Under 1 Month Easy!</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2010 16:06:47 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you want to <b>lose midsection fat fast</b>, easy, and without having to deal with starvation, diet pills, or some type of crazy fad diet? Well, read on to discover the top 3 ways to flatten your midsection in under 1 month easily, quickly, and keep the pounds of fat off for good!<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-dZff_wAI/AAAAAAAACR0/4f9QQAaqKvs/s1600/abdominal+fat+reduction.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TI-dZff_wAI/AAAAAAAACR0/4f9QQAaqKvs/s320/abdominal+fat+reduction.jpg" /></a></div><div style="text-align: center;"><br />
</div><br />
1.) Lean Muscle Tissue - One of the most important ways to ensure that you'll melt away pounds of stubborn fat not only quickly and easily, but also to the point where your body will get that sexy toned look is to make sure that you are building lean muscle tissue. You see, the more lean muscle tissue you have on your body, the more your body is going to naturally burn away total body fat... even while you sleep (your body burns calories while it is repairing and growing your muscle cells).<br />
<br />
Now I'm not talking about becoming the next great HUGE bodybuilder, I'm just referring to making sure that include some form of resistance training into your workout to ensure you are building muscle. Also, I recommend that you focus on exercising just one muscle group per week to make sure that you are not over-training.<br />
<br />
2.) Protein - Now, you need to get all types of nutrients in your diet (which is why I always recommend to avoid fad diets such as those low carb, low fat, low calorie types), but making sure that you get plenty of protein is vital. The reason being is primarily directly related to #1... building lean muscle. Protein will ensure proper development of muscle tissue... which leads to quicker fat loss.<br />
<br />
The best types of proteins to get in your diet will be foods rich in lean protein. An ideal rule to go by if you are just trying to lose weight and fat is to make sure you get about 1/2 gram of protein per pound of body weight. If you are trying to build larger muscles, I recommend that you get 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight.<br />
<br />
3.) Metabolism - A surefire way to ensure you'll <a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info/"><b>lose midsection fat fast</b></a> is to make sure you firstly don't reduce your metabolism, and to secondly, naturally boost your metabolism to the highest peak. Here are some do's and dont's for your metabolism:<br />
<br />
* The things I recommend for you to not do so that you'll prevent your metabolism from slowing down would be fad dieting, diet pills, starvation.<br />
* The things that I strongly recommend that you do to ensure you'll BOOST your metabolism is eating more frequently through out the day, adding spices to your foods, and making sure to do both weight training and cardiovascular exercises at least 4 times a week.<br />
<br />
Now, if you really want to "<a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info/"><b>Lose Midsection Fat Fast</b></a>" and also drop 9 pounds EVERY 11 DAYS, then I highly recommend the "Calorie Shifting Diet" from Fat Loss 4 Idiots since this diet program will SKYROCKET YOUR METABOLISM to the highest peak... consistently! I lost an AMAZING 50 lbs. of fat in 8 weeks using this online plan and I did not regain 1 pound back!<br />

      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~3/y-0Izb2RCME/best-yogurt-for-weight-loss-and-3-ways.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2010 15:49:44 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TDH61dubJ8I/AAAAAAAACRc/jawGpR4uJWA/s1600/chobani+greek+yogurt.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_iBaogoSxAIo/TDH61dubJ8I/AAAAAAAACRc/jawGpR4uJWA/s320/chobani+greek+yogurt.jpg" /></a></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"></span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Have you been looking for the <b>best yogurt for weight loss</b>? Well, the best kind may not be what you were expecting.<br />
<br />
You have many different types of yogurts on the market today ranging from low fat, low calorie, non-fat, regular, organic, and more. Almost all yogurts receive high marks for taste, but the question is: What yogurt will work best for effectively losing weight, losing fat, and building muscle?<br />
<br />
Well, just about all of the low fat, low calorie, and non-fat yogurts that most people deem as being healthy is in fact not really that healthy. This is because they contain lots of sugar, artificial sweeteners, high fructose corn syrup, and other ingredients that are not healthy.<br />
<br />
After looking all over, the most healthiest... (and tastiest for that matter) yogurt that I have found is organic Greek yogurt. The best brand, IMO, is Chobani.<br />
<br />
Here is the nutritional data for a 6 ounce blueberry Chobani Greek yogurt:<br />
<br />
Calories: 140<br />
Fat: None<br />
Cholesterol: None<br />
Sodium: 65mg<br />
Carbs: 20g<br />
Protein: 14 g (protein is even higher on some other flavors!)<br />
Calcium: 20%<br />
<br />
As you can see, the calories are right in line with most of the so called "healthy yogurts", but notice how the protein is about TRIPLE the amount of most popular yogurts (which is around 5 grams)!<br />
<br />
This yogurt makes an excellent post workout meal since it contains the simple carbs (sugar) that you need to help with recovery, and it contains a plethora of protein to help in repairing muscle tissue.<br />
<br />
The other thing I really like about this yogurt is the taste. It is freaking delicious! My favorite flavors are vanilla, blueberry, and strawberry. The flavor I wouldn't recommend is plain... ewww!<br />
<br />
The only catch with this type of yogurt is the price compared to other brands. For one container at most stores, it will range anywhere from $1.25 - $1.60 each. When you think about it, it's not really that bad considering the amount of protein it contains and of course the other health benefits.<br />
<br />
So, if you have been searching all over for the <b>best yogurt for weight loss</b> and you're confused about all the different brands out there, I strongly recommend you look into getting 100% organic Greek yogurt.</span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br />
</span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Oh yeah, 3 cool ways you can make yogurt taste even better than ice cream is to either freeze it for a frozen treat, add fruits to it (berries, bananas, etc.), or add gram crackers to it!&nbsp;</span><br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you done many things trying to <span style="font-weight: bold;">burn belly fat fast</span>, but nothing ever seems to get you that perfect flat sexy midsection you've always wanted? Well, take some time out of your busy day today and read this article here and learn more about the top 2 tips that will help you get rid of stubborn fat lightning fast!<br /><br />Step #1 - The first thing that you are going to have to do is make sure that you are getting 100% proper nutrition.<br /><br />This means that you are going to have to not only eat the proper foods, you are also going to have to change how you eat and when you eat. I'll explain:<br /><br />What you should eat in order to ensure that you lose fat off your stomach quickly is plenty of several different nutrients with no restrictions. You can not restrict nutrients such as carbs, fats, and even calories if you want to lose weight. The reason why is because our bodies need carbs (good carbs such as fiber), fats (monounsaturated), and you are going to need the appropriate amount of calories without reducing them too much.<br /><br />Why do you need to make sure you don't restrict nutrients? Well, because since our bodies need those nutrients and calories, by restricting them, this is going to cause the metabolism to slow down... which will then lead to stored fat!<br /><br />Step #2 - Okay, now the next thing that you are going to have to do is make sure that you increase your metabolic rate to the maximum peak with 100% natural methods. Getting a much more faster metabolism naturally is a surefire way to getting a flatter belly quickly and easily.<br /><br />You see, in order to burn away stubborn fat such as that on the belly, you have to do the most aggressive way to lose a lot of fat quickly... and that would be to boost your metabolism to the highest peak. If you do so, not only will you easily lose pounds of fat as quickly as possible, once you lose the weight, it will all stay off permanently.<br /><br />Now, if boosting metabolism is a great way to ensure you'll burn belly fat fast, then obviously reducing your metabolism would most certainly be a bad thing! This is the exact reason why I always recommend people looking to start dieting to make sure that they avoid getting diet pills and fad diets.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Well, because those types of things will ultimately end up causing your metabolism to decrease. Coincidentally, if your metabolism decreases... this will actually lead to yo-yo weight loss (you lose the weight... and then regain it back), and your body will store fat instead of burning it off!<br /><br />>> Want to <a href="http://www.thefatloss4idiotsdietplan.info"><span style="font-weight: bold;">burn belly fat</span></a> in 11 days? <a href="http://www.thefatloss4idiotsdietplan.info"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Click Here</span></a> for an easy online fat loss program that is instantly downloaded and will help you shed inches off your stomach in the first two weeks.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-4833466862279632933?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/mcuubK2ztwc" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are you looking to <span style="font-weight: bold;">lose body fat fast</span>, but no matter what it is you do, nothing ever seems to work? Well, take a little bit of time out of your day to read on and learn more about the top 3 tips to lose fat and get thinner extremely fast!<br /><br />Okay, now the very first thing you have to do is make sure you are getting 100% proper nutrition in your diet... with no restrictions. Restricting carbs, fats, and/or calories (such as with FAD DIETS!) is only going to cause your metabolism to decrease. Consequently, if your metabolism decreases, this will most certainly lead to yo-yo weight loss and your body is going to store fat instead of ensuring it's release!<br /><br />So, be sure to get plenty of protein to help in building lean muscle tissue... which will burn fat, complex carbs (fiber) which will help your digestive system (this boosts your metabolism), healthy fats (monounsaturated) to help with heart health but also to aide in the metabolization of body fat, and of course foods rich in vitamins and minerals (fruits and vegetables).<br /><br />See, I told you that you need ALL types of nutrients! That's why those "fad diets" do not work, and they will ultimately end up causing your metabolism to decrease!<br /><br />Alright, now the final thing that you want to do to make it possible to lose body fat, and a lot of weight as quickly as possible is to make sure that you increase your metabolic rate and prevent it from decreasing. Doing so will not only get you faster results... your results will also be permanent.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-8981548719966946108?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/jZKvx8x_ySA" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Would you like to <span style="font-weight: bold;">lose 25 pounds in 4 weeks</span> easily, quickly, and naturally? Okay, take just a few minutes out of your day today to read this article here and learn more about 3 incredibly easy tips to drop up to 25 lbs. of fat in 30 days... and keep it off FOR GOOD!<br /><br />1.) Eat These Foods: Foods rich in lean protein (chicken breast, turkey breast, almonds, egg whites), fiber (beans, wheat, whole grains), healthy fats (fish, nuts, olive oil), and foods rich in vitamins and minerals (fruits and veggies - I highly recommend you get a lot of green veggies due to their high fiber content).<br /><br />2.) Drink This Much Water: To properly flush out harmful toxins in your body, to help metabolize stubborn fat, to help in increasing the proper development of your muscle tissue (which burns off a ton of fat itself), I strongly recommend that you at least get 1/2 your body weight in ounces each day. For example, if you weight 200 pounds, you would get 100 ounces of fresh water daily. Now, if you are exercising a lot, I recommend that you increase your water consumption a little more to compensate for the water you'll lose (sweat).<br /><br />3.) SKYROCKET Your Metabolism: If you really want to ensure that you'll lose 25 pounds in 4 weeks, I strongly recommend that you boost your metabolism as high as possible. This is a surefire way to get not only get quicker fat loss, but once you lose the pounds of fat, it will stay off for good... unlike with unnatural methods such as with diet pills and fad diets.<br /><br /><a href="http://fatloss4idiots.fatlossin11days.info"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CLICK HERE</span></a> to lose 25 pounds in 30 days... and keep it off FOR GOOD!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-4318774575969999286?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/KeVmp1WrGA8" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Lose 6 Pounds in 1 Week With Ease - 4 Best Tips to Lose 6 lbs Of Fat Easily, Quickly &amp; Permanently!</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~3/uah5dRInAx0/lose-6-pounds-in-1-week-with-ease-4.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jun 2010 12:00:05 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to effectively <span style="font-weight: bold;">lose 6 pounds in 1 week</span>, the first "biggest secret" is consistency. Nothing is going to work unless you are 100% consistent. Alright, now that you know the "biggest secret" (lol) to weight loss, take a little time out of your busy day to read on and see the 4 best tips to lose 6 lbs. of fat fast, easy, and permanently.<br /><br />There are so many things being thrown at you each and every day on how to lose weight, build muscle, and/or burn fat fast. The problem is that there is so much false methods and information out here that many people just end up frustrated and end up with no results at all.<br /><br />The following is all that you need to know in order to get results:<br /><br />1.) Fad diets don't work. Your body needs complex carbs (fiber), so low carb diets don't work. Your body needs the right amount of calories to prevent it from going into "starvation mode" (a slow metabolism), so low calorie diets don't work. Your body needs healthy fats such as monounsaturated and Omega, so low fat diets don't work.<br /><br />2.) Proper nutrition. Be sure to get plenty of all the nutrients your body needs each day. Place more emphasis on protein and foods rich in vitamins and minerals (fruits and veggies) for best results.<br /><br />3.) Increase water. You've heard this before, and it's true... you need A LOT of water every day in order to be able to lose 6 pounds in 1 week. Water flushes out harmful toxins, and will help your body metabolize fat. I recommend for you to get 1/2 your body weight in ounces.<br /><br />4.) Respect your metabolism. Don't decrease your metabolism (see #1), and do the right things to naturally boost it. You can boost your metabolism by:<br /><br />  * Eating more frequently through out the day (4-5 meals).<br /><br />* High intensity workouts (sprinting, incline treadmill, H.I.I.T - high intensity interval training)<br /><br />* Adding spices to your foods (such as cayenne pepper)<br /><br />* Drinking plenty of "ice cold" water (increases thermogenesis where your body has to warm the cold water up to body temperature and will jump start the metabolism in order to do so).<br /><br />Now, if you really want to <a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lose 6 pounds in 1 week</span></a> and "melt away fat" LIGHTING fast, then I highly recommend the "Calorie Shifting Diet" from Fat Loss 4 Idiots since this diet program will SKYROCKET YOUR METABOLISM to the highest peak... consistently! I lost an AMAZING 50 lbs. of fat in 8 weeks using this online plan and I did not regain 1 pound back!<br /><br />Click <a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info/"><span style="font-weight: bold;">http://www.FatLossIn11Days.info</span></a> to read my full review, GET 50% OFF, and get started INSTANTLY!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-148180959302079843?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/uah5dRInAx0" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Effective Weight Loss - The 3 Most Effective Ways to Get Lightning Fast Weight Loss in 1 Month!</title>
      <link>http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~3/fKU2pMPfimA/effective-weight-loss-3-most-effective.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2010 12:00:04 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[To get effective weight loss, it all boils down to the following 3 most effective methods. Read on to learn what those methods are so that you can quickly get started on your quest to get fast results in just 1 month!<br /><br />1.) Eat Several Times Daily - Instead of eating the typical 3 large meals every day, change it up and eat 4-5 small healthy meals daily. The reason why is because this will cause a HUGE spike in your metabolism... which will lead to greater fat loss and weight loss... and it will stay off for good.<br /><br />If you are busy through out the day, I know that eating more frequently may be a bit of a challenge. What I recommend you do is start with breakfast (NEVER SKIP BREAKFAST), and eat a small healthy meal every 2-3 hours after. A small meal can be something as simple as a handful of almonds, a yogurt, and a piece of fruit. You can even have a nice size protein shake as one of your meals.<br /><br />2.) NEVER Restrict - Whatever you do, do not restrict calories, nutrients, or even cheat foods once in awhile. You shouldn't restrict calories severely because doing so will reduce your metabolism. You shouldn't restrict nutrients (carbs, fats, etc.) because your body actually needs ALL types of nutrients... just in moderation. And you shouldn't restrict having a cheat meal once in awhile as this will keep you from depriving... and it could also boost your metabolism!<br /><br />3.) Metabolism - A proven way to get unbelievably fast results is to make sure that you increase your metabolic rate as high as possible. Doing so will not only ensure that you'll lose pounds of fat fast... once you drop the weight and fat, and it will all stay off permanently!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-6456697591076153217?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/fKU2pMPfimA" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2010 12:00:01 GMT</pubDate>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Want to <span style="font-weight: bold;">lose love handles fast</span>, easy, and permanently. Alright, read on to learn more about what it would take to lose love handles starting right now!<br /><br />Okay, now the first thing you need to know is that you can not lose love handles "directly". You have to lose total body fat... and that of course is not actually a bad thing!<br /><br />Alright, love handles, back fat, belly fat, and thigh fat are some of the most stubborn areas of the body to lose fat from. Therefore, what you have to do is do things that will remove stubborn fat. Here are the top 3:<br /><br />1.) Drink A LOT Of Water: Drinking plenty of water daily (1/2 your body weight in ounces) will flush out nasty toxins that are keeping that stubborn fat on you. Also, water will help in properly developing muscle tissue. This is important because the more muscle tissue you have, the more your body will automatically burn fat.<br /><br />2.) Proper Nutrition: Get plenty of ALL nutrients because they ALL are important. Why do I keep stressing "ALL"? Well, those fad diets (low carb, low fat, low calorie, etc.) are based around restricting specific types of nutrients.<br /><br />This is a big NO-NO because restricting nutrients that your body is begging you for daily will cause your metabolism to decrease. Guess what happens with a slow metabolism? Yo-yo weight loss (you regain weight you've just lost) and RETAINED body fat (your body holds on to calories and fat because it is sensing starvation due to you restricting calories)!<br /><br />3.) Speaking Of #2 - If you want to lose love handles fast, focuses heavily on BOOSTING your metabolism! If you get your metabolism elevated naturally to the highest peak, you will most certainly get rid of that stubborn fat incredibly faster, easier, and it will be permanent.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info"><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">CLICK HERE</span></a> for a great diet for losing love handles fast.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-3449500413901080713?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/W9AhaNNSt30" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you want to permanently, easily, and naturally get a flat stomach fast, there are some things that DO NOT work, and there is one thing that will most certainly get you quick results. Read on to discover what works and what does not work to flatten you stomach lightning fast!<br /><br />What does not work?<br /><br />   * Focusing primarily on losing fat off the stomach and not the rest of your body. In order to flatten your belly, you have to remove fat from your entire body... which is of course a good thing, yes?<br />  <br />* Strictly using diet pills.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[To effectively <span style="font-weight: bold;">lose inches off your waist</span>, there are many things that you have to do in order to get success. However, if you do not place a lot of attention on a specific HUGE aspect to get the best results... then you're results are going to be minimum to none! Take a couple of minutes out of your day to read on and learn more.<br /><br />Okay, now the first thing we're going to talk about are the things that you SHOULD NOT do if you want to lose inches and pounds fast:<br /><br />  * Fad dieting - The low carb, low calorie, low fat, celebrity types of fad diets are ineffective, expensive, and in some cases... dangerous! The biggest consequence with those types of diets is the fact that they will slow down your metabolism. If this happens, your body will actually retain fat instead of burning it off and you can end up with "rebound weight loss" (you lose weight... then regain it all back!)<br /> <br />* Diet pills - Now, there are some diet pills that are safe and do work. HOWEVER, if you solely rely on diet pills to drop pounds and inches without making sure that you drink plenty of water, get proper nutrition, and exercise, they will end up also causing you "rebound weight loss"!<br /> <br />* Exercise - To get the best results, you have to do both cardiovascular AND resistance training in order to burn away fat effectively.<br /><br />Now, the single most effective way to get a slim waist in 3-4 weeks with ease is to naturally increase your metabolic rate.<br /><br />There are a few recommended ways to boost your metabolism:<br /><br />  * Eat frequently through out the day.<br />  * Do high intensity cardiovascular exercises (sprinting, incline treadmill).<br />  * Add spices to your meals.<br /><br />Now, if you really want to <a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Lose inches off your waistline</span></a> and "melt away fat" IN 3-4 WEEKS, then I highly recommend the "Calorie Shifting Diet" from Fat Loss 4 Idiots since this diet program will SKYROCKET YOUR METABOLISM to the highest peak... consistently! I lost an AMAZING 50 lbs. of fat in 8 weeks using this online plan and I did not regain 1 pound back!<br /><br />Click <a href="http://www.fatlossin11days.info"><span style="font-weight: bold;">http://www.FatLossIn11Days.info</span></a> to read my full review, GET 50% OFF, and get started INSTANTLY!<div class="blogger-post-footer"><hr/><a href="http://www.conquerweightloss.com">Health And Weight Loss Blog | conquerweightloss.com</a><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/7113338541075680020-6690927885268116281?l=www.conquerweightloss.com' alt='' /></div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ConquerWeightLoss/~4/YexXoipvKF0" height="1" width="1"/>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The first thing you need to do if you want to <b><a href="http://www.everyotherdaydiet.com/go/ajbarnes" rel="nofollow">get a thin waist fas</a></b>t is to make sure that with whatever it is you do, STAY CONSISTENT! The next thing I recommend for you to do is to follow my top 5 tips for losing inches off your waistline fast and easy!
<br />
<br />1.) Proper Nutrition - Eat 4-5 small healthy meals each day. Make sure that each of these meals contain ALL nutrients (protein, complex carbs such as fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals). Restricting nutrients and/or calories will only slow down your metabolism... so stay away from "fad dieting" also!
<br />
<br />2.) Exercise - Be sure to do both aerobic and resistance training to yield the best results. One tip I would like to add to this one is to lose inches quicker off your waist, I highly recommend for you to do leg raises for direct exercising on the waist and the incline treadmill for indirect exercising.
<br />
<br />3.) Water - Drink 1/2 your body weight in ounces every day. Water is absolutely essential for properly metabolizing fat and of course for many other health concerns.
<br />
<br />4.) Sleep - Aim to get 7-8 hours of rest each and every night. Doing so will ensure that your body will be able to properly get rid of fat waste while you sleep. Did you know that your body can burn up to 500 calories while you sleep?! That's right! So, make sure you start getting more sleep!
<br />
<br />5.) Metabolic Rate - The way to guarantee that you'll get a thin waist fast is to make sure that you naturally increase your metabolic rate to the maximum peak. Doing so will not only cause pounds of fat to quickly melt off, but it will also ensure that you will not REGAIN pounds back... unlike with fad diets and diet pills!<div>
