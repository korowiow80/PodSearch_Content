      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">If you focus on strengthening your thighs without worrying about shaping and toning them, you&#8217;ll have a much better shot at not only gaining functional strength, but also slimming our thighs. While it&#8217;s alright to make getting slimmer more sexy thighs a goal of yours, I&#8217;ve noticed that clients who focus on thing one small step at a time usually have the most success in ultimately reaching their goals.  The first place i like to have people place the focus in strengthening their things so that they are able to progress into the intense free weight based thigh workouts that are required to help you build a sexier lower body.<small><a title="summersgood" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/46212665@N03/4993775345/" target="_blank"></a></small></p>

The best way to start <a href="http://www.slimthighsexercises.com/thinthighsprogram">strengthening thighs</a> is to focus on performing barbell squats with as much weight as you can comfortably handle while still maintaining good weightlifting form.  There is no thigh exercise more effective than squats and focusing your efforts here will definitely allow you to strengthen and shape your thighs quickly. Most women completely ignore any form of progressive weight training fearing that it&#8217;s going to make their legs bigger and bulkier. Here&#8217;s the deal whit that&#8230;sure your leg muscles may get a bit bigger and initially your thighs may also get a bit bigger, but after a few weeks of dedicated effort and a solid nutrition plan, you&#8217;re going to start to strip of body fat &#8211; on your thighs, butt and really all over your body.  Once this happens, your legs will have sexier shape than they did before and ultimately they will be slimmer than when you started your thigh strengthening program.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s where I have my clients who are just beginning their sling thighs workouts start in order to strengthen their thighs&#8230;.</p>
<p>Warm Up</p>
<ul>
<li>Jog &#8211; Moderate intensity 10 minutes</li>
<li>Full body stretch</li>
</ul>
<p>Thigh Strengthening Workout</p>
<ul>
<li>Barbell Squat &#8211; 3 sets of 10 reps (with weight that you can still maintain good form with)</li>
<li>Rest for 2 minutes between sets</li>
</ul>
<p>Perform this thigh strengthening workout only 1 time each week so that your thighs have a chance to rest and recover properly. The next time you hit the gym for your thigh strengthening workout, bump up the weight a bit.  That&#8217;s the key to building up a decent base of strength &#8211; progressively increasing the weight that you train with at each and every workout.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s a pretty solid plan to start strengthening your thighs. Read through this post again and then get to the gym to build a solid base of thigh strength form which to work from today! If you do this I guarantee that you&#8217;ll have a much better chance of slimming your thighs quicker than you otherwise would.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Home thigh exercise routines are a hot topic these days (at least based on the number of emails I’ve been receiving on the subject lately).  When it comes to exercising to slim your thighs at home, it can be a serious challenge just mustering up enough energy to even begin your workout.  Let alone finding the resolve to figure out exactly which of the thigh exercises you can actually perform in your home.</p>
<p>In order to help, I’ve put together a quick thigh exercise routine that you can easily perform in the comfort of your own home without any fancy equipment, bogus fat burning supplements or fad diets involved.  The exercises that make up this home slim thighs workout target all the problem areas of your thighs with laser precision.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<a title="me and yoga, we're cool like that" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/62453281@N00/4302049708/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4302049708_30624cf584_m.jpg" border="0" alt="me and yoga, we're cool like that" /></a><small> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a title="sergeant killjoy" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/62453281@N00/4302049708/" target="_blank">sergeant killjoy</a></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If you commit to running through this 20 minute home thigh exercise routine 2 days a week, you’ll definitely be able to see and feel the difference in the size and shape of your thighs.  In fact, this is the exact same home thigh workout that I give to many of my clients who have limited time and resources to work with – but who still really want to get slim sexy thighs.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple and effective home thigh exercise routine that you can perform in any room of your home in under 20 minutes. This is an example of a “circuit” thigh workout which really just means that you will perform 1 set of each of the slim thighs exercises without any rest.  After you complete a “slim thighs circuit set” you will rest for anywhere from 1 – 2 minutes (it really just depends on your level of strength and conditioning).</p>
<p>The Home Thigh Exercise Warm-Up:  5 minutes of walking or jogging in place at a brisk pace. After you complete your warm up take the time to run through a few thigh stretches in order to loosen your muscles and get them ready for the workout!</p>
<p>The Home Thigh Exercise Circuit Routine…</p>
<p>Body-weight Squat: 1 set of 20 repetitions<br />
Stationary Lunges: 1 set of 20 repetitions (each leg)<br />
Single Leg RDL: 1 set of 20 repetitions (each leg)<br />
Side Lunges: 1 set of 20 repetitions (each leg)</p>
<p>Perform each slim thighs circuit set 3 times making sure to rest for 1 – 2 minutes between sets.  As your level thigh strength and conditioning increases feel free to add on more circuit sets to this home thigh exercise routine.</p>
<p>Many of my clients have slimmed their thighs and made a major impact on both the shape and tone of their thigh muscles by performing this quick home thigh exercise routine anywhere from 2 – 4 times each week. But before you get over excited and push the limit of your body make sure to allow for at least 1 full days rest in between this home slim thighs circuit workout.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Made with Parkour and Tennis" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39802787@N00/3303934531/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3368/3303934531_ddaac200a1_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Made with Parkour and Tennis" /></a><small><a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a title="Marco Gomes" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39802787@N00/3303934531/" target="_blank">Marco Gomes</a></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Most women think that in order to tone their thighs, they need to do a lot of aerobic exercise.  While aerobic exercise is great for lowering overall body fat levels, when performed as the only form of exercise, cardio is relatively ineffective for slimming thighs and firming buns.</p>
<p>If you want to turbo charge you progress towards a firmer sexier lower body, then you absolutely must perform regular strength training workouts that are based around free weight exercises.</p>
<p>Here are a few of the most effective free weight based thin thighs exercises&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Thigh Squats</li>
<li>DB Lunges</li>
<li>Barbell Lunges</li>
<li>DB Step ups</li>
<li>Leg Press</li>
<li>Leg Extension</li>
<li>Leg Curls</li>
<li>Dead Lift</li>
<li>St. Leg Deadlift</li>
</ul>
<p>Most women think that their legs will balloon up to pro bodybuilder proportions if they incorporate weight training into their fitness mix.  This simply is not true!  What I find happens to most of my clients when I introduce them to free weight based thin thighs exercises, is that their thighs almost immediately begin to tone up and slim down ( within 1 -2 weeks).</p>
<p>While their thighs definitely become more muscular and athletic looking, they don&#8217;t become big and bulky like most women think they will.  In fact, after a few weeks of weight training the body fat begins to melt away, leaving a slimmer and firmer body everywhere &#8211; from the back of their arms to their thighs!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adding a few thigh stretches to your flexibility routine is a great idea because of the fact that the muscles that make up your thighs, hips and butt are some of the biggest muscle groups in your entire body.  When people begin to stretch the muscle sin their lower body on a regular basis, they often times notice an immediate improvement in everyday activities like walking and jogging.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Wunder Groove Crop, Dancer's Pose" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30011527@N05/4266107177/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2709/4266107177_c812a2a2dd_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Wunder Groove Crop, Dancer's Pose" /></a><small><a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a title="lululemon athletica" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/30011527@N05/4266107177/" target="_blank">lululemon athletica</a></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because the muscles in your thighs are in use so often for day to day activities, regular thigh stretches will have an impact on how your body moves. When performed regularly thigh stretches, just like any other form of flexibility exercise will help you&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve your thighs and hips range of motion.</li>
<li>Decrease You chances of incurring a hip or thigh muscle injury</li>
<li>Decrease your chances of incurring a joint or ligament injury to your hips or thighs</li>
<li>Decrease stiffness and pian in your thihgs and hips</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>A Few Popular Thigh Stretches&#8230;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Standing Quadriceps Stretch</strong></p>
<p>In order to perform the standing quadriceps stretch:</p>
<p>Grasp the top of your foot with your hand as you lift your foot towards the back of your body.</p>
<p>2.) gently lift your foot towards your body as you begin to feel your quadriceps muscles stretch.</p>
<p>3.) Hold the stretch for a count of 5 &#8211; 10 seconds, then release your leg and perform this stretch with your opposite leg.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800000;">*Do not stretch to the point of major muscle discomfort or pain -this can lead to a muscle or joint injury.<br />
</span><br />
<strong>Seated Quad Stretch</strong></p>
<p>In order to preform he seated quad stretch&#8230;</p>
<p>1.) Sit on the floor with your legs straight in front of you.</p>
<p>2.) Tuck one of your legs back so that you are sitting on it. The top of your foot should be in contact with the floor.</p>
<p>3.) Gently lean back and allow your quadriceps muscle to stretch to a comfortable position.  Hold the stretch for a 5 &#8211; 10 seconds. repeat with the opposite leg.</p>
<p>These are two of the most common thigh stretches for loosening up the muscles of your thighs.  At a minimum, I would recommend performing these stretches after a 5 -1 0 minute cardio warm up prior to training your legs.  This simple routine will go a  long way to prevent any type of unnecessary muscular injury.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">One of the first things that you need to take into account to thin your thighs is your nutrition plan.  While most women (and men for that matter) resort to a haphazard unorganized style of eating, it&#8217;s important to realize that a clean and healthy diet will account for up to 80% of your fat loss / weight loss / thigh slimming goals. Listed below are three thigh slimming nutrition tips to help you get moving towards your slim thighs goals today!</p>
<p>1.) Focus on eating 5 -6 smaller meals throughout the day.  Instead of focusing on eating only 2 or 3 big meals each day, give your metabolism a major boost by tapping into the &#8220;thermic effect of food&#8221;.  By eating smaller more frequent meals throughout the day, your body will begin to expend more energy just digesting the nutrients.  This gives you an advantage when it comes to slimming your thighs.</p>
<p>2.) Eat more fiber.  Fiber is a proven weight loss food and it&#8217;s healthy for you!  The recommended daily allowance of fiber is    for average women.  Most women don&#8217;t even come close to eating this quantity of fat melting fiber. Start out by making it a point to eat the recommended daily allowance for a few weeks , then try to eat a bit more. This will help you firm your buns at record pace!</p>
<p>Although it&#8217;s not highly publicized, fiber is one of the key points of emphasis for the contestants in T.V.&#8217;s Biggest Loser.</p>
<p>3.)  Drink plenty of water.  When you are trying to tone your thighs and slim your lower body, water can be one of your best friends! When you body is properly hydrated, not only will it run more efficiently, but your body will retain less water.  This will help you get that muscular toned look in your thighs and buns.  Regardless of how much fat you&#8217;re able to lose, if you&#8217;re retaining a lot of water, then your legs will look mushy and soft!</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s pretty much how to thin thighs and firm your lower body by implementing a few basic nutrition tips.  Simple and easy &#8211; yet very effective for achieving the toned athletic thighs that most women would die for!  Make it a habit to incorporate each of these thigh slimming nutrition tips into your daily nutrition plan and watch as your thighs start to slim.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to getting thin hips and a firm lower body, you will need to focus on lowering your overall body fat percentage by training the muscles of your entire body.  Sure thigh workouts that focus on the muscles of your legs, butt and hips need to be part of your fitness mix, but focusing exclusively on one muscle group does not lead to quicker fat loss results in that area.</p>
<p>This common misconception is known as spot reduction. It is impossible to make your body shed fat in one particular area by performing only exercises that target that area.  Whenever you thin your thighs, hips and buns, you will also notice a corresponding reduction in fat all over your body.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Walkin' Waikiki" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32912172@N00/3627830892/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none;" title="Thigh Workouts For Effective Fat loss" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3414/3627830892_6e5523ef02_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Walkin' Waikiki" width="180" height="240" /></a><small> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a title="bobster855" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/32912172@N00/3627830892/" target="_blank">bobster855</a></small></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When it comes to fat loss, the main objective of your thigh workouts is to aid in creating a fat burning calorie deficit.  By performing well rounded thigh workouts as well as upper body workouts, ab workouts and cardio sessions, your body is burning more calories.  This allows your body to start getting rid of extra energy in the form of fat.</p>
<p>When it comes to creating a moderate calorie deficit on a regular basis, it&#8217;s important to a find the right combination of fat burning workouts for your lifestyle.  While you may achieve quicker initial fat loss results by digging into one specific style of training, the best long term approach is to find a few different activities that you can alternate between each week.</p>
<p>By focusing on whole body workouts rather than simply isolating your thihgs, hips and buns, you up the ante a bit and cause your body to burn significantly more claories that it would during most typical thigh workouts.</p>
<p>If you are looking to slim your hips quickly, then there is no quicker route than combining free weight based strength training with regular aerobic exercise. This potent fat burning combination allows your body to build lean muscle mass while focusing on shedding flabby body fat.</p>
<p>When you increase the amount of lean muscle mass that your body carries, you inversly affect the amount of body fat that you can carry. In essence More muscle = less fat! If you take note of this relationship and you realize that adding a few pounds of muscle mass will not turn you into a pro bodybuilder, then you will be able to tap into some of the most effective fat burning thigh workouts!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re looking for thin hips and sexy thighs and firm buns, then absolutely have to make daily exercise a regular habit.  With fad diets and infomercials promising quick fix solutions for weight loss and flabby thighs, it can be hard to figure out exactly what works when it comes to shaping your lower body.</p>
<p>While gimmicks do work for some women, chances are the results fade quickly after only a few weeks of initial success.  <a href="http://www.slimthighsexercises.com/buttmakeover">The truth about getting thin hips and firm buns</a> is that you have to put in some hard work in order to get a sexy lower body.  While it would be great if you could just think about how much you wanted to thin your thighs and hips and watch it happen before your very eyes, it&#8217;s just not realistic to believe that this can happen.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: medium;">Get Thin Hips With Daily Exercise </span></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Its so soft..." href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23118985@N03/3597163044/" target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter" style="border: 0pt none;" title="Sexy Thin Hips!" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3603/3597163044_a749f223b4_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Its so soft..." width="195" height="240" /></a><small><a title="Attribution-NoDerivs License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/" target="_blank"><img src="http://173.192.120.91/~nicka241/slimthighsexercises.com/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" border="0" alt="Creative Commons License" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a title="chrisbastian44" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/23118985@N03/3597163044/" target="_blank">chrisbastian44</a></small></p>
<p>When it comes to slimming your thighs, firming your buns and achieving thin hips, there is no greater ally than a simple daily exercise session. Sure you can find programs that are based around fad diets, but long lasting weight loss results stem from regular exercise combined with a nutritious balanced diet.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Here&#8217;s How The Fat Loss Process Really Works&#8230; </strong></span></p>
<p>In order to burn fat, firm your lower body and thin your hips, you will need to focus on creating a calorie deficit that is somewhere in the ballpark of 3000 &#8211; 4000 calories each week.  This will translate into an approximate fat weight loss of 1lb. If you would like to shed 2lbs a week, then you will need to create a calorie deficit that is double that value (approx. 6000 &#8211; 8000 calories per week).</p>
<p>A calorie deficit is simply putting your body into a position to expend more energy than you take in each day. There are a few ways to accomplish this goal, but the best approach is to combine daily exercise with a well balanced and nutritious diet.  If you focus on performing some type of exercise for 20 &#8211; 40 minutes each day, then you will be going a long way towards creating an energy deficit without even altering what you eat!</p>
<p>If you combine your daily exercise session with a simple calorie reduction of 250 calories per day, then you will be on track to lose 1 lbs of fat each week.   This simple lifestyle change will definitely allow you to get sexy thin hips and firm thighs quickly, easily and naturally!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thigh squats are one of the most effective exercises that you can do in order to slim your thighs and firm up your lower body.  While squats are traditionally thought of as a basic leg exercise, most people don&#8217;t know that in addition to the thighs, squats also work the muscles in your butt as well as every other muscle in your lower body.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: large;">Why You Should Perform Thigh Squats</span></h2>
<p>If you are looking to slim your thighs quickly and efficiently, then you must perform squats. There are a few reasons why this is such an effective exercise for lower body fat and toning your thighs and buns, so I&#8217;ll highlight a few of them below&#8230;</p>
<p>1.) The muscles in your thighs, hips, butt and calves are some of the biggest muscles in your entire body. Because of their size, these muscles are also stronger than the other muscles in your body. When you  perform a free weight exercise like thigh squats, you are requiring the biggest and strongest muscles in your body to work very hard &#8211; this type of activity burn  a lot of calories!</p>
<p>AS you know, in order to burn body fat, you need to expend (burn) more calories than you take in on a regular basis. Squats when performed as a regular addition to your slim thighs workouts can contribute quite a bit towards creating the all important calorie deficit.</p>
<p>2.) Not only do thigh squats require an enormous amount of energy to perform, but they also target all of the muscles in your lower body.  Since your goal is to slim your thighs quickly, easily and naturally, doesn&#8217;t it just make good sense to try and get the biggest bang for your buck with each and every workout?</p>
<p>3.) Weight bearing exercises like thigh squats have been shown to increase the density of your bones.  If you combine regular weight bearing exercises with a calcium supplement, then you can really go a long way to ensure that your bones stay in good health for the rest of your life!</p>
<p>So not only do squats allow you to shape your thighs, hips and buns while also burning fat, but they also allow you to reduce your risk of developing osteoporosis later in life!  This alone should be enough reason to incorporate thigh squats into your fitness mix right away!</p>
