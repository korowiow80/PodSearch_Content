      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You must be very happy after the construction of your storage shed. It must be really good based on the right <strong><a href="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/recommend/" target="_blank">garden storage shed plans</a></strong> you have chosen. All the items are ready to go inside. Absolutely, it feels great to see that finally, every tool and stuff have its own neat place in the shed. The next thing you need to learn is how to protect your investment so that it can serve you for many years. <strong>Garden shed plans</strong> are really very helpful in making projects successfully, but without proper maintenance, anything you build will tear and wear sooner than you have expected.</p>
<p>Let the following measures for storage shed maintenance be your guide.</p>
<p><strong>Paint Your Shed</strong></p>
<p>Before you put anything in your storage shed; be sure to paint it to protect and give it a nice look. Paint is good on wood (and other materials used on sheds as well) as shield against environmental elements that can cause damage. You can try to use good quality paint to avoid repainting often so that you can save time and money. Varnish is ideal on wood to keep the charm that wood provides in any surrounding.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Take Care of the Roof</strong></p>
<p>Check the roof regularly for loose shingles and signs of leak because leaks may damage the precious things you keep inside and the wood itself when left for a long time. Take all dirt, dry leaves and twigs out from the roof as they will cause corrosion and rust if not removed. It doesn’t matter how you do the repair. For some, the easiest way is to replace loose or lost shingles, and then apply some quality roof coating to finish the job.</p>
<p><strong>Check the different Hardware</strong></p>
<p>It’s normal to see loose hardware like nails, bolts and screws. After a month or so, some kinds of wood would relax and make some tightly fastened hardware loose. You can drive the nails back and retighten the screws in place or replace them with new ones. Check the door fasteners, hinges, bolts and screws often to prevent the door from sagging. You can use grease or oil to prevent fasteners and hinges from rust.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Pests Away</strong></p>
<p>The most common pest that can invade your beautiful storage shed is the termites. They can quickly make your wooden shed their home and cause irreparable damage to the wood before you even know it. Discard pieces wood and dead plants out of your yard because these are favorite food for termites. They will surely find their way to your storage shed when eating these materials. Use termite resistant materials in making a ramp for your shed like pressure treated wood or steel. Rats are also frequent visitors in isolated  rooms like storage sheds. Treat them with the right rat pesticides.</p>
<p>It’s not enough that you have found the best <strong>garden storage shed plans</strong> that meet your taste and build a beautiful shed that you can be proud off. You can work on wood and build your shed in less time and cost, but you also have to learn the appropriate methods of maintenance to make it stand the test of time. Of course, you don’t have to go far when you have found your <strong>garden shed plans</strong> from My Shed Plans; you’ll find tips for maintenance too.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether your garden is large, medium or small, a garden storage shed is a necessity because it can house more than your gardening tools. However, choosing the right <strong><a href="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/recommend/" target="_blank">garden storage shed plans</a></strong> and design that looks good with your house and the rest of your yard is very important. A wooden storage shed is a perfect option when it comes to value, appeal and durability.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a target="_blank"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-116" title="WOOD-5-horz" src="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WOOD-5-horz.jpg" alt="" width="1060" height="303" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Wooden Storage Sheds</strong></p>
<p><strong>6 Outstanding Advantages of Wooden Storage Sheds</strong></p>
<p>1. Using wood for storage sheds encourages eco-friendliness. People who want to help save mother earth use wood because it is a renewable material. Many nations around the world have laws that require a replacement tree for every tree that gets cut.</p>
<p>2. Wood is cheap and durable to stand all kinds of weather elements including sun, rain, wind and snow. There are paints or stains that protect wood surface from damp weather to make it last.</p>
<p>3. Wood sheds are easy to modify. You can add more shelves using simple carpenter tools if you need more space to stack-up boxes and other items that you don’t use very often in the house.</p>
<p>4. Wooden garden sheds can add value to your property. You can customize the look and make it appear as a little version of your house to create a designer look.</p>
<p>5. Wood blends in with any garden environment because of its natural color. A beautifully designed wooden shed can serve not only as storage but also as a place to spend time leisurely, make new plans for the future, work on your hobby or as a playhouse for children.</p>
<p>6. Slabs of wood can be found anywhere in your neighborhood or local factories if you are resourceful enough. There are dismantled wooden structures just waiting for someone to bargain. All you need is to get a <strong>garden shed plan</strong> and follow the procedure from there. That is only – if you want to save more money. If your budget allows it, maybe you would desire to buy first hand materials, of course.</p>
<p>Outdoor <strong>garden shed plans</strong> are available for making sheds out of different materials such as vinyl, plastic and metal; but most people prefer sheds made from wood particularly the western red cedar wood. Cedar is plainly beautiful and it has a very inviting smell. Other materials used in making sheds cannot offer the same benefits and flexibility like wood. They provide basically the space needed for storage but they don’t have the beauty, charm and versatility of wooden storage sheds.</p>
<p>You must look for some <strong>garden storage shed plans</strong> designed for woodwork before you start building your dream wooden shed. One of the best places where the best wood storage shed designs are found is My Shed Plans. Would you prefer a metal or plastic shed when all that you can smell inside is the gas of the lawnmower and the aroma from stored pesticides? It may be the last place you and your kids want to be.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You certainly have a compelling reason why you want to have a <strong><a href="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/recommend/ " target="_blank">garden storage shed plan</a></strong> to put up a storage shed. You need a shed to keep and protect your outdoor equipments, gardening tools and other items that you seldom use. You don’t have to shop around to check what sheds are on sale. Chances are; there is no unit that will meet your criteria. The good news! You can construct your own shed if you have the best tool needed. And that is a <strong>garden shed plan</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Example-Of-a-Shed-Plan-1.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="size-full wp-image-109 aligncenter" title="Example Of a Shed Plan - 1" src="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Example-Of-a-Shed-Plan-1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Example of a Storage Shed Plan</strong></p>
<p><strong>Installing Your Own Garden Storage Shed Can Be Rewarding</strong></p>
<p>From scratch, you can construct a beautiful garden shed even if you have no detailed experience in woodwork. All you have to do is follow the plans, diagrams and instructions in details to come up with a finished project. The amount of construction time will actually depend on how much time you put on it and the size of your shed. One thing sure; working on it using a <strong>garden shed plan</strong> can be easy, fun and rewarding.</p>
<p><strong>Choose and Install the Best Garden Storage Shed</strong></p>
<p>The best storage shed depends on its usefulness and suitability in your yard as a whole. The size is always one of the most important factors in choosing a storage shed. An extremely large shed doesn’t look good in a very small garden or yard or vise versa. A storage shed becomes more valuable today in the safe keeping of gardening machines, tools, fertilizers and more. It is also a safe place to store fuel and oil used to run equipment.</p>
<p>When you want to install a garden storage shed; then you absolutely need a <strong>garden shed plan</strong> to prevent unnecessary waste of time, effort and materials. A plan is the perfect tool to come up with a project according to your specifications. By choosing carefully, you can get a plan for a shed with a compartment to separate products such as petroleum and pesticides from the rest of the items in the shed to protect your kids from hazards when they go in the shed.</p>
<p><strong>A Beautiful Shed Is An Eye Catcher In A Garden</strong></p>
<p>Make it sure that your shed can create an impact to your beautiful garden while keeping your tools safe after being installed. Some people use it as a quiet place to think and simply rest there. It might only be a few feet away from your house but if your shed is constructed based on a professional <strong>garden storage shed plan</strong>, it can offer the peace and relaxation you need. And of course that unique feeling that the money you spent is worth it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even if your landscape is superb, it will look like a mess if all the tools and garden accessories are standing along the sides of your walls. You obviously need a storage shed to keep those things inside and prevent clutter around your garden. But how do you solve this issue? When you want to build a storage shed, how can you find the right <strong><a href="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/recommend/ " target="_blank">garden storage shed plans</a></strong> for your yard to start with?</p>
<p><strong>6 Pointers When Looking for Shed Plans</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Determine the type and size of the garden shed you need, and then the <strong>garden shed plan</strong> that will match your taste. To be able to do that you have to estimate the amount of stuff that you will store inside the shed.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Consider the area in your yard that the shed will occupy. It should be strategically located in a spot accessible when you work in the yard. It shouldn&#8217;t make you go around the house before you can put in and take out the things you need.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Check it out if there is a list of materials to buy and if there is a guide to follow in the construction of the shed, including diagrams of the different stages in the process.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Before any construction takes place, it requires a building permit. You have to determine first if your desired storage shed needs a permit.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Determine if you can afford time, effort and everything about building a storage shed from nothing but a diagram or plan at hand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Allow space for expansion. You may want to buy a lawn mower that you can ride on a few months from now. That will need a larger space in your garden storage shed as its new home.</li>
</ul>
<p>A beautiful garden shed can be a perfect hideaway not only for garden equipments, tools, lawn furniture or clutters from your home but also for kids at play, or for mom and dad’s hobbies. The reasons and needs for a shed are yours alone. Your dream garden shed is not far from reality if you can get the right <strong>garden shed plans</strong> that offer amazing finished projects.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself to be overwhelmed upon seeing hundreds of detailed <strong>garden shed plans</strong>. They come with attractive photos of finished structures that all of them will easily lure you without knowing that a shed might be too small of too large for your yard. You have to be practical when choosing a shed plan. You may not want to be carried away by beauty in pictures but by functionalities of the shed to serve its purpose.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tool Shed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: left;">It is very important to organize tools and similar items in a tool shed. It will eliminate clutter inside your home. Without a tool shed, you put you tools behind doors and anywhere around the house. Tool shed plans for different sizes and shapes are available to fit your needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Storage Shed</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>Storage shed can be small, medium, or large, depending on your needs and budget. It can be a simple and one story shed at any spot in your yard allocated for storage. It is where you can store items and hazardous products that you must not keep inside your homes like gasoline, chemicals and fertilizers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Garage Shed</span></p>
<p>It can be an all-purpose shed where you can do repairs and store car tools. You can keep equipments used in your lawn in the garage shed to protect them from weather damages. You can easily find the best <strong>garage shed plan</strong> for the shed that will look compatible with the style of your house and with the size and features that you are looking for.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yard Shed</span></p>
<p>A yard shed is usually a place for assorted items including garden tools, lawn equipments, old appliances and scraps, pieces of old furniture, and other things that you don’t need in the house any longer. You can let your dog stay in one corner of the yard shed so that you don’t have to buy a separate dog house.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Potting Shed</span></p>
<p>This is a nice setup for gardening purposes and it can be a great center of attraction in a garden. It’s very functional as shelter from direct sun and other kinds of weather when you are potting plants. You can put the bags of soil, fertilizer, small gardening tools and pots in there for easy access, but you may want to return these things to the bigger yard shed after potting.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Farm Shed</span></p>
<p>If you live in a farm, definitely you need a farm shed to store vehicles, farm equipments and smaller tools. It is important to keep them from the damaging effects of changing weather conditions. It is where you can house some livestock, hunting and fishing gadgets, car fuel and oil. The farm shed can serve as your workshop too.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Barn Storage Shed</span></p>
<p>A barn shed can be used for storage and as a workshop. It is good to keep farm equipments and to store grains. The old style barns have upper deck where grains and hays are stored to protect them from getting wet and save space below for other activities in the barn. Barn sheds are also ideal in the backyard or garden of any home.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no such thing as enough storage space even if your house is big especially when you keep buying new appliances and tools year after year. The need for more space reminds you to make a shed or look for some <strong><a href="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/recommend/" target="_blank">garden storage shed plans</a></strong> to build one in your yard. This is true if you have many items to store so that you don’t need to stack them on top of each other. Your topsy-turvy storage is very inconvenient when you need something that is piled under or in between objects in your garage, basement, or attic.</p>
<p>What you really need to do is browse the site of My Shed Plans. It will show you how to get access to a variety of <strong>garden shed plans</strong> to find a design with enough room to house your arsenal of power tools and other stuffs that you want to store away from the main house. You’ll be amazed with beautiful wooden storage shed ideas that you can build on your own even if it will be your first time to work on wood. Of course, you’ll need a little help from a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Make A Choice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can buy a wooden shed kit of any brand but remember that buying a kit will give you no other option but to accept the manufacturer’s design and materials.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Make your own garden shed plans and structure according to your desire. Constructing a shed from your own idea will take longer, will surely be more expensive and does not guaranty your expected result.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Build the garden shed you consider best by choosing from several garden shed plans. If you decide to use the book My Shed Plans, there is nothing to worry about. All necessary details are included, just build your shed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things to Consider When Building a Garden Shed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Time: How much time do you have for the construction? If your time is limited and you don’t have the love for woodwork, simply go to the nearest home supply depot. The shed can be delivered to your address and assembled in your yard. You don’t have to use your valuable time in the construction but you have to pay a little cost for it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Size: Is the garden storage shed mainly for housing the junks and tools that you use in the lawn or garden? It’s a good step to determine the stuffs you want to keep in the shed. The size of your storage must allow enough clearance around every item to make moving in and out easy, if you have large equipments, you may want a large sliding door.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Budget: The money you have allotted for a storage shed will determine the size and features of the project. You may want a small covered porch at the front or a plain unit with a front door and two tiny windows. The more features you want, the more expensive it will be.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wooden sheds are easier to build if they are made from <strong>garden storage shed plans</strong>. If you are confident enough to tackle shed construction from scratch, get your <strong><a href="http://gardenstorageshedplans.com/recommend/" target="_blank">garden shed plans online from My Shed Plans now!</a></strong></p>
