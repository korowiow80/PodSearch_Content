      <title>Lose Weight In A Week With Some Quick Tips</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Emma_Green"&gt;Emma Green&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Lose weight in a week? Is it even possible? Well actually yes. I mean, it's quite normal for people to lose a pound or two when they are trying to diet or whatever, but is it really possible to lose a significant amount of weight in a week? Read on to find out how to lose weight in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip 1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's definitely possible to lose weight in a week, the only catch is how much. Much of it depends on your body type, how much you weigh to begin with etc, but it should theoretically be possible for an overweight person to lose 5 or 6 lbs in a single week. Bear in mind that sex will come into play though, as men can lose weight faster than women, due to their increased muscle mass which means they can burn calories a little faster. It should still be possible for just about anyone to lose weight in a week though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set yourself a realistic goal. If you want to lose 22 lbs in 7 days to get into a dress for a party or whatever, you don't have much chance. I'm sure it could be done, but I'm not sure if you would still be living after! Monitor your weight over the whole time, and set yourself checkpoints along the way - If you want to lose 6lbs for example, you know you have to lose just under a lb a day. Also, doing this will stop any nasty surprises and help you adjust things on the way to hitting your big goal, and gives you more chance to lose weight in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find an exercise you like and get used to doing it. If you want to lose weight in a week, seriously lose weight, exercise is essential. Now I understand that there may not be an exercise you like, but try and think along the lines of something that you find the lesser evil. In order to lose any real weight inside a week, you'll need to be doing this exercise pretty much every day! Something that's high in activity is going to be best, jogging or cycling, and if you can only bring yourself to walk, you had better plan some long hikes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tip 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don't keep it a secret. If you admit to a friend or family member that you are trying to lose weight in a week, it's likely they won't believe you are going to do it. What better motivation for proving them wrong? Also do you want to have to face up to them and tell them that you failed? Things like that can be great motivators, and bear in mind, motivation is exactly what you need to get you really working out hard and watching your diet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to lose weight in a week, you can do a lot worse than follow the tips above. If you aren't accustomed to strenuous activity however, it's always recommended that you speak to your doctor before you start exercise programs.

      <title>Quick Weight Loss Tips - How to Lose Weight Fast</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Michelle_Spencer"&gt;Michelle Spencer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the way to easy and quick weight loss is to eat less and exercise more. But the hard part is knowing what to eat less of (and equally what to eat more of), amidst all the conflicting advice that we're bombarded with every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fats aren't as bad for us as doctors, dietitians and even the government would have us believe. And carbs aren't as "energy giving" as we're told either, so were do we start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand why we seem to be consuming more calories, we need to get back to basics and look at the three fundamental elements of our diet: carbohydrates, fats and proteins. We need to understand how they work together, whether we're in the process of getting fat or thin, and the role they play in our digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll start with protein, since the popularity of high-protein diets like the Atkins diet program has made it a hot topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protein is an essential part of your diet. In fact, you are already half protein: 50% of your dry body weight is made up of muscles, organs, skin and hair, all forms of protein. We need this element to build and repair body tissues, and it figures in nearly all metabolic reactions. So if you're embarking on a quick weight loss program, or perhaps already on one, don't forget to make sure you include plenty of protein rich foods in your diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protein is also a critical brain food, providing amino acids for the neurotransmitters that relay messages to the brain. The brain fog people experience on some diets is probably the result of diminished protein. This is also why it's not a good idea to skip breakfast on the morning of a big meeting or exam. Protein is literally food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main sources of dietary protein come from animals: meat, seafood, dairy and eggs. Vegetable sources include beans and soy-based products like tofu. Unfortunately, protein sources such as red meat and full-fat dairy products are also high in saturated fats which are harmful to your health, especially your heart. This is why there is so much concern in the medical field about the popularity of high-protein/low-carb diets like Atkins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is not so much with the high levels of protein, but with the saturated fats associated with these proteins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important that we get our protein from sources that are low in saturated fats, such as lean meats, skinless poultry, seafood, low-fat dairy products, tofu and other soy products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One exceptional source of protein is the humble bean. Beans are just about a perfect food - they're high in protein and fiber, and low in saturated fat. No wonder so many of the world's cuisines have found a myriad of wonderful ways to cook beans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to become more bean savvy. Nuts are another excellent source of protein that are relatively low in fat - as long as you don't eat a whole bowlful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of how you feel, protein is what leaves you feeling satisfied and well fed. Because it breaks down more slowly in your digestive system you feel fuller longer. This characteristic is key to the success of any quick weight loss program.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How to Lose Weight Fast Safely - No More Fad Diets!&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Allison_R"&gt;Allison R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'm sure you know that some diets and diet pills are dangerous. Do you want to find out how to lose weight fast safely? There is a plan that teaches you the steps of quick weight loss, and it is a very safe and healthy plan. If you are interested in a plan that helps you drop the pounds without starvation or calorie counting, keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people know that diet pills can be dangerous and have even caused death in some cases. Fad diets aren't healthy and can leave you depleted of vitamins and minerals, which can cause many health problems. In this article I will show you how to lose weight fast and do it safely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By eating a balanced diet that contains proteins, carbs and fats (yes, you can eat fats and still lose weight), you can train your body to burn calories fast. If you are one of the people who eat mostly processed foods and fast foods, try adding some of the foods below to increase metabolism. This will help you lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to Lose Weight Fast Safely&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are foods that should be added to your diet: Fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products, beans, whole grain cereals and breads, nuts and seeds. Also, spicy foods are good for fast weight loss because many contain cayenne pepper and garlic, which are great fat burning foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drinking your share of water and green tea will also help to increase metabolism, which will help your body burn fat and calories. Drink 6 or 8 glasses of water every day, and 1 or 2 glasses of green tea. Beware though, most green tea contains some caffeine so drink it earlier in the day to avoid sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat more often. Instead of eating three large meals, try eating 4 or 5 smaller meals throughout the day. Not only does this increase metabolism, it also cuts down on hunger between meals. This means less snacking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to lose weight fast safely? Follow the tips above and add in a little exercise. This doesn't have to be a chore. Simply doing some weight bearing exercise for 15 or 20 minutes three times per week will cause your body to burn fat for much longer than other exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an online diet plan that teaches you all the steps of a method called "calorie switching". This plan shows you how and what to eat, and how you can lose weight fast without ever counting a calorie, fat gram or carb. It has helped thousands of people with quick weight loss, and many lose 15 pounds in less than one month - without risking their health!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in learning how to lose weight fast safely, I suggest you take a look at this popular program. At a cost that is far less than the price of a weeks worth of diet foods on other programs, it is well worth your investment!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For an amazing plan that teaches you &lt;a target="_new" href="http://theskinnyonweightloss.blogspot.com/search/label/How%20to%20Lose%20Weight%20Quick"&gt;how to lose weight quick&lt;/a&gt; and in a safe way, I suggest you visit &lt;a target="_new" href="http://theskinnyonweightloss.blogspot.com"&gt;The Skinny on Weight Loss&lt;/a&gt; for information on Fat Loss 4 Idiots, the most popular quick weight loss plan ever!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the Quickest Way to Lose Weight - Another Diet Breakdown</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the Quickest Way to Lose Weight - A Diet Breakdown&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Jonathan_Drake"&gt;Jonathan Drake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second question people often ask when looking to lose weight is "what IS the best way to lose weight", the first is "what is the QUICKEST way to lose weight" We've all been there, it's no fun to be walking around carrying more pounds on us than we probably should. While balanced and healthy diet combined with exercise is always the best and safest approach for you bodies overall health, the fact still remains that losing weight quickly is important to people. And so for that reason I am providing you with a quick breakdown of some of the top dieting approaches, how they work, and what you need to know if you are looking to lose weight quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Low Carb Diets. Low carb diets can be one of the quickest ways to lose weight. I once lost 25 pounds in a mere 5 weeks with a low carb diet and I was not very heavy to begin with. The low carb diet is based around the idea that if you cut out carbohydrates - your bodies primary source of energy - that once deprived, your metabolism will flip from a carb burning metabolism to a fat burning metabolism. While low carb diets do certainly work, they are also the source of much controversy because the diets typically consist of unusually high amounts of meat and cheese, which raises certain questions about the diets heart healthiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Macrobiotic Diets. Macrobiotic diets are basically dietary regiments consisting largely of natural and staple foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables with the emphasis being on avoiding all processed foods. The macrobiotic diet is a very healthy and beneficial long term diet. While I highly recommend it for anyone seeking a healthier life, it is not necessary the quickest way to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. The Hollywood Diet. The Hollywood diet is a dietary regiment that basically involves drinking nothing but a supposed miracle juice over a 48 hour period. The claim is that you can lose as much as 10 pounds in that short amount of time. I have tried the Hollywood diet and it is true that it is a very quick way to lose weight, however, unfortunately the only significant weight you are losing is water weight. It would be physiologically impossible to lose anywhere near that amount of fat in such a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is one &lt;a target="_new" href="http://myfatlossformula.info"&gt;Diet&lt;/a&gt; that I didn't mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a target="_new" href="http://MyFatLossFormula.Info"&gt;http://MyFatLossFormula.Info&lt;/a&gt; to find out which one. It really works!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is The Quickest Way To Lose Weight Easily?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=John_J_Thompson"&gt;John J Thompson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So you asked yourself what is the quickest way to lose weight? Well your not alone because millions of people have asked that question for many decades. I am about to show you some of the quickest ways to lose weight and actually keep it off. Lets go ahead and get this started shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best way to lose weight is to actually eat a bit more. I am talking about eating several small meals throughout the day to boast your metabolism. This can be quite effective compared to eating nothing all day or eating a lot all day. Theres a fine line between too much and too little, both are actually bad for you. You most likely did not know that eating nothing is almost as bad as eating too much did you for weight loss?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people do not know this and it comes as a surprise. Actually what is now known as calorie shifting is actually a bit new. It involves eating several small meals throughout the day to raise your metabolism and burn more fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so when asking yourself "what is the quickest way to lose weight?" you need to think outside of the box a little. When you starve yourself your actually going to gain a lot of weight eventually and even more in the future. Ok so I will admit if you truly starve yourself you will start to see weight loss, but you will appear unhealthy and the weight will come back double once you start eating again. You are setting yourself up for a trap if you take this route. Try to balance your diet with 4-6 small three calorie meals throughout the day. This works wonders for most people. Now maybe your not asking yourself what is the quickest way to lose weight over and over in your head right? If you still need more help check out my bio box below, I wish you good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Are The Quickest Ways To Lose Weight?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=John_Whelan"&gt;John Whelan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you want to lose weight there is nothing stopping you, but what are the quickest ways to lose weight? Surgery is dangerous and expensive while diet pills are unpredictable since every human on earth has different genetics &amp; metabolism levels. With so much controversy on weight loss techniques we will stick to the safe, natural methods in this article and discuss the quickest ways to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing to do is stop eating refined sugars and anything touched by man! If it's packaged and processed by human hands stay away.  Let's do an example with Breakfast Cereal, stay away from high amounts of salt &amp; sugar including grams of fat. If you don't know what the chemical ingredients are, put it back on the shelf and grab some Shredded Wheat [only has one ingredient: Whole Wheat!]. Top your cereal with Skim Milk &amp; Strawberries followed by a tablespoon of Natural Peanut Butter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above meal consists of Protein [skim milk] Carbohydrates [whole wheat] and healthy fat [natural peanut butter]. Think of these food groups as you plan your 5 to 6 meals a day, [the standard if you're serious about losing weight]. A regular dose of proper nutrition, cardio and resistance training will blast off the fat sooner than you think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protein burns fat! The human body takes 3 hours to digest each meal, lean protein is very thermogenic and burns calories better than any other nutrient. Just think, a meal every 3 hours, you'll never go hungry again and get ravenous cravings for cheesburgers and fries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat Fresh fish like Salmon, Herring &amp; Rainbow Trout. If you don't have these available then go for Chicken &amp; Turkey Breast, Tuna, Shellfish, Egg Whites, non-fat cottage cheese and Whey Protein[as a back-up].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the Complex Carbohydrates you'll need as energy for your intense workouts: Spinach, Kale, Broccoli, Brussel  Sprouts, Asparagus, Collard Greens, Red Peppers, Tomatoes, Yams &amp; Sweet Potatoes, Barley, Oatmeal [no sugar!], Beans, Lentils and long grain basmati rice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good Fats your body requires with Omega 3 Fatty Acids.&lt;br&gt;
Flaxseed Oil, Udo's Choice Essential Oil, Fish Fat [salmon, trout, herring, sardines] These are the best nutrients in all three categories and should be combined approximately 40% protein 40% carbohydrates and 20% fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, stay away from any kind of sugar and fast food!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink 8-10 glasses of water a day, flush those ugly toxins out of your sacred vessel!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the gym and find a trainer to start you on a weight lifting routine suited for your level and go 3 to 4 times a week. If you can't do the gym and want to workout at home, find a recommended resource in print or on DVD. Working out at home takes more discipline but it adds to the challenge! Go For It! Run, walk, ride a bike or get on a stairmaster, normally 3 to 4 times a week for a minimum of one half hour. The human body was meant to work and move, turn off the television and work that body!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set a goal to lose your weight within the time you want it to happen, write it down and put it on the fridge, in your wallet, on the bathroom mirror and believe it's going to happen!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write down your goals like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I Will lose [blank] pounds in [blank] days/weeks/months! I WILL not make any excuses or be discouraged by negative comments!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For inspiration, find a photo out of a fitness, fashion or movie magazine of someone you want to look like and attach it where you'll see it everyday. These are the quickest ways to lose weight and most importantly the safest since you won't be starving yourself, less food does not equal more weight loss. This is a major misconception among a lot of people. The human body has a very precise survival instinct, if it detects you are in starvation mode [like skipping regular meals] it will store fat more readily and slow down your metabolism!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food For Thought!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quickest Way to Lose Weight For Women - Just Give Me 5 Minutes of Your Time a Day</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Jennifer_Jolan"&gt;Jennifer Jolan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Here's the quickest way to lose weight for women. In fact, it only takes 5 MINUTES of your time each day. For that 5 minutes, you can expect pounds and inches of &lt;em&gt;FAT to DRIP OFF&lt;/em&gt; your butt, thighs, hips, and belly within 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'll even add in a bonus tip that takes a &lt;em&gt;WHOPPING 15 SECONDS&lt;/em&gt; of your time that you can do anywhere and at anytime which will help boost your weight loss efforts as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quickest Way to Lose Weight For Women&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hindu Squats... an unbelievably fast way to lose weight. It's a type of fast squat without weights. First, set your feet around 18 inches apart. Then start squatting as fast as you can. Start out by trying to do 50 repetitions in under 3 minutes and build up to 100 in 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you stick with the 5 minute version for 2 weeks... and do them each day, you'll notice your &lt;em&gt;body is changing&lt;/em&gt;. You can't help but see that in the mirror... and &lt;u&gt;feel how loose your clothes are on you&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, before I forget, I want you to touch your finger tips to the floor during each rep to demonstrate you went down far enough in the squat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bonus Tip&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt;: This isn't a pure cardio/aerobic tip, but you can use it anytime... including while you do cardio. It &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enhances &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;weight loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;effect&lt;/strong&gt; of any cardio you do. What is this tip? It's deep breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's how to do it to get the most out of it during cardio (but remember, you can do it even when doing nothing... like watching tv and still help with weight loss). You inhale for 5, hold for 5, and exhale for 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In simplest terms, the extra oxygen oxidates and helps to burn off extra body fat. So do that &lt;u&gt;&lt;em&gt;15 second technique&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/u&gt; every once in awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you go. If you want the quickest way to lose weight, then all you need to do are Hindu Squats for 5 minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Is the "quickest way to lose weight" enough for you... or do you want more TOP SECRET weight loss TACTICS?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>One of the Quickest Ways to Lose Weight</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quickest Way to Lose Fat&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Hyder_Khan"&gt;Hyder Khan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The quickest way to burn fat is to follow a fad diet program that promises rapid weight loss results in the shortest time period possible. The calorie shifting diet is one such example of a diet that can help you reach your goal. If followed properly, this diet claims that you will lose weight at the rate of about 9 pounds every 11 days, or about 18 to 20 pounds in one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most rapid weight loss diets are unsustainable for the long-term and simply unsafe to follow for more than two weeks at a time. The calorie-shifting diet falls into the same category but its diet plan is unique in that it requires you to take a mandatory 3-day break from the diet after the 11th day. So, in a 14-day period, you are only following the diet for 11 days. After the 3-day break, you can then safely jump right back onto the diet again, for another 11 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way the calorie shifting diet works is simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You do not need to count calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You can eat as much food as you like at every meal until you are satisfied but not full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• You must eat 4 full meals a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;• What you eat at each meal is based on an 11-day diet plan in which the types of calories you consume (proteins, carbohydrates, fats, fiber, starch, etc.) are shifted from meal to meal. In other words, in one meal you might only eat food from one or two food groups, and another combination of food groups during the next meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The science behind how the calorie shifting diet works is that by only introducing certain combinations of calories into your body at different times of the day each day, you are triggering a metabolic response in your body that induces burning fat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Can you &lt;I&gt;really&lt;/I&gt; lose 9 pounds every 11 days on the &lt;A target="_new" HREF="http://www.CalorieShiftingDiet.info"&gt;Calorie Shifting&lt;/A&gt; diet?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the Quickest Way to Lose Weight - A Diet Breakdown</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Jonathan_Drake"&gt;Jonathan Drake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second question people often ask when looking to lose weight is "what IS the best way to lose weight", the first is "what is the QUICKEST way to lose weight" We've all been there, it's no fun to be walking around carrying more pounds on us than we probably should. While balanced and healthy diet combined with exercise is always the best and safest approach for you bodies overall health, the fact still remains that losing weight quickly is important to people. And so for that reason I am providing you with a quick breakdown of some of the top dieting approaches, how they work, and what you need to know if you are looking to lose weight quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Low Carb Diets. Low carb diets can be one of the quickest ways to lose weight. I once lost 25 pounds in a mere 5 weeks with a low carb diet and I was not very heavy to begin with. The low carb diet is based around the idea that if you cut out carbohydrates - your bodies primary source of energy - that once deprived, your metabolism will flip from a carb burning metabolism to a fat burning metabolism. While low carb diets do certainly work, they are also the source of much controversy because the diets typically consist of unusually high amounts of meat and cheese, which raises certain questions about the diets heart healthiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Macrobiotic Diets. Macrobiotic diets are basically dietary regiments consisting largely of natural and staple foods such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables with the emphasis being on avoiding all processed foods. The macrobiotic diet is a very healthy and beneficial long term diet. While I highly recommend it for anyone seeking a healthier life, it is not necessary the quickest way to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. The Hollywood Diet. The Hollywood diet is a dietary regiment that basically involves drinking nothing but a supposed miracle juice over a 48 hour period. The claim is that you can lose as much as 10 pounds in that short amount of time. I have tried the Hollywood diet and it is true that it is a very quick way to lose weight, however, unfortunately the only significant weight you are losing is water weight. It would be physiologically impossible to lose anywhere near that amount of fat in such a short amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is one &lt;a target="_new" href="http://myfatlossformula.info"&gt;Diet&lt;/a&gt; that I didn't mention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a target="_new" href="http://MyFatLossFormula.Info"&gt;http://MyFatLossFormula.Info&lt;/a&gt; to find out which one. It really works!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What is the Quickest Way to Lose Weight Naturally and Safely?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=John_Cielo"&gt;John Cielo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;An often asked question is "What's the quickest way to lose weight?" And you have obviously asked it because you are reading this article. It could be because you have a wedding coming up, the office Christmas party, a beach holiday, or, you want to get your shape back after pregnancy, or any number of other reasons. Here, we'll explore together a way of achieving your goal, perhaps more easily than you suspected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to remember is a very simple balance equation, i.e. &lt;i&gt;calories in = calories out&lt;/i&gt;. Simply put, it means that if you can burn all the calories your body takes in through food and drink, you should not put on excess weight. And a key way you burn calories is through regular physical exercise. Unfortunately, the result of not burning enough calories is that the excess calories then turn to stored fat in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many people, like yourself, never achieve this &lt;i&gt;calorie balance&lt;/i&gt;. Why? Because most of us eat too much and do not take enough exercise to burn off those excess calories. In many cases this is as a direct result of our modern lifestyles. You are probably affected this way; in balancing work family commitments, you just do not have the time, or the energy, to do everything the TV chefs, dietary experts, and exercise gurus tell you to do. It is just so much hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is the quickest way to lose weight? Well, look at the equation. Simply put, you can either, drastically reduce your calorie intake (eat less food), or, burn up more calories (take more exercise). Or, as most people try to do; you can do both at the same time. Basically, you go on a dietary plan to reduce your calorie intake and start exercising in the gym and / or running around the streets and parks hoping to burn off your excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this does work if you have the time and energy to follow through with this type of weight-loss plan. But as you have seen above most of us do not have the time, or, the energy. And because of this, even if you do start on this type of plan, with the best will in the world, you probably will fail in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can you achieve this calorie balance and lose weight quickly? Think about it for a moment. If you could reduce your hunger pangs you would eat less, right? So your calorie intake would reduce, you would have less excess calories to burn off, so the amount of stored fat in your body would reduce. Alright then, how can you reduce your hunger pangs in a safe, controlled manner? The answer could lie in appetite suppressants. Or better still, &lt;i&gt;natural&lt;/i&gt; appetite suppressants, where the ingredient(s) come from natural resources such as plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of dietary supplements out there which can suppress your appetite. But there is one which not only suppresses your appetite, but increases your metabolism at the same time, which helps to burn off even more of your stored fat, so that you lose weight even more quickly. It also claims to increase your energy levels so that you feel more energized and better all round.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are now turning to these dietary supplements to achieve their weight-loss goals in a safe and easy way, and, which fits in with their busy lifestyles. This could be &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; ideal dietary solution to your question; "What is the quickest way to lose weight?"&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Lose Weight Quick - I Hate The Treadmill!</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Regina_Reeves"&gt;Regina Reeves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So you've done your research on how to lose weight quick, you've started a new eating plan and you are doing great with your diet. Now you just need to add a cardio workout to your routine, but the only piece of home equipment you have room for is your treadmill, and you hate it! It's just so boring even with a radio or TV. Sound familiar? Don't worry, you are definitely not alone. Many others have been in yours shoes and have gone through the same thing, just needing some cardio to complete a daily workout, but finding running or even walking on the treadmill just insanely boring, almost to the point of being intolerable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can you do for your workout that doesn't seem like torture? One thing that may help is to break up your routine into 15-minute sessions. Run or walk for 15 minutes, then get off and do some crunches or stretching, then back on the treadmill for another 15-minute session. You can also try listening to an audio book instead of the radio or TV. I actually use this and it really helps the time to fly by. Still seems like torture but not quite as bad and doesn't seem to last as long. Download an unabridged book to your iPod and you'll have 12 to 15 hours or so of company for your workout. Alternatively, you can read a book while walking. Some treadmills come with a place to set your book and hold it in place, but otherwise you can just rig it up yourself. I've used this method before but it's just easier nowadays to download the book and listen to it. But here is a tip to hold the book open if you go with that method - just use a big hair clip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some people, you just need a different workout entirely. If you have a local YMCA you can head over there for a workout every other day or so and add some variation to your routine with the many machines they have. It should also help to have some company. Bring a friend if you can, as that really helps the time go by faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swimming is another way you can get in your cardio. If you don't have a pool, the YMCA has this available as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Biking is another great alternative. But I recommend the real thing, and not the stationary bikes because I find those just as boring if not worse than the treadmills. If you have some bike trails around where you live, a bike is a great investment in your quest on how to lose weight quick because it will really burn through the calories fast. If you happen to live in an area where there are a lot of hills, that's even better. If you do think you would like the stationary bike, you can buy a device that allows your regular bike to be used in the house. I actually would prefer this rather than use those exercise bikes that have your arms going back and forth which makes no sense to me. Who rides a bike like that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of video games out now to help you lose weight, and those are really great for cardio. There is Dance Revolution, and Wii has a new fitness "game," and there are many others available so it should be no problem to find one that will grab your interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dancing is another great way to get your daily workout in and lose weight. If you are into country music, try some line dancing. Most cities have at least one country bar with a dance floor that has line dancing lessons on certain nights of the week. It's great exercise, lots of fun, and a super way to shed some pounds fast. If country is not your thing, take some ballroom dancing lessons. With all the dance programs on TV lately this has become very popular so you should be able to easily find a place to take some lessons. Great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cardio is a big part of how to lose weight quick, so try these tips to find a method that will work for you beyond the hated treadmill!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Lose Weight Quick - Stop The Yo-Yo Dieting Once And For All</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Regina_Reeves"&gt;Regina Reeves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I think we have all been a victim of yo-yo dieting. I know I sure have! You go on a diet, lose some weight, go off the diet and gain back all that weight plus more! Ugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many times this process continues, sometimes even for years, and you can end up gaining a lot of weight, sometimes even hundreds of pounds. It's a gradual thing so it sort of sneaks up on you, but it is very real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we avoid this yo-yo effect?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you have to do is put aside all the complicated diet plans, crazy things like eating all grapefruits or no carbs, no protein, whatever the fad of the day is, and simply remember that it basically just comes down to calories in versus calories out. Eat whatever you want but keep track of the calories and eat less than you need to maintain your weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That almost sounds too simple doesn't it? I think people really end up making things way too overcomplicated. It doesn't have to be that way. You don't have to read book after book, diet plan after diet plan. Just limit your calories. This is how to lose all the weight you want, and you can do it quick, depending on how many calories you cut out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you just focus on this and stop trying to count fat, carbs, protein, etc., it all gets a lot less complicated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other things to help you out. Don't skip breakfast. I don't really know if there's a scientific reason this helps or not but it does. I find that when I skip this meal I end up eating a lot more throughout the day. If I eat a hearty breakfast I eat less the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, don't eat right before going to bed. If you do, you'll usually end up not being too hungry when you wake up, and hence you will skip breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating earlier in the day is also a good practice as it gives you plenty of time to burn off those calories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat whatever you want but just keep track of the calories. Don't worry about portion size, etc. If you can remember it, you don't even have to write it down. Find your target number of calories and stay within it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very simple and easy way to lose weight quick. Nothing complicated about it and it actually works. Give it a try!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Counting calories not for you? Then don't!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Mirko_Van_Anken"&gt;Mirko Van Anken&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The best way to lose weight quickly is by paying attention to what you are putting into your body. Your diet is the most important thing when you are trying to lose weight quick. You will need to eat a healthy diet, drink a lot of water, and cut down on your portions and your snacking if you are serious about losing weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing when you want to lose weight quickly is making a change to your diet. You need to take a look at the things you are putting into your body. You might want to start counting calories. You also might want to write down everything you eat. You should eliminate foods that are fried, that contain a lot of oils, and that are greasy. These are inflammatory foods and bad for your skin and your body. You should increase your intake of fruits and vegetables and meats like fish. Beef and pork are the worst meats for you and they contain a lot of protein that can be hard to work off of your body. Fish is the healthiest for you and a good thing to lose weight quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Water is one of the most important things you need to add to your diet. If you are not a big water drinker then you need to become one. Your body needs a lot of water. Things like soda and coffee are considered diuretics. These diuretics make your body hold in the water. In addition, you need to drink twice as much water as you are drinking coffee and other things. Things like coffee and soda also make you thirstier which means you consume even more and your body is only holding it in. Drink a lot of water. Water cleanses the body and it will help you lose weight fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important thing you need to remember is that you need to cut down on your portions. If you eat three meals a day but your portions are enough to feed a couple of people then this isn't going to help you lose weight fast. You need to pay attention to the amount of food you are eating too. Changing your diet is great but you cannot eat too large amounts of food because it defeats the purpose. Cut your portions of food in half. You need to chew each bite much slower than you normally do. You will find the slower you chew, the less food you will need to be full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing you need to think about is your snacking habits. If you are a snacker, it is okay but you need to cut down. Be sure your snacks are healthy like an apple or cheese and crackers but your snack sizes are not the size of a meal. You should also stop any snacking after your dinner. No more midnight snacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to lose weight quick you need to make serious changes to your diet, the way you eat, and when you are eating. Eat less. Eat healthy. Drink a lot of water. You will see the weight begin to drop off of your body quickly when you make these important changes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Lose Weight Quick - What Motivates You?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Regina_Reeves"&gt;Regina Reeves&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Almost anyone who has decided they want to shed some pounds would like it to happen fast. If you are one of the many people trying to figure out how to lose weight quick, the first thing you should think of is what motivates you to stick with a diet or new eating plan? The easiest and fastest way to lose weight is not just finding a great diet or exercise plan but finding a way to stick to it. Here are a few goals you might use to motivate yourself. Some might seem silly and frivolous, but all are important to someone who has been overweight for a long time and remembers how it was to feel skinny or "normal" weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.  Become more in shape and be able to participate in sports and outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.  Want to look good in that black strapless dress or that new bathing suit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3.  Be able to shop for clothes at all "normal size people" stores in the mall rather than the specialized "large size" stores or online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.  Have more energy and stop feeling tired and run down all the time due to being overweight. Be able to go for long walks or jogging without feeling exhausted. Have enough energy to keep up with the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.  Have more choices of fun and fashionable clothes. Large-size clothes are sometimes a little frumpy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6.  Show up at the class reunion looking the same size as you did in high school or college. Maybe even smaller!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7.  Go horseback riding and not feel like you are too big to ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.  Go to the local water parks with your kids and not feel embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.  Be able to sit down and not feel rolls of fat overflowing the sides of your jeans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10. Being able to walk without your thighs rubbing together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you make a diet plan and stick to it along with exercising about 30 minutes a day, you'll be surprised how easy it is to lose weight quick and reach all your weight loss goals. Using these motivational tips can help you along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lose Weight - Quick Tips to Help You Lose Weight</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Shannon_Clark"&gt;Shannon Clark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're currently trying to lose weight, you will definitely have to put in some effort. Far too many people are searching for a mystery fat loss technique that will get them losing pounds without much effort from their part. Unfortunately, if they proceed to follow these 'quick fix' plans, chances are, they will be highly disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to lose weight you will have to make some adjustments to your current lifestyle and habits, but, if you are smart in how you go about doing this, it does not need to be all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick tips that you can use to help you lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get More Protein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you definitely don't need to go on an all-protein diet (which is strongly NOT recommended), foods that are higher in protein content will be much more satisfying than those that aren't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does the body need slightly more protein when dieting in order to protect lean muscle mass, but it will also help you feel satisfied for a longer period of time, thus make watching your calorie intake all the more easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're starving all the time, it makes it kind of hard to eat a low-calorie diet. Protein can help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Try Drinking More Hot Beverages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another easy trick to help with the hunger factor when dieting is to drink more hot beverages such as tea or coffee. Obviously you will need to pay attention to what you are adding to this - avoid any high calorie syrups, cream, or sugar, but the hot liquid in general will really tame your hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you do opt for a beverage that contains caffeine, that can give you an extra energy boost, which you might find you need while on a diet. You can overdo it with the caffeine, however, so be sure you monitor your intake appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add Sprints To Your Workout&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few individuals enjoy doing cardio in their quest to lose weight, but, it is something that normally does have to be included in a program to some extent. So, why not at the very least, maximize the time you spend doing this cardio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than performing thirty to forty-five minute sessions at a moderate pace - which is sure to bring on the boredom factor at an alarming rate, crank up the intensity with sprint sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprint session are a great deal shorter - usually lasting from anywhere between fifteen and twenty-five minutes, and will ramp your metabolic rate up much higher after they are performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, not only will you be spending less time on the cardio machines, but you'll get double the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are going to be more intense though, so be sure you do have some cardio based behind you. Work up to doing thirty minutes straight at a moderate intensity, then try incorporating some sprints into the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take A Diet Break&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! I know what you're thinking. "A diet break? How will that help me lose weight?!?" The answer is because far too many people are chronic dieters and because of this, their metabolism is already running slower than it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every three to four months you should always bring your calorie intake up a bit, hold it there for a week or two, and then bring it back down again. This will help to 'reset' the metabolism again, increasing the rate at which you are burning calories and really making a difference in the results you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you're struggling to get that scale moving, be sure you keep these tips in mind. Nothing is more frustrating than putting in a great deal of effort to not experience any results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How To Lose Weight Quick With Just A Little Planning</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Kristie_Chiles"&gt;Kristie Chiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You know, of course, that you are not the only person concerned about weight loss, especially before summertime and after Christmas!  You are probably really ready to rid yourself of that extra fat once and for all.  First, you must take a good look at your present state.  Are you over 40 and just beginning to get a roll around the middle?  Or perhaps you are a young mother who has just given birth for the first or third time?  Or, perhaps you are now working longer hours sitting at a desk or computer and the pounds are slipping up on you?  Is it possible that you are now in the state of life where terms such as "diabetes" and "heart disease" are beginning to take on new meaning as you begin to fit the profile of what you hear on a commercial?  Whatever your state, take heart there is hope!  And I will show you what and how to lose weight quick and change your body and change your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you must realize that the battleground consists of two phases - one is your daily stress and the only is your lean towards high-fat food.  The sad part is that this combination makes it very difficult to have the energy or desire to exercise which adds to more pounds.  Further, as we all know, trying to starve yourself backfires as your body holds onto to calories when you deliberately put into in a starvation state!  Amazingly, our bodies and our brain have a built-in signal to store fat.  Therefore, when you begin to try to lose fat, you find yourself working against this built-in mechanism.  Quick weight loss from starvation returns before you have time to brag about it!  You must learn how to turn off the fat-making mechanism and turn on and leave on the fat-burning mechanisms in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Shocking Truth About How To Lose Weight Quick!</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Sonja_Pruis"&gt;Sonja Pruis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you tried every possible way to lose weight without much success, don't feel bad, you're not alone. Contrary to popular belief, weight loss does not happen overnight and there's no magic formula or pill that will make you lose weight. Learn how to lose weight through a sensible diet plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The advice I'll give isn't likely to be all that different that what you might read elsewhere, but the combination is what worked well for me. Hopefully it'll motivate a few more people to do the same. I learned a lot about my habits and behavior in the process and suspect that much of it applies to most people who are struggling with extra pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of these diets - like the infamous Cabbage Soup Diet - can undermine your health, cause physical discomfort (abdominal discomfort and flatulence [gas] ) and lead to disappointment when you regain weight soon after you lose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick-weight-loss diets usually overemphasize one particular food or type of food. They violate the first principle of good nutrition: Eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods. If you are able to stay on such a diet for more than a few weeks, you may develop nutritional deficiencies, because no one type of food has all the nutrients you need for good health. The Cabbage Soup Diet mentioned above is an example. This so-called fat-burning soup is eaten mostly with fruits and vegetables. The diet supposedly helps heart patients lose 10-17 pounds in seven days before surgery. There are no "superfoods." That's why you should eat moderate amounts from all food groups, not large amounts of a few special foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These diets also violate a second important principle of good nutrition: Eating should be enjoyable. These diets are so monotonous and boring that it's almost impossible to stay on them for long periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In what other ways are quick-weight-loss diets flawed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many don't encourage physical activity - for example, walking 30 minutes most or all days of the week. Being physically active helps you maintain weight loss over a long time. Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because most quick-weight-loss diets require drastic changes in eating patterns, you can't stay on them for long. Following a regimen for a few weeks won't give you the chance to learn about how to permanently change your eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, many fad diets are based on "food folklore," some dating back to the early 19th century. They have not been documented to be safe in the long term.  Ideas about "fat-burning foods" and "food combining" are also classified by the American Heart Association as unsubstantiated myths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite what quick-weight-loss diet books may say, the only sensible way to lose weight and maintain a healthy weight permanently is to eat less and balance your food intake with physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the best way to lose weight?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A healthy diet rich in fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains and fat-free or low-fat dairy products, along with regular physical activity, can help most people manage and maintain weight loss for both cardiovascular health and appearance. The American Heart Association urges people to take a safe and proven route to losing and maintaining weight - by following our guidelines for healthy, nutritionally balanced weight loss for a lifetime of good health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, most overweight women don't want to be thin enough to achieve a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the study, one of the few to quantify the magnitude of body-weight dissatisfaction, which was published recently in the journal Eating Behaviors, most -- 78 percent -- of the overweight males surveyed also want to weigh less. But of this group, almost two-thirds -- 59 percent -- do not want to lose enough, so the body weight they desire would still keep them overweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 60 percent of U.S. adults are considered overweight or obese. And "because they don't meet the societal ideals propagated by the media and advertising for body weight, they are often targets of discrimination within educational, workplace and health-care settings and are stigmatized as lazy, lacking self-discipline and unmotivated," says Lori Neighbors, Ph.D. '07, who conducted the research with Jeffery Sobal, Cornell professor of nutritional sociology in Cornell's College of Human Ecology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Another Best Way to Lose Weight Quick</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Best Way To Lose Weight Quick&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Steve_Phipps"&gt;Steve Phipps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We all get to the point where we wake up one day, look in the mirror it is time to lose the extra weight. One of the first things we do is start searching for the best way to lose weight quick and generally it ends up being a huge mistake because we should also be looking for a diet program that will allow us to keep the weight off for good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the biggest catch to the whole dieting industry because many programs are designed for us to lose weight at a rapid pace but very few of them are something any normal person could stick with long term and keep the weight off. This is how a billion dollar industry is born. You pick a plan, drop the pounds, get off the plan and put the pounds back on again. A little while later what are we doing? Looking for the best way to lose weight quick yet again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies love the fact that they really do not supply us with the information necessary to actually stay at our ideal weight and actually bank on the fact that we will be back over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we really need is a way to lose the weight fast and keep it off by putting in place a program that actually helps us change our eating lifestyle without feeling hungry, miserable and tired all of the time. This is the real reason we stop and put the weight back on again, we are tired of feeling just plain horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the new calorie shifting diet plans are helping people see they can pick one of the best ways to lose weight quick, keep it off and not have to feel like they are starving themselves in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Do You Know How To Lose Weight Quick?</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Septimus_Smith"&gt;Septimus Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lose weight quick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a desire, but don't have knowledge on &lt;i&gt;how to lose weight quick&lt;/i&gt; and without any problems, you'd better look through my article and learn some quite quick and effective methods to &lt;i&gt;deal with the problem&lt;/i&gt;. At the very beginning I would like to tell you some information about diets in general and which from the list of various dieting advice and programs can be considered to be the best one. So, the &lt;i&gt;diet in general&lt;/i&gt; is the sum of food consumed by a person. Nevertheless, there exist various ways of keeping to a diet because tastes vary and different people like different foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is the most effective diet plan?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different surveys which were recently held has stated that the most effective diet plan is one that not only delivers you from your extra weight, &lt;i&gt;burns calories&lt;/i&gt; and feed muscles, make you slim and fit, but also improves your health. As you know, there are a lot of diet programs which are not beneficial for your health at all. That's why, before you &lt;i&gt;choose a diet&lt;/i&gt;, you should mind how balanced and planned the diet is. The most effective diet program to follow is well-balanced diet with losing your weight stage by stage. There are three main stages of a diet program. We will name them "waves".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Three waves&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wave 1&lt;/i&gt; is the stage when you get acquainted with &lt;i&gt;healthy eating habits&lt;/i&gt; and learn what and how to eat. In this stage you will learn not to eat large amounts of sugars, refined flour products and other foods which are considered to be unhealthy and fill your body with fat. After you start to keep to healthy eating rules, the result will surprise you. But don't be amazed: wave 1 is the period of the quickest weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wave 2&lt;/i&gt; is the major stage of the diet program, which you follow until your weight reaches the desired rate. You won't lose weight in this stage as quick as it was in the first wave, but it comes steadily. In this Wave you'll go on &lt;i&gt;keeping to healthy approach to eating&lt;/i&gt;, you savor each meal slowly, with an emphasis on health and enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wave 3&lt;/i&gt; is the part of the &lt;i&gt;maintenance&lt;/i&gt; of a positive effect of a diet plan. It usually starts when you have reached the weight you desire and become healthy and fit. Once you have learned healthy eating habits, you should follow them as long as you wish to keep your weight and stay healthy. Three stages is the secret how to lose weight quick and forever!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Don't consume &lt;a TARGET="_BLANK" href="http://www.ondiet.org/diet-pills.php"&gt;diet pills&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat healthy and tasty food and your &lt;a TARGET="_BLANK" href="http://www.ondiet.org/burnthefat.php"&gt;weight&lt;/a&gt; will be as you want!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many people that need or want to lose weight quickly it can be tough and overwhelming trying many different diets, pills, etc. This can be prevented if you do your research on different ways to lose weight quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many diet pills can give us the impression that they work wonders really fast when in reality they work different for every person and must be combined with a proper diet and exercise regimen. Some people expect to lose the weight without adding the diet and exercise because they believe the pill does it all by itself. This is where frustration can sink in and you can start to feel like there is no real way to lose weight quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, here are a few ideas to help you lose weight quick and naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Drink Water - Drinking water is one of the best things you can do for your health that will also help you lose weight. Water can help keep your stomach full by acting as an appetite suppressant. Replace your normal every day beverages with a glass of water and you will start to feel the benefits as well as lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat Regularly - By eating at least five times a day you can prevent hunger pains throughout the day and give your body the right amount of food. Be sure you portion each meal; you don't want to overeat and always be sure you eat breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of your day and many people tend to skip it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eat Plenty Of Fiber - By eating foods that are high in fiber you can rest assured that you will feel full longer and your bowel movements will be regular and normal. Many high fiber foods are low in calories so you are helping yourself feel fuller while reducing your calorie intake all in one step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consume Good Carbs - By eating the 'good' carbohydrates you can lose weight. Vegetables and fruits along with whole grains contain 'good' carbs that will prevent hunger pains while helping you lose weight quick. You might remind yourself when searching for 'good' carb foods to eat something that is 'from the earth.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all some really great tips to help you lose weight quick in a healthy natural way. It might be a little tough at first but once you get on track you will reap all those wonderful benefits of your weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Some Quick Tips on How to Lose Weight Fast</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Morgan_Hamilton"&gt;Morgan Hamilton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the past decades, people have become heavier in weight because they more sedentary than they ever have been before. The inactive children in this day and age are growing up to be obese adults. The average size of individuals has increased steadily and the average size of people these days is no longer healthy. People often want to know how to lose weight fast when they realize that they are overweight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to go on any type of diet or fitness program, then you should first get a doctor’s approval. If you have a large amount of weight to lose or if you have been overweight for a long period of time, then a doctor’s approval is crucial. It is a good idea to consult your doctor and find out what options are safest for you before you begin to learn how to lose weight fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have access to a large amount of information available on the Internet in this day and age. A lot of websites offer advice on doctor recommended diets and training programs. People who have discovered how to lose weight fast often post their personal experiences and success stories on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find exercise programs and tips for a healthier lifestyle on the World-Wide-Web. You have to take time in researching your options carefully if you want to feel better physically and emotionally. However, not everything on the web is healthy. You should talk to your doctor first, once you’ve found something you think you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A healthy diet with a manageable exercise program that increases in intensity as time goes by are combined in successful weight loss programs. A program that has a lot of support options like one on one chats, forums, and personal guidance may help you to learn how to lose weight fast. However, having someone leaning over your shoulder all the time may not be your preference. You can also try a program that simply gives you all the tools you needs, like grocery lists, menus, and a choice of exercise options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to do your research if you want to know how to lose weight fast. You also have to spend some time in discussing your personal history with your doctor and determine what is safe for you. Losing weight safely should be just as important as knowing how to lose weight fast. You can find out which programs have allowed people to experience long term success by looking into the many weight loss plans that are available.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lose Weight Quick Tips to Help You Lose Weight</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Shannon_Clark"&gt;Shannon Clark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you're currently trying to lose weight, you will definitely have to put in some effort. Far too many people are searching for a mystery fat loss technique that will get them losing pounds without much effort from their part. Unfortunately, if they proceed to follow these 'quick fix' plans, chances are, they will be highly disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to lose weight you will have to make some adjustments to your current lifestyle and habits, but, if you are smart in how you go about doing this, it does not need to be all that bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick tips that you can use to help you lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get More Protein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While you definitely don't need to go on an all-protein diet (which is strongly NOT recommended), foods that are higher in protein content will be much more satisfying than those that aren't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does the body need slightly more protein when dieting in order to protect lean muscle mass, but it will also help you feel satisfied for a longer period of time, thus make watching your calorie intake all the more easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you're starving all the time, it makes it kind of hard to eat a low-calorie diet. Protein can help with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Try Drinking More Hot Beverages&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another easy trick to help with the hunger factor when dieting is to drink more hot beverages such as tea or coffee. Obviously you will need to pay attention to what you are adding to this - avoid any high calorie syrups, cream, or sugar, but the hot liquid in general will really tame your hunger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you do opt for a beverage that contains caffeine, that can give you an extra energy boost, which you might find you need while on a diet. You can overdo it with the caffeine, however, so be sure you monitor your intake appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Add Sprints To Your Workout&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very few individuals enjoy doing cardio in their quest to lose weight, but, it is something that normally does have to be included in a program to some extent. So, why not at the very least, maximize the time you spend doing this cardio?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than performing thirty to forty-five minute sessions at a moderate pace - which is sure to bring on the boredom factor at an alarming rate, crank up the intensity with sprint sessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprint session are a great deal shorter - usually lasting from anywhere between fifteen and twenty-five minutes, and will ramp your metabolic rate up much higher after they are performed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, not only will you be spending less time on the cardio machines, but you'll get double the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are going to be more intense though, so be sure you do have some cardio based behind you. Work up to doing thirty minutes straight at a moderate intensity, then try incorporating some sprints into the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take A Diet Break&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes! I know what you're thinking. "A diet break? How will that help me lose weight?!?" The answer is because far too many people are chronic dieters and because of this, their metabolism is already running slower than it should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every three to four months you should always bring your calorie intake up a bit, hold it there for a week or two, and then bring it back down again. This will help to 'reset' the metabolism again, increasing the rate at which you are burning calories and really making a difference in the results you see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you're struggling to get that scale moving, be sure you keep these tips in mind. Nothing is more frustrating than putting in a great deal of effort to not experience any results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quick Ways to Lose Weight</title>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;By &lt;a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?expert=Kelvin_Ho_Wee_Min"&gt;Kelvin Ho Wee Min&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;With so many diets and weight loss plans on the market, there are many quick ways to lose weight nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among them, the South Beach Diet is one that has been gaining some attention. This diet focuses on the glycemic index where good carbs are separated from bad carbs, and bad fats from good fats. There are no calories to count– you eat until you are full, three times a day with two snacks in between. This diet works in phases where the first phase is extremely limited, followed by a second phase with the addition of good carbs, and finally the third phase which is a liberal maintenance plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another diet, the Atkins Diet, is often confused with the South Beach Diet. However, these two ways to lose weight differ in many ways. In the Atkins diet, all carbs are limited. The aim is to consume as few carbs as possible. No protein or fat is limited. This diet has raised some eyebrows due to its lack of concern for saturated fats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there is Nutrisystem, a complete eating plan where the food comes prepackaged in 4-week parcels. It focuses on the glycemic index, like the South Beach Diet, and offers a variety of foods you can choose from. All foods are instant, meaning that little preparation is required. Because everything is measured for you, this is an easier plan for those with portion control problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to lose weight is through the Fat Loss for Idiots diet plan, where foods and types of calories consumed changes every few days. With a menu that constantly changes, you’ll be able to eat many kinds of foods. The logic behind this diet is swap the menu when your body becomes accustomed to one menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, other effective ways to lose weight include exercises and there are many exercise plans to choose from these days. You can opt for video and DVD programs like The Firm or Tae Bo. You can also take up classes or training programs at the gym. Results vary due to the individual effectiveness of each program and the way participants eat during the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quick ways to lose weight also includes the Mediterranean Diet and the traditional Mediterranean lifestyle. In this type of diet, foods are rated as frequent, occasional and rare. Some foods are consumed everyday and with every meal while other foods are eaten once every few days. Then, there are foods that are consumed rarely. It is believed that the long lives of the Mediterranean people can be attributed to their diet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among ways to lose weight, one of the oldest diets is the low-calorie, low-fat diet. In such a diet, you are restricted to a certain number of calories per day, usually 1600 or less. Carbohydrates can be consumed regularly, while fat-free and low-fat foods are encouraged. The results of this type of diet is questionable as some claim that weight loss attained through this method may be loss of water and muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, there are many quick ways to lose weight. The trick with any diet is to stick to it and to maintain weight loss at the end of the diet. A diet should be looked at as a lifelong plan. With any diet, weight loss cannot be permanent without some diligence on the dieter’s part. So decide on a plan, take action and stick with it!&lt;/p&gt;
