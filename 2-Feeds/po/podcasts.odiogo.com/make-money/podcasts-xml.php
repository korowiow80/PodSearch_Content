      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lets discuss a case:</p>
<p>Your site is mentioned on a big PR7 charitable site for some charity work you did. When can you see the effect of this link on your site&#8217;s rankings on the search engine. When do you the link link juice of the site propagates to you.</p>
<p>Well, this happened to me about two months back. I immediately started tracking it so that I can get the answer for this question.</p>
<p><img src='http://www.jimkarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/link-juice-propagation-time.png' alt='Link Juice Propagation Time' align='left' />Two of my small niche sites were mentioned on a PR7 charity site. My friend who works for the charity informed me about it. Both of my current sites were PR2.</p>
<p>Its been two months for the event and here are my analysis for the same.</p>
<ul>
<li>I started seeing the benefit for the same from day 10<sup>th</sup> in SERPs. Even after the 10<sup>th</sup> day the SERPs were improving. After around 40 days the ranking stabilized.</li>
<li>The site which were already ranking on page three for a quite competitive keywords came up in top 10.</li>
<li>The site which was not ranking in top 10 pages (though the keyword was not as competitive as in the other case), the site didn&#8217;t come in top 50.</li>
<li>The keyword which was the anchor text for the link from the charity site was the one for which ranking improved most. But all the keywords &#8220;related&#8221; to that keyword have also shown traffic increase of around 20% each.</li>
<li>For the other keywords on the site, which were not related to the keyword in the anchor text of the link, there was hardly any difference in the traffic.</li>
<li>Even after two months, still both the sites have PR2</li>
<li>Total traffic improvement is around 45% for one site and around 32% for the other in last two months. I am assuming that the traffic will also increase in the third month.</li>
<li>All of the SERP changes are first seen in US based datacenters of Google and were very slowly propagated to other datacenters. It took around more than a month to see things on other datacenters what was visible on US datacenters.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have posted my results here. Tell me what information can you grab from this study? Does this say something about the link juice propagation time? Is PR still the king?</p>

      <description>Last month I wrote a small post about how I tried Infolinks and then moved to it from Kontera.
Its been more than a month since I am using Infolinks, instead of Kontera, on my sites. This post is the review of Infolinks services, providing information on how it is performing on my sites.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month I wrote a small <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/2009-03-15-infolinks-rocks-as-kontera-alternative.html" target="_new" rel="nofollow">post</a> about how I tried <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/go/infolinks.php" target="_new">Infolinks</a> and then moved to it from Kontera.</p>
<p>Its been more than a month since I am using Infolinks, instead of Kontera, on my sites. This post is the review of Infolinks services, providing information on how it is performing on my sites.</p>
<p>First, about the integration of the code in the site. It was very simple, just put the code in the footer file of all my sites. That is it. No other changes required in the site.</p>
<p>About the earnings part, I am damn happy about it. In Kontera, I used to make around $8,000 to $9,000 per month. But with Infolinks, I have made more than $12,000 in a month. That is a big 50% increase in what I used to make with Kontera. So hands down to Infolinks in this regard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/go/infolinks.php" target="_new" rel="nofollow"><img src='http://www.jimkarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/infolinks-review.png' alt='infolinks review' align="left" border="0" /></a>The earnings I am talking about are only from a subset of sites which I had with Kontera. I have still not moved 100% of my sites to Infolinks. I am moving them slowly. I think I will make even more when I move my other sites too. I am moving them slowly with time, so that I am able to track what sort of difference these new sites are making to my earnings.</p>
<p>I am sure when I will move most of my sites to Infolinks, it would be making me at-least $15,000 to $17,000 per month.</p>
<p>About the support part, I contacted their support team many times in last one month for adding my new sites. The response from the team was always within 24 hours. I really like a company if their support is prompt.</p>
<p>Overall, I would say <strong>Infolinks surely rocks</strong>. Thank god I moved.</p>
<p>If you still haven&#8217;t join them, <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/go/infolinks.php" target="_new" rel="nofollow">go ahead and give them a try</a>. I am sure you will thank me for it. <img src='http://www.jimkarter.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This article is a guest post from Abdulrehman from 3arn.net who teaches how to <a href="http://www.3arn.net/" target="_new">make money on the internet</a>. He is a 15-year old blogger who is pretty passionate about blogging and making money online.</em></p>
<p>Most bloggers go through confusion and usually can&#8217;t think of ideas for new posts once they have written their best ones, after which they usually come up with lame articles, stop writing articles or drop their niche and write posts which are aimless to any topic. Below are outlined, some great ways to keep your blog rich with fresh content which is related to your website.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t limit your blog&#8217;s topic</strong></p>
<p>It is always best to keep your blog a little on the side from your main niche, you can write articles on your main topic but keep other options open as well. Moreover, try to relate things out of your niche to your niche and write articles about things that you like.</p>
<p><strong>Diversify your blog&#8217;s categories</strong></p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter which stage your blog is at, you can always pick new categories which are related to your blog and keep them in mind, because looking at each of these categories will bring new post ideas to your mind, for example choose 10 blog categories, when you&#8217;re writin a new article pick a category which you haven&#8217;t written much about yet and think on it, because your mind wouldn&#8217;t be too drained out on that one, you&#8217;ll be able to come up with a creative post idea. Keep flipping categories and you&#8217;ll remain enriched with ideas. For example, my blog is in the make money online niche, but just because I have a category called &#8216;Tips&#8217;, I&#8217;ll write about anything which I feel is worthy for the category such as writing an article on finding the best torrents because it is good tip on P2P downloading.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to your blog&#8217;s readers</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, when you write an article you might miss something which is mentioned by some of your readers. If you feel it is worth a mention then go ahead and write a post on it because after all it is your blog&#8217;s readers who will be reading those articles. Also, read the comments on other blogs and if you see a hint of some topic mentioned by a commantator, just go ahead and write on it.</p>
<p><strong>Read your older posts</strong></p>
<p>When you write an article, you might miss something or might have learned something new about it. So it is best to give a look at your older articles once in a while because it might give you good ideas of follow-up articles.</p>
<p><strong>Make routine posts</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen many blogs with a routine post every week such as a sunday link love or wordless wednesday or funny friday which usually makes it easy to come up with posts because you don&#8217;t have to thin k of something entirely new.</p>
<p><strong>Point out to other great blogs</strong></p>
<p>When you see great articles written on other blogs you read and you think they will be useful to your blog&#8217;s readers then go ahead and write a second opinion on it, or review it. This will not only cover up a good post but might also help you gain attention by the original article author.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr. Aaron Greenspan of Think Computer Corporation sued Google in the small claims court for his $721, which he had in his account when Google closed his account giving reason of &#8220;posed a significant risk to our AdWords advertisers.&#8221;</p>
<p>The court gave the judgment in the favor of Mr. Aaron and Google has to pay him $721. Read the full story <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/aaron-greenspan/why-i-sued-google-and-won_b_172403.html" rel="nofollow" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
<p>When the judgment was given, Google&#8217;s paralegal lady protested saying: &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair! What if everyone whose account was canceled sued Google?&#8221;</p>
<p>Now that is the question to ask. After this judgment I am expecting that a lot more people will go to small claims courts in America to get their money back which they earned till the time their account was closed.</p>
<p>So, either Google need to provide the reason for the ban, or they will lose again in those courts.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I am using Kontera as in-text advertising from a long time and had very good relationship with them. I was also making some <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/2008-04-29-crossing-9000month-with-kontera.html" target="_new">good money</a> with them till recently. I had fixed CPM deal with them.</p>
<p>Few days back <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/go/infolinks.php" rel="nofollow">infolinks</a> invited me to join and test their program for a while. I tested their program for 3 days and the results was wonderful. It created me much more money than what Kontera was creating. So I decided to move to infolinks from Kontera.</p>
<p>But Kontera didn&#8217;t want to loose me, so that offered me even better fixed CPM rate than infolinks. But they could not sustain it as they were not making as much money from my sites as they were paying me. So they moved me back to the CPC based plan.</p>
<p>So I moved my biggest sites from Kontera to <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/go/infolinks.php" rel="nofollow">infolinks</a>. Infolinks is making me at-least 3 times of what Kontera is making me in CPC model.</p>
<p>My recent <strong>eCPM with infolinks is $3.00</strong> which Kontera can never even touch I think.</p>
<p><strong>Infolinks Affiliate Program</strong><br />
Info has their affiliate program which is not yet available to general public. You can contact their support to get it enabled for you. This program is really wonderful and out of the world. Here is the payment structure.</p>
<ol>
<li>For a small publisher referred through you, <strong>you get paid $25</strong>.</li>
<li>If the publisher creates more than 10,000 impression per day, <strong>you get paid $100</strong>.</li>
<li>If the publisher creates more than 100,000 impressions per day, <strong>you get paid $1000</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Wow! that is really wonderful. Its not very difficult to find publishers with more than 10,000 page view (please note, its page view and not uniques) per day. Also, on an average I think you will get 1 in 25 publishers who will be getting more than 100,000 page views a day.</p>
<p>So overall, <a href="http://www.jimkarter.com/go/infolinks.php" rel="nofollow"><strong>INFOLINKS ROCKS</strong> - Join Now</a>.</p>
