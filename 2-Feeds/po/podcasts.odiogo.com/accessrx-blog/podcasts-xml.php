      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>They Don&#8217;t Call it Sin City for Nothing</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest. One of the more popular reasons men go to Vegas is for action that <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> take place at a craps table or roulette wheel. And when men are planning on a great Vegas vacation, the last thing the want is a problem with their erectile function. Las Vegas and Viagra are two things that just naturally go together. So if you&#8217;re going to Las Vegas with the goal of enjoying some no-strings, recreational sex, here&#8217;s what you need to know.</p>
<div id="attachment_5486" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/craps-table.jpg" rel="lightbox[5485]" title="Where Vegas Meets Viagra"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5486" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/craps-table-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gambling isn&#39;t the only reason many people visit Las Vegas.</p></div>
<p>First, the lecture. Don&#8217;t be stupid: safe sex is the rule, and if you should leave Clark County in pursuit of recreational sex, condoms are mandatory at all legal brothels. They should be mandatory <em>any time</em> you&#8217;re with someone whose history you do not know, so be prepared, and don&#8217;t make exceptions. A sexually transmitted disease is not how you want to remember your Vegas vacation.</p>
<p><strong>Viagra in Vegas</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5487" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/vegas-strip.jpg" rel="lightbox[5485]" title="Where Vegas Meets Viagra"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5487" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/vegas-strip-300x223.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="223" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Just because someone says it&#39;s Viagra doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the genuine product.</p></div>
<p>Now, if you have suffered from erectile dysfunction (ED) and worry that it might be a problem while you&#8217;re in Las Vegas, then you&#8217;ll want to be prepared. You&#8217;re better off obtaining Viagra or another ED drug before you leave home. Sure, you can probably find someone on or off the strip willing to sell you a blue pill that looks like Viagra, but if you do you&#8217;re taking a huge risk. Fake Viagra is extremely easy to find, and at best it lightens your wallet without having any effect on your erectile function. At worst, it could contain harmful substances that could ruin your trip to Vegas by forcing a detour to the ER.</p>
<p><strong>Obtaining Viagra Legally in Las Vegas</strong></p>
<p>What if you&#8217;re in Las Vegas and you decide you want to get Viagra the legal way? Well, it&#8217;s just like getting Viagra anywhere else. You&#8217;ll need to find a doctor who will prescribe it for you, and you&#8217;ll need to take your prescription to a pharmacy to get it filled. Unless you happen to know a physician in Las Vegas, you&#8217;ll probably have the best luck if you search for a family practitioner or a urologist, because these two specialties write the majority of prescriptions for ED drugs.</p>
<div id="attachment_5488" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/waiting-room.jpg" rel="lightbox[5485]" title="Where Vegas Meets Viagra"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5488" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/waiting-room-300x211.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="211" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Spending even part of a Vegas vacation in a doctor&#39;s waiting room isn&#39;t much fun.</p></div>
<p>Here is a list of nine Las Vegas-area doctors, the first three of whom are urologists, with the rest being family practitioners. The list comes from <a href="http://weeklyseven.com/health/2012/02/23/top-docs-2012">weeklyseven.com&#8217;s guide to the best medicine in Las Vegas</a>.</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Dr. Claire Elaine Close 702-220-4006 (Urology)</li>
<li>Dr. Steven Bruce Kurtz 702-233-0727 (Urology)</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>A Legal, Alternative Way to Obtain Viagra</strong></p>
<p>If you should get to Vegas and then decide to visit a physician for a Viagra prescription, what do you do if the doctor can&#8217;t see you till next Friday and you&#8217;re leaving Wednesday? Your best bet is using a secure online facilitator. You will be asked to answer a health questionnaire that will be evaluated by a physician and, when appropriate, will result in a prescription for Viagra.</p>
<p>The best online facilitators ship the same day when you order early enough, and they will give you the option of overnight shipping, which you can have sent to you care of your hotel. Don&#8217;t worry: good online facilitators won&#8217;t ship you a package with labeling advertising what&#8217;s inside. They know to be discreet. Using an online facilitator also frees up a lot of time you would have spent in a waiting room and cooling your heels at a pharmacy.</p>
<div id="attachment_5489" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/man-at-work.jpg" rel="lightbox[5485]" title="Where Vegas Meets Viagra"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5489" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/man-at-work-300x224.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You can obtain real Viagra quickly without a traditional doctor&#39;s appointment.</p></div>
<p><strong>Keep it Safe, and Keep it Legal</strong></p>
<p>Going to Las Vegas in search of a good time is hardly unusual. Just don&#8217;t put yourself into a dangerous situation: make sure you always practice safe sex, and if you believe you need Viagra to cope with ED while you&#8217;re there, obtain it only from a licensed physician or a trusted online facilitator with an excellent track record.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in treating your ED while maintaining your privacy and enjoying the convenience of quick delivery, <a href="http://www.accessrx.com">AccesRx.com</a> is one of the nation&#8217;s top online facilitators and is staffed by excellent customer service representatives as well as U.S.-licensed physicians and pharmacists. <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/viagra/">They also offer overnight shipping</a> and ship the same day on orders received before 3 p.m. Mountain Time. Good luck and enjoy your stay in Sin City!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Value Involves More than Just Price</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5514" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 278px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/piggy-bank.jpg" rel="lightbox[5513]" title="Can You Buy Viagra Online for Cheap?"><img class="size-full wp-image-5514" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/piggy-bank.jpg" alt="" width="268" height="244" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">When buying Viagra online, price is not the only thing to consider.</p></div>
<p>Pfizer brings in about $1.6 billion per year in sales of its blockbuster drug Viagra. But Pfizer isn&#8217;t the company that sells Viagra to you. Instead, you have to choose which vendor to purchase the drug from. Of course you want to choose the one that&#8217;s the cheapest, right?</p>
<p>If you are interested in purchasing drugs like Viagra online, you&#8217;re bombarded with options. A Google search on &#8220;buy Viagra online&#8221; returns nearly 88 million search results. Clearly there are plenty of people who want to sell you Viagra, but how do you separate out the counterfeiters and how do you know which price comparisons are valid?</p>
<p><strong>Where to Begin<br />
</strong></p>
<p>You should compare prices based on dosage: though this, too, can be tricky. For example, some pharmacies price 100 mg Viagra tablets the same as 50 mg Viagra tablets. Because of this, many men would rather obtain a prescription for 100 mg tablets even if they only need 50 mg, because they can split the 100 mg tablets in half and effectively get twice the medication for the same price. When you compare Viagra prices online, you&#8217;ll notice that the respected websites don&#8217;t stray too far from the $20 to $25 per pill price you&#8217;ll find at your local pharmacy.</p>
<p><strong>Pfizer on Pricing</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5515" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/pfizer-logo.jpg" rel="lightbox[5513]" title="Can You Buy Viagra Online for Cheap?"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5515" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/pfizer-logo-300x196.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="196" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pfizer keeps prices of Viagra within a fairly small range.</p></div>
<p>Pfizer, the manufacturer of Viagra, is quite consistent in its pricing. On its own <a href="http://www.pfizer.com/vtprescribers/long/viagra_long.pdf">website</a>, Pfizer lists the average wholesale price in the state of Vermont as $24.52 per pill for 25, 50, and 100 mg tablets. A company called First Databank determines benchmark prices for what pharmacies in the United States are charged by wholesalers. First Databank&#8217;s pharmaceutical market surveys are used by insurance companies and other drug buyers for use in negotiating reimbursement paid to pharmacies by insurers.</p>
<p>First Databank doesn&#8217;t release their average wholesale price data, but pharmacies and online facilitators use the data along with competition data to determine their prices for prescription drugs like Viagra.</p>
<p><strong>Is There a Generic?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Because Viagra has not gone off-patent yet, generics are not available in the United States, no matter what all those internet ads say.</p>
<p>Right now, Korean drug maker CJ, has a generic version of Viagra called &#8220;Heragra&#8221; ready to go for around $4.25 per pill, but Pfizer recently stated that their patent for the active ingredient in Viagra is valid until 2014. U.S. generic drug manufacturers have not been able to convince courts that the expiration of patent for the compound itself, Sildenafil, on May 17, 2012 should allow production of generics.</p>
<p>Pfizer says that their patent on the use of Sildenafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction does not expire until May 2014, and so far courts have agreed. Therefore, you won&#8217;t be seeing generic Viagra until at least May 2014.</p>
<p><strong>Counterfeits Are Extremely Common</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5516" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/fake-v-real-viagra.jpg" rel="lightbox[5513]" title="Can You Buy Viagra Online for Cheap?"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5516" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/fake-v-real-viagra-300x279.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="279" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fake Viagra can look an awful lot like the real thing.</p></div>
<p>While many online ads for &#8220;Viagra&#8221; try to convince you to buy &#8220;herbal&#8221; or &#8220;natural&#8221; Viagra, these compounds do not have the active ingredient in real Viagra, and there is no proof that they work at all. Furthermore, if you find &#8220;real Viagra&#8221; or &#8220;genuine Viagra&#8221; online for just a few dollars per pill, you can bet that they&#8217;re counterfeit, even if you open them up and they look just like the real thing. Viagra is <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/erectile-dysfunction/counterfeit-viagra-cialis-levitra-ultimate-guide">one of the most commonly counterfeited prescription drugs</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, counterfeit drugs are sometimes a problem even with Canadian pharmacies. While people in the United States tend to automatically trust Canadian websites and particularly Canadian pharmacies (since so many U.S. residents cross the border to shop at brick and mortar Canadian pharmacies), there is no simple way to be sure that Canadian pharmacy websites obtain their products from legitimate drug wholesalers or manufacturers, or that they&#8217;re really located in Canada.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re comparing real Viagra made by Pfizer, don&#8217;t expect more than a few dollars&#8217; difference between prices online. You can save some money, but you should also factor in things like shipping options, costs for shipping, and how long it takes to receive your order.</p>
<p><strong>Compare Prices, Look for Certification</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5517" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 228px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/secure-medical-certified1.jpg" rel="lightbox[5513]" title="Can You Buy Viagra Online for Cheap?"><img class="size-full wp-image-5517" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/secure-medical-certified1.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="143" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Look for pharmacies that have passed stringent certification requirements.</p></div>
<p>When you compare prices of Viagra online, try to ensure that you are comparing prices among legitimate websites. Signs that you&#8217;re buying from a legitimate supplier of authenticated Viagra include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring a prescription for Viagra before it can be dispensed</li>
<li>An actual street address (not a P.O. Box) for the website</li>
<li>The promise to sell only FDA-approved medications</li>
<li>The presence of U.S.-certified pharmacists and physicians on staff</li>
<li>Secure Medical Certification seal on the website</li>
<li>Physicians on staff to issue valid prescriptions based on medical history and online questionnaire data</li>
<li>Patient identity and age verified by phone or electronically</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have narrowed down your selection of providers to those who are legitimately selling actual Viagra manufactured by Pfizer, you&#8217;re ready to compare prices, including shipping costs and options.</p>
<p><strong>Too Good to Be True?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5518" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bag-of-fake-viagra.jpg" rel="lightbox[5513]" title="Can You Buy Viagra Online for Cheap?"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5518" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bag-of-fake-viagra-300x193.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="193" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">You know the old saying about things that seem too good to be true.</p></div>
<p>When it comes to blockbuster drugs like Viagra, the temptation for counterfeiters and scammers is great. That&#8217;s why you find so many sites advertising Viagra (or herbal or &#8220;generic&#8221; Viagra) at cut-rate prices. Legitimate online facilitators and pharmacies won&#8217;t be selling Viagra for a price significantly different from Pfizer&#8217;s average wholesale price of $24 and change. So if you see Viagra for significantly less than that, you can be fairly certain of one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What they&#8217;re selling you is not real Viagra</li>
<li>It will probably be ineffective</li>
<li>It could be harmful</li>
<li>They may simply collect your payment and your credit card data and disappear</li>
</ul>
<p>The old cliché about things that appear too good to be true usually are applies especially well to online Viagra sales. The enormous popularity of the drug, the consensus that it is safe when taken as directed, and the inability for U.S. Customs to examine every package coming into the country provides a huge opportunity for scammers and counterfeiters. And even if their website is shut down, you can bet it will pop up under a new domain within a few days or weeks.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in safely and securely obtaining authenticated Viagra that has been manufactured by Pfizer, be sure to check <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/">AccesRx.com</a>. This U.S.-based online facilitator has been in business since 1998 and is located in Tempe Arizona.

With the invention of <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/erectile-dysfunction/safe-buy-viagra-online">Viagra</a>, constant commercials about ED medications and the willingness of men to talk about the problem, this condition has become less taboo and more understood. Millions of men battle erectile dysfunction, and those that don’t may worry the condition will someday plague them. Medications like Viagra, Staxyn and Cialis can help, but there are things men can do prevent erectile dysfunction. The following tips are from the Mayo Clinic website.</p>
<p><strong>Change Your Lifestyle</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you smoke, quit.</strong> If you have trouble quitting, get help. Try nicotine replacement (such as gum or lozenges), available over-the-counter, or ask your doctor about prescription medication that can help you quit.</li>
<li><strong>Lose weight.</strong> Being overweight can cause — or worsen — erectile dysfunction.</li>
<li><strong>Get regular exercise.</strong> This can help with underlying problems that play a part in erectile dysfunction in a number of ways, including reducing stress, helping you lose weight and increasing blood flow.</li>
<li><strong>Get treatment for alcohol or drug problems.</strong> Drinking too much or taking certain illegal drugs can worsen erectile dysfunction directly or by causing long-term health problems.</li>
<li><strong>Work through relationship issues.</strong> Improve communication with your partner and consider couples or marriage counseling if you&#8217;re having trouble working through problems on your own.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Make Healthy Decisions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work with your doctor to manage diabetes, heart disease or other chronic health problems.</li>
<li>See your doctor for regular checkups and medical screening tests.</li>
<li>Stop smoking, limit or avoid alcohol, and don&#8217;t use street drugs.</li>
<li>Exercise regularly.</li>
<li>Take steps to reduce stress.</li>
<li>Get help for anxiety or depression.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Coping and Support</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ed3.jpg" rel="lightbox[5522]" title="Preventing Erectile Dysfunction and Coping With It"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5523" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ed3.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="100" /></a>Don&#8217;t assume erectile dysfunction is a long-term problem. Talk to your doctor about treatments, but understand that many men do overcome the condition. Talk to your partner about the problem and include them in the conversation about treatments plans. If you have more questions, there are <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/erectile-dysfunction/best-5-erectile-dysfunction-forums">online support groups and forums that can offer help</a>.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/meal1.jpg" rel="lightbox[5495]" title="Researcher Questions the Value of a Family Meal"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5497" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/meal1.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="99" /></a>Parents often try to corral their kids around dinnertime. In between band practice, work and hockey tournaments, finding quality family time can be tough. A family dinner represents a devoted slot of time where family members can talk and share details about their life. Many believe it is an important cornerstone of the family structure, but a new study questions this logic.</p>
<p><strong>Not as important as once thought</strong></p>
<p>A researcher from Cornell Unversity says her study shows the family meal does offer the instant bond many associate with it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We find that most of the association between family meals and teen well-being is due to other aspects of the family environment. Analyses that follow children over time lend even weaker evidence for causal effects of family meals on adolescent and young adult well-being,&#8221; said Kelly Musick, associate professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell and lead author of &#8220;Assessing Causality and Persistence in Associations Between Family Dinners and Adolescent Well-Being,&#8221; to be published in the June edition of the <em>Journal of Marriage and Family</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Building family</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/meal.jpg" rel="lightbox[5495]" title="Researcher Questions the Value of a Family Meal"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5496" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/meal.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="99" /></a>Musick’s study shows family meal times are tied to other factors including, income, family dynamics and communication skills. Musick believes family dinners alone aren’t the reason a family functions well, instead, it’s a combination of factors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meals may afford a regular and positive context for parents to connect with children emotionally, to monitor their social and academic activities, and to convey values and expectations. This is what we suspect is driving any causal relationship between family dinners and child well being. But, family dinners also appear to be part and parcel of a broader package of practices, routines, and rituals that reflect parenting beliefs and priorities, and it&#8217;s unclear how well family dinners would work unbundled from the rest of that package,&#8221; said Musick.</p>

      <description>All That Annoying Spam Does Pique Our Interest It doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to matter whether you&amp;#8217;re male, female, single, in a relationship, age 18 or age 80: annoying spam messages urging you to buy &amp;#8220;Herbal Breakthrough Formula!&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Viagra + Cialis &amp;#8230; &lt;a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/erectile-dysfunction/safe-buy-viagra-online"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class="meta-nav"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/accessrx-blog/Accessrx_Blog-Is_It_Safe_to_Buy_Viagra_Online.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>All That Annoying Spam Does Pique Our Interest</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5441" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/email-symbol.jpg" rel="lightbox[5440]" title="Is It Safe to Buy Viagra Online?"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5441" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/email-symbol-300x295.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="295" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ugh. Not another email about the wonders of &quot;Herbal Viagra.&quot;</p></div>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to matter whether you&#8217;re male, female, single, in a relationship, age 18 or age 80: annoying spam messages urging you to buy &#8220;Herbal Breakthrough Formula!&#8221; or &#8220;Viagra + Cialis from Canadian Pharmacy!&#8221; flood your email box daily. Fortunately, spam filters keep most of these messages out of your inbox, but have you ever wondered why after years of everyone knowing that these messages are fake they&#8217;re still used so extensively?</p>
<p>The truth is, erectile dysfunction is very common, and what man doesn&#8217;t wonder if maybe this &#8220;generic Viagra&#8221; or &#8220;herbal Viagra&#8221; actually, against all odds, works? An occasional problem getting an erection is a near-universal experience, and many men wonder if it means they&#8217;re losing erectile function and if they should do something about it.</p>
<p>True erectile dysfunction, which is a more persistent problem, affects around 40 million American men of all ages. The man who has never wondered if he&#8217;s at risk for developing erectile dysfunction and who has never hoped that there&#8217;s a safe, cheap, and widely available product that can prevent ED probably doesn&#8217;t exist in an internet-connected world.</p>
<p><strong>Why People Want to Buy Viagra Online</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5442" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 239px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/businessman.jpg" rel="lightbox[5440]" title="Is It Safe to Buy Viagra Online?"><img class="size-full wp-image-5442" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/businessman.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="296" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">It can be a hassle to take half a day off to visit a doctor.</p></div>
<p>Another reason those ads for &#8220;cheap Viagra&#8221; and other erectile dysfunction treatments resonate with so many men is that buying Viagra online has a great appeal. A lot of men don&#8217;t like going to the doctor with anything short of a severed limb, and they definitely don&#8217;t want to schedule what usually ends up being several hours out of their workday to talk to a doctor about the possibility they might have erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the men who do go to the trouble of visiting their physician, pouring out their sexual history, and obtaining a prescription usually do not look forward to taking that prescription to their local pharmacy, where they not only have to face a pharmacy technician, but also risk running into a neighbor, drinking buddy, or Little League parent.</p>
<p>It only makes sense that men want to buy Viagra online. After all, a person&#8217;s sex life and erectile function are very private subjects. Even sharing their concerns with their partner can be difficult. They would much rather be able to go online, answer some health questions, and after a physician reviews their information, receive a prescription that they can fill online and have delivered to their door in a discreet, plain package.</p>
<p><strong>What Customers Should Look For</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5467" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 228px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/secure-medical-certified.jpg" rel="lightbox[5440]" title="Is It Safe to Buy Viagra Online?"><img class="size-full wp-image-5467" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/secure-medical-certified.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="143" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Look for online facilitators that are Secure Medical Certified.</p></div>
<p>Fortunately, such places exist on the internet. Unfortunately, so do hundreds, if not thousands, of shady websites that exist only to separate vulnerable men from their money by promising products that are ineffective or dangerous. It<em> is</em> safe to buy Viagra online, but only provided you take several necessary precautions to protect your health and your identity.</p>
<p>Any reputable online facilitator should have, in addition to a web address, a real street address (not a P.O. Box) and a real phone number. They should require a prescription in order to dispense Viagra or any other prescription medication, and they should have a strong authenticity program to ensure that the drugs they dispense are the real, name-brand drugs made by major pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer (maker of Viagra).</p>
<p>Reputable U.S. sites selling Viagra online have carefully-developed health questionnaires that customers complete online, and which are then reviewed by U.S.-licensed physicians. If the physician thinks that Viagra (or whatever prescription drug the customer would like) is appropriate given his questionnaire answers, the customer&#8217;s age and address are verified, and a prescription is issued that can be filled on the same website.</p>
<p>Look for online facilitators that are Secure Medical Certified. These sites have to meet strict requirements about customer privacy, security, and quality assurance.</p>
<p><strong>What Customers Should Avoid</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5443" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cheap-viagra-screencap.jpg" rel="lightbox[5440]" title="Is It Safe to Buy Viagra Online?"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5443" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/cheap-viagra-screencap-300x165.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="165" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">If you see this, click elsewhere, or there&#039;s no telling what you&#039;ll receive.</p></div>
<p>Avoid sites that purport to sell &#8220;generic Viagra&#8221; (or generic Cialis or Levitra) because FDA-approved generic versions of these drugs do not yet exist. Also avoid sites that have prices that are significantly lower than what you would pay at your local pharmacy. Prices for drugs like Viagra are set by manufacturers, and there is not a lot of maneuvering room for pharmacies to offer major discounts. Prices will vary to some degree, but if you&#8217;re seeing Viagra for $10 per pill or less, be very wary.</p>
<p>Customers should avoid websites that do not require a prescription in order to dispense prescription drugs. The likelihood of receiving counterfeit drugs is very high, and it&#8217;s possible you could hand over your credit card information and not receive anything in return. Websites that do not have a legitimate street address, that are written in broken English, or that are smothered in American or Canadian flags should also be approached with great caution.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions on Safety of Buying Viagra Online</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5445" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 306px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/viagra.jpg" rel="lightbox[5440]" title="Is It Safe to Buy Viagra Online?"><img class="size-full wp-image-5445" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/viagra.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="120" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Real Viagra is made by Pfizer and lot numbers can be confirmed with the company.</p></div>
<p>The truth is you <em>can</em> buy Viagra online safely. You cannot buy Viagra online safely for a couple of dollars per pill. Expect to pay prices close to those your local pharmacy or a nearby chain pharmacy charges, and expect to answer health questions online before being able to purchase Viagra.</p>
<p>Sites like AccessRx.com and eDrugstore.MD are examples of online facilitators that pass all the tests. These sites have real-world locations in the United States, and have physicians and pharmacists on staff to review customer requests, answer questions, and process orders. And they only contract with U.S.-licensed pharmacies that receive their drugs directly from verified wholesalers or drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>Sites like these have long track records (over a decade in the cases of AccessRx.com and eDrugstore.MD) and use major shippers like FedEx and the U.S. Post Office. They also understand that customers don&#8217;t want the contents of their shipments openly displayed on packaging, and are committed to customer privacy and online security.</p>
<p>Your sexual health is important enough that you don&#8217;t want to entrust it to a spam site that offers &#8220;Viagra&#8221; at cut-rate prices without a prescription. If you want to <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/">try drugs like Viagra</a> for erectile dysfunction, go the extra mile and thoroughly check out your online facilitator so that you can be assured that you&#8217;re receiving the genuine product and that it is appropriate for your particular needs.</p>

Patients waiting for a kidney transplant have reached out to people on Facebook for help. On average, patients waiting for a kidney sit on the list for five years. It’s one of the reasons people are taking control of their own medical destiny and asking for donors to come forward via Facebook. A Loyola University study looked into the success of these requests.</p>
<p><strong>More than a status update</strong></p>
<p>Researchers examined 91 Facebook pages that were seeking kidney donations for patients ranging in age from 2 to 69. Here’s what they found:</p>
<ul>
<li>On pages in which relationships could be determined, 37 percent of the pages were created by patients, 31 percent by their children and 32 percent by other family or friends.</li>
<li>Twelve percent of the pages reported receiving a kidney transplant and 30 percent reported that potential donors had stepped forward to be tested to determine whether they were compatible.</li>
<li>One page reported that more than 600 people had been tested as potential donors for a young child.</li>
<li>Patients who were successful in soliciting people to be tested for donation were more likely to be white, have polycystic kidney disease and provide transplant website information.</li>
<li>Successful patients had more than 50 posts by the creator of the page and more than 50 posts by others.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kid.jpg" rel="lightbox[5469]" title="Social Media Helps Some Receive Kidney Transplant"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5470" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/kid.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="98" /></a>Some of the study&#8217;s findings raise ethical concerns. Three percent of the pages received offers to sell kidneys, mostly from people in Third World countries.</li>
<li>Would-be donors typically asked for $30,000 to $40,000. However, selling organs is illegal.</li>
<li>Only 5 percent of pages mentioned the risks of kidney donation, and only 11 percent mentioned associated costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Further studies are needed to understand the full impact of social media. Researchers believe future inquiries should look into ethical and safety concerns.</p>

<p>In 2011, more than 1,700 cases of <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/research/counterfeit-medications-online/">drug counterfeiting</a> were identified, and there&#8217;s no way of knowing how many more counterfeit operations went undetected. While there are few reliable estimates of how lucrative the global trade in counterfeit drugs is, most informed sources place it in the tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Today, pharmaceutical supply chains extend over several continents, with over 80% of active ingredients for U.S.-manufactured drugs now made overseas. These extensive supply chains have actually made it easier to ship counterfeit drugs into the U.S. And while the most frequently counterfeited drugs are &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; drugs like those used to treat erectile dysfunction (Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra, for example), counterfeit versions of other drugs, including the cancer drug <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204059804577225640701811020.html">Avastin</a>, have also been seized. Frighteningly, there&#8217;s no good way of knowing how many, if any cancer patients may have received the fake Avastin.</p>

<p><strong>What You Could Get in a Counterfeit Drug</strong></p>
<p>Legitimate pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer sometimes order and analyze &#8220;drugs&#8221; purchased from various online outlets. For example, when Pfizer ordered Viagra from 26 online outlets and analyzed them in their laboratories, they discovered that 81% f the drugs were fake. When you take a counterfeit drug, at best you may get a placebo-type drug with no active ingredient. At worst, you could ingest something dangerous. Here are a few of the ingredients that have been found in counterfeit drugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crushed wall board</li>
<li>Printer ink</li>
<li>Amphetamines</li>
<li>Boric acid</li>
<li>Rat poison</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Where Do Counterfeit Drugs Come From?</strong></p>
<p>Many counterfeit drugs have been traced to China, Singapore, and India. Sometimes, websites selling fake drugs claim to be shipped from Canada when in reality they are shipped from one of these other countries. In April, 2012, officials with the Canada Border Services Agency <a href="http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/manitoba-rcmp-border-guards-seize-counterfeit-erectile-dysfunction-drugs-148330465.html">discovered around 2,400 counterfeit Viagra and Levitra pills</a> inside electric rice cookers that were shipped to Canada from China.</p>
<p>Stopping the flow of counterfeit drugs has become a joint undertaking between governments and legitimate pharmaceutical companies. For example, in 2011 Europe passed legislation that requires each pack of drugs to be identified by a unique serial number. When the law is implemented in 2016, hospitals and pharmacists will scan bar codes to ensure that the product is legitimate. Pharmaceutical companies often have their own global security teams made up of former FBI and narcotics agencies. Results of sting operations are shared with the relevant authorities in other countries.</p>
<p><strong>How Can You Identify Fake Drugs?</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5359" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fake-v-real-viagra.jpg" rel="lightbox[5356]" title="Counterfeit Viagra, Cialis, Levitra: The Ultimate Guide"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5359" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/fake-v-real-viagra-300x279.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="279" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Subtle differences are evident between fake and real Viagra.</p></div>
<p>Protect yourself from counterfeit drugs by taking the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid ordering from websites offering drugs at prices far lower than your local pharmacy. &#8220;Too good to be true&#8221; prices usually indicate a problem.</li>
<li>Avoid sites that sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription</li>
<li>Do not buy &#8220;generic,&#8221; &#8220;fast dissolve,&#8221; or &#8220;soft tab&#8221; versions of Cialis. Real Cialis is only available as an almond-shaped tablet that you swallow whole.</li>
<li>Do not reply to unsolicited email ads for ED drugs. Legitimate pharmaceutical companies do not email patients unless the patient specifically requests information and do not sell their drugs directly to patients.</li>
</ul>
<p>While it&#8217;s sometimes hard to know for sure if a drug you&#8217;ve ordered online is a counterfeit, here are two possible ways to tell:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a sample tablet that you received from your doctor, compare the drug you ordered with the sample drug. If the look, feel, printing, color, or font is different, you may have received a counterfeit.</li>
<li>Monitor how the medication tastes and how it makes you feel. If it tastes &#8220;wrong&#8221; or gives you unusual symptoms, beware. You should report such situations to your physician promptly and stop taking the medication.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What to Do If You Think You Received Counterfeit Drugs</strong></p>
<p>Physicians are learning to recognize signs in patients that they have taken fake drugs. If, for example, a patient reports that his treatment is no longer working, or that he has developed unusual side effects, the physician should ask where the drug came from. Reporting possible counterfeit drugs to your physician can help him or her recognize the possibility of other patients taking counterfeit drugs.</p>
<p>If you receive a drug from an online pharmacy and it does not work, does not look right, or gives you symptoms you&#8217;ve never had before, stop taking it immediately and notify your doctor. Your physician may want to make a report to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Do not take chances with a drug that may be counterfeit.</p>
<p>You can also report suspected counterfeit drugs to the FDA through the agency&#8217;s <a href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/email/oc/buyonline/buyonlineform.cfm">MedWatch</a> program. The MedWatch program is confidential and secure, and the information you submit will be reviewed by a pharmacist, doctor, or nurse working for the FDA as a safety evaluator. If necessary, the FDA will work with federal law enforcement to put a stop to a website that is found to be selling counterfeit drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Counterfeiting Is Hard to Stop</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_5360" class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/barcode-scanner.jpg" rel="lightbox[5356]" title="Counterfeit Viagra, Cialis, Levitra: The Ultimate Guide"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5360" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/barcode-scanner-300x242.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="242" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Serial numbers will be attached to drug batches in Europe starting in 2016.</p></div>
<p>Drugs for erectile dysfunction and other &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; drugs are the most commonly counterfeited drugs, though counterfeiters are branching out into other types of drugs. The counterfeit drug trade is very lucrative, and the risks to drug counterfeiters are not that great. For example, in the U.S., drug counterfeiting usually results in a 3-year prison sentence upon conviction. By contrast, counterfeiting money would draw a 15-year sentence.</p>
<p>While government and private initiatives can help identify and stop existing counterfeiters, it is likely that new counterfeit operations will spring up to replace the old ones, and that counterfeiters will develop their own techniques to get around legislative requirements like the new European requirements for bar codes and serial numbers. This means that you have to take steps to protect yourself, and that if you receive a drug that may be fake, you should err on the side of caution and refrain from taking it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no disputing the convenience and savings available from <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/">buying drugs for ED through legitimate online pharmacies</a>, but you must be careful not to be drawn into ordering from a pharmacy that sells counterfeit drugs.</p>

      <description>Two separate studies show sleep apnea, a common disorder that causes difficulty breathing while asleep, is linked to cancer.

It’s estimated about 28 million Americans have some form of sleep apnea, which interrupts a person&#8217;s <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/ways-improve-snooze-jd0306">restful sleep</a> and typically causes <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/snoring-killing-you-jd0509">snoring</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The link</strong></p>
<p>“This is really big news,” said Dr. Joseph Golish, a professor of sleep medicine with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland who was not involved in the research. “It’s the first time this has been shown, and it looks like a very solid association,” he said.</p>
<p>According to a NY Times article, “In one of the new studies, researchers in Spain followed thousands of patients at sleep clinics and found that those with the most severe forms of sleep apnea had a 65 percent greater risk of developing cancer of any kind. The second study, of about 1,500 government workers in Wisconsin, showed that those with the most breathing abnormalities at night had five times the rate of dying from cancer as people without the sleep disorder. Both research teams only looked at cancer diagnoses and outcomes in general, without focusing on any specific type of cancer.”</p>
<p><strong>More studies needed</strong></p>

Javier Nieto, one of the study’s authors and chairman of the department of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin. “It could be something else, but it’s hard to imagine that something we didn’t control for is causing this.”</p>
<p>Both studies were observational studies, which come with limitations. The link between cancer and sleep apnea has been detected in animals, but these studies are the first to suggest the connection also exists in humans.</p>
<p>“I would say that this is one more instance that shows that sleep apnea can have profound impacts for people’s health,” he added. “Not breathing while you’re sleeping is a serious problem.”</p>

      <description>A new study shows a hospital stay can have a negative impact on an elderly patient. Researchers from Chicago say cognitive problems increase after an elderly person is hospitalized.

Researchers from Chicago say cognitive problems increase after an elderly person is hospitalized.</p>
<p><strong>The effects of hospital stays</strong></p>
<p>Data collected for 15 years in Chicago as part of an aging project shows <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/current-health-news/berry-l0509">memory and thinking skills</a> dropped after older patients dealt with a hospital stay.</p>
<p>“Essentially, it’s as if people became 10 years older, from a cognitive standpoint, than they actually were before a hospitalization,” Dr. Wilson lead author of the report and a professor of neurological and behavioral sciences at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago said. “Especially vulnerable to this effect were patients with more serious illnesses who stayed in the hospital for longer periods of time, and patients who started experiencing worsening memory and thinking problems before they were admitted.”</p>
<p><strong>The cause</strong></p>
<p>Researchers aren’t sure what’s causing the mental decline. “Is this cognitive insult caused by the illness that brought the patient to the hospital, or by what we do in the hospital?” <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/old2.jpg" rel="lightbox[5423]" title="Study: Hospital stays mentally hurt elderly"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5425" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/old2.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Dr. Boustani, associate professor of medicine at Indiana University asked. “It appears to be both.”</p>
<p>“What this new research does is add another layer and show that there’s also this cognitive loss that’s occurring,” he said. “While we suspected this before, there wasn’t strong enough data to firmly establish it before this study.”</p>
<p><strong>Advice for children of elderly parents</strong></p>
<p>In many cases, children are <a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/baby-boomers-paul-briand/consequences-caregiving">providing care for elderly</a> parents. Doctors involved with this study advise children to be aware of these potential problems.</p>
<p>“Know that when your elderly parent is coming out of the hospital, this has the potential to be a very vulnerable period,” Dr. Covinsky said. “Whatever need your parent had prior to the hospitalization, there’s a good chance they may change and that more support will be required.”</p>

However, a new study shows scientific evidence that not looking does actually reduce pain.</p>
<p><strong>How we perceive pain</strong></p>
<p>A group of German investigators has found that, in fact, your past experience with needle pricks, along with information you receive before an injection, shape your pain experience. Their research is published in the May issue of <em>Pain.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Throughout our lives, we repeatedly experience that needles cause pain when pricking our skin, but situational expectations, like information given by the clinician prior to an injection, may also influence how viewing needle pricks affects pain,&#8221; says lead author Marion Höfle, a doctoral student in the research Multisensory Integration group led by Dr. Daniel Senkowski, at the Charité &#8211; Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shot1.jpg" rel="lightbox[5417]" title="Look away, shots hurt less"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5419" src="http://www.accessrx.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/shot1.jpg" alt="" width="100" height="150" /></a>Patients reported more pain and a more unpleasant feeling when they saw the needle before the injection. Researchers also noticed an autoimmune reaction, pupils dilated. This demonstrates that previous painful experiences with needles enhance unpleasantness of pain when viewing needle pricks.</p>
<p><strong>How this could change your doctor’s visit</strong></p>
<p>Researchers have deemed the “Don’t look” policy as sound advice, and with evidence backing the concept, they can attest that the old saying is acutally more than an old wives tale.</p>
