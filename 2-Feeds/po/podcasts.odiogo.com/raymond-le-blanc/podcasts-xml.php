<p>Mindset as a Powerful Tool For Success</p>
<p>Have you been struggling in work or in your personal life?  Do you keep trying but it seems like everything you do is a waste?  Are you starting to think that maybe success isn&#8217;t possible?</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m glad to say you&#8217;re wrong.  In fact, there&#8217;s a decent chance you&#8217;re already doing everything right.  The problem isn&#8217;t what you&#8217;re doing; it&#8217;s how you&#8217;re thinking.  If you want to achieve success, whether it&#8217;s at work, at school, at home, or while you&#8217;re playing minesweeper on the library computer, the key to achieving what you want is positive thinking.</p>
<p>Whether through genetics, or through learning from others around us, most of us have been programmed to think negatively about a situation.  We finish a project and instead of being excited, we are worried it&#8217;s not good enough or are already looking forward to the next project we haven&#8217;t finished yet.  Or we look in the mirror at ourselves and only see the flaws, not the good parts.  This thinking has permeated our lives.  While we think it may help us see problems, it also holds us back.  If all we see is negative, we become discouraged and are rarely successful.</p>
<p>As pretty much any successful person will tell you, the key to success is believing you will succeed.  This even extends farther.  The more positive your thoughts and attitudes, the more likely you are to do better.  This is why teachers are encouraged to put positive comments on papers even if a child does badly.  This is why businesses give recognition to employees who do well, because positive thinking works.</p>
<p>While this sounds like a great idea, we all know it&#8217;s not as easy as it seems.  If you&#8217;ve spent your life thinking negatively, it can be difficult to retrain your brain to look on the bright side.  Here are some tips for turning your mental frown upside down.</p>
<p>* Associate with positive people.  Have you ever noticed that when one person walks into the office in a really bad mood, everyone else eventually gets a little grumpier?  Attitudes, both positive and negative, are contagious.  While you can&#8217;t necessarily spend all your time with positive thinkers, or completely avoid the negative ones, you can try to budget your time and resources to be in more uplifting company.</p>
<p>* Surround yourself with positive words and images.  A few years back, there was a very popular poster of a kitten hanging in a precarious position that said ìhang in thereî.  While it may seem silly to most of us, this kind of tool can be very effective.  If cute and cuddly posters aren&#8217;t your thing, look up quotes, people, or images that you find inspiring and post them around your workspace.  They will provide you a constant stream of positivity throughout your day.</p>
<p>* Keep a list of positive accomplishments.  At the end of each day, make a list of things you&#8217;ve done that day or accomplishments you&#8217;ve reached.  It could be things you&#8217;ve gotten done that day, or other positive things like making a co-worker smile or having a good idea.  Just write down anything positive that happened or that you did.  This will help reinforce your positive thinking and energize you for tomorrow.</p>
<p>If you take even small steps to improve your thoughts, you&#8217;ll soon find success much easier to attain.  And even if things don&#8217;t go your way, don&#8217;t get discouraged - just keep it up.</p>

<p>Enhancing Your Conversation Skills</p>
<p>You meet people along the way, people you have very little in common with. Somehow, you find yourself occupying the same room, and then you&#8217;re forced to acknowledge that person. Making simple conversation can become very difficult. In fact, small talk doesn&#8217;t really amount to much, especially if it&#8217;s forced.</p>
<p>All of us intuitively know when we are about to have a difficult conversation with somebody. Yet, there are still a few of us who do not have any trouble striking up random conversations. Usually, difficulty happens when we know that there is a likely chance that negative feedback will occur. Some conversations may also seem difficult because we think that there are just too many things at stake. We have already taken a position wherein a retraction will lead to embarrassment. Which is why, it is important that we reflect on things before we put our foot in our mouths.</p>
<p>Below are a few guide questions we must ask ourselves before we get into a form of interaction:</p>
<p>1.    What do I want from this conversation?<br />
2.    What can I expect from it?<br />
3.    What sort of fears will crop up midway?<br />
4.    Am I making assumptions about the person I&#8217;m about to talk to?<br />
5.    Am I willing to listen and understand?</p>
<p>For interaction to be successful, we need to step out of the box and be objective about everything. There are so many things to talk about. You can start by asking about the person and his or her background. Move on from there and try not to put too much into it, otherwise things will just come out too contrived. If the person refuses to make any effort, then stop blaming yourself. After all, it takes two to tango.</p>
<p>People who refuse to open up are less likely to achieve popularity. You need to stop putting all the blame on you. When you meet people like this, all you need to do is nicely walk away. Say goodbye and move on to a more open individual.</p>
<p>You need to understand other people: what motivates them and how they think. More than that, you need to accurately read their <a class="zem_slink" title="Body language" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_language">body language</a>. People who are genuinely interested will look at you in the eye and listen to what you have to say. To be point-blank about reading a person&#8217;s thought needs practice. Get yourself out there and learn. After all, it is only through constant exposure will you learn the ins and outs of a situation. You also need to be in touch with yourself and your code of ethics. It takes practice to observe the dynamics between to people. Then, you need to have the courage to explore the community you live in. Culture plays a big part in forming a person&#8217;s frame of mind. Understand what that person believes in and what is important to them. The person will be more responsive if they feel that you sympathize with their beliefs. You need not embrace their principles, but at least you are willing to understand the why&#8217;s and what&#8217;s of it all.</p>
<p>The success of a dialogue is highly dependent on emotional awareness. When people see that you are trying to understand them and at the same time, give them unobstructed inputs of your views, then they will be more willing to get to know you more.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Motivational Speakers Should You Use Them at Work?</p>
<p>Are you having a lag in <a class="zem_slink" title="Productivity" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity">productivity</a>?  Does your workforce seem stressed out and in need of a mental boost?  You may be considering hiring a <a class="zem_slink" title="Motivational speaker" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivational_speaker">motivational speaker</a> to come put some of that zip and drive back into your employees.</p>
<p>Motivational speakers are people who are paid to come speak at your work.  You may use them just on their own, or as the key note speaker for a conference or team-building workshop.  They can be someone who has succeeded in business athletics or some other field, someone famous, or someone who is just really good at getting the best out of people.</p>
<p>If you find the right speaker, you will see a marked improvement not only in performance but also in general morale.  Instead of sitting around the water cooler gossiping or complaining about work and family, they&#8217;ll be talking about they&#8217;ve learned, coming up with new ideas, and lighting a fire under each other to get more accomplished.</p>
<p>In order to get the most out of a motivational speech, you need to find a speaker that meets the needs of your company or workforce.  While there are some problems that show up in almost every work environment, each workplace is unique.  If your workers are having problems because they aren&#8217;t working together, a speaker talking about finding motivation isn&#8217;t going to help much.  You have to tailor your solution to your problems.</p>
<p>In addition to increasing the productivity and morale of your workforce, if used properly, motivational speakers can also help promote your company and encourage new hires to want to come aboard.  Often you can take speakers and use their speeches for recruiting videos, and even as training videos for new hires.  They can also be used in materials for potential investors to show how you motivate your workers and emphasize your company philosophy.  Of course, use of the speech is something you need to check on with your potential speakers before you hire them.</p>
<p>The biggest con of hiring a motivational speaker at work is probably the money.  Depending on who you hire to come in, speakers&#8217; fees can go from reasonable to astronomical.  Not only will you have to pay their fees and sometimes expenses, you will also lose profit from lack of working during their speech.  And no speaker is going to guarantee a rise in productivity or profits after they&#8217;ve made their speech.</p>
<p>Even if a speaker does motivate your workforce and raise productivity, it&#8217;s probably not going to last forever.  The luster of a speech fades with time.  If you want to keep the boost going, you&#8217;re going to have to make a plan to continually remind people of the speaker (and this is hit and miss on whether it will work).</p>
<p>If you put thought and effort behind it, choose an appropriate speaker, and back up their presentation with further learning and support, you&#8217;re probably going to notice a big difference in your workers, and in your company as a whole.</p>

<p>Rely on Your Inner Strength</p>
<p>We all have to deal with stress. As you work your way towards success, there will always be hindrances. When problems arise, retreating is not always the answer. Giving up is the coward&#8217;s way out, and people ruled with fear will never achieve anything or amount to much. Stress is a part of life, and when you allow things to get out of control, you only make the situation worse. When you leave things be and focus your attention elsewhere, you are allowing the situation to win. Your life will be about avoiding issues, and nothing will ever get better. You have to sooner or later deal with it, and when you put off your responsibilities, you may one day find yourself overburdened with problems that are too tough to handle.</p>
<p>Do you want to spend half your life running away from things you fear? If you do this, then you are not living your life to the fullest. You are merely surviving. You will deny yourself from the true pleasures of life simply because you are trying to avoid trials. You won&#8217;t go anywhere and instead stagnate. Then you see the people around you living their dreams, while you are still at the bottom of the ladder. When you experience difficult days, you turn your back away and see that the problems have never actually disappeared. In fact, you merely threw a cloak over it and hid it for awhile. But things will always have a way of coming out, and when this happens, you will no longer have a chance to run away from it. You may then try to deal with it, but has already blown way out of proportion that there is no way of getting around it.</p>
<p>You now really need to find an immediate solution to controlling the situation and improving your circumstances. Do it now before it controls you. Although many of you regard stress as the enemy, there are ways to making it your friend. Quiet time is, without exception, the best way to clear up your head. You also have to trust in your abilities. When you find yourself in a predicament, you have to see it as a chance to strategize and prove to yourself and the people around you that you are more than capable of many things. Your experiences also play a big part in how you believe in your talents and capabilities.</p>
<p>We all have this inner critic that never changes. This stops us from seeing our true strengths and abilities. The key to moving forward and overcoming insecurities is to bring awareness to what you want and what you have achieved at present. Reclaim your self esteem and courage. Harness enough energy so that you can live through day to day experiences with a new zest for life. There is nothing you can&#8217;t achieve if you simply put your mind to it. You simply have to get up every time you fall. You may find yourself bruised and battered, but if you strive forth, you&#8217;ll be able to conquer any trial and win over it with a mind filled with wisdom.</p>
<p>One of life&#8217;s goals is to teach you a lesson, let you learn as you go through each and every experience. Gain more knowledge from it and apply what you&#8217;ve learned. Practice makes perfect, and if you keep at it, you&#8217;ll see that it gets easier along the way.</p>

<p>Because I know that my time is limited, I invest some of it in organization so I can be as productive as possible with the rest of it.</p>
<p>I let go of the idea that I can do everything and focus my attention on a few things that matter most to me. I prune out the rest in order to be able to do quality work on those things without stretching myself too far.</p>

<p>Because I am clear on where I am going, I find it natural to break down the steps I need to take to get there. I set realistic daily, weekly and yearly goals so I can accomplish what I set out to do in a reasonable manner.</p>
<p>I let go of the idea that I should be able to finish important projects overnight and, instead, give myself the time I need to do an exceptional job.</p>
<p>I often have many things that I need to remember: names, dates, times, tasks, opportunities, and much more. I utilize a planner and check it regularly because I know that by staying organized I am granting myself greater productivity and a more relaxed life.</p>
<p>Self-Reflection Questions:</p>
<p>1. Do I recognize the value of investing time in organization?<br />
2. Do I take advantage of tools that are designed to help me be organized?<br />
3. Are the activities that use up my time contributing to the achievement of my goals?</p>

      <description>While self-motivation is a simple concept, we all know that it's one of the hardest things to attain.  Despite purely good intentions, most of us are better at slacking off than getting motivated.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five Ways to Increase Self-Motivation</p>
<p>While self-motivation is a simple concept, we all know that it&#8217;s one of the hardest things to attain.  Despite purely good intentions, most of us are better at slacking off than getting motivated.  But, no matter what your attention span it is possible for you to motivate yourself and reach your goals; you just need to follow a few simple steps.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-209" title="self-motivation " src="http://raymondleblanc.me/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/107-calm-800x600-300x225.jpg" alt="self-motivation " width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>Know what you&#8217;re doing</p>
<p>A to-do list is nice to have to help you get things done, but it doesn&#8217;t do much to help you stay motivated.  Before you can make your to-do list, you need to set goals and priorities.  They may be short term like ìfinish this project to attain more workî or more general like ìincrease workload to attain promotionî.  If you give yourself a goal or vision to work for, you&#8217;re going to be more motivated to finish things than if you&#8217;re simply completing tasks.</p>
<p>Stay positive</p>
<p>A positive attitude can go a long way.  People have probably told you this over and over, but you&#8217;re still not inclined to believe it.  Take a little extra time each day to remind yourself of your accomplishments.  It is also a good idea to try to surround yourself with positive and encouraging people.  If you don&#8217;t have any at work, find positive and encouraging statements from successful people and post them around your office.</p>
<p>Set mini-goals</p>
<p>Finishing a project can be a daunting task.  If it&#8217;s a large amount of work, you&#8217;re likely to look at it, get overwhelmed, and give up or put it off before you even get started.  An easier way to accomplish a project is to break it up into smaller tasks.  This way you&#8217;ll be looking at a bunch of small goals instead of one great big one.  While it&#8217;s the same amount of work, it helps to keep you from getting overwhelmed.  Plus, each time you accomplish one of your tasks, you&#8217;ll feel successful and motivated to keep trekking on through the rest.</p>
<p>Reward yourself</p>
<p>To help keep yourself going, set up rewards for each task you complete.  They don&#8217;t have to be anything big; they could be going to see a movie over the weekend or spending 15 minutes on the phone with a friend you haven&#8217;t talked to in a while.  It&#8217;s just something positive to help encourage you.  You can also set small rewards for your mini goals and have a large reward for when you finish a large project.</p>
<p>You can also punish yourself to achieve goals.  For example, set up a mini-punishment, like snapping a rubber band on your wrist.  Every time you find yourself drifting off and not paying attention, or doing something counter-productive, snap the rubber band.  This will help train your mind to stay on track.</p>
<p>Have a backup</p>
<p>While we may have the best of intentions, most of us really aren&#8217;t that good at sticking with our self-motivating methods.  If this seems like you, you may be in need of some backup.  This is a friend, co-worker, or associate - anyone who is dependable and trustworthy.  Let them know what your goals are (and even your rewards and punishments) and set up a plan for them to check up on you.</p>
<p>It could be as simple as giving you a call to see how much you&#8217;ve gotten done, or maybe have them be the keeper of some reward and administer it when you reach your goal.  This way, if your resolution wavers, you&#8217;ll have someone else there to help out.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stop Being a People Pleaser</p>
<p>Some people just can&#8217;t help but go out of their way just to make other people happy. They do their best to bend over backwards just to give in to the demands of others, even if this means forgetting about their own needs along the way. When you become this kind of person, two things can happen: either you will annoy other people because you try to please others too much, or worse, you will meet people who want your friendship just to get favors.<a title="San Francisco Pride Parade 2009" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7516749@N07/3672382968/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2471/3672382968_4427b4aaae_m.jpg" border="0" alt="San Francisco Pride Parade 2009" width="160" height="240" /></a><br />

<p>Do you find yourself to be this kind of person at times? Have you hidden your true self in order to survive the peer pressure? These people pleasers are otherwise known as adapters. A lot of these people who were willing to let others use them were most likely raised in an environment where their opinions were not valued. Or they may have been neglected too often that they see themselves as an unimportant part of society. In order to earn their place, they mistakenly thought that they had to forget who they were just to bend to the will of others.</p>
<p>People pleasers focus mostly on others and not what is inside their own hearts and minds. If you become this kind of person, you will eventually feel lonely and empty deep down. You may have earned friends, but deep down, you will always doubt their real intentions. You will feel like there should be more to life and don&#8217;t exactly know what you are in search of. You need to get out of this unhealthy pattern. Know that it is very possible to change so that you can finally feel better about yourself and know what you truly deserve.</p>
<p>First off, you need to learn how to say NO. This very important word is what frees you from the chains you&#8217;ve created for your life. Say it as often as you can, just to hear the word come out of your mouth. Of course, you can also be more polite about it, but nonetheless, you have to know when to stop and put your own needs ahead. You may also feel guilty at times, but you&#8217;ll get to see who your real friends are in the very end.</p>
<p>Your state of mind is well worth the effort because when you have a healthy point of view, those around you will be healthy as well. Your thoughts and emotions are an important part of who you are. When you are unsure of yourself and try too hard to become the kind of person others want you to be, you&#8217;ll lose what matters most: your dignity and self-respect.</p>
<p>Many people pleasers wrongly believe that nobody will like them if they stop doing things for others. If someone stops liking you just because you&#8217;ve learned how to say no, then chances are they weren&#8217;t really your friends to begin with. A true friend is someone who likes you for your true self, someone who stands by you through thick and thin. Only when you become honest about whom you truly are will you have this kind of friendship.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t allow yourself to become anyone&#8217;s puppet. Free yourself from the fear of rejection because ironically, it is only then will you become loved and accepted. Who is running your life? The answer should be you!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gaining Self-Confidence</p>
<p>Some believe that in order to get everything that you desire most in life, you need money. Though a lot of things in this world can be acquired with the help of some cash, there are other ways for you to achieve your dreams. Money is not the means to an end, it is merely a reward when you have self-<a class="zem_slink" title="Confidence" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence">confidence</a>. If you have all the material possessions but don&#8217;t believe in your abilities, these things will be useless and worthless. Self confidence comes from knowing that you have the skills needed to achieve any goal you want. Even the most capable mind won&#8217;t amount to much without the self-confidence. It forms a base on which every structure rests, it is what keeps the things around you upright, and more importantly, it is what gives you the energy to move forward and pursue your dreams. <a title="River of Sorrow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16230215@N08/2592704701/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3118/2592704701_1c14e5157f_m.jpg" border="0" alt="River of Sorrow" width="240" height="162" /></a></p>
<p>The good thing about self confidence is that it can get passed to the people you&#8217;ll encounter. A person who knows that he can do anything that he wants gets the respect of everyone around. He will also be the inspiration for others to follow in his footsteps because it seems as if the universe itself decided to shine on that man&#8217;s fate. In today&#8217;s competitive world, self confidence is a basis of survival. In turn, that man draws more energy from his surroundings. This energy makes you a better person. This is an upward spiral that only gets better by the moment!</p>
<p>One can never predict what happens in their future, and in order to overcome unexpected hurdles, you need to develop confidence in yourself. You should always see life as a chance to know what you need to work on so that you can become a better person. This takes a lot of practice. After all, Rome wasn&#8217;t built in a day. To become a more confident person, you need to keep practicing the following:<small><a title="Attribution-NoDerivs License" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/" target="_blank"><img src="http://raymondleblanc.me/wp-content/plugins/photo-dropper/images/cc.png" border="0" alt="Creative Commons License" width="16" height="16" align="absmiddle" /></a> <a href="http://www.photodropper.com/photos/" target="_blank">photo</a> credit: <a title="h.koppdelaney" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/16230215@N08/2592704701/" target="_blank">h.koppdelaney</a></small></p>
<p>1.    Stop worrying about the opinions of other people. Never allow others to make you feel like the lesser person. The opinion you should value the most is your own. Just keep your eye on your destination and hold your head up high as you see yourself slowly climbing up the ladder of success.</p>
<p>2.    Learn from your mistakes and use life&#8217;s lessons as your weapon. You need to take responsibility for the choices that you&#8217;ve made and never fail to strategize based on your experience.</p>
<p>3.    Have faith. This keeps you determined to keep on and put all your energy into achieving what you want most from life simply because you know that it will happen if you just never give up.</p>
<p>We all have our own strengths and weaknesses. We can all excel by sticking to our principles. We also have to know that we can&#8217;t always win in every game we play, but this shouldn&#8217;t stop us from our mission. The secret to success is to be brave enough to face the unknown. Trust in yourself and know that with self-confidence, you can overcome problems and go further than you&#8217;ve ever expected.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to Eliminate Distractions that Detract from Your Day</p>
<p>Distractions get in the way every day, keeping you from being as productive as you might like. These distractions come in many forms, from ringing doorbells and telephones, to emails and voicemails. It can be a real challenge to stay focused!</p>
<p>How do you go about disregarding all these disturbances to get any work done? It can be tough, but there are ways to reduce the interruptions.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies you can use to control your distractions:</p>
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="margin: 1em; display: block;">
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 190px"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Facebook.png"><img title="Facebook's new homepage features a login form ..." src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/55/Facebook.png/300px-Facebook.png" alt="Facebook's new homepage features a login form ..." width="180" height="94" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image via Wikipedia</p></div>
</div>
<p>1. Telephone distractions. Unless you&#8217;re expecting an important call, turn off your ringers and direct your calls to voicemail. Then only check your voicemail once or twice a day.</p>
<p>* Return the calls you must, but if you can reply via email, that&#8217;s even better. When you send an email reply, you can keep the conversation succinct.</p>
<p>2. Email interruptions. Unsubscribe from email lists you don&#8217;t need and set up separate email accounts for business and pleasure. This way, when you&#8217;re trying to work, you don&#8217;t find yourself bombarded with jokes, videos, party invites, or <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> messages.</p>
<p>* Reduce the frequency emails are delivered to your inbox or set your email so you only receive emails when you go in and manually retrieve them in batches.</p>
<p>3. The World Wide Web time drain. If you don&#8217;t need the internet for your work, stay away from it. You&#8217;ll save yourself a lot of wasted time.</p>
<p>* Fully close web browsers so you eliminate the temptation to surf online.</p>
<p>4. Co-workers. If you find that co-workers annoy you, try wearing headphones while you work to give the illusion you can&#8217;t hear them. It might sound silly, but it eliminates being subjected to endless babble.</p>
<p>* Another option is to post a <a class="zem_slink" title="Do Not Disturb (telecommunications)" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Disturb_%28telecommunications%29">Do Not Disturb</a> sign outside of your workspace. Hopefully, your co-workers will know that you mean business and honor it.</p>
<p>5. Work space clutter. Get rid of any visual clutter - it&#8217;s distracting and kills productivity. Seeing unfinished projects or pending work can cause unnecessary stress. This stress can have negative results, like making you unable to focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>* Put everything you don&#8217;t need for your current project into a drawer or box out of sight if you have to. You can always sort it out carefully when you&#8217;re less busy.</p>
<p>* The same should be said for computer clutter. Eliminate unneeded computer programs and icons to make your computer more efficient. The quicker you&#8217;re able to find the file you need, the faster you&#8217;ll be able to get back on track.</p>
<p>6. Work-at-home distractions. If you work from home, make sure friends and family respect the fact that you&#8217;re truly working just like anyone who goes into an office. Some people may have a difficult time understanding this concept, but they&#8217;ll comply if you explain it.</p>
<p>* Avoid doing household chores during your work time. Train your mind to think about these tasks when your work is finished.</p>
<p>When distractions do arise, whether at home or at the office, make notes and deal with them at an appropriate time at the end of the day. If someone pops by to chat, stand up to let them know your chatting time is limited. Don&#8217;t allow them to sit or get cozy.</p>
<p>Of course, you still need to set aside time to handle these distractions. You don&#8217;t want to be so restrictive on yourself that you burn out. After all, everyone benefits from a little guilt-free downtime! It&#8217;s okay to let your mind wander, browse the web, or do whatever appeals to you, just make sure it doesn&#8217;t creep into your work time.</p>
<p>Follow these tips every day to make effective use of your time and energy. When you eliminate distractions, you&#8217;ll find that you can get more done in half the time!</p>

<p>Controlling Your Mind</p>
<p>How can you control your thoughts? If you find it hard to stop yourself from thinking about something, then this is an extremely difficult task to do. You can constantly tell yourself to stop acting on a thought, but to actually stop thinking about something, now that&#8217;s another story altogether. Your thoughts are more powerful than you&#8217;ll know. When you constantly think about something, you&#8217;re veering your life towards that direction. You pattern your actions according to what is on your mind. Therefore, if you constantly have a negative attitude towards everything, you&#8217;ll end up being known as the person with a dour disposition. Not a pleasant thought now, is it?</p>
<p>The skill of being able to control your mind is simply an act of constant practice. Much like your health, you frequently need exercise to attain your ideal weight. This is not something that can be done overnight. After all, it requires a change of your outlook in life and a readjustment of your personality. Whenever an unwanted thought comes to your mind, simply stop yourself from thinking about it any further. Then, you have to shift your focus elsewhere. Watching television or reading a book helps greatly especially if you need to stop it immediately. Some people believe that making oneself tired from thinking about an unwanted thought helps a lot in kicking the habit. What this means is that you have to come up with a mode of punishment every single time you do something that goes against your ultimate goal. Try this, whenever you find yourself thinking about something unpleasant, mark it on a piece of paper. Mount the paper on a wall and go to it every time you break your word. You&#8217;ll soon find it a great inconvenience whenever you have to stand up, walk over to that piece of paper to mark it. This, of course, is not an easy task, but it will give you the extra boost you&#8217;ll need to actually make an effort.</p>
<p>Remember, all your problems last only as long as you allow them. Yes, getting rid of your negative thoughts requires a lot of patience, but if you actually make the effort to change your way of thinking, you&#8217;ll soon find yourself being the master of your thoughts and of your emotions. Many of the successful people have done this. In fact, they have attained their goals in life simply because they were able to shift their focus to something more productive.</p>
<p>So, take control of your mind. Stop focusing and dwelling on your problems and on the pain that others have inflicted on you. It&#8217;s time to love yourself above all else and acknowledge where you are in your life at this very moment. Refuse to think about the past and plan for your future. After all, your future is what you make of it. As long as you go through things with a positive thought in your mind, your future can be as happy as you want it to be. You are who you think you are and you will be who you will yourself to be. Think about it!</p>

<p>Dissolving Past Pain and Moving Forward in Your Life</p>
<p>Have you ever been hurt so badly that you thought you&#8217;d never come out on the other side? Perhaps you&#8217;re still holding onto that grief. If you are, then it&#8217;s time to learn how to let go of past pain. You deserve to let it go and learn how to move forward with your life.</p>
<p>Holding onto past pain and anguish is a kind of self-inflicted torture that can cause serious health risks as well as emotional scarring. The truth is, when you cling to the past, you&#8217;re internally changing your present.</p>
<p>How can something you&#8217;ve kept inside for so long just be let go? It&#8217;s not an easy task, but it can be done with a little effort and self-reflection.</p>
<p>Here are some ways you can let go of past pain and disappointment, so you can move forward with your head held high:</p>
<p>1. Know what&#8217;s holding you back. What are you holding onto and why? Identify the things you&#8217;re keeping inside that you shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>* For example, maybe your best friend betrayed you in a way that broke your trust. Recognize this and figure out a way to finally deal with it. Get in touch with them again, then explain the pain they&#8217;ve caused.</p>
<p>* They may not even be aware they did anything to upset you. Whether or not they apologize isn&#8217;t important. While it may be nice, you can&#8217;t control others or force them to say sorry. However, by simply voicing your feelings, you are finding closure from the hurtful situation.</p>
<p>* Getting closure on something that was left open-ended can make a huge difference in letting things go.</p>
<p>2. Talk it out. If the person who caused the hurt is still in your life, talk to them about the way they made you feel. If that person isn&#8217;t available, try to talk to a close friend or professional therapist about the situation.</p>
<p>* Getting your emotions out in the open can help you get over any resentment or anger you may be feeling. Bottling up your emotions is never a good thing. Let it all out in a constructive way and you&#8217;ll be amazed at how much better you&#8217;ll feel.</p>
<p>3. Forgive and forget. It may sound easier said than done, but forgiving someone who has hurt you can be extremely therapeutic. Strive to let things stay in the past and don&#8217;t allow them to affect your present.</p>
<p>* Once you learn to forgive the people who&#8217;ve caused your pain, you will find it far easier to heal and move on with your life.</p>
<p>4. Make the first move. You&#8217;re in charge of your pain. You&#8217;re the one who carries it around with you and you&#8217;re the only one who can change its intensity. It&#8217;s up to you to take control of the pain and take the first step towards making yourself feel better.</p>
<p>* Acknowledge that your pain is real and that a positive solution exists.</p>
<p>* Confront the cause of the pain and do everything in your power to get rid of it.</p>
<p>The best way to move forward is to forgive the past. If you can&#8217;t change the past, you might as well learn to accept it and move on. You&#8217;ll be glad you did once you see just how bright your future can be when you regain control of your life.</p>
<p>Make the conscious decision, today, to live your life free from pain and resentment.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seven Simple Tips to Stay on Task</p>
<p>Do you have a difficult time staying on task? If you feel as though you&#8217;re spending a whole day just trying to get started, while never actually getting anything done, you can do something about it!</p>
<p>There are some very simple ways to help you regain your focus and stay on task, no matter what the day brings. In fact, some of these strategies are so simple that you may question whether they really are effective. The truth is, the simplest of strategies often yields the greatest result.</p>
<p>Here are seven simple tips you can use to help you stay on task:</p>
<p>1. Keep a list. Create a daily task list on paper for your whole day or week. If you think creating a list in your mind is just as effective, think again. The truth is, you&#8217;re more likely to waste precious time just trying to remember what&#8217;s ahead!</p>
<p>* When you take the time to create a list, you&#8217;re giving yourself a visual confirmation of what&#8217;s next. When you have a list to refer to, there&#8217;s no arguing what comes next and you won&#8217;t have any excuse to stray from your plan.</p>
<p>2. Schedule time for meetings and events. Set up specific times when people can come in and interrupt your work. Let your co-workers know what works for you and strive to stick to it as much as possible.</p>
<p>* For example, it&#8217;s often helpful if your co-workers know they need to leave you alone for two or three hours in the morning, but then after that they can come in and ask questions or get advice from you as needed.</p>
<p>3. Refuse to check email every five seconds. If you interrupt your workday by checking your email too frequently, you can get side tracked just as you are building momentum. Set specific times when you check email. It could be twice a day, or every few hours, but the goal is to eliminate unnecessary distractions.</p>
<p>* You can also send an automated reply that explains when you check email and when the sender should expect a response. I&#8217;m sure people can wait a few hours for a response!</p>
<p>4. Keep off of <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Twitter" rel="homepage" href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and instant messaging services. Sure, communicating with your friends and colleagues can make the day go faster, but it distracts you from the task at hand and keeps you from building precious momentum.</p>
<p>* How can you possibly get anything done when you&#8217;re immersed in a real-time Twitter conversation? You can&#8217;t. So turn it off and go back on when it&#8217;s the right time for you.</p>
<p>5. Use headphones to block out noise. If you have trouble focusing on your work because of the noise around you, wear a pair of noise-canceling headphones. If you don&#8217;t want any sound at all, get some earplugs; it&#8217;ll save your sanity!</p>
<p>6. Get a comfortable chair. Did you know that productivity and comfort go hand-in-hand? It&#8217;s true. Having a comfortable chair makes a huge difference in how you think, feel, and perform. If a new chair is out of the budget, get one of those chair cushions. You&#8217;ll find that it&#8217;s a purchase that pays for itself.</p>
<p>7. Clean up your workspace. When your desk is clean and organized, it&#8217;s much easier to stay focused on the task at hand. Why? Because you don&#8217;t have to wade through the stacks and clutter to find what you need.</p>
<p>* Even seeing the piles of junk in your peripheral vision may increase your internal tension! Keep only what you need for your current task and put everything else in its place.</p>
<p>Do you think you can implement some of these simple tips in your workflow? I know you can!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll experience a huge difference in your productivity and - more importantly - your happiness, when you apply even just a few of these time-saving techniques. You&#8217;ll be able to get more done faster than ever, leaving you with time for more important things, like having fun!</p>

<p>Improving Team Performance through Team-Building Weekends</p>
<p>Are you losing productivity at work?  Are your employees having trouble getting along or finishing projects collaboratively?  If so, it might be a good idea to set up a team-building weekend.  This can help motivate your team and get them out of a slump.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to decide is where you will hold your retreat.  While it might be easier and more cost-effective to hold it at your workplace, your team will probably be more receptive to coming into work on a weekend if it&#8217;s somewhere a little more appealing.  Also, you&#8217;ll probably want to add some fun activities to your weekend and this is easier to do when you&#8217;re out and about.</p>
<p>Once you find a location, you can start planning activities for your group to do.  You can find countless books and resources with activities.  You can also find many ideas on the internet that you can use.</p>
<p>Be sure to target your team-building exercises specifically to your group&#8217;s needs.  If your team has communication issues, work on that.  If they have trouble with trust and working together, find activities that focus on those issues.  Knowing your group members individually and as a whole will help to tailor the outing to suit their needs.  It&#8217;s also going to make activities easier to find if you&#8217;re searching for ìcommunication-building activitiesî rather than sifting through the thousands of ideas that appear for ìteam-building activitiesî.</p>
<p>While team-building activities are great for your goals, it is also important to set aside some time during your retreat to start putting your newfound skills and knowledge to use.  This is a great time to talk about grievances in a productive manner, work on individual and group goals, and to make needed changes and updates to the way your office operates.</p>
<p>You also need to make sure there&#8217;s some fun involved in your weekend retreat.  It might be that you choose more exciting team-building activities, rather than ones that will make you break down crying.  It could also mean scheduling fun activities that go in between your more work-intensive sessions.  Just make sure your employees&#8217; eyes aren&#8217;t glazing over.</p>
<p>Once your team-building weekend is over, that doesn&#8217;t mean your team building should be.  If you really want your progress to be successful, you need to have a follow-up plan.  This can help continue building a sense of community, but will also keep your group from backtracking (which, without a doubt, they will do without a follow-up plan).  This could be something big, like taking regular time out to have more exercises and group outings, or something simple like having team members give each other positive notes on a regular basis.</p>
<p>It is also important to add some way to evaluate whether your weekend was effective.  This will help you plan events in the future and let you know what is working and what needs changing.</p>
<p>If done right, team-building retreats can be a great way to improve teamwork and results.</p>

<p>How to Schedule In Me-Time</p>
<p>Being a mom and an entrepreneur means there&#8217;s very little, if any, time for you to simply spend time on yourself ñ there&#8217;s very little me time.  However it&#8217;s the me time that keeps us smiling when our two year old uses a sharpie marker on the white walls or the sixteen year old crashes the car into the garage.  It&#8217;s the me time that keeps us sane and able to manage life&#8217;s little challenges.  Here are a few tips to make sure you schedule time for yourself:</p>
<p>#1  Add it to your schedule.  That sounds like a given, right?  Yet many people skip this step.  They schedule dentist appointments but not time for themselves. Seems quite backwards really, why on earth would you prefer having holes drilled in your head over a day at the spa, a good book in a park or lunch with your friends?  One great way to make sure you schedule me-time into your life is to make it a commitment.  For example, go out to lunch with friends, make a spa or massage appointment or hire a babysitter to watch the children.  This way, you&#8217;re committing to someone else as well, the massage therapist, your friends, etc and you&#8217;ll be less likely to back out.</p>
<p>#2  Make it routine.  When something becomes a habit, part of our normal routine and lifestyle, we&#8217;re more likely to do it and more likely to miss it if you skip it.  Creating regular me time whether it is daily or weekly is a great way to make and keep a commitment to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>#3  Partner up.  If you know other moms who are also entrepreneurs then they too are probably looking for a little me time.  Consider partnering with them for childcare. For example if there is a painting class you&#8217;d like to take on Wednesday mornings and she has a weekly massage on Friday afternoons, you can swap and watch each other&#8217;s children.</p>
<p>#4  Ask your family for help.  Partners and children don&#8217;t know you need me time unless you tell them.  However it pays to create a plan in advance.  Simply bursting at a stressful moment and screaming that you don&#8217;t get enough time to yourself is only going to hurt feelings. Instead, create a plan of action and present it to your family asking for their support.</p>
<p>#5  Learn to say no to others and yes to yourself. There&#8217;s always something else that needs to be done.  Always.  Learn to say no and to prioritize your tasks, keeping in mind that you are always top priority.</p>
<p>Children learn from our example. This makes self care important for your mental and physical health and it teaches your child how to take good care of themselves today and when they&#8217;re an adult.</p>

<p>Courage and Resilience</p>
<p>Courage is defined as the ability to face fears with our heads held high. It is not the absence of trepidation that we can truly say that we are brave. In fact, people experience fear everyday, and sometimes are even paralyzed by it. We are allowed to feel all these things. In fact, we should! Otherwise, we wouldn&#8217;t be human if we were immune to the many types of emotions. It does not require sacrificing our lives all of the time. In fact, we all have the makings of a real hero, and in our own little ways, we can show that we are willing to face all the trials that life throws in our way.</p>
<p>The opportunity to be courageous is inside us all and we are given many opportunities where we can practice this. We sometimes do everything to avoid these uncomfortable situations. As we face the Goliath of our inner David, we get scared of the unknown and of the possibility that we will lose. We can&#8217;t help but flinch and run away.<br />
That is why, in times like these we need to know that there are things around us that can help us. We have to know that we all have the innate ability to summon all our strength and stand our ground.</p>
<p>Here are just a few tips that may help us along the way:</p>
<p>1.    We have to know what we have. Fear can rule us and paralyze us if we let it. Then, instead of facing something manageable, we face a puffed up illusion of the fear. We have to realize that we always have someone to lean on. Pray and ask the people in our lives to help us through the ordeal, no matter how small or big it is. Our insecurities may be huge in our minds that this can seem insurmountable, but the only way we can overcome them is to face them and push ourselves towards them. We have people we can count on. This is not to say that we forgo all our responsibilities and let them handle all of it. We have to know that we still must go through it, but a hand to hold makes a world of difference.</p>
<p>2.    We need to learn to discover what&#8217;s beyond our comfort zone. When we have to confront something, it takes an element of risk into the unknown. If there are risks involved, it does mean we have to let go of it simply because we do not know what to do. The more we confront the fear, the easier it becomes in our lives. The risk of threat is always around. If we always give up, we will digress and destroy our lives. What will make us stronger is our ability to always get up every time we fall.</p>
<p>3.    We need to face life with optimism. We have to know that there are just things that are beyond our control. Accept these things and change the way we respond to the situation. Instead of it bringing us down, we must find ways to make it work to our advantage. This takes practice, but once we are able to alter our attitude, we will see that life does not throw us problems that we can&#8217;t handle.</p>
<p>Courage and resilience go hand in hand because it brings healthy growth. Nature has gifted us with the ability to adapt. It is now up to us to discover how to use it.</p>

      <description>Getting more done with less time is somewhat of an art. The task requires much heart, but you must keep in mind that working smart comes before everything else. Burning the midnight oil at some point can be detrimental to your health. If you lack sleep and are fatigued with all the demands placed on you, your work may suffer. How do you expect to focus when you're too tired to do anything else?

<p>The Difference between Working Hard and Working Smart</p>
<p>Some claim that they are one of the best workers in their industry simply because of the hours they put in for work. I happen to somewhat disagree with this. To an extent, you do have to dedicate time for work. In the end, however, it is the quality of your work that people look at rather that the hours of service you gave.</p>
<p>Getting more done with less time is somewhat of an art. The task requires much heart, but you must keep in mind that working smart comes before everything else. Burning the midnight oil at some point can be detrimental to your health. If you lack sleep and are fatigued with all the demands placed on you, your work may suffer. How do you expect to focus when you&#8217;re too tired to do anything else?</p>
<p>Yes, working hard reaps a lot of rewards, but experience tells me that the best way to achieve success is to work hard at working smart. How do you do this? First, you have to be more flexible. Changes come in everyday, and sometimes, in the middle of the project, you may find that you will have to change a lot of the things. Instead of whining and complaining, know that this comes with the territory. Grown-ups deal with it every day, and being a grown-up yourself, you have to be gracious at accepting everything.</p>
<p>Another problem would be is that people do tend to procrastinate. I am guilty of it myself, but I&#8217;ve also had to learn my lesson the hard way. The more I put off, the higher my pile of responsibilities gets. If you do this, you definitely will end up disappointing more people than pleasing them. That is why it is also important to plan ahead. Elaborate in the steps to take and take it easy. Haste makes waste! The more you panic, the messier your output becomes.</p>
<p>Simply observe your colleagues and you will notice that those who are most successful are those who are able to multi-task and balance their responsibilities. Juggling several things all at one time does not have to be confusing. You just have to know which of these tasks go together so that you are not left bewildered.</p>
<p>Double the time does not necessarily mean double the result. This is an act of practicing to perfect the habit. It helps to update yourself on the recent technological advances as well. These machineries were invented to make work easier on man. Know which program works best for you and avoid stressing yourself with things that are just way too confusing. The good thing about today&#8217;s developments is that designers have made software simpler and easier to use. These so-called inventors know that this is what everybody needs and have therefore designed programs that were better to understand.</p>
<p>To succeed, and achieve higher plateaus, requires that we constantly have to strategize. You will find that communication has given you easy access to reading materials that will help you achieve your goal.<br />
Read up and learn. In the end, you&#8217;ll realize just how much you&#8217;ve learned and how it is quite simple to put the theories into good practice.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Speed Reading Tips and Tricks</p>
<p>Speed reading is a much sought after skill that enables you to boost your reading speed, while also improving your comprehension.</p>
<p>Speed reading strengthens your ability to read any style of writing while still understanding the intended and deeper meaning.</p>
<p>For example, when speed reading, you&#8217;ll be able to skim right over the less vital pieces of information and pick out the sections which are more important far quicker than by using traditional reading techniques.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re already a fast reader or not, once you start training yourself to speed read, you&#8217;ll notice your reading rate and retention will vastly improve over time.</p>

<p>Just like anything else, when learning how to read more quickly, you can&#8217;t expect to read faster overnight. To learn how to use this skill properly requires time, effort and practice. You&#8217;ll need to work at speed reading every day in order to become proficient.</p>
<p>Here are some effective techniques you can use to teach yourself to speed read:</p>
<p>1. Time yourself. When you first begin, time your current reading pace so you&#8217;ll have a baseline that you can use for comparisons. Time yourself often when reading to see your growing improvement.</p>
<p>2. Practice improving your speed. Try and force yourself to read a little faster each time you pick up the material. You can do this by skipping over common words like the, to, from, and, etc.</p>
<p>3. Read each and every day. If you only read when you feel like it, you can&#8217;t possibly improve. Work a little bit each day, otherwise you may find yourself having to backtrack and relearn skills all over again.</p>
<p>* Go to the library and grab plenty of books to practice with.<br />
* Take time each day to sit down and practice quickly reading a chapter or two, then test your retention by paraphrasing what you read.</p>
<p>4. Learn good reading habits. Work to break yourself of habits that slow your reading down, such as sub-vocalizing words, which is pronouncing words to yourself or moving your lips when reading. Be sure you&#8217;re only saying the words in your head.</p>
<p>5. Read with your hand. Moving your hand down the page helps guide your eyes quickly through the material.</p>
<p>6. Avoid re-reading. Practice taking away understanding of your material the first time you read it.</p>
<p>* You can skim through the information from time to time if needed, but avoid re-reading it in depth if you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<p>7. Read in blocks of words. Instead of reading words letter by letter or the information word by word, interpret the author&#8217;s ideas in blocks of words.</p>
<p>8. Avoid distractions. Interruptions can interfere with your capability and cause confusion.</p>
<p>* You may want to try reading in the morning or before you go to sleep, when there are likely to be fewer distractions.</p>
<p>Before you can speed read, you first have to make the commitment to continually refine your skills. Practicing speed reading will help you improve your reading, writing and comprehension. As you strengthen your speed reading skills, you&#8217;ll soon find that you enjoy reading and learning new things more than ever!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top Five Computer Tips to Get More Done in Less Time</p>
<p>Do you wish you could be more productive at your computer? There&#8217;s good news! There are some things you can do that will allow you to get more done in less time.</p>
<p>You may be surprised at how simple these strategies are, how little some of them have to do with your computer, and how much they have to do with organization!</p>
<p>Here are the top five computer strategies to get more done in less time:</p>
<div class="zemanta-img zemanta-action-dragged" style="margin: 1em; display: block;">

<p>1. De-clutter. One of the simplest computer strategies is having a clean workspace. When most of us think of our computer, we think of the actual machine, but did you know that the space around your computer is as important as the computer itself?</p>
<p>* When you keep your computing space as tidy as possible, you can get more done because you won&#8217;t be distracted by stopping to &#8220;clear a path&#8221; as you work.</p>
<p>* De-cluttering also means removing old software and files that are taking up too much space. You&#8217;ll be surprised how much speedier the machine will feel when you&#8217;ve cleared all the junk off your computer!</p>
<p>2. Run anti-virus software every day. Viruses can slow down your computer or worse. Obviously if your computer is unresponsive, you&#8217;ll lose precious time during your workday.</p>
<p>* Running anti-virus software will help you make sure your computer is running at its very best so you don&#8217;t lose momentum by waiting for a document to open.</p>
<p>* You&#8217;ll also prevent things like hard drive crashes and data loss. So run anti-virus software on your PC or get a Mac.</p>
<p>3. Organize. A little observed, but very effective, computer strategy is to organize your files and folders in such a way that everything you need is within reach. This way, you can move seamlessly from one task to another without wasting time searching for files.</p>
<p>* Put commonly used files in one place, such as your Documents folder. Also, use full filenames so you can easily find what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>* Use a search tool like Google Desktop on the PC or Spotlight on the Mac to easily find files not within reach.</p>
<p>4. Clean the desktop on your computer. Many people don&#8217;t give much thought to their desktop and they may have dozens of unused icons and downloads just taking up space. Keep only the files, folders, and programs you need on your desktop.</p>
<p>* Delete the icons you don&#8217;t use regularly so that you can find what you&#8217;re looking for quicker.</p>
<p>5. Learn the shortcuts. Set a goal to learn something new about the software tools you use the most. There are plenty of options hidden in menus and keyboard shortcuts that can save you time, energy, and sanity.</p>
<p>* Print out a list of common shortcuts and keep it beside your computer for easy reference. When you challenge yourself to learn these new tricks, you&#8217;ll get faster and more productive over time.</p>
<p>These are all very simple computer strategies that will help you be more efficient and productive. When you incorporate even one of these strategies into your daily routine, you&#8217;ll find that you truly can get more done in less time.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Being the Best of Who You Can Be</p>
<p>The word best is relative. Some people think that they become better people when they&#8217;ve climbed the ladder of success and reached the top. Some, on the other hand, believe that a happy family life will make them the best that they can be. The word is actually dependent on your aspirations in life. Admittedly, we all have different goals, and some of these goals may be harder to attain than the others.</p>
<p>Whatever our dreams are, we have to know that we only get better when we become stronger. Becoming better, whether physically, spiritually, or mentally, will, in turn, all depend on how we are as a person.</p>
<p>To start with, we have <a title="#16 :: 16th January 2009" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/56507475@N00/3202468868/" target="_blank"><img class="alignright" style="border: 0pt none;" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3264/3202468868_4251c3c2ec_m.jpg" border="0" alt="#16 :: 16th January 2009" width="144" height="144" /></a><br />

We all have different talents and we need to know what our niche in life is so we can work on it. Our life&#8217;s experiences have shaped who we&#8217;ve become, and because we have different experiences, we all have unique talents and abilities. Someone who grew up in squalor may say that they have become more street-smart, a successful person may boast of his business abilities, and a mother may say that she is quite adept at balancing her time at work and with her family. Whatever it is, we&#8217;ve learned to cope with life because we simply had to. And in our efforts to meet all the demands placed on us, we had to learn the ways in which we can meet the expectations that others have of us.</p>
<p>The problem is that many people don&#8217;t want to accept who they are and what they&#8217;ve become. They sometimes let their past affect them, as if they were ashamed of the very thing that helped them become the person that they are. Living in shame is not a way to becoming our ultimate selves. If we do, we will spend our lives trying to hide our true nature. That&#8217;s simply no way to live!</p>
<p>We must know that there are just things we cannot change. These things should teach us to be proud of whom we are. After all, when we go through great misery, we come out of it filled with wisdom. We must share our story, because at least we can say that we had it in us to succeed despite the things that happened to us. We should be proudest of the things that we were once ashamed of. I assure you, people will see us with respect. They will know us as a person who can do it. This is the greatest gift we can share.</p>
<p>Take a look at the world around you and get to know the most successful individuals out there. You&#8217;ll soon learn that many of them were once selfish individuals. They&#8217;ve become who they are because they learned from their mistakes, and they shared these mistakes with people so that others may learn from it. They&#8217;ve become the unselfish gurus who thirst to give guidance to those who want to become as successful as they are. They&#8217;ve earned the respect of millions of people, and we all could be just like them if we learn to accept our mistakes and share our talents to those who need it. If things just worked this way, only then can we truly say that it&#8217;s a wonderful world.</p>

<p>Top 5 Ways to Be Assertive and Confident</p>
<p>Self-help books fly off the shelves of bookstores. They&#8217;re the most common books on request at libraries. From business people to housewives, people are looking for ways to improve their lives, and the most sought after self-help books are those on how to be assertive and confident.</p>
<p>During job interviews, potential employers look for essential qualities in prospective employees. Assertiveness and confidence are high on the list. People we admire in the business world are often seen as confident and assertive.</p>
<p>To achieve goals in life, these are two valuable character traits. While some people seem to be born assertive and confident, the rest of us can learn these coveted characteristics.</p>
<p>Here are the top 5 ways to become assertive and confident:</p>
<p>1. Overcome shyness. Shyness can range from healthy to overwhelming and debilitating. Shyness is not the same as having low self-esteem. Many shy people have a very positive image of themselves, but they lack assertiveness and confidence. If you&#8217;re shy, you can practice these techniques to overcome your shyness:</p>
<p>* Visualization. Positively visualize situations and circumstances before experiencing them. This will give you a better &#8220;what if&#8221; scenario, and help you be better prepared for any variation.</p>
<p>* Practice speaking. People who are shy often dislike the sound of their own voices. Practicing speeches in front of a mirror or with trusted friends will help you gain the confidence you need.</p>
<p>* Reinforce the positive. This is a way of thinking yourself out of being shy. By using affirmations to assert your positive characteristics, you can convince yourself that you are brilliant and worthy of great things. After all, sometimes the hardest person to convince is you!</p>
<p>2. Learn the difference between being aggressive and assertive. People respond better to an assertive person rather than an aggressive person.</p>
<p>* Aggressive people are seen as bullies who approach a problem with harsh criticism. They would say someone is doing a project &#8220;all wrong,&#8221; for example.</p>
<p>* An assertive person, on the other hand, approaches the same situation with concerns and ideas to improve the project.</p>
<p>* Your goal should be to approach people with positive attitudes and solutions to problems. If you respect others and treat them as you want to be treated, you&#8217;ll have the same courtesy returned to you.</p>
<p>3. Become informed. One of the best methods of being assertive and confident is to know your subject matter. No matter what the situation is, the more you know, the more confident you&#8217;ll be.</p>
<p>* It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s a job interview or a presentation to your peers, knowing what you&#8217;re speaking about will give you that aura of confidence you desire.</p>
<p>* Be prepared for potential questions on your subject matter. A good idea is to have a trusted coworker help you identify common questions and answers. You will gain confidence in front of others when you first brainstorm and practice with someone you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>4. Speak up. Speak with confidence even if you don&#8217;t feel confident. Practice speaking this way. The more you practice the more it will become second nature.</p>
<p>5. Model your behavior after people you admire. Chances are the people you admire have the assertiveness and confidence you&#8217;re looking for in your own life.</p>
<p>* Observe how they do things.</p>
<p>* Pay attention to what they say and how they say it.</p>
<p>* Watch their body language.</p>
<p>Studying people who have the traits you crave is one of the best ways to create those very same traits in yourself.</p>
<p>Learning to be confident and assertive can enable you to achieve your goals with ease, whatever they may be. Practicing these and other methods will put you on the right track to success.</p>
<p>First and foremost, you must believe in yourself and your abilities. Keep in mind that some of our greatest leaders didn&#8217;t start out assertive and confident. George Washington was too shy to talk to people growing up. He changed his ways, and so can you!</p>

<p>Managing Stress on Busy Days</p>
<p>Feeling like a lead weight is on your shoulders is probably a very common feeling. With the busy lives we lead, we can&#8217;t help but feel that there aren&#8217;t enough hours during the day, as if the 24 hours that were allotted to us weren&#8217;t enough to cover all our priorities.</p>
<p>We can all honestly say though that the overwhelming feeling of having too many things to do is, at some point, our own doing.</p>
<p>When it comes to work, you have to ask yourselves if it&#8217;s all worth it. If your efforts bring a promise of triumph, then by all means, push yourself forward. Giving up is probably one of the biggest mistakes you can ever make when you strive to win. Every trial surpassed is a step closer to your goal.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#8217;ve made up your mind about going forward and overcoming all the hurdles, here are a few helpful tips that will make your mission easier:</p>
<p>1. Focus on what needs to be done - with the amount of work you still have to do, you need to know which elements are your priorities. Lower priority tasks can be rescheduled while you concentrate on the higher priority tasks.</p>
<p>2. Break down your schedule and allot a reasonable amount of time for each of the tasks - this applies more to the smaller tasks. While you cannot let go of and forget about the trivial matters, you only need to give a fraction of the overall time completing the less important chores.</p>
<p>3. Eliminate clutter - if you find yourself working in a chaotic environment, you will soon see that you also become less productive. Clutter distracts your mind, and if you need to clear the space before starting anything, then by all means, do so. In the end, you can concentrate better and finish your work faster.</p>
<p>4. Set goals - without goals, you simply drift through life like a fish that follows the current of the sea. Goals give you the adrenaline that you need to complete what needs to be done. Attaining your objectives will make you happy, and one way to get to this happy place is by working towards it.</p>
<p>5. Focus - make sure that you set up a corner in your house where there are fewer distractions. Don&#8217;t give in to temptation and position your work station beside the television. Be strong, be firm, even with yourself.</p>
<p>6. Know when to pamper yourself - spoil yourself and give yourself small rewards. The gratifying portion of your day does not have to be elaborate. In fact, a simple neck message or a cup of herbal tea will do.</p>
<p>7. Ask for help - know that even the heroes in movies needed help at some point. For us normal people, we would most likely need it even more. Seek the advice of friends and know that you can also delegate tasks to the people in your life.</p>
<p>If you continue to stress about everything, your health is bound to fail. It&#8217;s not a choice between your job and health. It&#8217;s simply a matter of balance, in knowing when to say no and let go. If the amount of work reaches the point wherein your health and relationships are affected, then maybe it&#8217;s high time to do sit down and consider rethinking what you&#8217;re doing.</p>

Goal Setting - Putting Motivation Into Perspective
If you&amp;#8217;ve ever worked in a corporate environment, especially in a management position, you&amp;#8217;re no stranger to the concept of establishing goals and their importance to any organization that practices management by objectives.

<p>Goal Setting - Putting Motivation Into Perspective</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve ever worked in a corporate environment, especially in a management position, you&#8217;re no stranger to the concept of establishing goals and their importance to any organization that practices management by objectives.</p>
<p>Even if you&#8217;ve never been in a position requiring you to define specific, measurable goals, you may not realize that every single day you&#8217;ve done so. Chances are, by not knowing you were actually setting goals, you were able to achieve them with far less analysis than accomplished through formal goal setting.</p>
<p>The difference between achieving formal goals versus informal goals is one of motivation. Quite often with formal goals, we may make progress towards our objective, but not have a clear understanding of the process required - and we often see a decline in our motivation to continue or to continue effectively.</p>
<p>This is perhaps most often seen in group work environments, where one or two members of the group seem to &#8220;Get It&#8221;, while others just sort of follow along, contributing as asked and simply waiting for others to ensure the goal is achieved at some hazy future point.</p>
<p>Yet as individuals, we are often able to accomplish our own informal goals almost subconsciously. Each and every day of our lives, we plan, act upon and accomplish innumerable short-term goals, while simultaneously working towards longer-term goals, by establishing patterns of activity.</p>
<p>For example, you may get up a 6:00 AM each weekday, shower, dress, have breakfast and drive to your place of employment. Odds are you&#8217;ve done these thousands of times without giving it a second thought and yet, you are in fact achieving five goals every morning.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re able to do this for several reasons - first of course, you understand the primary goal of getting to work on time each day at the task level. Next, your motivation for doing so no doubt includes the desire to avoid being fired for continued tardiness. Another motivation is simply a need to demonstrate being a reliable member of the organization.</p>
<p>On a longer-term basis, we often plan for and follow through on everything from vacations and holidays to paying off our mortgages and other debts. Here again, we have plenty of motivation to do these things and we do them subconsciously. And yet we often meet or exceed these goals with little or no effort.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s most interesting about this is that in our personal lives, we rarely use any elaborate system to track and complete these tasks. No software, no systems and at best might scribble down a reminder not to ourselves and stick it on the fridge.</p>
<p>If you really sit down and think about it, there&#8217;s no reason why you could not apply the same approach to your business or work related goals. A task is a task, whether it&#8217;s having to meet with a teacher at 2 pm or having to ensure a critical order was placed and is being tracked.</p>
<p>If you can find your motivation for staying on top of things at the office as you do at home, you&#8217;ll never again have any serious difficulty meeting your business goals!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to Become a Travel Writer</p>
<p>It would be nice to have the opportunity to travel extensively, wouldn&#8217;t it?  Some people do have that luxury and it can be a money maker.  If you like to write and also have time to travel, travel writing could be for you.</p>
<p><a title="Templom 120 méter mélyen a föld alatt" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/98091242@N00/3490989597/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none;" title="How to Become a Travel Writer" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3392/3490989597_210f651cb2_m.jpg" border="0" alt="Templom 120 méter mélyen a föld alatt" width="240" height="181" /></a><br />

<p>Travel writing begins with the trip.  Take note of what you pack, how you made your reservations, the method of travel, your hotel and what you did while you were there.  Each leg of the trip presents another aspect of travel that would be interesting to an audience.  Out of one trip, you can get enough information for ten articles.</p>
<p>If travel writing is an opportunity you would like to pursue, here are some tips to help you get started.  Another perk of travel writing is that it can be done as a home-based business.  Low overhead means more money to travel.</p>
<p>1.  Start a travel blog.  One way to gain interest and traffic is to become an expert in your field.  With a travel blog you can highlight certain aspects of travel.  It could be that you like to visit Caribbean destinations or stay in all kinds of hotels.  Since sites like Blogger.com let you create free blogs, you can devote a blog to each aspect of travel that you want to pursue.</p>
<p>2.  Sign up with websites that pay for travel articles.  There are many sites such as eHow, About.com and Associated Content that pay for well-written content.  If you can offer unique travel information you can get paid good money for your travel experience.</p>
<p>3.  Apply to be a travel writer with online travel magazines and other travel sites.  People visit the Internet every day to find out tips for traveling abroad, cheap but nice hotels and deals on transportation.</p>
<p>4.  Create a writer portfolio.  In it highlight your travel experience and what articles you have written about travel.  List your blogs for reference.  If you are familiar with an area that a travel company needs, you just might have a job.</p>
<p>5.  Search for freelance jobs with print travel magazines.  This is a harder market to get into but not impossible.  With the right query letter and confident approach you can get your foot in the door so you can be heard.</p>
<p>Travel writing is an exciting occupation for the right person.  Turn your travels into descriptive fantasies for your readers and gain an audience that could make you money.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Procrastination Avoidance Tips</p>
<p>Did you ever feel like you wanted to join the Procrastinator&#8217;s Club, but never quite got around to it? At some point in time, procrastination plagues us all, some more than others, but everyone at some point gets a bite from the bug.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all heard the quote, &#8220;Why put off till tomorrow what you can do today?&#8221; For some of us, this is the only motivation we need, while others struggle with putting things off for weeks, months, or even years.</p>
<p><a title="289/365 Good Day" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/26604660@N08/3493139601/" target="_blank"><img class="alignleft" style="border: 0pt none;" title="Procrastination Avoidance Tips" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3371/3493139601_e6a2f38e94_m.jpg" border="0" alt="289/365 Good Day" width="240" height="235" /></a><br />

With a little focus and the right attitude, coupled with some practical tips and techniques, procrastination can be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Here are five strategies you can use today to help you bite the procrastination bug back:</p>
<p>1. Set small goals. Many times, we feel overwhelmed with a task, so we continue to put it off until we have no choice but to complete it.</p>
<p>Now throw on all the new projects we received while we were putting off the first project, and you have a prime equation for some serious procrastination.</p>
<p>Setting small, quickly achievable goals can help you avoid procrastinating in the first place so you don&#8217;t get overwhelmed. Here are some tips for setting those small goals:</p>
<p>* Break your big project up into smaller steps. These steps can be completed systematically one at a time. Make sure you have well-defined end points for each smaller goal, that way you have something to keep you going.</p>
<p>* Setting small goals provides you a nonstop feeling of accomplishment as they&#8217;re attained. With each individual success, you feel better about yourself, and this motivates you to continue.</p>
<p>* Giving yourself break points allows you to focus on each individual task and takes the overwhelming feeling out of the job. In addition, they give you a prime place to get up, move around, and refresh yourself for the next step.</p>
<p>2. Avoid distractions. We all do it. We sit down to start working, but have to get back up and grab some coffee. Then we sit back down and check email, then voicemail, and then email again just to make sure no one sent a message while we were checking the voicemail. How long did that take?</p>
<p>* Try checking your email only twice a day instead of every 5 minutes. You need to have some time to focus!</p>
<p>* Get everything you want, need or think you need before you sit down to start working so you can concentrate.</p>
<p>3. Delegate. Start giving some of your responsibilities to others instead of hogging them for yourself and creating more stress. Stress leads to procrastination, procrastination leads to tight deadlines, and tight deadlines lead to more stress; it&#8217;s a vicious cycle.</p>
<p>4. Keep a list. A constant reminder of the things you absolutely need to do is a great way to avoid procrastination. A small pocket notebook or even a note card works wonders for list keeping.</p>
<p>* Keeping a list puts your daily to-dos in front of you at all times for quick reference.</p>
<p>* Include your small goals on your list. Get started early each day completing those small, easy goals. Doesn&#8217;t it feel great to scratch through the things you&#8217;ve completed? Before you know it, the whole list is marked off!</p>
<p>5. Turn it off. When you&#8217;re done for the day, shut down everything work related. Don&#8217;t take it home if you can help it. Turn your brain off at the end of your workday. By giving your brain a break, you help avoid over exhaustion and keep your mind fresh for the next day.</p>
<p>* Spend some time doing the things you love to recharge your batteries for the next day.</p>
<p>Pick one or two of these techniques and try them out for three weeks. Studies have shown it takes 21 days to form a habit and if you truly want to beat procrastination, you have to make productivity a habit.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;ve made a habit of one of the strategies, pick out another one, and before you know it, you&#8217;ll be the personification of productive!</p>
