      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.internetnetworkmarketingtraining.com/storage/networkmarketingsystemsecret.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1265426323100" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret's out...mlm lead generation &lt;em&gt;isn't&lt;/em&gt; as difficult as a lot of people make it out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure you've got to learn a few key important concepts...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then pick &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt; marketing method to learn...and then get &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; at generating leads with that method &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; adding in another method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's smart to have &lt;strong&gt;3-5&lt;/strong&gt; methods in place at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track your traffic...track your ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics let you see where your traffic is coming from. An ad tracker lets you test your ads if you're doing ad based marketing (solo ads, classifieds, etc)...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A paid tracking service is best if you don't want to bother putting one on your server (host it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="padding-left: 60px;"&gt;How to Get Targeted Leads&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, before you do any kind of mlm lead generation, you've got to have your website in place. This is the site where you ultimately want your leads to end up. In most cases it's going to be a &lt;strong&gt;lead capture page&lt;/strong&gt;. In some cases it's going to be a salesletter type page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This page is sometimes referred to as your "money page." This is the page where you want your prospects taking the &lt;em&gt;desired&lt;/em&gt; action...(opt in or buy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your page &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; perform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sending traffic to a page that doesn't perform well for you is a waste of your traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;know&lt;/span&gt; you're sending traffic to your lead capture page and you're &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; getting results...odds are the problem is &lt;em&gt;likely&lt;/em&gt; your lead capture page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure it's right. Your page should &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; to the types of prospects your sending to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you know a thing or two about &lt;strong&gt;copywriting&lt;/strong&gt;, then create your own site and write messages to put into your autoresponder system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know that a tiny percent of people will do all this...it's a lot I know. And if you do it wrong you've just wasted a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I recommend you tap into a good system like &lt;a href="http://www.mlmleadsystempromarketing.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mlm Lead System Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MLSP)and use it as &lt;em&gt;leverage&lt;/em&gt; indefinitely or until you create your own system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you need to know &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; kind of people you want to attract. That will depend upon what you're selling. (If you're using a system like MLSP, then it only attracts people who are interested in network marketing and network marketing buyers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you selling an opportunity? A system? A diet pill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;mlm lead generation&lt;/strong&gt; to work well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a)&lt;/strong&gt; You can decide to find people who are &lt;em&gt;actively&lt;/em&gt; searching for what it is you are selling and bring them to you. This require knowing about SEO and keyword research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;b)&lt;/strong&gt; Find out where your target audience likes to hang out and create a presence there. This could be social sites like Facebook (you've got to search for them) and Twitter or forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make a &lt;a href="http://homebizgal.xanga.com/720389817/mlm-marketing-strategy---the-difference-between-success-and-failure/" target="_blank"&gt;mlm marketing strategy&lt;/a&gt; and follow through. By tracking you'll know if what you're doing is working or not and you'll know what to &lt;strong&gt;tweak&lt;/strong&gt; and what to &lt;strong&gt;dump&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Inconsistent&lt;/span&gt; actions will breed &lt;strong&gt;inconsistent results&lt;/strong&gt; and can &lt;strong&gt;kill&lt;/strong&gt; your motivation and ultimately your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to have spectacular results, you'll want to &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt; the right way to do Internet marketing. This is why I always recommend Renegade University for &lt;a href="http://www.renegadeuniversitytrainer.com" target="_blank"&gt;mlm lead generation training&lt;/a&gt;. For what they charge it's a steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead generation &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;doesn't&lt;/span&gt; have to be &lt;strong&gt;hard&lt;/strong&gt; or&lt;strong&gt; frustrating&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you understood &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to generate leads, you'll experience how &lt;strong&gt;freeing&lt;/strong&gt; it can be to be really in charge of your business...and ultimately your destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/the-renegade-university/The_Renegade_University-MLM_Lead_Generation-_Unlocking_the_Secret.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>

      <guid isPermaLink="false">260733:3069171:6287584</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 120%;"&gt;Attraction marketing isn't as one dimensional as a lot of people make it out to be. There's more to it than meets the eye. In fact, you may have tried what you were told attraction marketing was...all to dismal results.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.internetnetworkmarketingtraining.com/storage/attraction_marketing_magnetpeople.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1263170255752" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people haven't been told the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone say's you can build your business using "attraction marketing" ask them to clarify what they mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odds are they have no idea as to what they're talking about. Or maybe they were told to throw around that phrase by their upline in hopes of getting people into their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have a notion that attractiion marketing is just sitting still and doing absolutely nothing and people will somehow &lt;em&gt;magically&lt;/em&gt; find them and buy their do-dad or join their opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attraction marketing is the new &lt;strong&gt;buzz&lt;/strong&gt; word... I'll give it that much. But a lot of people focus on the "attraction" part of the word, but not the "marketing" part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They go together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're building your business with leads and yes, some people still do that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've still got to build some form of &lt;strong&gt;trust&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;credibility&lt;/strong&gt; with them if you want them to take your recommendations and &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;buy&lt;/span&gt; from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's getting on the phone with them, doing follow up email, mailing a postcard, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see, &lt;em&gt;everybody&lt;/em&gt; is marketing to your leads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if you're building your business online, the people you're trying to lasso into your opportunity, your marketing system, whatever you're peddling are being courted by other people for &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; opportunity, marketing system, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what is attraction marketing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being credible, trustworthy, and displaying leadership skills. Your content has to come across as the same. It's also giving people what they want. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order to know what they want, you have to know their problems, their issues, what's on their minds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You and your content must be a solution to them. The "them" is the target audience you're trying to get into your business or buy your product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's the gist of it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You've got to work on &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt;. Jim Rohn once said that you have to spend more time working on &lt;strong&gt;yourself&lt;/strong&gt; than you do on your job. Substitute job for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you're thinking I'm just a beginner, how can I do this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's really simple. Always be working on yourself. Listen to Jim Rohn, Eli Drake, Dani Johnson, Doug Firebaugh, Tony Robbins... The list is endless. If you don't have your mind "straight" you won't do the things you need to do in your business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people fail at the &lt;strong&gt;starting line&lt;/strong&gt;. They quit before they even begin. They just talk themselves out of doing anything in their business. Then they look for something they think is easier. And then it becomes a cycle that they can't get out of. Start, quit, fail. Start, quit, fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second part is to learn about Internet marketing. I recommend &lt;a href="http://www.internetnetworkmarketingtraining.com/the-renegade-university/2009/4/13/renegade-university-what-is-renegade-university.html" target="_blank"&gt;Renegade University&lt;/a&gt; for learning the basics of &lt;em&gt;social media marketing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;social networking&lt;/em&gt;. And how to create content that is "attractable."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's like chipping away at a rock. If you chip at it once in awhile or whenever you get in the mood it's gonnna take you forever to make any kind of difference in that rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you do it everyday, before you know it you've made a difference in it. Your business is the same way. Chip at it everyday doing the &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt; things, and you will see a difference in your bottom line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;﻿&lt;strong&gt;Related Posts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It's not surprising that there are many people who want to learn the &lt;strong&gt;short-cut&lt;/strong&gt; to success... they don't want to read books, they don't want to study, and they definitely don't want to invest in themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They want the &lt;strong&gt;Cliff Notes&lt;/strong&gt; to success and they want it now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get people asking me how to make money. They want you to tell them the "secret" to getting it done fast, with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; effort at all. It's funny because I'm &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in the "make money" niche. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had this one guy on MySpace email me wanting to know &lt;em&gt;how to make money fast online&lt;/em&gt;. He told me he &lt;strong&gt;hated&lt;/strong&gt; to read and wanted to know if I could just tell him what it is he needed to do to make money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I chuckled and thought this guy has a lot of gall asking me this. Why would I invest my time and energy helping a person who is not interested in helping himself? And he doesn't like to read? C'mon! I politely told him that I was not the person who could help him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I should've turned him on to &lt;strong&gt;Jim Rohn&lt;/strong&gt;. I've listened to Jim Rohn since discovering him a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/fZru3_vygc0&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/fZru3_vygc0&amp;rel=0&amp;color1=0xb1b1b1&amp;color2=0xcfcfcf&amp;hl=en_US&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And by the way, the key to success is not going out trying to &lt;strong&gt;chase&lt;/strong&gt; down money (have you noticed that when you chase something it moves further away from you?)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has more to do about &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;. Attraction marketing is really about &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; attracting people to you. How you feel about &lt;em&gt;yourself &lt;/em&gt;will impact the way &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;you&lt;/span&gt; do business online. Do you see the pattern here?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Want to understand &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; to have a better business this year? Are you ready to learn about home based business success? Watch Jim Rohn as he lays down the important lessons he learned that made an impact on him as person and laid the foundation for his success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly Jim Rohn passed a way a few weeks ago...but his wisdom will continue to live on forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you're one of those people who can't seem to get your business going, then this is a trainer whose newsletter and products you should really subscribe to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite all the information, training, and other resources out there, there are just&amp;nbsp; a whole lot of people who just won't put forth the effort into their business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information overload. Not a secure reason &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they should even be in this business. Skepticism. You've tried and "nothing's" worked for you yet. There's a whole wagon full of reasons why you may be having a little bit of trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an article you should read by mlm trainer, Doug Firebaugh. It's gonna really make you think. It's going to make you want to do the things you've been putting off in your business...&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;especially&lt;/span&gt; if you ever thought about quitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;MLM Success- The Secret of Developing a Winning Mindset for Network Marketing Success&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;div class="info"&gt;Author: &lt;a href="author_1_873.html"&gt;Doug Firebaugh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="body"&gt;by Doug Firebaugh &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Failure. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The word almost makes me want to throw up. Because most people in MLM never realize that they have everything they need to succeed in Network Marketing. They just have been convinced by others that it is not there, or Success is some thing that is for others, but not them. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; People do not fail in Network Marketing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They quit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They embrace the lie that they really tried the business, but they will not succeed in Network marketing. They think they failed. If Success has not happened BY NOW, then it just is not going to happen. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Failure in MLM is the natural fruit of the mind as far as quitting goes. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Quitting is the fruit of a Losing mindset. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Most new mlm distributors lack the proper mindset to get through the tough times in MLM or any entrepreneurial enterprise, and they bring it into this business expecting to fail. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Most folks develop what I call a "Lottery" mindset and think that MLM is the lottery and they wait and see what numbers are drawn. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Dumb. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; It is called The Winners' Mind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; INFERNO Secret: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Winner's Mindset is a mindset of knowing that no matter what happens in your life and career, you will keep getting up off the ground and continue to move forward till the finish line is in front of you, and you cross it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A new distributor in MLM often plays what I call the "Try" game. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They are going to "Try" MLM and see what happens. That is a Losing mindset. They make their mind up that they will give this business a certain time frame, and if it doesn't produce what they want it to, then "it doesn't work". &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; They work their home business on THEIR terms, THEIR Time Frame, not the terms nor Time Frame that MLM requires. And they expect massive success. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; WRONG. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Network Marketing requires you to have a "No matter what" mindset, and No Matter What, you will continue to work and do what is required till success shows up. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You see, success in MLM requires many things: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Skillset. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Mindset. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Determination. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Discipline. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Attitude. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Communication. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Focus. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Belief. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Action. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; But... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Winner's Mindset requires: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; DETERMINED PATIENCE. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You MUST create a Patience about this because there is a learning curve to all new skills and careers, and this learning curve is innate to Network Marketing. So that is why you need to look at what your Mindset is going to be, as it will be tested during your early months of your business. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If you study Millionaires in MLM as I have, and including my former upline's Success and the Success I was blessed with, you will find that their mindset was like a run away freight train running down a mountain. They simply would not be denied, nor stopped, nor slowed down. They were focused on "All out Massive Action" and wanted to win like never before. Failure was not even an option. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; INFERNO Secret: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Millionaires in MLM did not take their business for granted. They saw it as their "way out" and went for it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; As a new distributor, or veteran, you must keep your mindset focused on what you need to do to create your home business success. And your mind will sometimes think thoughts that are doubtful, and negative. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; That is part of being human. We all go through that, and the Winners in life learn that they can control their thoughts and create the life they want from the inside Out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The Learning Reality must set in. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; When you start getting discouraged, and frustrated, as all entrepreneurs do, that's ok. It is part of the process of the Learning Curve, and we all went through it. And that is the time your mindset will need to be "I will not be denied" because that is what it will take to get through it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Call your upline and talk to them and see what they do when they get down. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Read a motivational book or listen to an inspiring tape, and see yourself succeeding in MLM. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; -Go out to lunch with a successful upline if possible and talk to them and tap into their belief system. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; INFERNO Secret: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You can do whatever you make your mind up to do in Network Marketing -- as long as it is powered by the heart. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A determined mindset is a fruit of a determined heart. Is your heart really into your business? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Do you have what we call the right "Heart Condition?" &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If your mindset is a result of the right "Heartset", then your success will be well on it's way. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; A Winner always has the mindset of one thing: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; CROSSING THE FINISH LINE! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; And it takes heart to do that. Never give up and never give in to your doubts as you WILL succeed. But most have more faith in their fear than their future. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; If you make up your mind and heart that you will Succeed, then it is guaranteed in MLM and Network Marketing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Blessings... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; doug Firebaugh / PassionFire Intl &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; � 2005 PFI / all rights reserved &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; http://www.passionfire.com &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; http://www.passionfire.com/pf_heat_7.html&lt;/div&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Renegade University is no doubt changing...it's changing a lot. It may a little confusing to people what all the different programs going on. I'll be breaking down each one as to what it is and what exactly can it do to help you as a marketer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renegade Breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://crisstar.RenegadeBreakthroughMentoring.com"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renegade Breakthrough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is for any marketer who wants to learn some intermediate/advanced Internet marketing strategies for lead generation.&lt;span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.internetnetworkmarketingtraining.com/storage/renegadeuniversitybreakthrough.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1255546884320" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a very hefty course and if you're still a Renegade University student that hasn't graduated to the professional level yet, then this course may be a little much for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's for the serious action takers who want to go to the next step in their business...and that next step is a mighty big one. Like I said it's not for everyone. I dare to say it's not for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are just a few of the topics Renegade Breakthrough covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Networking, Alliances, Partnering and JV's&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --You and Your Business Model: Viability &amp;amp; Long-Term Growth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --Outsourcing &amp;amp; Building an All-Star Marketing Team&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --Market Research: Finding and Creating a Hungry Mob&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --Creating Content: Building Your Own Fort Knox&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --&lt;span id="lw_1255544892_2" class="yshortcuts"&gt;Copywriting&lt;/span&gt;: Words That Sell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --The First Phase of Your &lt;span id="lw_1255544892_3" class="yshortcuts"&gt;Marketing System&lt;/span&gt;: Leading With Value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --The Second Phase of Your Marketing System: Closing The Sale&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --The Backend: Upsell Profits = Long Term Profits&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --Marketing To Your Lists: Getting Multiple Product Lines&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --Traffic Generation: Stuffing Your Marketing Funnel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; --Monetization: Turning Losses Into Sources of Profits &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and that's just a sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you ever imagined yourself being very confident of your marketing skills and creating endless leads with ease...and teaching other business owners to do the same then this step is a good step in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
