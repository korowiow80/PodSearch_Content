      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>As an example of the terrible toll the economic downturn has taken on the industry, Hi-Lo Trailer  closed its doors a few days ago.</p>
<p>Hi-Lo was famous for its unusual style of RV &#8212; a telescoping travel trailer. The top fit over the lower portion. While traveling, this made for a compact trailer with a low center of gravity. Not only was this safer to tow, but the hard sides made it possible to camp in the winter as well. </p>
<p>While camping, the top locked in the raised position with an automatic hydraulic system.</p>
<p>Hi-Lo Trailer Co. Inc. was in Belleville, Ohio. It was founded in 1955. The end of the company was announced in a July 6 letter to Hi-Lo dealers from company President Jim Beveridge.</p>
<p>Beveredige said shareholders ”have voted to liquidate the assets of the corporation and dissolve same, effective immediately.”</p>
<p>”In light of the current economic situation and the downturn in sales of recreational vehicles, Hi-Lo Trailer can no longer continue to operate,” the letter said.</p>
<p>The announcement came as a surprise to many. Late last year, the company announced that it had streamlined its 2010 product lineup to include four floorplans based on the Hi-Lo Classic. This implied that the company was surviving the recession.</p>

<p>The RVIA doesn&#8217;t track retail sales directly. It surveys the <a class="ld_link" href="/rv-manufacturers" target=" " title="RV manufacturers">RV manufacturers</a> and reports wholesale figures.</p>
<p>The most recent numbers are from May 2010  About 24,400 units were sold in that month. That&#8217;s the 10th month in a row of upwards trending.</p>
<p>For perspective, May&#8217;s shipments were 84 percent higher than the same month last year. On a seasonally adjusted basis, it&#8217;s an increase of 6 percent over April.</p>
<p>Motorhomes had the highest percentage gain in sales. This probably reflects the growing confidence in the economy. </p>
<p>Since towable represent the larger part of the market, they had a higher volume increase even though their percentage gain was lower. </p>
<p>In 2010 so far (through May), total RV shipments were 108,900 units. That&#8217;s a gain of 91.1 percent (!) compared to this same period last year.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><p>As the economy recovers, America is remembering the RV lifestyle.</p>
<p>During the downturn, <a class="ld_link" href="/rv-sales" target=" " title="RV sales">RV sales</a> suffered. Several major <a class="ld_link" href="/rv-manufacturers" target=" " title="RV manufacturers">RV manufacturers</a> went under. A couple of others spent time in bankruptcy, but are slowly recovering.</p>
<p>The important thing for RVers is that sales are rising again. It will take a while before it reaches the boom levels of a couple of years ago. Nevertheless, the industry is strengthening.</p>
<p>That means demand for RVs is picking up. And that means it&#8217;s not as easy to get a good deal as it used to be. </p>
<p>In late 2007 and 2008, dealers were desperate. But not any more. It&#8217;s getting tougher to get a good RV at a good price.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m remodeling this site. With a new design, hopefully it will be easier to find everything. It will also be updated more frequently.</p>
<p>Hope you find it useful!</p>
