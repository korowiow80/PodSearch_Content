<p>by Melisa Gerrow</p>
<p>When anyone is afflicted by any kind of an illness, condition or malaise, he or she very often prefers to find a remedy that uses all natural ingredients. Normally, this is because no one wants a cure that may end up having more symptoms than the original ailment. For instance, you wouldn&#8217;t want to use a remedy for hang nail that would cause you to come down with hepatitis. It is certainly normal to be fearful of anything you put into your body or any method you may use as a potential remedy for anything. This is true whether you are trying to lose weight, cure a cold or prevent reoccurring <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Because of this, many people seek a vitamin an herb that would be helpful in alleviating panic and anxiety from their lives. Many people have tried, sometimes with a certain amount of success, using herbs such as, Kava Kava and St. John&#8217;s Wort. However, though many people are not aware of this, herbs can have just as many side effects as prescription drugs. Therefore, you shouldn&#8217;t go out on an herb buying spree without having been directed to do so by a medical professional.</p>
<p>It is widely accepted that a good B vitamin complex can be helpful when confronting a condition that is</p>
<div id="attachment_1001" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B-VITIMINS.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1001" title="B VITIMINS" src="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/B-VITIMINS-300x224.jpg" alt="A Good B Vitamin" width="300" height="224" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Taking a B Complex Vitamin</p></div>
<p>brought on by nervous tension and anxiety. Many people have found help by including of good B complex vitamin in their daily routine. Of course, this is only helpful if the reason for your problem is that you are lacking a certain B vitamin. On the other hand, B vitamins are considered safe for anyone to take, while herbs are not always considered safe in all cases. The exception to this is niacin. Niacin is part of the complex and, when taken in excess it can cause a niacin flush. Therefore you should never exceed the recommended daily dosage for the B complex you are taking.</p>
<p>Recently, many people have found a, so-called, near vitamin named inositol to be very helpful when <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >dealing with panic</a> attacks. Inositol is found in many formulas which have been designed explicitly for the use of naturally calming nerves. Still, there are no guarantees inositol will cure your <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> syndrome. However, if you find a formula that includes it and there is nothing in the formula you have an aversion to, it might be worthwhile giving it a try. Most good formulas that can be helpful with panic attack include both inositol and taurine.</p>

In other words, if you were in a state of mind anxiety would not upset you or would not discomfort for you in any way, and furthermore you were not at all put off or taken back by <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>, anxiety and panic would never strike.</p>
<div id="attachment_986" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 293px"><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Taking-Time-to-Relax.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-986" title="Taking Time to Relax" src="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Taking-Time-to-Relax.jpg" alt="Taking Time For Yourself" width="283" height="424" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Take Time For Relaxing</p></div>
<p>Certainly anxiety disorder is a condition that no one tries to manifest. It would not be natural for someone to want to experience panic attacks or even slightly discomforting spells of anxiety. Still, it is when our apprehension of these things puts us on high alert that we lay the groundwork for anxiety to enter into our lives and <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> to overwhelm us.</p>
<p>Of course, no one can recommend actually enjoying anxiety and panic. However, it is when we have a mindset that makes us center our lives on trying to fight anxiety away and brace ourselves for panic attacks, we make our lives more prone to experiencing them.</p>
<p>The opposite of fighting anxiety and bracing ourselves for panic attacks is relaxation. When we take a relaxed attitude that panic and anxiety may just happen and we will be none the worse if they do, that we make ourselves less inviting to panic and anxiety. In other words, we are better able to be relaxed when we are not in constant fear of what will happen next. Also, we will not be in constant fear of panic and anxiety when we realize they will do us no more harm than they already have in the past.</p>
<p>Learning to physically relax helps us to take a more relaxed attitude. This is true whether we are trying to relax our attitudes toward anxiety so we can better cope with it, or if we were are trying to relax to simply help ourselves get more enjoyment out of life. The important thing to realize is that physical relaxation exercises help us to mentally relax our attitudes. Therefore, it is wise we make a daily practice of at least a half-hour of practicing physical relaxation.</p>
<p>Physical relaxation exercising can be as simple as laying down, closing your eyes, breathing a little  more deeply and slowly than normal and feeling the muscle groups in your body become less tense. The relaxation experience is further enhanced if, once we bring ourselves into a relaxed state, we concentrate on facing every day as a very relaxed person, being un-bothered by anything that happens throughout our day.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years it has been known that people who take brief respites were they can be relaxed are people who are better able to cope with anxiety and are less prone to having panic attacks.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> symptom is any symptom of any type of illness or physical calamity that is felt due to a state of anxiety instead of having a true underlying cause. Some of these &#8220;fake&#8221; symptoms can be mocked symptoms of a very disastrous physical occurrence, such as having a heart attack or thinking a stroke may be occurring.</p>
<p>Let me say this right off the bat; if you have any reason to suspect you may be having some serious affliction, such as a heart attack or a stroke, seek medical attention, immediately. Do not take a chance it may be a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> causing these symptoms. Before you conclude it is panic causing such symptoms, make sure your doctor tells you it is!</p>
<p>Having said that, it is very common for a person to think he or she is having some serious physical problem when it is panic attack fooling him/her into believing it is. Very often, panic will make a person feel as if he or she is short of breath or dizzy, when in fact it is an overabundance of adrenaline pumping through the bloodstream that is making him/her feel this way.</p>
<p>Panic can bring all sorts of symptoms. Sometimes people feel as if they have what is described as a feeling of un-realness. They claim they feel as if they are in another world and everything they see appears as if it is on an old film. They cannot connect with the world and, as one woman described it; &#8220;I feel totally out of it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Such feelings make people believe they are having some sort of a mental breakdown. Actually, panic is not mental; <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> are physical conditions. There brought on by an abundance of stress which multiplies into an anxiety disorder and this anxiety disorder keeps them in a state where adrenaline is flowing inordinately at all times. It is adrenaline that is responsible for these feelings of un-realness.</p>
<p>It is learning how to stop adrenaline from flowing over abundantly and at inappropriate times that is the key to <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >stopping panic</a> attack symptoms. There is no part of the brain that can fail and make a person have a panic attack. At times, it can be beneficial to receive psychiatric help because this can uncover what the underlying cause of the anxiety is.</p>
<p>However, many times self-help techniques can be very beneficial in <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcoming anxiety</a> and panic. Such self help techniques include learning what causes <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>, how to better deal with stress and how to stop adrenaline from building to the point it causes one to feel symptoms of panic attacks.</p>

<p>It has been said preparation is the key to success in any endeavor. When you think about it, you can see<a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Worried-about-test.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-948" src="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Worried-about-test-300x203.jpg" alt="Worried About Taking a Test" width="300" height="203" /></a> how true this is. It is like taking a test in school. If you study hard, there is a good chance you&#8217;ll pass the test. If you study very hard there&#8217;s a pretty good chance you&#8217;ll ace the test. However, if you don&#8217;t prepare for the test at all you will probably fail!</p>
<p>It is likewise true of anyone who is entering in to a business. He who does his homework and prepares to run the business before he actually starts doing this business will be much more likely to succeed than someone who simply tries to wing it.</p>
<p>So, you can see how preparation is a very key ingredient to having success in almost everything you do. However, preparation can actually be what is causing your anxiety attacks. While this seems like an outrageous statement, I have seen how preparation can actually bring on a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>. The more we prepare for something, the more respect we are giving it. Yes, we must respect the difficulty of that test we are going to have in school or we will probably fail. Likewise, we have to respect how difficult running a business can be. If we don&#8217;t we will truly get chewed up in the business world!</p>
<p>However, it is respect anxiety thrives upon. The more respect we give it, the harder its fires will burn. If we give it little respect we will not be tense and we will not giving it as much fear as we would be if we were giving it plenty of respect. Of course, if we are not tense and we are not in the state of fear, anxiety will not invade our lives.</p>
<p>Therefore, when considering how to prevent anxiety attacks, we should consider not preparing for them at all. By not preparing we are not giving anxiety any respect. Without giving any respect to anxiety attacks, or a potential oncoming anxiety attack, we will not be preparing for it and therefore we will not be tensing our bodies and we will not be working ourselves into a state of fear about the possibility of anxiety coming on.</p>
<p>Without fear and tenseness present in are being, we will be starving anxiety of the fuel it needs to get started. So, how do you prevent anxiety attacks? In short, a good way to start is by refusing to ever prepare for one.</p>

<div id="attachment_941" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Panic-Alone.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-941" src="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Panic-Alone-300x199.jpg" alt="Alone with a Panic Attack" width="300" height="199" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Panic Sufferers do not have to be Alone</p></div>
<p>One of the first problems a person suffering from <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> has to deal with is the fact he or she feels as if no one else understands what <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> are all about. Because of this, people who have frequent or occasional panic attacks feel a sense of loneliness. They feel as if they are the only ones who have ever experienced the horrible sensations panic brings with it. They tend not to discuss this problem with anyone else because they feel they would be laughed at or at the very least, ignored.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attack</a> syndrome makes a person feel misunderstood because they think those who have never experienced will be unsympathetic. They often feel as those who don&#8217;t experience panic will be arrogant towards those who do experience.</p>
<p>Fortunately, people who are unsympathetic to <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> sufferers are few and far between. First of all, even those who do not suffer anxiety know someone who does. Perhaps they have close friends or family members who suffer panic attack syndrome and therefore they have been exposed to it. These people have seen what it&#8217;s done to their friends and family members in therefore realize it is a very substantive issue. Besides this fact, hopefully the days are gone when people laugh at others who are suffering.</p>
<p>Beyond these facts is the fact many, many people suffer from panic attacks or have in the past. Obviously, these people totally understand what a panic attack sufferer is going through when he or she has these spells of panic. Also, people who have recovered from panic attack syndrome are usually very willing to help those who are now going through it. They realize it is not a weakness and certainly nothing to laugh at anybody for having.</p>
<p>Another way panic attack sufferers can be helped in their plight to cope with panic attacks is by realizing it is a condition that is widespread. There is a tendency to think whenever one is experiencing panic that no one else in the whole world is experiencing panic at that time. The truth of the matter is; if you&#8217;re in a crowded room and you are suffering panic, you will find there is probably someone else suffering panic at the same time.</p>
<p>Though it is certainly not a cure for panic, some comfort can be taken by knowing there are other people who understand totally and absolutely what you were going through when you are suffering a panic attack. In short, knowing there are others that are going through the same thing you are and realizing panic attack syndrome has been a widespread affliction for centuries can be a very helpful first step in coping with panic attacks.<!-- odiogo-notts-begin --></p>

<div id="attachment_931" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Anxious.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-931" src="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Anxious-225x300.jpg" alt="Anxiety Attack Coming On" width="225" height="300" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anxiety Strikes</p></div>
<p>If you do your research, you will soon find out that the most common denominator of anxiety attacks is stress. It is a fact that stress is something that we cannot live without. At some level, stress is actually good, especially when it stays at a level that provides enough pressure on us to perform at our best. However, if it is going to go beyond that point, then it will cause something that is undesirable. At some point, stress can become a cause for a lot of diseases. With that, it is one of the many <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/panic-attacks/" >causes of panic attacks</a> and anxiety.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to prevent panic and anxiety attacks, you have to hatch a plan to control your level of stress by getting <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/anxiety-panic-attacks/" >anxiety and panic attacks</a> help. We all know that we may not be able to get rid of it totally; but, containing it at a certain level should prevent it from going overboard and cause the attacks.</p>
<p>To get rid of stress, one way of achieving it is to avoid the things that trigger it. For example, people get stressed out when they are getting too much pressure from their jobs. Juggling family and work obligations can also become too stressful for some. If your job gets you too stressed out, then the best way to keep the level of stress at bay is to give yourself a break by going on a vacation. For sure your employer would agree to it, since it is for your welfare.</p>
<p>To balance your family and work tasks, do not try to do everything by yourself. You can always ask your spouse to take some of the obligations as well. Try to set up a schedule in picking up or dropping off your kids at school. Take your turn in doing the laundry or the dishes. Share everything, so that you will be able to get some burden off your shoulders.</p>
<p>These are just simple tips you can follow as an <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/anxiety-panic-attacks/" >anxiety and panic attacks</a> help. However, when you follow these simple tips it would really take you a long way.</p>

<p>Anxiety panic disorder can be difficult to deal with because of the unique nature of this affliction. Because of the unusual qualities of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>, it is often necessary to contact a medical professional to see about a medication that will help overcome bouts of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>.</p>
<p>It is thought that many people have <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> at different times in their lives and that these panic attacks come in spells. It is also believed that if you get through this stage of your life when panic seems to be occurring often, the spells of panic will just kind of leave on their own. Therefore, taking medication on a temporary basis would be justified because when the spells of panic no longer afflict you, it will no longer be necessary to take the medication.</p>
<p><strong>Doctors Can Be Helpful Even Without Prescribing Medication</strong></p>
<p>However, many people choose not to go the medication route. Having said that, I need to suggest you discuss this possible medication-less trek toward a cure with your doctor. Usually, your doctor will agree that trying to <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome panic</a> attacks without medication is a worthwhile endeavor. Still, there are many self help tactics your doctor could suggest to help you through these bouts.</p>
<p>Beyond using self help for <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcoming anxiety</a> panic disorder it is helpful to realize that reoccurring panic attacks are a common affliction. Literally millions of people now have, or have had bouts of panic at different periods in their lives.</p>
<p><strong>Panic Disorder is Not Uncommon</strong></p>
<p>I understand one of the disconcerting things about panic attacks are that when you have one you feel alone and you feel as if no one else could possibly understand what you&#8217;re going through. Quite the opposite is true. If there are several people around you when you are experiencing panic, you will surely find someone else who understands exactly what you are going through. I have found knowing this to be very helpful.</p>
<p>I have also found meditation classes to be very helpful. This meditation can be found with yoga. Without telling you how to lead your life or to suggest you practice some lifestyle that does not conform with your religion, I have to tell you yoga has been very helpful to me.</p>
<p>When practicing yoga your mind becomes very quiet. As this happens, it makes stress impossible to develop. Stress, we all know lies underneath panic. When we eliminate stress, we cut the legs out from beneath panic. Therefore, it stands to reason practicing yoga, and other types of medication or even simple relaxation exercises can be very helpful getting you through the stage in life where panic seems to be an affront to your everyday happiness.</p>

It is also felt when a person perceives an external threat. However, chronic and irrational anxiety can lead to a form of anxiety disorder. There are different types of anxiety disorder depending on their causes or triggers.</p>
<p>Common forms of anxiety disorders</p>
<p><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong></p>
<p>A person who has this type of anxiety disorder usually experience prolonged anxiety that is often without basis. More accurately, people with generalized anxiety disorders cannot articulate the reason behind their anxiety. This type of anxiety usually last for six months and often affect women.  Due to the persistence of the anxiety, people affected with generalized anxiety disorder constantly fret and worry. This results to heart palpitations, insomnia, headaches, and dizzy spells.</p>
<p><strong>Specific phobia</strong></p>
<p>Unlike someone with generalized anxiety disorder, a person who has a specific phobia experiences  extreme and often irrational fear of a certain situation or object. When exposed to the object or situation they fear, people with specific phobias exhibit signs of intense fear like shaking, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and nausea. Common specific phobias include fear of heights, enclosed spaces, blood, and animals. The fear a person with phobia feels can be so extreme that he or she may disregard safety just to escape the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Panic disorder</strong></p>
<p>Also known as <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/agoraphobia/overcoming-agoraphobia/" >Agoraphobia</a>, panic disorders are characterized by recurring <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> which are often unexpected. Symptoms are usually shaking, chest pains, dizziness, fear of losing control, and reluctance of being alone. People with panic disorder are aware that their panic is usually unfounded  and illogical. This is why they avoid public situations and being alone. A <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> can be so severe that people may lose control and hurt themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Social phobia</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively called social anxiety, a person with social phobia may exhibit similar symptoms like those of panic disorder especially in social situations. Shaking, dizziness, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations may ensue when a person with social phobia finds his or herself at the center of attention or in the company of many people, regardless whether they are strangers or not.</p>
<p><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong></p>
<p>People with obsessive-compulsive disorder experience anxiety caused by a persistent obsession or idea. They tend to avoid experiencing anxiety by resorting to repetitive actions or behaviors that prevent anxiety. For example, a person who is obsessed about cleanliness may experience anxiety at the mere sight of a vase placed slightly off-center. To prevent anxiety, he or she will clean and organize everything compulsively or without reason.</p>
<p><strong>PTSD</strong></p>
<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder may occur after a person experienced a severely traumatic event. He or she may relive the experience in his or her mind which causes stress and anxiety. If a person with PTSD comes into contact with stimuli (any object, person, or situation) that he or she associates with the traumatic event, he or she may literally re-experience the event by crying uncontrollably, panicking, or losing control. Subtler symptoms include insomnia and avoidant behavior. PTSD may manifest itself immediately after the traumatic event or even years after.</p>
<p>Determining the type of anxiety disorder a person has is crucial to seeking treatment and recovery.  Techniques and methods that are used to help a person cope with a certain anxiety usually target not only the management of symptoms but coping mechanisms when exposed to triggers. Only after thorough diagnosis can treatment and recovery for anxiety disorders really commence.</p>

Ricky Gervais and the BBC&#8217;s stunningly successful sit-com &#8220;The Office&#8221; has been a huge hit around the world spawning countless spin off&#8217;s and remakes.</p>
<p>The fact is that the comic situation transfers across cultural barriers. The exact idioms of the language may alter but essentially we see people in the show that we relate to in our own workplace &#8211; sometimes we even see ourselves.</p>
<p>The people are not the only aspect of the show tat transfers, so do the situations the characters find themselves in. Do these two quotes from The Office strike a chord?</p>
<p>Jim Halpert: Because right now, this is a job. If I advance any higher, this would be my career. And if this were my career, I&#8217;d have to throw myself in front of a train.</p>
<p>Michael Scott: This is our receptionist, Pam. If you think she&#8217;s cute now, you should have seen her a couple years ago.</p>
<p>These lines may be funny yet they point to something basic and fundamental pertaining to the work place: stress and more specifically work related stress.</p>
<p>The UK Health and Safety at Work Executive (HSE); the UK government&#8217;s Work related health and safety body define work related stress as: “the adverse reaction a person has to excessive pressure or other types of demand placed upon them.&#8221;</p>
<p>A certain degree of stress is healthy, t keeps us on our toes and drives us to achieve. In essence stress will cause us to lead more fulfilling lives. The difficulty is here however, is how do we create a healthy balance of stress because too much stress and anxiety is certainly harmful to your health and well-being? What techniques can we apply to encourage stress and anxiety relief in our lives? Stay with me for a short while and we&#8217;ll look at 10 simple ideas to initiate stress and anxiety relief at work.</p>
<p>Tune Into Your Body</p>
<p>A simple idea it may be, but one that is the key to unlocking the box to the other stress and anxiety relief techniques that we shall examine. Be aware of the degree of stress that you&#8217;re experiencing at any one moment in time. First of all you need to know when your stress levels are rising.</p>
<p>Measure your stress level on a scale of 1-10. While you&#8217;re at home find a time when you are alone and when you can lie down with your eyes closed. Put on your favourite music for relaxing or just sit in silence, whatever works best for you. Just let your mind wander and do not seek to hold your thoughts, no matter how fleeting. After 10 minutes or so you should be aware of level zero stress.</p>
<p>this is the gauge for measuring all other stress levels. During the day check into the scale and not the level of tension that you&#8217;re feeling: are your shoulders hunched and tense; how does your gut feel, is it tight and churning; is your jaw clenched?</p>
<p>Take time to move</p>
<p>Movement is a great way to reduce stress levels. Just by getting out of your seat and moving around you will find that you will feel a measure of stress and anxiety relief. A brisk walk during your lunch break and a short jogging session at the end of the day will reduce tension. Generally aim to keep fit anyway.</p>
<p>Take time for deep breathing</p>
<p>Simply breaths deeply, inhaling through the nostrils, after holding the breath for a count of three exhale slowly through the mouth.</p>
<p>Take time to use your minds power of imagery</p>
<p>This is another great way to bring stress and anxiety relief into the workplace. Just take a moment or two to imagine that yo are somewhere else. Hear the sound of the sea, create the vivid colours of the sky in your mind, soar of to your favourite place and do not wait for that distant vacation; go there today. The more vivid the images the better this stress and anxiety relief technique will work.</p>
<p>Take time to challenge your irrational thoughts</p>
<p>Be aware of you inner voice and the messages that it is sending to you. Often these thoughts are based on previous mind conditioning and the thoughts will be harmful and create unnecessary levels of stress. For example if you are under pressure to get something done by a particular time you may find yourself thinking&#8221; I must get this done or else I&#8217;m fired and I&#8217;ll need to find another job!&#8221; This is probably not the case and if it is then you&#8217;re probably better looking for another job anyway.</p>
<p>Take time to plan work into smaller manageable tasks</p>
<p>A large taks can be overwhelming and may need to be broken down into simpler easier to complete jobs. We meet more step by step targets this way and feel agreater sense of achievment after each step is finished. Give yourselfa reward for completing the smaller taks and do not wait for the final task before you give yourself a pat on the back.</p>
<p>Take time to reduce cafine intake</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a two-year old completely wired after chomping through a few cookies or drinking cola? Well that’s exactly what happens to all of us when we take in too much sugar or caffeine. However, unlike the nipper at home we can’t very well run around the office making airplane noises, we just carry the excess stress.</p>
<p>Take time to have a play break</p>
<p>Some professionals keep “squish” balls, or stress balls, in their work space a simple squeeze is all that is needed for rapid relief of stress and anxiety. Other people take a few minutes to play a game at www.addictinggames.com. They’re quick (less than five minutes), easy to play, and many don’t require a download.</p>
<p>Take time to Blow Off Steam &#8211; but fairly</p>
<p>don&#8217;t think that you can&#8217;t vent a little, but just remember words spoken in anger can haunt you for a long time if they’re read or overheard by the wrong person. Don’t put anything in email you don’t want the whole office to see.</p>
<p>take time to understand that a little stress is worthwhile</p>
<p>Finally, remember that it’s natural to feel stress when you leave your comfort zone. Some stress must be endured as you expand your horizons, learn new tasks and earn new responsibilities. That kind of stress may not be much fun, but in the long run, it’s worth it!</p>

<p>Anxiety attacks, <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> and anxiety disorder all set traps for its victims. The reason for this is anxiety and even simple nervousness, is brought on by the flight or fight syndrome and they bring with them feelings that are disturbing enough to cause people to try to escape from them. Escaping from anything means fighting with it or running away from it. In other words, fight <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/RelaxationCauses.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-898" title="Relaxation Causes" src="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/RelaxationCauses-200x300.jpg" alt="Causes Relaxation" width="200" height="300" /></a>or flight. As you can see, this is counterproductive because anxiety intensifies as we try to fight it or run away from it.</p>
<p>Everyone experiences nervousness to some degree and most people experience anxiety of some type. However, if we try to flee from the feelings this anxiety brings to us we only help its fires to burn hotter. By the same token, the more we wrestle with it in an attempt to make it subside the more we also intensify the feelings anxiety brings on. Therefore, recognizing nervousness and anxiety and then trying to avoid them is a prescription for more anxiety and more nervousness.</p>
<p>Many people find help by simply doing their best to ignore any symptom brought on by anxiety or nervousness and concentrating on the feelings which are brought on by relaxation. For this reason, it is very helpful to use simple relaxation techniques periodically. Then when you get yourself to the point where you are engulfed in relaxation, you will have experienced relaxation and can recall the feelings this relaxation has brought to you anytime you wish.</p>
<p>By doing this you no longer are fighting with anxiety. Thus, you will not be causing it to intensify. Instead, you will be using the positive reinforcement of relaxation to stop the cycle that intensifies nervousness.</p>
<p>To bring yourself into a state of relaxation you can simply use any of the common relaxation techniques that are available. Some of these techniques actually use self hypnosis. However, many people find that lying down and listening to soothing music will help do the trick. Also, progressive relaxation is the preferred choice of many.</p>
<p>With progressive relaxation one simply lies down, closes his eyes and instructs each body part to relax. Normally this is done starting with the feet and going right up to the facial and scalp muscles. It is important when carrying out this technique that you feel your muscles loosening up in every part of your body.</p>
<p>With any relaxation technique it is helpful to start by taking two or three deep breaths. This is done by breathing slowly in through the nose and even more slowly out through the mouth. Deep breathing is always helpful for anyone chasing relaxation.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, the normal person faces many obstacles to relaxation during the day. However, by practicing relaxation on the off-hours or prior to sleep at night, an anxiety suffer can experience true relaxation and will then have something to build on during anxious moments throughout the day.</p>

<p>n the truest technical term agoraphobia is the fear of the marketplace. Though this is the most technical definition of the term it is still true that many people who are suffering from this affliction experience their greatest bouts of fear when they are shopping.</p>
<p>Other times, people suffering from agoraphobia fear wide-open spaces or simply being outside. Others experience problems when they are driving, or driving under certain conditions. For instance, many people experience their greatest fear when they&#8217;re driving over bridges. The progression people suffering from this ailment experience, is they generally fear one place in particular and subsequently stay away from visiting this place.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the problem doesn&#8217;t stop there as they will eventually become afraid to venture into different areas and they will likewise prevent going to these places. When a person becomes afraid of more and more places he or she will eventually choose to stay home because so many places have become too difficult for them to venture out into.</p>
<p>The underlying cause to all of this is the fact these people experience <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>. In short, most people develop agoraphobia because repeated <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> have led them to become fearful of more and more places and eventually the only place they feel comfortable is in their own homes.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcoming agoraphobia</a> requires <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcoming panic</a> attacks. Though many people try to overcome the agoraphobia first it will only be temporary if they do succeed and don&#8217;t bother to deal with the panic attacks. The reason this is true is because the panic attacks will cause these people to become afraid of different places or even places they have recently their fear of visiting.</p>
<p>As this happens they will become more and more apprehensive to visit more and more places and therefore they will develop agoraphobia once again. It is considered common knowledge that people can <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome agoraphobia</a> by being helped out of their homes and little by little, day by day, led further away from their domicile. Then, as time goes on, these people will once again become comfortable with the outside world.</p>
<p>The problem is this technique does not help them <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome panic</a> attacks and usually it is the panic attacks that have caused the fear of leaving home in the first place. Therefore, trying to cure agoraphobia before curing panic attacks is putting the cart in front of the horse.</p>

It is as if nothing has happened but suddenly<a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Teenage-Girl-in-Elevator.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-887" title="Teenage Girl in elevator" src="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Teenage-Girl-in-Elevator-300x199.jpg" alt="Teenage Girl in Elevator" width="300" height="199" /></a> our life has changed because now instead of living normally we are overwhelmed by anxiety and panic. When this happens it is the center point of our existence because we have all we can do to simply live through this period of time as we hope and try to gather all strength together to try to get through it.</p>
<p>When panic strikes, it is often in response to some little event or even a mere thought that triggers its onset. These little events or mere thoughts are what we refer to as <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> triggers. Often it is a physical sensation, such as a quick pain, especially if it is to the head or chest region that provides the trigger.</p>
<p>Of course, pains to head and the chest should be checked out by a medical professional. What we&#8217;re talking about here is a situation where you have already found out what you are experiencing is panic and not a different medical issue such as migraines or heart problems.</p>
<p>Other than true physical feelings, another thing that often times provides a panic attract trigger is a very unpleasant thought like &#8220;what if this elevator door doesn&#8217;t open?&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attack</a> triggers simply start the panic ball rolling. These triggers are what start the adrenaline shooting through every part of our body. Adrenaline, in turn, brings on more feelings and thoughts that provide triggers to more panic. As this occurs, an even heavier dosage of panic gets added into the bloodstream!</p>
<p>One school of thought is; if we can avoid panic attack triggers we can avoid <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>. This way of thinking, while it seems reasonable, actually presents a bigger problem. This is due to the fact that if we try to avoid situations which bring on certain thoughts, like the one about the elevator door not opening, we will actually be creating more problems for ourselves. In other words, we will be bringing about more obstacles to a happy existence.</p>
<p>In order to prevent panic attacks we should actually learn to live through the triggers that tended to provided us with panic attacks in the past. In other words, certain places or situations that bring on panic should not be avoided. Also, though it may seem somewhat ironic, we should actually think about things that usually bring on panic attacks and make these thoughts so commonplace that they no longer carry with them the fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>While this is a very simplified version of a lesson in avoiding panic attacks, it has the basic elements that need understand in order to be successful in fending off panic and <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcoming anxiety</a> altogether. These basic elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn not to shy away from panic attack triggers</li>
<li>Be as relaxed as you can without trying to force relaxation</li>
<li>Know that millions of people have gone through the same thing you&#8217;re going through now</li>
<li>Understand that while you are in the recovery phase, panic attacks will come from time to time but they will be less and less severe if you don&#8217;t try to fight them off or run from them</li>
<li>Make sure to live your life as normal as possible and go through the motions the best you can even if you feel you are unable to give it your all.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is true you may not be able to do everything you can when you&#8217;re feeling well. For instance, by all means, don&#8217;t drive a car if you feel you&#8217;re unable to and don&#8217;t push yourself too hard. Just accept the fact you will get better if you let your panic attack disorder run its course.</p>

<p>than another while another type of anxiety may require a different course of action. In this article, we will discuss several common anxiety attack treatments and basically summarize how each works.</p>
<p>The following are some treatments commonly prescribed to help <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome anxiety</a> attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cognitive behavior therapy</li>
<li>Exposure therapy</li>
<li>Medication</li>
<li>Education and acceptance</li>
</ul>
<p>With cognitive behavior therapy you are taught how to focus your thoughts and get right down to the bottom of them. You are led to the root cause of why you are thinking the way you are. Then you can see how some of the things that have been causing your problems are actually irrational. In other words, cognitive behavior therapy teaches you how to find out where your thought patterns have gone astray. Then, once you have exposed the folly of the beliefs that brought you to the point of anxiety disorder, you can free yourself of the disorder.</p>
<p>Exposure therapy helps you to confront whatever it is you are afraid of in a safe environment. Exposure therapy is often used for people suffering from <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/agoraphobia/overcoming-agoraphobia/" >agoraphobia</a>. When people are suffering from <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/agoraphobia/overcoming-agoraphobia/" >agoraphobia</a> they are afraid to leave their home. With exposure therapy they are brought away from home with one trained professional and possibly several of their friends. Little by little they are led further into the world and eventually without the support of the complete entourage helping them to leave their houses. Of course, this is a bit of an oversimplification but it is basically what exposure therapy is all about.</p>
<p>There are several different types of medications a medical professional can prescribe to someone suffering from anxiety disorder. Of course, the medication and the amount of the medication is determined by several factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The type of anxiety disorder</li>
<li>Whether or not <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> accompany the anxiety disorder</li>
<li>How long the sufferer has had the condition</li>
<li>The severity of the condition and/or the frequency of the <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Many times the medication is prescribed temporarily. However, sometimes the medication may be administered for many years.</p>
<p>Education and acceptance simply teaches the sufferer what is behind the anxiety or panic attacks biologically. In other words, when the sufferer realizes that the panic attacks are more of a chemical reaction then a true mental condition, the anxiety level will often drop immediately. Also, it is true that often anxiety disorders can be like other common ailments and simply need to run their course.</p>
<p>When the sufferer learns not to intervene and simply live with the condition while it burns itself out, it will often leave without any particular steps being taken.</p>
<p>No matter which anxiety attack treatment you choose, make sure you see your doctor first and check all your options and by all means, make sure he or she tells you it truly is anxiety you are dealing with and not anything else.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="gpp_data"><a class="gpp_link" href="https://plus.google.com/112788519324230096635?rel=author">Edward Lathrop</a> <br /><span class="gpp_bio">Webmaster and Administrator of, as well as contributor to <a href="http://stopanxietystoppanic.com">Stop Anxiety Stop Panic</a>.</span></div><p>Panic and anxiety attacks really are not in any way uncommon today. Panic generally seems to emerge from nowhere then control the panic and anxiety attack sufferer’s life. When sessions of panic are occurring they are the only thing that matters for that sufferer. It seems to become progressively worse for several minute. Eventually, at some time the panic goes away, at least for a while.</p>
<div id="flickrImage_1" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/twicepix/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4140225979_83ec8071f9_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="160" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">relaxing muscles tends to repell panic  relax © by twicepix</p></div>
<p>The most important thing to know about panic or any sort of anxiety attack is that it may be the struggle you put up which makes it powerful. Having a chance to be flexible will lessen the harshness of panic and will actually put an end to it altogether.</p>
<p>The simple reason behind this is the undeniable fact that tightening up your system encourages adrenaline flow inside the bloodstream. It really is adrenaline flow that produces you nervous to begin with in fact it is increased adrenaline flow which brings nervousness in to the arena of anxiety and in addition brings anxiety into the realm of panic.</p>
<p>Once you tense up you are doing the very thing that panic endures. If, conversely, you&#8217;re to take it easy every one of the muscle groups within your body, panic would not develop. For this reason it is important to consider the attitude you won&#8217;t fight against the panic and anxiety attack when it appears to be approaching.</p>
<p>Sometimes instead of bracing themselves against panic, panic sufferers will endeavour to mentally try to escape from it instead. Simply attempting to pretend panic just isn&#8217;t coming your way is really a type of running away. Realizing panic is approaching and analyzing it&#8217;s a extremely effective method of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >stopping panic</a> before it gets started. It sounds ironic however, if an oncoming <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> brings fear of any kind to your life it features a tendency to develop. However, once you address it and accept panic, it will dwindle away.</p>
<p>One other way we could think of this analysis is much like this: When a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> is classified as being approaching, the panic sufferer tightens up so as to brace him/herself for the brutal session going to happen. If this shrinking and bracing could possibly be eliminated, the panic could possibly be as well. This is true because without securing, nervous symptoms can&#8217;t be overwhelming like they could be to a tightened up, fully braced person.</p>
<p>Realistically, it is very important to realize fighting off panic is what actually can make it think about it. It is difficult initially to get used to not wanting to combat something that feels like it&#8217;s harming you. However once you develop the knack for doing that you will find the panic becomes much less until you&#8217;re actually controlling it instead of allowing it to control you.</p>

<p>one&#8217;s life varies greatly. For instance, everyone experiences some nervous anxiety. There are many times in everyone&#8217;s life were it would be abnormal not to be anxious. It is when the nervous anxiety occurs without provocation that it can be considered a disorder.</p>
<p>However, just because one can become anxious at inappropriate times does not mean he or she will be necessarily inconvenienced by this disorder. It is when a person can no longer live life without being influenced by his or her condition that the disorder needs to be reconciled.</p>
<p>One aspect of nervous anxiety that can alter one&#8217;s life drastically is <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> syndrome. <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attacks</a> are an unwanted offspring of anxiety. <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attacks</a> are a problem because they occur at inopportune times and after they are experienced a few times the sufferer of these panic attacks tends to stay away from certain places or activities in an attempt to avoid having them. This behavior can lead to a condition known as <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/agoraphobia/overcoming-agoraphobia/" >agoraphobia</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/agoraphobia/overcoming-agoraphobia/" >Agoraphobia</a> is a condition where people are afraid to leave their homes. It should be duly noted that a child of nervous anxiety, such as panic attacks and agoraphobia, can occur over time if abnormal anxiety is not dealt with in its early stages.</p>
<p>The bottom line is nervousness and nervous anxiety is a normal part of life. If this type of nervousness is not dealt with properly, panic attacks can develop. A good start in <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >dealing with anxiety</a> is simply realizing that it will happen from time to time and when it does it can cause physical sensations that are unpleasant and even scary. It is when the sufferer of the spells of anxiety tries to fight these feelings that they will intensify. Therefore, one key to nipping such a condition in the bud is to let normal spells of anxiety run its course without trying to push them away.</p>
<p>Even wishing anxiety will not happen to you is a form of fighting anxiety. Doing this will result in more anxiety because simply wishing it did not exist is a form of tensing up. Of course, nervousness is more likely to live in a tense body then a relaxed one. Therefore dealing with nervous anxiety requires one is willing to accept all forms of anxiety for what they are; namely they are jolts of adrenaline sparked in a body that is not relaxed.</p>

<p>built to the point that the amount of adrenaline it has caused to run throughout the body has become maxed out. Is very common for a nervous person to suffer panic attacks and what is even more confounding is it is common for a person who is not seen as a nervous person to also suffer panic attacks.</p>
<p>Panic attacks stem from a condition known as anxiety disorder. Though this is a very daunting term it is important to understand that it is usually not a permanent condition. There are ways to <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome anxiety</a> disorder and thus do away with the panic attacks that accompany this disorder. Anyone who suffers panic attacks is said to have an anxiety disorder however, not everyone who suffers an anxiety disorder will have panic attacks.</p>
<p>Either way, the road to recovery involves seeing a doctor about the symptoms the anxiety is causing. The reason this is important is a doctor can tell you whether any these symptoms lead to any physical ailments or they are all just a part of your anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>For instance, many people who suffer anxiety whether panic is accompanying the anxiety or not, will complain of tightness in the chest. Whenever anyone suffers tightness in the chest he or she should see a doctor very quickly so the doctor can tell him whether there is some problem with the heart or it the tightness is a symptom of some anxiety he or she has been suffering.</p>
<p>Once the anxiety sufferer has a clean bill of physical health, he or she can go about the business of overcoming the anxiety disorder or any of the other nervous symptoms that he or she may be experiencing.</p>
<p>There are many things that can help a person <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome anxiety</a> disorder. Some of these are natural methods and most people prefer to try such methods first before they are put on a subscription that helps and anxiety sufferer live with anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>One such natural method that has helped many people <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome panic</a> attacks and anxiety disorder in general is simply learning <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/anxiety-3/"  >what causes anxiety</a> and what is going on in the body when anxiety is occurring. It is also very helpful to many people when they understand just how common anxiety disorders are in that they are not alone when they are experiencing anxiety. Support groups are very helpful for this.</p>
<p>Still, the most important thing that leads to recovery of panic attacks and anxiety is knowing that physical disturbances that are felt during bouts of anxiety are just a manifestation of adrenaline and not true physical ailments, such as heart disease or hypertension. It is very important to note that only a doctor can tell you this for sure.</p>

<p>Mine is like this. Shaking body, extreme heat, sweating, short breaths, fast heart beat and mild nausea. My ears are filled with sound of windy forest, leaves rubbing each others. I feel like I&#8217;m going to die, hopeless and alone. Waves of emotions of fear, anxiety, anger and sadness.</p>
<p>I hate it when I have it middle of night, while I&#8217;m asleep.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[It all started a few months ago when the girlfriend i lost my virginity too tried breaking up with me, after a two and a half year relationship. And ever since the day she threatened to break up with me, i developed separation anxiety disorder. In summary, its a disorder in which is similar to obsession but not necessarily, for example if she doesn't sleep on the phone with me, i have a panic attack, i cant sleep, i shake, sometimes i even puke from the feeling, resulting in me calling her repeatedly or even driving to her house. There are even times where i would dread on her going to work the next morning cause then i literally wait hours and hours just for her to get off, as to a normal human would go about there business, and then meet up, as to i actually wait every second of every hour. I would feel normal until she doesn't answer the phone, then i cant eat, sleep, watch tv, i just walk around in a pace having an anxiety attack. <p class="read-more"><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/anxiety-disorder-with-girlfriend/">Read more &#187;</a></p><p>Here is a post from the blog <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com">Stop Anxiety Stop Panic</a>.

I would feel normal until she doesn&#8217;t answer the phone, then i cant eat, sleep, watch tv, i just walk around in a pace having an anxiety attack. its a feeling of nervousness and panic, it is not something i want to feel, although it is something i cannot avoid. It occurs mostly at night as it is 3 in the morning here. It feels as if i always want to be next to this person and if not i cant do anything, i would compare this feeling to lets say losing your kid in a crowded area, you could imagine the breakdown and panic you would have, very similar. I love her very much, but i don&#8217;t know why i feel as if i need to always be there with her and if not it results in a massive panic anxiety attack..  i was wondering, any idea as to why i have this disorder, and what are the ways to cure it? If anyone can help id appreciate it..thanks

<p>Best reply by Stu147:</p>
<p>You are having an extreme and irrational reaction to your basic fears of abandonment and that has triggered anxiety.  Your diagnosis of your problem is as good as anyone else&#8217;s could be.  The question is not what and why, but how you go about addressing this.  And realising WHY you need to address this.</p>
<p>There are two reasons that you need to address this.  One is that it is making you unwell, it is dominating your life and detracting from it.  The other reason is that it is placing a very heavy and unfair burden on your girlfriend.  She no longer has free choice because she must be overwhelmed by the intensity of your reactions to the tiniest bit of separation from her.  This can only serve to crush the life out of the relationship.  In a sense, your fears will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Your anxiety will suffocate any chance of the relationship surviving, and you may well end up putting so much pressure on your girlfriend that she too begins to crack.</p>
<p>What you need to do, and this is not optional, is seek counselling.  Begin with your doctor, and ask to be referred to a psychologist.  You need guidance to get your emotional responses under control, and you may well benefit from some medication to help take the edge off the symptoms.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever had a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> knows how life stopping these events can feel. A <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> can seriously hurt your quality of life by causing you become terrified of a repeat episode. This terror is just another negative side effect of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>, and you should learn to think of it as such so that you can get on with your life without the constant fear of a panic attack hanging over your head. Worrying about having a panic attack all the time might even cause you to trigger <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> later. </p>
<p>Panic attacks feel a lot like heart attacks. A panic attack might cause your heart to race, and it might cause you to become short of breath. You might find that you feel dizzy or light headed, and they are characterized with the feeling of life or death importance. It is not uncommon to believe that you are dying or about to die when you are having a panic attack. Fortunately for sufferers, they are usually not of a long duration, and will stop when they have run their course, usually a few minutes, or when the cause of the panic is removed.</p>
<p><strong>Click HERE To end your panic attacks today!</strong></p>
<p>If you are terrified that you might have another panic attack, you may just end up cutting yourself off from everything in order to avoid having another. You might hide from the world, or otherwise separate yourself from the friends and family who might otherwise be able to help you. If this sounds familiar to you, then you need to consider seeking professional help to empower you to dispel the threat of panic attacks that hangs over your head. </p>
<p>You may also be able to help yourself by avoiding the situations that cause you to have your panic attacks in the first place. One of the biggest <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/panic-attacks/" >causes of panic attacks</a> is stress, and if you are constantly in stressful situation, then you will be at a much higher risk for panic attacks in the future. This stress is not necessarily the stress that comes over a few days over a particular event; panic attacks are triggered by constant stress over a period of months or sometimes even longer. This stress is often too much for people to bear, and even if we do not realize that, our bodies do, and they rebel. </p>
<p>Panic attacks can also be caused by certain situations. If you get a panic attack every time you are running late, or stuck in traffic, or going over a bridge, then you need to make sure to avoid those situations to prevent these same events from triggering more panic attacks in the future. You can take a different route to work, leave early, and avoid roads that you know will be snarled with traffic or even head to a local place for dinner after work before facing the drive home. </p>
<p>If you practice avoiding panic attacks and chart where you were, what you were doing, and how you felt immediately prior to each panic attack, then you can use this information to avoid the things that trigger you. You may be able to save yourself a lot of trouble with your mental and even your physical health later down the road. </p>
<p>Panic attacks do not just feel remarkably like heart attacks; recent studies have linked experiencing panic attacks with an increased likelihood of actually having a heart attack later. Keep your odds low and keep your stress levels down to avoid panic attacks and to remain as healthy as possible. No one likes to suffer, and panic attacks certainly fall into the category of suffering. </p>
<p>If you are at risk for panic attacks or you have had them in the past, then you should examine the past causes of your panic attacks so that you can help yourself to avoid similar situations in the future. You should also get in contact with your doctor to find out if you may need medication or therapy to help you take charge of your life and get away from the panic attacks. It can be difficult to determine exactly the best means of preventing panic attacks, but you may get better results when pairing the practice of avoiding triggers with medication to help you feel calmer. A therapist can also help you learn mental tricks to help you ride through the panic attacks without completely losing your cool the next time you feel one coming on.</p>

<p><strong>Definition of Anxiety</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety is defined as a state of apprehension or fear resulting from the anticipation of a real or imagined threat, event, or situation. It is one of the most common human emotions experienced by people at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>However, most people who have never experienced a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>, or extreme anxiety, fail to realize the terrifying nature of the experience. Extreme dizziness, blurred vision, tingling and feelings of breathlessness—and that’s just the tip of the iceberg!</p>
<p>When these sensations occur and people do not understand why, they feel they have contracted an illness, or a serious mental condition. The threat of losing complete control seems very real and naturally very terrifying.</p>
<p>Fight/Flight Response: One of the root <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/panic-attacks/" >causes of panic attacks</a>?</p>
<p>I am sure most of you have heard of the fight/flight response as an explanation for one of the root <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/panic-attacks/" >causes of panic attacks</a>. Have you made the connection between this response and the unusual sensations you experience during and after a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> episode?</p>
<p>Anxiety is a response to a danger or threat. It is so named because all of its effects are aimed toward either fighting or fleeing from the danger. Thus, the sole purpose of anxiety is to protect the individual from harm. This may seem ironic given that you no doubt feel your anxiety is actually causing you great harm…perhaps the most significant of all the causes of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>.</p>
<p>However, the anxiety that the fight/flight response created was vital in the daily survival of our ancient ancestors—when faced with some danger, an automatic response would take over that propelled them to take immediate action such as attack or run. Even in today’s hectic world, this is still a necessary mechanism. It comes in useful when you must respond to a real threat within a split second.</p>
<p>Anxiety is a built-in mechanism to protect us from danger. Interestingly, it is a mechanism that protects but does not harm—an important point that will be elaborated upon later.</p>
<p>What Are The Causes Of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic Attacks</a>? The Physical Manifestations of a Panic Attack: Other pieces of the puzzle to understand the causes of panic attacks.</p>
<p>More Info: <strong>Click Here</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nervousness and Chemical Effects…</strong></p>
<p>When confronted with danger, the brain sends signals to a section of the nervous system. It is this system that is responsible for gearing the body up for action and also calms the body down and restores equilibrium. To carry out these two vital functions, the autonomic nervous system has two subsections, the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system.</p>
<p>Although I don’t want to become too &#8220;scientific,&#8221; having a basic understanding of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system will help you understand the causes of panic attacks.</p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system is the one we tend to know all too much about because it primes our body for action, readies us for the “fight or flight” response, while the parasympathetic nervous system is the one we love dearly as it serves as our restoring system, which returns the body to its normal state.</p>
<p>When either of these systems is activated, they stimulate the whole body, which has an “all or nothing” effect. This explains why when a panic attack occurs, the individual often feels a number of different sensations throughout the body.</p>
<p>The sympathetic system is responsible for releasing the adrenaline from the adrenal glands on the kidneys. These are small glands located just above the kidneys. Less known, however, is that the adrenal glands also release adrenaline, which functions as the body’s chemical messengers to keep the activity going. When a panic attack begins, it does not switch off as easily as it is turned on. There is always a period of what would seem increased or continued anxiety, as these messengers travel throughout the body. Think of them as one of the physiological causes of panic attacks, if you will.</p>
<p>After a period of time, the parasympathetic nervous system gets called into action. Its role is to return the body to normal functioning once the perceived danger is gone. The parasympathetic system is the system we all know and love, because it returns us to a calm relaxed state.</p>
<p>When we engage in a coping strategy that we have learned, for example, a relaxation technique, we are in fact willing the parasympathetic nervous system into action. A good thing to remember is that this system will be brought into action at some stage whether we will it or not. The body cannot continue in an ever-increasing spiral of anxiety. It reaches a point where it simply must kick in, relaxing the body. This is one of the many built-in protection systems our bodies have for survival.</p>
<p>You can do your best with worrying thoughts, keeping the sympathetic nervous system going, but eventually it stops. In time, it becomes a little smarter than us, and realizes that there really is no danger. Our bodies are incredibly intelligent—modern science is always discovering amazing patterns of intelligence that run throughout the cells of our body. Our body seems to have infinite ways of dealing with the most complicated array of functions we take for granted. Rest assured that your body’s primary goal is to keep you alive and well.</p>
<p><strong>Not so convinced?</strong></p>
<p>Try holding your breath for as long as you can. No matter how strong your mental will is, it can never override the will of the body. This is good news—no matter how hard you try to convince yourself that you are gong to die from a panic attack, you won’t. Your body will override that fear and search for a state of balance. There has never been a reported incident of someone dying from a panic attack.</p>
<p>Remember this next time you have a panic attack; he causes of panic attacks cannot do you any physical harm. Your mind may make the sensations continue longer than the body intended, but eventually everything will return to a state of balance. In fact, balance (homeostasis) is what our body continually strives for.</p>
<p>The interference for your body is nothing more than the sensations of doing rigorous exercise. Our body is not alarmed by these symptoms. Why should it be? It knows its own capability. It’s our thinking minds that panic, which overreact and scream in sheer terror! We tend to fear the worst and exaggerate our own sensations. A quickened heart beat becomes a heart attack. An overactive mind seems like a close shave with schizophrenia. Is it our fault? Not really—we are simply diagnosing from poor information.</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Panic Attacks: Cardiovascular Effects</strong></p>
<p>Activity in the sympathetic nervous system increases our heartbeat rate, speeds up the blood flow throughout the body, ensures all areas are well supplied with oxygen and that waste products are removed. This happens in order to prime the body for action.</p>
<p>A fascinating feature of the “fight or flight” mechanism is that blood (which is channelled from areas where it is currently not needed by a tightening of the blood vessels) is brought to areas where it is urgently needed.</p>
<p>For example, should there be a physical attack, blood drains from the skin, fingers, and toes so that less blood is lost, and is moved to “active areas” such as the thighs and biceps to help the body prepare for action.</p>
<p>This is why many feel numbness and tingling during a panic attack-often misinterpreted as some serious health risk-such as the precursor to a heart attack. Interestingly, most people who suffer from anxiety often feel they have heart problems. If you are really worried that such is the case with your situation, visit your doctor and have it checked out. At least then you can put your mind at rest.</p>
<p><strong>Causes of Panic Attacks:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Respiratory Effects</strong></p>
<p>One of the scariest effects of a panic attack is the fear of suffocating or smothering. It is very common during a panic attack to feel tightness in the chest and throat. I’m sure everyone can relate to some fear of losing control of your breathing. From personal experience, anxiety grows from the fear that your breathing itself would cease and you would be unable to recover. Can a panic attack stop our breathing? No.</p>
<p>A panic attack is associated with an increase in the speed and depth of breathing. This has obvious importance for the defense of the body since the tissues need to get more oxygen to prepare for action. The feelings produced by this increase in breathing, however, can include breathlessness, hyperventilation, sensations of choking or smothering, and even pains or tightness in the chest. The real problem is that these sensations are alien to us, and they feel unnatural.</p>
<p>Having experienced extreme panic attacks myself, I remember that on many occasions, I would have this feeling that I couldn’t trust my body to do the breathing for me, so I would have to manually take over and tell myself when to breathe in and when to breathe out. Of course, this didn’t suit my body’s requirement of oxygen and so the sensations would intensify—along with the anxiety. It was only when I employed the technique I will describe for you later, did I let the body continue doing what it does best—running the whole show.</p>
<p>Importantly, a side-effect of increased breathing, (especially if no actual activity occurs) is that the blood supply to the head is actually decreased. While such a decrease is only a small amount and is not at all dangerous, it produces a variety of unpleasant but harmless symptoms that include dizziness, blurred vision, confusion, sense of unreality, and hot flushes.</p>
<p><strong>Other Physical Effects of Panic Attacks:</strong></p>
<p>Now that we’ve discussed some of the primary physiological causes of panic attacks, there are a number of other effects that are produced by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, none of which are in any way harmful.</p>
<p>For example, the pupils widen to let in more light, which may result in blurred vision, or “seeing” stars, etc. There is a decrease in salivation, resulting in dry mouth. There is decreased activity in the digestive system, which often produces nausea, a heavy feeling in the stomach, and even constipation. Finally, many of the muscle groups tense up in preparation for “fight or flight” and this results in subjective feelings of tension, sometimes extending to actual aches and pains, as well as trembling and shaking.</p>
<p>Overall, the fight/flight response results in a general activation of the whole bodily metabolism. Thus, one often feels hot and flushed and, because this process takes a lot of energy, the person generally feels tired and drained.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Causes of Panic Attacks<br />Mental Manifestations: Causes of Panic Attacks</strong></p>
<p>Are the causes of panic attacks all in my head? is a question many people wonder to themselves.</p>
<p>The goal of the fight/flight response is making the individual aware of the potential danger that may be present. Therefore, when activated, the mental priority is placed upon searching the surroundings for potential threats. In this state one is highly-strung, so to speak. It is very difficult to concentrate on any one activity, as the mind has been trained to seek all potential threats and not to give up until the threat has been identified. As soon as the panic hits, many people look for the quick and easiest exit from their current surroundings, such as by simply leaving the bank queue and walking outside. Sometimes the anxiety can heighten, if we perceive that leaving will cause some sort of social embarrassment.</p>
<p>If you have a panic attack while at the workplace but feel you must press on with whatever task it is you are doing, it is quite understandable that you would find it very hard to concentrate. It is quite common to become agitated and generally restless in such a situation. Many individuals I have worked with who have suffered from panic attacks over the years indicated that artificial light—such as that which comes from computer monitors and televisions screens—can can be one of the causes of panic attacks by triggering them or worsen a panic attack, particularly if the person is feeling tired or run down.</p>
<p>This is worth bearing in mind if you work for long periods of time on a computer. Regular break reminders should be set up on your computer to remind you to get up from the desk and get some fresh air when possible.</p>
<p>In other situations, when during a panic attack an outside threat cannot normally be found, the mind turns inwards and begins to contemplate the possible illness the body or mind could be suffering from. This ranges from thinking it might have been something you ate at lunch, to the possibility of an oncoming cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>The burning question is: Why is the fight/flight response activated during a panic attack even when there is apparently nothing to be frightened of?</p>
<p>Upon closer examination of the causes of panic attacks, it would appear that what we are afraid of are the sensations themselves—we are afraid of the body losing control. These unexpected physical symptoms create the fear or panic that something is terribly wrong. Why do you experience the physical symptoms of the fight/flight response if you are not frightened to begin with? There are many ways these symptoms can manifest themselves, not just through fear.</p>
<p>For example, it may be that you have become generally stressed for some reason in your life, and this stress results in an increase in the production of adrenaline and other chemicals, which from time to time, would produce symptoms….and which you perceive as the causes of panic attacks.</p>
<p>This increased adrenaline can be maintained chemically in the body, even after the stress has long gone. Another possibility is diet, which directly affects our level of stress. Excess caffeine, alcohol, or sugar is known for causing stress in the body, and is believed to be one of the contributing factors of the causes of panic attacks (Chapter 5 gives a full discussion on diet and its importance).</p>
<p>Unresolved emotions are often pointed to as possible trigger of panic attacks, but it is important to point out that eliminating panic attacks from your life does not necessarily mean analyzing your psyche and digging into your subconscious. The “One Move” technique will teach you to deal with the present moment and defuse the attack along with removing the underlying anxiety that sparks the initial anxiety.</p>
<p>Before moving to the key of this, let’s examine some of the common myths and misinterpretations of an anxiety disorder.</p>

When trying to figure out why some  of us have to suffer through <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>, or in my case, used to  suffer through panic attacks, I guess we need to discuss a little human  biology. However, we could make this human biology course a pretty short  one by simply saying adrenaline is behind panic. Adrenaline is a  chemical that helps drive we mammals.</p>
<p>From time to time mammals will work themselves into a condition where  adrenaline changes their behavior and feelings. We&#8217;ve all seen a scared  dog or especially a scared cat and we&#8217;ve noticed the way they&#8217;re hair  stands up and their backs hunch. When a cat is in this condition he is  not so because he choses to be. He does not realize his hair is standing  up and he does not realize his back is arched. It is the adrenaline  causing this.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is secreted when we are in a state of fear. We were  created to have extra power when we were in this state. This is because  we certainly need extra resources when we are under attack or need to  overcome some foe. For instance, if we had met up with a wild tiger we  would need to get out of his area in a real hurry. While this is very  unlikely to happen, adrenaline would give us the ability to run faster  in such a situation. We would react without thinking and because of the  adrenaline have a better chance of survival than we would have if we had  no adrenaline in our system.</p>
<p>When adrenaline comes over us for what seems like no reason, we then  have the chance to take inventory of our feelings. Unlike when we meet  up with a tiger and have no time to ponder how we feel, in normal  everyday living situations we will not be running away from wild animals  and we will have plenty of time to realize the feelings adrenaline has  brought on.</p>
<p>When we are in a state of adrenaline, our pupils dilate, our heart  races, our palms sweat, our muscles tighten up and we certainly feel  very strange. So strange in fact, that is possible to sometimes even see  things that didn&#8217;t really happen. This is because of a combination of  imagination and our strange, unfocused, filmy vision we all seem to have  when adrenaline is pumping heavily through our bodies.</p>
<p>Being in a state of adrenaline is very scary so, many of us try to  fight away the scary feelings. The problem is, adrenaline is brought on  by the flight or flight syndrome. So, if we try to fight the strange  feelings adrenaline has brought upon us, we will simply pump more  adrenaline through our bodies and the strange sensations we are afraid  of will become even stronger.</p>
<p>The condition where a person is pumping adrenaline through his body,  then fears its feelings thus pumping more adrenaline through his body,  is called the &#8220;<a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >cycle of fear</a>&#8221; and the arts of overcoming a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>  lies in the ability to unwind the <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >cycle of fear</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to realize that what made the adrenaline come on the  first place is is not relevant. Adrenaline can start pumping for any of  many reasons and it is natural. It is when we think that the heavy  pounding in our chests is a heart attack and the vision tricks that we  are watching life through is a brain malfunction that panic overwhelms  us. Of course, if are converned about your physical health, you should  check with a medical professional about these concerns you have.  However, the bottom line is when we fight the sensations of adrenaline  and fear, we can work ourselves into a state of panic.</p>
<p>This is not to say we&#8217;ve done anything wrong or that we should blame  ourselves if we have a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>. However, it is important to note  the next time we start to feel as if a panic attack is coming, it is  best we not try to fight it off. Letting adrenaline flow through our  bloodstreams will not do us any harm. However, trying to fight or run  away from the adrenaline will bring on more adrenaline and possibly  leave us vulnerable to panic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attacks</a> are there to be combated and overcome. If you are suffering from such medical and mental conditions, it would be helpful and appropriate if you would lean the correct and effective means of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >dealing with panic</a> attack. You have to learn several techniques and instill in yourself several realizations so that you could finally overcome and emerge from the disorder.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >Dealing with panic</a> attack requires understanding what <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> actually is. To begin with, a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> should be defined. The case is an onset of abrupt episode of fear that is so intense, your heart beat is racing, you have shortness of breath and you are experiencing paranoia. A panic attack usually happens for no reason at all. You can just become fearful without actually fearing anything. If you are frightening yourself during <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>, also remember that people around you might also be in states of panic. That is why you should further be careful and controllable.</p>
<p>While in the past, panic attacks were classified as stress or nervousness situations, these days, the disorder is considered a medical condition. In that way, there is a need for medical and expert intermission and assistance. Panic attacks affect overall quality of life because they come unexpectedly, at times causing major embarrassment.</p>
<p>Handling panic attack</p>
<p>Dealing with panic attack is very easy, contrary to common beliefs and perceptions. First of all, realization and understanding of panic attacks is really needed. Once you further understand the condition, you would realize that you would feel less fearful when an onset of an attack comes in. when that happens, you become less afraid and paranoia can be effectively curtailed, if not totally prevented.</p>
<p>Taking the right and prescribed medications and therapies is also one effective way in dealing with panic attack. You could abruptly <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >stop panic</a> attack by taking in prescribed medicines, usually depressants, like serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, benzodiazpines and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Such depressants help lower the rapid heart beat that is greatly contributing to further onset and possible setbacks of panic attacks.</p>
<p>Relaxation and self assurance</p>
<p>Overall relaxation is essential especially if there is faintness, shortness of breath and muscle tensions caused by the major and usual onsets of panic attack. Dealing with panic attack requires acquisition and development of relaxation techniques and strategies within yourself. While this may sound easy, take note that however easy you look at it, during onsets of panic attack, it may seem hard to relax. This is when your will power would be tested. If you strive and successfully emerges to relax, you are dealing with panic attack effectively and more appropriately.</p>
<p>Panic attacks may last a few minutes to as long as several hours. To ensure yourself, it would help if you would seek medical and expert help. Doing so is not just ensuring safety but is also psychologically giving assurance that everything will be alright. Often, panic attack patients mistake their attacks for something else, probably a heart attack. This suspicion might further affect and worsen the condition. If an expert or doctor would give assurance that the condition is only panic attack, the patient may be more assured that everything is controllable. This equates to a better strategy dealing with panic attack.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you are seeking prevention of panic attack, there is no way the onset of the condition can be avoided. However, dealing with panic attack better and more effectively would help combat the condition and avoid any possible setbacks and disastrous possible effects. Regularly consult your doctor or appropriate experts for treatment and therapies. Dealing with panic attack can surely be easy if you know how.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attack</a> can be an extremely frightening experience. Suddenly, your hit by a barrage of symptoms, you may feel like having a heart attack, suffocating, or losing control. This experience can be so traumatizing and real that you will feel like dieing right at that moment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attack</a> can strike anytime, anywhere and to anyone. It don&#8217;t even need a reason to hit you. Although excessive stress can trigger a panic attack, it is completely random for most of the time.</p>
<p>However, once you experienced the first panic attack, the body will be put on &#8220;alert&#8221; status and the chances of having another attack is increased. This becomes a problem if panic attack occur again and again.</p>
<p>An important contributor to the occurrence of further <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> is related to where the first one occurred. For most, it happens in a place where they cannot escape easily: for example, in a train, bus, taxi, elevator, building. For example, if the panic attack occurred during a bus ride, chance are, you would be quite nervous during your next bus ride as you think panic attack might hit you again. The more nervous you are, the more likely another panic attack will happen.</p>
<p>With your initial experience with panic attack, you will most probably try to escape before you feel the attack coming on. Once out of the bus, the panic feeling subside and your worst fear is confirmed. You associate bus ride to your panic attack. A few more experiences confirms this and you avoid taking a bus altogether.</p>
<p>What I have just explained is a typical example of the development of panic attack and it can be applied to any situation. You have a panic attack at a particular place or situation. You link it to that place or situation and avoid it.</p>
<p>The main culprit here is fear. The fear and anxiety of having a panic attack causes it to happen. Panic attack feeds on fear and anxiety. The more your fearful of it happening, the harder and faster it will hit you. In order to control a panic attack and stop it forever, you need to attack its roots &#8211; fear.</p>
<p>The most effective way to <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >stop panic</a> attack forever is to KNOW that you will not be harmed. A large part of the fear comes from the fact that the sufferer thinks he is about to die, which is totally untrue!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few FACTS about panic attack:</p>
<p>-Panic attack CANNOT cause heart attack</p>
<p>-Panic attack CANNOT cause suffocation</p>
<p>-Panic attack CANNOT make you faint</p>
<p>-Panic attack CANNOT cause you to go mad/crazy</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t feel like it? But its true! There more than enough medical evidence to prove all these. The symptoms feel unnatural because its a panic response from the body, your not suppose to feel it unless your in danger &#8211; which your not! Panic attack is the result of this &#8220;panic alarm&#8221; going off for the wrong reason. Use this knowledge to your advantage, KNOW that you are safe and panic attack cannot harm you. Don&#8217;t fear panic attack&#8230;and certainly don&#8217;t fear having one!</p>

<p>You’re short of breath. You’re heart won’t stop racing, you’re unbelievably tense, and you feel like you can’t breathe. What is wrong with you? Why do you feel this way? What is a “Panic Attack”? A <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> occurs when the body gets overloaded with stress. It cannot handle the anxiety it is being put under, and so then it manifests itself into what is termed a “Panic Attack”.</p>
<p>Learning to cope with the <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>, can be very difficult in the beginning. You must learn to keep your fears from getting worse and out of control if nothing else. Realize that you are in complete control of the given situation. There are some steps you can take to prepare right now, before you have your next attack. These steps can make dealing with the next occurrence significantly easier.</p>
<p>Try to think about the most relaxing and peaceful place you have ever been. Try to remember with every sense of your body the way it made you feel. Capture that feeling in your minds eye and tell yourself to allow your body to feel that way right now. Keep up these visuals while inhaling and exhaling deep breaths. Soon you will begin to feel the stress and anxiety leave you as it is replaced by a relaxed and calm feeling.</p>

<p>If you suffer from <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/stop_anxiety/anxiety-panic-attacks/" >anxiety and panic attacks</a> and visit a doctor or psychiatrist &#8211; you are almost always going to be given a prescription for medication. This is simply because doctors don&#8217;t have much time and believe it to be the fastest solution to your anxiety problem.</p>
<p> Most doctors have the best intentions but simply do not spend all their time in finding alternatives for these chemicals that may cause many unpleasant side effects.</p>
<p> Here you will find some very good reasons to treat your anxiety without medication – and the best natural alternative for doing exactly that.</p>
<p>Why should you try to get rid of anxiety without medication?</p>
<p>First of all, you must know that medication will not cure anxiety disorders! It can only keep them under control while, and if, you receive psychotherapy!</p>
<p>Second, anxiety medication can cause different problems – from mild to severe ones. The most common side effect is drowsiness. You really don&#8217;t need that while you are working, driving, or doing anything else. High-potency benzodiazepines have few side effects other than drowsiness. You can very easily get used to them and may need higher and higher doses to get the same effect. In short, they are very addictive.</p>
<p>Other possible side effects include:</p>
<p>Headaches, nausea<br />
dizziness<br />
unsteadiness<br />
problems with coordination<br />
difficulty thinking or remembering<br />
increased saliva<br />
muscle or joint pain<br />
frequent urination<br />
blurred vision<br />
changes in sex drive or ability </p>
<p>Another reason to cope with anxiety without medication:  The minute you stop taking them, anxiety will return full blown. Do you need any more reasons for managing your anxiety without medication?</p>
<p>#1 Alternative for treating anxiety without medication &#8211; Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is very useful in treating anxiety disorders. The cognitive part helps you change the thinking patterns that support your fears, and the behavioral part helps you change the way you react to anxiety-provoking situations.</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapy teaches you to understand and change your thinking patterns so you can react differently to the situations that cause you anxiety. Makes sense, right? And this is exactly how you should eliminate your anxiety without medication – and forever.</p>
<p> How does it work?</p>
<p>You are probably well aware that a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> is a &#8216;fight or flight&#8217; response to a perceived threat. <strong>In short, a separate part of your brain becomes more active during a panic attack. </strong></p>
<p>The problem, as you well know, is that once the <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> begins and that heightened state of fear starts, it is very difficult to calm yourself down. In order to calm yourself you need the brains mental activity to change. Deep breathing, for instance, will not help you. All deep breathing does is try and restore calm to the body.<strong> Trying to mentally calm the body is like shutting the gate after the horse has bolted.</strong></p>
<p>Just coping with this condition is not good enough. Cognitive Therapy will teach you how to free yourself from ever having another panic attack.</p>

<p><strong>1. Thinking You Have No Control Of Your Feelings</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an easy enough assumption to make as the <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> seem to come from out of nowhere but the real problem is not that first flash of panic but the fact that you are terrified of the feelings. If you can take that fear out and not be scared of HOWEVER you are feeling they simply do not happen, ever again. To solve this problem you need to learn EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques). This simple technique will take your fear on any topic down to zero, very fast. It is a method which utilises tapping on the meridian points while saying out loud a statement of how you are feeling. You take a reading before and after so you can quickly verify your results which gives you confidence to continue.</p>
<p><strong>2. Confusing The Feelings Of Physical Exertion With Panic</strong></p>
<p>This is a big one and what stops most <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> sufferers from getting excited or involved with anything. The symptoms of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> are caused by an increase of adrenaline so any feelings that are similar instantly make you think you are about to have an attack. At one point I couldn&#8217;t bear to watch game shows as the anticipation was just too much for me. Once you add even more adrenaline to the mix and increase your heartbeat by even a millisecond you start to freak out again. The solution to this one is quite simple. Recognise this is what is happening and say to yourself, it&#8217;s ok, I&#8217;m just feeling the symptoms of physical exertion/excitement, I am not panicking. And it&#8217;s a good opening statement to get down to zero using EFT. You can use something like &#8211; Even though the feelings of physical exertion make me feel like I&#8217;m going to panic&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>3. Ignoring Advice To Take A Deep Breath</strong></p>
<p>Your chest is clenched tight, you can&#8217;t breath, and some well meaning person is saying, take a deep breath now. And all you can think is, are you mad, why would I want my head spinning even more? The thing is that hyperventilation causes the exact same symptoms as panic. When you can&#8217;t breath you are breathing from your chest, in essence overbreathing, and a few deep breaths from your abdomen will stop this almost instantly. The trick is to practise when you are feeling relatively ok and feel safe, so when you start to feel uncomfortable you can take a single deep breath, really feeling your abdomen pushing out, which will quickly rebalance your blood oxygen levels and let you breath easily again.</p>
<p><strong>4. Making It All About Your Panic Attacks</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy, I know, if you are suffering from panic and anxiety to let it completely overtake your life. After all, every little thing you do must be planned and your feelings taken into account which turns every activity into a major event. Make today the last day this happens. Take time to project your interest and attention onto something else, maybe a hobby you used to like doing, reading a book you have been meaning to get round to, constructing the Taj Mahal out of matchsticks, whatever you once spent hours being immersed in without a second thought. Make a special effort to acquire the materials needed to direct your attention away from yourself. Phone some friends and resist the temptation to talk about yourself. Genuinely engaging with others has a profoundly healing effect on you and those around you who may be feeling neglected while you have been busy coping with your own feelings. Do one thing today that has nothing to do with your panic.</p>
<p><strong>5. Being Too Hard On Yourself</strong></p>
<p>People who suffer from panic attacks constantly berate themselves for being weak and wimpy and this is just not the case. You are managing to manifest some major psychosomatic symptoms and that&#8217;s powerful reality creation. Just think what you could do if your conscious and unconscious minds were working together, wow! Be kind to yourself, even forgive yourself for what is happening right now and know that you have the strength to do something about this. And remember, while you are recovering do not push yourself or feel you have to do everything you are asked to prove yourself. Your biggest strength lies in being able to say NO loudly and without guilt.</p>

<p>Evolution is the theory of natural selection. It is often referred to as survival of the fittest, but in truth it is the survival of those that are most adapted to their environment. On the great plains of Africa, for example, giraffes have evolved long necks in order to get first choice of the delicious leaves that are high up away from the other animals. Evolution occurs because in every species there is a degree of variation and over time the variants that are most suited to the environment are more likely to survive to the point that they can pass on their genes to the next generation. If we go back to our example then, in a family of giraffes two children will have slightly different length necks. If we say that the giraffe with the smaller neck has an 80% chance of surviving to the point where it can have children of its own then the giraffe with the slightly longer neck might have an 81% chance due to its slight advantage at reaching food in its environment. Then the children of that giraffe will have neck lengths that are a natural variation of the genes that were passed on. Over millions of years, this means that the giraffe’s neck would get longer and longer as a species. If the environment were to change then so would the course of the giraffe’s evolution.</p>
<p>So what were humans doing during this period? The earliest humans were carnivorous hunter-gatherers. The problem was that much of what we ate was very dangerous to catch. We had to survive in a harsh environment in which what we hunted also wanted to make us the hunted. There are various ways in which we evolved to adapt to this challenge. Some creatures evolved their own defences, such as spikes, claws or razor-sharp teeth. What we did instead was to become social beings. We hunted in packs and evolved ever more complex forms of communication and tools that enabled us to defeat our opponents. As the first creatures to reach this point of evolution, we were then able to dominate the planet with our own form of technology and organisation. That explains how we successfully became hunters, but now how we successfully avoided being the hunted.</p>
<p>To do that we would have needed a body that had a super-fast reaction to a perceived threat that enabled us to remove ourselves from danger before being attacked. This is what is called the fight or flight response or, to us, a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>. Natural variation meant that some humans were born with a better fight or flight response than others. Those that couldn’t panic fast enough simply had a lower chance of surviving to the point of passing on their genes. This is why panic disorders often run in families and why doctors believe that anxiety is to a large extent hereditary.</p>
<p>Over time the panic response became faster, more efficient and better adapted to our environment with all its potential dangers. At the immediate onset of a perceived danger, the body would launch itself into its panic response by shooting up the heart rate so that the body could take immediate high energy action, focusing the mind so that the individual was fully alert to the danger and could take decisive action and pause all non-urgent bodily functions, such as the processing of food, so that the body is fully devoted to the task of avoiding the danger. The latter also explains why people feel nauseous during a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>. At the same time, the body is being flooded with a store of hormones, particularly epinephrine, which gives us adrenaline. An important point to note at this stage is that this process can not be continued for a sustained period of time and so all <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> must come to an end sooner or later.</p>
<p>Humans of today can thank their ancestors for inheriting that function that continues to keep them out of danger. Of course, natural variation still exists today. There are giraffes with all kinds of different necks and there are also humans with different functioning panic responses. There are some people whose <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> do not work to the extent that they should do and this can cause problems for them in their life if they are ever faced with a potential danger. If you are walking through the jungle and come face to face with a hungry lion, it does not matter how much you want to get away from the lion because if your panic response is not up to scratch your body may not be able to escape the situation without launching into that mode.</p>
<p>On the other side of the spectrum of natural variation is you and me. Our panic attacks are too frequent and too intense for what is required. In earlier times when we were developing this ability as a species we would have been the strongest who evolution would have favoured, but now they are not suited to our environment. As a result, we say that we “suffer” from panic attacks and that we want to “get rid of them” or “beat them”, but is this what we really want? A panic disorder is a bit like a faulty smoke alarm. It is there for a very good reason, which is to protect you from danger, but now it is activating when there is no danger. So what do we do about it? Rarely do we say that we need to smash the smoke alarm or get rid of it completely, because we still want it to go off when the house has caught fire or we’ve simply burnt the toast. The purpose of this book therefore is not to stop your body from ever having the ability to enter into this state.  It is instead to improve the functioning of your panic response, so that the only time that you do experience them you are very grateful that you did in that situation.</p>

It is an active factor and when too much acid is prduce in the body, it makes us active, alert and restless. When it stimulates our brains, it make it think that there is danger thus sending out signals to our body to react automatically as if there is a danger. So, the advise here is to cultivate a healthy eating habit and be mindful of what you consume to keep yourself balance internally.</p>
<p><u><strong>Psychotherapy </strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy</strong> such as cognitive behavior therapy is an effective technique use to change our thinking pattern.

<p>When you are in the throes of a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>, the situation can be very scary.</p>
<p>In fact, if you have never experienced this before, you may wonder if you are having a heart attack or going to die. <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attacks</a> can be extremely difficult to deal with, even when you do completely understand what is happening.  When you visit a doctor about the symptoms they love to prescribe drugs for the problem.</p>
<p>You can, however, learn how to <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome panic</a> attacks without the use of dangerous medications. There are ways to manage and reduce your symptoms.</p>
<p>The first step is to also learn how to recognize triggers and head them off before you experience a full blown attack.</p>
<p>First, you really need to recognize the symptoms of a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>. This could include excessive sweating, nausea, very fast heart rate, cramping, chest pains and hyperventilating.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just a short list and it&#8217;s possible that you also have other symptoms as well. The first thing to do is track what your own symptoms are so that you can better manage. Then you can take steps on how to <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcome panic</a> attacks.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t feel embarrassed if you initially think that your symptoms are something more serious. If you do suspect you are in the throes of a heart attack, only to discover you have a panic disorder, take it as a learning experience. You will have received a proper diagnosis and will be able to move on from there.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help.There are several things that will probably be an option for you in seeking treatment.</p>
<p>First, there are medications available for managing the symptoms. However, you can actually become dependent on pharmaceutical drugs, so only use them as a temporary or emergency measure.</p>
<p>Many believe that better alternatives on how to overcome <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> include herbs, relaxation techniques and cognitive behavior therapy.</p>
<p>The latter actually helps you break down why you are reacting to stressors the way you are and reprogram yourself to respond in a more healthy way.</p>
<p>Many people also get relief from talk or group therapy.</p>
<p>Herbs that have been known to help include St. John&#8217;s Wort, Valerian root and even homeopathic preparations. Use caution with herbal use because of many undocumented side-effects and unpredictable reactions to prescription medications you may be taking.</p>
<p>When you experience a panic attack, your body feels out of control. You feel afraid, shaky and unsure. It can be an absolutely debilitating condition.</p>
<p>However, you can learn how to overcome panic attacks. Don&#8217;t be afraid to seek help.</p>
<p>Explore your treatment options with your doctor or health provider. Ask you physician if he/she will support you first trying natural remedies before moving to medications, except for short term or emergency treatment.</p>
<p>You can gain relief through natural techniques and therapy. Perhaps even through herbal supplements, if your doctor approves. By understanding your condition, you can obtain lasting relief when you learn how to overcome panic attacks with a method or technique that works for you.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> feels like a sudden wave of fear that crash on us without any warning and reason. Such scenario often leave people feeling confused and scared of the experience because it seems to be unexplainable and scary.</p>
<p>It is like your world had become black, evil and frightening. People often feel alone and depress because they felt like they are being trapped in a situation without any reasons. It is indeed an unfair experience that can mess a person&#8217;s life. It stop them from doing activities they enjoy, like hanging out with friends, going out for a walk and other simple things to enjoy in life.</p>
<p>Here are some tips on <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcoming panic</a> attacks so that you will become stronger than the fear inside you and destroy it for good.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate stress and possible causes of stress </strong></p>
<p>Stress comes from all sorts of direction. It can come from school, from gatherings, from driving, from work and even being in a wrong environment that does not suit you. Lifestyle for many of us have gone on the fast lane. Everything, everyone you see are rushing all the time. It can be overwhelming and create a phobia if you are already stressed and be in such busy places. Remove yourself from the environment and find your quiet spot to calm down.</p>
<p><strong>Eat well </strong></p>
<p>Study have shown that not being mindful with your meals can cause an internal imbalance in your body. Imbalance includes the chemicals in your body are not at the right levels, your body pH is more acidic than it should be and it affects the production of natural chemicals in your body. All these travels around inside your body including your brain. Your brain is very sensitive and reacts easily when the stimulants reaches it. Lactic acid is a stimulant to our brains and body. It is an active factor and when too much acid is produce in the body, it makes us active, alert and restless. When it stimulates our brains, it make it think that there is danger thus sending out signals to our body to react automatically as if there is a danger. So, the advise here is to cultivate a healthy eating habit and be mindful of what you consume to keep yourself balance internally.</p>
<p><strong>Psychotherapy </strong></p>
<p>Psychotherapy such as cognitive behavior therapy is an effective technique use to change our thinking pattern. It is not hypnosis and such but simply to untangle the wrong and false beliefs that we had the habit of believing and seeing more clearly in our judgement. By requiring our thoughts, we can gain more control and handle <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> and anxiety. Over time, as we gain more strength and mastery over thoughts control, we can automatically shut off <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> completely when it comes around.</p>
<p>All these are the natural and safe new treatments for <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>; and it is all drugs-free. Psychotherapy is the best and most effective approach so far that has helped many people cured from their panic attacks. Learn more about it as it is very beneficial and can set you free from the rut.</p>

<p>That is not only sad, it is dangerous because continually suffering with <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> can lead to anxiety disorder (the constant fear of having another anxiety attack). When this happens all life decisions are ruled by the fear of suffering yet another attack.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this can damage your lifestyle, friendships, love-life and even threaten job performance.</p>
<p>This results of <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> are that the sufferer will often withdraw from normal everyday activities, such as:</p>
<p>* Planning holidays or travel.</p>
<p>* Leaving your home, or being alone.</p>
<p>* Making appointments or socializing with people, for fear that you might have to excuse yourself half way through.</p>
<p>* Giving a speech or presentation, for fear of having a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>.</p>
<p>Common Symptoms Of A <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic Attack</a></p>
<p>If you are unsure whether you, or someone you love is suffering with a panic attack, then here are some common symptoms that you should look for:</p>
<p>* A Racing Heart</p>
<p>* Chest Pain</p>
<p>* Palpitations</p>
<p>* Difficulty breathing</p>
<p>* Headaches</p>
<p>* Sweats</p>
<p>* Bowel Troubles</p>
<p>* Nausea</p>
<p>* General Fatigue</p>
<p>* Dizziness</p>
<p>* Insomnia</p>
<p>* Butterflies in the Stomach</p>
<p>* Difficulty Swallowing</p>
<p>* Constant Fear Of Impending Doom</p>
<p>* Depression</p>
<p>* <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/agoraphobia/overcoming-agoraphobia/" >Agoraphobia</a></p>
<p>* Sudden Panic</p>
<p>* Irritability</p>
<p>* Social Nervousness</p>
<p>* Feelings Like You Are Going Crazy Or Losing Control</p>
<p>* Feeling Alone And Out Of Place</p>
<p>* Believing That There Is No Hope Of Normality</p>
<p>* Social Phobia</p>
<p>* Disturbing Dreams And Thoughts</p>
<p>This is not a complete list but any combination of the symptoms mentioned there should very well point to panic attack as the cause. If you are suffering with these symptoms you should take action to get your attacks under control before they increase in frequency.</p>
<p>Immediate Action You Can Take To Help Panic Attacks</p>
<p>Many people have found it helpful to learn what can exacerbate anxiety and lead to panic attacks. Simple items such as food can amplify anxiety, or make a panic attack much more probable.</p>
<p>Foods like:</p>
<p>1 Processed Foods (lunch meats, chips, packaged snacks)</p>
<p>2 Caffeine (in coffee, tea, chocolate)</p>
<p>3 Energy Drinks (Red Bull, Monster, Rockstar etc.)</p>
<p>4 Sugar (in the form of sucrose, glucose, corn syrup)</p>
<p>The Truth About Alcohol And Panic Attacks</p>
<p>Though having a stiff drink may seem like an obvious way to “calm the nerves,” you need to understand that alcohol dehydrates the body and this causes the body to feel tired and fatigued. It also reduces blood sugar levels and causes vitamin depletion as well.</p>
<p>Even though you may feel relaxed, after it wears off, anxiety may actually get worse.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a>, then you will know the person usually suffers from physical health problems such as diseases. People who suffers from <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a> lacks mental and emotional strength and are easily tired. Our body, mind and soul are inter-related and when our emotions and mental heal are not well, it affects us causing us to fall sick as well. <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attack</a> causes the body to gets tired easily because our body releases a lot of negative chemicals that are not beneficial to us. Other than that, panic attack causes the body to easily catch diseases because our immune system becomes weak.</p>
<p>Some of the physical symptoms that panic attack causes the body to experience includes, rashes, stomach upset, lost of appetite, aches, and pains at the joints. When our body is weak, it produce very little stimulant that helps maintain the immune system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attacks</a> usually triggers the body alarm system that is known as the fight-or-flight, which is a natural reaction to danger. When it is triggered by the false alarms of panic attacks our body tends to show physical symptoms such as sweating, increase of heart beats, chest pain, nausea and extreme shaking that is hard to control.</p>
<p>Panic attacks affects the nervous system which is why some of the symptoms are not easily controlled. For example shaking and twitching cannot be stopped immediately as it is controlled by the nerves. So the only way to stop it is through going a sequence by calming the nerves so that it stops the shaking.</p>
<p>Internally, panic attacks causes the body to produce more active stimulants that makes the more body more acidic. When this happens, it causes imbalance of pH in the body and the brain. The brain is the central control of our whole being and it very sensitive. If the brain is affected then it will send out wrong messages to the body such as informing of false fears.</p>
<p>When the body receive of the false alarms, it quickly reacts and put up its defense procedure such as increase the adrenaline, heart beats and makes the person very alert and restless. When the danger sent by the brain is false, and the whole body gets worked up, then the person is being very alert of a danger that is actually not true.</p>
<p>This condition is what usually happens to the person who experience panic attacks and it is why the <strong>cognitive behavior technique(CBT)</strong> teaches the method that heals from the thoughts pattern because it all starts from the brain.You can learn more about the available <strong>CBT</strong> programs that are available to not just manage panic attacks but to cure from it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attacks</a> symptoms can be very confusing. They include weird feelings, you have no idea what&#8217;s going on, where they come from and why this is happening to you. <strong>Panic attacks can be confused with a nervous breakdown, heart attack, general anxiety and more</strong>. This guide will help you find out if you suffer from panic disorder or is it actually something else.</p>
<p><u>Hyperventilation</u></p>
<p>Do you feel that you breathe faster than you need? Short of breath? This is called hyperventilation. When this happens, the brain gets less oxygen than needed. The result: your vision blurs, you can feel dizzy, anxious, nervous and tense. You may also feel like crying and worst of all – suffocating. Than you get the need to breathe more deeply, which makes the condition worse. This causes feelings of numbness or cold feet, chest pain and trembling and tingling in your fingers and feet. It&#8217;s very frightening. Many people get so freaked out, they run to the emergency room immediately.</p>
<p><strong><u>Dizziness </u></strong></p>
<p>Do you feel suddenly light-headed or dizzy? Many times you may also feel unable to balance, like you&#8217;re sea sick. You may also feel like you are going to faint right now and that the world is spinning. This is usually caused by the hyperventilation but not always. When you think you will faint you get even more afraid which elevates the panic. This can continue for hours or just minutes.</p>
<p><u>Chest pain, Palpitations, Irregular Heart Beats</u></p>
<p>Chest pain is probably the most frightening one of the <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> symptoms. Most people that experience this are sure they are going through a heart attack. Your heart beats real fast and the chest muscles feel very tight. The added fear causes more false heart attack symptoms like sweating, numbness in the arms and palpitations. Sometimes you can feel irregular heart beats, or skipped beats. The chest pain you feel is caused by the tensed muscles in your chest and not by a heart attack.</p>
<p><u>Other Panic Attacks Symptoms Are:</u><br />
·        Throat thickening, choking feeling<br />
·        Blurred vision, sensitivity to light, itchy eyes<br />
·        Ringing in your ears<br />
·        Digestive system/Nausea<br />
·        Nausea and digestion problems<br />
·        Metallic taste in the mouth or ammonia taste or smell<br />
·        Sudden urge to go to the toilet, frequent urination<br />
·        Stiffness in the muscles, muscle twitching<br />
·        Shaking or trembling<br />
·        Feeling chilled, cold sweating<br />
·        Tingling in hands and feet, numbness<br />
·        Headaches<br />
·        Depersonalization, Derealization, Feeling of unreality<br />
·        Fear of losing your mind, fear you are going to die, losing control<br />
·        Chronic fatigue<br />
·        Being afraid to get out of the house, seeing people<br />
·        Dry mouth<br />
·        Mood swings<br />
·        Panic in the middle of the night, bad dreams<br />
·        Obsessive thoughts, trouble concentrating<br />
·        Sugar cravings constantly<br />
·        Weak legs<br />
<u>What Causes Panic Attacks Symptoms?</u></p>
<p>The reasons for panic attacks are not yet fully known. Some studies found that a combination of reasons are involved, some of them are: abnormalities in the brain (Chemical problems in some parts of the brain), family genetics (it&#8217;s known to run in families) and constant major stress or post traumatic syndrome (major life transitions, death of spouse or family member).</p>
<p><u>What Can You Do About It?</u></p>
<p>If the symptoms listed above apply to you, you may be suffering from panic attacks. There are many different ways to treat panic disorder: medication, herbal remedies, breathing techniques, counseling and supplements are some of them.</p>
<p>The best way to treat panic attacks symptoms is <strong>to achieve a real cure by treating the root and causes of the problem.</strong> This can be achieved by cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>

<p>Find the trigger.</p>
<p>All <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attacks</a> have a trigger.  Find out what yours is . <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attacks</a> usually occur during times of stress or times when you feel helpless or confined.  Closed spaces and small quarters, for example, can trigger a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>.  So will the thought of facing a group of people whether for a meeting, presentation or public speech.</p>
<p>Learn to find the pattern of occurrence of your attacks and you’ll be better at predicting them.  If you know what causes your panic attacks, you can better prepare for them before they occur and be able to control panic attacks and your negative feelings.</p>
<p>Learn relaxation techniques.</p>
<p>Relaxation techniques help train the mind to control itself in situations where panic attacks usually occur.  By learning to relax, you teach your body to follow your mind and control panic attacks. </p>
<p>Learn meditation or self-hypnosis, which are both effective for helping you clear your mind and reduce muscle tension and heart rate. They also work well with helping you gain better control of your breathing and your reactions in case of another <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>.  Practice these techniques for at least 20 minutes everyday to control panic attacks.</p>
<p>Learn to breathe properly.</p>
<p>Breathing is the key to learning how to control panic attacks.  Learn the proper technique by lying on a flat surface or sitting on a chair.  By keeping your spine straight and closing your eyes, picture your diaphragm as your center. </p>
<p>Place a hand over the area and draw in a breath slowly, using a count of 5 and then breathe out slowly.  Repeat this for at least 20 times until you find your rhythm and your body begins to relax.  During this exercise, think of being in a peaceful and safe place and repeat to yourself reassuring statements such as, ”I am in a safe place.  Nothing will harm me.  There is no danger to my person.  I am safe.”</p>
<p>Next time a panic attack threatens you, use this breathing technique to calm yourself.  Regardless of where you are, remember this technique and use it to control panic attacks.</p>
<p>Check your diet.</p>
<p>Diet plays a big part in making you more susceptible to panic and anxiety attacks.  Certain foods like caffeine, salt and nicotine for example, should be taken in moderation.  Caffeine and nicotine are known stimulants and can increase your nervousness and agitation while salt hinders the normal functioning of the nervous system.</p>
<p>Get enough sleep.</p>
<p>If you suffer from panic attacks, make sure you get a good rest every night.  If your body is well rested, your mental and physical abilities are more in tuned to each other when you wake up. You are less likely to react without thinking or give in to panic attacks if you’re refreshed and feeling in control. </p>
<p>See a doctor.</p>
<p>If your panic attacks are severe, it might be time to seek professional help to control panic attacks. Some symptoms can be too much even for you to handle, in which case you might benefit from prescription medication or even professional counseling to control panic attacks. Don’t be afraid to seek help. You are not alone in your condition and there are a lot of sources you can turn to for assistance if you will only ask.</p>

<p>The Major Mistakes that People with <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic Attacks</a> are Making.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >Panic attacks</a> can be extremely traumatic and people who experience them often say that they would do anything to get rid of them. In actual fact however, many people with panic attacks are inadvertently doing things that are directly and indirectly fuelling further panic attacks.</p>
<p>The following are the biggest mistakes that people with panic attacks make in their daily lives. By cutting these out, we can all experience a dramatic reduction in the frequency, duration and intensity of panic attacks.</p>
<p>Some of the most fascinating research into panic attacks that has been revealed recently has shown that a lack of assertiveness in interactions with others is a major contributing factor to the development of a panic disorder, rather than as a consequence of them. It has long been noted that people with panic attacks tend to be politer than average, but it has now been discovered that this leads to panic attacks because it makes people over analyse themselves too much and caught in a cycle of trying to please others too much. Instead, it’s time to take charge and assert yourself more and more in daily life, which will also boost your own self-confidence and respect.</p>
<p>Incorrect breathing is also a major factor that far too many people are making. To test yourself, simply place one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach and take a deep breath. If the hand on your chest moves more than the one on your stomach then you are not employing proper diaphragm breathing, but are instead are continuously making yourself more anxious.</p>
<p>Next up is the habit of confusing healthy physical sensations with dangerous ones, which sets off false alarms in your body to induce the panic response. Physical exertion, normal bodily functions and even a sense of excitement can all be given the worst possible interpretation by someone suffering from panic attacks.</p>
<p>Many people with panic attacks choose to think that they have no control over their body and this is another major factor in fuelling panic attacks because people are left thinking that they are trapped in their own body. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. Millions of people have overcome their panic attacks and moved on with their lives and there’s no reason why any one person’s case is special and not able to be cured.</p>
<p>The most obvious, often done mistake (but also the easiest to stop) is consuming food and drink that make you more anxious and prone to panic attacks. Panic attacks are centred upon the nervous system, therefore we must eat foods that are rich in vitamin Bs because they directly nourish and strengthen the nervous system, which produces calming effects. More specifically within the B group of vitamins, you’ll find that Vitamin B12, Thiamin and Niacin can make you much more resistant to the experience of a <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today" >panic attack</a>.</p>
<p>A recommended balanced diet, specifically for someone who suffers from panic attacks therefore, would consist of 20% meat, poultry, seafood, cheese, eggs and tofu. Then, 35% of baked potato, broccoli, asparagus, peanuts, legumes, watermelons and oranges. Then 45% would consist of brown rice, whole grain cereal, pasta, wheat germ, oatmeal and bread.</p>
<p>Finally, a fundamental mistake that many make is not seeking help. Medical practitioners estimate that the majority of people who suffer from panic attacks do not ask for help. Unfortunately, many of them are only discovered by the health system when they develop an even worse condition as a result of letting their panic disorder get out of hand, such as alcoholism, substance abuse, <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/agoraphobia/overcoming-agoraphobia/" >agoraphobia</a> or OCD. Instead of spending a fortune on therapy however, the Panic Defence Handbook remains the most complete guide to <a href="http://www.stopanxietystoppanic.com/today"  rel='nofollow' >overcoming panic</a> attacks once and for all.
