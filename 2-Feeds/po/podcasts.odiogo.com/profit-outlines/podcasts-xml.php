      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://profitoutlines.com/Go/GoogleManipulator"><img src="http://profitoutlines.com/guides/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/google-manipulator.jpg" alt="" title="google-manipulator" width="192" height="236" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-69" align="left" border="0" style="margin: 10px;" /></a>  As a marketer you know it&#8217;s a fact =  Search engine traffic converts.  Plain and simple and the top dog when it comes to search engine traffic is Google.  Yeah, I know&#8230;another fact.  </p>
<p>There are two ways to get traffic from Google&#8217;s search engine results: 1 - Buy it via AdWords and 2 - Get your website to rank well for the keywords related to your niche.  Of course, buying the traffic is the easiest but it can get extremely expensive if you&#8217;re bidding on competitive keywords and phrases.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, in my opinion, the second option is the best.  Free search engine traffic, targeted to your site and what you&#8217;re offering - frankly, I don&#8217;t think there is anything more profitable in these regards.  The only problem is, how do you do it and do it consistently?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where <a href="http://profitoutlines.com/Go/GoogleManipulator">Google Manipulator</a> comes in&#8230;.<br />
<span id="more-68"></span><br />

</center></p>
<p>See, there are people who have ranking well in Google down to an exact science.  I mean they can get pretty much any page they want, on any terms they want - ranked well in the search results and ranking well in search results means traffic: Lots of Traffic.</p>
<p>Pawel Reszka is one of those guys!  He&#8217;s been at it a long time and has proven himself as one of the top guys when it comes to getting good rankings in Google.  By proven himself, I mean to say he gets his stuff ranked well and he has put together guides that others have followed to get their stuff to rank well.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to be able to get those solid, good rankings in Google for your sites and products but when you can teach people how you do it and they succeed as well - then you clearly have your stuff together and know what you&#8217;re talking about and Pawel Reszka does.</p>
<p>His latest guide is <a href="http://profitoutlines.com/Go/GoogleManipulator">Google Manipulator</a> and in it he shares with you the secrets that work for him to get high up in the search results.  That&#8217;s quite different from others in his field, sure they&#8217;ll sell you a guide and it will probably help you out but at the same time - they don&#8217;t tell you everything.  Pawel does.</p>
<p>In the Google Manipulator Course he provides you with a system that has been tested and proven to get good rankings, but that&#8217;s not all - this course will guide you step by step (by the hand, if you will) through the process of good search engine ranking.</p>
<p>Not only does he teach you how the key things to getting free search engine traffic, but he goes much further than that.  He shows you how to be a solid marketer as well.</p>
<p>Even more, he shows you how to find niches that are virtually untouched and not any ol&#8217; niches either - these are niches that people spend money in but marketers for some reason or another haven&#8217;t really marketed them.  You&#8217;ll also find out the ONE thing you should really avoid when deciding on a niche to enter.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also learn how to dig down and find those really profitable long tail key phrases that buyers use to search for the items you&#8217;re selling.  Other things you&#8217;ll get out of this guide are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proven Cash Making strategies
<li>Profitable Web 2.0 sites
<li>Optimizing your pages the right way
<li>How to get ranked in Google within days, not months
<li>Choosing the right domain name
<li>Creating and using Linkbaits
<li>and there is so much more!
</ul>
<p><a href="http://profitoutlines.com/Go/GoogleManipulator">Google Manipulator</a> is really a great guide, written by someone who knows what they&#8217;re talking about.  Whether you&#8217;re an affiliate marketer or you market your own products, you still need to get good rankings in Google to really be able to take your profit making to another level and Google Manipulator shows you exactly how to do that.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A couple of months ago I was fortunate to come across a guide call <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6eoky9" target="_blank">Confessions of a Lazy Super Affiliate</a>.  Wow.</p>
<p>This happens to be one of the best guides I&#8217;ve ever read on affiliate marketing and being a successful affiliate marketer the easy way.</p>
<p>Hell, when you go to that page he even tells you his top 5 traffic generation techniques and he tells them to you for absolutely free - that&#8217;s free as in not having to buy a single thing to read about those techniques.</p>
<p>So far I&#8217;ve been able to implement a few of the things in <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6eoky9" target="_blank">&#8216;Confessions of a Lazy Super Affiliate&#8217;</a> and am seeing some great results!  This is by far one of the best guides I&#8217;ve purchased on the subject of affiliate marketing and am quite happy I took the time to give it a read.</p>
<p>If affiliate marketing happens to be either something your interested in or working on right now, this is one of those guides that could take your efforts to a whole new level.</p>
<p>Check it out here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6eoky9" target="_blank">Confessions of a Lazy Super Affiliate</a></p>
<p>Oh, on a side note, I&#8217;ve also found that he has two other guides out.  I haven&#8217;t had a chance to read these yet but if they&#8217;re anything like Confession, they&#8217;re bound to add even more too one&#8217;s affiliate marketing efforts.</p>
<p>These are :  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6qtbjf" target="_blank">The Conduit Method</a> and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6yfxos" target="_blank">The Reverse Selection Blueprint</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marketing on the Internet, regardless of what you are marketing, is an extremely competitive business.  If you don&#8217;t stay on top of your game, continually learning and implementing you&#8217;ll soon find yourself somewhat lost in the battle.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of staying at the top is to concentrate your efforts on Search Engine Optimization, SEO.  Search engines are perhaps the most profitable and most sought after marketing tools on the Internet today.  Sure, there are plenty of other ways to market your site or your product but many consider search engine traffic as the gold strike.</p>
<p><span id="more-12"></span></p>
<p>It is a well known and researched fact that the majority of web users who search the net only click on the links of the first page of a search.  By default, that is typically the first ten search results.  Getting your website in that first ten for your keywords or phrases increases the likelihood that someone is going to click through to your site and these visitors that come from the search engines bring us the most&#8230;MONEY!!</p>
<p>Optimizing your site to get into the upper results of the search engines involves the daily dedication to working with a variety of the tools and methods that are proven to build a site to its search engine potential.  This is a lot of work and includes many aspects but the results can be amazingly fruitful.</p>
<p>Your first steps in search engine optimization should be to completely familiarize with the keywords and phrases that your target market is likely to use when searching for your products or services.  If you&#8217;re marketing something that has extreme amounts of competition you should also be concentrating on the lesser searched keywords and phrases as well.</p>
<p>Try and look at this way, if you can rank well for ten lesser searched keywords, your traffic will be more and so will your profits than if you&#8217;re ranking poorly for one popularly searched keyword or phrase.</p>
<p>Once you figure out the keywords and phrases you want to optimize your pages for you should then begin building content and pages around those.  Every article, blog post or web page you put up should be concentrated on one keyword phrase or keyword and as you&#8217;re writing this content you will want to keep the words flowing naturally.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to just randomly stick your word or phrase in, this comes off as unprofessionally written and will lower conversions.  In addition, search engines are growing smarter by the day and keyword stuffed pages are quickly finding themselves lost amongst the lower ranked pages.</p>
<p>As with everything involved with Internet Marketing, practice and test and practice and test.  In order to fully reap the great rewards from search engines that a well optimized page can garner, you need to keep a close on what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not.  Ditch what&#8217;s not, improve what is and repeat the cycle and you&#8217;ll soon find yourself climbing the SERPs and pulling in the cash.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a person first gets started in affiliate marketing, or even when a person starts looking into becoming an affiliate marketer they quickly have dollar signs rolling their eyes into the back of their heads.  Everything looks rosy, every looks great and they think that in no time at all the money is going to show up at their door steps in golden wheel barrows.</p>
<p>The fact is that far less than 10% of affiliate marketers hit the mother lode overnight.  The fact is that when you research, visit with or take advantage of advice from successful affiliate marketers you will quickly find they made it to their pedestal through (old fashioned concept here): hard work.<br />
<span id="more-10"></span><br />
Your research has also shown you that one of the best ways to maximize your affiliate marketing efforts is to have your own affiliate website.  Putting together your first affiliate website, particularly if you are new to affiliate marketing, can at first seem a quite daunting task.  However, if you stick to the basics it is really quite simple and combined with your affiliate marketing efforts, rather helpful in filling your first wheel barrow.</p>
<p>First it is important to make a decision on what niche or product or service you are going to be promoting.  Many people, when first starting out, try to overload this by promoting as many different things as possible and end up slowing their affiliate marketing growth process by spreading their jam a little too thin.  Find one niche or product you&#8217;re comfortable with and start profiting with that one before adding another helping of spuds to your plate.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve decided the niche or product you&#8217;re going to start promoting as an affiliate and you&#8217;ve decided you want an affiliate website, it&#8217;s time to choose a domain name.  When you&#8217;re selecting a domain name for affiliate marketing purposes it is important to select one that contains pertinent keywords to what you&#8217;re going to be promoting.  This will help with better search engine listings and help return visitors remember your website.</p>
<p>Alright, so now you have your niche and your domain name.  You need a place to host your affiliate marketing website.  It is my opinion that hosting is the single most important aspect of your online business.  Without a reliable host, your Internet business will not succeed whether your an affiliate marketer or marketing your own products.  When you choose a web host, don&#8217;t simply take their word for their guarantees.  Spend some quality time reading reviews on web hosting and Internet marketing related forums.</p>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s get this sucker built.  If you have the funds available and have absolutely no knowledge of how to build a website you may want to consider outsourcing the work, however, it is always a good thing to know a little bit about what goes into this process.  So, if time permits it&#8217;s a good thing to build your first site yourself.  There are a ton of different resources on the Internet that easily guide you through this process.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re building, or having built, any website you will want to make sure it contains solid and keyword rich content.  The content of your affiliate website serves dual purposes.  First, it sells whatever it is you have decided to sell and secondly, it&#8217;s the food search engines feed on.  Both are equally important as it doesn&#8217;t do you any good to get visitors if you can&#8217;t close the sale and it doesn&#8217;t do you any good to have killer selling techniques if you can&#8217;t bring in the visitors.</p>
<p>Your website should also be as simple as you can possibly make it without giving the impression of a half-assed job.  The goal is to have a quick loading website with easily accessible information that looks professional, clean and is clutter free.  Sure, it&#8217;s nice to fill your pages with all of the latest technology and the bells and the whistles but if it isn&#8217;t necessary to enhance your affiliate marketing techniques it&#8217;s just one more thing between your customer and the sales link or order button.</p>
<p>After you have built your first website for affiliate marketing purposes and start promoting it.  Stay attuned to your stats and to what is working and what isn&#8217;t.  Test, revise and test some more until you hit the combination that provides you the sales you expect you should be making.  Once you&#8217;ve successfully reached your goals with this affiliate website, then if you have the desire to move on and promote other products and services you&#8217;ll have your own road map to follow.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As with everything a plan will help you not only be more efficient but will also help you maximize your marketing efforts and help get more revenue out of your website it is important to first put into place a plan of action in regards to your websites design.<br />
<span id="more-9"></span><br />
- If you&#8217;re main purpose of building your website is for revenue purposes you should always keep asking yourself if a certain aspect will increase your revenue or will it harm the revenue potential of your website.  If you are unsure, test it.</p>
<p>- Evaluate which links will make you more money and which links will not.  When planning my website I like to make sure that as many as possible of my outgoing links are income generating links.  Ask yourself if it&#8217;s a link trade link, does the trade sufficiently benefit you by bringing in enough relevant traffic or back link to justify giving up that space on your page to a non-income generating link?</p>
<p>- Try and plan your website to keep the ads above the proverbial fold.  This is tricky because you want your website visitors to see both the worth of being at your site and your income generating links.  Plan your website so the very first item a person sees is an income generating link but try and be prudent about giving your visitor the information they came to without cluttering the space with ads.</p>
<p>These three quick tips are fairly quite obvious but sometimes often overlooked in the planning stages of a website.  Hopefully they help ya&#8217; out.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s long been a rather well known marketing strategy that some have employed, some have overlooked because they simply don&#8217;t want to take the time to do it and others, well&#8230;simply haven&#8217;t heard of it.</p>
<p>But marketing via forums can be one of the most effective money making strategies an online marketer can undertake.</p>
<p><span id="more-6"></span></p>
<p>With that being said, there are ways to go about and there are also ways to not go about it.  In his latest masterpiece Dominic Lee explains over the course 52 pages, in detail, how he has taken forum marketing and exploded into a major influx of cash for his business.</p>
<p>His guide, like any guide reviewed here at ProfitOutlines.com, is pretty much crap errr&#8230;fluff free and takes you from through the entire process from beginning to end.  With the exception of a few pictures of himself and a party he threw after his first successful forum venture, you&#8217;ll get all the information you need to incorporate forum marketing into your business.</p>
<p>Dominic starts out with a quick overview of his perception of the makeup of the variety of members of two of the top webmaster and marketing forums on the net (The Warrior Forum &amp; The Digital Point Forums), then a quick shot of information in regards to creating your product and then it&#8217;s off to the races and details about making money with forum marketing.</p>
<p>Although this guide is primarily focused on cashing in on the WSO, the information is priceless and will work fabulously on any forum that offers a section for selling.  The most important parts of this title deal with creating your sales post effectively, tips and techniques to create forum buzz for your product and other secrets he&#8217;s unfolded in regards to building your list and selling your products via forums.</p>
<p>All of the information he provides is based on his personal, first hand experience and backs up what he knows by running successful WSO&#8217;s at the Warrior Forum and after reading Overnight Forum Cash you&#8217;ll understand why they are successful.</p>
<p>If you implement even a partial amount of the strategies he outlines, you will have a hard time not making money with your forum marketing.</p>
