I wanted to personally thank you for watching the Sequential SEO strategy we have created for you. The zip file with the video and pdf slides are located below with giveaway rights. Please read the giveaway rights before distributing this strategy on your own website.<br />
<br />
Also, many people ask me about the Back linking tools we personally use in our company. As you know, I mentioned One Hour Back links, but for more ongoing back links and to be able to actually back link our affiliate links as well, I use <a href='http://www.thetrafficbrain.com/member/?r=1065&#038;i=3'>The Traffic Brain</a><br />
<br />
<a href='http://www.thetrafficbrain.com/member/?r=1065&#038;i=3'>The Traffic Brain</a> was created by Howie Schwartz and it has always proved to give us extraordinary results for a very low monthly cost. BUT&#8230; they DO limit the the amount of users who can have access at any given time.<br />
<br />
So, if you would like to have access to <a href='http://www.thetrafficbrain.com/member/?r=1065&#038;i=3'>The Traffic Brain,</a> please be sure to click <a href="http://www.thetrafficbrain.com/member/?r=1065&#038;i=3">this link</a> to get yours TODAY!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></center></p>
<p>Hey there</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Bob.</p>
<p>So, Mike Silva and I have been working tirelessly on creating a product<br />
launch, for the most part will create quite a stir on the Internet.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m not selling you anything in this email, I just want to<br />
explain what we go through when we do something bigger than ourselves.</p>
<p>The launch is for a Warrior Special Offer (WSO) on the Warrior Forum. Over<br />
the past week, Mike has re-written the entire Content Multiplier in e book<br />
format, 100% revised</p>
<p>Step one complete <img src='http://thewestprogram.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Step two was, figure out what we could give as AMAZING value for all who<br />
purchase.</p>
<p>That was simple, so we added Master Resell Rights for anyone who purchases<br />
so they can also sell it and keep 100% of the profits.</p>
<p>Our second component to the product was to go WAY overboard with value, so<br />
we are giving each person who purchases the Content Multiplier access to<br />
the recorded WEST Archives&#8230; and the rights to give it away when they<br />
resell the Content Multiplier, as well as they can transfer over MRR to the<br />
product as well.</p>
<p>Step two complete <img src='http://thewestprogram.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Next up was to get a serious review of our product. Not asking for a bunch<br />
of testimonials or asking people to promote our stuff, but a serious<br />
critique of the product. So we asked the veterans in the Industry, Willie<br />
Crawford, Paul Counts and Micheal Savoie.</p>
<p>We didn&#8217;t expect the response (by the way, this is a long email that is<br />
laying out an entire launch strategy so you may want to print it up and<br />
save it, keep reading)</p>
<p>===================================<br />
Willie Crawford&#8217;s Response</p>
<p>===================================</p>
<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>I actually LOVED your product and look<br />
forward to promoting it. Please let me<br />
know when it&#8217;s up as a WSO since I don&#8217;t<br />
get over to The Warrior Forum as often as<br />
I use to.</p>
<p>Willie</p>
<p>If you need a testimonial, here&#8217;s one:</p>
<p>Bob, The Content Multiplier certainly lives<br />
up to it&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>Anyone can take this step-by-step blueprint,<br />
create high-quality content, distribute it in<br />
literally hundreds of places that MATTER, and<br />
pull in traffic from all over the internet.</p>
<p>You pointed out resources (most of them 100%<br />
free) that it would take the average content<br />
marketers YEARS to stumble across on their own.<br />
I&#8217;ve been creating articles, ebooks, books,<br />
videos, audios, press releases, etc. for 15 years<br />
now, and you showed me a ton of resources that I<br />
hadn&#8217;t noticed, and will definitely use.</p>
<p>Since you teach people how to actually create<br />
and distribute quality content, it&#8217;s going to<br />
attract pre-sold visitors, and the websites<br />
that you distribute the content on (as well as<br />
the search engines) are going to love this<br />
content for a long time.</p>
<p>Thank you for laying out a plan that will work<br />
long-term. A person can focus on implementing<br />
your blueprint KNOWING that it will work today,<br />
and more-importantly, that their efforts will<br />
continue paying off long into the future.</p>

<p>Hey Bob,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing this. That is one awesome report! Here is a testimonial<br />
from me that you can use:</p>
<p>=====BEGIN TESTIMONIAL=====</p>
<p>&#8220;This report is full of meat and actionable content! If you take action on<br />
this simple strategy you can&#8217;t help but see traffic no matter what niche<br />
you are promoting. I have used similar methods before to get massive<br />
traffic, but I haven&#8217;t used everything mentioned here in this report so I<br />
know I was leaving good traffic on the table.</p>
<p>I will be recommending this to my subscribers and coaching students. It is<br />
an incredible ebook. I found that it was easy to read, follow, and<br />
implement. Even though many consider me an expert on traffic generation I<br />
still learned some things in here!</p>
<p>Here are just 2 easy ways to act on the content in side.</p>
<p>1) Just hand this report to your virtual assistant and have them go to town<br />
as it is very well explained. If you are someone that is running out of<br />
things to have your outsourcers do than hand them this report!</p>
<p>2) Sell this service to offline businesses for $750 to $1,000 each and<br />
watch their jaws drop when they get multiple first page listings. You would<br />
become the hot commodity in your town if you implemented this method.</p>
<p>I am not getting paid to say this, but I just get behind products that work<br />
and that are full of quality content!</p>
<p>For the price you can&#8217;t beat it! Grab it now!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;-&gt; Paul Counts</p>
<p>=====END TESTIMONIAL=====</p>
<p>I will also be glad to promote this to my email lists as well. Let me know<br />
when you launch it or are about to so I can get the affiliate link and send<br />
out for you.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

Micheal Savoie&#8217;s Response<br />
=================================</p>
<p>Looking Good!</p>
<p>Testimonial:<br />
Bob &amp; Mike! First of all, I wanted to thank you for the review copy of<br />
Content Multiplier. This is really good material! I have been using a<br />
portion of these tools for turning my content into traffic, but you have<br />
put this into a blueprint that anyone can follow (I especially like the way<br />
you broke it down into days for those of us who like to schedule<br />
everything) so that content will no longer be an issue. Once I started<br />
following the steps, I immediately found that I had way more content than I<br />
had ever created while still working the same amount of time. This<br />
impressed me a lot! I hope to be able to discuss this with the listeners on<br />
my show very soon!</p>
<p>Anyone buying Content Multiplier will only need to do one thing to get<br />
measurable results: Take Action! With everything laid out step by step,<br />
they have no excuses.</p>
<p>Thanks for a product that does not insult the intelligence of the marketers<br />
who want more content to drive traffic to their money sites. I look forward<br />
to teaching an outsource team to do all of these tasks and really make my<br />
business take off!</p>

<p>======================================================<br />
We also got a FANTASTIC video response from Cate Ferguson<br />
======================================================</p>

<p>Step Three: Complete | RAVING testimonials from a student and leaders in<br />
our industry as well as, a responsible review of the product.</p>
<p>Not only did these folks review the product, they asked if they could<br />
promote it, which is a bonus that takes us into our next phase:</p>
<p>Step Four: Have leaders in our industry JV on the Launch Thursday, November<br />
17th at 9 am EST ( Ah&#8230; COMPLETE!)</p>
<p>Finally, there was a process that happens before the launch and that is the<br />
website.</p>
<p>That includes:</p>
<p>1.Sales page submitted for approval to ClickBank to have the affiliate<br />
program hosted by ClickBank (not a simple submission there!)</p>
<p>2. Get post approved on the Warrior Forum as a WSO (easypeasy)</p>
<p>3.JV Invite Page so affiliates could have promotional material, know what<br />
the product is about, what the commission rate is and when the launch day<br />
is. Here&#8217;s an example of a simple affiliate page (feel free to sign up:)<br />
<a href="http://thewestprogram.com/contentmultiplierwso/cmjv.html">http://thewestprogram.com/contentmultiplierwso/cmjv.html</a></p>
<p>4.Graphics for the pages (SumoPaint ROCKS!)</p>
<p>5.Download page for product, product download link, bonus download link and<br />
email autoresponder update form</p>
<p>6.Create and test an affiliate link, test the merchant process, test the<br />
product download, test customer followup emails, test ar followup messages</p>
<p>The next step is activating the ClickBank listing and then the wso.</p>
<p>Then we had to create a PHP redirect to make sure the CB links point to the<br />
WSO and not our main website (tricky and techy)</p>
<p>Finally, we go live and then post an FAQ in the form, a way for people to<br />
become affiliates and play the support game for the next week!</p>
<p>WHY oh WHY am I telling you all of this? Because doing business on the<br />
Internet takes work, communication, quality and detail.</p>
<p>Imagine if we would have started just picking away at this blindly!</p>
<p>There is great thought, detail and a lot of steps that go into an Internet<br />
business, especially in a product launch.</p>
<p>But&#8230; when you just do one step, then another, then another and<br />
communicate to others when you need help&#8230; it becomes simple.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to open the Forum inside the WEST program (I just have to<br />
create an instructional video) so that you can communicate with others<br />
while you are working on your business.</p>
<p>There is absolutely NO solicitations permitted in the forum, it&#8217;s a place<br />
to strategize, communicate and workout issues and solutions.</p>
<p>I do hope you found value in this email and that you are prepared to take<br />
on the responsibility of having a REAL business. Sometimes the guru guys,<br />
or even me and Mike make this stuff seem really easy.</p>
<p>Well, that just goes back to my old motto, &#8220;Simple Does NOT Equate to<br />
Easy:)&#8221;</p>
<p>Take care and we&#8217;ll be sending some really GREAT new WEST content real<br />
soon!</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
<p>Bob</p>

      <description>Each Internet marketer understands that the money is in &amp;#8220;the list&amp;#8221; having access to a targeted list of subscribers&amp;#8217; email is worth gold if it is used correctly. However, one of the hurdles that you come across when building an &amp;#8230; &lt;a class="more-link" href="http://thewestprogram.com/blog/646/think-about-these-things-when-renting-email-lists/"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class="meta-nav"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/the-west-program-blog/The_WEST_Program_Blog-Think_About_These_Things_When_Renting_Email_Lists.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each Internet marketer understands that the money is in &#8220;the list&#8221; having access to a targeted list of subscribers&#8217; email is worth gold if it is used correctly. However, one of the hurdles that you come across when building an email list is obviously time &#8211; you need to invest months and even years to build and nurture a mailing list before it starts giving you results. What should you do if you need a faster solution? You can rent a list! It&#8217;s the truth; the simplest solution for your list building issues is renting someone else&#8217;s list&#8211;a practice that has been going around for a super long time. Here are some of the things to keep in mind before you rent an email list for your own online business.</p>
<p>Newsflash: You will find a no hoopla reliable on the web income plan for business owners&nbsp;&nbsp; coming from all quantities of potential in addition to expenditure. Take a look at <a href="http://trustedhomebusinessguide.com/how-do-i-find-the-peoples-program-scott-miller-on-the-internet/" target="_blank">the peoples program scott miller</a> as well as other information to see.</p>
<p>When you want to rent out a specific mailing list you should do some homework and learn what you can about how the list was originally formed. In other words, understanding where your data comes from is important because otherwise you could be wasting your time and money on an unresponsive list. When you rent the mailing list make sure you ask the website about these things so that you won&#8217;t be faced with problems later after you&#8217;ve rented your list and started sending mail to it. Find out where the names originated and if they have been gotten through legitimate sources. You should also figure out if the list that you rent will like the kinds of things that you want to offer. This is something that should not be taken for granted. Sometimes even a relevant list may not be as targeted as you want it to be. This is because the target market just does not want what you are trying to sell them. In a way, this is the best type of preparation that you need. This is so that you will receive more conversions in the end. Overlooking these types of facts will cause you to lose focus. You will fail to get a lot of sales with this list.</p>
<p>Look at <a href="http://trustedhomebusinessguide.com/how-do-i-find-the-peoples-program-scott-miller-on-the-internet/" target="_blank">the peoples program scott miller</a> as well as other assets to gain the appropriate details to make your home business decision a legitimate and also prosperous enterprise.</p>
<p>Lastly, only go for a confirmed email list where the recipients have personally confirmed their email addresses. The email addresses are notorious for being worthless when they are on one time opt in lists. Ignore any list that is not confirmed, even if it&#8217;s big in size. Don&#8217;t ignore this tip if you plan on getting a ROI and you want your email recipients to take your email campaign seriously and respond to you. Doing this one thing can save you a lot of difficulty and result in your campaign succeeding.</p>
<p>Besides, you should think about this if you truly want you business to mature and become successful. You have to look at every aspect of it to retain profits and make it big. When you get an email list, you are also getting a good asset and you have to find out how that asset will serve you the most. When you have an online business, it is all about getting more and more assets and then turning around and using them to make the business better. Utilize them to your benefit. This is some very easy stuff to utilize in your internet business. But, if you really want to use them, then you will find the right list and use it to your advantage.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re looking for an sincere, honourable, along with genuine way to make money online, be sure to take a look at <a href="http://trustedhomebusinessguide.com/how-do-i-find-the-peoples-program-scott-miller-on-the-internet/" target="_blank">the peoples program scott miller</a> along with the some other recommendations and posts posted that may help you help to make a knowledgeable selection in order to find a web based business opportunity that&#8217;s best for your needs.</p>

      <description>Lately it has transpired to me that many of the websites You know I have managed content for do not possess one web page which seemed to be normal as a Industry Broad Web &amp;#8211; the FAQ or&amp;#60;sturdy&amp;#62;Frequently Inquired Questionsstrong&amp;#62;&amp;#160;page. &amp;#8230; &lt;a class="more-link" href="http://thewestprogram.com/blog/644/are-they-really-frequently-asked-questions/"&gt;Continue reading &lt;span class="meta-nav"&gt;&amp;#8594;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a type="audio/mpeg" href="http://podcasts.odiogo.com/get_mp3.mp3?f=/the-west-program-blog/The_WEST_Program_Blog-Are_they_really_Frequently_Asked_Questions.mp3"&gt;Click here to play&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately it has transpired to me that many of the websites You know I have managed content for do not possess one web page which seemed to be normal as a Industry Broad Web &ndash; the FAQ or&lt;sturdy&gt;Frequently Inquired Questionsstrong&gt;&nbsp;page.</p>
<p>But doing so may not be a bad thing as lengthy as the articles of the site offers the solutions the guests need. Ask on your own if you genuinely need which web page &ndash; or if the information which is parked there would be far better on more appropriate content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Typically Inquired Questions are not Inquiries You Wish These folks May Ask</h2>
<p>This is a typical mistake &ndash; adding a post well-rounded of details regarding the products and services, in a question-and-answer format, which isn&rsquo;t what your consumers want to comprehend when these folks click on to a &ldquo;Typical Inquiries&rdquo; or &ldquo;Generally Inquired Questions&rdquo; page. &nbsp;A real Typically Asked Questions post should assist your site by lowering the number of typical enquiries submitted to you by e-mail or on your purchaser program digital telephone variety &ndash; and could not replace possessing qualitycopywriting&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="search engine optimisation" href="http://www.wsi-ebizsolutions.biz/search-engine-optimisation_14.html">search engine optimisation</a>&nbsp;on your written content content.</p>
<p>If the customers&nbsp;&lt;robust&gt;actually&nbsp;hardy&gt;ask &ldquo;how do I buy doing so from your site? What fee techniques do you take? How considerably achieves delivery cost?&rdquo; the web page articles ought to be optimised to involve these details on relevant pages to make sure the customers do not have to go seeking for it&nbsp;<em>instead of&nbsp;</em>completing their purchase.</p>
<p>For example, if the site offers personalised car widgets, and the objective is to have potential consumers get in touch with you for a quote, the customized product content should answer the questions that you consider the potential clients could ask &ndash; or which they may possibly in fact ask &ndash; about the widget. The fewer presses they have to generate to discover that the A2019 widget these folks&rsquo;re interested in is produced of chrome-plated steel and takes up to 3 weeks to customise, the greater.</p>
<h2>Are you writing the correct inquiries?</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;re building a Typical Concerns post to reduce the quantity of simple query communications or calls, ensure you&rsquo;re inquiring and answering the questions in an accessible way the viewers should understand.

You should do a little bit of reading before  getting in touch with anyone to  learn regarding their terms and conditions.  It&#8217;s hard to calculate how much a web site costs simply because  this completely depends on how  complex and advanced you want the site to become. Yet, you  can decide on the quantity you afford  to pay, but without taking the  lowest price route either, because  other dangers hide within the &#8216;cheap&#8217;.</p>
<p> Determine what you want the site to look like, but only after  thorough market  research to discover what the target audience needs.

Then, the usage of  graphics is similarly essential because  you might&nbsp; want neither too much focus on graphics nor too little.  If you go through the portfolio and it seems that the majority of the site samples look alike, in that case, you need to go on together with your search. If  there is similarity of samples, then the web designers are  using web templates, replacing  graphics and colour to fit the  client.</p>
<p> You have to make certain  that the website does not look  like any other e-commerce web site on the web. An additional aspect to  pay attention to is the loading speed of the  sample websites. When the pages load quickly despite the  superior graphics, then, you&#8217;ve  found a few professional web designers you  can critically think about working with. The way in which various sample  websites look in  different web browsers also  matters a great deal. Even when there may be  variations, the website should not  break both. If there&#8217;s a mention of  &#8216;best seen in&#8217;, then it gets to be distinct  that the website continues to be  created to get a certain browser.</p>
<p> This is something which  might alienate potential guests,  which suggests the your web site  visitors is adversely impacted. Don&#8217;t  neglect such issues when  evaluating the solutions of numerous  web designers.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the majority of people get started trying to create money online, the first thing they do is look for affiliate products to promote. And there is not a thing wrong with this. Affiliate products may be your first stop but you can discover other money making strategies. You can start to take advantage of merchandise that will give you resale rights after you buy them. The good thing about using these types of merchandise is that once you get the product you have the right to sell this product to other men and women and keep 100% of the sales made. And I do mean all the money, it&#8217;s not necessary to share it with the designer of the product.</p>
<p>You can find resale rights products in just about any niche you want, you just need to know where to look for them. Needless to say you should always begin with the search engines when you are looking for these products. These products are all over the Internet and you will be able to discover them in the search engines by just entering something like &#8220;resale rights&#8221; in the search engines. You may also join resale rights membership sites which will offer you a specific amount of resale rights products each month. These membership sites can be great if you plan on marketing a number of products. And to be honest that is the best way to go, the more products you can sell the more money you will find yourself making down the road.</p>
<p>You will need to get a domain and hosting once you locate the products you will want to advertise. Also when you pick the hosting account make sure to get one that will permit you to add unlimited domain names to that account. By doing this you will be able to generate multiple sites and you won&#8217;t have to have a different hosting account for each product. However you will still want to get a separate domain for each and every product. Some of you might be thinking about just setting up a sub domain for each product, and you may do that. Even so obtaining a new domain name for each product is significantly better.</p>
<p>One more thing to you will have to make sure of if your buying these items one at a time is that they include the sales page for the website. Then all you have to do is to produce some changes to the sales copy, like your name and the cost of the product and upload it to your web host. A very important factor I forgot to mention is that you will also require a pay pal account to take payments and also to produce the buttons so people can pay you. Even though these things may seem confusing for some of you, if you complete a search on You Tube you will be able to learn how to do all those things.</p>
<p>After you make your first site and you have your payment button on the Internet site, all you have to do now is get individuals to visit your site. You can do this exactly the same way you used to market your affiliate products. But the best part is that when somebody purchases this product from you, you will get to keep all the cash and it will be paid directly to your Pay Pal account. As soon as you start making money with your first resale rights product, just rinse and repeat with various other resale rights products. You will soon realize that you will be able to produce more money when you have more websites. Every product is going to do what it can, and what this means is that some products will just never sell and other products will sell great. It is all &nbsp;an important part &nbsp;of &nbsp;the online business experience.</p>
<p>I will like to mention something in conclusion, a good friend of mine called Hiyolakose Ponbbelaihin got lots of benefits from the many tips in this article. You will too, if you take the time to really read through it and learn from it. You will be amazed how much you can learn from the guide in here that will make your life better.&nbsp;</p>
