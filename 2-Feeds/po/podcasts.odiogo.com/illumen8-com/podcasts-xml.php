      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>.<br />
Underneath the surface level of life there is a dimension that we all long to make contact with. This level of consciousness is not bound by the physical world and is much beyond all the boundaries and limitations of ‘reality’. It is this consciousness that we call the spiritual and although there are many views and definitions of what spirituality really is, the one thing we know it is, is that it’s that invisible part of life that affects our life in many deep and often mysterious ways.</p>
<p>What I would like to do here is to present 3 quotes on spirituality that I find deeply insightful. It comes from 3 very influential people; people who have made vastly different contributions to life and our understanding of what it means to be a human being in this world. It’s one thing to receive spiritual advice from a spiritual teacher, but to receive it from someone who actually lived it makes it so much more practical and believable.</p>
<p>The first quote is from Joseph Campbell, a man who spent a lifetime writing and thinking about the mysteries of life. Joseph Campbell is very well known in academic circles for his work on metaphysics and the significance of mystery in our lives. Here’s what he had to say:<br />
.<br />
.<br />
“All you can learn is what your own inward life is and try to stay loyal to that.”<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>In our ego driven world we all tend to look outside ourselves for approval and our peers tend to dictate much of our aspirations. We tend to compare ourselves to others to determine where we are in life and also where we ought to be going.</p>
<p>The great value of spirituality is that it calls on you to look deep within to find your own unique place and path in life. Realizing that you are unique in every way and that on a spiritual level you have a unique journey through life will open you up to a new way of living. When you look within you will discover that authentic spiritual part called your Self through which your entire life is lived. Joseph Campbell tells us to find this part of ourselves and then to stay true to that instead of always looking outside of ourselves for answers.</p>
<p>True fulfillment in life will never come from living up to someone else’s expectations or living your life the way you believe you ought to. It will never come from the attainment of goals or achieving success on someone else’s terms. The ultimate purpose of life is to find out what you are about on that deeper spiritual level and then to live it – it’s about translating your spiritual nature into you’re the life you are living.</p>
<p>So how do we do this?<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>There are many great insights, but one of the most powerful comes from a ‘little’ unassuming woman who changed the world through compassion. Here’s what she had to say:<br />
.</p>
<p>“We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence&#8230; We need silence to be able to touch souls.”<br />
.<br />
.<br />
The first quote on spirituality from Joseph Campbell was about finding your own authentic path in life. In this quote from Mother Theresa, she tells us how to do it. When mother Theresa offers spiritual advice I for one am willing to listen.</p>
<p>Mother Theresa shares with us a very profound spiritual lesson - embrace silence. God is the friend of silence and when you quiet your mind, you get to reconnect with God on a personal level. In our crazy-busy world, silence is often frowned upon. Dedicating time for silence and contemplation is probably the last thing on most people’s list of priorities, yet this is where true authentic power in life comes from. When you empty your mind from all the mundane demands and you return to the centre deep within, you are once again connected with that divine power that orchestrates the entire universe.</p>
<p>In a world dominated by new trends and technologies it seems like there is an even greater demand on our attention from every direction. We marvel at the latest inventions and the wonders of new technology, but still it’s all very temporary and only lasts until the next best thing comes along.<br />
.</p>
<p>Technology is an wonderful part of life and is as much a part of the wonder of creation as anything else. Even when you look beyond all the man-made wonders and venture into nature to observe a sunset, a shooting star or a thunderstorm, there is one thing that is universally mysterious about it all. Even with our technology advances and scientific knowledge, there is still a huge part of life that we simply do not understand and even something as fundamental as ‘where do we come from’ remains a mystery to us. Renowned scientist Albert Einstein spent a large part of his life trying to come up with answers to some of life’s most pressing questions. Here’s what he had to say about it:<br />
.</p>
<p>“The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.”</p>
<p>.<br />
.</p>
<p>Behind all the surface wonders of the world lies a deeper mystery – as if there is a divine hand behind it all that silently orchestrates and organizes it. This is the true wonder of life. At the heart of spirituality is this wonderful and mysterious force that is the essence of life.</p>
<p>Spirituality is about really waking up to life and to develop a higher awareness – an awareness of that mysterious force behind all of life. If you are not absolutely fascinated with life then you simply don’t know enough. It’s ironic that our modern day scientists are becoming more and more spiritual because the more we find out about the true nature of life, the more they are realizing that there is an indescribably force behind it all.<br />
.</p>
<p>These 3 quotes on spirituality are from 3 very different people, but their message is the same: beyond the mundane activities of life there is something bigger; a higher force that some call God. It is in your nature to know this Force. By discovering your own unique place in the world, by embracing silence and making contact with God you can awaken an awareness deep within yourself that will open your eyes to a whole new way of life. Life truly is a magnificent experience and learning to embrace this mysterious part of life that is also a part of you, you can start to embrace more of life and experience a richness that is much beyond anything else.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“We may turn to God when our foundations are shaking,<br />
only to discover it is God who is shaking them.” <br />
- Hebrew Proverb<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>Perception is everything. Everything that happens to you; everything from your past and everything in your future all relies on one simple thing and that is how do you choose to process that which happens to you? The way you choose to process everything that has or will happen to you makes up your entire experience of life. Although this ‘choice’ is mostly unconscious, it’s still a choice and something that you can take control of.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>The majority of people are oblivious to this powerful fact, mostly because the majority of our thoughts are shaped automatically by our past conditioning. Most reactions and interpretations are decided in split seconds by our unconscious awareness. Higher awareness on the other hand is a state of mind where you learn to transcend ordinary ‘autopilot’ awareness and where you become more conscious of the illusion of everyday occurrences. Living your life with a higher awareness will allow you to find a deeper sense of meaning in ALL of life and help you to discover your own unique life purpose.<br />
.</p>
<p>We tend to think that our life purpose only gets defined by our successes and our ‘glory moments’ BUT, even more so does our failures help to define our unique life path.<br />
.</p>
<p>The one thing that we all have in common is our pursuit of happiness. No one will consciously pursue anything that they believe will make them unhappy, yet there are so many people who are unhappy. Despite their best efforts, very few people get to truly create for themselves the kind of life that they ultimately desire. We tend to curse the ‘bad’ things in life and celebrate the good, but the transforming insight is that any life has many seasons. When you realize that you can start to welcome even the ‘mistakes’ and start to see it as an integral part of life. Regardless of how skilled or resilient you are, you will have ‘bad’ times.<br />
.</p>
<p>Although we all pursue happiness and the good in life, we need the flipside not only to provide the contrast, but also to help us define what we really want. A rich life; one that is truly fulfilled is not one that is only full of the good, but one that is filled with both. Learning to deal with and even celebrate the flipside of life is just as important as celebrating the joys of life. We tend to think that all the tragedies and setbacks in life can’t possibly be part of our life’s purpose, but in many ways these are the very things that help to define your life purpose and redirect you to your own unique path in life.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>In mid winter when everything is snowed under it’s quite hard to imagine a warm sunny day. The same is true when we meet with the ‘misfortunes’ of life – it tends to be really hard to find an empowering meaning while we are going through a tough time. Looking back at your life however, it becomes easier to find and to see a deeper meaning in what you went through. In hindsight we are able to ‘connect the dots’ and see that a divine hand has played it’s part all along. Your purpose in life is not just defined by the big ‘wins’ but also by the setbacks and learning to see this as it happens is a great step in your own personal and spiritual growth.<br />
.</p>
<p>Your entire life is about spirit unfolding through you and until and unless you listen to this spiritual aspect of yourself trying to reconnects with you, you will continue to feel like something is missing. All of your life is on purpose. But you have to be able to see it in order to use it as a means of sculpting your life and your experience of life.</p>
<p>By embracing it all you can start to hear that silent inner voice that’s constantly trying to reconnect you with your bliss. Maybe the setback is God trying to tell you to move on; to take a new direction to connect to your purpose. When you start seeing your purpose as something that is continuously unfolding in every moment of your life, your entire perspective of life changes.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Think of you higher purpose in life as a big puzzle and every aspect of your life is a piece of this puzzle. If you are only looking for the ‘pretty pieces’ you will never be able to complete the puzzle. Sometimes the seemingly insignificant pieces makes you see the bigger picture. All of it is part of the puzzle. Know that in every aspect of your life there is something greater happening behind the scenes. All you have to do is to be open to this and realize that God’s divine guidance is present in everything. When the foundations of your life are shaking, instead of cursing it, try and look beyond it and realize that there is Someone who is trying to give you an important message: get your life on purpose.<br />
.<br />
Living your life with a greater sense of spirituality will help you to seeing everything that you are going through as something that you have to go through. You can stop blaming and wallowing in setbacks, and start using everything that comes your way as a tool to help sculpt your soul. Developing a Higher Awareness through spirituality will help you to develop a greater awareness of what’s really going on.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>Ask for divine guidance and affirm to yourself that you intend to live your life on purpose. Intend for your life to be on purpose. Then, observe your life. Start to pay greater attention to everything you attract into your life – especially the seemingly insignificant things. Observe all the people that come in and out of your life. Observe everything that happens to you and start to look for that deeper meaning - this will lead and guide you to your life purpose and your own unique path in life.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Thought is the sculptor who can create the<br />
person you want to be.”<br />
- Henry David Thoreau<br />
.</p>
<p>The seemingly incompatible ideas of being both successful and spiritual are a very intriguing and powerful field that Dr. Wayne Dyer explores in his internationally bestselling book, The 10 Secrets for Success and Inner Peace. In the book Wayne Dyer explores a vastly new attitude towards life, success and spirituality. This attitude goes against the grain of much of what we’ve come to believe about living an extraordinary life and it calls on us to adopt a new way of perceiving ourselves and the world at large.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In a world that seems to be obsessed with having more and being the best, it’s hard for many people to comprehend success as a spiritual idea, yet in this book Wayne Dyer lays down a series of timeless principles that each and every one of us can follow and practice in our everyday lives to create for ourselves the kind of life that we ultimately desire.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This new spirituality is not one which you can keep neatly wrapped up until next Sunday morning. It is not a spirituality that is grounded in the traditional stigma of fear and dogma. Instead, it is a very practical and personal spirituality – one where God is personal and part of ALL of your life. The ultimate purpose of spirituality is for it to serve you and not frighten or judge you. The challenge is that we get born into a life and with this comes a set of belief that we cannot help but to adopt. This is the very thing that often keeps us from making the kind of progress that will free us.<br />
.</p>
<p>A very important aspect of your personal and spiritual growth is to be willing to be wrong and to have your belief system turned upside down. One of Wayne Dyer’s secrets for success and inner peace is to have a mind that is open to everything and attached to nothing. Having an open mind is a very hard thing for most of us to have simply because we’ve all been conditioned in so many different ways. Most of what we think is right or wrong is nothing but a function of the environment that we grew up in. When you close your mind, you close yourself off from what’s possible for you. When you open your mind to everything, you open the doors to the creative genius within you.</p>
<p>What you are capable of is a function of your mind and what you believe as being possible and not your physical capabilities or resources. Scientists have now proofed that until and unless you can see something happening in your mind, you won’t take the action necessary to make it happen. With an open mind, you are open to new suggestions and along with this you are able to see the entire world in a new way. Throughout history, all progress depended on people to have an open mind and people who were able to consider and conceive of the ‘impossible’ where those responsible for advancing humanity. A mind that is closed, especially to the obvious, is a mind that will only continue to move along the same line. Open minds can break their bounds and see things afresh.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>Your own inner genius relies on you to allow it to blossom and it starts by opening your mind. Creativity is a force that requires a fresh look at things and a mind that is open is a mind that allows the creative force of the universe to work through it. Even though most people claim to be open minded, very few are truly open to new points of view. Very few people are willing to be wrong or to have their own beliefs challenged.<br />
.</p>
<p>When it comes to matter spiritual people tend to tighten up. We’ve been so conditioned into slotting spiritual approaches into categories – especially when it comes to religion. People are incredibly sensitive when it comes to spiritual beliefs, and some will even defend it with their lives. George Bernard Shaw once said that “There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it.”<br />
.</p>
<p>What’s your view of it? <br />
.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>Sometimes we just can’t help but to ‘slot’ people and to be judgmental, BUT being open minded calls on us to let go of this and to really explore the possibilities. Life’s treasures are usually found in the most unlikely places!<br />
.</p>
<p>Living a more spiritually conscious life requires of you to be more open minded. The fact remains that we know very little about the true nature of the world we live in. There are just so many dimensions to life and so many unanswered questions that after 2000 years we are only starting to get a glimpse at the vastness of it all. How can anyone be an optimist in a world that is so rich in unexplored ideas and unanswered questions? How do we really know things are what they are? With an open mind you can start to embrace more of life and in the process you will start to develop a greater sense of awe for life. This is the foundation of having a rich life – rich in experience and in the totally of what you allow into your own private world.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>Spirituality is at the centre of our exploration into the world we live in and ultimately understanding more about ourselves is a thirst that we all have to quench. Spirituality has always been at the centre of humankind’s quest to know itself – to discover and explore life’s most profound quests. Life is not so much an ‘either or’ as it is an ‘as well as’ but our conditioning keeps us locked up in our own limiting beliefs. Open your mind and free yourself from the limitations that keep you locked up in your own limitations. An open mind will free that creative force that lies dormant within you. An open mind will help you to create a greater sense of harmony in your life and embrace more of life with a sense of wonder and awe. Free your mind and your spirit will follow.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>.<br />
“You cannot cross the sea merely by starring<br />
into the water.” – Tagore<br />
.</p>
<p>I am embarrassed to admit but there was a time in my life where my ultimate dream was to be rich enough so that I can have everything that I want without ever having to work. Although I have outgrown this shallow dream, a lot of people still entertain this dream in some shape or form. The ideal of freedom is as old as mankind, but in our modern (and seemingly more civilized) society where slavery is no longer a reality we are faced with a different set of challenges. So how do you go about creating for yourself that sense of freedom that you ultimately desire?<br />
.</p>
<p>For many the solution is easy and that is to find an easy solution. This rarely works. Passivity is a disease that so many people suffer from. Every healthy person aspires to be better in some way and everybody fosters a dream and a vision for their life, however faint it may be. Unfortunately the majority of people just sit back and wait for something to happen – for some ‘unexpected’ miracle or ‘savior’ to come along. Maybe this explains why hypnosis, visualization and the theories around manifesting is finding such an appeal these days.</p>
<p>In some respects finding the easiest way is built into us – as if we have a built in mechanism designed to help us. Much of the lure of today’s ‘success literature’ is aimed at promoting the ‘easy way’ and how you can get something for nothing. In many ways, the success of Rhonda Byrne’s The Secret flows from many people’s misinterpretation of the great law – thinking that they can use the law of attraction as a passive tool with which we can sit back and attract what they want.</p>
<p>The reason why passivity is so appealing for many is because for so long we’ve been taught that to be successful we have to work hard, struggle and sacrifice much. The pain associated to this is just too much for most of us and instead we look for easier ways to get what we really want in life. The law of attraction is very real and regardless of whether you believe in it, it still works in your life. The power of deliberately and consciously tapping into the law of attraction is not so much in what you attract through passivity, but what this powerful law invokes in your consciousness.<br />
.</p>
<p>When you start looking past the shallow interpretations of The Secret and using it as a means to ‘cheat the universe’ you will start to see the real value of The Secret. It’s a tool that you can use to find your own unique place in the world and to create for yourself the life that YOU were destined to live. The real Secret as it was taught in the ancient scriptures is about finding your bliss and following it through the path of action. This is not the kind of action that is forceful and in need of constant motivation. It’s effortless and joyous.</p>
<p>We all usually want more money or better relationships or greater health, but why? Underneath the surface of success lies a deeper spiritual need – a need to claim what’s your which is all of the abundance that you were born into and to  realize who you really are. Being abundant, healthy and loving is inherently part of your nature.<br />
.</p>
<p>Using the law of attraction to passively attract more stuff into your life might work for some, but in the end this will only help you to suffer in comfort. Using the secret to find your bliss and attract into your life your deepest innermost desires to help your to realize your true self – that is the real power of using this eternal law of the universe.<br />
.</p>
<p>If you have to constantly force yourself to do things in order to be successful you will probably get there if you are very diligent and have great determination. But, real success on a deep spiritual level, is really the path of lest resistance. It’s not about having it all, but rather feeling that you deserve it and that it’s actually worth it. As long as your happiness and sense of fulfillment in life relies on stuff you will never be happy because having more is a function of your ego and by nature the ego can never have enough. You will find yourself always striving for more and never having a sense of inner peace.<br />
.</p>
<p>What you think about will expand in your life. What you really need to expand is not more stuff, but rather your bliss – on a spiritual level you want your highest calling and your deeper self to realize itself. What The Secret really calls on you to do is to find deep within yourself that which you really want; to find your bliss and then focus all your attention on that – not for the sake of having more, but rather as a means of realizing your Self.</p>
<p>Don’t sacrifice your dreams for the sake of having more. Don’t use the law of attraction as a means to sidestep life and the process of creating your life. Passivity is usually the path chosen by those who are pursuing something that’s not in accord with them. The ancestor to every action is a thought and this is where the real power of The Secret lies – to dictate and to orchestrate the creation of your life; not through passivity, but through action. Ultimately your bliss and your path in life is the one of least resistance and using the power of thought and action you can walk this path in joy and without striving.<br />
.</p>
<p>You can never fool the universe. Everything that you do with an egotistical ideal will come tainted with doubt and it is this doubt that will prevent you from attracting that which you desire. The law of attraction is a very real and powerful force and is not some ‘new’ discovery but an ancient spiritual secret. If you use it as a tool for self realization and enriching life for yourself and everybody else, your intentions will be pure and you will be free from doubt.<br />

“The true value of a human being can be found in the<br />
degree to which he has attained liberation from the self.”<br />
- Albert Einstein<br />
.</p>
<p>The mind – body – spirit analogy is probably the most widely accepted model for representing our understanding of humankind and what constitutes our being. These three distinct parts of the Self seems to encapsulate our entire experience of ourselves and our lives. For decades now most of the analysis about human consciousness revolved around some version of the body – mind  - spirit model. But there is another way of analysing the self (one of many) that is equally valid and in many ways more useful as a way of understanding more about our spirituality and how we can live a more conscious life.</p>
<p>Looking things in a new way can be mind opening. We tend to get so stuck in accepted ways of looking at things that we rarely stretch ourselves to new level of understanding that often comes from looking at something from a new perspective. With this in mind, let’s take a look at spirituality from a different angle – from an angle that will help you in your everyday life and in consciously growing in both your understanding and in your evolution of your spirit.<br />
.</p>
<p>Each and every one of us have two distinct aspects about ourselves. These two aspects are our constant companions on life’s journey and no matter how hard we try, we cannot escape them. Together they make up your consciousness and your very experience of your Self and your life. The first aspect represents our appearance and the face we wear in this world. It’s called the ego and it that part of you that represents you to others and to the world at large. The ego is like a mask you wear, a mask that is necessary for your spirit to be able to ‘live’ in this life. The second aspect of You, is your spirit or your higher self. It is that part of you that’s invisible and that quietly lives in that inner space deep inside your consciousness.<br />
.</p>
<p>Try and think of these two aspects of your Self not as two people living inside you, but rather as two sides of the same you. Like two faces of the same coin they are inextricably connected to each other. Both are part of the life force, the one primarily concerned with where you are while the other is primarily concerned with where you came from and where you are ultimately going back to.</p>
<p>Although ego and spirit are so closely related, they have vastly different demands on both your conscious and your unconscious attention. Your ego is primarily concerned with maintaining it’s importance in the world. It always wants to be right and is convinced of the fact that it is separate from everyone else. It’s always in competition – always wanting to be better than everyone else. Ego always strives to have more, to be better and to dominate. The ego’s value is determined by comparing itself to others to see how it stacks up – the ego’s point of reference is always outside of itself.<br />
.</p>
<p>The world is filled with ego driven people. One of the key characteristics of more spiritual people is their ability to focus more on their spiritual aspect. In many ways the needs of spirit is almost the exact opposite and is not interested in any of the demands that dominate the ego. Spirit’s primary need is to be at peace and being right and conquering others is of no concern to spirit. Spirit has no need for more because it knows that it’s value comes from itself and not from what it gains, what it wins or what it collects and accumulates.</p>
<p>Much of our own inner conflicts arise from a conflict between these two aspects of ourselves. It presents us with two vastly different and conflicting sets of demands. Living a more spiritual life with a greater sense of inner peace and personal fulfilment is primarily about placing greater emphasis on the higher self and on giving the spirit a greater prominence in your life. It’s not a process of slaying the ‘evil’ ego, but rather about learning to subdue the ego and it’s demands in favour of the higher self’s demand to be at peace.<br />
.</p>
<p>The real question is who you are allowing to run things in your life. Is it ego or is it spirit? If your life is driven by having more, being better than, being right and dominating; then ego is in charge. If your life is driven by having a sense of inner peace, by being compassionate, reaching out to others and giving - then you allow spirit to take over. Living from your higher self is about living in harmony with the flow of goodness of the universe and you will rarely encounter any conflicts. Ego on the other hand thrives on conflict – it’s a chance to proof it’s importance and dominance over other people and circumstances.<br />
.</p>
<p>Renowned scientist Albert Einstein’s opening quote reflects beautifully what we are talking abut here. What he meant with his statement is that we will discover a higher value in being human when we learn to free ourselves from the demands and expectation of the ego. The ‘self’ that he is referring to is the ego. The question is who is running your life? Is it ego or is it spirit? Learning to break through the facade that your ego upholds you can live a more peaceful, joyous and fulfilled life.<br />

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>.<br />
What is it that’s at the centre of your life?<br />
.<br />
What is it that makes up the main focus of your daily pursuits?<br />
.<br />
For many, this creates a great divide in their lives and as many of our conscious pursuits are only designed to satisfy our subconscious desires. Nowhere is this more evident in the pursuit of happiness. Ironically the majority of people fail to recognize one very important aspect and that is the fact that happiness is a relative concept. Your own happiness and sense of fulfillment is deeply rooted in your spirit and is unique and special to you alone.</p>
<p>The common belief in our culture is that there are happy things to do and that there are unhappy things to do and most of us buy into it – just waiting for the next big happy thing to come along. More than anything this tendency quite literally takes your own well being out of your own hands. (maybe that explains why so many people are ‘victims’ these days)</p>
<p>Living your life on purpose and feeling like you are living the kind of life that you were destined to live is a fundamental part of your own inner happiness. Finding your true calling in life and to express it in all of who you are, is the foundation of living a truly fulfilled life.<br />
.</p>
<p>In many ways this is the reason why we are all here – to express and experience the highest and most sacred part of ourselves. Discovering your life purpose is ‘deep water’ and only through introspection and maintaining a sense of spirituality about your life can you truly make contact with this aspect of your Self and re-align your Self.</p>
<p>History has left us with many ordinary people who became extraordinary simply because they chose to ‘be’ themselves. These are examples of people who managed to realize their potential by living their lives on purpose and expressing who they really are. These are the people that left behind a legacy and managed to advance humanity by simply being themselves.</p>
<p>.<br />
So many people feel that in order to be special or significant they have to be like someone else (who might be successful). They key things to remember is that to live your life on purpose does not require you to become something that you are not. It’s simply about looking deep within – looking at your inner most desires, your talents, your passions and then finding ways to express this in service of humanity. Now this does not mean that you don’t have to change. For many it means you have to change every aspect of what your life is demonstrating at the moment.<br />
.</p>
<p>With this in mind, here are three lessons in living your life on purpose from three great people who managed to somehow do it – people who discovered and lived their life on purpose. Needless to say, they were all people who left behind a legacy and still inspire us long after they have left.<br />
 </p>
<p>Lesson Number 1:-<br />
.<br />
“Your profession is not what brings home your paycheck. Your profession is what you were put on earth to do. With sufficient passion and such intensity that it becomes spiritual in calling.”<br />
– VINCENT VAN GOGH<br />
.<br />
So many people go to work everyday only to make a living. Their lives are driven by a paycheck and even though they hate it, they still do it. It’s true that we all have to make our way in the world, BUT you deserve to make a living doing what you love. If you have a full time job, then you will spend approximately 70 percent of your waking life at work.</p>
<p>Regardless what your passion in life may be, you can make a living doing it. There is never a lack of support for your passion, but there is almost always a lack of resolve to take the risk and to step up to the ultimate challenge in life: to live on purpose and to become the kind of person you were destined to be.<br />
 <br />
.<br />
Lesson Number 2:-<br />
.<br />
“Where your talents and the needs of the world cross lies your calling.”<br />
– ARISTOTLE<br />
.</p>
<p>Every last one of your talents came as part of the package called You. Everything that you are good at and everything that you are bad at are part of your purpose. We all have at least one thing that we are great at – something that’s just effortless to you? By design, these talents speak to us when we express them and often we feel joy when we express them.</p>
<p>When you take these talents and express them to serve humanity, you open yourself up to the abundance of the universe. Expressing your talents for the sole purpose of sharing yourself and your gifts, you are in harmony with the highest power in the universe and (ironically) you will find that this is when the blessings of life start showering down on you.</p>
<p>Don’t hoard your talents. Don’t deny your talents in favor of what you think you ought to be good at in order to be successful or famous. Express who you are and do it only to help, to serve and to give the gift of You to the world.<br />
 <br />
.<br />
Lesson Number3:-<br />
.<br />
“I never did a day’s work in my life. It was all fun.” <br />
- THOMAS A. EDISON<br />
.</p>
<p>Working only to make a living is nothing but slavery. Your purpose will free you. As long as you are doing something that you do not love, you will never get to experience the true meaning of life and the sense of joy that comes from doing what you love.</p>
<p>Life was meant to be a joyful expression of who you really are. When you are on purpose there is no such thing as ‘work’ and you are able to move beyond the usual categories of life where you have to place different parts of your life in different categories.<br />
.<br />
We all have a life purpose. Think of it not as an ‘occupation’ but rather as an underlying idea that guides your entire life. Think of your life purpose as a guiding light that leads and guides every part of your life. We are all here for a reason. This is unique and different for every, yet it is something that remains illusive for many. Discovering your life purpose is a spiritual process and when you look inside you can start to find a deeper and more meaning aspect of yourself and your life. The reward: a deeply fulfilled life!</p>

<p>“People are born for different tasks, but in<br />
order to survive every one requires the same<br />
nourishment; inner peace.”<br />
– SAI BABA<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>What exactly is inner peace?<br />
.<br />
What does it mean to be at peace?<br />
People go around using the word peace very loosely and in our current world circumstances for many the word peace simply means to be free from war and conflict. However, peace has a much more profound and much more significant meaning than mere freedom from war. As Sai Baba pointed out to us – inner peace is the very thing that nourishes our spirit.</p>
<p>Although it’s quite hard to define what inner peace really is, we all know what it feels like because we’ve all had times in our life when we experienced it. For many inner peace shows up in their lives as fleeting moments of bliss and more often than not it is something that they cannot really hold on to. One of the greatest blessings that comes from living a more spiritually conscious life is to cultivate a greater sense of inner peace.</p>
<p>Any form of conflict that you experience removes you from that sense of inner peace. Inner peace is a deep inner sense of ease – a sense of inner comfort and stillness that is both joyful and calming. Inner peace will free you from many of the demands and expectations that drive most people over the edge. By living your life with a greater sense of self awareness you can start to cultivate a sense of inner peace and live life with a greater sense of clarity and perspective. A life of turmoil is characterized by immediate demands and shortsighted gains and like a wildfire you can never quite get the best of it.</p>
<p>Living your life with a sense of inner peace is not so much a conscious pursuit as it is the result of living your life in a certain way. It’s not so much in what you do as it is what you don’t do. Your nature – your own spiritual essence (your soul) comes from a place of peace and it’s ultimate pursuit is to be at peace. The challenge that we are all faced with is that our everyday lives tend to distract us from a sense of inner peace.</p>
<p>Lets briefly look at 3 of the biggest barriers that cause most people to disconnect themselves from this sense of inner peace.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1. The Ego</p>
<p>.<br />
Your ego is that part of you that’s like a veil to your spirit. It’s the external façade that we all wear in order to operate in this world. Your ego constantly reminds you about your separateness and how you have to proof yourself by being better than, faster than or stronger than everybody else. Your ego is the source of most of the conflicts in your life. These can be conflicts with other people and even with yourself because the ego is fixated on being the most important person. Much of the anger, resentment and frustration in your life come from the ego’s demands on you</p>
<p>Having a sense of inner peace allows you to be in harmony with everyone and everything. The effect of inner peace is a sense of unity and you start to see both your environment and your fellow human beings as being connected to you in some invisible way.</p>
<p>Although you cannot rid yourself of your ego, you can go along way in subduing the ego’s demands on you and focusing on living from your higher self instead – making a conscious effort not fall prey to your ego and all the millions of demands it places on you every day.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
2. Living In The Future</p>
<p>.<br />
It’s important to realize that wherever your mind is – there you are. If your attention is in the past or the future, then that is what your experience of life will be. So many people waste away their precious time living their lives in a time other than now. Wallowing in the past serves no purpose and no matter what you do you cannot change that which is over. Worrying about what might happen in the future will only cause you to feel an inner sense of turmoil. Worry tends to consume your entire mind, removing you from feeling at peace.</p>
<p>One of the key spiritual realizations is to understand that the only ‘time’ you really have is now. Where your thoughts are now is where you are. If you think that one day when you have enough money or when the right person comes along or when you are fit and healthy THEN you will be happy – think again! Divert your thoughts and your energy to the present moment instead and give up everything that’s over and done with and let go of everything that might be.<br />
.<br />
.</p>
<p>3. Spiritual Ignorance</p>
<p>.<br />
There is an aspect to each and everyone of us that is invisible, yet very real. This higher self, your spirit is who you really are. You will continue to feel unfulfilled in life until you recognize and nurture the seeds of divinity deep within you.</p>
<p>It is this spiritual part of you that seeks to be at peace. When you recognize and nurture your own divinity you can start to listen more to your Self and less to the demands and expectations of the world. Knowing what brings you a sense of inner peace is the essence of living a more peaceful life.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
By becoming more aware of these three ‘enemies’ of inner peace you can start to make a more conscious effort to stay connected with your own spirituality and live a more blissful life. An inner sense of quiet and tranquility is a very important part of being happy in your Self. Make it your goal in life not to achieve or have more, but instead to be at peace and reorganize your priorities to create an environment within yourself where your spirit can thrive.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Without inner peace no person can survive. Almost daily we see headlines of super ‘successful’ people having to turn to drugs or alcohol just to cope with the inner turmoil they are experiencing. It’s a challenge that we are all faced with and with every experience of life you have the choice: Do you choose peace or do you choose turmoil? Do you choose to win, to be better, to have more, to proof someone else wrong…OR &#8230;do you choose that which will bring you inner peace?</p>

a few scattered pleasures, but what will render his life<br />
happy on the whole amount.”  – JOSEPH ADDISON</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>We are all in pursuit of happiness. In some shape or form we are constantly moving towards what we believe will make us happy, either in the short or in the long term. You might say that we are designed for happiness and since the beginning of time human beings devised countless ways and means of creating happiness. For the majority of us, happiness comes in the form of what we call success; by achieving certain ‘things’ that we believe will make us happy.</p>
<p>We live in a culture where the trappings of success is running rampant. Ironically we can see the so-called icons of our time, who appears to have everything, dealing with immense inner struggles. We tend to pursue the symbols of success whereas what we really crave for is that inner feeling of being a successful human being. Aristotle noted that true success lies not in possessing things, but in the knowing that you deserve it. This knowing is a deep inner conviction that is the cornerstone of living a truly happy and fulfilled life.</p>
<p>When you are fulfilled your life is one of the deepest joy because you feel like your life is fully worth living and that you are fulfilling a greater purpose. You feel that you are realizing the reason why you came here.</p>
<p>With the pursuit of the symbols of success we tend to get trapped by the belief that we will be happy in some future time ‘when’ I have the perfect job or the money, or the relationship or the health. To be truly happy we need to detach ourselves from events and circumstances and learn to live our lives on purpose – and to find happiness within. This can be easier said than done, especially when you are trapped in a relationship you hate, or a job you hate or with a body you hate.</p>
<p>We can look at this in 4 categories of experience and many of us move in and out of them throughout our lifetime. An awareness of these categories can help us to come to the realization that we are never stuck and that there’s always another way.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The first category is when you Do What You Hate:</p>
<p>.<br />
On a deep level we all know what we love and what we hate. Yet, so many people are stuck in careers that they hate or stay in relationships with people they will never be in harmony with. In this category, you know that you hate it, but still you do it and often you have ‘good reasons’ to do so. The truth is that as long as you are in this category you will never be happy because you know that what you are doing is something you hate.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The second category is to Hate What You Do:</p>
<p>.<br />
You might be doing something you quite like, but somehow that are things you don’t like about it and consequently you hate doing it. The problem is not with what you are doing, but in the actual doing. You might be in a relationship with someone you love, but still you hate it. You might be doing something you love(ed) but you hate doing it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The third category is to Love What You Do:</p>
<p>.<br />
We’ve all met people in some of the worse jobs ever who seem to always be happy. These are people who have learned a secret of life which is to love what you do, regardless of what you are doing.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The fourth category is to Do What You Love:</p>
<p>.<br />
Although we all know what we hate, somehow it seems much harder to find what we love to do. Doing what you love is probably the greatest gift you can give to yourself and one that will reward you with life’s deepest joy which is true fulfillment.</p>
<p>We all find ourselves in one or more of these categories in different areas of our lives and we are constantly moving in and our of these categories as our experience of life shifts. It’s very useful to analyze your life according to these four categories as it can help you to get on the life path called fulfillment. True fulfillment can only come from a life path where you love what you do, and do what you love. Until and unless you reach this point you will never live life at the highest level.</p>

<p>Here Are The 5 Timeless Principles Of Living A Fulfilled Life:</p>
<p>1. - Realize that you are unique and special and that you have a higher purpose in life:</p>
<p>You are not an accident. You are here for a reason and part of your mission is to find out why you are here. There is more to life than what meets the eye and deep down inside we all know this.</p>
<p>2. - Find your bliss :</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Find what you love in life and do it. Do it as often as possible and be kind to yourself by doing that which brings you a sense of inner joy. Be kind to yourself and follow your hearts desires. Ultimately there is nothing noble in sacrificing your innermost desires for the sake of ‘doing the right thing’. The right things are the things that come from your soul.</p>
<p>3. - Love what you do:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Doing what you love is only one half of the story. You still have to love what you do and this is an attitude and something that you have to actively DO in your life. Even if you are doing something you hate, you can still love doing it and once you do this you start to shift the focus of your life and more of what you do love will start showing up.</p>
<p>4. - Keep growing and expanding:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Without continual growth and the expansion of yourself you will soon get bored and start ‘hating what you do’. Personal growth is an essential ingredient in being fulfilled. Growing compels you to expand in your awareness and in your understanding and realization of yourself. Like every living thing, if you don’t grow you will die, even if it’s only an emotional death.</p>
<p>5. - Be inner directive:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Don’t allow others to prescribe your happiness for you. Listen to that still small voice within that only you can hear. Ultimately you are the only one that can make yourself happy. So many people can’t hear that still small voice inside because they are always listening to all the voices around them directing them.</p>
