<h1>Hiding Behind My Hair</h1>
<p>Do you do this?</p>
<p>I need to knock on wood before I go any further or the universe will make my hair all fall out for bragging about it! Ha!</p>
<p>Do you have a normal sized bathroom mirror?  Do you avoid the big full length mirror in the hallway?  Or do you just stand there in the perfect position so that you&#8217;ve fooled yourself into thinking you haven&#8217;t gained really all that much weight?</p>
<p>Ok&#8230;back to the hair.</p>
<p>Put the face on, get the hair done!  Gorgeous!    &#8230;..right?</p>
<p>Except for the mess under the face and hair.  But that mirror in the bathroom only shows what you have absolute control over (and really only what I&#8217;m willing to deal with).  That&#8217;s all that really matters right?</p>
<p>Umhm&#8230;I wish it was that easy.</p>
<p>But Ive been hiding behind my hair for much too long.  Will I cut it all off.  NO!  Will I look beyond the bathroom mirror to keep everything in order?  YES!</p>
<p>.</p>

      <description>Out of what?
The mess I got myself into over the summer.
I was very good at practicing my addictions!  Food &amp;#38; wine!
Im digging and clawing my way back out into the world of normalcy.  Normal for who?  Certainly hasn&amp;#8217;t been my normal, but I&amp;#8217;m working on it being that way.

<p>I have struggled with my weight and sugar cravings for as long as I can remember.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-303" title="mother-and-daughter" src="http://www.foodandsugaraddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/mother-and-daughter-232x300.png" alt="mother-and-daughter" width="232" height="300" /></p>
<p>I remember that mashed potatoes were and still are my ultimate comfort food.  2nd place being home made macaroni and cheese.</p>
<p>I remember that chicken was a major staple at the dinner table when I was a kid.</p>
<p>I remember that dessert was only a Sunday night thing.</p>
<p>I remember that crazy feeling in my head when I was a kid and looked for what ever sweet I could get my hands on.</p>
<p>I remember my father telling me when he was a kid, living thru the depression and having 10 siblings all living in the same house that desserts were scarce.  He used to make sugar sandwiches.  This was my first &#8220;ah ha&#8221; moment.  This was how I could get the sugar I was craving!  I started making bread/butter/sugar sandwiches to get my &#8220;fix&#8221;.  Then one of my friends from school said, &#8220;You need to toast it, melt the butter and put brown sugar and cinnamon on it! It&#8217;s delicious like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was stuff that was in the house and was readily available.  Today things are a bit different for our own kids.  Sugar is everywhere.  Getting a sugar fix is realitively easy.</p>
<p>My daughter is 12.  Starting that puberty stuff.  This is when <strong>my</strong> sugar issues first exploded.  I do <strong>NOT</strong> want my daughter to have to go thru a life time of crazy sugar feelings.</p>
<p>I have been noticing some wild fluctuations in her moods the last little while.  At first I thought it was just hormones.  I let it go for quite a while.  Then I started to have her journal her food and feelings.  What a <strong>&#8220;WOW&#8221;</strong> moment for this mom!</p>
<p>We sat down and had a heart to heart talk about how she was feeling and if she liked it.  The answer as you can guess was &#8220;no&#8221;.   I also asked her if she wanted help with controlling all that crazy feeling that was going on in her head.  She had a bit of a cry and admitted that she really wanted help with it.</p>
<p>I wanted her to feel like this was a sugar issue and not a weight issue.  But the weight issue came up after a shopping trip for new summer clothing.  She says it fits, I say its too small.  I dont like seeing anything tight around her belly.  She doesnt either, but then the top is too big.  There was a little melt down about the fact that she needs to buy xl t-shirts to fit her belly and its still too big ontop.  Ok&#8230;mom to the rescue again.</p>
<p>This was and still is so hard!  I don&#8217;t want her to focus on her weight.  I&#8217;ve told her that if she doesn&#8217;t gain any weight over the summer, by August alot of her belly will be gone.  In her mind, both the crazy feelings and the little bit of belly are major issues and she wants it all to be gone.  Ok, I get that.  Thankfully the food program I have put together for her is keeping her moods much more stable.  She isnt liking that she can&#8217;t have all the sugar filled goodies all day long like she used to.  But she isn&#8217;t deprived either.  We&#8217;ve brought back dessert.  Whether its a sugar free popsicle or a home made apple crisp.  It&#8217;s still there, and she is able to see that she still gets to have a sweet once a day.  She just has to have it after a meal.  Period.</p>
<p>Last night created a bit of a meltdown because she doesn&#8217;t like being denied.  But this morning she got up and got on the scale and told me with a bit of question in her voice what she weighed.  Turns out my little girl has lost 1/2 a pound.</p>
<p>I am so proud of her!  But it is a fine line we walk isn&#8217;t it.  Give her the tools and encouragement to do it on her own.  Let her fly, pick her up when she falls, hold her hand when she needs guidance. Always tell her she is beautiful and will always be my baby girl.</p>
<p>I would love for the sugar crazies to stop here!  Have the right tools to take it under control and leave it there.</p>
<p>One step at a time.</p>

<p>Aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I happened to be complaining about this today, when hubs says to me, &#8220;Hey, that sounds like a blog post!  Get typing!&#8221;</p>
<p>So here I am&#8230;.typing about how sick and tired I am of eating the same foods, day in and day out.  When you go off plan, there seems to be so much more variety.  Right?  Sure, but it&#8217;s all stuff we shouldn&#8217;t be eating in the first place.</p>
<p>Here is what gets me, I have a great imagination.  I am very creative.  But at the end of the day, the very last thing I want to do is cook!  For the most part I like cooking.  But only when I don&#8217;t have to.  Getting creative with my food isn&#8217;t usually something I want to be bothered with at 5:30 when I&#8217;m hungry and everyone around me is hungry.</p>
<p>I swear if I eat any more chicken I&#8217;m going to sprout feathers and start clucking!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m totally burned out on broccoli!  I like it, but I just don&#8217;t want it anymore.  I&#8217;ve actually started eating asparagus, which is extremely rare for me.  Its good, but up until about a year ago I didn&#8217;t really know how to cook it.  I&#8217;m learning.</p>
<p>I also know that planning my food, and eating on a schedule and eating what I have planned is key to my success.  But life gets in my way.  As well as my own self&#8230;getting out of my own way is also an issue.</p>
<p>Ok&#8230;so we all agree I have issues! lol</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before and I&#8217;ll say it again&#8230;.I need a wife!  Or maybe a chef training intern, who can come to my house and cook for us.  Oh, how cool would that be!?!?!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Some thoughts&#8230;.</p>
<ul>
<li>should a food addict be thinking about food all the time?</li>
<li>should a sugar addict be scouring recipe books?</li>
<li>should a food addict be searching thru food magazines looking for new foods to eat?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am tired of planning food, I am tired of cooking food, but I never tire of eating food.</p>
<p>It is always a wonderful day when hubs says, lets eat out, or he just takes over the cooking.  Because he doesn&#8217;t particularly like to cook, and I&#8217;m so tired of it and all the same foods, we have been eating out alot more.  Not such a good plan.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a work in progress!</p>
<p>If anyone has any great suggestions for food prep, please leave a comment on how you do it!  I&#8217;d love to hear from you!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met this very lovely lady on Twitter!  She is way over on the other side of the world, but she &#8220;knows&#8221; what I am going thru.</p>
<p>She offered to share her story with me quite a while ago.  Emailed it to me, and when I asked if I could share it with the world she very graciously agreed to let me.</p>
<p>You may know her as Selena or on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/Spreiki">@Spreiki<br />
</a></p>
<p>Here is her story&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>This is my story.</p>
<p>One of my earliest memories was sneaking into the kitchen when my mum<br />
wasn’t looking and making myself a white bread and margarine sandwich -<br />
I’m talking from before I was 10 years old.  And I‘d do this a lot.  When<br />
I wasn&#8217;t doing that, I was eating lashings of chocolate whenever I could.</p>
<p>When I was at Junior school my mum told the cook to just give me a piece<br />
of fruit for my pudding as I wasn’t just having seconds, I was having<br />
thirds of pudding every single day.  Boy was I mad at her!</p>
<p>When I left school I fell into a job, I had no motivation, I was depressed<br />
and I would literally binge all day long.  If it wasn‘t nailed down, I<br />
would eat it.  I would eat sugared cereal straight out of the pack while<br />
sitting on the floor and biscuits all day long.  I could not stop.</p>
<p>My confidence was through the floor despite being smart.  I was<br />
rebellious, withdrawn, oh you name it, I had it.  I didn’t know who I was<br />
or what I wanted from life and thought that losing weight was the answer<br />
to all the worldly ills - oh how wrong could I have been LOL - I was just<br />
sugar sensitive!  I lost a lot of weight with Weight Watchers and then<br />
regained 8.5 pounds in two weeks after rediscovering chocolate.  The<br />
following week I lost all of that weight plus another half a pound.  I<br />
couldn’t see how crazy it was.</p>
<p>I discovered the book Potatoes not Prozac as soon as it came out - by then<br />
I had pretty much every diet book going!  I read it and connected with it<br />
straight away but I wanted a quick fix.  I didn’t want to wait - I wanted<br />
it all NOW.  It sat back on my shelf for another five years and I had to<br />
explore plenty more avenues before I would come back to it again.</p>
<p>When I wasn’t eating sugar and whites I was drinking.  I lost whole<br />
weekends.  On another detour I lost 80 pounds before I threw my hands in<br />
the air and decided, enough was enough.  It took me another two years of<br />
faffing around with the program before I got past step 2 (there are 7<br />
steps on the program).</p>
<p>Around step 3 I was starting to feel good.  I had never travelled on my<br />
own before but I wanted to go to the Radiant Recovery Brits meeting in<br />
London (100 miles away) but couldn’t figure out how I could possibly do<br />
it.  I was petrified!  I posted about it on the website and I was given<br />
some baby steps and websites that I might look at for trains etc.  I went<br />
and had a fabulous time!</p>
<p>My program progressed quite swiftly after that initial meeting and I<br />
detoxed totally by accident in June - the sugar had been missing for 3<br />
days before I had even realised.  I was planning on detoxing after the<br />
summer holidays so that I could still have ice creams with my children but<br />
my body had other ideas!  Talk about a non-event.</p>
<p>Since then I&#8217;ve flown to Amsterdam on my own to meet up with a couple of<br />
radiant pals and we flew on to Boston together for a seminar in Maine.<br />
Just a year ago I would never have entertained the idea - not in a million<br />
years - but now it just seems a totally natural thing to do - no fuss,<br />
just functional.</p>
<p>I am now happy the vast majority of the time, I eat just three meals a<br />
day, I can&#8217;t remember the last time I binges, I am filled with joy - I<br />
know what full feels like, I wear make-up again to please myself (not<br />
others!), and I am moving my body more and meditating.  If something’s not<br />
right, I know how to fix it or know where to find the advice to do so.  I<br />
am starting to dream again, to do the things that are important to me, to<br />
be who *I* am, not someone who the media says I ought to be.</p>
<p>I used to inhale whole doughnuts.  But now when I look in cake shops, they<br />
do not call to me any more.  It is an amazing feeling!</p>
<p>Well, that’s me .  I&#8217;m not too sure why I felt the need to tell you<br />
my story, but I hope that something in my email has helped.</p>
<p>All the very best,</p>
<p>Selena</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the comments Selena made inparticular that made me sit up and take notice was&#8230;</p>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote><p>When I wasn’t eating sugar and whites I was drinking.</p></blockquote>
<p>.<br />
I truly believe there is a connection between sugar addiction and alcohol addiction.   Out of all the addictions in my very large family, I got the sugar/food addiction.  Alcohol for the most part (except in my younger years) only goes so far.   Only because I don&#8217;t like not being able to function the next day.  But you see&#8230;.I can binge on cakes, cookies, chocolate, candy until my belly feels like it is going to explode and I can still function.   No hangover or wicked headache.</p>
<p>Maybe they need to come up with a pill for sugar addicts like the Topamax pill for alcoholics?  Yes I know there isn&#8217;t a magic pill, but I will always look for one!</p>
<p>I hope you were able to gain some insight into your own issues from this post.  I also hope you can see that you are not alone in your struggle.  There are many of us out there fighting the same fight.</p>
<p>If you would like your story, with us please send it to me,  robin at foodandsugaraddiction .com.  Everyone who is fighting against food and sugar has a story.  You may be at goal weight, or working on getting there.  Where ever you are in your journey, I would love to hear from you.</p>

<h1>It Hasn&#8217;t Been Easy</h1>
<p>.</p>
<p>But nobody said it would be did they?</p>
<p>I have been mia from posting here for a month.  A bit too long!  To add to my irritation, I just heard a friend has lost 40lbs in 2 weeks!  Yes you read that right&#8230;.but she also had lap band surgery 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>It just kind of put a downer on me.</p>
<p>Where would I be today if I had kept at it.  I&#8217;d be 4 more weeks into this, and down a few more pounds.  Most definitely not 40, but a few.</p>
<p>Alright, well enough about that!</p>
<p>What has been happening around here.  First things got crazy busy in the shop, and that put my posting on hold.  Then because it got crazy busy, I let the stress get to me.  This is where I fall face first into the wine/chocolate/you name it!</p>
<p>Do I use food to relieve my stress?  Yes I do.  Why?  Because it actually makes me feel better.  I have really thought about this.  There are folks out there that say, its just this or that, and it&#8217;s a false feeling of peace when you eat yada yada yada.  So how do you explain the feeling of peace, and almost instant relaxation when I do?  Yes it lasts!  This is usually another argument.  That it will only last as long as it takes to eat it, or it will only last for another hour after I&#8217;ve eaten it.  No&#8230;I&#8217;m good for the night!  Ready to start the day again in the morning&#8230;.where the cycle starts all over.</p>
<p>Alright, so I got stressed out and I ate.  I got over it&#8230;then what happened?</p>
<p>I was at a vendor market and took a pretty bad fall that ended up needing chiropractic work, and massages to work out the pain.  That worked, but by this time I was so deeply ingrossed in my addictive behaviour that I didn&#8217;t even bother trying to come up for air.</p>
<p>I start thinking more &#8220;Beck&#8221; like and I start to pull myself back together, then&#8230;..</p>
<p>I end up in the emergency room after eating some sort of nut.  I took it easy the next 2 days after this, but food hasn&#8217;t been good.</p>
<p>I get going very good during the day, but the evenings have me fuddled.  Yes I understand I have a sugar sensitivity. I understand that it isn&#8217;t just a lack of willpower.  But sometimes it sure feels that way.  I&#8217;ve even tried to stay away from the tv, and to keep myself busy.  I s&#8217;pose I just need to fill my time a bit more.  It&#8217;s nice to just rest too.</p>
<p>Then what?  There couldn&#8217;t possibly be more right!?  We had our new grandbaby born into the family.  A little bit of heaven mixed in with all the stress and addictions!  She is beautiful and perfect!</p>
<p>It is going to feel wonderful to get back to &#8220;Sane Eating&#8221;.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8230;or most.  How ever they want to word it.</p>
<p>This topic was spurned on by a comment made to me by someone on twitter.  Pretty much telling me that sugar has gotten a bad rap, I need to eat it in moderation, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Yah&#8230;Ok&#8230;.has he/she lived thru the friggin cravings that make your mind go crazy with the need to get a fix of sugar?!?  No I&#8217;m thinking they haven&#8217;t had to deal with it.</p>
<p>One size does <strong>NOT</strong> fit all!</p>
<p>Just like one diet does not work for everyone!</p>
<p>So let me ask this?  If I am dealing with an alcoholic, would I tell that person that alcohol has gotten a bad rap?  That it&#8217;s ok to drink, just drink wisely.</p>
<p><strong>No</strong></p>
<p>My blog and my twitter profile pretty much sum it up.  I am a sugar and food addict.  I cannot stop eating.  But alcoholics can stop drinking. I can stop eating sugar, but too often sugar gets put into things I do not suspect.  This often starts the cravings right back up.  As well as other foods that will sometimes trigger cravings, like bread, wine, potatoes, salad dressings etc.  Sugar is everywhere.  For those of us who cannot deal with it&#8230;.it is a big deal!</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m on a rant&#8230;.I&#8217;d like to discuss something else.</p>
<p>Nuts!</p>
<p>If you are allergic to nuts you will understand where I&#8217;m coming from.  If you are NOT allergic to nuts please keep reading, because you need to understand just how dangerous this is.</p>
<p>I was at an event last week.  I thought i made good choices.  15 minutes later, I was starting to have nut allergy symptoms.  I still cannot tell you where the nuts where.  Usually as soon as I have a nut in my mouth, it starts to bubble up and my throat starts to swell.  Every time in the past I have been able to get the nuts out of my mouth, drink lots of water and I&#8217;m uncomfortable for a while, but I&#8217;m ok.</p>
<p>Not this time!</p>
<p>I ended up in the hospital via an ambulance.  I can tell you I scared the hell out of my husband, myself and many of the neighbours who were on the sidewalk at 1:30 in the morning.</p>
<p>When you are going to an event and you are asked to bring a dish, either check to see if anyone is allergic to nuts or leave them OUT!</p>
<p>Nuts include the actual nut meat, nut oils or nut flours.  Its all nuts!  We react the same way.  However some of us react later when the nuts are well hidden in the ingredients&#8230;such as flours or oils.  Only this time it was alot more dangerous!  And No, we cannot eat around them!</p>
<p>Putting an ingredient in food that could be potentially deadly is careless and down right stupid!  Keep that stuff for who you know!</p>

Home Exercise Program for:  Robin</p>
<p><strong>Squat Row</strong></p>
<p>Load the cable column machine with 45lbs and put the rope attachment on the lower cable.  Hold onto the rope with both hands with your arms extended.  Squat down, then stand and pull the rope up to your chest as you pull your shoulder blades together.  Hold this position for 1 second, then slowly release.</p>
<p>Repeat for 3 x’s 12.</p>
<p><strong>Lat Pull Down</strong></p>
<p>On the lat pull down machine, sit facing the weight stack and place your hands slight greater than shoulder width apart (and just past the bend of the bar).  Load the machined with 45lbs.  Exhale and pull the bar down to your chest by lower your elbows, inhale and slowly release the bar, making sure to pull your shoulder blades down toward your back pocket (ensuring your shoulders do not come up).</p>
<p>Repeat for 3 x’s 12.</p>
<p><strong>Single Snatch</strong></p>
<p>Hold onto an 8lb dumbbell with your R hand, with your arm extended, and your palm facing back.  Squat down, and as you stand, lift the dumbbell up to your R shoulder making sure to keep the dumbbell close to your body.</p>
<p>Repeat for 3 x’s 12, and then alternate.</p>
<p><strong>Shoulder Fly</strong></p>
<p>Stand with your feet staggered.  The forward knee bent, and on your hind toes.  Bend your elbow slightly, and hold a 5lb dumbbell in each hand with each facing one another.  Open your arms and squeeze your shoulder blades together.</p>
<p>Repeat for 2 x’s 15.</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong></p>
<p>Stand in a squat position with your feet about hips width apart and your knees supple.  Hold onto 5lb dumbbells in each hand, with your palms facing up.  With your elbows slightly bent, raise them up to shoulder height.  Hold for 1 second, then slowly release and return to your starting position.</p>
<p>Repeat for 3 x’s 12.</p>
<p><strong>Ball Crunches</strong></p>
<p>Sit on the large ball, and roll forward until it is on the small of your back.  Place your hands behind your head, and crunch up with your chin up toward the ceiling.</p>
<p>Repeat for 3 x’s 12.</p>
<p><strong>Oblique Crunches</strong></p>
<p>Assume the same position as the above ball crunches.  Crunch up and twist bring your R shoulder up and over.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes we think we are going mad.  The sugar cravings are so bad, that you are eating things you would never think of.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-223" title="sugar-cubes1" src="http://www.foodandsugaraddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sugar-cubes1-300x199.jpg" alt="sugar-cubes1" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p>That brain of ours has ways of getting the body what it craves.  If it means sprinkling brown sugar on buttered bread&#8230;.because that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s in the house.  That&#8217;s what you do.</p>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve sworn off sugar, but you are replacing it with something else.  Ive done this many times. </p>
<p>Quit drinking coffee, only to replace it with chocolate.</p>
<p>Quit eating sugar only to replace it with wine (enough to make the neighbours comment when they see the recycling box)</p>
<p>One of MY biggest contributors to my sugar issues were: PCOS, Yeast gone Wild and Heredity!  Lets not forget that sugar addiction and alcoholism are very closely linked. </p>
<p>Have you noticed that recovering alcoholics eat quite a bit of sugary candies or large amounts of carbs? </p>
<p>Here is my take on this&#8230;if you have alcoholism in your family, you already know that this is a disease.  You also know that it is hereditary.  If you have sugar addicts or alcoholism on either side of your family you are at risk!  Lucky me, one side has both sugar and alcoholism and the other has food and sugar addiction.  I lucked out didn&#8217;t I!?!?!</p>
<p>So knowing all this, I have a better understanding of where I come from.  I also understand that it isn&#8217;t my fault.  What is my fault is how I am choosing to deal with it.  Getting the cravings under control can be done!</p>
<h2>Yeast!</h2>
<p>Do you have too much of it?  I <strong>DO NOT</strong> suggest you eat yogurt to control it.  Why?  Because yeast feeds on sugar, and today&#8217;s yogurts are full of sugar.  If they aren&#8217;t they are full of sweeteners which fool your body into thinking it&#8217;s been given sugar and still sends out the insulin to take care of it.  Results: you get fatter!</p>
<p>Yeast feeds on sugar!  So stop feeding it!  One of the best indicators of too much yeast is recurring yeast infections.  If you find you need a trip to the drug store every couple months for &#8220;stuff&#8221;.  You definitely have too much yeast in your system.</p>
<h2>How Do You Stop Feeding Yeast?</h2>
<ol>
<li>ingest absolutely NO sugar of any kind!</li>
<li>ingest absolutely NO sweetener of any kind!</li>
<li>do not eat anything fermented eg. cheese, vinegar, wine, bread, beer, pickles, yogurt, etc,</li>
<li>do not eat any type of grain &#8230;these are usually sitting in a silo someplace growing mold</li>
<li>do not eat any mold of any kind eg. blue cheese, mushrooms, sour cream, sour milk, dried fruits, pickled or smoked meats, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>What you do want to eat is fresh vegetables and lean clean protein. </p>
<p>If you are missing your vinegar in your salad dressing, use lemon juice instead.</p>
<h2>How long should I eat like this?</h2>
<p>1 to 2 weeks!  Then start adding back into your diet <strong>slowly  </strong>lower carb choices.  Such as cheese, pickles, mushrooms, mustard etc.  If you start to notice the cravings coming back, cut those items back out.  Repeat the process until you feel confident that the yeast is no longer telling you what to do.</p>
<h2>What then?</h2>
<p>Make a commitment to yourself to keep sugar and white flour out of your diet.  Sometimes it is hidden and you don&#8217;t even realize you&#8217;ve eaten it.  Like the time Mike and I came home from Applebee&#8217;s.  I had just finished a huge taco salad.  When I got home I found myself standing infront of the fridge looking for something to eat.  There is no way I should have been hungry.  No way at all!!  But I was&#8230;or at least that is what my brain was telling me.  It was a crazy hunger too.  That is when I realized I had eaten something in that salad that was laced with sugar and I didn&#8217;t even notice it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is just the first step&#8230;.but it will get you started!</p>

<p>Some of you who know me, know that I come from a place where canoeing, fishing, camping and large fresh water lakes are a way of life.  Something I used to do all the time. </p>
<p>Fast forward 13 years, and here I am too big to enjoy what I used to love to do.  No, I&#8217;m not too big, but I &#8220;feel&#8221; too big.  Does that make sense?  I&#8217;ve put myself in the way of myself and what I enjoy.  Is it an excuse?  Yes I suppose it is.  But would you put yourself thru something that made you feel unbearably uncomfortable?  I also suppose after another 20lbs gone, I will feel a bit better in my skin and I will come a bit more out of my shell.</p>
<p>Here is what I am looking forward to&#8230;</p>
<ol>
<li>being able to lift a kayak on my own to put it ontop of the car</li>
<li>going on canoe and camping trips</li>
<li>fitting in the rides at 6 flags</li>
<li>clothing that fits properly</li>
<li>ditching the sweat shirts I&#8217;ve been wearing all winter because that was all that fit and was warm</li>
<li>not sucking wind when I climb more than 3 flights of stairs</li>
<li>sex! (its always better when you aren&#8217;t worried about what you look like isn&#8217;t it?!!!)</li>
<li>gardening that doesn&#8217;t take me weeks instead of a weekend.</li>
<li>bike riding with my daughter this summer</li>
<li>feeling pretty and sexy (most days its easy to ignore the mirror and the extra 100lbs)</li>
<li>moving into the &#8220;overweight&#8221; category from &#8220;<strong>obese</strong>&#8220;</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a list of &#8220;what are you waiting for&#8217;s&#8221;.  It is a realistic list of things you have a difficult time doing now, and knowing that when the pounds start coming off, you will feel better doing.</p>
<p>How about you&#8230;.what are you looking forward to?</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m at it&#8230;what did you do today to make yourself feel absolutely wonderful?  I went to work out, I did good.  Felt good!  But then I was tired LOL.  Maybe I&#8217;ll get a delayed &#8220;WooHoo&#8221; feeling tomorrow?</p>
<p> </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> </p>
<p>Sometimes we start out on our weight loss journey and we either forget or put off something we have been wanting to do until we&#8217;ve lost &#8220;x&#8221; number of pounds.  <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-178" title="necklace" src="http://www.foodandsugaraddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/necklace-300x197.jpg" alt="necklace" width="300" height="197" /></p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s all fine and well.  But why are you waiting?</p>
<p>Did you want to go get a new hairstyle?  Then go!  If you want, make that new hair-do a 5lb reward.  Once you reach that 5lb loss, make your appointment and go!</p>
<p>Have you been wanting that new skin care product you seen at a party, or commercial?  Do you think you don&#8217;t deserve it?  How about pretty jewellery?</p>
<p>Getting my nails done is something I struggled with.  Because in my mind, fat women didn&#8217;t have pretty painted nails.  I know, its a bit warped&#8230;but I never said it was normal in there.  Besides, my hands are the thinnest part of my body.  Have you ever met a 250+ pound woman with a size 5.5 ring finger?  I have the thin pretty hands I associated with thin pretty women.  They just weren&#8217;t attached to the thin body.  No matter, I worked the mess out in my head, and went to have them done. </p>
<p>I loved my pretty red painted finger nails!  They made me feel good. </p>
<p>What are you doing to feel good &amp;  look great while you are loosing weight?</p>
<p>I am making sure I&#8217;m putting my face on everyday.  All of it&#8230;nothing left in the makeup bag!  When I eat properly, exercise and drink my water and green tea, my skin glows.  I just love it!  So I make sure I take care of my skin, and enhance everything I&#8217;ve got!  Even when you are in the morbidly obese category, it&#8217;s still nice when your spouse/partner tells you how pretty or beautiful you look. </p>
<p>Another to-do for me.  Staying out of the clothing stores.  I went earlier this week, and I won&#8217;t be back for a while.  Trying on clothes that just are not properly made for large women is never fun.  From my arm pits up Im still a medium/large&#8230;.the rest is between 2 and 3X.  Going around looking like a linebacker is not my idea of looking and feeling good.</p>
<p>Another feel good to-do.  Being part of a support group that recognizes your accomplishments.  No matter how small those accomplishments are.  Sometimes that &#8220;little&#8221; thing was a really &#8220;big&#8221; thing, and the group &#8220;gets it&#8221;.  </p>
<p>In lieu of clothing I like to buy pretty smelling body wash for the shower.  Its so nice after a hard workout to come out of the shower feeling pretty! </p>
<p>Just be sure you are not trading a <strong>food addiction</strong> for  a shopping addiction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How about you?  What do you do?</p>
<p> </p>

<h2>&#8230;and What We Hide</h2>
<p>One of my very first memories of having uncontrollable sugar cravings was when I was about 9 yrs old.  The need for sugar was so bad, I walked to the corner grocery store and stuffed my pockets with prepackaged butter tarts! I ate every single one of them on the way home and I felt so much better.  Now if you don&#8217;t know what a butter tart is, it is basically liquefied brown sugar, corn syrup, butter and egg in a pastry shell.  Maybe toss in a few raisins too.  So I got my fix.</p>
<p>But this was about the time I started having serious issues. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d make toast and load it up with butter and then put brown sugar all over it.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-146" title="sugar-cubes" src="http://www.foodandsugaraddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/sugar-cubes-300x225.jpg" alt="sugar-cubes" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d just butter bread and sprinkle white sugar on the butter.</p>
<p>Make popcorn, and melt butter with brown sugar mixed in and pour that all over the popcorn.</p>
<p>Any cookies mom made usually only lasted in the house for about 2 days.</p>
<p>When you are a kid, and you don&#8217;t have any money, you find ways to get your sugar fix. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I&#8217;m older now&#8230;.I should know better right?  No, that gnawing in my brain is still there.  But now I know how to control it with a better diet!</p>
<p>Hiding things and telling lies seem to be a common denominator for an <strong>addict</strong>.  No matter what it is.  Drugs, alcohol, sex, food!</p>
<p>When was the last time you hid what you were eating? Do you wait until your spouse/partner goes to bed?  Do you raid the cupboards and fridge then?  Do you sneak down to the fridge and eat the last of the pizza?  Do you eat the entire cake and tell your spouse/partner that you thru it out because you were starting your diet that day?  Have you sat in the wegmans parking lot after grocery shopping, and stuffed marshmallows in your face, or chocolate, or a bag of cookies, or an entire bag of potato chips, or even a whole box of ice cream treats you knew you could get all in before you got home with your &#8220;diet food&#8221;?</p>
<p>Have you gone running errands, and made a pit stop at your favorite &#8220;supplier&#8221; and loaded up with goodies to eat in the car?  Have you gone out just to eat the sugary/cakey items you didn&#8217;t want anyone else to know about.  Have you eaten everything in your car just so you didn&#8217;t have to share it when you got home?  Hidden food in your purse so you could sneak eat it when no one was looking?</p>
<p>Have you lied to yourself?  Telling yourself you really don&#8217;t eat that much. </p>
<p>Telling your spouse/partner that you didn&#8217;t have any dessert or that you ate what you were suppose to.</p>
<p>Telling your child you cannot go to the fairgrounds, because you get too dizzy when you go on the rides.  When the truth is y0u don&#8217;t fit in the rides.</p>
<p>Making excuses to your spouse/partner for not wanting to attend an event just because you feel too fat and ashamed.</p>
<p>Telling your child you just don&#8217;t want to go for a bike ride, because you are too tired.  Truth is, you feel huge ontop of that bike frame.</p>
<p>Not working out when you told your spouse/partner that you did.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve all done it.  In one form or another.  If you are an addict, you understand.  You may be reading this and think&#8230;.this woman is off  her friggin rocker!  Then you probably don&#8217;t have a food addiction.  But if you get it, if you cried or teared when you read this, because you understand&#8230;.then we are both in the same boat. </p>
<h3>How Are You Coping?</h3>
<p>What changes have you made?  Some of the things I have done include:</p>
<ul>
<li>buying a new smaller purse that doesn&#8217;t zip closed</li>
<li>taking Mike with me when I want to go out in the evenings (no matter how much he complains)</li>
<li>stopped eating in the car</li>
<li>going to bed at the same time or before Mike (keeps me out of the kitchen)</li>
<li>stopped eating after 8pm!</li>
<li>changed my food plan to help combat the sugar cravings</li>
<li>working &#8220;<a href="http://astore.amazon.com/buffagraph0b-20/detail/0848731735" target="_blank">The Beck Diet Solution</a>&#8220;</li>
<li>planning out my weeks worth of food</li>
<li>cooking on weekends to make sure I eat what is planned</li>
<li>started working with a personal trainer.  One that cares!  She may not understand the addiction (I don&#8217;t really know) But she cares enough to help any way she can.</li>
<li>when Mike wants some sort of &#8220;goodie&#8221; he&#8217;ll ask if it&#8217;s ok with me.  He wants to know if him eating it will bother me. </li>
<li>telling Mike what I am going thru.  What issues I may be having that day.  He may not know what to do about it, but he &#8220;gets it&#8221;.  That in itself has been very helpful.</li>
</ul>
<p>My plan this summer is to get on that bicycle and bike around with my daughter!  Get out to darien lake and put my butt in those dizzy rides and have a blast with my daughter!  Get out in a kayak and paddle around the waters in the buffalo area. </p>
<p>Making food a non-issue! </p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s time to get back to living!</strong></p>

<p>Here is a very simple recipe and  had my husband looking for more.  If you know my husband&#8230;.he NEVER looks for more vegetables!!!  NEVER!</p>
<p>Spray your non-stick grill pan with some pam.</p>
<p>Trim the hard woody looking bits off the bottom of the asparagus</p>
<p>I placed the asparagus on a plate, and drizzled a little bit of <strong>olive oil</strong> all over them.  Get your hands in there and mix it all up so each spear is very lightly coated.  Place in your pan and take a pinch of <strong>sea salt</strong> and sprinkle it all over.</p>
<p>Put the pan on a hot grill and grill for about 3 min or until they are hot through out and bright green.</p>
<p>Done! Delish!</p>

<p>Last night&#8217;s supper was steel head trout, Caesar salad and a baked potato.  Now since I had been having issues with cravings and not getting enough food, I thought I&#8217;d try the potato.  In my head I said to myself, &#8220;eat the fish and salad first.  If you still want more, have the potato.&#8221;  Well of course that isn&#8217;t exactly how it all played thru. <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-103" title="fish" src="http://www.foodandsugaraddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/fish-300x199.jpg" alt="fish" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p>I ate the fish first because it was absolutely delicious! I blobbed a heaping tsp of lite sour cream with fresh chopped chives from the garden ontop of my potato.  Leaving the salad in the bowl. </p>
<p><strong>Addiction</strong> and habits are very hard to break.  After finishing my fish, I went right for the potato.  Why?  I really don&#8217;t know.  Knowing I should be eating the salad first before diving into the potato, I started on the green stuff. </p>
<p>Here is the really cool part.  After practising the Beck way of living, I recognize when I am full.  Not just stuffed, but when my stomach is satisfied.  I had finished 1/2 my small potato, and still had about 1/4 of my salad left to eat.  I left it all. </p>
<p>This is really hard for someone like me.  It is hard to rationalize in my brain that throwing it out is not wasting it.  Because if I ate it, it would still go to waist.  See my point? </p>
<p>Last night brought on what I call &#8220;ghost hunger&#8221;.  I have eaten maybe 2.5 hours before.  A good balanced meal&#8230;and the big clue that it was still in my belly?  I was still burping fish and garlicy salad! So I KNEW I really wasn&#8217;t hungry.  What was it?  I really don&#8217;t know.  I had a glass of water, then made my herbal tea, and everything seemed to be fine. </p>
<p>In the past I would have taken that &#8220;ghost hunger&#8221; and fed it with potato chips, chocolate, wine&#8230;what ever I could get my hands on.  When you are trying to train yourself to recognize true hunger, this one can be a bit tricky.</p>
<p>Just remember that &#8220;hunger is NOT an emergency&#8221;</p>

<p>It has been a little bit of a struggle, but I have my cravings under control.  I know how to do it, I know what effects them, I just need to apply my research and knowledge.  Sometimes however the very last thing I want to do is to do what I am &#8220;suppose&#8221; to do.  Go figure.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-92" title="fat-vs-muscle" src="http://www.foodandsugaraddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/fat-vs-muscle-300x178.jpg" alt="fat-vs-muscle" width="300" height="178" /></p>
<p>Here you can see 5 pounds of fat and 5 pounds of muscle.  Since starting this blog I&#8217;ve lost 10 of those fat pounds!  (2 of those chunks!) Can you image?  Stack 10 pounds of butter 2 x 2 and that&#8217;s what is gone.  Sometimes we loose sight of just how much 1 pound looks like.  When dealing with large amounts of weightloss, we tend to think in large volume.  So remember those stacked butter pounds every time you get on the scale.</p>
<p>You probably read in my last post that I will be working with Michelle.  She is going to be helping me build strong muscle, and helping to get me much leaner.  One of the keys to fighting <strong>obesity </strong>is building muscle.  I want my own little fat burners attached right to my very own body.  No drugs, no pills, no magic potions to burn the fat.  I am going to be building muscle that is going to burn that crud in my sleep!  How much easier can that be?  Yah, ok&#8230;&#8230;the fat burning during my sleep will be easy.  The muscle building will be a little more difficult.  That&#8217;s ok.</p>
<p>What did I do this week to help take the edge off my <strong>sugar addiction</strong> and get the<strong> food addiction</strong> under control<strong>?</strong></p>
<p>1.  Cut all grains/fruits/sugar out of my diet.</p>
<p>2.  Drank gallons of water.</p>
<p>3.  Absolutely no food after 8pm. (the kitchen is closed!)</p>
<p>4.  Pre-made/planned all lunches for the week.</p>
<p>5.  Cleaned/washed/stored the veggies I was going to be eating for snacks</p>
<p>6.  Cleaned/washed/stored the lettuce I bought.  Rather than using the pre-bagged stuff that has a funky flavor!</p>
<p>7.  I worked out!!!</p>
<h3>Smart choices I made this past week.  </h3>
<p>1.  Skipped lunch at networking meeting and ate what I had planned for myself</p>
<p>2.  When we ate out at Kosta&#8217;s tonight, I asked our server for a take-away box as soon as she brought me my souvlaki.  Half my meal went right into the box before I started eating or putting any dressing ontop of it.  I now have tomorrows lunch!</p>
<h3>Plans/Prep for next week</h3>
<p>1.  New celery container for the fridge was purchased</p>
<p>2.  New  lettuce/veggie keeper was purchased so I can prep more lettuce/veggies at one time</p>
<p>3.  New juice container was purchased so I can start making my iced green tea in batches (Mike snagged my old container)</p>
<p>4.  Made appointment with <a href="http://www.healthandfitsolutions.com" target="_blank">Michelle</a> for Monday morning. </p>
<p>5.  New flavor soup needs to be made for next week&#8217;s lunchs and I think I might like some deviled eggs to have with my protein shakes in the mornings. (I&#8217;ll post the recipe after I decide what I might fancy)</p>
<p>6.  Grocery shopping!!</p>
<h3>Plan for success!</h3>

<p>Do you do this?</p>
<p>I am not going to wait this time.  I have a hair appointment on Saturday morning, then when that is finished I&#8217;m heading out to Cold Water Creek for some pretty new tops I seen in their catalogue!  AND I have a 30% off coupon!  Life is good!</p>
<p>Ive also signed signed on with <strong>Mary Kay</strong>!  I know, I know, I&#8217;m the the <strong>Mary Kay</strong> type!!!!!  No kidding!  But I love love love the skin care products.  So I thought I would get set up, and offer a place for folks to go without having to deal with &#8220;<strong>The Mary Kay</strong>&#8221; lady!  So if you don&#8217;t have a Mary Kay Lady go here to get one! <a href="http://www.marykay.com/wintergirl">www.marykay.com/wintergirl</a></p>
<p>Besides when I put my face on for special events, I like it to last the night.  There is nothing worse than going to all the trouble to look good, only to have it all soaked in or brushed off after about 2 hours.  Mary Kay has some amazing products that help combat that problem!</p>
<h2>Ok on to the AWESOMEST news!!!!</h2>
<p>My Personal Trainer (Michelle Mullen who is the owner of  <a href="http://www.healthandfitsolutions.com">www.healthandfitsolutions.com</a> ) is going to be working with me right here on the blog!!  That means she gets to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">yell at</span> support me&#8230;here!</p>
<p>We will be including weekly weigh ins, measurements, video, podcasts, and visits to some skinny chick&#8217;s fridges!!  Its going to be awesome!</p>
<p>Here is the thing&#8230;..I&#8217;m scared!  Of what?  Of succeeding.  I need to get out of my own way, and get to where I want to be and to <strong>stay</strong> there!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been fighting <strong>obesity</strong> and <strong>addiction </strong>for too long.  It got old 25 yrs ago!!  So Michelle said she is happy to be the &#8220;cement&#8221; in my commitment!</p>
<p>Keep watching, we plan to do some fun/cool things for you all to peek in on.</p>
<p>Remember if you want to comment, head over to the &#8220;About&#8221; page and leave a comment there.  Im hoping to have the comments on this page fixed this week.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">Well, that’s what was happening to me last night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">I had been wanting something sweet all day and all night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had been putting myself off all day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I didn’t want to go out by myself last night, because I knew that was my perfect time to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>While I was alone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">My first thoughts yesterday were, my husband is at work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I’ll just walk over to the market and pick up a few things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I can have everything eaten and all the garbage tossed out and he’d never know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I thought, yes that’s a good idea I’ll do that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But the dieting Robin kept putting it off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I’d look at the clock and think, “ok, I’ve got 2 hours yet, I can still go to the market.” I managed to put all that off until he came home at 4:30.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Then he wanted to go for coffee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I really didn’t want to leave the house.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>You know sometimes, just leaving that space you have made “safe” from any external triggers and going anywhere else would break thru that barrier you’ve built for yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">Off we went, had our coffee, and a little ride around the marina.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Ok, that wasn’t so bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>We got home, I made supper and everything was ok.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>My inner fatchick wasn’t messing with my head. </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">She started up again about an hour after I had eaten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>No I wasn’t hungry, I just wanted something sweet. I wanted it KNOW!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>I had finished all the yogurt covered raisins, had the fruit salad, had a muffin…but all this just wasn’t satisfying the sweet attack I seemed to be in the throws of.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">I just kept putting it off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had enough stuff yesterday I shouldn’t have.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I had more than enough to eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">But you know when you want something, you try to replace it with something else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>In my case I kept trying to replace it with other foods.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Guess I shouldn’t have done that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">My last effort came in the form of orville redebacker popcorn.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Thinking in my warped brain, it’s a grain that will turn to sugar in my system and that should make everything happy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Nope that wasn’t it either.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">I finished the popcorn, and I lasted until 10 o’clock when hubby went to bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I got up off the couch, and proceeded to make 2 sandwiches.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>One cheese, and one chicken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>More of that sneak eating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I should have just gone to bed with him.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>But by 10 I was ready to stuff my inner fatchick.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>I was so tired of fighting her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Well, it didn’t work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Because I’m still looking for sugar this morning.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 4.8pt 4.8pt 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="color: #000000;">I know I can build a wall around her to keep her quiet.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>That wall is eating properly all the time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Keeping the sugar cravings to little twinges of desire rather than all out wars against my true desires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>I know it sounds convoluted, but after all these years of dieting, I know what works for me. This works for me!</p>
<p>Just pick your one diet, then have a back up incase you want to switch over after a couple weeks.</p>
<p>The point of this is to not feel like you have failed at this. Just pick up the next one, and soldier on!</p>
<p>Today is actually day 3 for me&#8230;.I&#8217;ll post that later on tonight.</p>
<p>So what did you do today to feel absolutely wonderful?<br />
I went for a color consultation with my Mary Kay lady! Ive never been a mary kay kinda person, never wanted to be bothered with all that stuff. But I love their skin care products! Especially having pcos I have to be careful what I use. My facial skin tends to thicken when I use exfoliators. This stuff doesnt do that. It also helps with my dark chin too&#8230;.evens out my skin tone. I love it&#8230;.so much I will probably have a link to the products here in the blog within the next couple days.</p>
<p>Ok&#8230;so what did you do?(I have pretty purple eye shadow on to show off my sparkly brown eyes) LOL</p>
<p>Have an awesome day everyone!</p>

<p>One of the benefits of being a yo-yo dieter I have seen what I look like at different weights. Not just at different weights, but also the same weight several years apart. (did that make sense?)</p>
<p>Here is a visual. The first photo was taken about 11 yrs ago in Florida. My first ever visit to the ocean. The second photo was take about 4 yrs ago. I finally got back down to 195. The most exercise I did back then was walking. As good as that was, it wasn&#8217;t enough. These pants are size 20.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-47" title="in-the-ocean1" src="http://www.foodandsugaraddiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/in-the-ocean1-300x231.jpg" alt="in-the-ocean1" width="300" height="231" /></p>
<p>This was after loosing what I put back on, and started the Body For Life workout program. No question in my mind which photo looks better. 195 here as well. Yes I know I&#8217;ve got a little person stuck in front of me hiding me. (but wasn&#8217;t that the point when the photo was taken?) These jeans are a size 16.</p>

<p>No matter what you do for exercise, be sure to incorporate some sort of resistance training. It builds great bones, packs your body a bit tighter (we all need that don&#8217;t we ladies?) and you don&#8217;t have to run to &#8220;strong-oh&#8221; hubby to open jars for you!</p>
<p>The book I used for resistance training was <strong><a href="http://astore.amazon.com/buffagraph0b-20/detail/0060193395">Body For Life</a></strong>, by Bill Phillips. I love this book for the excellent guide it offered me. I still like to go back to it when Im starting over and need to get back to it.</p>
<p>A bit of a warning tho. If you are a <strong>food or sugar addict</strong>, I suggest you do NOT follow his food plan. It worked well enough for me, until I got to the &#8220;free&#8221; day. Which turned into a free-for-all. Ultimately derailed me. I also do not like having to think about food all the time. I just want to eat what Ive planned, then wait until the next feeding time. For me it has to be that way&#8230;..otherwise I&#8217;ll eat all day.</p>
<p>Folks if you want to comment on this, please go over to the &#8220;about&#8221; page and post comments there, with the title of this post in your comments so I will know what you are commenting on. I have to do this until I can figure out what I did to the comments on this page. They dissappeared! (yah I did it, I just don&#8217;t know how to fix it)</p>

<p>I recommitted today! April 19, 2009.</p>
<p>I did what I should not have done last night. I am one of those “all or nothing” type people. Something I really need to learn to rein in.</p>
<p>I ate to feel the emotions. Did it feel good? Yes at the time it did. Does it feel good now? No, I still have a sugar headache.</p>
<p>Some of the things that happen to me when I’m not eating properly:<br />
(or eating too much crappy nutritionally void foods)</p>
<p>1. my hair falls out by the handfuls (its looking pretty scraggly right now)<br />
2. my skin gets irritated and my eczema flairs up<br />
3. I get fat (duh!) You’d think I had this one figured out<br />
4. my feet hurt<br />
5. I get winded much faster<br />
6. I have almost constant headaches<br />
7. crave more sugar<br />
8. crave more flour based items (donuts, bread, pasta etc)<br />
9. my teeth bother me (strange I know)</p>
<p>When I eat properly<br />
1. I have beautiful glossy curly hair<br />
2. my skin isn’t bothering me at all<br />
3. I loose weight<br />
4. my feet do not hurt<br />
5. I can walk the treadmill or neighbourhood without sucking wind!<br />
6. a bottle of ibuprofen lasts for months<br />
7. I don’t crave anything!<br />
8. my teeth are just fine</p>
<p>Ok…so what’s the problem you might ask? Ha! I’ve been trying to figure that out for years!</p>
<p>Stay tuned….it’s coming to me.</p>
