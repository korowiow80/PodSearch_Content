&lt;p&gt;The recession has gotten people stressed, worried, and a bit resentful. We all have to cut back on expense, and this can be difficult. Saving money is important, but more so our flagging sense of enjoyment. So what will make us feel better?

<p>The recession has gotten people stressed, worried, and a bit resentful. We all have to cut back on expense, and this can be difficult. Saving money is important, but more so our flagging sense of enjoyment. So what will make us feel better? First, we have to know what we have and appreciate it. The recession forces you to be more creative. And rather than resisting change, we could simply accept things as they are and make the decision to lead a much simpler life. Rather than constantly struggling, we can now enjoy what we can still have despite the struggles we all will have to live with. You must never see it as having less. You&#8217;re simply appreciating what you have more now.</p>
<p>A good way to handle difficulties is to make a success list. Write down all your accomplishments, even the most trivial ones. Run through the day&#8217;s events and actively look for the highlights. Give yourself a pat on the back because even when things have gotten difficult, you&#8217;re still standing on both feet. While it is easier said than done, you still need to look into your strengths. All you need is faith in yourself. Things will definitely change, and this won&#8217;t happen if you just sulk and moan about your situation. While you have problems, you&#8217;ll always hear people tell you to ask for help. You often forget that you actually have people who are willing to lend a helping hand or two. While the bulk of the responsibility falls on your shoulders, it&#8217;s still nice to know that you have people who care about your wellbeing.</p>
<p>Moreover, give yourself permission to change your mind. You stress out on so many decisions because you immediately assume that these would be the end-all and be-all of your future. The truth is, you can try something out and reevaluate if it doesn&#8217;t work. Right now, decide on something and if it doesn&#8217;t work, you can always do something else. Give yourself a chance to make mistakes because this is how you learn. As they say, there is no better teacher than experience itself. Look at this as added wisdom for you because you know better the next time you come across the same experience.</p>
<p>Create a life that works for you and make no apologies for it. After all, you&#8217;re old enough to think and decide for yourself. With that empowering thought in mind, you are likely to be more confident about the road you choose to take. Get moving and walk away from things that bring out anger. When you give in to frustration, you may end up getting embarrassed. Look for the lessons that are meant to be learned in every experience. As bogus as this is for some people, there is a reason for everything. The weakest ones are weeded out and the stronger ones are left with more room for growth. Life, after all, is about taking risks and finding out just what you can do despite adversity.</p>

&lt;p&gt;Your attitude can make or break you. It&amp;#8217;s virtually indisputable that your attitude determines how far you&amp;#8217;ll go in life and a positive mental outlook can help you achieve optimal success.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Your attitude can make or break you. It&#8217;s virtually indisputable that your attitude determines how far you&#8217;ll go in life and a positive mental outlook can help you achieve optimal success.</p>
<p>Having a positive mental attitude helps you cope with challenges. When you&#8217;re put to the test, you&#8217;re more likely to find your inner strengths to overcome adversity, and that strength just might be your winning attitude. Whether or not you have the tools, skills, knowledge, or resources, your attitude can get you through tough times and come out on top.</p>
<p>On the other hand, an attitude filled with negative overtones makes everything much harder. You can&#8217;t win when you go into the contest prepared to lose! If you expect to do well, your attitude will create positive, winning thoughts that help you succeed.</p>
<p>Cause and Effect</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to realize that for every effect in our lives, there&#8217;s a specific cause. Through positive thoughts, we can control these causes and change effects or outcomes.</p>
<p>?    In order to change your future for the better, you must first alter your thoughts in the present.</p>
<p>For every positive seed you plant, your thoughts will grow and reward you with a positive harvest. Negative seeds have the opposite effect. They&#8217;ll grow, but result in a spoiled and fruitless crop. You can&#8217;t plant negative seeds in your mind and expect positive results. It just doesn&#8217;t work that way.</p>
<p>A vivid and defining difference between people who are successful and those who aren&#8217;t is the way they think. Successful people visualize their goals and take action to make them happen.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful people dwell on the negative, spend their time and energy complaining, and worry about things that are unimportant. This negativity wastes time and energy that could be harnessed toward achieving your goals.</p>
<p>Practice Makes Perfect</p>
<p>If you hone your positive thinking skills and develop the mental attitudes of a winner, you&#8217;ll be able to overcome challenges without giving up. No matter how discouraging things may get or how intently others may try to dissuade you, with your winning attitude, you will be unstoppable!</p>
<p>A positive outlook enables you to focus on your goals with a tunnel vision that eliminates negative distractions and keeps you on a chartered course to success.</p>
<p>?    Train your mind to focus on the good. Develop a positive mantra or affirmation to help you overlook the negative and realize the power of optimism.<br />
Train Your Mind</p>
<p>We often worry about our physical fitness, but do we think much about the fitness of our minds? Just as we train our bodies for peak performance, we must also train our minds by coaching ourselves to think winning thoughts.</p>
<p>An effective way to train your mind is to look at challenges as opportunities instead of obstacles. A problem is only a problem if you allow it to be one. With each challenge comes an opportunity to learn and improve. So if you search for solutions, you&#8217;ll find them.</p>
<p>When you internalize this mindset, you&#8217;re sure to develop a winning attitude for a lifetime and reap the rewards of true success and happiness.</p>

<p>Has stress pushed you to the danger zone? If it has, you may notice that you&#8217;ve stopped caring for others. After years of dedication with your job, you may run out of steam. In fact, millions of people are at risk of a burnout. No one is immune, regardless of age, gender, or job. In fact, it&#8217;s a condition that can attack everyone equally. Many people get to a point where there&#8217;s an imbalance between their own feelings of being human and their confrontation with difficult, distressful issues on a daily basis. Things will tilt further if you don&#8217;t recognize what&#8217;s going on. The sooner you are aware of your condition, the more capable you are of doing something.</p>
<p>So what is the root cause of your problem? Too much work? Don&#8217;t you feel the rewards of your hard labor? Is there too much expected of you? There are just too many things going on. You may be happy with your work but are constantly battling with your colleagues. You can cope with issues if you see your job as akin to a relationship. Yet, breaking away from an important part of your life will still be difficult. Just trust in yourself and know that you will regain your balance in time. You need to know when to break free, because if you are the kind of person under constant pressure, no one will want to deal with you. The hallmark of burnout is when you become a negative person. You may begin to detach yourself from everything and rather than doing your very best, you try to get by with the bare minimum. The ultimate one-two punch of complete exhaustion ends in inefficiency.</p>

<p>Simply acknowledging burnout can mark a turning point. Insight changes everything because once you see what&#8217;s happening, you can&#8217;t continue to approach things in the same way. If you realize you need to make a change, you find a way to do it. The realization, however, is much harder than the concrete steps you will have to take soon thereafter. How do you deal with burnout? Make time for yourself first. You need to meet your own needs by putting yourself ahead of everyone else. When there is chaos in your mind, you need to find methods of calming yourself. Do whatever works for you, be it exercise or a simple walk in the park, you need to practice it every day and draw on the experience all throughout your day.</p>
<p>Analyze the things you treasure the most. Once you&#8217;ve identified the unwanted aspects in your life, find specific strategies to resolve your problem. Remember, nobody is perfect. Never expect too much of yourself and learn to be happy with less than perfect. Accept that there are things you need to set aside and delegate when you can. The point is, you need to take care of yourself. Eat healthy and cultivate some form of support network. Find a friend you can run to when things just become too difficult to handle. Humans aren&#8217;t built for isolation. Plan for a brighter future, one that has limits and has all the support from your loved ones.</p>

<p>By creating the optimal schedule, I give myself more quality time to enjoy each moment of every day. When I take the time to breathe deeply and feel the breath traveling through my body, I am recharged.</p>
<p>The time with my family is precious to me. I cherish every moment I am with them and use our time together to strengthen our relationship through love, gratitude, and support.</p>
<p>I refuse to over-schedule myself or allow myself to become too busy in life. By balancing my time, I can give attention to myself and relax. I am better able to focus on each area of my life and give everything my very best.</p>
<p><strong>When I balance my time effectively, my work improves, my family is respected, and I feel happier and healthier.</strong></p>
<p>In my schedule, I include time for self-reflection. This enables me to grow and improve. I also give a high priority to me time and relaxation in my daily plan. My life is richer because of the quality time I give myself.</p>
<p>I give myself this time because I am worth it and everything in my life is made better when I am good to myself.</p>
<p>Today, I focus on creating a schedule that is right for me. Self-reflection and relaxation are priorities in my life so I can have leisure time to spend with my loved ones. I intend to enjoy my day fully and truly experience each moment.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-Reflection Questions</span>:</p>
<p>1.    Have I created me time in my schedule?<br />
2.    How do I typically over-extend myself?<br />
3.    Have I taken the time to sit back and enjoy the day?</p>

<p>If you constantly have to tighten your belt, a little extra money can absolutely buy happiness. But once you&#8217;ve achieved life&#8217;s basic comforts and necessities, more money doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean more happiness. You can finally get that piece of jewelry you&#8217;ve been eyeing for months, but that will only put a short-lived smile on your face. So can money really buy happiness? Not at all. The irony is that, while money is responsible for only a small piece of your overall happiness, it can also rob you of it entirely. Chasing after fame and fortune in the belief that it will make you happy can cost you the opportunity to truly focus on the important things in life.</p>
<p>The reality about money is that the more control you have over your finances, the less stressed you are, and this means that you are also more contented with your life. Of course, there are also things that are beyond our control. The stock markets crash and while you cannot control these, you can control how much you invest.</p>
<p>You need to come up with some form of system that you understand, so that you know where your money goes at all times. In order to live happily, you have to keep the various areas of your life in balance. Pare down your piles of paper and get rid of useless receipts. Set up a simple filing system and toss out junk. Pay your bills as they come rather than stockpiling them until month end. This makes you feel more in control of your expenses rather than setting aside a chunk of your time balancing all the bills. You won&#8217;t feel too much of the drudgery because you won&#8217;t see all that money fly out the door.</p>
<p>If you have trouble living within your means, you need to understand that there are specific items sabotaging your precious savings. Once you&#8217;ve identified the things you can save up on, you can make the necessary adjustments. There are many details that when added up, amount to a whole lot. Spending no more than what you can afford is absolutely essential to financial control. Credit card debts, in particular, are a different kind of animal. You will not be able take ownership of the rest of your financial life unless you bring your relationship with your creditors under control. Moreover, you can reap the psychological rewards that come with this move. If you&#8217;ve borrowed so much that you have trouble making the payments on a monthly basis, stop spending and borrowing. It&#8217;s as simple as that!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be consumed with the desire to have more. Save your money by setting aside a percentage of your paycheck. Deposit it in a bank before you are tempted to spend them. Budgeting and tracking expenses all translate into better savings. Moreover, you must remember that wanting doesn&#8217;t breed contentment. In fact, it just breeds more wanting. The point is to never give the control of your life to money. Plus, control doesn&#8217;t revolve around how much money you make. It hinges on how you handle the money you have.</p>

<p>You love to clear your house from clutter, but you just can&#8217;t do the same for your thoughts. You&#8217;re consumed with all the what-ifs and it keeps you awake all through the night. Rather than stressing about it, find ways to rid yourself of the mental clutter. It&#8217;s actually easier than you think. It requires a bit of effort in the beginning, but you&#8217;ll benefit from it. Organizing your life is very much like organizing your closet. You want to put things you value most in a place where you see it clearly. This allows you to make more room for good things to happen. Look at your priorities and make a list. This ensures that you don&#8217;t get sidetracked with little things. This method gets you to meet your weekly goals in a timely manner. Learn to set boundaries as well. Learn to say no when people ask you to do things. Yes, it&#8217;s never easy to turn someone down, but this is still better than disappointing them in the end. </p>
<p>Learn to re-label your emotions as well because these can be messy of you let them rule your life. But even the most difficult ones can at times nudge you towards the right direction. Emotions, even the negative ones, aren&#8217;t always bad for you. They give you useful signals about your needs, desires, and goals, and how you&#8217;re doing in relation to them. Think of it as a story and look at the message behind the feeling. It may be time to reevaluate your life. Get in touch with the inner you and be proud of your achievements. You may not like yourself all the time, but you do have achievements you can be truly proud of. You grow up in the process and gain wisdom.</p>
<p>Nothing clutters up the present moment like worrying about the future. It helps to keep an eye on the big picture. That way, your problems don&#8217;t seem as big as they are. Ask yourself, will it affect your life to a point that everything will go downhill from there? The answer would usually be a no. Let it go then and try to plan a way to fix it. It may take time, but you&#8217;ll get there somehow. Knowing that things will eventually pass, trust in your abilities. Stack up on self-esteem. The word ëshould&#8217; can be deadly because it indicates what you should have done. But past is past, and there&#8217;s nothing you can do to change things that have happened. </p>
<p>Replace the negative words with the ones that leave you feeling empowered. See just how much better you&#8217;ll feel with the right kind of self-talk. Negative talk is a virus that causes your brain to slow down and eventually malfunction. Look into new opportunities and program your brain to listen to thoughts that can help you create a better future. Daily affirmations help boost your confidence and increase your feeling of worthiness. As long as you&#8217;re doing the best that you can, you can&#8217;t beat yourself up too often. Moreover, the opinions you should listen to first are yours. When you constantly think about how others feel, you weigh yourself down. The trick is to keep all the emotions in check, especially the toxic ones. Open your heart and mind to lasting joy instead.</p>

<p>Money can&#8217;t buy happiness. Yes, it&#8217;s one of the oldest and most enduring clich&#8217;s. Yes, we all know what this means. It simply tells us that what we value most in life are things we can&#8217;t purchase from a store. After all, where can we get friendship, health, and happiness? These things come to our life when we take care of ourselves and the friends that we have. But people nowadays believe that, contrary to popular belief, money can get you happiness. You just have to know where to spend it. And the bright news in these gloomy economic times is that joy can be affordable on any budget.</p>
<p>It has now become apparent that we should nurture the things that we value. When we see the things that we love most last throughout the years, we know we&#8217;ve made the right choices. We also constantly have to work on improving the quality of our life. The point is to keep changing and growing. It&#8217;s not that what we have will perpetually grow old on us. We simply have to want more so that we feel more worthy. Life is all about exploring new territories and finding that we need to adjust to the changes that happen around. It&#8217;s not that retail therapy doesn&#8217;t help, but in order to get more bliss from our cash, we need to be more thoughtful about what we spend it on.</p>
<p><strong>One of the best ways to invest in happiness is to shift our attention to doing rather than owning. </strong>Our fondest memories aren&#8217;t on things that we bought. Instead, it was on what we did. It was that trip we had with the family or the night out spent with friends. None of these involve shopping. It&#8217;s not only that those things are fine while doing them; it&#8217;s more because when it&#8217;s over, they morph into sweet memories that we will always cherish. We hang on to that view of the ocean and how fun it was spending the day laughing. Our minds wash away the painful past, and what remains are memories that grow even better and brighter. We get a fresh dose of joy every time we revisit that cozy corner in our minds.</p>
<p>The point is not to waste our money on constantly buying something that makes us momentarily happy. Material things quickly lose their luster. Of course, there are some experiences that require us to shell out cash. We can&#8217;t travel the world without first purchasing a plane ticket. If it&#8217;s our soul that&#8217;s urging us to dole out the cash, then we must go ahead and do so. While saving up, we must learn to appreciate the simple things in life. It&#8217;s those mini treats that make the wait more bearable. In these difficult times, we need to be wiser about how we spend. The experience will overshadow the cost of the items we bought. Moreover, we also need to learn the value of giving. By sharing our blessings with others, we enhance the relationships that we have. Sometimes, giving will give us a feeling that is like no other. After all, it&#8217;s these unique experiences that stick to our minds in the years to come.</p>

<p>To the overly shy people out there, the idea of talking to new faces will make you extremely nervous. Just thinking about it makes your stomach churn. Shyness that becomes so severe interferes significantly with your social activities. Millions of people suffer symptoms of a disorder known as social anxiety at some point in their lives. The treatment for this is most often cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<p>In fact, scientists used to think that a child&#8217;s family environment largely dictated their emotional development as an adult. It appears as if nature has prewired some children for shyness. Many of them out grow it, but the unfortunate few suffer from it even in old age. The kind of world we live in may also contribute to it because there is less face-to-face contact required in daily life. The cyberspace generation that is accustomed to emails and computer games is at risk in the development of their social skills. While some people choose to work on it, there are things that you can do should you suffer from the same dilemma.</p>
<p>First, you need to identify your triggers. Not everyone is shy in every situation. When do you feel anxious? You need to ask yourself how you feel beforehand. Do you automatically make negative predictions? But instead of believing that the negative assumptions you make are facts, you have to challenge the way you think and process things. Shy people must begin to realize that their thoughts are just guesses. Try not to focus on the information that confirms your anxious beliefs. Shift your attention to the information that disproves it. Remember, you just can&#8217;t please everybody all the time.</p>
<p>Jump right in and find the guts to put yourself out there. Exposure is the most critical step because you are putting yourself intentionally in situations that somehow make you feel uncomfortable. The idea is to face your fears repeatedly until the anxiety loses intensity and eventually fades away. Your goal is to actively attract what you fear most to find that it&#8217;s really not a big deal. Though you may still get butterflies in your stomach, it is necessary that you do this as soon as possible. Delaying it only lengthens your torture.</p>
<p>Shyness is considered a personality trait and not a psychological condition or disorder. It has varying degrees. While most people feel nervous when asked to stand in front of an audience, some are just too much that they live like hermits. That&#8217;s not the way to live. For them, shyness is a cocoon. It&#8217;s safe, warm, and quiet. But it can also be confining, dark, and lonely.</p>
<p>Seek the help you need and ask the support of family and friends. They will always be there to give you pointers during these extremely difficult situations. When you know that you have someone to back you up, it somehow makes things better and easier to handle. Pretty soon, you&#8217;ll see that you are slowly overcoming your fears. Once you&#8217;ve gained a social life, you&#8217;ll see how much easier it is to put yourself out there and meet new faces.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve all heard of the word affirmation. It seems as if this has been repeated quite more often these days. These are basically positive phrases that are meant to train our minds to visualize and project what we all would want to happen. We need to look into that possible future with optimism because this will somehow come through when we make it a habit. When it is placed side by side with the law of attraction, it is the practice of positive thinking. To put it simply, we must claim our dreams and believe that we are on the way to achieving them.</p>
<p>Our minds work in ways we are always not aware of. Some of these processes overpass the conscious and head straight into the subconscious portion of our brains. The events that occur deep within our brain help us grow if we learn to always look at the positive side of things. We must be careful how we use our mind because it is such a powerful tool. If we are constantly negative about the things that happen to us, this thought process can work against us. What works are continuous affirmations about the things we go through. Simply put, we need to feed our minds by constant thoughts.</p>
<p>What people don&#8217;t grasp is that affirmations actually do work. Our minds were built to listen us. If we realistically think about the future, we feel happier because we think about the bright future that we can actually have. Negativity requires more work because we are asking our minds to gather our wits about and settle. If you&#8217;ve noticed, people who are more positive tend to have greater success. Because we forget what we don&#8217;t think about, we need to continually encourage ourselves as we achieve our dreams one step at a time.</p>
<p>We have the power to change the direction of our lives. We can control where we&#8217;re heading if we let only happy thoughts control us. Studies have shown that affirmative beliefs help us achieve what we want. Athletes, for instance, are constantly asked to focus on their skills and hone in on their bright future.  It is the only way to win. When we make that decision to become our very best cheerleader, we will also be challenging our unfavorable experiences. So why hasn&#8217;t it worked for some? It is because they move on if they don&#8217;t immediately see the results. Some things simply need time to happen.</p>
<p>For things to work, we&#8217;ll have to consign ourselves to our plan and do our damndest to see through it long and often enough. If we need to repeat our goals several times a day, we need to make sure that we do so. We can&#8217;t phrase things with a negative word because this would mean that our focus is on the sadder part of life. If we give up, it&#8217;s all too easy to slip back into the negative frame of mind. The point is, we are probably using these affirmations without us knowing about it. We just need to make sure the message we are telling ourselves is what we really and truly want to hear. And unless we put our heart and soul into it, they will not work. By involving ourselves deeply into it, we will crave for ways that help our better efforts.</p>

<p>When work just gets too much to handle, you may need time to get away from it all. Usually, vacations entail some form of spending, and this can be tough especially when you&#8217;re strapped for cash. A good alternative while waiting for your savings to bulge up a bit would be to take a mental mini break. This may sound like a limp substitute for an exotic getaway, but that is far from the truth. Frequent mind rests are absolutely essential for restoring your well-being. These are small ways you need to do if you want to stay sane. Stress can never be avoided. This becomes a part in the lives of the working class. If you want to survive and thrive, you need to find ways to help yourself.</p>
<p>Allow yourself to let go. You&#8217;re usually so busy trying to respond to the needs of your bosses and colleagues. You need to give yourself some time alone, and that would be perfectly reasonable. Give yourself permission to take just five minutes in quiet spot where you can recharge your energy. Think of these few minutes of time for you as a deposit in your emotional well-being bank. Everyone will benefit if you do this. When you sit back down on your desk, you&#8217;ll see that you are actually once again able to go back to work.</p>
<p>Turn off distractions whenever possible. It&#8217;s become normal in all of you to multi-task, juggling multiple schedules and communications devices. In fact, many of you will claim that were born to multi-task. But you&#8217;re not truly giving your mind time to rest if every ding from your cellular phone yanks you back to reality. Walk away from technology (or at least mute them). This may sound hard, but you really want to stay sane, you need to do this. This does not mean that you&#8217;re completely cutting ties with the rest of the world. It&#8217;s only a few minutes. Turn them back on once you&#8217;ve come back from that break. Just learn to revel in the moments of complete inaccessibility and take this time to think of nothing but good thoughts.</p>
<p>Surrender yourself to your senses. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a setting that makes you smile. It could be in a beach, the mountains, or maybe in a cafe somewhere else. Once you see the scene, try to smell, feel, and hear it. If you are in an island, listen to waves crashing to the shore or feel the warmth of the sun bathing your face. Whatever it is, think of nature. The more fully you create that scene in your mind, the more you&#8217;ll be able to ignore the distractions around you and tap into your inner peace and calm.</p>
<p>Mental vacations have far long been underrated. It does you a lot of good when you learn to harness the power within you. In fact, you may look forward to these breaks once you&#8217;ve made it into a habit. Try to learn this skill because it will benefit you in the long run.</p>

<p>Whether you want to set goals for your business or your personal life, defining clear, concise goals is very important. Without clear goals you can end up confused about what you want to achieve, and you may be putting yourself on the path to stagnation. Clear goals can give you tremendous momentum and intense purpose in your life.</p>
<p>Here are five important tips to help you to define clear goals in your life:</p>
<p>1. Understand what you want to achieve. In order to define clear goals, your first step is to determine exactly what you want to achieve. If you don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re going, you can&#8217;t figure out a route to get there.</p>
<p>Once you know where you want to be and what you want to achieve, you&#8217;ll be able to come up with the goals that will help you get there.</p>
<p>* Where do you see yourself in 5 years?<br />
* Take the time to sit down and brainstorm your long-term dreams and desires.</p>
<p>2. Determine a timeline. Setting timelines will prevent procrastination and spur you on to action to meet your goals. Having a timeline for your goals also helps to clarify them because now you know what you want and when you want it!</p>
<p>* Come up with goals that you want to meet in a month, year, and even five or ten years from now.</p>
<p>* Make a plan that will keep you on track; however, don&#8217;t etch your plan in stone! Allow for changes along the way, but keep your eye on the main goal.</p>
<p>3. Ensure your goals are realistic. With realistic goals, you can almost guarantee that you&#8217;ll be able to achieve them, and you won&#8217;t stress yourself out trying to accomplish something that&#8217;s out of reach. A clear goal is a realistic one.</p>
<p>* Break your long-term goals into small, achievable action steps. Reaching multiple goals along your journey will give you a feeling of accomplishment and motivate you to continue.</p>
<p>4. Be specific. Clarify your goals with the details of exactly what you want. Avoid vague generalities. When you make a specific goal, you&#8217;ll be better able to accomplish it.</p>
<p>* Specific goals allow you to form your timeline and define your action steps. There&#8217;s no guesswork involved when dealing with specifics.</p>
<p>* For example, &#8220;make more money with your business&#8221; is a vague goal. Come up with a specific goal, such as, &#8220;I will make $1,000 more per month, three months from today.&#8221; This goal is specific, measurable, and realistic.</p>
<p>5. Refine your goals. Your goals may change as your life changes. During this process, you&#8217;ll be able to make them more specific, realistic, and achievable.</p>
<p>* It&#8217;s okay to refine your goals several times in your life! What&#8217;s important now, might not be important to you six months or six years from now. Be willing to accept change. Revisit your goals from time to time and make new plans if necessary.</p>
<p>Some people flounder through life, unsure of their purpose or what they want to achieve. Don&#8217;t let this be you! Your life will have clear meaning if you put some thought into what&#8217;s important to you, what goals you want to achieve, and what actions to take to make your dreams a reality.</p>

<p>One of the greatest gifts you can give yourself is learning to master the art of self-discipline. Learning how to tell yourself no is an important step to become a stronger, wiser and more mature person.</p>
<p>While practicing self-discipline isn&#8217;t easy, there are many benefits to mastering this art of personal control:</p>
<p>* Self-discipline can help you achieve your goals and realize your dreams. Many times, achieving the goals you set for yourself requires you to sacrifice time, money and energy you might prefer to spend on other things. Are you willing to have this dedication?</p>
<p>* Self-discipline helps you get more done. By cutting out time wasters in your day, you can accomplish more every day and reach your goal sooner. Without the self-discipline to stick to a task, you can be easily distracted by less important details. Are you willing to remove these distractions?</p>
<p>* Self-discipline helps you have greater focus. By shutting out the things that take you away from your work, you can focus on what is most important. You can&#8217;t say yes to everything and everyone; you must be able to focus on one thing at a time and do it well.</p>
<p>Focus is nearly impossible to achieve without self-discipline, and goals are nearly impossible to achieve without focus. Are you willing to focus intensely on your goals?</p>
<p>The keys to self-discipline are simple. If you make a commitment to someone, keep it. If you make a commitment to yourself, guard it with your life!</p>
<p>* If you break a commitment to yourself, remember that you are human. You need to prioritize your commitments to yourself in the same way you prioritize other people&#8217;s needs.</p>
<p>Part of self-discipline is self-respect. In order to live the life you truly desire, you need to care for yourself properly.</p>
<p>Respect every part of yourself:</p>
<p>1. Respect your body. Pay attention to the signals your body sends you. We&#8217;re masterfully created, and your body will tell you when something is out of balance. Listen to the signals and treat yourself with VIP handling to be the strongest and most productive you can be!</p>
<p>* Consider adding exercise or yoga to your daily routine to help you achieve balance in your body and mind.</p>
<p>2. Nurture your mind by filling it with positive, engaging information.</p>
<p>* Read books for the sheer joy of learning.<br />
* Engage in meaningful discussions with people of all backgrounds and philosophies.<br />
* Avoid negative people and conversations.<br />
* Listen to joyful, uplifting music instead of letting the television flood your mind with commercialism and negativity.</p>
<p>3. Respect the spiritual part of yourself. It&#8217;s important to feel connected to something larger than you are. Connect with your Creator by meditating, praying or spending time in nature.</p>
<p>* Attend worship services at a local church, if that&#8217;s part of your belief system.<br />
* Allow the spiritual side of yourself to become stronger and more important to you.<br />
* Base decisions on the greater good rather than simply what feels good at the time.</p>
<p>4. Respect your physical health. Taking good care of your health requires self-discipline. Your body will help you accomplish amazing things if you treat it properly!</p>
<p>* Eat a healthy diet.<br />
* Get plenty of rest and exercise.<br />
* Strive to maintain a healthy weight.<br />
* Refuse to smoke.<br />
* Avoid over indulging in caffeine or alcohol.</p>
<p>5. Respect your time. This includes your work time, family time, playtime and personal time. Make space in your life for every area. Schedule family time and alone time just as you do work time and other obligations.</p>
<p>* By adding everything to your written agenda, you create a priority within yourself and self-discipline helps you stick to your priorities.</p>
<p>If you want to live your life to the fullest and achieve your goals, self-discipline is a must. Learning how to control your impulses and make strong decisions is one of the best things you can do for yourself. Self-discipline can bring you the life you always wanted.</p>

<p>Do you feel like something is missing in your life? Learning to focus on you, instead of others, may be the key you&#8217;ve been seeking!</p>
<p>If you find that you&#8217;re comparing yourself to others and coming up short, it&#8217;s time to stop that destructive habit. Comparisons get you nowhere. Rather than leading to positive improvements, they only cause you pain and discontent.</p>
<p>A better choice is to focus on your own personal needs and wants. You&#8217;re a unique individual who requires a personal approach! This helps you boost your self-image because you&#8217;re focused on improving yourself and not trying to beat someone else in some uncharted race.</p>
<p>Learning to focus on you rather than everyone else around you can be a difficult task. Too often, we&#8217;re so used to focusing on our families and friends that we don&#8217;t even know how to begin the process of focusing on our own choices and decisions that determine our lives.</p>
<p>Follow these five tips to help you focus on fully enjoying your life:</p>
<p>1. Devote one hour a day to &#8220;me time.&#8221; During this time, focus completely on yourself and the things you need or desire to feel strong, lovable and important. Reflect on what&#8217;s important to you. Dream big dreams and figure out small steps you can take to achieve them.</p>
<p>* Your  &#8220;me-time&#8221; can be anything you like it to be: take a relaxing bubble bath, go for a walk, take a nap, get a manicure, read a novel, or do something else. Anything that brings you pleasure simply for the sake of pleasure qualifies as me-time.</p>
<p>2. Take care of your own physical, spiritual and health needs. Relying on someone else to meet your needs only leads to dependence and resentment. Don&#8217;t wait for someone else to do these things for you.</p>
<p>* You have the power within you to meet your own needs and the only way you can be truly whole is to do just that.</p>
<p>3. Feed you mind and body good healthy fuels. You cannot expect your mind and body to function at their best if you don&#8217;t provide them with the fuels they need to work at full capacity.</p>
<p>* Feed your body good foods: fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Drink plenty of water to keep your body fully hydrated.</p>
<p>* Feed your mind by reading informative, well-written books, newspapers, and magazines. Choose recreational reading that builds your mind and spirit. Limit your TV watching and spend your time pursuing things that stimulate your thinking instead.</p>
<p>* Play board games rather than video games. Listen to music designed to stimulate your brain waves with binary beats.</p>
<p>4. Spend time each day doing something you love. No matter what your hobby is, it&#8217;s healthy to indulge in a creative pastime.</p>
<p>* Gardening, painting, woodcarving and pottery are all hobbies that encourage your creativity while you use your hands to create something beautiful.</p>
<p>5. Start a gratitude journal. Begin and end each day by listing five unique things you&#8217;re grateful for in your life. Before long, you&#8217;ll find that you spend more of your time dwelling on all the good things you have in the world rather than negative obstacles you might face.</p>
<p>Focusing on you helps you take the best possible care of yourself. It allows you to replenish your batteries and regain your strength so you can be fully present and engaged in the rest of your day. Use these tips to start changing your focus today, and have many happy tomorrows!</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is NLP?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you heard about Neuro Linguistic Programming, or NLP? It&amp;#8217;s an incredibly useful behavioral science that can help you change your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developed in the 1970s, it combines techniques from neurology, computer science, and linguistics to help people achieve their potential. Here&amp;#8217;s what it is and how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>Have you heard about <a class="zem_slink" title="Neuro-linguistic programming" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming">Neuro Linguistic Programming</a>, or NLP? It&#8217;s an incredibly useful behavioral science that can help you change your life.</p>
<p>Developed in the 1970s, it combines techniques from neurology, computer science, and linguistics to help people achieve their potential. Here&#8217;s what it is and how it works.</p>
<p>NLP has been described as the science of excellence in humans and involves modeling the language structure and behavior of success people.</p>
<p>This means if you want to be a happy, successful person, you can&#8217;t go wrong by thinking, talking, and behaving the way happy, successful people do. And if you utilize NLP in your speech, you will be able to persuade and convince others with greater success, too!</p>
<p><strong>Basic NLP Principles</strong></p>
<p>There are many variants of NLP, so there is debate between some practitioners that others are doing it wrong. Even with these hot debates, though, the basic principles are the same, and all agree that it works to make your life more fulfilling.</p>
<p>The two biggest principles of NLP are that the map is not the territory, and that both life and mind are systemic processes. What do those principles mean? Let&#8217;s take a look at them and find out.</p>
<p>1. <a class="zem_slink" title="Map–territory relation" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation">The map is not the territory</a>. This means that, as people, we have no way to actually understand reality. Instead, we understand our perceptions of that reality, and those perceptions may be flawed.</p>
<p>We use our senses to create a map of what we believe is there. These maps are what determine our behavior, not reality itself. If your map is skewed, you&#8217;ll behave in ways that are skewed, too.</p>
<p>2. Life and mind are systemic processes. This means that the things going on inside your mind and body, and between you and your environment, can&#8217;t be isolated from one another. Trying to do so won&#8217;t result in success.</p>
<p>Every NLP technique you encounter is based on these principles. These NLP techniques can help us understand how our brains work, how we store information, and how to change our behaviors to ones that are more desirable.</p>
<p><strong>NLP Benefits</strong></p>
<p>Here are some specific ways that NLP can help you:</p>
<p>1. Career. NLP can help you be more effective in your career. It can build your skills in teamwork, personal development, coaching, leadership, sales, and productivity. No matter what it is, if there&#8217;s a potential for growth and human interaction is present, NLP can help.</p>
<p>2. Goal Achievement. You can use NLP to help you set and achieve goals, as long as those goals are intelligent, measurable, meaningful and achievable.</p>
<p>* For example, no program can guarantee you earn three million dollars in a month unless you already have logical means to draw this income.</p>
<p>However, this method could be the one you use to successfully strengthen your skills and interactions with others. It can change the way you think and speak, and motivate you to take appropriate actions to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>3. Mental Health. NLP can help you overcome mental and emotional disorders and phobias.</p>
<p>4. NLP can bring you a happier and more fulfilling life.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in learning how to make a change in your life, NLP could be the tool you&#8217;ve been looking for. Quite simply, NLP involves studying successful people and the steps they take to achieve such success. This success can come from any part of your life.</p>
<p>Overcoming phobias, learning how to speak with confidence in front of large groups, and learning how to have a loving personal relationship are all issues that can be helped with NLP techniques. Investigate your options with NLP; you&#8217;ll be surprised by the difference it can make in your life!</p>

<p>Affirmations are powerful tools you can use to help you live the life you&#8217;ve always dreamed of.</p>
<p>What are affirmations?</p>
<p>Well, they&#8217;re positive statements that you say out loud on a regular basis. The goal is to re-program your subconscious mind so you can remove any negative thoughts that prevent you from living your dreams.</p>
<p>Affirmations work by overwriting negative thoughts, which are stored in your subconscious, with positive ones.</p>
<p>The Benefits of Affirmations</p>
<p>We all have mental recordings repeating again and again in our mind. Most of them come from childhood and have been directing our actions for years. Unfortunately, many of these old recordings are constantly feeding our mind negative information.</p>
<p>These negative recordings don&#8217;t always come from direct statements from people, but they tend to be general theories we&#8217;ve come to believe about our situation or ourselves.</p>
<p>If our parents always cautioned us about strangers, for example, we may have the mindset that sees the world as a dangerous place. If we came from a family without much money, we may have limiting beliefs about our finances that prevent us from attaining or keeping wealth.</p>
<p>The good news is you can override these destructive messages using the power of affirmations! Affirmations can reinforce good behaviors and change ones that need changing. To make those changes, you need to create affirmations you can identify with so they can help you improve.</p>
<p>Keep these key points in mind to create effective affirmations:</p>
<p>1. An affirmation must be in the present tense. Your subconscious doesn&#8217;t have the ability to accept a promise of future behavior. &#8220;I will eat healthy foods&#8221; doesn&#8217;t give your subconscious a timeline or deadline to perform your promise to yourself.</p>
<p>* Instead, state your affirmation as though it&#8217;s a behavior you already exhibit. &#8220;I always make healthy food choices&#8221; is a present tense statement your subconscious can accept as a fact.</p>
<p>2. For affirmations to work properly, they must be stated in the first person. In other words, don&#8217;t create an affirmation saying, &#8220;You must eat healthy foods.&#8221; In order for your affirmation to matter to your subconscious, it must be personal and use the word &#8220;I.&#8221;</p>
<p>* &#8220;I will choose healthy foods every time I eat&#8221; is a personal statement your subconscious can apply to your own behavior.</p>
<p>3. Finally, an affirmation must be stated in a positive manner. &#8220;I must stop eating junk food&#8221; sends your mind a distorted message; it interprets the same as &#8220;I eat junk food.&#8221; This type of statement will lead you in the opposite direction of your goal!</p>
<p>* Instead, &#8220;I choose fresh, healthy snacks when I am hungry&#8221; is a positive statement telling your mind the exact desired behavior.</p>
<p>How To Use Affirmations</p>
<p>Begin using affirmations by choosing a few short, clear statements about the things you&#8217;d like to see happen in your life.</p>
<p>Try some of these:</p>
<p>* I enjoy exercising every day.<br />
* I love eating nutritious fresh foods in healthy portions.<br />
* When I am free from the desire to smoke, I breathe clean, fresh air.<br />
* I have everything I need to be content and happy today.</p>
<p>You can write your affirmations on note cards and keep them with you in your purse or wallet. Whenever you have a few moments to spare, take them out and read them aloud.</p>
<p>State the affirmations in a clear, firm voice with a smile on your face as you say them. This will help you become more aware of the positive vibrations of the affirmations, allowing them easier access to your subconscious mind.</p>
<p>Using affirmations on a daily basis is a terrific way to boost the positives in your life. Start using this powerful tool today to bring the changes you most desire into your world.</p>

<p>Do you fall into the trap of wasting time? Time is a valuable commodity! When you waste your precious time, you&#8217;re actually preventing yourself from achieving the things you desire.</p>
<p>Below is a list of the top ten time wasters. If you find yourself spending too much time on these activities, try changing some of your habits so your time can be more productive and rewarding.</p>
<p>1. Wasting Your Worry. Many people will worry until doomsday about every little thing in their lives. This is simply unproductive and bad for your health, mind, and spirit.</p>
<p>* If you have something worrisome coming up, craft a plan of positive action on paper, then let it go. After all, worrying doesn&#8217;t accomplish anything positive.</p>
<p>2. Television. We&#8217;re a couch potato society! We schedule our lives around our favorite television shows and we spend less time doing more important activities like attending social events that could strengthen our relationships.</p>
<p>* Record your favorite TV shows and watch them during your leisure time, or limit your TV intake to just a couple hours a week.</p>
<p>3. Video and Computer Games. This is becoming such a time waster that gamers are actually developing what is called &#8220;gamers thumb,&#8221; a repetitive stress injury.</p>
<p>* Set time limits for yourself and your kids and help your kids understand why this is important.</p>
<p>4. Internet time. Are you constantly browsing the Internet, Facebook or Twitter? Are your kids hearing you say, &#8220;In a minute,&#8221; much too often when they ask you to spend time with them?</p>
<p>* Keep your time on the Internet short and get involved in life. Instead of chatting with your online friends, spend more time with your real-life friends and family!</p>
<p>5. Telephone Chatter. Sure, we like to call old friends and chat, but do you chat on the phone all day long? If you do, you may find that you get hardly anything done all day.</p>
<p>* Keep phone calls to a minimum or set a timer to go off after 15 minutes. This way you won&#8217;t feel deprived of a good conversation, but it won&#8217;t take over your whole day.</p>
<p>6. Traffic and Commuting. Some of us spend an enormous amount of time traveling to and from work. You can turn your commuting time into productive time!</p>
<p>* Try carpooling or taking the bus, subway or train to work. You can use this time to read, plan your day, complete paperwork, or even relax your mind before a productive day.<br />
* If you drive, you can listen to inspiring and informative CDs or tapes to sharpen your mind each morning.</p>
<p>7. Hobbies. Yes, there are people who are so obsessed with a hobby that they don&#8217;t make time to do anything else. They rush home from work to their hobby, even skipping dinner.</p>
<p>* If this is you, schedule your hobby time so you&#8217;re not skipping meals, missing time with your family, or cutting into other productive time.</p>
<p>8. Daydreaming. It&#8217;s fun and healthy to dream about career ambitions or future aspirations, but when those dreams prevent you from taking action in your life, then you&#8217;re wasting time. Avoid getting bogged down with too much dreaming.</p>
<p>* Make a list of your goals or dreams, then take action to make those dreams come true.</p>
<p>9. Meetings. Although necessary, meetings can be one of the biggest time wasters of our workday. If everyone is wiped out from sitting in long meetings all day, productive time will be low.</p>
<p>* If you&#8217;re in charge of meetings, set timeframes for them and stick to your stated time.<br />
* Limit the length of your meetings: keep needless chatter and agendas out of the meeting.</p>
<p>10. Planning. If you don&#8217;t take the time to plan your day, the important things you need to accomplish may not get done.</p>
<p>* Write down your daily goals and tasks.<br />
* Schedule your day in the order of your top priorities.</p>
<p>There are many ways we waste our time in our everyday lives, but with a little effort, you can avoid time-wasting activities and turn that time into an advantage.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="tweetmeme_button" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a href="http://api.tweetmeme.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftranquillityhub.com%2Fsimplify%2Flive-simply"><img src="http://api.tweetmeme.com/imagebutton.gif?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftranquillityhub.com%2Fsimplify%2Flive-simply" height="61" width="51" /></a></div><p>How to Live Simply</p>
<p>Confucius once said, &#8220;Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.&#8221;</p>
<p>If we make life complicated and fill it up with a bunch &#8220;stuff,&#8221; how can we ever focus on what matters most?</p>
<p>Many of us are running around trying to squeeze everything we can out of life when, in fact, we&#8217;d be a whole lot happier and healthier if we savored the beauty of simplicity!</p>
<p>Here are some tips you can use today to simplify your life:</p>
<p>1.    Clutter. When you eliminate the clutter around you, you&#8217;ll gain a deeper appreciation for the things are dearest to you.</p>
<p>*    Ask yourself: When was the last time I read the stack of books piled up on the floor? When did I last notice the details on one of those little trinkets I got while on vacation? When did I last wear the scarf lying on the closet floor? Give this stuff to someone who needs it!</p>
<p>*   De-cluttering will give you an opportunity to enjoy the things that truly matter to you. Plus you&#8217;ll feel a sense of relief with an organized working and living space.</p>
<p>2.    Food. Food is another aspect of your life that can be simplified in many ways. Instead of worrying about the next bite, enjoy the taste of the food that&#8217;s already in your mouth. Savor it. Let it all sink in and try to taste each flavor.</p>
<p>*    Also, consider the ingredients in your food. Take the time to use quality ingredients instead of processed or chemically enhanced foods. The end result will taste better, and your body and mind will thank you for the nourishment!</p>
<p>3.    Gadgets. Think of all the gizmos and gadgets in your life. Do you use them all? Do you even use half of them?</p>
<p>*   The more stuff we have to &#8220;connect&#8221; us, the more we become disconnected! Take the headphones out of your ears, turn off the car radio, and put down your cell phone. Instead of trying to be always connected, communicate with those around you. Nothing is more satisfying than a rewarding conversation or a family fun night!</p>
<p>4.    Thinking. A cluttered mind steers you away from what&#8217;s most important. The reality is that simple ideas are almost always better. By simplifying your thinking, you open your mind to new possibilities.</p>
<p>*   A simplified mind doesn&#8217;t mean you aren&#8217;t thinking, it just means that you&#8217;re choosing to focus on one thing with greater clarity.</p>
<p>*    When your attention is split in several directions, it&#8217;s awfully hard to make rational decisions. And if you&#8217;re dwelling in the past or worrying about the future, how can you live in the moment? Release distractions from your mind and you&#8217;ll not only feel better, but you&#8217;ll regain a sense of peace within you.</p>
<p>5.    Schedule. If you&#8217;re trying to jam a week into a single day, you&#8217;ll feel a tension that will tug you away from where you&#8217;re meant to be. Instead of wondering what&#8217;s next, savor the here and now.<br />
?    Eliminate some of the clutter in your hectic schedule and do what&#8217;s best for you and your family, not everyone else.</p>
<p>Living life simply is extremely rewarding. When you do so, you eliminate many of the useless cares and are able to focus on what&#8217;s really important to you. Give it a try!</p>

<p>If you have children, you know how hard it can be at times to get them to do the things they should. Between after school activities, video games, cell phones, and computers, convincing your kids to take care of their <a class="zem_slink" title="House work" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_work">household chores</a> and other responsibilities can be a real challenge.</p>
<p>The truth is, not every method of motivation will work with your child. Also, what works for one child may be detrimental to another!</p>
<p>*    As parents, it&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of wanting to be a friend to your child, but your goal is to be their leader, teacher, and motivator, too!</p>
<p>Here are a few things you can try to help motivate your kids to get things done:</p>
<p>1.    Kids love praise. Your kids want your attention and praise. If they know that doing the things they&#8217;re supposed to do will bring them praise, they&#8217;re more likely to do those things. You&#8217;re their parent and they want to make you proud of them.</p>
<p>*   By encouraging them and praising them frequently, you&#8217;re reinforcing good behavior.</p>
<p>2.    Offer rewards. Often, children are motivated by rewards. The rewards don&#8217;t have to be large or involve money. You can reward your children by:</p>
<p>*    Spending time with them doing an activity they enjoy<br />
*    Reading to them<br />
*    Playing games with them<br />
*    Curling up and watching a movie together</p>
<p>*    All of these rewards are positive motivators for your children. They&#8217;ll be much more eager to do their household chores if the reward is something they can look forward to.</p>
<p>3.    Lead by example. If your kids see you doing nothing all day long, they&#8217;ll feel as if it&#8217;s okay for them to do the same thing. Remember that your children are like a sponge and they look up to you and want to emulate you.</p>
<p>*    Show your kids that regular tasks can be rewarding. For example, seeing a bunch of separate ingredients transform into cookies that get compliments can give your child a confidence boost to help out again next time!</p>
<p>4.    Fear of consequences. There&#8217;s a big difference between consequences and punishment. When your children don&#8217;t do the things they&#8217;re supposed to do, you can teach them how their actions or inactions can have a negative impact on their lives and the lives of others.</p>
<p>*    Take something away for a short period and explain why you&#8217;re doing it and how they can earn it back. This example of natural and logical consequences is essential preparation for adult life.</p>
<p>5.    Show love. Your children need and want your love and devotion. Get involved in their lives. If your child is really interested in something, do it with them!</p>
<p>*    Showing children you appreciate them and respect their choices will build a deeper bond between you. When you ask them to get something done, they&#8217;ll be more likely to do it because of the mutual respect between you.</p>
<p>Motivating your children isn&#8217;t always easy. It takes dedication and consistency to provide the example and direction needed to build a child&#8217;s character.</p>
<p>While it may seem easier to throw in the towel and do things yourself, standing steadfast and finding new ways to motivate your kids is much more likely to help him become a productive, responsible adult.</p>
<p>As a parent, it&#8217;s your job to mold your children into caring, responsible and respectful adults. Remember, children are people too and are motivated by the same things that motivate anyone else.</p>
<p>Things like love, attention, pleasure, rewards and recognition top the list of things children crave in their lives. Heaping these essential motivators onto your children will provide great rewards throughout their lives.</p>

<p>Do you have a difficult time staying on task? If you feel as though you&#8217;re spending a whole day just trying to get started, while never actually getting anything done, you can do something about it!</p>
<p>There are some very simple ways to help you regain your focus and stay on task, no matter what the day brings. In fact, some of these strategies are so simple that you may question whether they really are effective. The truth is, the simplest of strategies often yields the greatest result.</p>
<p>Here are seven simple tips you can use to help you stay on task:</p>
<p>1.    Keep a list. Create a daily task list on paper for your whole day or week. If you think creating a list in your mind is just as effective, think again. The truth is, you&#8217;re more likely to waste precious time just trying to remember what&#8217;s ahead!<br />
*    When you take the time to create a list, you&#8217;re giving yourself a visual confirmation of what&#8217;s next. When you have a list to refer to, there&#8217;s no arguing what comes next and you won&#8217;t have any excuse to stray from your plan.</p>
<p>2.    Schedule time for meetings and events. Set up specific times when people can come in and interrupt your work. Let your co-workers know what works for you and strive to stick to it as much as possible.</p>
<p>*    For example, it&#8217;s often helpful if your co-workers know they need to leave you alone for two or three hours in the morning, but then after that they can come in and ask questions or get advice from you as needed.</p>
<p>3.    Refuse to check email every five seconds. If you interrupt your workday by checking your email too frequently, you can get side tracked just as you are building momentum. Set specific times when you check email. It could be twice a day, or every few hours, but the goal is to eliminate unnecessary distractions.<br />
*    You can also send an automated reply that explains when you check email and when the sender should expect a response. I&#8217;m sure people can wait a few hours for a response!</p>
<p>4.    Keep off of <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Facebook</a>, <a class="zem_slink" title="Twitter" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> and instant messaging services. Sure, communicating with your friends and colleagues can make the day go faster, but it distracts you from the task at hand and keeps you from building precious momentum.<br />
*    How can you possibly get anything done when you&#8217;re immersed in a real-time Twitter conversation? You can&#8217;t. So turn it off and go back on when it&#8217;s the right time for you.</p>
<p>5.    Use headphones to block out noise. If you have trouble focusing on your work because of the noise around you, wear a pair of noise-canceling headphones. If you don&#8217;t want any sound at all, get some earplugs; it&#8217;ll save your sanity!</p>
<p>6.    Get a comfortable chair. Did you know that productivity and comfort go hand-in-hand? It&#8217;s true. Having a comfortable chair makes a huge difference in how you think, feel, and perform. If a new chair is out of the budget, get one of those chair cushions. You&#8217;ll find that it&#8217;s a purchase that pays for itself.</p>
<p>7.    Clean up your workspace. When your desk is clean and organized, it&#8217;s much easier to stay focused on the task at hand. Why? Because you don&#8217;t have to wade through the stacks and clutter to find what you need.</p>
<p>*   Even seeing the piles of junk in your peripheral vision may increase your internal tension! Keep only what you need for your current task and put everything else in its place.</p>
<p>Do you think you can implement some of these simple tips in your workflow? I know you can!</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll experience a huge difference in your productivity and &#8211; more importantly &#8211; your happiness, when you apply even just a few of these time-saving techniques. You&#8217;ll be able to get more done faster than ever, leaving you with time for more important things, like having fun!</p>

<p>Distractions get in the way every day, keeping you from being as productive as you might like. These distractions come in many forms, from ringing doorbells and telephones, to emails and voicemails. It can be a real challenge to stay focused!</p>
<p>How do you go about disregarding all these disturbances to get any work done? It can be tough, but there are ways to reduce the interruptions.</p>
<p>Here are some strategies you can use to control your distractions:</p>
<p>1.    Telephone distractions. Unless you&#8217;re expecting an important call, turn off your ringers and direct your calls to voicemail. Then only check your voicemail once or twice a day.</p>
<p>?    Return the calls you must, but if you can reply via email, that&#8217;s even better. When you send an email reply, you can keep the conversation succinct.</p>
<p>2.    Email interruptions. Unsubscribe from email lists you don&#8217;t need and set up separate email accounts for business and pleasure. This way, when you&#8217;re trying to work, you don&#8217;t find yourself bombarded with jokes, videos, party invites, or <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> messages.</p>
<p>?    Reduce the frequency emails are delivered to your inbox or set your email so you only receive emails when you go in and manually retrieve them in batches.</p>
<p>3.    The World Wide Web time drain. If you don&#8217;t need the internet for your work, stay away from it. You&#8217;ll save yourself a lot of wasted time.</p>
<p>?    Fully close web browsers so you eliminate the temptation to surf online.</p>
<p>4.    Co-workers. If you find that co-workers annoy you, try wearing headphones while you work to give the illusion you can&#8217;t hear them. It might sound silly, but it eliminates being subjected to endless babble.</p>
<p>?    Another option is to post a Do Not Disturb sign outside of your workspace. Hopefully, your co-workers will know that you mean business and honor it.</p>
<p>5.    Work space clutter. Get rid of any visual clutter &#8211; it&#8217;s distracting and kills productivity. Seeing unfinished projects or pending work can cause unnecessary stress. This stress can have negative results, like making you unable to focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>?    Put everything you don&#8217;t need for your current project into a drawer or box out of sight if you have to. You can always sort it out carefully when you&#8217;re less busy.</p>
<p>?    The same should be said for computer clutter. Eliminate unneeded computer programs and icons to make your computer more efficient. The quicker you&#8217;re able to find the file you need, the faster you&#8217;ll be able to get back on track.</p>
<p>6.    Work-at-home distractions. If you work from home, make sure friends and family respect the fact that you&#8217;re truly working just like anyone who goes into an office. Some people may have a difficult time understanding this concept, but they&#8217;ll comply if you explain it.</p>
<p>?    Avoid doing household chores during your work time. Train your mind to think about these tasks when your work is finished.</p>
<p>When distractions do arise, whether at home or at the office, make notes and deal with them at an appropriate time at the end of the day. If someone pops by to chat, stand up to let them know your chatting time is limited. Don&#8217;t allow them to sit or get cozy.</p>
<p>Of course, you still need to set aside time to handle these distractions. You don&#8217;t want to be so restrictive on yourself that you burn out. After all, everyone benefits from a little guilt-free downtime! It&#8217;s okay to let your mind wander, browse the web, or do whatever appeals to you, just make sure it doesn&#8217;t creep into your work time.</p>
<p>Follow these tips every day to make effective use of your time and energy. When you eliminate distractions, you&#8217;ll find that you can get more done in half the time!</p>
