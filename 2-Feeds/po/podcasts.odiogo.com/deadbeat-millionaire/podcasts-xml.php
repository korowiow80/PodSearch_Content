<p>I thought I would give you an update now that the <strong>Deadbeat Millionaire</strong> has launched. I have read quite a few reviews about the Deadbeat Millionaire from customers and there was a common theme amongst some of them. Many customers were extremely haappy with the niche  and keyword suggestions provided in the program.</p>
<p>Many internet marketers, including me, find it difficult thinking of new niches and so getting niche and keyword ideas is fantastic.  The best news is that they will be sending out new niche ideas on a regular basis.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.deadbeatmillionaireblog.com/dbmb"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-110" title="Deadbeat millionaire" src="http://www.deadbeatmillionaireblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Deadbeat-millionaire.png" alt="Deadbeat millionaire Deadbeat Millionaire Overview" width="319" height="108" /></a></p>
<p>The <strong>Deadbeat Millionaire</strong> software is a new product from well-respected and successful internet marketer Dan Brock. This fantastic software automates the process of setting up high converting sites and getting buying traffic to those sites.</p>
<p>Dan’s first product in the Deadbeat Millionaire series was the Deadbeat Super Affiliate, which was a huge success, and it received high praise from customers. The Deadbeat Super Affiliate is a course about selling physical products on the internet using services like Amazon and other Brand Affiliate networks.  The <a title="Deadbeat Millionaire" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.deadbeatmillionaireblog.com/dbmb">Deadbeat Millionaire</a> takes this to the next level.</p>
<p>Dan&#8217;s software works with any affiliate program so you can use it for selling both physical and digital products or even your own products. I really like the fact that you can use it with physical products because there are huge advantages to selling physical products. Although, many Affiliate Marketers will tell you that the money lies in digital products, like those sold on Clickbank, physical products are often far less competitive which makes it easier to enter the market and therefore in many cases a far more viable option.  I personally make the majority of my money through selling physical products.</p>
<h2><strong>Benefits of The Deadbeat Millionaire</strong></h2>
<p>One aspect of the program that I am really excited about is that Dan shows you his own personal successful websites.  One of the greatest ways to be successful is to copy people who are successful.  So imagine having access to affiliate websites that make Dan money on a daily basis and being able to dissect how he created these websites.</p>
<p>Dan also picks niches and shows you how he would go about promoting them. He covers the keywords to use, where to get traffic and where to find backlinks.  He even provides articles based around those niches.</p>
<p>An additional feature of the <em>Deadbeat Millionaire</em> is that every month Dan provides information on possible niches to enter.  This means you can stay up to date with the current trends.</p>
<p>The <em>Deadbeat Millionaire</em> is a feature-packed software.  <a title="Deadbeat Millionaire" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.deadbeatmillionaireblog.com/dbmb"><strong>Click here to find out more about this extraordinary product</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-52" title="Deadbeat Millionaire" src="http://www.deadbeatmillionaireblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/lazyman-300x274.jpg" alt="lazyman 300x274 What is The Deadbeat Millionaire?" width="300" height="274" /></p>
<p><strong>The Deadbeat Millionaire</strong> is the latest product to be released by Dan Brock whose other products include Profitzon and The Deadbeat Super Affiliate.  The Deadbeat Super Affiliate received rave reviews from customers so I am really looking forward to seeing his latest product.</p>
<p>Now not much information has been released about the <a title="Deadbeat Millionaire" href="http://www.deadbeatmillionaireblog.com/dbmb">Deadbeat Millionaire</a> but it is going to be a software program and from what I understand it will be an accompaniment to the Deadbeat Super Affiliate by automating the processes to an extent. The Deadbeat Super Affiliate is a course based on Dan&#8217;s experience on how to be a successful affiliate with amazon and other brand networks.</p>
<h2>Why am I interested in The Deadbeat MIllionaire?</h2>
<p>The reason I like the idea of this product is because I have had most of my affiliate success on Amazon.  I prefer selling physical products instead of digital ones as they are usually easier to sell.  In addition amazon also has a fantastic reputation so conversions are usually higher than with other merchants and customers are cookied for 24 hours so if they buy anything within  24 hours after they have clicked through to amazon from your link you get a commission for it even if they do not buy the specific product you were advertising. In many cases they buy the product you were advertising and more products as well so you also get a commission for the additional products. The one major downfall with Amazon is that the commissions are quite low so either you have to sell high ticket items or large quantities of low cost items to make it viable.</p>
<p>I must admit that if i did not see the reviews The Deadbeat Super Affiliate received I would not be putting the blog together about <em>The Deadbeat Millionaire</em>.  The reason is I do not really like the branding of the deadbeat product.  It is made to seem that it is easy to make money on the internet and I can tell you from first hand experience it is HARD work.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong I have loved/love every minute of  it though:)</p>

Dan Brock is also known as &#8220;Dan The Internet Man&#8221; and has been working on the internet for many years.</p>
<p>Currently there are very few details released about the new program, <a title="Deadbeat Millionaire" href="http://www.deadbeatmillionaireblog.com/dbmb" rel="nofollow">The Deadbeat Millionaire</a>, but Dan&#8217;s other Deadbeat program the Deadbeat Super Affiliate was a huge success.  The Deadbeat Super Affiliate is a detailed program on how to sell physical products as an Affiliate with Amazon and other networks. The program is developed from Dan&#8217;s experiences and the personal success that he has achieved as an affiliate.</p>
<p>Based on the previous products released by Dan and his experience as an internet marketer I am looking forward to the release of his new product. I will  be putting together a <em>Deadbeat Millionaire Bonus</em> package for the readers of this blog that purchase the product through my link.</p>
<p>Be sure to bookmark this page so you can find it again when the product is launched.  I will be adding more information to this blog about the upcoming release of the Deadbeat Millionaire as it becomes available so make sure you check back regularly.</p>
