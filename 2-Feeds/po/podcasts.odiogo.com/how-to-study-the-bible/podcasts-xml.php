      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In your learning how to study the Bible, there are certain teachings, that will help you, if you know them before you study.</p>
<p>Not Too Hard To Cull A Number Of Non-Genuine Christian People</p>
<p>You and I like to be ruled by the Bible, not just read it.  Therefore we will have to know who, in our own life, isn’t a servant of Jesus Christ, and who is a follower of Jesus.  First, I’ll show to you an easy way to identify anybody, who may even regularly go to a church house, but who can&#8217;t be honestly considered to be a follower of Jesus.</p>
<p>Paul the Apostle of Jesus penned these words below in his letter to a man who was known as John:</p>
<p>1 John</p>
<p>2 ;22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Messiah? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son. </p>
<p>The words, “Christ” “Messiah”, and “Anointed” all have the same idea.  They refer to the practice of pouring oil on the head, of a fresh king or high priest.</p>
<p>In consideration of the above verse, if a person denies that Jesus is king and high priest, then they deny that Christ is identical with The Father, and they are not a follower of Jesus.  Likewise, if they deny that Christ is The Almighty, then they are not a follower of Jesus.  Those notions are implied by the above verse, from the Bible.</p>
<p> Means Of Spotting A Phony Followers Of Jesus</p>
<p>Lots of folks think that they are Christians, and many say that they love Christ Jesus, or that they have welcomed him into their heart.  However the Biblical verses, below, teach us that some of those people could not be Christian people, regardless of what they say about themselves.</p>
<p>In the following Bible’s verses, it is Christ himself speaking to us:</p>
<p>Matthew 7</p>
<p> 21 Not every person that speaks to me, Master, Master, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father who is in heaven. </p>
<p> 22 Many folks will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in your name accomplished many wonderful works?</p>
<p> 23 And then will I put forth unto them, I never knew you: go away from me, you lawless ones. </p>
<p>John 14</p>
<p> 21 He that hath my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he who loveth me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. </p>
<p> 23 … If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. </p>
<p> 24 He who doesn&#8217;t love me doesn&#8217;t keep my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father&#8217;s which sent me. </p>
<p>The verses from the Book of Isaiah, the prophet, below, make it obvious to us how anyone can be a worshipper of Christ, if they elect to be one, not just the descendants, of a man named Israel.  </p>
<p>A prophet is somebody who says what The Almighty told him to say.  So, in effect, it is The Heavenly Father speaking.  Remembering who isn’t or who is a worshipper of Christ, in your life, can be of help to you, when you are learning how to study the Bible</p>
<p>Isaiah 56</p>
<p> 2 Blessed is the man … that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil. </p>
<p> 3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, the LORD hath utterly separated me from his people…. </p>
<p>[“His people” = the children of a man named “Israel”]</p>
<p> 6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to Jahweh, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;</p>
<p>[“stranger” = not the descendants of a man named “Israel”]</p>
<p> 7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful ….</p>
<p> 8 The Lord Jahweh, which gathers the outcasts of Israel says, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</p>
<p>In the passage above, the word “Israel” means “the descendants of a man named ‘Israel’”.</p>
<p>The conclusion is, anyone can be a servant of Jesus Christ, if they choose to do the teachings of Christ Jesus, and his father, who are the same.  Part, of learning how to study the Bible, is how to know who isn’t or who is a Christian in your life.</p>
<p>How This Helps You</p>
<p>In many places in the Bible, we are told how to treat “unbelievers” and “the wicked”.  If you get to one of those places, and you don’t know how to tell which is which, then how will you be able to apply the holy scripture in your own life?</p>
<p>Before you go to the web&#8217;s site, in the next paragraph, be so kind, as to tell us your thoughts in the comment field. We want to read that, which you share!  Thank you!</p>

      <description>Bible study website Biblefixit.com has announced that it is now set to begin serving the internet&amp;#8217;s users.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bible study website Biblefixit.com has announced that it is now set to begin serving the internet&#8217;s users.  Up til now the website has &#8220;lain fallow&#8221;, declared the site&#8217;s owner, Pastor Red Baxter, while he, of necessity, attended to other matters.</p>
<p>The site&#8217;s expertise is imparting to all kinds of people <a href="http://biblefixit.com/how-to-study-the-bible.htm">how to study the bible</a>.  A first-time-ever fun learning method offered to scriptural learners is the site&#8217;s &#8220;Bible Trivia Contest&#8221;, wherein anyone is permitted to play, but modest donors can win a $100 cash prize, as a compensation for displaying their knowledge of <a href="http://howstudythebible.blog.com/feed/">bible facts</a>.</p>
<p>The donations, by players competing for the cash prize, are put to use to support the development of a network named the &#8220;Tru U. Bible Brotherhood&#8221;.  The network is referred to as the &#8220;Tru U.&#8221; for convenience.  The reason for the Tru U. is to organize scriptural studying sessions in homes, throughout the homeland.</p>
<p>Associates of the Tru U. Bible Brotherhood will learn to be scripturally knowledgeable advisors, in community centers called &#8220;Bible Fixit Hubs&#8221;.</p>
<p>Pastor Red Baxter is known as a presbyter, or elder, of the order of Paul.  To put it differently his credentials are from direct revelation, instead of from the seminaries of the world order, which have, in the last few centuries, gone astray, says Pastor Baxter.</p>
<p>The trivia competitions take place in an online chat room.  Questions are entered by the Biblefixit.com staff.  Whoever fastest keys the correct answer wins the point.  The competition is over, when one giver-contestant wins a 4-point margin beyond his leading competitor, who is also a giver.  The winner is sent their $100 prize without delay, just as the game is finished.</p>
<p>Biblefixit.com is a proactive presence on the web.  There is a page about destroying idols, and a web page on ways to identify the children of Ammon and Moab in our own present reality, and how the holy Bible says to treat them.  In addition to those web pages, there is also a web page about How To Study The Bible&#8221;.</p>
<p>Obviously, if you desire to check out the site for yourself, even play for free in the trivia contest, the URL is biblefixit.com .</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now that you want to know how to study the Bible, there are certain teachings, that will help you, if you know them before you study.</p>
<p>Not Too Hard To Identify Some Of Those, Who Are Not-Real Followers Of Jesus</p>
<p>We like to obey the Bible, not just read it.  Therefore we will have to know who, in our own life, isn’t a follower of Jesus, and who is a Christian person.  First, I’ll share with you an easy technique to spot somebody, who might even regularly go to a church house, however who is not a servant of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ penned the following words in his epistle to a disciple hight John:</p>
<p>1 John</p>
<p>2 ;22 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Messiah? He is antichrist, that denies the Father and the Son. </p>
<p>The words, “Christ” “Messiah”, and “Anointed” all carry the same idea.  They point to the practice of pouring oil atop the head, of a new king or high priest.</p>
<p>By the verse above, if anybody denies that Jesus is king and high priest, then they deny that he is God, and they are not a Christian.  Moreover, if they deny that Christ is The Almighty, then they are not a worshipper of Christ.  These ideas are implied by the Bible’s verse, above.</p>
<p>2nd Means Of Culling A Phony Christian Person</p>
<p>Great numbers of human beings avow that they are worshippers of Christ, and many say that they love Jesus, or that they have allowed him into their heart.  Nevertheless the Bible’s verses, following, teach us that some of those creatures might not be followers of Jesus, regardless of what they claim to be.</p>
<p>In the following Bible verses, it is Christ Jesus himself speaking:</p>
<p>Matthew 7</p>
<p> 21 Not every person that utters to me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he who doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven. </p>
<p> 22 Many souls will say to me in that day, Master, Master, haven&#8217;t we prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful doings?</p>
<p> 23 And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: leave from me, you lawless ones. </p>
<p>John 14</p>
<p> 21 He who hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is who loves me: and he that loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. </p>
<p> 23 … If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our dwelling with him. </p>
<p> 24 He that doesn&#8217;t love me doesn&#8217;t keep my sayings: and the saying which ye hear is not mine, but the Father&#8217;s who sent me. </p>
<p>The verses from the Book of Isaiah, the prophet, below, make it obvious to us how anybody can be a worshipper of Christ, if they make up their mind to be one, not just the house, of a man named Israel.  </p>
<p>A prophet is somebody who says what God told him to say.  So, in effect, it is God speaking.  Remembering who isn’t or who is a worshipper of Christ, in your life, can be of help to you, when you are learning how to study the Bible</p>
<p>Isaiah 56</p>
<p> 2 Blessed is the man … that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and keeps his hand from doing any evil. </p>
<p> 3 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, Jahweh hath utterly separated me from his people…. </p>
<p>[“His people” = the children of a man named “Israel”]</p>
<p> 6 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of Jahweh, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;</p>
<p>[“stranger” = not the children of a man named “Israel”]</p>
<p> 7 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful ….</p>
<p> 8 The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel says, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered unto him.</p>
<p>In the passage above, the word “Israel” means “the children of a man named ‘Israel’”.</p>
<p>The conclusion is, anybody can be a Christian person, if they choose to follow the words of Jesus, and his father, who are one in the same being.  Part, of learning how to study the Bible, is how to know who isn’t or who is a follower of Jesus in your life.</p>
<p>How This Helps You</p>
<p>In many places in the Bible, we are told how to treat “unbelievers” and “the wicked”.  If you get to one of those places, and you don’t know how to tell which is which, then how will you be able to apply the holy scripture in your own life?</p>
