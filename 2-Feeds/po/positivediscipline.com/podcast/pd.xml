	<title>Focusing on Solutions #47 (Positive Time-Out - You First)</title>
	<description>Create a positive time out plan for yourself. It could be a soak in the tub, getting in the shower (where kids can’t follow), going into the bathroom, locking the door, and turning on the stereo, taking a short walk (if your kids are old enough), sitting on the floor in the lotus position and chanting, whatever works for you. Let your kids know your plan and that you will use it when you need to calm down. Be sure they know this is "for" you, not "against" them.
