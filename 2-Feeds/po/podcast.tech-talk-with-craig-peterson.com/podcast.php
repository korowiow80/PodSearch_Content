    <description>&lt;p&gt;Jon Grodem the Sr. Director of Product and Marketing at Optoma joins Craig at CES to discuss DLP&amp;reg; projectors. With mobile devices (iPods, smart phones, tablets, gaming devices, etc) having taken the world by storm, Optoma has led the charge in developing personal, mobile and portable projectors to complement this movement. At CES, Optoma will unveil two new projectors, both of which offer connectivity to almost all mobile devices.  The PK320 is a 100-lumen, 8 oz., pocket-sized Pico projector that can project widescreen images up to 150&amp;#8221; It not only connects to any device, (computers, tablets, smart phones, gaming consoles, or digital cameras and camcorders), but it also has a microSD card slot (up to 32GB) and on-board Office Viewer software that allow users to see Microsoft Office files (word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.), as well as most common image formats, in their native form without the need for PC.  Otoma&amp;#8217;s all new ML300 represents the company&amp;#8217;s second offering in the &amp;#8220;mobile&amp;#8221; projector category. At 1.4 lbs and measuring a sleek 7.2&amp;rdquo; x 1.8&amp;rdquo; x 4.4&amp;rdquo;, it fits easily into any briefcase or handbag. Yet its performance belies its small size. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

The PK320 is a 100-lumen, 8 oz., pocket-sized Pico projector that can project widescreen images up to 150&amp;#8221; It not only connects to any device, (computers, tablets, smart phones, gaming consoles, or digital cameras and camcorders), but it also has a microSD card slot (up to 32GB) and on-board Office Viewer software that allow users to see Microsoft Office files (word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.), as well as most common image formats, in their native form without the need for PC.  Otoma&amp;#8217;s all new ML300 represents the company&amp;#8217;s second offering in the &amp;#8220;mobile&amp;#8221; projector category. At 1.4 lbs and measuring a sleek 7.2&amp;rdquo; x 1.8&amp;rdquo; x 4.4&amp;rdquo;, it fits easily into any briefcase or handbag. Yet its performance belies its small size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://podcast.tech-talk-with-craig-peterson.com/pod/TTWCP-650-04-jon_grodem-optomausa.com-projectors.mp3&quot;&gt;File Download (11:17 min / 4 MB)&lt;/a&gt;    </content:encoded>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Dennis Peng the CMO at Ooma joins Craig on the floor at CES to discuss a breakthrough technology that is transforming the landscape of consumer telephony. There is so much wrong with phone service today it&amp;#8217;s pricey, limited, and inflexible &amp;#8211; and we made it our mission to create a better customer phoning experience. Ooma, Inc., the leading provider of HD-quality free home phone service, today announced a new cordless handset with superior HD Voice call clarity and smartphone features made possible by the Ooma cloud-enabled platform.  Ooma customers can save even more money on their mobile calling plan by tapping into their Ooma account on the go and making phone calls over any Wi-Fi or 3G network with the Ooma Mobile HD app. The Ooma Mobile HD app is compatible with Android devices as well as the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad. It costs $9.99 to download from app stores. The combination of the Ooma Telo and new Ooma HD2 Handset provides cutting-edge HD Voice call clarity by capturing twice the voice data to double the fidelity of standard phone calls, for richer, more natural-sounding conversations. Immediately following this interview Craig will be joined by Jim Bak the Director of Community Relations at Inrix.  They will discuss real-time traffic information and connected driving services in the car, online and on mobile devices. INRIX&apos;s traffic intelligence platform is fueled by the world&apos;s largest community of drivers. Through sophisticated analysis of real-time data from 50 million vehicles and hundreds of public and private sources, INRIX knows the best routes and keeps drivers moving with real-time updates on changes to conditions along the way.  Traffic congestion costs us $100 billion last year, nearly $750 for every commuter or 34 hours per year stuck in traffic for the average commuter. At CES, we&apos;re introducing new intelligent driving services with Ford and JVC that integrate consumer&apos;s own mobile devices with in-car systems for delivering traffic information that makes driving easier everyday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
