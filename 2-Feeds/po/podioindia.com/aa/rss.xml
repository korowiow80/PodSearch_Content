         <description>As 2009 unfolds with new hopes, we wish to thank you for your support and wish you and your family a very happy new year. Back in May 2008, we had introduced to you Smita Ravichandran and Akshay Hari - two high-schoolers with dreams of making it to Bollywood. Since they heard each other in that episode, they started collaborating online and recording duets. In this episode, we talk to both of them to know about their passion for music, their aspirations, their academic goals and their preparations for their first joint live performance. Akshay and Smita are performing on January 24 in Pittsburgh in a fundraiser to aid the Mumbai tragedy victims. They share a few of their lovely duets (Hey Shona, Mujhe Haq Hai and Khuda Jaane) with us and invite all of you to this concert and help this great cause. Happy Listening!</description>

         <description>Awaaz Anjane wishes all our listeners a very happy Diwali. In this special episode, we bring to you excerpts from our conversation with Rex D'Souza - finalist in the 2005 Fame Gurukul contest. For long a frontrunner in that contest, Rex narrowly missed the crown. But his eversmiling face, romantic voice and penchant for melody left a mark in the audience's hearts. His live concerts are a treat and he thrives in the interaction with the crowd. Rex talks to us about his early years, earning Rs 50 in his first show to where life has taken him now. Shows around the world, K for Kishore and Jo Jeeta Wohi Champion contests have been a part of this journey so far. He also talks about his recent initiation into classical vocal training and the upcoming Bollywood playback projects. Our best wishes, Rex! Happy Listening!</description>

         <description>In this episode, we introduce you to Shaoni Mitra - the winner of TVS Sa Re Ga Ma 1996. As Shaoni says these were real early years for the mega-successful contest, with Sonu Niigaam beginning his anchoring stints and musical stalwarts taking on the role of judges. Shaoni, with her classical background had fared well in all the rounds and eventually won the best female singer award. She has been busy since doing radio, TV, playback singing and live performances. Her favorite singer is Asha Bhosle though she enjoys Lata Mangeshkar songs as well. We get a sample of the range Shaoni possesses as she takes us through ghazals and film songs with equal aplomb. In the next episode, we will talk to another talent hunt contest participant - Rex D'Souza - finalist in Fame Gurukul. Happy Listening!</description>

In the birthday webcast, some of our popular Awaaz Anjane stars (Akshay, Azam, Deblina, Des, Elmar, Santosh, Soumitra and Vidyu) took part and received comments from the icon singer himself! In this season-opener episode, we share with you highlights of their songs and read out Sonu Niigaam's responses. Enjoy this episode. And if you are around the Columbus, Ohio area, do visit us at the India Festival this Saturday, Sep 20, 2008. Happy Listening!</description>

         <description>Musical fundraisers are a perfect treat for concert lovers. You have a good time listening to the soul-stirring strains while experiencing the joy of giving. Such opportunity now comes in the form of Ekal Vidyalaya Foundation's series of fundraising concerts. Beginning in Cleveland on May 30, the concert then moves across the nation. Sreedhar Nair of Ekal's Cleveland chapter explains the concept behind Ekal and how a dollar-a-day brings functional literacy to tribal areas in India. Music for the fundraisers is provided by the Pandya family of Lexington, Kentucky. Raj Pandya of this gifted family, comprising of wife Smruthi, son Amit and daughter Eshna tells us about the family's association with Ekal and talks about their music. Happy Listening!</description>
