            <title>Compton Verney</title>
            <description>Lancelot Capability Brown laid out the grounds of this grade one listed mansion house in the heart of Warwickshire not far from Stratford Upon Avon. This Talking the Walk takes us on a stroll round the lake with John Schumann - the head groundsman who took over from his father 30 years ago - and historian John Phibbs who has made a particular study of Capability Brown&apos;s work. When you &apos;ve done the walk why not visit the house which is now an art gallery housing the Peter Moore&apos;s Foundation collection. </description>

            <title>Warwick - Talking the Walk</title>
            <description>Warwick - the county town of Warwickshire in the heart of England - is well known for its fabulous castle but there&apos;s much more to the town than that and visitors will be missing out if they don&apos;t venture outside its mighty walls. Much of the Tudor part of the town was destroyed by a catastrophic fire at the end of the 17th century and what grew from the ashes was a delightful Georgian town. But the tomb of Elizabeth 1st favourite Robert Dudley survives and what about the run away tram! Join Warwick&apos;s Town Crier, Graham Sutherland, his wife Mo (both Blue Badge Guides) who take us on a walk around this lovely town and get a local&apos;s eye view</description>
