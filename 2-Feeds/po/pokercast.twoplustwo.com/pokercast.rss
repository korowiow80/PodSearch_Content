         <description><![CDATA[This week on the Two Plus Two PokerCast the guys continue coverage of the 43rd annual World Series of Poker recapping all the completed action and currently ongoing events.  They discuss some controversy involving Jonathan "FatalError" Aguiar and a new World Series of Poker rule that requires players at all live-streamed featured and final tables to verbally declare all of their actions. The feature guest is poker pro and former MIT black jack team member Andy Bloch who won his first WSOP bracelet in Event #7 ($1500 Seven-Card Stud) by defeating Barry Greenstein heads-up for the title and over $126,000.  Andy talks about how it felt to finally win the coveted WSOP bracelet he's been chasing for so many years, shares some details about his Heads-Up match with Viktor "isildur1" Blom and even provides some Seven-Card Stud tournament strategy.  In the third segment Mike and Adam briefly connect with friend of the show and professional tough guy Terrence Chan to hear about his impressive streak of cashes at this year's World Series.  In forum static they preview the next round of "Stand Up Comedy Madness" and of course give away the password for the June 10th Poker Stars VIP Club Invitational for PokerCast listeners.
