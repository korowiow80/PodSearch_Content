<p>After parting ways with OMGKpop, I took the time off and revisited some old non-Asian music I used to listen to.

<p>Kylie is one of those artists that can do no wrong.  She&#8217;s lovable as a personality and can turn on the sizzle when she needs to.  She is one of the few Western artists that can don a kimono and geisha wig and make it work in the most artful and classy way possible &#8211; even in a bikini &#8211; in a bathtub.</p>

<p>I was able to sit down with Iris on the last day of the festival on Mother&#8217;s Day where we chatted over coffee about her film, identity and the state of the Asian American film industry in general.

Grab Your Glowsticks!</p>
<p>This was at the request of Cassandra who wanted to hear a para-trance/ eurobeat show.  Since there are so many forms of trance music and everyone has their own opinion on it, I came up with this non-stop mix.  Personally, I&#8217;m more of a house and club beat girl.</p>
<p>Course, just hours after I finished the mix down, I got inundated with remixes for After School&#8217;s new track <em>Bang!</em> (You must check out the<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEEQlP-_Uf0&#038;fmt=22"> drumline</a> &#8211; seriously hot!)  I&#8217;m still waiting around for a decent SNSD, <em>Run Devil Run</em> remix to also be released.</p>
<p>Most of the remixes played can be found via YouTube, so you&#8217;ll have to do some legwork, but I will have the playlist after the jump.</p>
<p>My next episode, #41, I&#8217;ll be talking to Ellie Lee, from AATheory.com and Seoulbeats about her new project on racism.  Stay tuned!<br />

Grab Your Glowsticks!
This was at the request of Cassandra who wanted to hear a para-trance/ eurobeat show.  Since there are so many forms of trance music and everyone has their own opinion on it, I came up with this non-stop mix.  Personally, I&#8217;m more of a house and club beat girl.
Course, just hours after I finished the mix down, I got inundated with remixes for After School&#8217;s new track Bang! (You must check out the drumline &#8211; seriously hot!)  I&#8217;m still waiting around for a decent SNSD, Run Devil Run remix to also be released.
Most of the remixes played can be found via YouTube, so you&#8217;ll have to do some legwork, but I will have the playlist after the jump.
My next episode, #41, I&#8217;ll be talking to Ellie Lee, from AATheory.com and Seoulbeats about her new project on racism.  Stay tuned!

Playlist
1. DJ Amaya &#8211; After School- Because of You [DJ Amaya vs. Groovebot Club Remix]
2. Aliks &#8211; Luvotomy (ft. Namie Amuro &#038; Freemasons)
3. G Sweet &#8211; Brown Eyed Girls &#8211; Abracadabra V2.0 G Sweet Remix
4. Robotaki &#8211; G-Dragon &#8211; Breathe (Robotaki Remix)

<p>It was a slight challenge getting a hold of Director Lixin Fan.  After all, his prestigious award-winning documentary film LAST TRAIN HOME had him being invited to festivals left, right and center.  Not bad for a Canadian film and a debut feature for this young director from China.</p>
<p>The podcast is of course the edited, film focused version, but I&#8217;ll make the entire Skype interview (a full 30+ mins.) available should people be interested. We went more into depth about the Zhang family as well as freedom of expression and censorship while working within China.  And then we also talked about food and his thoughts upon landing in Toronto (Scarborough) when he first came.</p>

Happy New Year Everyone!</p>
<p>This year end special of POP 88 brings you my personal favorites of 2008.  I really tried to be diverse, and made every effort not to repeat songs I&#8217;ve already played this year.  It is, however, rather bias as you will see/hear.  It is MY personal favorites list, afterall.</p>
<p>Again, I find some trouble finding a decent new years resolution and resolve to use the word &#8220;actually&#8221; less in my podcast &#8230; although listening back to the show, sounds like I&#8217;ve already failed miserably even before the new year started.  Someone run a bean counter on that &#8211; thanks.</p>

Brr &#8230; cold enough for you?  That is, if you&#8217;re on the north eastern seaboard.
Hopefully to warm you up &#8230; or at least your ears is some new music from Anna Tsuchiya, Chemistry and Park Jung Ah.
Also, I have an exclusive interview with Executive Director for the Toronto International Reel Asian Film Festival, Deanna Wong.
