				<p class="stdtext">If you are reading this it is probably because you have tried to make changes in your life and those efforts have not worked well enough to satisfy you. You may be on the verge of understanding that the repetitive patterns of behavior that seem uncontrollable must be addressed at a deeper level to be mastered. Psychoanalytic therapy is a method of investigating the unconscious mind and a recognition of its profound power over us. It is about the slow and sometimes painful work of discovering the truth of our history and of our identity that has for too long been hidden by our own defenses against levels of anxiety, fear, and anger that we could not tolerate.</p>
				<p class="stdtext">Therapy must start with the truth of your life but, of course, it must be much more than just that. The goal of the work is to integrate your mind and sense of self, to foster creative adaptation to life and your unique circumstances, and, ultimately, to open up unrecognized possibilities for work and for love. The result can be an honest experience of abiding joy.</p>
				<p class="stdtext">Anyone who suggests such work is easy or quick has not done it themselves. All that is required to begin is courage. I will do my best to make my office the safest place you have ever known and through the relationship we build together, you will create the strength to make those changes that have eluded you so far. I approach this work as a process that moves toward a deeper level of maturity and increasing powers of creativity.</p>

I approach this work as a process that moves toward a deeper level of maturity and increasing powers of creativity.</p>
				<p class="stdtext">Therapy, at some point, must end but if we work together well, that process is internalized and you continue the direction of it – a direction that, finally, is your own honest choice. The truth will, indeed, set you free but only if you can develop the strength to master it, even affirm it. We can do it together.</p>
				<p class="stdtext"><strong>Call for an Initial Consultation</strong></p>
				<p class="stdtext">Psychotherapy is a personal journey that requires great courage. While I've made every effort to describe my background and approach to therapy on this website, you may still have questions about the intangible human element, and feel that it makes a tremendous difference about how productively we will be able to work together. I invite you to call me any time at (206) 940-6732 to get acquainted and talk about the goals you'd like to bring to therapy. That being said, there is just no substitute for sitting down face-to-face and seeing if the chemistry is right. I encourage you to consider a 3-5 session trial before deciding about longer-term work. To help you make those initial decisions, I offer a 50% discount on each of your first two sessions in order to share the risk as we begin this unique and important relationship.</p>
