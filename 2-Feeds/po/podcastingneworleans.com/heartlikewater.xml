<itunes:author>Heart Like Water</itunes:author>

<description>Hear a family moan as they crawl through the skeleton of their house after Katrina. This episode includes interviews with those who stayed behind. An old man says, "I'm a witness..." and remembers the World Trade Center, Windows on the World, as he sits beneath the skyscrapers of his own destroyed city. A couple in the Ninth Ward says, "They set detonators to blow the levees...  We heard the explosion... They tried to kill us in our sleep." A man in Lafitte, Louisiana says the "Water came up like a heart beat." Another talks about the "Snakes everywhere." Another says he'll never leave, "It's mother nature... This is God's country." A man in St. Bernard who rescued thousands from roofs and attics. A woman describes sitting out on her roof with her family waiting for days -- "They had some stars up there twinkling, letting you know...." A woman returns to Plaquemines, Louisiana -- "Nothing could prepare me for this.... I made a mistake. I took my grandchildren with me." Another says, "We're gonna pick it up from here... We're coming back home."
