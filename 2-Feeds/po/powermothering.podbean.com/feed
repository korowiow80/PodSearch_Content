<p>It can be hard to be patient, though. Especially if constipation sets in. There ARE some practical things you can do to help your toddler understand and work with his body, which are very important skills he&#8217;ll need the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Do remember that patience and lots of hugs are very important for successful potty training. The training process takes time, even if you&#8217;ve originally started with an intense<a title="&quot;toilet" training="training" less="less" than="than" a="a" target="&quot;_blank&quot;"> toilet training in less than a day</a> method, which is fine, but the <em>potty practice</em> may take months to get those habits firmly established.

<p>There are some keys that you cannot ignore if you choose to go this route. Your prep work will look a little different and you need to be careful about your expectations. Potty training is a natural process, to be sure, but a toddler is often totally clueless about what&#8217;s expected of him and that&#8217;s a parent&#8217;s first obstacle to be overcome.</p>
<p>Besides listening to this podcast, you might want to watch the <a title="&quot;potty" training="training" target="&quot;_blank&quot;">potty training day</a> video on this page. It&#8217;s quite insightful and makes sure that you, Mom or Dad, are every bit as ready to potty train as your child, which is key.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My name is Colleen Langenfeld and I have been parenting for over 27 years. I have three grown children and one child still at home. I have discovered over the years that taking care of the daily routines of life in efficient and comfortable ways leaves moms more energy and enthusiasm for what really matters: their precious family.</p>
<p>I love to chat with other moms about mothering, parenting and family issues. I will be podcasting on topics that have proved popular on my site, <a href="http://www.paintedgold.com">www.paintedgold.com</a>, a resource site for busy moms. If there are mom topics<em> you</em> are interested in, leave a comment and let me know!
