      <title>In Town</title>
      <description>Well...! Here are the boys I teach letting their hair down to 'In Town'...

If you feel like joining in, the lyrics are

In town, we buy candy
In town, we get haircuts
In town, we mail letters
In town, we shop for shoes
In town, we borrow books
In town, we go to a movie
In town, we visit a museum
In town, we eat at a restaurant

You can also hear an easy to catch version of this song which is from the Potato Pals series
