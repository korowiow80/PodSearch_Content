		<itunes:summary>Leadership  at Full  Strength podcast answers today’s hottest questions  on    leadership  issues. Jack Zenger and Joe Folkman answer the  following   questions in  this episode:

  

	With the dizzying speed of      change, how can you prepare employees for redundancies without      inadvertently implying that the employment relationship is uncertain ,      unreliable and short term?




	Is Coaching more effective if the      coach is from the same industry as the coachee? (I.E. Are internal coaches      better than external coaches?)




	How can we maintain a leadership development      strategy in an organization, once we have started? 

 


	We are facing      quite a challenge in justifying the cost of doing a leadership program in      our organization, in India. Being able to link it, directly, with increase      in profits should have a very favorable impact on our efforts. What do you      think are some of the best measures of the effectiveness of a development      program?

 


	Does an      organization’s culture have any affect on the sustainability of a      leadership development program?

 


	Could you please      outline some clear, practical methods for collecting ROI on the business      impact of attending the Extraordinary Leader program, including the area      of driving company profits.

 


	In your view,      what part does organizational culture and values play in increasing      performance and profits; and what part does effective leadership play in      fostering values in action and a high performance work culture?

		<itunes:summary>Leadership  at Full  Strength podcast answers today’s hottest questions on    leadership  issues. Jack Zenger and Joe Folkman answer the following   questions in  this episode:









 

	Would a company      in an industry (such as the restaurant industry) that has high employee      turnover benefit from nurturing leaders to improve employee engagement? Or      is it just the nature of the job description that makes people not want to      stay? 

 


	What are some specific ways to      encourage managers to be inspirational, when they have worked for 20+      years being task-oriented?

 


	What can be done to help leaders      retain the awareness and passion to improve that they receive in a      leadership development program?

 


	What would you say to a naysayer      who says that leaders can't learn to be inspiring?

 


	In normal economic times, the      task of motivating and inspiring staff (and clients/customers for that      matter) is relatively straightforward but still a challenge. In these times, managers are at a loss      to be inspiring leaders, so perhaps they need an even higher order of tips      and techniques. It is as if the      basics, well researched and presented by ZF, need another stage, phase, or      layer to charge up and retain employees (and clients/customers) when there      seems to be nothing but bad and worse news. What are some suggestions you      have for getting people who are “down in the dumps” to see that there is      hope for improvement?

 
 


	I manage a group of leaders that      have been with the company a long time and have settled for      "good" not "great" performance. It has been difficult to get them to see      the importance of "going for great" and re-discovering their      "passion" is so important to employee engagement. What is the      most important thing, as a coach, that I should focus on to get them      revved up again?


	 We are almost 2 years into a merger of equals. We are building a new culture and building our Talent Development function and approach to creating leaders from scratch. What are the benefits of training people to become leaders, rather than just recruiting from outside the company? Can great leadership skills even be learned, or is it something we are born with?

<p class="NoSpacing" style="margin-left: 0in;">Leadership at Full Strength podcast answers today’s hottest questions on   leadership issues. Jack Zenger answers the following   questions in this episode:</p>
<ul>
<li>What have you found to be the best way to get the C-Suite&#8217;s to pay attention to the issue of Inspiring Leadership? Most of the time they glaze over - they don&#8217;t seem to get the power of human/leader growth and how it relates to key business outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p class="NoSpacing">
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt "> </span></span></span>Does any of your research address the tool of &#8220;faking it until you make it&#8221;? Meaning should a leader pretend to be enthusiastic, emotionally connected, and people focused or does that always translate as being transparent?</li>
</ul>
<p class="NoSpacing">
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt "> </span></span></span>In the 6 approaches to emotional connection, were there any common combinations? Were some approaches used by leaders more frequently than others?<span> </span>If one of the approaches to emotional connection is a weakness for you, but you try to use it, does it become a detractor to your leadership effectiveness?</li>
</ul>
<p class="NoSpacing">
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt "> </span></span></span>What is the best way to learn to be an inspiring leader?</li>
</ul>
<p class="NoSpacing"><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the employee knows the leader more closely, does that affect the leader’s effectiveness and ability to inspire?</li>
</ul>
<p class="NoSpacing">
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt "> </span></span></span>How does one get emotionally connected to a direct report when there might be HR concerns involved?</li>
</ul>
<p class="NoSpacing">
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt "> </span></span></span>With more and more companies leaning to a remote workforce (i.e. employees in home based office enviornments) - do you have any advice for leadership in this type of working model?</li>
</ul>
<p class="NoSpacing">
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt "> </span></span></span>Do you think that generations have different Passions for Leadership? How do we take that into consideration with the younger X and Y generations coming into the workplace?</li>
</ul>
<p class="NoSpacing">
</p><ul>
<li><span style="font-family: Symbol;"><span><span style="font: 7pt "> </span></span></span>In my experience, business structures are managed quite top-down. Many leaders do not see any &#8220;need&#8221; to connect to their employees, even if it affects the business outcome. Having and using power seems to be a benefit by itself. What is your impression about that?</li>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leadership at Full Strength podcast answers today’s hottest questions on  leadership issues. Jack Zenger and Joe Folkman answer the following  questions in this episode:</p>
<p>  </p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">I’ve      been at my organization for six years and I’d like to move from my department      to a one that interests me more. Do you have any suggestions on how to go      about that?</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">As a      manager, where should I draw the line between providing rewards and      incentives for employees and telling them they should just get their jobs      done because that’s what they’re here for?</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">When      you manage in the trenches daily as a VP and Executive management preaches      leadership and training and mentoring, why does it seem to escape them? It      is easy for them to talk about, but all of us are in the trenches      wondering why it doesn’t apply to senior management.</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">I      believe that working on strengths is vital to a leader’s ability to improve,      but often times “Work on your strengths, not your weaknesses,” is thrown      around as an end-all-fix-all. Are there certain follow-up activities that      I can perform to ensure that my leaders and those I manage are actually      working on strengths? In addition, what can I do after the training is      over to renew their fire for wanting to develop their strengths and      hopefully avoid the drop-off in development that comes a few days after they      sit through that class?</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">If      management is coaching me, who coaches management? Is there a best      practice to help someone like me who is in middle management act as an      informal coaching role with my direct manager?</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">My      company is in quite a financial pinch, as I imagine most are right now.      What would you say are some of the things my company can do      development-wise to continue developing our employees without having to spend      large amounts of money?</li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">
</p><ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">Our      organization has a lot of turnover in upper management. Every few years one      of our major departments gets a new head or some C-level executive changes      positions or leaves for another job at another company. Every time this      happens it seems we have to rediscover how our current culture will fit in      with the style each new manager. What can we do to stabilize our      organization, regardless of who is leading us?</li>
</ul>

<p>  </p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0in;" type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">Is      there such a thing as a perfect leader—regardless of situation? Or are      there leaders better suited for certain jobs and industries over others? I      work in the technology industry and would like to know if a specific type      of leader would be better suited to my industry than another.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">What      would you say to a person whose influence &amp; respect within an      organization is such that they <em>could </em>be a very good leader but does not have aspirations or desire to be a      leader?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Has      leadership changed with the passing of time? Are leaders different today      than say, 50 years ago? 25 years? 10 years?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">How      can I use incentive programs &amp; packages to help create a culture where      going the extra mile and reaching for lofty goals is the norm?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">The      culture where I work is specifically catered to certain types of leaders,      and the only leaders who last are the ones that fit our organization’s      “mold.”<span> </span>I don’t feel like I fit      into that “mold” very well, but I don’t think I’m a bad leader…I just lead      in a different way than my org. would like. What can I do to either change      the way I lead (which I don’t want to do because it’s unnatural to me) or      to get my company to respect the kind of leader that I am?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">In an      organization rooted in “Tradition” and “This is the way it is,” how do I get      people excited to jump on the ‘change’ bandwagon?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">I’ve      been at my company for 6 years now and I have a lot of responsibility, but      I’d like to move from my department to another area that interests me      more. Any tips on how to approach a situation like that?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">You      guys mention that we should work on our strengths, and for the most part I      agree.<span> </span>But what about a situation      where I am passionate about something and love doing it but am not      necessarily good at doing it? In other words, it’s not a strength for me      but it’s something that I’d like to develop and spend time at. Would I      benefit more by focusing on something that I’m good at, or should I work      on a passion that I’m not very competent in?</li>

		<itunes:summary>Leadership at Full Strength podcast answers today's hottest questions on leadership issues. Jack Zenger and Joe Folkman answer the following questions in this episode:

  

	Is      there such a thing as a perfect leader—regardless of situation? Or are      there leaders better suited for certain jobs and industries over others? I      work in the technology industry and would like to know if a specific type      of leader would be better suited to my industry than another.
	What      would you say to a person whose influence &#x38; respect within an      organization is such that they could be a very good leader but does not have aspirations or desire to be a      leader?
	Has      leadership changed with the passing of time? Are leaders different today      than say, 50 years ago? 25 years? 10 years?
	How      can I use incentive programs &#x38; packages to help create a culture where      going the extra mile and reaching for lofty goals is the norm?
	The      culture where I work is specifically catered to certain types of leaders,      and the only leaders who last are the ones that fit our organization’s      “mold.” I don’t feel like I fit      into that “mold” very well, but I don’t think I’m a bad leader…I just lead      in a different way than my org. would like. What can I do to either change      the way I lead (which I don’t want to do because it’s unnatural to me) or      to get my company to respect the kind of leader that I am?
	In an      organization rooted in “Tradition” and “This is the way it is,” how do I get      people excited to jump on the ‘change’ bandwagon?
	I’ve      been at my company for 6 years now and I have a lot of responsibility, but      I’d like to move from my department to another area that interests me      more. Any tips on how to approach a situation like that?
	You      guys mention that we should work on our strengths, and for the most part I      agree. But what about a situation      where I am passionate about something and love doing it but am not      necessarily good at doing it?
