I have posted a short film I made using clips taken on my cell phone video camera. It is essentially a brief meditation on time as experienced through I2 technologies. All the sound and visual elements are derived from the clips themselves. Nothing has been added.

For some time now, I've grappled with the issue of what direction my music should take following the release of my first CD, LONGTIME. Originally, I recorded a followup album entitled GONE SO LONG, which attempted to expand the guitar-based textures of LONGTIME into a piano trio format. Although this collection received critical praise, I was unable to generate label interest for an official release.

In the meantime, I was becoming increasingly frustrated with the guitar-bass-drums (and piano) setup that had come to characterize popular music. I resolved therefore to renew my study of music composition in an effort to explore the possibilities inherent in more diverse instrumental ensembles. 

Along the way, I re-discovered my former fascination with ambient music and as a result, my interest in absolute musical forms began to dissolve into a seemingly endless sea of color, sound, and texture. These days, I find myself more interested in the materials that emerge into form rather than the form itself. When the form has emerged, I figure my job is done.

The following podcast entitled ALTERNATE is presented as a first step in unifying my interest in ambient sound and popular song. As on the LONGTIME CD, my method was recording technology. The works on this album were created in a variety of formats: 4-track cassette, 8-track analog, 16-track ADAT, 16-track analog, 24-track analog, and digital multi-track. Many of the tracks were then augmented using Logic, Audacity, and Garageband.

My thanks to the friends and collaborators whose skills and insights made this project a reality. The results of our efforts are presented here for your approval.
