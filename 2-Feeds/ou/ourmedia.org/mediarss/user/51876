 <title>Mormon Truth Podcast #15-An Interview With Jared, A Mormon Apologist-Part 2</title>

 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-15-interview-jared-mormon-apologist-part-2</link>
 <description><![CDATA[Okay guys and gals, this is part 2 out of 4, of the interview that Eric(Living Truth Podcast) and I did with Jared, who is a Mormon Apologist. Jared is also a great guy who strongly believes in his faith and can usually find an explanation for most anything. I do give Jared credit though, for coming on the show with us and at least being able to admit some of the faults that are in the Church; but then, unfortunately, he has to explain them away and tell us why they are okay, or don't impact his overall testimony. Jared is a very nice friendly guy, but we do have to agree to disagree on about every subject.In Part 2, we pick up where we left off in part 1, continuing our discussion of "The Book of Mormon" and the lack of any evidence whatsoever of "The Book of Mormon", the people, their cities, etc. Jared likes to point out the errors and discrepancies in the Bible, in order to justify the errors and problems in the Book of Mormon and Mormonism in general. Jared admits that it doesn't matter if they ever find any archaeological evidence of The Book of Mormon and that it wouldn't affect his testimony one way or the other. I say that if you have to claim the Bible to be so wrong, in order to justify that Mormonism and The Book of Mormon are okay with so many screwed up things and errors, why would your wrong be right?Jared likes to refer to current and past teachings of Apostles and Prophets, as "statements, opinions, traditions, their personal beliefs, or whatever", but that it doesn't mean that it's truth. I honestly have no idea how Jared, or most apologists, determine what Mormon doctrine is or isn't, due to the fact that nobody ever really knows when these so called Prophets and Apostles are speaking for God, or just sharing their personal opinion. In my opinion, it's ridiculous!! At one point, both Jared and I are astounded at each others views and express that to each other. There is much more to this part 2 and I really hope that you guys enjoy this episode, as much as we did making it for you.Also, I will be putting out parts 3 and 4 later on today, so that everyone can hear how the rest of this interview went.]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[This is part 1 of 4, of an interview with a great guy named Jared. Eric, from "The Living Truth Podcast", graciously invited both Jared and myself, onto his show, so that we could all share our views on Mormonism. Jared is a current, faithful, active, member of the Mormon Church and wanted to explain his view on things and where Eric and I are going wrong in our analysis of the Mormon Church. In part 1, Jared explains why he wanted to come on the show with both of us, and he also gives his description of how the Mormon Church came to be. We discussed the First Vision, the apostasy, and the differences between the Bible and Book of Mormon. We also discussed the fact that God the Father lives on Kolob and has polygamous wives, according to Mormon doctrine. Eric and I also brought up the fact that there is not one shred of "REAL" evidence, of any kind, of the Book of Mormon people, battles, wars, cities, etc, especially in and around the Hill Cumorah in New York, where it should be plentiful. We also asked Jared who the Lamanites are and where they are located, since the Book of Mormon was written primarily and specifically for them, according to the title page. I think that you guys will really enjoy this a lot!!Thanks again everyone for listening and stay tuned for parts 2-4, coming soon.Samuel the Utahnite]]></description>

 <title>Mormon Truth Podcast #13-Interview With Living Truth&#039;s Eric-Part 2</title>
 <guid>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-13-interview-living-truths-eric-part-2</guid>
 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-13-interview-living-truths-eric-part-2</link>
 <description><![CDATA[This is part 2 of my podcast with "The Living Truth's" Eric, who is doing an outstanding job by the way. I'm always amazed, at how great his knowledge is, regarding all things Mormon, which in most cases, easily surpasses the knowledge of most members and certainly the apologists. At least Eric is able to use his brain and logic, to see things plainly and exactly the way they are, unlike the Mopologists like FARMS "Daniel C. Peterson" or FAIRS "John Lynch" who will claim that an apple is really a pineapple, and they'll show you how.We talk about a lot of things in this part 2, including my journey to the truth and out of Mormonism, which included a big dose of Cognitive dissonance, along that path, as I tried to reconcile what I was finding, with what I had been taught all my life. We discussed Darron Smith and the article in the Salt Lake City Weekly, which was really the impetus, that got me onto the path that I'm on now. That led me to Hinckley's interviews, which we discuss, along with polygamy and many other things.We also discussed exactly "what is a special witness of Jesus Christ", since that is what the Apostles and Prophets, refer to themselves as. I also discuss my feelings on leaving the Mormon cult and the impact that it has had on me emotionally, spiritually and also in regard to my family and friends.Also, at the beginning of this podcast, I play the "audio of Gordon B. Hinckley", the current Mormon Prophet's words, from this past Saturdays General Priesthood Session, April 1,2006, regarding racism. I also give a few comments on what I think about the situation.I also just wanted to give a big shout out to Eric and say thanks again for having me on your podcast!! Let's do it again soon!!]]></description>

 <title>Mormon Truth Podcast #12-Interview With Living Truth&#039;s Eric-Part 1</title>

 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-12-interview-living-truths-eric-part-1</link>
 <description><![CDATA[This is part 1 of 2, of the interview that I just had with Eric, from the Living Truth Podcast and Mormon Deception blog. He asked some great questions regarding why I left the Church, how I discovered it was a fraud and what the process of discovery was like for me. I also shared my view on the "early cult indoctrination program" of the Mormon cult, that is alive and well, just as it was when I was a kid growing up Mormon. We also talked about my mission and some of the experiences that I had, along with some of the abuses I suffered, along with some of the rules of my super-repressive and abusive mission Presidents. We also touched on the lack of separation between Church and state here in Utah and how it doesn't exist. I discuss the incredible guilt that is heaped on missionaries for not baptizing enough people and all the rules they must follow. We also discussed that "LOGIC" or "INDEPENDENT THINKING", is not really allowed or tolerated in the Mormon cult. Thanks Eric for the great questions!! Enjoy everyone and go check out his blogs!!]]></description>

 <title>Mormon Truth Podcast #10-Is Mormonism A Cult?!!-Part 2</title>
 <guid>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-10-mormonism-cult-part-2</guid>
 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-10-mormonism-cult-part-2</link>
 <description><![CDATA[This is a continuation of the last podcast and part 2 of "is Mormonism a cult?" In part 1, I discussed the first 7 of 15 items on the "cult checklist." Those that have already listened to part 1, know that we went 7-7 and so far, everything is checking out 100%, that Mormonism is indeed a cult, without a doubt. I shared many examples and I will share many more in this 2nd part of the podcast, covering items 8-15 on the "cult checklist."I will also include several clips from the pre-1990 temple ceremony, which will include the penalties that went along with it, which I sadly agreed to obey out of fear and lifelong brainwashing. It is sick and twisted stuff and I can't believe that I agreed to give up my own life before revealing "the secrets."If, after part 1, you still have doubts that Mormonism is a cult, this 2nd part, should be able to easily erase that doubt and convince you that Mormonism is definitely a cult. I also share a clip of Spencer W. Kimball, one from Hinckley and we'll even get to hear from Adam(God) himself, in a guest appearance, exhorting us to obey these men called Prophets, Seers, Revelators and Apostles. So, here's the bottom line; if you liked part 1, you are gonna love part 2. For those that would like to dispute the facts that I've presented, that Mormonism is a huge cult; I look forward to your comments and Emails. I will be fascinated to see how you explain away all of these obvious facts. Then again, it's probably just all a coincidence, that you can go through a cult checklist and check them off one by one, right?]]></description>

 <title>Mormon Truth Podcast #9-Is Mormonism A Cult?!!-Part 1</title>
 <guid>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-9-mormonism-cult-part-1</guid>
 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-9-mormonism-cult-part-1</link>
 <description><![CDATA[In this podcast, I go through the cult checklist to once and for all, decide if Mormonism is a cult or not. I'm using the list from the ICSA (International Cultic Studies Association). Here is a quote from the website of the ICSA:"The International Cultic Studies Association (ICSA) is an interdisciplinary network of academicians, professionals, former group members, and families who study and educate the public about social-psychological influence and control, authoritarianism, and zealotry in cultic groups, alternative movements, and other environments. Founded in 1979 as AFF (American Family Foundation), ICSA took on its current name in late 2004 to better reflect the organization's focus and increasingly international and scholarly dimensions."The list that I'm using is entitled "Characteristics Associated with Cultic Groups" and was written and created by Janja Lalich, Ph.D. & Michael D. Langone, Ph.D. I'm sure that Mormons will find a way to discredit this website, this list and these people because Mormonism and the Mormon Church just couldn't possibly really be a cult, right? In fact, most members, as I once did, find it extremely offensive to be labeled as a cult and/or cult member.On the ICSA website, it is also states that:"ICSA does NOT maintain a list of "bad" groups or "cults." We nonjudgmentally list groups on which we have information.Groups listed, described, or referred to on ICSA's Web sites may be mainstream or nonmainstream, controversial or noncontroversial, religious or nonreligious, cult or not cult, harmful or benign.We encourage inquirers to consider a variety of opinions, negative and positive, so that inquirers can make independent and informed judgments pertinent to their particular concerns."So, with that being said, this group is not "out-to-get" the Mormons or "persecute" them as Mormons seem to love, as it just further proves that the Church is true is some twisted, jacked up, cognitive dissonance way. I encourage everyone to listen to this podcast and decide for yourselves; "is Mormonism a cult?"]]></description>

 <title>Mormon Truth Podcast #8-Brent Belnap&#039;s Interview On The Today Show</title>
 <guid>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-8-brent-belnaps-interview-today-show</guid>
 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-8-brent-belnaps-interview-today-show</link>
 <description><![CDATA[Well, this has been irritating me ever since I first heard this interview and I really felt the extreme need to address the mis-truths and flat out lies that Brent Belnap, (Mormon Stake President of Manhattan), felt the need to propagate during his recent interview with Matt Lauer on the Today show. The ending of the interview and the final question of Matt Lauer and then Brent Belnap's answer, was astonishing to me and one of the biggest lies I've heard yet. It sums up the lies, deceit and fraud of Mormonism perfectly.It just proves that the Mormon Church will continue to openly lie and defraud people in order to keep their stone of lies and deceit, rolling through the world. Don't think for one second, that Brent Belnap wasn't prepared and told what to say by Mormon Hierarchy. He was fully prepped and probably even had a list of questions from the Today show that he might be asked. To think otherwise, would be the ultimate case of naiveté. If they did know in advance what the questions would be, that makes him and The Mormon Hierarchy look even worse and more complicit in this latest escapade of lying to a Nationwide TV audience. The Mormon Church would never EVER let someone go on national TV without full preparation of what to lie about. I look forward to all of your comments on the lies that Brent Belnap and The Mormon Hierarchy are continually propagating throughout the world, such as those that are shared in this piece. I think that everyone will really enjoy listening to this podcast and will be able to clearly see the deceit of Mormon Hierarchy upon the world.]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[In this podcast, I review the most recent hatemail that I've received, along with my opinions and rebuttals to what they are saying about me. Some of it is funny, some of it is pathetic and sad while some of it is just ridiculous. I also take a run through my reviews on iTunes and have a few good laughs along the way, as well as pointing out where these anti-anti-Mormons are going wrong in their attack of me and the truth. This podcast is a pretty revealing look into the head of an anti-anti Mormon and the twisted logic that they use to justify their beliefs. I also discuss the postive reviews that I've received and thank those that have given them. Enjoy everyone!!]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[This is hopefully only the first installment of many to come, of "famous Mormons in the media." In this installment, I discuss Shawn King's (Larry King's wife) recent appearance on the Howard Stern Radio show along with the interview. There were a lot of questions regarding her "magic or lucky garments." She laughs through most of the interview, wondering why Howard wants to keep his mind and the topic on her "magic underwear and sex life." Gee, like she didn't know how it was going to be? Meanwhile, her Dad is stomping around absolutely furious in the green room, as Howard just can't stop talking about her "magic underwear." This is hillarious and I think you guys are gonna love it!! For those that are easily offended and don't like sexual innuendo or topics, then this podcast isn't for you and I highly suggest that you don't listen to it. This is why I have the explicit label on my podcast as you never know what I'm going to talk about or present. Take care everyone and enjoy!!]]></description>

 <title>Mormon Truth Podcast #6-Better off dead?!!</title>
 <guid>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-6-better-dead</guid>
 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-6-better-dead</link>
 <description><![CDATA[This podcast describes in depth, with exact quotes, how Mormon Prophets and Apostles have advocated, that it is better "to be dead" or "to come home in a pine box", then to break the law of chastity or allow any degree of immorality. Here is an example, as quoted in Kimball's famous/celebrated Miracle Of forgiveness; Heber J. Grant said, "There is no true Latter-day Saint who would not rather bury a son or daughter than to have him or her lose his or her chastity. I then break down the entire talk, "Love and Lust" given by former Mormon Prophet Spencer W. Kimball at a BYU Devotional in 1965. He condemns everyone from the average sinner, to people that don't understand meanings of words, to homosexuals, masturbators, fornicators and even those that just have an occasional thought about sex. He leaves no stone unturned in condemning everybody. He is an equal opportunity condemner!! This podcast will allow everyone to get a better insight into just who Spencer W. Kimball really was and it isn't pretty.]]></description>

 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-5-tithing-and-filthy-lucre-part-2</link>
 <description><![CDATA[This podcast describes in great detail, the manner in which the Mormon Church Hierarchy, robs from the poor, to give to the rich, which is to give to themselves. I will take a journey through several quotes by Gordon B. Hinckley, James E. Faust and others, to prove this to be true. You will leave this podcast with no doubts, I promise. I will also talk very candidly about where the Church spends all their money. They are more of a real estate company/construction company than a Church. I will discuss all of their current projects that are underway and the Billions that they are spending on them. The Mormon Church is nothing but a rich corporation and anything that has to do with God or Jesus, is just window dressing in order to get more filthy lucre by robbing the poor, every chance they get. The Mormon Church and their actions, are a complete disgrace to mankind!!]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[The purpose of this podcast is to share and discuss the "real truth" about the Mormon Church and expose the fraud, lies and true history of Mormonism. I want to discuss openly the things that Mormon General Authorities pretend never existed or that they claim to know nothing about.It's time to uncover the lies and reveal the truth, for all the world to know, including current Mormon membership. Since the current Mormon General Authorities won't do it, I guess I'll have to do it.I will share my opinions, experiences and viewpoints without holding back!!It's time for the truth to be told so that the truth can set us free!!]]></description>

 <title>Mormon Truth-Pocast #3-Joseph Smith</title>

 <description><![CDATA[This Podcast is all about Joseph Smith and many of the horrible and dishonest things that he did during his life. It was all done in the name of God. As the Church celebrates Joseph Smith's birthday with parties all year long, I want to say, that he is clearly, not an example that any children should want to follow. He was a disgraceful human being that did some horrilbe things!!]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[This podcast is all about the life of Joseph Smith and some of the dirty deeds that he was involved with. Joseph Smith was not an honorable man rather a despicable man. I certainly wouldn't want my children looking up to him as an example as the Mormon Church recommends. I discuss his polygamy, the Kirtland Bank failure where he defrauded most of the depositors while sneaking out of town claiming that he was "escaping mob violence."  I also discuss problems with the First Vision. Joseph Smith married girls as young as 14, other men's wives, other men's pregnant wives, sisters and also Mother/Daugher combos and he did it all in the name of God while also claiming that an angel with a flaming sword would slay him if he didn't do these things. Does this sound like a holy man? Does this sound like a Prophet of God? This is the man that Mormons are celebrating this year with parties and celebrations, with one more to come, his official birthday bash on December 23rd. All I can say is, what an embarrassment that this man is the founder of the Mormon Church!! Unless you sustain him and all of his actions, as a Prophet of God, you are not allowed to enter the Mormon temple.]]></description>

 <title>Mormon Truth-Podcast #2-Mission experiences and the hill Cumorah.</title>
 <guid>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-2-mission-experiences-and-hill-cumorah</guid>
 <link>http://www.ourmedia.org/media/mormon-truth-podcast-2-mission-experiences-and-hill-cumorah</link>
 <description><![CDATA[In this Podcast, I mainly discuss two things; feelings that I had during my Mormon mission to Argentina as I read directly from my mission journal and then what should have been found in the hill Cumorah in New York. I read directly from Ether, in The Book of Mormon, about how many died, what battle gear they used, etc. I also touched upon a few other topics of interest from this past week. For more details, you can read my latest post on my blog here or just listen to the show. I hope you enjoy it!!]]></description>
