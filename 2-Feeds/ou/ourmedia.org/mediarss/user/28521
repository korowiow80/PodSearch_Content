 <description><![CDATA[I have just finished my first day of NaNoWriMo. My first 1667 words are in the can--it turns out that it was actually 2051 words--and they came easier than I thought they would. I didn’t finish what I consider a chapter, but I think I got a good start. The ideas are flowing, and I have set milemarkers for myself along the way, rather than worry about the plot.]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[It happens every time I sit down to write. I tap away on the keys like a mad man, the words just gush from some place deep down. It's like I'm a spillway at the end of the line at a prose factory--for about ten minutes. Then the torrent becomes a stream, the stream a trickle, the trickle a drip, and an hour later I find myself staring at the cursor standing there at the bottom like a tiny blinking Atlas bearing the weight of the five- hundred or so words I've written.]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[I’ve wanted to see Saw for a while, and now that I’ve seen Saw I want to see Saw II. Saw II will be an inexact copy of the original, kinda like The Blair Witch 2. The magic potion that made Saw, and the original Blair Witch as riveting as they were just can’t translate to a sequel; the cat is already out of the bag. ]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[I've been re-reading Chris Baty's book No Plot? No Problem! Around chapter two he talks about forego-able time; finding way to scrimp enough time out of the day to write your novel. What brought this to mind was the discovery of a neat little excel spreadsheet from the good folks over at To- Done. ]]></description>

 <description><![CDATA[I plan this, at least, weekly podcast to share my progress in my second attempt at winning the NaNoWriMo. I won’t go into too much detail about what NaNoWriMo is, because if you have found this podcast it is a sure bet that you already know what NaNoWriMo is. If not, make sure to check my web site (http://theyshootwerewolvesdontthey.blogspot.com) for links pertinent to each week’s podcast.]]></description>
