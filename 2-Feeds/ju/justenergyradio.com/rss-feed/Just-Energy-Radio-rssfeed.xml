Franks documentary Beyond Belief explores compelling new evidence that the eighteen 'missing' years of Jesus' life, unaccounted for in The Bible , were spent with Rishi's, Yogi's and Swami's of India, and also focuses on significant evidence that Jesus lived to be around 100 years old and is buried in Kashmir.
