      <title>9SCF - 9 Squirrels and a Hatfish?</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1093581/600x600_2693701.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4 of us are back for another exciting episode of 9SCF.  We started off the show with Dug's thoughts and why he wasn't speaking.  We chatted about Todd's diary and how great of voices Big Chip can do.  Dug was insistent on having Todd ask question to people in the shit box via the computer, somehow not realizing that he was basically asking the question on the air and that those people could hear him.  We also chatted about TJ, his many names, and how loyal of a listener he is, which got Big Chip all sorts of aroused.  </description>

      <title>9SCF - There's 5 of us now?</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1093581/600x600_2693701.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody's here for this episode of 9SCF.  And since Todd is a fucking technology great, they now can have actual call in/people joining in on segments.  Our test and first guest was Sir Thomas of the West Coast.  So there was a lot of craziness with our technical 5th member joining us for 3/4ths of the show.  Great music as well as great topics.</description>
