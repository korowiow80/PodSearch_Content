      <title>CHRISTOPHER MOON President &amp; Founder Haunted times Magazine </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/36039/600x600_2304463.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHRISTOPHER MOON
President &amp; Founder

Christopher Moon had his first paranormal experience at the age of seven. Daily occurrences from that time on included objects disappearing and reappearing, doors opening and closing on their own fruition, strange shadows and light anomalies, and nightly haunted sonnets on the family&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s one hundred year old grand piano.

He also discovered that he had a definite psychic/ medium sense, and began doing remedial paranormal investigations at a mere 12 years of age. After years of paranormal and psychic occurrences, at the age of 16, Christopher decided he could no longer turn his back on what he felt he was truly meant to do. Thus, he officially began his life as a paranormal researcher, and in 2004, published his first issue of his now worldwide distributed Haunted Times Magazine.

Christopher is also one of the few people able who can accurately operate Thomas Edison&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Telephone to the Dead, and uses the device for paranormal research and investigations, during his Ghost Hunter University events, and for individuals wanting private readings.

Christopher tours college campuses around the country, lecturing on his ghost hunting techniques and providing positive evidence, as well as interactive investigations using the Telephone to the Dead to many excited students, eager to learn more about the paranormal.

His television interviews and appearances include, most notably, truTv Network&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Door to the Dead, NBC&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Today Show, A &amp; E Network&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Paranormal State, as well as numerous ABC, CBS, NBC, CW (formally the WB), and FOX affiliate stations around the country. He has appeared on many nationwide radio programs, such as Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, Coast to Coast AM with Ian Punnitt, TAPS Radio Beyond Reality, KHOW Radio with Peter Boyles, Canada&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Richard Syrett Show, BBS Radio &#226;&#8364;&#8220; Beyond Two Worlds Radio Show, Clear Channel Radio&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s Real Paranormal Talk,Late Night Live With Dirty D.

Influenced by The Beatles, the twins were singing and strumming at the age of four. Atlantic crossing brought them to Canada where at the age of thirteen they were writing and performing at the local establishments. In 1978 they were invited to combine forces with, Juno award winner, Sweeney Todd. (LONDON RECORDS) Worldwide touring commenced immediately as their new gold album paved their way to sunny California. Upon arriving in Los Angeles they were greeted with a publishing deal (RCA MUSIC) to begin writing vocalizations and musical scores for film, cable and television. 

Desires of new creative outlets began development, now reaching out to the visual side of entertainment. Audio with Video studios were soon built to quench this creative thirst. Philip, now an accomplished award winning Director, Digital FX Artist and Editor is the eyes while Christopher, a successful film and music Producer, Production Designer and Composer became the ears of their ventures. Together they have written, edited, animated, directed and scored some of BILLBOARDs TOP TEN releases including, Film Features, Erotic Thrillers, Music Videos and over seas releases. 

Internationally renown for their provocative style, Independent films soon broadened their horizon. Financing a million-dollar HD digital domain in Los Angeles California, this is where they would design and build their ultimate dreams. As well as endorsed by an array of electronic arts manufacturers, no boundaries would be left untouched. For every new technical toy that their eyes and ears could ever dream of soon became vivid. 

As Apple licensed developers and 3rd party designers for SoftImage, Apple, AMP, APDA and Microsoft, TWINTALK ENTERTAINMENT GROUP, continue to design the future of entertainment and media for all platforms. New concepts with slick designs go hand in hand with the latest web technology. 

Philip and Christopher work with the new world of 24P HD media at their fingertips, they mix a wild imagination with the coolest technology. With over 50 HD features behind them, these boys build it all from scratch with the insight of what's happening tomorrow for the people today. A panoramic view of freedom with the fresh scent of change inspires this duo to create a brave new world for your eyes and ears.

      <title>ArchBishop James Long .Speaks on evil and the Paranormal</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/36039/600x600_659914.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bishop James Long was born in Louisville, Kentucky and was raised Roman Catholic. He attended a Roman Catholic grade school and it was during the time while he was attending Kindergarten that he knew that he had a calling to serve as a priest. His mother had asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up and James pointed at the priest and said, &quot;I want to do what he does.&quot; From then on, his calling to serve as a priest grew stronger as the years progressed until he decided to join the seminary and began his formation.

James graduated from Loyola University in Chicago and continued his priestly studies by enrolling in major seminary (graduate school). It was during this time that James decided that God was calling him to serve in the Old Catholic Church. Throughout his studies in the seminary, James focused primarily on Demonology and Paranormal Studies.
