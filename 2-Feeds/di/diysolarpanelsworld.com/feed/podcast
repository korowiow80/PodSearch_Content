<p>Buying (or making) solar panels is an investment you make toward a better future. For every investment you make, you have to find out the risks involved and its potential payback.</p>
<p>This is the same whether you invest in equity, put your money in the bank or use it to buy a solar energy system.</p>
<p>Even if you know (or have an intuition) that investing in solar panels for your home is a great decision, it doesn’t hurt to estimate how this decision can help you financially.</p>
<p>First, let’s look at the big picture: There is an upfront cost for owning PV panels, and this hurts initially (for many of us, at least). Thankfully this is about all you’ll pay for the next 30+ years, as long as your solar panels last.</p>
<p>When you add up the total cost of your utility bills for the next 30+ years, your perspective will change. This is because it will almost always be more expensive. To make things worse, energy rate only goes skywards over time. And the bill you’re paying now will probably double in 30 years time.</p>
<p>Do you remember what the energy rates were 30 years ago?</p>
<p>Next, in order to know how long it takes to recoup your investment, we have to consider the total upfront cost for a commercial solar panel setup.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things you have to invest in:</p>
<p><strong>1. Equipment cost.</strong> This includes your PV panels, inverters and rechargeable batteries, if applicable. This cost can be paid in one lump sum, or you can get financing from the bank or the supplier. When a loan is involved, you also have to include interests to the total cost.</p>
<p><strong>2. Installation cost.</strong> You can hire a professional installer…or you can do it yourself, if you are handy with these tasks. Installers can charge you an hourly rate or quote you a net price for the installation job.</p>
<p><strong>3. Maintenance cost.</strong> You’re lucky…solar panels need very little maintenance. And damages are usually paid for by the warranty.</p>
<p><strong>4. Miscellaneous costs.</strong> There are other costs involved. You may have to pay for permits and fees to carry out solar panel installation on your roof. Although rare, there may also be taxes involved as the value of your home appreciates due to solar installation. When your solar panel has reached the end of its lifespan, you may also have to pay people to haul your equipment away.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the costs above are defrayed by subsidies and rebates that you may be qualified for. Your utility company, the state and federal government or even the manufacturer often provide these benefits.</p>
<p>Part 2 of this series talks about how long it takes to recoup your investment in the light of the above costs. The article also illustrates how much savings you can expect by installing solar panels at home.</p>

<p>Solar power is touted to be the next biggest solution to mankind’s energy problems.</p>
<p>As we know, there is a huge amount of environmental concerns when we use fossil fuel to generate electricity.</p>
<p>There are carbon emissions, nuclear waste and coal slurries that become toxic lakes, just to name a few.</p>
<p>As a country, we rely heavily on coal. When we use coal, we cause humans (especially miners) to come into contact with carcinogenic elements. This is because toxic heavy metals are found in coal. These can be released into our environment.</p>
<p>Some examples of harmful elements include arsenic, selenium, cadmium, mercury, chromium, boron, and nickel.</p>
<p>Fossil fuel is also limited in supply. This drives up the price of energy. Whenever the price of oil and natural gas rise considerably, the United States relies heavily on coal to reduce expenditure.</p>
<p>Naturally, people will be concerned when presented with such facts. But there is nothing much they can do other than voicing their opinions.</p>
<p>Fortunately humans also discovered photovoltaics, a technology used to produce electricity from sunlight.</p>
<p>As solar panels become more and more effective, they become a sustainable solution to a desperate world with insatiable energy needs.</p>
<p>Using solar power, we can all play a part to save the environment. We can help the country become less dependent on outside energy sources. We can save money.</p>
<p>Comparing all the energy sources available to mankind today, solar power holds the greatest promise for solving many of our energy issues.</p>
<p>The sun gives out a huge amount of energy every single day. Only very small proportions of its energy reach the earth. Yet this is sufficient to supply the whole world with energy 35,000 times over at any given moment.</p>
<p>This means if we can tap into just 0.003 percent of the solar radiation we receive on earth, we can solve the world’s energy struggle. (And also solve many political strives caused by conflicting energy interests.)</p>
<p>Solar energy can certainly play an important role in your family. When you install photovoltaic panels (also known as solar panels) on your property, you can enjoy many benefits:</p>
<p>a.	You can save money on your monthly energy bills<br />
b.	Your property increases in value<br />
c.	You solar panels will eventually pay for themselves in the form of monthly energy savings, thus you’ll essentially own those solar panels for free.</p>
<p>In many places where it’s too expensive to run electrical cables, solar electricity becomes the cheapest form of electricity you can have.</p>
<p>Discover more about solar energy. You will be amazed how it can change your life in many ways.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Solar panels and solar waters heaters work well together. Just by installing such equipment, you are able to lower your utility bills by a huge percentage. You’ll also be helping the environment in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>While you are working on your solar panels or solar heaters, you can also explore other small projects that can make your house a better place to live in.</p>
<p>Here are some projects that take you less than a day to implement. And many of them are very helpful in lowering your energy bills as well.</p>
<p>Most of them do not cost more than $100+, so if you have a little time and a little cash, you can begin right away:</p>
<p><strong>1. Install solar screens</strong></p>
<p>Solar screens help to keep your house cool during summer. It prevents heat from coming into your house through the windows. As such, your air-conditioners will not need to work as hard.</p>
<p>Most solar screens are quite affordable. The best ones are those with a metallic, reflective surface. They reflect radiation away instead of absorbing it. They are also pretty durable.</p>
<p><strong>2. Solar ventilators</strong></p>
<p>Ventilators can be installed at your attic, powered by solar energy. During summer, you can activate these fans to pump the heat out of your interior. This alone can cool your house considerably.</p>
<p>All you need is a small fan, a small vent that comes with a cover and a small solar panel. You don’t even need rechargeable batteries. It stops working when it becomes dark, but you won’t need it at night.</p>
<p>Try it.</p>
<p>When the weather gets colder, remember to cover them properly so heat doesn’t escape through these vents.</p>
<p><strong>3. Solar powered air circulation</strong></p>
<p>When you heat up your house, warm air rises to the top. They are all trapped at the ceiling or attic. Heat is not distributed evenly. You can install a ceiling fan to push the heat down, or use solar power to pump warm air down to ground level.</p>
<p>The effect: Your home warms us faster and you’ll feel more comfortable.</p>
<p>For this project, you’ll need a small solar panel, a set of rechargeable batteries, a long pipe and a small exhaust fan.</p>
<p><strong>4. Landscaping</strong></p>
<p>Planting trees, scrubs and bushes around your house can give you many benefits. You will not only create a beautiful and rejuvenating environment&#8230; You can prevent bitter cold winds from blowing against your house in winter and shelter your house from strong sunshine during summer.</p>
<p><strong>5. Install solar light tubes</strong></p>

	<itunes:summary>Solar panels and solar waters heaters work well together. Just by installing such equipment, you are able to lower your utility bills by a huge percentage. You’ll also be helping the environment in meaningful ways.
While you are working on your solar panels or solar heaters, you can also explore other small projects that can make your house a better place to live in.
Here are some projects that take you less than a day to implement. And many of them are very helpful in lowering your energy bills as well.
Most of them do not cost more than $100+, so if you have a little time and a little cash, you can begin right away:
1. Install solar screens
Solar screens help to keep your house cool during summer. It prevents heat from coming into your house through the windows. As such, your air-conditioners will not need to work as hard.
Most solar screens are quite affordable. The best ones are those with a metallic, reflective surface. They reflect radiation away instead of absorbing it. They are also pretty durable.
2. Solar ventilators
Ventilators can be installed at your attic, powered by solar energy. During summer, you can activate these fans to pump the heat out of your interior. This alone can cool your house considerably.
All you need is a small fan, a small vent that comes with a cover and a small solar panel. You don’t even need rechargeable batteries. It stops working when it becomes dark, but you won’t need it at night.
Try it.
When the weather gets colder, remember to cover them properly so heat doesn’t escape through these vents.
3. Solar powered air circulation
When you heat up your house, warm air rises to the top. They are all trapped at the ceiling or attic. Heat is not distributed evenly. You can install a ceiling fan to push the heat down, or use solar power to pump warm air down to ground level.
The effect: Your home warms us faster and you’ll feel more comfortable.
For this project, you’ll need a small solar panel, a set of rechargeable batteries, a long pipe and a small exhaust fan.
4. Landscaping
Planting trees, scrubs and bushes around your house can give you many benefits. You will not only create a beautiful and rejuvenating environment… You can prevent bitter cold winds from blowing against your house in winter and shelter your house from strong sunshine during summer.
5. Install solar light tubes
Solar light tubes allow natural light to enter your house while keeping the heat and precipitation out. They cost a little more. But you can experience the benefits of full spectrum lighting in your room without expensive illumination technology.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pool solar panels are essentially heat exchangers that increase the water temperature of your pool using solar energy. Each heat exchanger (or heat collector) is lined with metallic pipes that run parallel to each other. They are always painted black, as this color is most efficient in absorbing heat, thus conversion of solar energy into heat is maximized.</p>
<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2187/2165958333_27d41c0fca.jpg"><img title="Pool Solar Panels | Pool Solar Heaters" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2187/2165958333_27d41c0fca.jpg" alt="Pool Solar Panels | Pool Solar Heaters" width="300" height="225" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Pool Solar Panels | Pool Solar Heaters</p></div>
<p>Solar heaters are also covered with a glass panel to act as a greenhouse, trapping heat within the enclosure. Since heat cannot escape through convection (due to glass), the only way of dissipation is through conduction. Fortunately the rate of conduction is much slower. Therefore most of the heat is retained.</p>
<p>How they work</p>
<p>Cold water runs into a heat exchanger and out comes warm water for your pool. This happens as the black-painted pipes absorb heat from the sunlight and transfer them to the water passing through. The surfaces of the heat collector box are also painted black and certainly helps warm up the air within. This, too, adds to the temperature of the water in the pipes.</p>
<p>The sunlight intensity, rate of water flow and diameter of pipes determine how hot the water will be. Generally, the thinner the pipes, the more efficient the heat transfer. This is because there is more surface area through which heat can be conducted from the pipe into the water.</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<p>Solar heaters rarely need any maintenance at all. They can also last many decades without significant wear and tear, provided it’s built and installed properly. Most importantly, solar heaters are cleaner and cheaper than gas and electric heaters.</p>
<p>The typically payback period of a pool solar panel is about 1 to 2 years, depending on the sunlight intensity and fuel costs.</p>
<p>Because solar heaters are very simple in design, they make very popular DIY projects. Homemade heaters will obviously cost much lesser than commercially made pool solar heaters. A typical heater may cost within the $4,000 price tag while a do-it-yourself solar heater often cost only a tenth of this price. Therefore the payback period is much shorter.</p>
<p>Installation</p>
<p>Installing a pool solar panel will not be a very tedious task. Most importantly, you should tilt your panels toward the south (if you are staying in the northern hemisphere) so that they can receive more sunlight throughout the year.</p>
<p>Other installation considerations include local building and insurance requirements as well as safety issues. An option is to have a qualified solar thermal contractor to install your solar heating panels for you. This will ensure quality.</p>
<p>With its simplicity, ease of installation and durability, pool solar heaters are getting more popular with consumers.

<div class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/71/192981092_f36e2613ff.jpg"><img title="How To Build Solar Panel" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/71/192981092_f36e2613ff.jpg" alt="How To Build Solar Panel" width="300" height="278" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">How To Build Solar Panel</p></div>
<p>In Part One, we’re going to take a look at the materials you need to build a successful project. In Part Two, you’ll learn how to put these parts together to form a complete system. Different applications certainly need different design considerations. We’ll cover how to modify your design to suit particular applications you have in mind. In Part Three, you’ll discover how to push your solar panel system up a notch so you’ll have a winner in your hands.</p>
<p>Before I go on to explain the different materials and components you need to build a solar panel, I must take some time to explain an important thought with you: you do not have to be an engineer of any sort to build a professional looking (and working) solar panel system.</p>
<p>You however need to know some basic soldering and this can be learned in a short span of 5 minutes…flat. You’ll also need to start your imagination engine so you’ll know how you’ll be using your solar panel to power your electrical devices.</p>
<p>In case you do not have any DIY skills at all, you can always buy ready-made solar panels complete with mounting brackets and connect the electrical wiring from there. This will be a little more expensive, of course.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the materials we need:</p>
<p>1. Solar Cells<br />
2. Plywood<br />
3. Jones Plug<br />
4. Silicone Caulk<br />
5. Super glue and screws<br />
6. Diode<br />

<p><strong>Solar Cells.</strong> Depending on your budget, you can either buy new cells or purchase slightly damaged ones. Yes, you can certainly put together broken solar cells. However if you’re not confident doing this, my best suggestion is to spend a little more money to buy new cells from eBay.</p>
<p><strong>Plywood.</strong> No matter how small your project is, unless you’re very skillful with woodworking, you’ll probably need 3/8” thick plywood. A very good idea that I came across is to use a sturdy photo frame (metallic or wooden one) and work from there. At least you don’t need to put in too much effort for the solar panel frame. You can get plywood easily from your local hardware store.</p>

<p><strong>Super glue and screws.</strong> Some super glue is useful to hold the pieces together before you screw them down firmly. Again, your local hardware shop probably sells super glue and screws.</p>
<p><strong>Wires.</strong> It is best to get those wires that come in a twisted pair of red and black so that you can be very sure of the polarity as you solder up the wires.</p>

The end result can be very fulfilling. Many hobbyists remarked that they spent only a fraction of what it would otherwise cost them had they bought a comparable solar power system.</p>
<p>It takes a little skill and practice to harvest components from pre-owned or broken solar panels. Yet it is not so difficult that you cannot manage it with basic DIY skills.</p>
<p>You have to free the photovoltaic cells from the base it’s mounted on. After you have done this, check the solar cells for loose connections, broken panels, condensation and damaged diodes. Common problems such as these can potentially cause your solar panels to break down shortly after installation.</p>
<p>If the joints between solar cells are broken or loose, you have to re-solder them. Malfunctioned diodes can be replaced with new ones from your local component store. And if you see broken photovoltaic cells, you will have to source for a similar component to replace it &#8212; this can be challenging. Yet you can still make do with the broken cell in case your efforts to replace the broken solar cell fail. There will be reduced power output as a result, but this is not a grave concern.</p>
<p>The array of solar cells is usually mounted on a piece of masonite or acrylic (substrate) board before it is placed into a new solar panel frame. You can discard this substrate after a few years if you intend to replace the solar cells with fresh, new ones.</p>
<p>Using pre-owned solar panels to build DIY solar panels has its pros and cons. The most obvious advantage is the price. Used solar panels can be very cheap and some kind contractors may even give them to you without asking for a single cent. You are also less worried about breaking expensive photovoltaic panels while building your project.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a used solar panel’s lifespan may be significantly shorter. Their power output will also be a little lower compared to when it was new. A loose connection or a fault may hide itself somewhere that escapes your attention. As you build your DIY solar panel, trouble may spring up from these areas. However this can be managed if you’re careful in checking for potential failures.</p>
<p>Overall, harvesting parts from a used solar panels proof to be the best money saving method to build DIY solar panels. The only downside is the additional effort you have to put in. Yet as DIY hobbyists, we tend to take joy in such labor.</p>

It takes a little skill and practice to harvest components from pre-owned or broken solar panels. Yet it is not so difficult that you cannot manage it with basic DIY skills.
You have to free the photovoltaic cells from the base it’s mounted on. After you have done this, check the solar cells for loose connections, broken panels, condensation and damaged diodes. Common problems such as these can potentially cause your solar panels to break down shortly after installation.
If the joints between solar cells are broken or loose, you have to re-solder them. Malfunctioned diodes can be replaced with new ones from your local component store. And if you see broken photovoltaic cells, you will have to source for a similar component to replace it — this can be challenging. Yet you can still make do with the broken cell in case your efforts to replace the broken solar cell fail. There will be reduced power output as a result, but this is not a grave concern.
The array of solar cells is usually mounted on a piece of masonite or acrylic (substrate) board before it is placed into a new solar panel frame. You can discard this substrate after a few years if you intend to replace the solar cells with fresh, new ones.
Using pre-owned solar panels to build DIY solar panels has its pros and cons. The most obvious advantage is the price. Used solar panels can be very cheap and some kind contractors may even give them to you without asking for a single cent. You are also less worried about breaking expensive photovoltaic panels while building your project.
On the other hand, a used solar panel’s lifespan may be significantly shorter. Their power output will also be a little lower compared to when it was new. A loose connection or a fault may hide itself somewhere that escapes your attention. As you build your DIY solar panel, trouble may spring up from these areas. However this can be managed if you’re careful in checking for potential failures.
Overall, harvesting parts from a used solar panels proof to be the best money saving method to build DIY solar panels. The only downside is the additional effort you have to put in. Yet as DIY hobbyists, we tend to take joy in such labor.

These factors are important. They ensure your solar panels receive maximum amount of solar energy through different seasons, especially winter, when there&#8217;s little sunlight. With maximum efficiency, solar collectors can be smaller. This means they take up less space and require a lower setup cost.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re living in the northern hemisphere, your solar collectors should be tilted southward. The tilt angle is 15 degrees plus the latitude of the installation site. This is the ideal configuration that allows you to collect maximum sunlight all year round. For example, Arizona has latitude of 33 degrees. Therefore the tilt angle of your panel should be 48 degrees in order for it to harness maximum energy.</p>
<p>But many homeowners choose to conform the tilt angle to the inclination of their roof. They are concerned about the aesthetics of the installation. Although we will not achieve an optimized configuration in an engineering point of view, such setup serves the user’s needs and wants after all.</p>
<p>Fortunately, solar collectors with tilt variations that fall within 20 degrees (either direction) will not suffer serious loss. In fact, tilting them some 15 degrees northward from its optimum angle can have its advantages. During summer, water will not overheat and during winter more hot water is produced.</p>
<p>Similarly, tilting your heat collectors southward (away from the optimum tilt angle) can result in more overheating during summer and less hot water during winter. Ideally, the tilt angle can be adjusted according to the seasons. But the hardware required to implement this setup may end up as an ugly structure of metal and joints that displease homeowners. There will also be more moving parts to be maintained.</p>
<p>When orientating your heat collectors, you should ideally point them to true south. As compared to photovoltaic panels, heat collectors are more forgiving. Orientations of 15 degrees off true south still enable solar collectors to receive most of the solar energy. Beyond this tolerance, the effectiveness of the heat collector decays quickly.</p>
<p>You may often be forced to make a choice between an east-biased or west-biased orientation away from true south. Perfect orientations tend to be impractical at times. If you’re in this fix, choose the west so heat collectors can be exposed to more heat as a result of higher ambient temperatures in the afternoons.</p>
<p>As you line up your compass to find true south, remember that it is pointing to magnetic south instead. Corrections must be made to locate the optimum orientation. To do this, you need to compensate for the magnetic declination of your site.</p>
<p>Finally, as you are evaluating the installation site, remember that shadows cause your heat collectors to be drastically less efficient. Although solar water heaters are not as sensitive to shading, it is good to place them in an open, unobstructed location from 9am to 3pm so they can be exposed to the maximum amount of sunshine during this critical period. Using a standard shade analysis tool like a solar pathfinder, you can make it easier for yourself to evaluate the shading condition of your location.</p>
