	<description>The Phone Losers of America and their prank calls have been on the web for more than 10 years now.  PLA has existed in many carnations, the latest being this podcast.  The show promises to entertain and inform with computer hacker and phone phreak themed tutorials, prank phone calls, songs, skits and parody commercials.  This comedy podcast has no regular schedule or format but so far has managed to put out a show at least every couple of weeks.  Be sure to visit the website for a complete archive of the PLA\&#039;s past 10 years of content.</description>

<p>Last week I went on a rampage against paper, throwing old documents away and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY-3f8_j6yE">offering you people a chance to take some of them for free</a>.  Today I&#8217;ve scanned in a bunch of these old PLA things and I&#8217;ve put them up on an archive page.  You can visit <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/media/documents/">phonelosers.org/media/documents</a> to browse the archive, or choose from a few of the options below.</p>
<p><UL><br />
<LI><a href="/media/documents/1994_letter_from_att_about_3rd_party_billing.jpg">AT&#038;T charges back some illegal 3rd party billing in 1994</a><br />
<LI><a href="/media/documents/1995_letter_from_att_about_3rd_party_billing.jpg">AT&#038;T charges back some illegal 3rd party billing in 1995</a><br />
<LI><a href="/media/documents/1995_volume_one_cassette_insert.jpg">PLA&#8217;s cassette before the first official album</a><br />
<LI><a href="/media/documents/phonelosers_flyer01.jpg">Lose weight on the phone phreaking diet!</a><br />
<LI><a href="/media/documents/1993_letter_from_att_about_coin_refunds.jpg">Dear RBCP, Stop asking for coin refunds.  Love, ATT</a><br />
<LI><a href="/media/documents/pla_order_bad_check.jpg">A guilt-ridden guy who purchased some 6.5536MHz crystals with a bad check sets things right with the PLA.</a><br />
</UL></p>
<p>Thanks, Laugh Track Matt, for convincing me that I should archive this stuff.  More things will be added as I find them.  All of these scanned documents are now sitting in a pile, waiting to be stuffed into random <a href="/store/">PLA Store</a> orders.  If you&#8217;d like to own a specific document, PayPal $1.00 for shipping to rbcp@phonelosers.org and let me know what you&#8217;d like me to send you.</p>
<p>I also scanned in other documents that were more personal, but some are loosely related to the PLA or weird phone things, such as <a href="http://www.notla.com/media/documents/1992_reconnecting_shonnas_phone_service.jpg">this letter where I reconnected a girl&#8217;s disconnected phone service</a>.  You can browse those documents at <a href="http://www.notla.com/media/documents/">notla.com/media/documents</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s yet another post to tell you to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/phonelosersofamerica">PLA&#8217;s YouTube videos</a>.  These two videos might interest you if you&#8217;ve been into the PLA for a long time.  Since I only have 8 months to live, I&#8217;m trying to give away tons of old PLA junk and photos.  The first video contains the junk and the 2nd one contains the photos.  Unfortunately a lot from the first video has already been taken, but most of the printed pages of stuff is still available.</p>

<p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rqCpmu5hptU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>Also on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/phonelosersofamerica">PLA&#8217;s YouTube</a> are 3 more episodes of Sorry I Dinged Your Car and a Geek Squad prank, which are all embedded below.  Apparently Geek Squad employees have been alerted to the video where we impersonate them because over 200 hits are coming from <a href="http://geeksquadcentral.com">geeksquadcentral.com</a>, which appears to be for employees only.  If any viewers have access to those forums, please send us some screen shots so we can find out whether they&#8217;re LOLing or plotting their revenge.</p>

<p>Wal-Mart doesn&#8217;t seem too happy with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBAve1x8-vo">our photo pranks</a>, according to the memo below.  This was spotted by a Wal-Mart employee who follows us on Facebook and was nice enough to snap a picture for us.  The memo has done little good, though, because photo employees still give us anything that we ask for.</p>
<p><center><a href="/images/2012/walmart_memo.jpg"><img src="/images/2012/walmart_memo_small.jpg"></a></center></p>
<p>Attached to this post is the latest episode of <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow">The Phone Show</a>, where you&#8217;ll find out what the word is if you listen long enough.  You can <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow/2012/06/05-29-2012-satanic-wargames/">click here</a> to read the show notes.  Don&#8217;t forget to listen to us live, every Tuesday night at 9pm Pacific / 12am Eastern.</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t that an amazing picture of the outline of a removed pay phone?  I took that last year at a gas station, just outside of Corvallis, Oregon.  Before they removed the empty pay phone stand, they were hanging advertising banners over the front of it.  Did you know it costs around <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/state-and-regional/company-wants-to-pull-small-town-pay-phones/article_c4b56ee3-396a-5e9a-a652-ad35dd57ea4f.html">$700 a year to maintain a pay phone</a>, even when that pay phone is only making a couple bucks a month?  These are the kind of useful facts you learn by <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow/">listening to The Phone Show</a> every Tuesday night at 9pm Pacific.</p>
<p>Have you people been to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/phonelosersofamerica">PLA YouTube page</a> lately?  I&#8217;ve been spending way too much time on there lately and I&#8217;ve uploaded a lot of videos recently, of new PLA material that you can&#8217;t find anywhere else.  Below I&#8217;m going to post a bunch of videos that I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve posted on phonelosers.org yet.  You are hereby required to watch every single one of them.</p>

<p>Have you watched them all?  Good job!  You&#8217;re not done yet, though.  You still need to watch <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hAJ-Y8HQsE&#038;feature=plcp">my video where I fail at hacking a cell phone</a> and then videos of me <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zAwdJQZ9nk&#038;feature=plcp">opening mail from El Gordo Uno</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4yJDdS_E2Y&#038;feature=plcp">opening mail from Laugh Track Matt</a>.</p>
<p>Oh, so you like videos of people opening mail?  That&#8217;s great, because lately PLA people have been on a rampage of sending each other random mail and then filming themselves opening boxes full of bizarre stuff.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5RH7TaKCik&#038;list=UU4p5Ji2JXI6UDVqGBlKuxTw&#038;index=7&#038;feature=plcp">Here&#8217;s a video of Trevor opening mail from me</a>, then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf5iFHrGEFc&#038;list=UU4p5Ji2JXI6UDVqGBlKuxTw&#038;index=6&#038;feature=plcp">opening mail from DS</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSZMYlH3iYY&#038;list=UU4p5Ji2JXI6UDVqGBlKuxTw&#038;index=2&#038;feature=plcp">then Laugh Track Matt</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNePpR9V05A&#038;list=UU4p5Ji2JXI6UDVqGBlKuxTw&#038;index=1&#038;feature=plcp">then Tristan</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izdnUIUkhVs&#038;feature=plcp">Here&#8217;s video of Laugh Track Matt opening mail from Tristan</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1SsAgE2PPA">here&#8217;s video of Evie opening a giant box from Tristan</a>.  Ugh, there&#8217;s no way I can post all of these so just go to <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=7058.0">this thread on the PLA Forums</a> and watch our giant collection of PLA unboxing videos.</p>
<p>Just as I did on the last phonelosers.org post, I&#8217;m attaching a recent episode of <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow/">The Phone Show</a> to this post for the podcast subscribers.  I don&#8217;t have any plans to do any new episodes of PLA Radio, but I&#8217;m sure one will happen eventually.  The Phone Show happens every week and there&#8217;s a separate podcast feed for that, plus all the YouTube videos are kind of in the old PLA Radio format of just being different collections of prank calls SO QUIT COMPLAINING!  Oh yeah, nobody was complaining.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Remember back on April 1st, when I <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/2012/04/design-a-pla-button-contest-2012-edition/">post about an amazing new button designing contest</a> where you could win your choice of prizes from the PLA store?  The first batch of entries are in and I&#8217;m here to judge them.  We&#8217;ll start with <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a>&#8216;s&#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/button_contest_rappy01.png"></center></p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/button_contest_rappy02.png"></center></p>
<p>Rappy was the only person to draw his buttons with ink pen and submit them via U.S. mail and that is why HE LOSES!  The rules clearly stated to <b>email them to me!</b>  You get NOTHING, Rappy!</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/button_contest_so0ty.png"></center></p>
<p>I may have awarded So0ty/Tristan with this month&#8217;s prize, but his McDonald&#8217;s logo spoof is clearly an attempt to get McDonald&#8217;s to sue me.  Not cool, especially after the incident with H4rl3y Dav1ds0n earlier this year.   Stick to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/so0tylol">making awesome YouTube videos for us</a>, So0ty!</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/button_contest_patch.png"></center></p>
<p>It looks like Patch used his 486 Pentium desktop machine with Windows 3.11 to design this one.  What, you couldn&#8217;t find a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=AT%26T+logo&#038;hl=en&#038;rlz=1C1LENN_enUS444US449&#038;prmd=imvnsz&#038;source=lnms&#038;tbm=isch&#038;ei=XKekT8L3B_HUiAKVuoXVAg&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=mode_link&#038;ct=mode&#038;cd=2&#038;ved=0CBkQ_AUoAQ&#038;biw=1517&#038;bih=725">good AT&#038;T logo to use</a>, Patch??  And did Windows Paint not have a center feature for text?  Go to the public library next time and use a real computer!</p>

<p>Forest claims that it only took him 5 minutes to throw the above button together, but I&#8217;m thinking he&#8217;s full of crap and he spent <i>days</i> in Photoshop, designing it.  Nice try, Forest!</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/button_contest_rhys.png"></center></p>
<p>Rhys seems to think that grouchy old man looks like a 1950&#8242;s housewife.  And did Mildred Monday ever use &#8220;I&#8217;m&#8221; to refer to herself?  I don&#8217;t think so.  Mildred is just like Lieutenant Commander Data &#8211; she never uses contractions.  Way to prove that you know absolutely nothing about PLA!  But I guess those, combined with the GO AWAY PLA button, make me like your set of buttons the best and I&#8217;m forced to award you the prize of anything you want from <a href="/store/">the PLA store</a>.</p>
<p><center><font size=6>CONGRATULATIONS, RHYS!</font></center></p>
<p>Send me your address and let me know what you&#8217;d like!  As for you other people &#8211; out of pity, I guess I&#8217;ll keep my word and send you the button that you designed, along with a couple other random buttons and maybe even an OBEY sticker if I&#8217;m feeling particularly nice.  So give me your addresses, everyone!  I want to add them to my giant notebook full of personal information on PLA people!</p>
<p>Thanks for the entries, everyone.  Keep them coming because I&#8217;m going to extend the contest through at least the next month.  I will announce a new winner on June 1st.  It&#8217;s an easy way to win a t-shirt if you&#8217;re too cheap to buy one, so open up your pirated copy of Photoshop and get started!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Remember back on April 1st, when I post about an amazing new button designing contest where you could win your choice of prizes from the PLA store?  The first batch of entries are in and I&#8217;m here to judge them.  We&#8217;ll start with Rappy McRapperson&#8216;s&#8230;


Rappy was the only person to draw his buttons with ink pen and submit them via U.S. mail and that is why HE LOSES!  The rules clearly stated to email them to me!  You get NOTHING, Rappy!

I may have awarded So0ty/Tristan with this month&#8217;s prize, but his McDonald&#8217;s logo spoof is clearly an attempt to get McDonald&#8217;s to sue me.  Not cool, especially after the incident with H4rl3y Dav1ds0n earlier this year.   Stick to making awesome YouTube videos for us, So0ty!

It looks like Patch used his 486 Pentium desktop machine with Windows 3.11 to design this one.  What, you couldn&#8217;t find a good AT&#038;T logo to use, Patch??  And did Windows Paint not have a center feature for text?  Go to the public library next time and use a real computer!

Forest claims that it only took him 5 minutes to throw the above button together, but I&#8217;m thinking he&#8217;s full of crap and he spent days in Photoshop, designing it.  Nice try, Forest!

Rhys seems to think that grouchy old man looks like a 1950&#8242;s housewife.  And did Mildred Monday ever use &#8220;I&#8217;m&#8221; to refer to herself?  I don&#8217;t think so.  Mildred is just like Lieutenant Commander Data &#8211; she never uses contractions.  Way to prove that you know absolutely nothing about PLA!  But I guess those, combined with the GO AWAY PLA button, make me like your set of buttons the best and I&#8217;m forced to award you the prize of anything you want from the PLA store.
CONGRATULATIONS, RHYS!
Send me your address and let me know what you&#8217;d like!  As for you other people &#8211; out of pity, I guess I&#8217;ll keep my word and send you the button that you designed, along with a couple other random buttons and maybe even an OBEY sticker if I&#8217;m feeling particularly nice.  So give me your addresses, everyone!  I want to add them to my giant notebook full of personal information on PLA people!
Thanks for the entries, everyone.  Keep them coming because I&#8217;m going to extend the contest through at least the next month.  I will announce a new winner on June 1st.  It&#8217;s an easy way to win a t-shirt if you&#8217;re too cheap to buy one, so open up your pirated copy of Photoshop and get started!

<p><center><a href="/images/2012/2012_tour_shirt_fake_back_dates.png"><img src="/images/2012/2012_tour_shirt_fake_back.png" alt="Back of shirt" border=0></a></center></p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a new PLA shirt that will become obsolete immediately after 2012 has passed.  Don&#8217;t miss out on this amazing opportunity to be obsolete before everyone else!  The front of the shirt has a white PLA bell on it and the back has a list of &#8220;tour dates&#8221; for important PLA locations, such as the Curtis L. Superhacker Arena and Roy&#8217;s Cactus Emporium.  If you show up at any of these places on the specified dates, you will win the prize!</p>
<p>The shirts will be in my hands and ready to mail at the end of April or maybe in the first week of May.  (The shirts above are Photoshopped &#8211; you can tell by the pixels.)  Don&#8217;t wait to buy these, though, because there is no guarantee that I&#8217;ll be printing any more of these.  (I might, if they sell quickly enough.)  I definitely won&#8217;t be printing any more of them after 2012, so this <b>will</b> be a collectors item worth millions by the time you&#8217;re dead.  This is a guarantee, so think of the $15.00 plus $5.00 for shipping you spend as an INVESTMENT.  No matter how bad the economy, your PLA shirt will go UP in value and your children will reap the rewards!  Quit being a bad parent (or future parent) and buy one NOW!</p>

Because of the numerous articles on phonelosers.org about <a href="/article/recording_telephone_calls/">recording phone calls</a> and <a href="/article/cna/">figuring out who owns a number</a> and other similar topics, I get a lot of bizarre emails from people.  I originally created the page on recording phone calls for the sole purpose of recording prank phone calls, but as you can see from the comments on that page, that&#8217;s rarely what the information is used for.  And last week, my latest email about identifying the owner of a phone number resulted in the following email:</p>
<p><center><br />
<table width=75% bgcolor=#000000>
<tr>
<td bgcolor=#ffffff>
To: Brad<br />
From: Josh</p>
<p>hey maybe yall could help me out seriously, cps has my friends daughter that was kidnapped when she was a baby by the dad that ended up in prison, now there trying to adopt her out saying tough shit basically. i have 2 of there numbers and the area there in, but there cell phones. was wondering if possable yall could drum up an address would be very helpful thanks drop me an email if yall could help out(address for the 2 cell numbers and a house number if possable to)
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p></center></p>
<p>These kind of messed-up emails are <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=905">very common for me</a> and I usually get at least one crazy email per month.  Usually it&#8217;s from wives wanting to spy on their husbands or parents wanting to spy on their teenagers for <b>having sex</b>, but this is the first one that made me feel like the guy was interested in using my site to kidnap his kids.  My first reaction, of course, was to be an complete asshole to the guy, so I responded with this&#8230;</p>
<p><center><br />
<table width=75% bgcolor=#000000>
<tr>
<td bgcolor=#ffffff>
To: Josh<br />
From: Brad</p>
<p>When you say &#8220;now there trying to adopt her out&#8221; you should be using the contraction version of &#8220;they are&#8221; which is &#8220;they&#8217;re.&#8221;  So you would actually type &#8220;Now they&#8217;re trying to adopt her out.&#8221;  When in doubt on that one, it&#8217;s best to just say &#8220;Now they are trying to adopt her out&#8221; which sounds kind of robotic, but at least you don&#8217;t appear as dumb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have 2 of there numbers and the area there in, but there cell phones&#8221; is also incorrect.  On the first one, you should indicate possession by stating &#8220;I have 2 of their numbers&#8221; and in the second instance it&#8217;s another contraction of &#8220;they are.&#8221;  The third use is also a contraction of &#8220;they are&#8221; but it seems to flow better if you just use &#8220;they are&#8221; instead of &#8220;they&#8217;re&#8221; so the full sentence should be typed as follows:</p>
<p>I have 2 of their numbers and the area they&#8217;re in, but they are cell phones.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very glad I could help you.<br />

<p>I posted his email and my reply on Facebook for us all to laugh at, deleted the email and figured that would be the end of it.  Unless, of course, I got a hilarious reply, which I never did.  Sudo soon convinced me, though, that I should actually do something about this guy being so sketchy about needing his kid&#8217;s address.  I mean, there&#8217;s gotta be a reason CPS took the parents away from the kids, right?</p>
<p>So Sudo emailed the guy back and said she&#8217;d be happy to help him identify the phone numbers as long as he promised that nothing illegal would happen with the information she gave him.  The guy responded with two phone numbers, promising that &#8220;no1 will be harased&#8221; and that he just needed the information for his records.  We were totally convinced!  </p>
<p>Sudo immediately called up one of the numbers and had a chat with the guy who was in possession of the kids.  He told her a few crazy stories about the guy who sent the emails that included hacked Facebook accounts and restraining orders and he was really happy to hear that we were looking out for him.  He asked her to forward him copies of the guy&#8217;s emails for him to show to attorneys or cops or something.</p>
<p>After forwarding the emails to the guy and telling him how happy I was that that the kid would be raised in a home that respected the rules of basic grammar, I immediately resumed Asshole Mode again and drafted an email for Sudo to send back to the original guy with the results of our search on the phone numbers he gave us.  Our lengthy reply included the address of his local police department as the physical address on both of the phone numbers.  Hopefully that will result in some kind hilarity or at least a few angry emails from the guy.  Keep watching this thread for updates!</p>
<p>To read some similar emails from crazy parents and spouses, <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=905">visit this thread in the PLA Forums</a> where you can read emails and replies.  In some of them, the person&#8217;s address is included so you can even give your own helpful replies to them.  Thanks for giving me a small taste of morality, Sudo!  If only you&#8217;d been there for me in Christmas of &#8217;96&#8230;</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve visited the <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/store/buttons/">PLA Store</a> in the past 4 decades, you&#8217;ve probably noticed the buttons for sale.  Many of these buttons were designed by PLA forum members in a  <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=637.0">2006 contest</a> that lasted for 23 years.  I&#8217;m starting up the contest again, only with bigger and better prizes!</p>
<p>This time, not only will I send your button to you, plus a few extra buttons of your choice, but I&#8217;ll also pick a winner at the end of each month to receive any item they want from the PLA Store.  A shirt, a book, a CD, or whatever other crappy thing we&#8217;re currently hawking in an attempt to get rich.  I even have some items that aren&#8217;t in the store anymore, such as coffee mugs, that you can choose from.</p>
<p><UL><br />
<LI>You can send me as many entries as you want.  You&#8217;ll either send them directly to rbcp@phonelosers.org, or just post them in <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=7025.0">this thread</a>.<br />
<LI>Entries should have something to do with the PLA, no matter how obscure.<br />
<LI>I will send most people the buttons that they design.  I will choose which ones not to send out, such as the ones that are just random images poorly slapped together or text that could never possibly be read on a 1&#8243; button.  I will publicly ridicule the really bad entries this time instead of being nice and mailing them out.<br />
<LI>If multiple entries in a certain month are especially awesome, I just might pick two people to receive PLA crap.<br />
<LI>Many entries will become a part of the PLA Store.  Others won&#8217;t go in the store, but will be regularly given out along with other merchandise that&#8217;s ordered.  You won&#8217;t be compensated, other than to receive a few free buttons and possibly the monthly prize.  You can rest easy, knowing that my buttons profits are always negative because I give tons of them away with orders.<br />
<LI>Yes, I&#8217;m posting this contest on April 1st, no this contest isn&#8217;t an April Fools Day joke.<br />
<LI>No, a part of the April Fools joke is not to say that it isn&#8217;t a joke even though it really is.<br />
<LI>GOD, JUST <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=637.0">LOOK AT THE OLD CONTEST PAGE</a> IF YOU DON&#8217;T BELIVE ME!<br />
</UL></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made some templates to get you started on designing PLA buttons.  If you&#8217;d like to make a small button, then use <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/images/design_small_button.jpg">this template</a>.  If you&#8217;d like to make a large button, then use <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/images/design_large_button.jpg">this template</a>.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.phonelosers.org/images/order_buttons_chotchkies2.jpg"></center></p>
<p><center>Ready, set, GO!</center></p>

<p><i><font size=2>The following article and pictures are taken from the July 1982 issue of Playboy magazine which featured nekkid pics of Bell workers.  You can click on any of the pictures in this post to see the full sized NAKED pictures.  If you are under the age of 18, be sure to show the pictures to your parents after you look at them and tell them that the PLA told you to view them all.  I didn&#8217;t include all of the pictures from the article since there were no phones in them, and I&#8217;ve painstakingly typed out the entire article since that&#8217;s the important part of Playboy magazine.  In conclusion, porn sucked in the 80&#8242;s.</font></i></p>
<p>She&#8217;s a friend in the phone, a modulated, mildly mysterious voice at the other end of a piece of plastic and miles of copper wire.  Every guy who&#8217;s ever dropped a coin in the slot has pictured her.  She&#8217;s bright, of course, and understanding and as finely formed as a Princess phone.  She&#8217;s the one Jim Croce wrote a song to but never got to see.  Well, we&#8217;ve traced her, just to prove she really exists.  And the result of our finger-flattening telephone survey is this listing of spectacular numbers currently in service &#8211; ten women who offer the kind of tone you&#8217;d like to reach out and touch.</p>
<p>Each of Ma Bell&#8217;s daughters is cool, alert under pressure &#8211; what you&#8217;d call collected.  But she&#8217;s not know for patience.  Operators are encouraged to answer your ring in three seconds and say goodbye in 29.  So you don&#8217;t want to put even a long-distance relationship with her on hold; you&#8217;re liable to get a busy signal or even be disconnected.</p>
<p>Not all the women of Ma Bell are operators.  Many are supervisors or managers or communications technicians.  Some are linepersons &#8211; a title they&#8217;re not entirely happy with, since &#8220;Wichita lineperson&#8221; has no ring to it at all.  (The sight of a good-looking lineperson shinnying up a telephone pole, however, does give rise to new and unusual Freudian imagery.  Think about it.</p>
<p><center><a href="/images/2012/playboy02.jpg"><img src="/images/2012/playboy02_small.jpg"></a></center><br />
<font size=1>Above is a switch for the bored operator &#8211; a switchboard striptease by Santa Ana, California&#8217;s Laurie Page, who works for Pacific Telephone.  Early operators all wore long black skirts and white blouses.  Today, they have to move fast to handle 150 calls an hour, so dress is optional.  Click the picture to see the other shots.</font></p>
<p>Before any of you gentleman callers gets to meet the girls, an introduction to the family is in order.  Pa Bell, known to Ma as Alexander Graham (the 19th Century was a formal time), wrought the Bell Telephone Company in 1877, a year after he invented the apparatus itself.  He was listed as the company&#8217;s &#8220;electrician.&#8221;  A man who liked to sound jaunty and nautical, he would pick up the mouthpiece and say, &#8220;Ahoy,&#8221; which made a lot of callers think they were already talking on the transatlantic cable.</p>
<p><a href="/images/2012/playboy04.jpg"><img src="/images/2012/playboy04_small.jpg" align=right></a>Bell&#8217;s baby boomed to become the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the largest corporation in the world.  Today, it employs more than 1,000,000 people and makes $11,000 a minute.  It spins out enough copper wire every year to wrap around the world 2300 times.  And it operates 138,000,000 phones.  Twenty-five thousand of them are in the Pentagon (for a monthly bill of $725,000, even with discount).  There are 12 cities in the country, including Washington, D.C., and Skokie, Illinois, with more phones than <i>people</i>.</p>
<p>Ma Bell kept wrapping the world with phone lines and feathering her bed with money until last January, when the Justice Department decided to reach out a crush someone.  That someone was Ma.  The Attorney General&#8217;s troops pulled the plug on two thirds of the company&#8217;s assets; soon AT&#038;T will have to spin off all of its local operations into locally run companies.  We have some suggestions:  Southwestern Bell, for example, might become the independent Taco Bell.  The Philadelphia phone company might become Liberty Bell, and all the phones at Disneyland might be run by Tinker Bell.  But Ma is sure to get over what may be a wild Bell hiccup.  In fact, if the divestiture turns out the way analysts think it will, most of her shareholders will be better off, probably considering themselves saved by the Bell.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve faced the family, greet the girls.</p>
<p>Meet Vicki Vittorio from Columbus, Ohio, for instance; she answers to the numbers 36-25-35.  Vicki&#8217;s a communications technician who was amazed at all the equipment she had to work with when she went to work for Ohio Bell three years ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;The compexity of what&#8217;s involved in one circuit is amazing,&#8221; says Vicki.  &#8220;I use meters to check on telephone circuits.  I listen over my headset for the various kinds of signals that come over the circuits, and I&#8217;ve also done some wiring.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, doing that for Bell really can be electrifying &#8211; now and then, an office joker will shout at Vicky, using one of those orange road-safety cones as a megaphone, or even touch a low-voltage wire to her.  &#8220;That live wire won&#8217;t really hurt you,&#8221; she says, &#8220;but it can make you angry for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p><center><a href="/images/2012/playboy03.jpg"><img src="/images/2012/playboy03_small.jpg"></a></center></p>
<p>Ma doesn&#8217;t have to put on the red light for Roxanne Laube, a service representative who deals with customer complaints in Chicago.  Roxanne&#8217;s the one who, among other things, gives the green light to trace long-winded obscene callers in the Windy City.</p>
<p>&#8220;I talk to crazies every day,&#8221; sighs Roxanne.  &#8220;The only way to complain to the phone company is to talk to somebody like me.  But one of the most fulfilling things I do is help trap the lines and resolve obscene-caller cases.&#8221;</p>
<p>As for filial affection on the part of Ma&#8217;s employees, Roxanne believes that &#8220;most employees are loyal, but I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d say they feel affection for the company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Employees feel flattered and lucky to work for the phone company,&#8221; is the way Bridgeport, Connecticut, customer clerk Judy Perkins sees the situation.  &#8220;But to tell the truth, I haven&#8217;t met anyone who feels true affection.  I, for one, find it difficult to feel emotional toward any large corporation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judy sells such services and products as extra lines and push-button phones for the Southern New England Telephone Company.  &#8220;It&#8217;s tough to break in here; the company has a reputation for being good to workers and offering diversified opportunities.  But there&#8217;s been a change since deregulation &#8211; employees feel real concern for the corporation and their place in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Judy works in a small ofice staffed only by women.  It&#8217;s not easy to get in touch with her at work, but here&#8217;s a hint:  &#8220;I&#8217;d be especially charmed,&#8221; she says, &#8220;by a handwritten invitation to a romantic picnic lunch.&#8221;  The box-lunch retailers of New England should be thrilled to hear that.</p>
<p>While AT&#038;T is a publisher in it own right (it publishes 120,000,000 phone books a year, on almost a billion pounds of paper), it has yet to put out a directory with a centerfodl.  So you might assume its employees would be a little daunted by stripping more than wires for Playboy.  The ladies we talked with say anyone who thinks that is barking up the wrong pole.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been no problem,&#8221; Vicki Vittorrio tells us.  &#8220;I think deep down, most women wonder what posing for Playboy would be like &#8211; they&#8217;d like to see themselves as sexy.  As far as I&#8217;m concerened, it&#8217;s an honor to be selected.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vicki has a Seoul sister in Lana Crandal, a Pacific Northwest Bell reports clerk in Portland, Oregon, who is a native of South Korea&#8217;s capital.  &#8220;It was just fun,&#8221; opines Lana, a free-lance graphics designer who admits she prefers her sideline to AT&#038;T&#8217;s power lines.  &#8220;It was a good experience.  Now everyone&#8217;s looking at me in the office and I&#8217;m starting to hear stories all the time, but it doesn&#8217;t bother me &#8211; at least, not until the other girls start summing me up.&#8221;</p>
<p><center><a href="/images/2012/playboy05.jpg"><img src="/images/2012/playboy05_small.jpg"></a></center></p>
<p>But leave it to Judy Perkins to express a Bell belle&#8217;s essential attitude toward this conference call between Ma Bell and Playboy: Being part of the business world, I sometimes feel stereotyped as a conservative office worker.  Posing for Playboy gives me an opportunity to reveal other aspects of my well-rounded personality.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve called them as we&#8217;ve seen them.  All in all, we think the women of Ma Bell would make Ma proud.  They&#8217;re free of hangups.  They have the best long lines in the field.  And each of them has a <i>voice</i> sultry enough to keep a caller&#8217;s pockets packed with dimes.  Whether or not they work at switchboards, these have to be the smoothest operators in the business.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years ago, Altalp from the <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com">PLA Forums</a> made a bizarre post about buying a Vonage router from her local Wal-Mart, replacing the circuit board inside with a <b>turkey sandwich</b> and then returning it to Wal-Mart for a full refund.  She posted a bunch of pictures with her story, demonstrating all the steps she took to ensure that nothing would seem amiss when she returned a turkey sandwich for a refund.</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.phonelosers.org/images/2012/vonage09.jpg"></center></p>
<p>&#8220;I needed something lightweight and wouldnt rattle around inside if inspected. I couldnt find anything that would work.  Either things were too heavy, not large enough, or too tall. I then noticed my turkey sammich sitting next to me. I picked it up and weighed it in my hand.  It was just right.  I placed the case over my sammich and cut out the outline in it. Then took a couple bites to make room for the jacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>Altalp had no problems returning the device and even made $20 extra by filling out the rebate card.  I&#8217;m not trying to encourage people to do this sort of thing, of course, because it&#8217;s a pretty horrible thing to do. But the idea of replacing a Vonage router with a turkey sandwich sounded exactly like the sort of random comment Zak would make, like the time he claimed to an operator that a vandal had replaced his telephone handset with a bologna sandwich, only Altalp actually <i>did</i> it!</p>
<p>Thanks for the story and the pictures, Altalp!  <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=3121.0">Click here</a> if you&#8217;d like to see Altalp&#8217;s full post from 2008, complete with details and pictures.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a new technology that some of you may have heard of by now, called &#8220;compact discs,&#8221; which you can now purchase to listen to a tiny portion of our prank phone calls.  We&#8217;re pretty sure these are the next big thing, so get ready to start re-purchasing all that music you&#8217;ve been buying as mp3 files these past few years.  Anyway, a brand new PLA CD, titled &#8220;Can I Help You?&#8221; is <a href="http://kunaki.com/sales.asp?PID=PX00Z75RV2&#038;pp=1">now available for you to buy</a>.  This CD features calls by <a href="http://www.murd0c.net">murd0c</a>, <a href="http://www.madhouselive.com">Carlito from Madhouse</a>, <a href="http://www.notla.com">RBCP</a> and The Spessas.  You&#8217;ll get to hear about 73 minutes of our customer service calls from the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Yes, these calls are all available already on our website and from the <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/2011/09/the-pla-media-torrent-2011-edition-is-up/">PLA Media Pack torrent</a>.  You won&#8217;t be getting anything new or unavailable by buying this CD, aside from a cool CD with original artwork on it.  If you want to download the full album for free, <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/media/pla_can_i_help_you.zip">click here</a>.  If people like the CD and buy enough of them, that will motivate me to put together a few more of them soon.  I&#8217;m mainly making these for the same reason I made the newer <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/2011/10/pla-the-complete-zine-collection-book/">PLA &#8216;zine archive book</a> &#8211; because some people will think this sort of thing is neat to have.</p>

<p><center><img src="/images/2012/futurama.png"></center></p>
<p>Thanks, whoever made that Futurama photo.  I think it was Trevor, but I&#8217;m probably wrong.  Speaking of Trevor, though, he uploaded Tabachi&#8217;s billions of edited prank calls from our 24-hour prank call marathon <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/xBonkerz1">to YouTube</a> a few days ago, denying my request to leave out the one where I made a girl cry.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/PLA-Marathon-2012/276167095779803">Click here to join the 2012 Marathon Facebook page</a>, which I assume will eventually contain information about next year&#8217;s 24-hour prank call marathon.  (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoAq63-B3mg">Click here to watch my video of Trevor&#8217;s videos</a>.)</p>
<p>Are you a Pinterest user?  Wow, so am I!  <a href="http://pinterest.com/bradthecarter/phone-losers-of-america/">Here&#8217;s my board for the Phone Losers of America</a>.  I doubt you&#8217;ll see any updates on there that you haven&#8217;t seen on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/phonelosers">PLA&#8217;s Facebook</a> first, but you never know.</p>
<p>One last thing &#8211; because I&#8217;m incapable of making a post without mentioning <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a> these days, I should mention that he visited my house last week and he accidentally left a bunch of his stuff behind so I created a blog called <a href="http://rappycomics.blogspot.com/">Comics From Space</a> where I will display scans of the pile of drawings I have here, before throwing them in the trash.  Starting next week, I will begin selling articles of his clothing on eBay.  Also, me and him put together a pretty good music video for a song from his new album, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VO7lihuY3c">Punch The Wall</a>.  I&#8217;ve embedded it below.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/6VO7lihuY3c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p><b>ONE MORE LAST THING:</b> <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow">The Phone Show is tonight!</a>  9pm Pacific.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, I was having a nice romantic dinner with <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a> at <a href="http://www.redrobin.com/banzailoveyou/">Red Robin</a>, and we noticed an advertisement on the table encouraging everyone to tweet with the hashtag of <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23banzailoveyou">#banzailoveyou</a> to win free meals and other prizes.  Rappy, who was clearly a victim of my bad influence over the past few days, immediately suggested that we tweet something horrible about Red Robin, using their hashtag.  A few moments later, using all 3 of my Twitter accounts on my smartphone and then Rappy&#8217;s, the following twats were posted.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou01.jpg"></center></p>
<p>Now, I have nothing against Red Robin and I think their food is awesome.  I eat there with my kids and my friends several times a year and have had nothing but great experiences there.  So please, don&#8217;t think that my tweets are out of retaliation for poor service or rude staff.  Red Robin is a great place and I highly recommend them to everyone that reads this.  I&#8217;m just an asshole, though, and I think the idea of writing horrible things about them is hilarious.  So I started <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=6933.0">a thread on the PLA Forums</a>, encouraging others to join in the fun and tweet crazy things.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou02.jpg"></center></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that these first few tweets have two i&#8217;s in the hashtag.  This apparently is incorrect, as you&#8217;ll see on the official contest page, but I swear there were two i&#8217;s on the card we saw on the table.  I had to look at it each time I made a new tweet from the restaurant and there&#8217;s just no way I made the exact same mistake all three times.  Legitimate customers were <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23banzaiiloveyou">tweeting with 2 i&#8217;s too</a>, so it&#8217;s not just me.  No really!</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou03.jpg"></center></p>
<p>Right around here is when things got completely out of control.  Our wacky tweets are now outnumbering the legitimate contest tweets.  Prepare yourself for a gigantic list of hilarious tweets, all by people who noticed our tweets and began writing things 500 times more awesome than we could come up with.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou04.jpg"></center><br />
<center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou05.jpg"></center><br />
<center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou06.jpg"></center><br />
<center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou07.jpg"></center><br />
<center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou08.jpg"></center><br />
<center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou09.jpg"></center><br />
<center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou10.jpg"></center><br />
<center><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou11.jpg"></center></p>
<p>As all of these hilarious tweets were coming in yesterday, keeping me and Rappy LOLing most of the day, <a href="http://www.madhouselive.com">Carlito</a> began messaging me from a Red Robin in Pennsylvania.  He just happened to be eating there and managed to get an awesome picture of him and the Red Robin mascot.  Then he sent me the picture of his Banzai burger, which you saw at the beginning of this post.  </p>
<p><img src="/images/2012/banzailoveyou_carlito_meets_red_robin.jpg" align="right">Having pictures coming in from Carlito as all of these tweets were happening just added to the hilarity for me and Rappy.  The tweets are still continuing today and show no sign of slowing down yet.  So a ton of thanks goes out to all the people who&#8217;ve given us nonstop lulz these past 48 hours.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to say you all should continue doing this, but the contest does last for another month, until February 19th, and it sure is making a lot of people laugh.  We&#8217;re fairly certain that even the Red Robin corporate people are snickering about it in their corporate meetings (you guys are welcome for that!).  If you&#8217;d like to enter Red Robin&#8217;s contest, all you have to do is follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/redrobinburgers">@redrobinburgers</a> and then tweet something (the contest rules don&#8217;t specify what should be tweeted) with the hashtag of <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23banzailoveyou">#banzailoveyou</a>.  You can read all about the contest at <a href="http://www.redrobin.com/banzailoveyou/">redrobin.com/banzailoveyou</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, RED ROBIN IS AWESOME!  Don&#8217;t believe any of the craziness that you&#8217;ve read above.  Well, except for the part about the staff stealing my wallet and shooting my wife in the foot &#8211; that shit is totally true.  If our silliness is making you laugh, though, then you should definitely go eat some overpriced food at the Red Robin nearest you.  </p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a> for making this happen and to Carlito from <a href="http://www.madhouselive.com">Madhouse Live</a> for the pictures.  Most of all, thanks to all the Twitter users that have given me and us other PLA&#8217;ers lots of hysterical laughter these past 48 hours!</p>

<p><b>January 17th Update!</b> Just a day after posting this entry on phonelosers.org, Red Robin suddenly began heavily promoting their Banzai Burger contest by emailing people on their mailing list and encouraging them to tweet with #banzailoveyou.  They also began constantly tweeting, &#8220;Put your tweets where your mouth is. Head to Red Robin, enjoy a Banzai Burger &#038; Tweet the love! #BanzaiLoveYou&#8221; to get people to respond with the hashtag.  As a result, our crazy tweets have been quickly scrolling away for days now, making it pointless to even do it anymore.  Well played, Red Robin.  Well played.</p>
<p>Another odd thing &#8211; when we started doing this, the description on the <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/redrobinburgers">Red Robin Twitter account</a> had the name of the guy who ran it.  As in, the personal name of the guy in their public relations department, or whoever runs it in corporate Red Robin Land.  But as soon as they started fighting back at us, his name disappeared from the description.  Now it just says &#8220;Official Home of Insanely Delicious Gourmet Burgers.&#8221;  We&#8217;re not sure if taking the name off had anything to do with us, but we&#8217;re going to pretend it did because we&#8217;re such scary people and he just didn&#8217;t want any trouble.</p>

<p>Happy 2012, everyone!  It&#8217;s time to start your year with a brand new episode of the PLA Radio podcast!  This episode tells you all about our adventures of irritating Target shoppers during the 2011 holiday season.

Dear Arby,<br />
i got in touch with you a while ago about becoming a affiliate with the PLA site because im in the first steps of starting <a href="http://www.theoctoshow.com/">my own show/site</a>. im new to phone pranking really and im still trying to find my bearings with everything. but one of the things that has become an issue for me and my cohort for the site is the legality of prank calling. ive read a lot on the site and in your book and i know you have had some troubles from calling people. so im wondering what pointers you can share that generally keeps the law off your ass. i know in california it becomes harassment if the calls exceeds 4 calls in a 2 week span, but really i need helpful advice from someone who has been at it for long enough to know whats what. also, how do you record calls without problems? oh and i remember you referencing a kind of code of ethics that the PLA stands behind, i would like to follow that so a rundown would be very helpful in these first times with getting content for the site.</p>
<p>also, i have a fiend who runs an embroidery company out of her home and i was wondering if you would be interested in making some sew on PLA patches. you have buttons, shirts, hats and books so something else that can have the PLA logo would be awesome! it would also bring some well needed incoming orders for my friend. im thinking about having her make one and send you a picture of it if it would help.</p>
<p>Love,<br />

<p>Hi Chris!  I&#8217;m far from being a lawyer or a cop, so keep that in mind when listening to my legal advice.  A few months ago, I wrote <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/2011/07/how-to-make-a-prank-phone-call/<br />
">an article on how to keep prank calls legal</a>, which should answer most of your legal questions about prank calling.  Basically, it says that you should never prank locally, you shouldn&#8217;t make threats, you shouldn&#8217;t impersonate government employees and you shouldn&#8217;t prank someone more than a couple of times.  I really need to add that article to the sidebar of this site so that people can easily find it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also written <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/article/recording_telephone_calls/">an article on how to record phone calls</a>, which mostly deals with cellular phones and land lines.  I need to update that page to include Skype recording, because Skype is about the only thing I ever use anymore for prank calling.  I don&#8217;t even know how to begin to explain how I have things set up in the Cacti Radio studio, but it involves broadcasting software, a mixer and 2 sound cards hooked together in a loop that should explode the universe, but doesn&#8217;t.  When I&#8217;m not on the air, though, I use <a href="http://voipcallrecording.com/">mp3 Skype Recorder</a>, which is a free program that automatically records all of your Skype calls.  It sucks and it has issues and I will replace it one of these days when I feel like testing out other options, but for now it does the job.  Sort of.</p>
<p>Finally, about your friend who makes embroidered stuff &#8211; tell her I would love for her to make a ton of PLA shit!  Here&#8217;s the thing about PLA merchandise &#8211; I make barely any money at all from it.  In fact, between all the time I spend packaging things up and driving to the post office and all the free stuff I include with orders and all the PLA stuff that I give away because I&#8217;m such a nice guy, I&#8217;m sure I lose money in the end.  Luckily, phonelosers.org supports itself with the advertisements on this page, so I don&#8217;t really lose money at PLA.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m getting at, though &#8211; I would like your friend to make any cool things she can think of that would be related to the PLA.  She can use <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/images/logos/pla_logo_1000px_color.png">the PLA logo</a> or PLA quotes or cacti or anything she wants.  She can send me links to things she makes and I will help her sell them, using phonelosers.org and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/phonelosers">PLA Facebook</a> page.  And here&#8217;s the best part &#8211; she can charge whatever she wants and keep all the profits for herself!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/thesamantha">Samantha</a> had this great idea a month or two ago &#8211; she wanted to knit things with PLA symbols on them, such as gloves or hats or whatever.  I loved the idea and told her to go for it, but knowing how lazy Samantha is, I immediately set about creating a competitive market for her knitting by contacting random <a href="http://www.etsy.com">ETSY</a> shop owners and suggesting to them that they make PLA things and sell them.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2011/cell_phone_cozy_small.jpg" align=left> The image you see here is the first result of that.  This is a cell phone cozy, made by <a href="http://www.etsy.com/people/knitworld">MarikaHandKnits</a> in Toronto.  She makes custom party wristbands, fingerless gloves, iphone cases and more.  Ideally, the etsy owner would put the item up for sale so that I could link people to it and they could easily buy it, but for whatever reason, this shop owner didn&#8217;t do that and didn&#8217;t tell me how much this cell phone cozy costs, so all I can do is tell readers to <a href="<br />
http://www.etsy.com/shop/knitworld?ref=pr_shop_more">visit her shop</a> and ask to buy the PLA cell phone cozy.</p>
<p>I would like for everyone to do this!  If you know someone who makes things and sells it on sites like etsy.com, tell them to make PLA things!  I want to see PLA hats, gloves, sweaters and underwear!  I can&#8217;t guarantee that anyone will buy these things, but I will do my best to link to their PLA merchandise from this site.  I&#8217;d like to even set up a section on the <a href="/store/">PLA Store page</a> for things that other people make.  Do this, people!</p>
<p>Thanks for the email, Chris!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notla.com">RBCP</a></p>

<p>But my secret ulterior motive for posting this today is to tell everyone that <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a> is having his album release party on Cacti Radio this Saturday!

You can preorder an autographed physical CD at <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">rappymcrapperson.com</a> or you can just steal the album from the internet when it comes out on Saturday.  </p>

<p>Holy crap, it&#8217;s Christmas!  Do you want a Christmas gift?  I want to give you a Christmas gift, so here&#8217;s the deal&#8230;<a href="mailto:rbcp@phonelosers.org">email me your address</a> and I&#8217;ll give you a <a href="/store/buttons/">special PLA button</a> that you&#8217;ve never seen before.  I&#8217;ve never seen it either, because I just thought of this dumb idea, but chances are it will be holiday-themed and it might have a cactus on it or a PLA bell or some boobs or something.  You know you want one.  </p>
<p>This offer is good until the end of December 2011 and just so it doesn&#8217;t get out of hand, I&#8217;m going to limit this to just the first 50 people who email me.  One per person, please.  If I reach the limit of 50, I will post here that I&#8217;m out of them.</p>
<p>If you want to get yourself a nice Christmas present, I suggest buying a <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/2011/11/pla-harley-shirts-are-back/">PLA Harley shirt</a> or anything else from the <a href="/store/">PLA store</a> as soon as possible so you get it by Christmas.</p>
<p>Happy holidays, everyone!</p>
<p>Hugs and kisses,<br />

<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trevOrDragon">Trevor</a> became the first person on Earth to declare &#8220;PLA 4 LYFE!&#8221; by having a PLA bell logo tattooed on <strike>his butt</strike> his arm.  Those of you who hang out on <a href="http://www.tinychat.com/cactuscactus">PLA&#8217;s Tinychat</a> often enough have probably run across Trevor, also known as rasterdragon, from time to time.  Trevor often runs <a href="/movienight/">PLA Movie Night</a> whenever RBCP is too strung-out to do it himself.</p>
<p>Trevor will undoubtedly be cursing PLA&#8217;s name 10 years from now as he&#8217;s paying exorbitant amounts of money to have PLA&#8217;s logo lasered off his arm.  If he&#8217;s smart about it, he will sue RBCP for corrupting his mind enough to let this instant of bad decision making happen.  If you&#8217;d like to learn more about someone who would desecrate their body with our ridiculousness, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/trevOrDragon">visit Trevor on Facebook</a>, <a href="http://rasterdragon.tumblr.com">then look at more tattoo pictures on his tumblr</a> and <a href="http://rasterdragon.info">be confused about his .info page</a>. Trevor also runs <a href="http://mcrapperson.com">his own Rappy McRapperson page</a> to confuse people trying to <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">find the real one</a>.</p>

<p>Not since <a href="/2011/09/dear-arby-volume-1/">Dear Arby Volume 1</a> have I made a post with so many letters to&#8230;me.  In this edition you&#8217;re going to see an exciting array of the things that have arrived in my P.O. box, which is my sad an obvious attempt to cause more things to show up in my P.O. box.  </p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/dear_arby_postcard_home.jpg"></center></p>
<p>The above postcard is a good example of how I would prefer people <i>not</i> send me mail &#8211; by tracking down my home address and sending a &#8220;I FOUND YOU&#8221; card to my home without a signature.  Quit it!  Use the P.O. Box, please.</p>
<p>A guy named z09 was a regular on the <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com">PLA Forums</a> and the inspiration for the Blockbuster episode of PLA Radio.  He was also really into stalking me using the methods he learned from phonelosers.org.  He loved sending me pizzas and taxis and even talked my local Blockbuster Video out of my account information.  He once sent lunchmeat to me and Countykid in the mail, and soon after that he sent me this letter with a $20 bill enclosed.</p>
<p><center><a href="/images/2011/dear_arby_z09.jpg"><img src="/images/2011/dear_arby_z09.jpg" width=500></a></center></p>
<p>z09 didn&#8217;t include his home address so that I could send him a PLA shirt, so I was able to blow his $20 on cheap hookers without having to give anything back.  Soon after this I stalked him back, which seemed to freak him out and caused him to disappear from our community forever.  I thought about sending a shirt to his address, but he seemed so unhappy at being exposed that I decided against it since I didn&#8217;t want to get him in trouble at home.  If you ever see this, z09, tell me where to send a book or a shirt!</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/dear_arby_bonn_scott.jpg"></center></p>
<p>Earlier this year I received this strange letter.  It was from overseas with no return address.  Inside was a single dollar bill so crisp that I suspected it was counterfeit.  In place of George Washington&#8217;s face was a sticker of a man identified as Bonn Scott.  With the dollar was an extra Bonn Scott sticker, which I stuck on another dollar bill of mine before spending them both.</p>
<p>I had to Google who Bonn Scott was online and I ended up finding several other pictures of dollar bills with this same defacement.  I also found <a href="http://celebrity-cash.com/catalog/product_info.php?manufacturers_id=28&#038;products_id=173&#038;osCsid=bfdef99200b11b">this website</a> that sells the Bonn Scott stickers.  Maybe it was all just a ploy to get me to advertise that site.  But from overseas?  God, you PLA people are weird.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/dear_arby_from_darkstranger.jpg"></center></p>
<p>Finally there&#8217;s the extremely nice gift that Darkstranger sent me this week &#8211; a book of Sir John Hargrave&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JZWRMQ/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;tag=phonelosersof-20&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;camp=217145&#038;creative=399373&#038;creativeASIN=B004JZWRMQ">Prank The Monkey</a>, the book from the awesome website <a href="http://www.zug.com">zug.com</a>.  I&#8217;ve been reading it all week and it&#8217;s awesome.  Thanks, Darkstranger!</p>
<p>I swear I&#8217;m not fishing for gifts, but it&#8217;d be awesome if you decided to send weird postcards or drawings or other non-valuable things to my P.O. box so that I can post them in a future update.  To write to me, just <strike>track down my home address</strike> write to PLA (or Brad Carter) at P.O. Box 465, Albany, OR, 97321.  </p>

<p>The picture above is by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/prehack">Sebastian</a>, who posted it on the <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=6823.0">PLA Forums</a> with this message: &#8220;I colored this picture of a pepper at the local Chili&#8217;s restaurant. I believe that, through this artwork and those of others, Phone Losers has a chance to live forever, maybe above the fountain drink machine or in a corner somewhere, and perhaps slightly overlapped by a better picture. We must all do our part.&#8221; </p>

Click on the image to see it full sized so you can read it.</center></p>
<p>The comic above was done by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/patrickqmurphy">Patrick Q</a>. and posted on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=133768693397041&#038;set=t.514202099&#038;type=1&#038;theater">his Facebook photo album</a>.  I could be wrong, but I think it might be in response to a story we did on this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow/">Phone Show</a> about possibly the world&#8217;s first prank callers.</p>
<p>The story, <a href="http://io9.com/5855904/found-the-earliest-known-evidence-of-a-prank-phone-call">from io9.com</a>, says that a newspaper in 1884 printed the following paragraph:  &#8220;A GRAVE JOKE ON UNDERTAKERS — Some malicious wag at Providence R.I. has been playing a grave practical joke on the undertakers there, by summoning them over the telephone to bring freezers, candlesticks and coffin for persons alleged to be dead. In each case the denoument was highly farcical, and the reputed corpses are now hunting in a lively manner for that telephonist.&#8221;  This was 8 years after the invention of the telephone.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/2011_far_side_go_away_pla.jpg"></center></p>
<p>This Far Side comic was re-worded by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cykovisuals">cyko</a>.  I&#8217;m not sure what it originally said, but I bet cyko&#8217;s version is much funnier.</p>
<p>Finally, below is a picture that I created earlier today and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150345211432100&#038;set=a.489544867099.264056.514202099&#038;type=1&#038;theater">posted on Facebook</a>.  Some people seem to think the quote is inaccurate, but they clearly know nothing about hacker culture or history.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/hackerquote.jpg"></center></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re the kind of person who likes humorous pictures that are nothing like the pictures above, then you&#8217;ll probably like <a href="http://www.jeremyshouseoffunny.com/">Jeremy&#8217;s House of Funny</a>.  This is a new project started up by Heywood, the guy who used to run major-losers.com and has brought all kinds of wonderful things to the PLA this past decade.  There&#8217;s nothing on the main page yet, but you should join us on the forums!  You should also join <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jeremyshouse">his Facebook page</a> which brings you humorous pictures throughout the day.</p>

<p>During last week&#8217;s Phone Show, I asked listeners to leave notes on cars in their neighborhoods, claiming that they&#8217;d accidentally dented the car and to call me.  Over the past week I&#8217;ve received about 10 calls from angry and/or confused car owners, asking what happened.  You can listen to a few of their reactions to our crazy stories in the video below.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/E0VRA9n6jb4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to help us out with this prank, write a note and leave it on a random car with the 425-TWO FOUR THREE-7565 phone number.  Don&#8217;t actually damage a car, though, as tempting as it may be.</p>
<p>What would you say to a person who called you, thinking you&#8217;d damaged their car?  Leave your ideas in the comments below!</p>

<p><b>Happy Halloween, everyone!</b>  And thanks for the cool PLA pumpkin, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/patrickqmurphy">Patrick</a>.</p>
<hr color=#f6b921 width=75%>
<p><img src="/images/book/pla_zine_collection.png" alt="PLA 'Zine Collection" align="left" />If you&#8217;ve been thinking, &#8220;Man, I just don&#8217;t have enough PLA books on my shelf!&#8221; this past year, then are you in for surprise!  A brand new PLA book has been released this week!  And by brand new, I mean it&#8217;s a collection of all our old e-zine issues from the 1990&#8242;s.</p>
<p>For the past couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been formatting all the old <a href="/zine/">&#8216;zine issues of PLA</a> into Kindle format, for no reason at all really.  I finished that up and you can <a href="/book/download/">download all 47 issues of PLA</a> for free right now.  Formats available are Kindle, PDF, DOC and HTML.  I plan to add versions for the Sony reader and the Nook very soon to that list.</p>
<p>As I finished up the ebook, though, I decided to go ahead and release an actual book of the &#8216;zine too, mostly just because I thought it&#8217;d be cool to have one for myself.  Here&#8217;s a video of the finished book.</p>
<p><center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/11R_Do6_1rI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not making this book available on Amazon, just so it will be a few dollars cheaper for you to buy it.  Instead you have to go to <a href="https://www.createspace.com/3711326">CreateSpace</a> and buy it directly from them for $13.93.  I know that sounds like a lot for a book of old, outdated information, but it&#8217;s 800 pages of old, outdated information so it&#8217;s totally worth it.  You may want to buy this as soon as you can because I can&#8217;t make any guarantees on how long this book will remain available.  It&#8217;s filled with things that could probably get it removed from the market.</p>
<p>This book is completely non-profit for me.  The high price is just 40 cents higher than the minimum CreateSpace will allow me to sell it for.  I spent $40.00 to make the book $10 cheaper to sell, so I&#8217;m kind of hoping that 100 people will buy it over the next year so that I&#8217;ll get my $40 back.  After that, the price will be lowered to about $13.50.  I&#8217;m only mentioning this so that you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m desperately trying to make a quick buck off of the writings of a bunch of wannabe hackers from the 90&#8242;s.</p>
<p>For the most part, this book is completely unedited.  All of the original phone numbers and other personal information of people we harassed back then is still included.  A few small items were rearranged or taken out to fit in the book better, but it&#8217;s pretty much all there.  The biggest items I removed were 3 giant articles from Dr. Hate&#8217;s Issue #099, which included a beastiality FAQ and a video game instruction manual.  Hopefully you can live without those things.  I didn&#8217;t correct any spelling or grammatical errors, except in a few titles, so it&#8217;s super authentic.</p>
<p>So <a href="https://www.createspace.com/3711326">go buy this</a>!  Or <a href="/book/download/">go download it for free</a>!</p>
<p>And while you&#8217;re <a href="/book/download/">downloading the ebook</a>, you&#8217;ll probably notice that I&#8217;ve made the first PLA book available for free too.  Enjoy it!  Give it to as many people as you can!  Distribute it on torrents!  Print it out and sell it to people!  And then, to thank me for your free ebook, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Phone-Losers-America-Brad-Carter/dp/1452876169/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1293747073&#038;sr=8-1">go to the PLA book page on Amazon and leave a review</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=6826.0">A recent forum post</a> motivated me to create a new torrent of everything PLA has ever done.  Thanks to the nonstop Phone Show episodes, the torrent is now up to 15 gigs.  You&#8217;ll also get every episode of the PLA Radio podcast, the Big Beef Bueno podcast, and thousands of prank calls, pictures and text.  Download it right away and seed it for as long as you possibly can!  And later this year when I try to sell a prank call album, be sure to laugh at me and remind me that I already gave it all away for free.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/stuff/pla_media_pack_2011.torrent">Click here to download the 2011 Media Pack</a></center></p>
<p>You might also be interested in the torrent I put up last year that contains every prank call album I have.  There&#8217;s a lot of good stuff in there.  <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/stuff/prankphonecalls.torrent">Download my prank call torrent.</a></p>
<p>And speaking of prank calls, I&#8217;ve <a href="/prankcalls/">created a new page on phonelosers.org of the PLA&#8217;s prank calls</a>.  On this page you&#8217;ll find all the categories of prank calls available on phonelosers.org, with samples and links to each section.  I tried to make the samples the best of each section, but you should let me know if you think something else belongs there instead of what I&#8217;ve put up.  I&#8217;m too old to be making important decisions like this!</p>

<p>Today a guy on YouTube named <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/idiotcomic">idiotcomic</a> told me about a band from the early 2000&#8242;s that found an old answering machine at a thrift store filled with messages from the previous owner.  This group of guys took the audio from the answering machines messages and turned them into an album full of songs based on the messages!  The machine was a Sanyo TAS1000, so they named their band after the machine &#8211; TAS1000.</p>
<p>The music, while just a little repetitive, is still pretty catchy and the fact that it&#8217;s made with some unwitting lady&#8217;s answering machine tape makes me love them.  The ex-owner of the machine apparently wasn&#8217;t as amused as I am, though &#8211; she sued the band for using her messages without her permission, according to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/topic.php?uid=188792217816645&#038;topic=348">this message</a> posted by the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TAS1000">TAS Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of their songs&#8230;</p>
<p><center><iframe width="420" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Yt2oUCU65j8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RAUqw3cBe3I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
<p>You can listen to the entire album, called A Message For Marta, on YouTube by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yt2oUCU65j8&#038;feature=results_video&#038;playnext=1&#038;list=PL0EBD6E0175CDDCFB">clicking here</a> or you can download their album in mp3 format <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/AMessageForMartha">from here</a> for free.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/tas1000-01.jpg"><br />
<font size=-1>A member of the band plays the keyboard and the answering machine</font></center></p>
<p>The band&#8217;s old website at TAS1000.com is gone, but you can still view it through <a href="http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060701000000*/http://tas1000.com">archive.org</a> where you&#8217;ll find photos and a history of the band.  And you can visit the band&#8217;s Facebook at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TAS1000">facebook.com/TAS1000</a>.  Here is some information about them that I found on archive.org.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It was at a Value Village in Kelowna that an answering machine, the Sanyo Telephone Answering System 1000, was purchased in August 2001. When the previous owners’ tape was discovered inside, the musical potential of the messages became immediately clear.  </p>
<p>A band was quickly formed to explore the possibilities, and, assuming the name of the machine, the TAS 1000 collective set about writing appropriate original music to augment each message. Every song features an oblivious ‘vocalist,’ and they all have a story to tell.</p>
<p>Apart from a collection of ballads sung by unsuspecting strangers, A Message For Marta is also an unauthorized musical biography of the machine’s previous owners, the intended recipients of the messages: evidently, a woman named Marta and her family. Marta’s own voice may be heard on the opening track of the album in the form of her outgoing greeting</p>
<p>TAS 1000 played its debut show on October 31, 2002, at Ms. T’s Cabaret in Vancouver, which was followed by a CD release party hosted by local English as a Second Language students.&#8221;</i></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;m going to do often, but today I was attempting to clean out my email&#8217;s In box and I&#8217;ve decided to share a few emails with the visitors of phonelosers.org, without the consent of the people who send them.  Fuck you, people who send them!  I might turn this into a semi-regular thing, where I just dump some of the better emails I get into a post.  I promise it won&#8217;t be more than a few times a year, though.  Luckily, &#8220;a few&#8221; can mean anything I want it to mean, so get ready to see 18 of these posts per day!</p>

Dear Arby,<br />
So I think it was a little less than 2 years ago I bought a sticker for $1.00 from you and you didn&#8217;t get around to sending it for about a month. So you included a CD, 2 extra stickers, and a button. Not to mention you paid $1.25 for shipping which I thought was hilarious.</p>
<p>Over the next year I spent a lot of time listening to the entire CD before I had to leave for basic training..<br />
oh yeah I forgot to mention I joined the US army. Not that you&#8217;re probably that interested but, I left last July for basic and AIT, just finished my AIT (Advanced Individual Training) a few months ago.</p>
<p>My army job is as a 25B (Information Technology Specialist).  I basically set up switches, routers and run CAT5 lines everywhere.</p>
<p>Anyway. I randomly came across that CD that you sent me today and I thought I would check out the site. I like the new page with the pay phone layout. Then saw your book and instantly decided to buy 1 and some more stickers.</p>
<p>If I still have it when I deploy I&#8217;ll bring it with me.</p>
<p>Thanks again.<br />

<p>Of course, I&#8217;m putting this letter first because, unlike everyone else in the world, WiFiPunk actually likes the layout of this page <i>and</i> he points out how awesome I am at including extra shit when people <a href="/store/">order things from me</a>.  Thanks for that, sir!  And have fun doing all your phone work in the Army!  Be sure to set some phone lines on fire as a homage to PLA.</p>

Dear Arby,<br />
For the past two years the conversations that I have with specific people have an unusual characteristic &#8211; periodic beeping (very low).  This happens as well to those people who call my cell from their landlines.  I follow politics and the agendas of various politicians/branches very closely.  I simply wonder if this is part of total information awareness.  I would think that the technology would have reached the point of no detection by the typical individual.  Thank you for your time. </p>

<p>I should probably point out that people don&#8217;t <b>really</b> address me as Dear Arby when they write me emails.  I&#8217;m simply stealing that idea from Lord Nod because he called me that once.  Another thing I should point out is that I get a <i>lot</i> of emails like this one.  At least 1 per week and sometimes more, all because of <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/article/recording_telephone_calls/">my page on recording phone calls</a> which also gives advice on finding a physical tap on their phone line.  The only thing people love to ask me more than if their phone is being tapped by the government is how they can tap the phones of their spouse or kids to find out who they&#8217;re having sex with.  The letters are nuts and you can read a bunch of them on <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=905.0">this thread at the PLA Forums</a>.  Here&#8217;s what I wrote back to her.</p>

Dear J,<br />
That beep you hear?  That&#8217;s your call waiting.  Hit the flash button and you&#8217;ll be connected to the other party.  Quit thinking that you&#8217;re such an important person that the government would bother to listen to your calls and that the government is so inept that they don&#8217;t know how to tap a phone without you hearing a beeping sound.  Your life is not a spy movie.  In fact, I bet you&#8217;re actually a pretty boring person. </p>
<p>Have fun following your politics,<br />
Arby

Dear Arby,<br />
I built a forum for my little website, so now I&#8217;m inviting people to join.  It&#8217;s mainly video game related. There aren&#8217;t very many members as of now. If you want to come register, that&#8217;d be great, if not then that&#8217;s ok too, but at least you got invited ^.^</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />

<p>Hey Scott.   I&#8217;m not really into video games so I wouldn&#8217;t get much use out of those forums.  Thanks for the invitation, though!  I&#8217;m posting this on phonelosers.org, though, so maybe people who are into video games will get some use out of it.  Because I&#8217;m doing this, I&#8217;ll probably get a dozen emails a day from people asking me to do the same thing.  Ugh, what have I done.  Thanks a lot, jerk.</p>

Dear Arby,<br />
Why don&#8217;t we get a Ventrillo server for the PLA? There ultra cheap and it runs on freeware! All we need to do is rent a server and there like $9 a month! Screw Mindcraft! Let&#8217;s have a Ventrillo Bridge!</p>

<p>I do like this idea, but I just don&#8217;t have the time to start messing with something like that.  The problem is that I would enjoy it too much and I would become obsessed with it, just like I did a few years ago when I set up an Asterisk box.  My other reason for pooing all over your idea is that while phone bridges are cool and they let you chat with people, <a href="http://www.tinychat.com/phonelosers">our Tinychat room</a> does the same thing, but also has streaming video and text chat and it&#8217;s <i>free</i>.  Plus we&#8217;ve already got TheN&#8217;s voice bridge at 253-397-1819.  He&#8217;s really into telephony and could put a lot more love into something like this than I could.  You should track down TheN at <a href="http://afterthetone.org/">afterthetone.org</a> and force him to do cool new things with the stuff he&#8217;s got set up.</p>
<hr color=#000000 width=75%>
<p>And that&#8217;s it for this edition of Dear Arby.  Do you want to send an email to be included in the next exciting edition?  Send your questions about how to spy on your wife&#8217;s phone calls to &#8230; ugh, no.  Fuck that.  Find my address yourself.  I&#8217;m not making it that easy.</p>

Nick Badfish says that the picture above is a &#8220;projection copy in pencil&#8221; which is about a foot in diameter on the wall next to his stove.  I&#8217;m going to assume that he drew this ON the wall and not on a piece of posterboard because he loves PLA so much that he&#8217;s more interested in spreading the love of the PLA logo than getting his rent deposit back someday.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=158234327584429&#038;set=at.153825914691937.37946.100001935892563.514202099&#038;type=1">Go here to see the original post</a>.</p>

<p>This drawing by <a href="http://www.afterthetone.org">TheN</a> won&#8217;t make a lot of sense to you unless you&#8217;re a dedicated listener of <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow">The Phone Show</a> and know about that one thing that happened with that one 7-Eleven clerk involving Twinkees, Gatorade and a mop bucket.</p>

<p>As always, Defcon was freakin&#8217; awesome, but this year it was an entirely different level of awesome because there were a bunch of PLA people there to hang out with, such as <a href="http://www.hyenateeth.com">Rob The Hyena</a>, Sudo, Staci (or whatever the I&#8217;m supposed to call her this week), <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/666hill0ck666">Laugh Track Matt</a>, <a href="http://www.thisisarecording.com">Jenn</a>, Afreak, Jammie, Blue Boy, murd0c, and of course, Scanner Mel!</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/2011_defcon19_sudo_staci_rob.jpg" alt="SUDO STACI ROB"></center></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/funshow/">Staci</a> wasn&#8217;t going to be able to make it, but at the last minute a bunch of people chipped in some cash and made sure she got to sit on a Greyhound bus for more than 24 hours straight!  It was the best hax ever, putting her through that kind of hell.  A ton of thanks goes to the people who donated, including Tombstone, Spacebison, <a href="http://www.rbcpraped.me">Trevor Burdick</a>, <a href="http://www.hyenateeth.com">Rob The Hyena</a>, Richard H., djskott, pfelon, Blaise, and most importantly, <a href="http://www.notla.com">ME</a>!  Also, tons of thanks to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thesamantha">io</a>, who suckered some guy into giving Staci a free Defcon badge to get in.  Some people donated with expectations of having Staci write URLs on a t-shirt that she would wear all weekend.  She went through at least a couple of shirts throughout the weekend and I&#8217;m going to attempt to list the URLs below.  If your URL has been forgotten, leave a note in the comments or email to get it added.  Thanks a ton for allowing me to meet the infamous Staci Stack!</p>

You also might want to keep an eye on our <a href="/hotel/">Hotel Pranks page</a> for a few new pranks to be added, since we spent about an hour a day listening to the hotel staff on a scanner and then called the rooms involved to mess with them.  Apparently Defcon attendees are just as full of legal threats as normal people are!</p>

<p>Cell phone service was a huge failure for my cell phone while I was inside the Rio, so I missed a lot of texts and tweets, making me miss out on meeting a few people.  I couldn&#8217;t even say hi to RijilV because our texts were delayed by about 15 minutes and we ended up giving up on each other.  If I missed you, that sucks.  NEXT time we&#8217;ll all have to work out a better system for daily PLA cactus worshiping at a specified time/place since the Rio seems to be one giant Faraday cage.  </p>

<p>Thanks, everyone, for showing up and saying hi to me.  And huge apologies to everyone that I neglected because I was so busy all weekend.  If you weren&#8217;t able to make it this year, start planning for next year!  And just to make you feel like you were there, here are a bunch of photo albums from a few of us PLA folks.</p>

<font size=1><i>Thanks for the pic, cyko!</i></font></center></p>
<p>Defcon is a mere <b>one week away!</b>  Are you going?  You should be.  Quit your jobs, drop out of school and dump your girlfriends so that nothing will stand in your way of making it to Defcon to hang out with some of us other Phone Losers.  Move to Nevada permanently if that&#8217;s what it takes.  If all goes well, you will be able to meet 3/4ths of the entire <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com">Cacti Radio</a> DJ staff, including <a href="http://www.facebook.com/robrayburn">Rob The Hyena</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bradthecarter">RBCP</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000221957808">Laugh Track Matt</a>!  Rob says he&#8217;ll even be doing a special edition of <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/prankshow">The Prank Show</a> on Saturday night.  Other people who claim they&#8217;re going are <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a>, Sudo, afreak, DBK, RogueClown, <a href="http://www.thisisarecording.com">Jenn</a>, blu3b0y, Jammie, ApprenticePhreak, i-ball, lmnk, Evie, gnnr, and a bunch of other people who have messaged me, but I can&#8217;t remember.  This is going to be a fairly huge meetup, so be sure to track us all down and say hello.</p>
<p>Defcon 19 will be at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, from August 4th to August 7th. Admission is an outrageous $150 per person, so bring lots of badge counterfeiting supplies with you. A few of us aren’t even buying admission into Defcon since there will still be plenty to do on the outskirts of Defcon. And if you buy some of us enough beer, we might even loan our Defcon badge to you so you can get in for a bit. So don’t let the entrance fee deter you! Come to Defcon! Visit <a href="http://www.defcon.org">defcon.org</a> for official Defcon information and visit <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=6235.0">PLA’s Defcon planning thread</a> on the PLA forums to make plans with us.</p>
<p>During <a href="http://thephoneshow.blogspot.com/2011/07/06-26-2011-defcon-is-next-week.html">this week&#8217;s Phone Show</a>, r0xy called in and asked for some donations to help her make it to Defcon this year.  Surprisingly, a lot of people took her seriously and sent in some very generous donations to help her make it and it looks like she&#8217;ll actually make it.  A ton of thanks goes out to everyone who is helping to make this happen, including Tombstone, Spacebison, Trevor Burdick, pfelon, Richard H., Rob The Hyena, podjackel and, of course, ME!  She hasn&#8217;t quite met her goal to make it from Texas to Vegas, though.  If you&#8217;d like to help out, send anything you can to rbcp@phonelosers.org and I&#8217;ll forward it to r0xy.  If r0xy happens to not make it to Vegas, all money will be refunded.  But at this point, it&#8217;s looking likely that she&#8217;ll make it, so thanks a ton everyone!</p>
<p><b>FOLLOW US ON TWITTER!</b>  Following us on Twitter will help ensure that you can effectively stalk the PLA while you&#8217;re at Defcon.  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/rbcp">RBCP&#8217;s twitter</a> will likely be updated often, just as it has been at previous Defcons in recent years.  You can keep an eye on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/phonelosers">PLA&#8217;s twitter</a>, but that probably won&#8217;t be updated at all.  You might also try following <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jayeennenn">Jenn</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jammie718">Jammie</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rogueclown">RogueClown</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/afreak">afreak</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/LeoZ01">i-ball</a>.  I guess we could all hashtag <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23phonelosers">#phonelosers</a> too, but I&#8217;ll probably be too drunk to remember to do that.  I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve forgotten people, so if you&#8217;re the type likely to be getting thrown out with us, then post your Twitter link in the comments below!</p>
<p>Oh, and one last thing&#8230;bring your PLA book with you!  <a href="http://weaknetlabs.com">Trevelyn</a> had the amazing idea of turning his copy of the PLA book into sort of a yearbook, having all of his PLA colleagues sign it.  This is pretty much the best idea ever, and we should all steal it.  I&#8217;ve already had my personal copy signed by a couple of people and I&#8217;m looking forward to having it signed by a lot more.</p>
<p>Holy shit, only one week!  See you all there!<br />

<p>All the recent submitted PLA art from people like <a href="http://phoenixprime.deviantart.com/">HBB</a> and <a href="http://alex-cooper.deviantart.com/">Alex Cooper</a> has made me decide that I really need to set up a page on phonelosers.org just for submitted art.  So I did.  Visit <a href="/art">www.phonelosers.org/art/</a> to see the latest PLA drawings that have been emailed to me.  </p>
<p>The page is looking a little bare right now, but I plan to keep adding to it from drawings that have been sent to me over the years.  If you&#8217;d like your own PLA drawings to be added to that page, then <a href="mailto:rbcp@phonelosers.org">email them to me</a>.  Besides being featured on that page, your art might get used on other sections of this website.</p>

<p><blink><font color=red><b>UPDATE #1:</b></font></blink> Have you joined <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phone-Losers-of-America/206543704000">PLA&#8217;s Facebook</a> yet?  Because you&#8217;re a stupid dumb newb if you haven&#8217;t.  Sure we post updates on this website and on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/phonelosers">our Twitter</a>, but most of the hardcore PLA action happens on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phone-Losers-of-America/206543704000">PLA Facebook</a>.  I just made the title of this update RED and BLINKING so this is obviously an important issue.  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phone-Losers-of-America/206543704000">GO JOIN THE PLA FACEBOOK!</a></p>
<hr width=75% color=#000000>
<p><marquee BEHAVIOR=ALTERNATE WIDTH="25%"><font color=red><b>UPDATE #2:</b></font></marquee> Are you going to <a href="http://www.defcon.org">Defcon</a> with us?  In just one month, the biggest PLA meetup in the history of the world (since our Jonbenet murder meetup) will be happening in Las Vegas and will include amazing people like <a href="http://www.notla.com">RBCP</a>, RogueClown, el_jefe, Jammie, Chris Ellerbeck&#8217;s mom, io, Laugh Track Matt, <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a> and a lot of other people who are only of moderate importance so I won&#8217;t mention them because they&#8217;re newbs and don&#8217;t really matter.  </p>
<p>Defcon 19 will be at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, from August 4th to August 7th. Admission is an outrageous $150 per person, so bring lots of badge counterfeiting supplies with you.  A few of us aren&#8217;t even buying admission into Defcon since there will still be plenty to do on the outskirts of Defcon.  And if you buy some of us enough beer, we might even loan our Defcon badge to you so you can get in for a bit.  So don&#8217;t let the entrance fee deter you!  Come to Defcon!  Visit <a href="http://www.defcon.org">defcon.org</a> for official Defcon information and visit PLA’s Defcon planning thread on the PLA forums to make plans with us.</p>
<hr width=75% color=#000000>
<p><marquee BEHAVIOR=ALTERNATE WIDTH="25%"><blink><font color=red><b>UPDATE #3:</b></font></blink></marquee>  Okay, shit&#8217;s getting real now because I&#8217;m using the scroll tag AND the blink tag, so you know this part is important.  Here it goes&#8230;PLA has their own Minecraft server now!  That&#8217;s right, back in the day we were doing crazy illegal things with telephones and having epic adventures on the streets of Corpus Christi, but in 2011 we&#8217;re reduced to nothing but a bunch of nerds who play <a href="http://www.minecraft.net">Minecraft</a> all day.  Awesome, right??  You can learn more about our Minecraft world by visiting <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=6429.0">this thread in the PLA forums</a> or just point your Minecraft client to 96.44.162.50:26026</p>
<hr width=75% color=#000000>
<p><blink><font color=red><b>UPDATE #4:</b></font></blink> Did you notice that <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow">The Phone Show</a> didn&#8217;t happen last week?  I mean, it sort of happened but it wasn&#8217;t done by ME so the dumb stuff that Aikison did in my absence is totally insignificant.  There won&#8217;t be a Phone Show this week either.  And maybe even none the following week.  I might be able to squeeze one in before I leave for Defcon, but don&#8217;t expect a lot of Phone Show antics until after Defcon.  </p>
<p>The good news is that there are at least 2 other shows that you can listen to on Cacti Radio during the week during my absence.  Rob The Hyena does <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/prankshow">The Prank Show</a> every Saturday night at 9pm Pacific and Staci Stack is still doing her <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/funshow">Fun Show</a> on  Wednesday nights at 8pm Pacific.  There are other shows that happen too, like Aikison and Badfish&#8217;s live show on Fridays at 9pm Pacific and Carlito&#8217;s Madhouse on Thursdays at 7pm Pacific which he hasn&#8217;t done in MONTHS NOW so I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m even posting it.</p>
<hr width=75% color=#000000>
<p><blink><font color=red><b>UPDATE #5 WHICH ISN&#8217;T REALLY AN UPDATE BUT A QUESTION:</b></font></blink>  What do you think of the new design on phonelosers.org?  Doesn&#8217;t the pea green background just make you want to throw up?  And that pay phone menu over on the side?  Have you ever even seen it?  I never have because it takes 3 years to load, and I designed it!  I bet it&#8217;s cool though.  If you dial the standard Bell secret code into the keypad, a bunch of money is transferred to your PayPal.  Try it!  Let me know what you think about the design in the comments.  Critique your hearts out and let me know how it could improve.  And, oh yeah, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phone-Losers-of-America/206543704000">GO JOIN THE PLA FACEBOOK!</a></p>
<p>Love,<br />

<p>I received this amazing picture in my email today, along with a message reading, &#8220;Greetings RBCP.  Been lurking your site for a few years.  Wanted to say thanks for the entertainment and information; so I drew you a picture of naked, siamese twin, zombie Mildred Mondays trying to kill each other.  Keep up the good work.&#8221;  The artist&#8217;s name is Alex Cooper and you can <a href="http://alex-cooper.deviantart.com/">visit his DevArt page here</a> to see the full-sized image and his other awesome illustrations.  Thanks, Alex!  This has made my day and I&#8217;m sure other fans of Mildred will love it too.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know who Mildred Monday is, then you don&#8217;t spend nearly enough time on this website.  <a href="/rip/mildred/">Here is our memorial to her</a>, which includes <i>clothed</i> pictures of Mildred and songs that praise her awesomeness.</p>
<p>And speaking of PLA art&#8230;I recently added about 100 images to the <a href="/photos/">PLA Photo Album</a>.  Because I&#8217;m so lazy, I got rid of that dumb Coppermine photo album software we&#8217;ve been using for years and just sorted everything into directories.  There&#8217;s a lot of good stuff in there, a lot of it that I&#8217;ve never put on the net before.  <a href="/photos/">Go enjoy it</a>!</p>
<p>And holy shit, Alex, thanks again!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><center><img src="/images/2011/pla_book_holy_bible.jpg" alt="PLA Book and a Holy Bible - which is better?"></center></p>
<p>This morning I received the following email from a guy who ordered a <a href="/book/">PLA book</a> and t-shirt from me earlier in the week:</p>
<p><center><br />
<table width=75% bgcolor=000000>
<tr>
<td bgcolor=ffffff><font face=terminal size=3 color=000000><br />
Dear Brad,<br />
I received my book (with an awesome note!) a t shirt and some other free stuff you piled on my purchase.  Thank You.</p>
<p>I wanted to contribute to your web hosting since you give me hours of free entertainment week after week. I have sent $10 to your paypal for that purpose. Please accept it with my best wishes.</p>
<p>Saurabh<br />
</font></td>

</table>
<p></center></p>
<p>So besides making me feel all warm and fuzzy for the kind donation, this email has motivated me to finally enact a suggestion by John Sever (yes, the John Sever from the PLA book) &#8211; we need to donate PLA books to needy Christian schools!  Imagine that you&#8217;re a child in a Christian school and <b>there are no PLA books for the students!</b>  This is a reality for many Christian schools across the U.S.A.  With the help of people like Saurabh and John and <b>you</b> we can provide PLA books to many students that can&#8217;t afford them.</p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/victory_christian_school.jpg" alt="A Christian school that has NO PLA BOOKS"></center></p>
<p>Right now, the absolute cheapest I can send out hard copies of my book is $9.00.  I&#8217;m going to use Saurabh&#8217;s $10 donation toward the first copy I send out to a Christian school, and then I&#8217;ll have $1.00 left over towards the next donation to go out.  $9.00 pays for the book, the shipping box, and the post office&#8217;s shipping costs.  I will track all money donated on <a href="/book/donations/">this page</a> and I will include the names of people who&#8217;ve donated and which schools and other organizations I&#8217;ve donated to.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to donate right now, type in the amount of your donation (in U.S. dollars) below and click the PayPal button.  Or you can send your donation directly to me at rbcp@phonelosers.org.</p>
<p><center><br />

</form>
<p></center></p>
<p>I&#8217;m confident that in time, we will be able to equip <b>all</b> needy Christian schools with PLA books.  I&#8217;ve created <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=6420.0">a thread on the PLA Forums</a> where we can discuss ideas on specific Christian schools to donate to.  Thanks so much, Saurabh, and a huge thanks goes out to all future supporters of this cause!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in early 2009, <a href="http://www.party934.com">Party 934</a> gave me a slot on their radio station, which became <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow">The Phone Show</a>.  Almost immediately, a group of guys known as &#8220;pbx411&#8243; started calling into the show only to scream their URL at us and hang up.  It turned out that they completely hated me and linear, for reasons unknown, and made it their life&#8217;s mission to ruin The Phone Show.  They set up a bunch of fake Craigslist ads with the show&#8217;s phone number, which gave us fun content for the show and has become a tradition for us since then, and they constantly called in to tell us their URL.  They claimed complete victory in their war against the PLA when they found RogueClown&#8217;s phone number and sent a pizza to her house.  Just slightly over a month later, their campaign of terror was over, and linear and I were able to sleep peacefully again.</p>
<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t complain too much about a group of guys who call up a show and yell a single phrase at the host.  Our phone mobs against AM radio stations were mostly people calling in and working the word &#8220;cactus&#8221; into some form of weird joke that only PLA people would understand.  If anything, I <i>deserve</i> to be harassed on my own show, but they should at least have put a little more effort into it than simply yelling their URL and hanging up.  People wouldn&#8217;t still be listening to our old <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wu0KiZrzX0">What&#8217;s Your Bid prank</a> every day if all we did was call them up and yell, &#8220;PHONELOSERS DOT ORG!#!@##!@&#8221; at them.</p>
<p>So pbx411 disappeared for a couple of years as their domain name expired and disappeared as well.  But then, just a month ago, they came back!  This time they had a new domain name, called <a href="http://www.phonewinners.com">phonewinners.com</a> (get it?  because they&#8217;re not losers like us!), and a renewed irrational hatred for all things PLA.  The campaign of phone calls started up once again, only this time they were yelling &#8220;PHONEWINNERS DOT COM!!!&#8221; at us instead of &#8220;PBX411 DOT INFO!!!&#8221;.  They did the same to <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/funshow/">OhEmGee&#8217;s Fun Show</a> and they began spamming the Fruit Wall on phonelosers.org with their URL nonstop.  They seemed completely desperate to make their URL known, something that most people accomplish by simply asking me to post their link on the page for them.</p>
<p>So why do the Phone Winners hate me so much?  This is best part &#8211; apparently it&#8217;s because I deleted a post of Harry&#8217;s (he&#8217;s the head Phone Winner) on the PLA forums years ago.  That&#8217;s it.  I deleted a post.  I haven&#8217;t been told which post I deleted and I don&#8217;t even know if it was me that deleted it or one of the other mods there.  The only thing I&#8217;m certain of is that a deleted post from more than 2 years ago isn&#8217;t worth this much time and energy.  If you&#8217;re still seething with hatred after 2 years just because some post was deleted, then you have some issues.  But if you&#8217;re dedicating a large portion of your day to harassing the guy who runs these forums, then&#8230;I dunno.  That&#8217;s just weird.  Pretty much every time we&#8217;ve called into their voice bridge, they 2 guys on it are ranting about what a horrible person I am.  For deleting a post.</p>
<p>Stuff like this happens to me all the time, of course.  Harry and the Phone Winners are just the latest in the harassment that&#8217;s taken place against me during the past 15 years of doing PLA.  There&#8217;s always some guy that makes it his life&#8217;s mission to bring me down forever, usually for no reason at all and usually someone who thinks he&#8217;s completely anonymous and that I can never do anything about it.  This thing with Harry mostly reminds me of the StLSD2000 incident from about 10 years ago, where a guy named StLSD2000 decided that I was the most evil person in the world because I banned the use of numbers on the PLA Forums in an attempt to stomp out the problem with people posting credit card and calling card numbers there.  StLSD2000 began calling me at home and charging items to my phone bill, certain that he would bankrupt me and that my life would be over.  When I promised him that I would post the calling cards he sent me on phonelosers.org, he was really surprised to find out that not only did I figure out who he was, but that I  <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/images/index_archive_stlsd2000_big.jpg">posted all of his personal information on phonelosers.org</a> along with the calling cards.  I don&#8217;t think I ever heard from him after that.</p>
<p>The best course of action for people like this has always been to just completely ignore them.  They quickly get bored and go away, usually forever, but some of them keep at it until I figure out who they are.  Like z09, a person that a lot of you probably remember from the PLA Forums, who began stealing my account info from local businesses like Blockbuster and sending me pizzas and mailing spoiled food to my PO box.  He disappeared forever after I tracked him down and changed his forum avatar into <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?action=profile;u=1192">his boy scout photo</a>.  Or Compudroid, who hacked my site and was tricking everyone into dialing his ANI trap until I gave all of those people his home phone number, or Brice Carlson who dared the PLA to harass him and then began calling the police on me when I complied, or <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/jason/">Jason H</a> after he tried to get my sites taken down.  And, of course, there&#8217;s that little incident where <a href="/richardcardo/">Richard Cardo</a> tried to frame me for a high-profile murder case.  </p>
<p>Lately the Phone Winners have graduated from harassing me online to posting the personal information of PLA people on their site, threatening to assault me at Defcon this summer, calling my hosting company to social engineer MySQL info from them, and attempting to run up the bandwidth limit on my Cacti Radio host so that I&#8217;m charged an extra $10 per month, an expense that I just don&#8217;t see how I&#8217;m going to be able to ever afford.  Don&#8217;t worry, they haven&#8217;t even come close to reaching my limit yet, but they are still trying their best and I&#8217;m extremely worried about this.  The funny thing is, Harry doesn&#8217;t seem to know much about proxies, because while the logs on my website showed that he was using a free proxy service called <a href="sslbrowser.com">sslbrowser.com</a> to access my web site, they still displayed his real Comcast IP address in New Jersey.  </p>
<p><center><img src="/images/2011/harry_ip.jpg"></center></p>
<p>So yesterday I called Comcast and asked, &#8220;Hey, Comcast, who does this IP address belong to?&#8221; and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;LOL, it belongs to some girl named Deborah Garretson in Jersey City.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Oh?  Well what&#8217;s Deborah&#8217;s phone number?&#8221; and Comcast says, &#8220;It looks like the same Google Voice number that Harry used when he registered voipwin.com.&#8221;  This was exactly the moment that I began spending a large chunk of my work day researching Harry&#8217;s home.  I was able to find out that Harry&#8217;s real name is Joseph W Princiotta Jr and that although Harry loves <a href="http://phonewinners.com/2011/05/not-phone-losing/">bragging about making $3,000 <b>IN CASH</b> for making a single service call</a>, he still can&#8217;t seem to scrounge up enough money to move out of his mother&#8217;s house.  Yep, Harry is 44-years-old and still lives with his mom, Loretta.  Hasn&#8217;t moved out yet.  That&#8217;s gotta be hell on his dating life.</p>
<p>And it turns out that Harry is a huge internet celebrity too, <a href="http://www.fark.com/comments/5471159/When-playing-a-hilarious-prank-on-your-friend-make-sure-that-firecracker-youre-using-isnt-actually-a-Civil-War-re-enactors-gunpowder-tube">featured on FARK.com</a> for nearly <a href="http://civilwarcavalry.com/?p=2140">blowing his hand off</a> and sending some other guy <a href="http://www.dummphuck.com/?p=55">to the hospital</a>.  So Harry is 44, still lives with his mom, enjoys civil war reenactment shows, and is dumb enough to set fire to tubes of gun powder in his hand.  And, oh yeah, he doesn&#8217;t know how to use a proxy.  </p>
<p>So now I just feel kind of bad for Joe and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m giving him the attention that he&#8217;s been so desperate for all these years.  Visit his website at <a href="http://www.phonewinners.com">phonewinners.com</a>, where he&#8217;s put a ton of effort into bashing the PLA because he hates us, yet he&#8217;s been stealing all of our pranks and <a href="http://phonewinners.com/pw-stuff/prank-calls/">reposting them on his site</a>.  Don&#8217;t write anything hateful in the comments section, though, because even though Harry will flip out and harass you for 2 years when you delete a forum post of his, he will still delete your comments if they hurt his feelings.  </p>
<p>Call up Harry&#8217;s voice bridge at 212-389-1318 and talk to him and his life partner, Joseph Moskalshi in Easton, Pennsylvania, who pays for the web site and helps Harry call into the show and scream their URL at us every Tuesday and Wednesday night.  Once you tire of listening to The Joes complain about me all day, you should hang up and join the 21st century by hanging out with PLA on <a href="http://www.tinychat.com/phonelosers">Tinychat</a> or Skype.</p>
<p>Harry, please accept my apologies for deleting whatever forum post of yours that I deleted 2 years ago and please don&#8217;t throw a bag of piss on me at Defcon for that heinous crime.  If you want to join the forums and post it again, I&#8217;ll let you.  I sincerely hope that you appreciate that I&#8217;ve finally posted your URL on phonelosers.org and that you&#8217;ll stop trying to run up my bandwidth bill at PRQ, because if you manage to succeed, they&#8217;re going to charge me an extra $10 and that will totally ruin my life forever.  I make very little profit from selling PLA dog tags and I honestly don&#8217;t think I can sell enough dog tags to cover the expense that your hacking may end up costing me.  Please stop refreshing my page.  <i>Please!</i>  Oh, and test out free proxy services before you use them.</p>
<hr color=#000000 width=75%><b>NEXT MORNING UPDATE:</b> Last night we had fun talking about all of this on the air as Rob listened on their bridge.  As expected, Harry completely denies that he is Joseph Princiotta, playing it cool like I&#8217;m a huge retard and found the wrong person.  We called his bridge and tried to talk to him on the air, but he was strangely quiet during that.  (Maybe he had to go tend to a $3,000 service call.)  Pretend that you&#8217;re not Joseph W Princiotta Jr. all you want, Harry, but we know you are.  Your years of hiding your identity are officially over now.  Think of this as a favor from us.  You&#8217;ve always had to work so hard at being paranoid and keeping yourself hidden.  Now you&#8217;re free to just be yourself and not have to worry about ridiculous stuff like that.  Welcome to 2011, where we all have Facebooks and know each others real names!  I will definitely be your friend when you get yours set up, Joe.  :)</p>
<p><a name="updates"></p>
<hr color=#000000 width=75%><b>SLIGHTLY LATER IN THE MORNING UPDATE:</b> Oh, this is weird&#8230;the phonewinners.com whois info suddenly changed since last night&#8217;s Phone Show where we exposed Harry as Joseph Princiotta.  Used to <a href="/images/2011/pw_phonewinners1.jpg">the whois info clearly stated</a> that the domain was owned by Harry Mann with a fake PO box in Texas and a Google Voice number, which is the same Google Voice number on Harry&#8217;s cable TV account.  But now <a href="/images/2011/pw_phonewinners2.jpg">all of the whois info is suddenly blocked</a>.  (Click on those underlined words to see.)  He must have dropped a little of that $3,000 in cash of his to privatize his domain info.</p>
<p>Oh, and look at this.  Something similar also happened to voipwin.com, another domain name of Harry&#8217;s that currently forwards to phonewinners.com.  A month ago, the domain <a href="/images/2011/pw_voipwin1.jpg">belonged to Harry Mann in Texas City</a> and used the same Google Voice number as the other, but today that domain <a href="/images/2011/pw_voipwin2.jpg">suddenly belongs to the fake name of D. Sanchen in Hoboken, New Jersey</a> with a new phone number.  Isn&#8217;t that odd?  He must have changed that days ago and we didn&#8217;t notice.  Oh wait, no, he changed it <a href="/images/2011/pw_voipwin3.jpg"><b>immediately after we dropped his docs on The Phone Show</b></a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s strange that Harry would suddenly be scrambling to change all of his whois info so early this morning when he vehemently denies that he is  Joseph Princiotta from Jersey City, New Jersey.  If I&#8217;m wrong about his information as he claims I am, then why all the sudden changes in whois info?  It&#8217;s funny, last night during the aftershow I was commenting about how it&#8217;s too bad that I don&#8217;t have any actual proof that Harry is  Joseph Princiotta.  All people have to go on is trusting me in my confidence that I have the right person.  It&#8217;s pretty much my word against Harry&#8217;s.  I say he&#8217;s 44-years-old and still lives with his mother and likes to set himself on fire, while he says he&#8217;s a cool guy, living the high life and doing PBX consulting jobs that net him $3,000 in cash per night.  But this is almost as good as actual proof, having Harry freak out and change all of his whois info.  Thanks, Harry!</p>
<p>Oh, I should also mention that strangely enough, my cactiradio.com domain is suddenly <b>not</b> being refreshed nonstop today by Harry.  Funny that should stop all of a sudden.  Guess he&#8217;s got his hands full with changing whois info everywhere so he doesn&#8217;t have time to refresh my page all day.</p>
<hr color=#000000 width=75%><b>THE NEXT EVENING UPDATE:</b>  It&#8217;s been more than 24 hours now since last night&#8217;s Phone Show where I dropped Harry&#8217;s info and even though Harry swears that I&#8217;m wrong about his real identity, he hasn&#8217;t made a post on phonewinners.com to laugh at me for finding the wrong guy.  You&#8217;d think he would want to point out how dumb I am for finding the wrong person, since he&#8217;s clearly not this Joseph Princiotta character.  But nope, not a word on their site about how wrong I am. </p>
<p>Today we happened across <a href="http://www.myspace.com/rftech84">Joe Moskalshi&#8217;s Myspace page</a> and found some interesting photos on there.  There&#8217;s a <a href="/images/2011/pw_joe_m_civil_war_group_photo.jpg">civil war group photo</a> and there&#8217;s <a href="/images/2011/pw_joe_m_civil_war_bj.jpg">a civil war blow job</a> picture and a picture of Joe Moskalshi <a href="/images/2011/pw_joe_m_his_victorian_suit_for_christmas_caroling.jpg">wearing a Victorian suit</a> for Christmas caroling.  It sure is crazy that even though I got the wrong person and Harry isn&#8217;t Joseph Princiotta, his web site just happens to be hosted by a guy who really seems to be into Civil War reenactments.  What are the odds of that?</p>
<p><a name="6-6-11-update"></p>
<hr color=#000000 width=75%><b>THE NEXT WEEK (6/6/2011) UPDATE:</b> Man, Joseph Princiotta and Joseph Moskalshi are really on the run now!  They are deleting their accounts everywhere since PLA exposed their real identities, yet we&#8217;re still to believe that Harry isn&#8217;t really Joseph Princiotta.  Down in the comments here, you&#8217;ll see that Dely notified us that Harry deleted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/GibbedHGR">his YouTube account</a> last week, which is kind of weird.  Why would he delete the YouTube he used to spew racism at everyone while promoting his phone bridge? (<a href="/images/2011/harrys_youtube.png">Click here for a screen cap of his YouTube</a>.)  Is there something we don&#8217;t know?  Cause I sure can&#8217;t figure out a reason for him to delete his YouTube, other than him not wanting his real name associated with that YouTube.  But why?  If anyone knows the answers, post them in the comments here, or <a href="/contact/">contact me directly</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll never again get to see Harry&#8217;s gripping videos, like the one titled, &#8220;Pedophile Michael Jackson Left a Witness &#8211; Breaking Story!&#8221; where the description says, &#8220;Join the Michael Jackson Partyline! (212) 389-1318 It&#8217;s free, just a standard long-distance call.&#8221;  (Haha, &#8220;long-distance&#8221; like this is still the early 2000&#8242;s.)  A <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=212-389-1318">Google search for their phone number</a> finds all kinds of fun stuff like this.  (And so does a search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Gibbedhgr">GibbedHGR</a>.)   Harry used to <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110303135524AAswphQ">troll Yahoo Answers</a> to promote his bridge number too.  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110309090903AAwrVux">Check out this one</a> where he tried to get 15-year-old girls to call their bridge.  Wonder how that worked out for him.  Sad that his hard work went to waste, now that he&#8217;s locking the bridge.  MrX tells us that their bridge is often locked now.  Why would they lock their bridge?  Wouldn&#8217;t that defeat the whole purpose of a bridge?  They may as well just be calling each other on the phone to chat all night, like teenage girls do.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/rftech84">Joe Moskalshi&#8217;s Myspace page</a> has been deleted.  Surely he deleted that because nobody uses Myspace anymore and it was pointless to even have it.  It wasn&#8217;t because he didn&#8217;t like people seeing <a href="/images/2011/pw_joe_m_his_victorian_suit_for_christmas_caroling.jpg">the awesome pictures of him</a>.  At least we helped Moskalshi earn a Myspace badge before he killed his account.  His pictures received so much attention because of PLA that Myspace awarded him the &#8220;In The Spotlight&#8221; badge.  <a href="/images/2011/moskalshis_myspace.png">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Other than all the account deletions and the whois domain info changing, things have been really quiet on the Phone Winners front.  There haven&#8217;t been any new posts on <a href="http://phonewinners.com">their website</a>, when before they were making new posts every few days.  In fact, a few posts have even been deleted.  <a href="http://phonewinners.com/forum/">Their forums</a> haven&#8217;t had a single post on them in over a week now and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phone-Winners-of-America/160238767372313">their Facebook page</a> is dead.  Come on, Phone Winners, I finally give you all this attention that you&#8217;ve been begging me for for years now and then you just clam up and ignore me.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Back in early 2009, Party 934 gave me a slot on their radio station, which became The Phone Show.  Almost immediately, a group of guys known as &#8220;pbx411&#8243; started calling into the show only to scream their URL at us and hang up.  It turned out that they completely hated me and linear, for reasons unknown, and made it their life&#8217;s mission to ruin The Phone Show.  They set up a bunch of fake Craigslist ads with the show&#8217;s phone number, which gave us fun content for the show and has become a tradition for us since then, and they constantly called in to tell us their URL.  They claimed complete victory in their war against the PLA when they found RogueClown&#8217;s phone number and sent a pizza to her house.  Just slightly over a month later, their campaign of terror was over, and linear and I were able to sleep peacefully again.
Of course, I can&#8217;t complain too much about a group of guys who call up a show and yell a single phrase at the host.  Our phone mobs against AM radio stations were mostly people calling in and working the word &#8220;cactus&#8221; into some form of weird joke that only PLA people would understand.  If anything, I deserve to be harassed on my own show, but they should at least have put a little more effort into it than simply yelling their URL and hanging up.  People wouldn&#8217;t still be listening to our old What&#8217;s Your Bid prank every day if all we did was call them up and yell, &#8220;PHONELOSERS DOT ORG!#!@##!@&#8221; at them.
So pbx411 disappeared for a couple of years as their domain name expired and disappeared as well.  But then, just a month ago, they came back!  This time they had a new domain name, called phonewinners.com (get it?  because they&#8217;re not losers like us!), and a renewed irrational hatred for all things PLA.  The campaign of phone calls started up once again, only this time they were yelling &#8220;PHONEWINNERS DOT COM!!!&#8221; at us instead of &#8220;PBX411 DOT INFO!!!&#8221;.  They did the same to OhEmGee&#8217;s Fun Show and they began spamming the Fruit Wall on phonelosers.org with their URL nonstop.  They seemed completely desperate to make their URL known, something that most people accomplish by simply asking me to post their link on the page for them.
So why do the Phone Winners hate me so much?  This is best part &#8211; apparently it&#8217;s because I deleted a post of Harry&#8217;s (he&#8217;s the head Phone Winner) on the PLA forums years ago.  That&#8217;s it.  I deleted a post.  I haven&#8217;t been told which post I deleted and I don&#8217;t even know if it was me that deleted it or one of the other mods there.  The only thing I&#8217;m certain of is that a deleted post from more than 2 years ago isn&#8217;t worth this much time and energy.  If you&#8217;re still seething with hatred after 2 years just because some post was deleted, then you have some issues.  But if you&#8217;re dedicating a large portion of your day to harassing the guy who runs these forums, then&#8230;I dunno.  That&#8217;s just weird.  Pretty much every time we&#8217;ve called into their voice bridge, they 2 guys on it are ranting about what a horrible person I am.  For deleting a post.
Stuff like this happens to me all the time, of course.  Harry and the Phone Winners are just the latest in the harassment that&#8217;s taken place against me during the past 15 years of doing PLA.  There&#8217;s always some guy that makes it his life&#8217;s mission to bring me down forever, usually for no reason at all and usually someone who thinks he&#8217;s completely anonymous and that I can never do anything about it.  This thing with Harry mostly reminds me of the StLSD2000 incident from about 10 years ago, where a guy named StLSD2000 decided that I was the most evil person in the world because I banned the use of numbers on the PLA Forums in an attempt to stomp out the problem with people posting credit card and calling card numbers there.  StLSD2000 began call[...]</itunes:summary>

<p>Today I was in 7-11, and in a very very bad mood.  The cranky old counter-lady was eyeing me suspiciously, in a &#8220;that young man is wearing a black trenchcoat, he must be stealing something&#8221; way. This was the icing on my bad day of a cake.</p>
<p>So I retaliate by bringing the orange juice I&#8217;d come for to the counter, and calmly asking her to add to my purchases a copy of each and every porno magazine from behind the counter, one at a time.  &#8220;Oh, and that one, &#8216;Biker Sluts.&#8217;  Yes, thanks.  And say, what&#8217;s that one there?  &#8216;Black Hot Rods?&#8217; Yes, one of those.  And the next one over, &#8216;Pussy Parade.&#8217;  Yes, put it here, with the others.  And the one over there, I can&#8217;t read the title but it has that blond guy with his face in the other guy&#8217;s- yes, that one..&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>Soon I had a towering stack of about 20 porno mags next to my orange juice. &#8220;Will there be anything else?&#8221;  she barks at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, I hope you don&#8217;t judge me or anything based on this stuff I&#8217;m buying,&#8221; I offered.  &#8220;I just like them for the dirty pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, is that it or WHAT?&#8221; She really wanted to get rid of me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually&#8230;  I&#8217;ll tell you the truth, okay??  I only read the articles, but I&#8217;m too embarrassed to say!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then I ran out crying, leaving everything on the counter.  I walked around the block and collapsed on a bench, laughing myself silly for about 5 minutes straight.</p>
<p>I felt much better afterwards.</p>

<p>One of my favorite online comics, <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/archives/2011/May/">Toothpaste For Dinner</a>, recently gave us a crazy idea for a prank phone call &#8211; calling up our landlords and demanding that they reimburse us for all the sand we had dumped into our apartments.  For the most part, land lords were just confused, but a few of them got really frustrated and angry when they heard about our amazing sand renovations.</p>

<p>Clearly our prank calls are making apartment managers and landlords really appreciate the mundane problems they have to deal with every day.  Once the initial shock wears off and they finally check their tenants apartments and find no sand damage, they realize how good they&#8217;ve had it.

One of my favorite online comics, Toothpaste For Dinner, recently gave us a crazy idea for a prank phone call &#8211; calling up our landlords and demanding that they reimburse us for all the sand we had dumped into our apartments.  For the most part, land lords were just confused, but a few of them got really frustrated and angry when they heard about our amazing sand renovations.




Language Barrier: Gregulate has a hard time communicating his need to be reimbursed for his sand installation.




Toilet Problems: This lady is horrified to find out that RBCP has been flushing sand down his toilet. Just to give OhEmGee her credit &#8211; she came up with the idea of flushing sand down the toilet and leaving the water running to &#8220;get revenge&#8221; on the landlord.  She&#8217;s obviously a nightmare of a tenant in her apartment complex.




io Isn&#8217;t Believed: io&#8217;s landlord has a hard time believing her about the sand and finally decides that he just can&#8217;t do this anymore.




I Need Help: OhEmGee has some serious issues with all the sand she dumped in her apartment leaking into the unit below hers and the lady she speaks to is very worried about her mental health.




Old Folks Home: Rob The Hyena tries explaining to an old folks home that he filled his grandma&#8217;s room with sand.




Clearly our prank calls are making apartment managers and landlords really appreciate the mundane problems they have to deal with every day.  Once the initial shock wears off and they finally check their tenants apartments and find no sand damage, they realize how good they&#8217;ve had it.  Sure they have to deal with noise problems and tenants who can never pay their rent by the first, but at least nobody is filling up their apartments with sand!
If those calls above aren&#8217;t enough for you, then listen to a lady tell RBCP to get out of her life, another one get mad enough to do a &#8220;24 hour walkthrough,&#8221; one who laughs at RBCP&#8217;s problems and then he threatens revenge on another.  Also listen to OhEmGee run into some confusion with commercial property, then get upset because a lady won&#8217;t believe her story, then she  accidentally admits that she has a cat and demands use of the landlord&#8217;s shovel and a lady refuses to knock on OhEmGee&#8217;s window since her door is blocked with sand.

<p>If you&#8217;re a regular listener of <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow">The Phone Show</a>, then you&#8217;ve probably heard Rob The Hyena calling being a regular caller/host these past few months.  Rob is the guy who made <a href="http://cactiradio.appcitement.com/">Cacti Radio&#8217;s iPhone app</a>, using his <a href="http://www.appcitement.com/">AppCitement website</a>.  He&#8217;s also done a bit of PLA/Cacti art on his <a href="http://RobRayburn.DeviantART.com">DeviantART page</a> and sells weird tshirts on <a href="http://HyenaTeeth.com">HyenaTeeth.com</a>.</p>
<p>But why I&#8217;m really writing this post about Rob is because he&#8217;s been editing a ton of audio lately, mostly related to prank calls done outside of the regular Phone Show and Fun Show hours.  He&#8217;s got directories full of calls to <a href="http://piratesofthesoftware.com/audio/pranks/sixscreens/">a phone mob we did yesterday</a> and <a href="http://piratesofthesoftware.com/audio/pranks/subway/">a Subway we&#8217;ve been bothering</a> and, of course, the infamous <a href="http://piratesofthesoftware.com/audio/pranks/weathergirl/">Weather Girl pranks</a>.  There&#8217;s a lot more than that too, so go visit his page and browse the directories full of fun audio.</p>
<p><center><a href="http://piratesofthesoftware.com/audio/pranks/">piratesofthesoftware.com/audio/pranks/</a></center></p>
<p>While you&#8217;re listening, be sure to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/robrayburn">add Rob as a friend on Facebook</a> so you can get to know him before you meet him at Defcon this summer.  You&#8217;re going to Defcon, right?  RIGHT???  Cause all of us sure are.  </p>

<p>Er, I mean, goodbye for a day or two maybe.  I&#8217;m going to move phonelosers.org to my other server and that&#8217;s probably going to make it disappear for a day.  I&#8217;m updating my backups of it all right now, so it will probably be gone Thursday and/or Friday.  If all goes well, everything should be back to normal before the weekend is over.  Wish me luck!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t cry too much, though, because all of the other sites will still work.  You&#8217;ll still be able to visit <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com">Cacti Radio</a> and the <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com">PLA Forums</a>.  And <a href="http://www.signhacker.com">Sign Hacker</a> and <a href="http://www.oldpeoplearefunny.com">Old People Are Funny</a>, not that I ever update those sites anymore.   And, most importantly, <a href="http://www.notla.com">my homepage</a>.  Spend 100% of your time on those sites while we&#8217;re gone and it&#8217;ll be like we never left.</p>
<p>Love,<br />
Bradley</p>
<p><b>May 5th Edit:</b> The move has happened.  Some stuff will be broken for a few days, but should hopefully all be working again before the weekend is over.  Keep us in your prayers as we work as quickly as possible to restore all the advertisements that are currently missing.  Those are the most important part of the site!</p>

<p>For the past few months, OhEmGee, aka a long-time PLA girl whose name we are never again allowed to utter, has been doing a live prank call show on <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com">Cacti Radio</a>.  The show airs each Wednesday night at 9pm PST.  Listeners meet in <a href="http://www.tinychat.com/phonelosers">our tinychat room</a> and on efnet&#8217;s #phonelosers.  OhEmGee guarantees that each show will have at least 25% more fun than the last.  You can listen to old episodes by visiting <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/funshow/">cactiradio.com/funshow/</a> or you can subscribe to <a href="http://omgthefunshow.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss">the RSS/Podcast feed</a> if you&#8217;re lazy.  Or forget about her dumb website and feed and just listen to a few of the episodes below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/media/funshow/funshow042011.mp3">the FUN show &#8211; 04/20/11 &#8211; Four Twenty!</a> &#8211; I prank call some people that are selling items for $420 and accuse them of hiding their pot selling business.  It doesn&#8217;t work out well so some people &#8220;from the internet&#8221; call in and Aikison continues to spam the show with &#8220;420&#8243; in a computer voice.  Lots of other stuff happens but I&#8217;m lazy so I guess you get the general idea.  At about 50 minutes in, it gets hilarious when we call foreign taxi guy.  He gives Americans some great advice at the end of our show.  Included is an aftershow!  After the show, there&#8217;s a talk with Rappy and his friend Shinobe.  I end up getting my heart broken, but the wedding is still on.  Phractal, my virtual boyfriend, calls in while I am talking to Rappy and shit gets REAL&#8230; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/media/funshow/funshow040611.mp3">04/06/2011 &#8211; Movie Theatre Confessions</a> &#8211; We call up movie theatres and confess to terrible things!  It&#8217;s a spin off of the gas station confessions, but equally as funny.  Guests include RBCP (who broadcasted the show for me and edited it,) Rob the Hyena, LT Matt, and a failing Corwin. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/media/funshow/funshow033011.mp3">The FUN show &#8211; 03/30/11</a> &#8211; Rob the Hyena coshosts.  This is the one that we prepped a prank call and then&#8230;well you&#8217;ll see what happens.  I didn&#8217;t know we were so mainstream!  Then we call best buy but I hate it so I cut most of that out.  RBCP interviews me about my biege boxing date.  There&#8217;s an aftershow but I&#8217;m not posting it yet. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/media/funshow/funshow032311.mp3">The FUN show &#8211; 03/23/11 &#8211; Cat Lady!</a> &#8211; Phractal calls in talks about actual phreaking stuff but he gets bored with it so we call weather girl.  Aikison discusses his dealings with a 14 year old relentless girl who called him over and over.  We check on a guy whose voicemail was hacked last week.  The outgoing message is still there!  Bowling alley prank call failed but it was a good idea&#8230;maybe we&#8217;ll do it again another time.  Snarky&#8217;s at it again.  Skype problems!  Leet fails to be leet.  Other stuff.  Aikison confesses to a guy&#8217;s voicemail.  Snarky. TheN uses a phone with a curly cord. Fix nipples. You can&#8217;t hack iphones. Chris Chan&#8217;s voicemail.  Lady has a cat problem but the show ends.  You can&#8217;t hear the outro music and I don&#8217;t care.  She calls back after the show ends and is going to the cop shop right now! </p>

<p>That&#8217;s Woodstock Pizza in Corvallis, Oregon.  Oh crap, that&#8217;s the only picture of a re-purposed pay phone stand I have.  God, why did I even bother.  Here&#8217;s an amusing picture of a pay phone handset getting the more use than it normally does, just so I feel better about posting this.</p>

<p>Check out <a href="http://1800recycling.com/2011/02/recycled-repurposed-phone-booths/">Ten Repurposed Phone Booths</a> on 1800recycling.com and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/york/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_9118000/9118493.stm">this news story</a> about a phone booth that was turned into a library.  Good stuff!  Oh, and then go read <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/2008/09/pay-phones-are-doomed/">my 2008 whine-fest about how all my beloved pay phones are disappearing</a>. </p>

<p>Some jerk named TheN has created a voice bridge to compete with the PLA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tinychat.com/phonelosers">TinyChat room</a>.  The phone number to reach it is 253-397-1819.  As if people ever use phones anymore.  Get with the times, TheN!  It&#8217;s all about flash-based chat rooms that crash your browser and slow down your computer to 1996 speeds.  If you&#8217;d like to talk to then about his outdated thinking, you can usually find him in PLA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.tinychat.com/phonelosers">TinyChat room</a> in the evenings.</p>
<p>TheN also runs a website called <a href="http://afterthetone.org">After The Tone</a>, where you can leave a voicemail at 253-242-8995 and it will immediately be available to listen to at <a href="http://afterthetone.org">afterthetone.org</a>, which is nice for phoning reminders to yourself throughout the day, but we&#8217;re sure this violates some kind of privacy or anti-terrorism laws and will be reporting him to the appropriate authorities very soon.  Enjoy your freedom while it lasts, TheN!</p>

<p>Any of you Phone Loser types going to Defcon this summer?  Quite a few of us PLA people are planning to make it, such as <a href="http://www.notla.com">RBCP</a>, afreak, DBK, RogueClown, <a href="http://www.thisisarecording.com/">Jenn</a>, blu3b0y, CountyKid, el_jefe, Jammie, ApprenticePhreak, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/thesamantha">io</a>, <a href="http://www.rappymcrapperson.com">Rappy McRapperson</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000221957808">Laugh Track Matt</a>, <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/funshow/">OhEmGee</a>, lmnk, Evie and Drolley.  This year&#8217;s PLA group photo should be a lot bigger than just RBCP and Drolley.  In fact, this might be the biggest PLA gathering ever.  Defcon 19 will be at the Rio Hotel in Las Vegas, from August 4th to August 7th.  Admission is an outrageous $150 per person, so bring lots of badge counterfeiting supplies with you.</p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://www.defcon.org/">defcon.org</a> for official Defcon information and visit <a href="http://www.phonelosers.com/index.php?topic=6235.0">PLA&#8217;s Defcon planning thread</a> on the PLA forums to make plans with us.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a story I&#8217;ve been meaning to post here on phonelosers.org for the past 8 years or so.  The story of some guy we used to have fun battles with back in 2003, just a year after all that insane <a href="/curtis_lee_jones/">Curtis The Superhacker</a> stuff happened.  Both inspired, in fact, by Heywood.  He&#8217;s the guy that used to post funny stories on <a href="http://www.major-losers.com">major-losers.com</a> and <a href="http://www.messedup.net">messedup.net</a> and who I really wish would start doing that again.</p>
<p>The problem with posting this guy&#8217;s story, though, is that every time his story is posted anywhere, he flips out about it and starts making phone calls and writing emails to hosting companies, usually succeeding in getting these stories taken down.  He claims that we&#8217;ve been harassing him or that the stories are slanderous and that we&#8217;re just making up things to try and ruin his life.  So here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do, just to keep everyone happy.  I&#8217;m going to tell the story as best as I can remember it, but I&#8217;m not going to put his name anywhere in it.  Not even his first name.  Not even in pig latin.  Not even a palindrome of his name.  Not even his initials.  Not even in meta tags or hidden HTML.  This is simply a true story of an anonymous guy who I&#8217;m going to refer to as Spaz.  He can&#8217;t complain about that, right?  RIGHT??</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t remember what part of 2003 it was that this all started (it could have even been late-2002, but I&#8217;m not sure), but the whole Curtis thing seemed to be winding down and I&#8217;d become a regular on the messedup.net forums.  Heywood started telling me about this guy named Spaz and what an incredible, uh&#8230;spaz he was.  One of my favorite stories I&#8217;ve heard about him is when Heywood &#038; Co. spotted him in a store and he was wearing a police scanner on his belt.  An emergency call sounded over the scanner and Spaz jumps into action, ripping the scanner from his belt and yelling into the scanner, &#8220;This is Spaz, I&#8217;m on my way!&#8221; and running out the door.  Keep in mind that a police scanner can&#8217;t <i>hear</i> a person at all.  It&#8217;s only for listening.  Also keep in mind that even though Heywood just told me that story again less than a month ago, I&#8217;m sure I completely butchered it.  </p>
<p>You get the idea, though.  Spaz is living in some bizarre fantasy world where he&#8217;s an important guy who has to fly out of stores because someone needs him.  He always had this odd fixation about being an EMT, yet never could seem to make such a seemingly easy thing happen.  He even ran an EMT website back then, with all kinds of information about being an EMT.  (Yes, I know I have no right to make fun of anyone for having odd fixations, since I&#8217;m writing this on my phone-obsessed website.)</p>
<p>So it all starts with Heywood writing an update on one of his websites about Spaz.  Spaz sees the article and immediately calls up Heywood&#8217;s webhost and causes Heywood&#8217;s site to be yanked from the internet.  From what my aging mind can recall, they go in circles like this for awhile &#8211; Heywood posts a hilarious article about Spaz and then Spaz spazzes out and gets the hosting company to completely remove the website.  I like to think that this was easily accomplished because it was back in 2003 when this interweb thing was still relatively new and that webhosts just didn&#8217;t know any better, but I guess we&#8217;ll soon see if it&#8217;s still that easy since Spaz is currently in the middle of dealing with my host&#8217;s abuse and legal departments.  (More on that soon&#8230;)</p>
<p>Keep in mind that at this point Heywood was doing nothing more than posting funny stories about Spaz on his website.  Yes, they were stories that used Spaz&#8217;s real name, but they were all in good fun, there just to entertain fans of the website by making fun of Spaz.  Having Heywood&#8217;s websites taken down meant that we were losing hilarious content about Spaz, Curtis The Superhacker and other random musings from Heywood.  We were also losing all of our forum posts since Heywood sucked and never made backups of anything.</p>
<p>One of the articles about Spaz detailed how Heywood was Googling Spaz&#8217;s name and email addresses, looking for other fun gems on him.  He ended up finding something that surprised all of us &#8211; an old post on the <a href="http://groups.google.com">usenet archives</a> where Spaz asked if anyone had any pornography of 9-to-14-year-old girls.  (I might be slightly off on the ages, but you get the idea.)  The post was made in a binaries group, where people often traded pornographic pictures with each other, including child pornography.  The email used to make this post belonged to spaz and was also used to ask questions about Linux in other usenet groups, which was another thing Spaz was into at the time.  The post was made in 1999 and I&#8217;m guessing that Spaz was new to the internet, just like most people, and didn&#8217;t realize that his post would remain in the archives forever.</p>
<p>Well, not quite forever.  Spaz was able to contact Google (or maybe it was still DejaNews back then) and convinced them to remove that post from the archive forever, probably claiming that someone posted it on there by spoofing his email address.  We were all thoroughly impressed with this feat, because it seems like getting a 5-year-old post removed from usenet would take quite a bit of effort.  We never even got to save the original text from the post either.  Well played, Spaz&#8230;</p>
<p>I think we ended up finding out that Spaz worked at a grocery store&#8217;s bakery when a friend of Heywood&#8217;s happened to see him working at the counter.  (Heywood and Spaz lived in the same town and often bumped into each other.)  Realizing that we now had a way to get back at him for taking down a website we loved, we immediately began calling up the bakery.  In most of the calls I personally made, I asked for him by name and said I was calling about the car he advertised in the paper.  I used different voices and had the staff there convinced that Spaz had placed his 1979 Dodge Colt for sale and had listed his work&#8217;s number for it.  His boss wasn&#8217;t happy about this at all.  When I called her to ask about the car, she began lecturing me that Spaz should not be listing a work number for personal use, and then she gave me his home phone number.  I was kind of shocked at this being dropped into my lap without even asking for it.  We now had Spaz&#8217;s home phone number, which he shared with his roommate.  The next day, Spaz quit his job, walking out during his shift.  (There are recorded phone calls of all of this, which I won&#8217;t share here out of complete admiration and respect for Spaz.)</p>
<p>Of course, Spaz&#8217;s home phone number spread and people began calling him there.  By the time Heywood called and talked to his roommate, the roommate had already decided that he was going to kick Spaz out.  The roommate was really nice and talked to Heywood for awhile, telling him that he was sick of Spaz&#8217;s shit and he was kicking him out not only because of our calls, but because of &#8220;other issues that he needs to deal with&#8221; and that &#8220;he&#8217;s made too many of his problems my problems.&#8221;  This was after just 3 months of being roommates.  The way this guy talked about Spaz in the recorded phone call convinced me that Heywood&#8217;s stories about Spaz were completely legit.  Spaz had some crazy issues.</p>
<p>Since we had so much fun with his phone numbers, I decided to try and find out where he moved to.  I began acquiring phone numbers to random family members of his, asking them all where Spaz was.  None of them had very good information for me, but everyone I spoke with seemed to completely hate him.  His aunt told me, &#8220;He better not come around here because I don&#8217;t wanna see him.&#8221; and his stepbrother said, &#8220;I would never let him over here.&#8221; and also told me that his mom kicked him out of her house for stealing from her.  (We later found out it was for assaulting his mom.)  When I called his mother, she told me that she had a restraining order against him and that the police came and removed him from the home.  She didn&#8217;t seem sad by this; she seemed pissed that she even had to talk about him with me.  She was clearly disgusted with her son.</p>
<p>Months passed and we heard nothing from Spaz.  I&#8217;ve completely forgotten how we ended up finding out where his new job was, but we found that he was working at a wireless phone store inside a mall.  I found a mall directory and began calling all the other stores in the mall and sending them to the wireless store to ask for Spaz.  I&#8217;d use various ruses, such as telling a store manager that we caught a shoplifter who also appeared to have a lot of merchandise from their store or I&#8217;d beg Subway to deliver a sandwich to me.  I think we ended up sending some pizzas there too.  Anything to cause random people to come into the store and ask for Spaz.  I&#8217;m going to have to ask Heywood to remind me how he found out about Spaz&#8217;s reactions to this, but he told me that Spaz would go nuts when these people showed up, and would yell things at the other employees like, &#8220;<i>You see!?!  You see what they&#8217;re doing!?!?  I told you!!!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Around the end of 2003 is when I wrote a perl script that would text random cell phone users with Spaz&#8217;s new phone number.  (I can&#8217;t remember how we ended up with Spaz&#8217;s new phone number this time.)  I ran it for a few days so that Spaz&#8217;s phone rang nonstop with people wanting to know why he was paging them.  This was a time when the term &#8220;texting&#8221; wasn&#8217;t too common and most people didn&#8217;t even know their phone was capable of text messages.  I called his number a few times myself, pretending to be a person who was paged, and Spaz gave me all of Heywood&#8217;s contact information and encouraged me to press charges against him.  Someone else who answered the phone at his house told me I was &#8220;the 90th caller,&#8221; so I guess the script was really effective.  </p>
<p>It was soon after this that we completely lost interest in Spaz and left him alone more or less forever.  Heywood and I would still talk to each other occasionally and we&#8217;d laugh about all the horrible things we did to Spaz.  Occasionally he would tell me that he bumped into Spaz in a store or something and that they&#8217;d talked to each other, but we never tried to track him down again.  Spaz will tell you that we&#8217;ve harassed him nonstop for 13 years straight, but it actually ended at the very end of 2003, with the text messaging script.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s where we come to more recent events, here in 2011.  Once again, this is not my story to tell, so I hope that Heywood will someday write out all the details about this on one of his own websites so he can correct all the factual errors I&#8217;m sure to make.  It was about a month ago that Heywood walked into a bar, not noticing that Spaz was in the bar too.  Spaz saw Heywood first and he jumped up and ran out the back door of the bar.  The guy who was with Spaz approached Heywood and asked what that was all about, then told a confused Heywood what just happened.</p>
<p>The man turned out to be Spaz&#8217;s landlord and he lived in the same apartment building as Spaz.  Heywood told the truth about his past with Spaz and the landlord found the whole thing really amusing.  In fact, the landlord mentioned that he really wanted Spaz kicked out of his complex for various problems, including creeping out the other residents and randomly giving gifts to little kids that lived there.  Spaz had told the landlord all about our harassment and told him that he legally changed his name because of us, but he wouldn&#8217;t tell the landlord what his name used to be.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that &#8211; <b>Spaz legally changed his name because of us!</b>  Today I found out that this occurred in 2005, which was at <i>least</i> a full year after Spaz had any contact with me or Heywood, aside from occasionally bumping into Heywood in public, where Heywood would do nothing more than smile and have a conversation with him.  I could be wrong about this, but I don&#8217;t believe that Spaz&#8217;s legal name change had anything to do with us.  I&#8217;m betting it was more likely because he did something that he needed to hide from.  It makes no sense at all that a name change would do any good against us, especially with him and Heywood always seeing each other.  If we were seriously out to get Spaz, Heywood would follow him whenever he saw him in public.</p>
<p>Heywood gave the landlord Spaz&#8217;s old name and they both had a great time drinking beer and swapping crazy stories about Spaz.  The landlord even handed over Spaz&#8217;s current cell phone number.  Heywood began texting all of this brand new hilarity to me and we decided that the next night&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cactiradio.com/phoneshow">Phone Show</a> would be dedicated to our war with Spaz.  It ended up being a really fun show where we discussed our history with Spaz and Heywood updated us on the new events.  A couple of regulars, r0xy and cyko, joined us, turning the show into a messedup.net reunion.  The live show even had a few extra listeners that night &#8211; Spaz&#8217;s landlord and a few of the landlord&#8217;s friends.</p>
<p>And, of course, we attempted to prank call Spaz on the air.  He didn&#8217;t answer our calls, but we left a few messages on his voicemail.  And I should point out that these were the last calls we made to Spaz and that we don&#8217;t plan to call him again.  We didn&#8217;t give out his number to the listeners and I threw his number away after the show was over.  It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m suddenly trying to be mature by not bothering people all the time, but the Spaz stuff happened so long ago and I don&#8217;t see what can be gained by making any new calls to him.  And no, I&#8217;m not trying to protect myself by saying that we will never bother Spaz again.  If I were worried about that, I wouldn&#8217;t be typing out this giant confession of the horrible things we did to him in 2003.</p>
<p>Spaz was pissed about the prank calls, but somehow didn&#8217;t realize that they were from us.  He thought that the landlord was fucking with him and he began caller I.D. spoofing hangup calls between the landlord and some other guy.  The landlord continued to keep in touch with Heywood, telling him about all the Spaz craziness he had to deal with.  A week later, the building&#8217;s property mangaer called Heywood to ask questions about Spaz.  They were hoping to find lies on Spaz&#8217;s rental application so that they could throw him out.</p>
<p>I stopped hearing new Spaz news for the next week, but then just last weekend, Heywood sends me a text late at night, telling me that he just ran into Spaz at a completely different bar.  Heywood spotted Spaz first this time and walked right up to him, drunkenly asking, &#8220;Hey, Spaz, have you gotten any interesting phone calls lately?&#8221;  Spaz had a meltdown and began screaming at Heywood.  Bouncers came over, trying to understand what was going on.  Details are spotty for me, but I think it ended with Heywood volunteering to leave the bar.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t understand how Spaz didn&#8217;t immediately know that those prank voicemails were from us since he&#8217;d just seen Heywood at the bar that previous night, but now Spaz knew that Heywood had his phone number.  This, of course, caused him to look into phonelosers.org, where he found Cacti Radio&#8217;s website and The Phone Show archives with an entire episode dedicated to him.  He probably even listened to this week&#8217;s show live, where I did a short, drunken update about him.  </p>
<p>All this leads up to the email I received today.  Keeping up with his reputation of kicking ass at getting websites taken down, he wrote my host to tell them that I&#8217;d been slandering him and harassing him for 13 years.  I&#8217;m not sure where the 13 years comes from since that would be around 1998 and I&#8217;d never even heard of Spaz until 2002 or 2003.  Time travel, perhaps, from the time we traveled back to 1999 to plant that fake kiddie porn request on Usenet.  Here&#8217;s the letter I received, his real names replaced with Spaz:</p>

<td bgcolor=ffffff><font face=terminal size=3 color=000000><br />
TO: Abuse Department<br />
FROM: Spaz</p>
<p>My name is Spaz and I am writing to find out how I may file a complaint with your company about one of your hosting customers.  Your customer hosts the domain &#8216;CACTIRADIO.COM&#8217; and he runs a radio show where he has been streaming slanderous content about me.  This person along with a few others have been harassing me for about 13 years and has in the past used web hosting to post websites with false information about me.</p>
<p>I need to know what my options are and whether or not you can remove the content pursuant to your terms and conditions sections 8.11 and 8.12.  Examples of content they host on your servers can be found at the following URL with the most recent being on 03/08/2011.</p>
<p>http://www.cactiradio.com/media/tps/thephoneshow.2011-03-08.mp3</p>
<p>Just so you have some history on this, my name used to be Spaz until I paid a court to legally change it to Spaz in 2005 as a result of this repeated harassment.  If you require proof of this name change then I can provide you with legal paperwork showing it.</p>
<p>It is my goal to work with 1&#038;1 directly to resolve this matter as quickly and peacefully as possible without the involvement of law enforcement or other legal action.  I am however, prepared to go that route if I need to but I think it would be in the best interest to work together to stop this harassment.  13 years is too long and I am frankly tired of dealing with it.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br />
Spaz<br />

<p>The abuse department forwarded a copy of his email to me, and they suggested to Spaz that he forward a formal complaint to their legal department email.  I wrote back to the abuse department, explaining to them that I run an internet radio show whose guest a couple weeks ago talked about the Spaz things that happened in 2003, but I&#8217;ve yet to hear anything more from anyone at my hosting company.  I did email Spaz with a simple &#8220;LOL,&#8221; though.  He wrote me back with this:</p>
<p><center><br />
<table width=75% bgcolor=000000>

<td bgcolor=ffffff><font face=terminal size=3 color=000000><br />
I don&#8217;t understand what your issue is with me since I&#8217;ve never personally met you nor done anything to harm you in any way.  This is a bit childish for a man your age and you really should find another hobby.  I am too old for your games and have better things to do with my time.  One of these days you will get caught and punished for your behavior and then we shall see who has the last laugh.  You can go ahead and say whatever you want about me but your accusations lack any merit and you have no evidence to support them.</p>
<p>Just what makes you so special and better than everyone else that allows you to go harassing people online?  Is it to bolster whatever low self-esteem you have?  It makes me imagine all the horrible things that happened in your life that turned you into a person that everyone hates.</p>
<p>Now, do not ever email me or call my phone again, I have no interest in having any form of contact with you and I never answer calls from people I don&#8217;t know so don&#8217;t waste your time.  If you choose not to respect my wishes then it will constitute harassment and it will be dealt with. Keep in mind that I am documenting everything.  You think you are invincible but that&#8217;s what they all say until they get caught.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br />
Spaz<br />

<p>I replied with an &#8220;LOL U MAD?&#8221; and I&#8217;ve yet to receive a reply with anymore superhero quotes.  Who knows why he doesn&#8217;t understand why I would have an issue with him attempting to remove content from my site.  This is the first time I&#8217;ve ever had someone try something like this with me, so I guess we&#8217;ll have to wait and see what happens.  Hopefully my host will be more understanding than Heywood&#8217;s numerous hosts in 2003.  </p>
<p>I may come back and update this story with more details if Heywood or the other people involved back then decide to remind me of other things that happened.  And I will definitely keep everyone posted on any further happenings regarding Spaz.  I&#8217;d like to thank Spaz for motivating me to finally write out these events.  I wish I&#8217;d written about them back when they were happening so I could have remembered more details, but this will have to do for now.</p>

<p>A couple nights ago I was on a conference call with <a href="http://nickbrianwalters.com/">Nick Walters</a> and he happened to casually mention that Jim Bayless had died years ago.  You all remember Jim Bayless, right?  He was the subject of <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/issue/009/">PLA issue #009</a>.  He was mentioned in <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/media/Mildred_Monday.mp3">my Mildred Monday song</a>.  There&#8217;s an illustration of him in the <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/book/">PLA book</a> and he used to really have it in for a guy named Alex Carbon.</p>
<p>I had a hard time believing Nick, so I started searching Google for any news about Jim&#8217;s death and eventually found <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&#038;GRid=17063953">his tribute page on findagrave.com</a>.  He died all the way back in 1997, just a couple of years after my last contact with him.  His memorial page says, &#8220;James L. Bayless, 53, of Brownsburg, died at 9:09 am Friday in his home.  Mr. Bayless had resided in Brownsburg for 22 years.  He worked for Ameritech for 30 years, the last years in corporate security.&#8221;  He died at the young age of 53.</p>
<p>I only wrote a couple of quick, short paragraphs about him in the PLA book, but as Nick, Adrian and aikison pointed out last night, I should have given him at least a few pages to tell the real story of Jim.  So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to attempt to do in this post.</p>
<p>In 1993, I worked with a guy named Jon Spencer at a movie theater in Indianapolis.  Jon was the guy who pretended to be my supervisor in our initial prank call to Mildred Monday.  We spent a lot of our free time at work playing on the pay phone in the lobby.  Just days before I quit my job at the theater and moved to Celina, Ohio, Jon gave me the phone number of some kid from his school named Roger that he didn&#8217;t like and said I should harass him.  This was long before the days of PLA, where I get asked to harass some random person every week, so I was happy to be given an assignment like this.  </p>
<p>Once I was in Ohio, I began to harass Roger.  I began making collect calls to his house for him, driving him and his parents nuts.  Both his mother and his father angered easily so he was a fun subject.  They constantly threatened me with phone traces and the police, but I just laughed at them and continued bothering them every evening.</p>
<p>While living in Indianapolis, I&#8217;d began playing with voicemail systems.  Telephone voicemail was still kind of new for average telephone users since most people still used answering machines on their home phones.  Voicemail companies were starting to pop up everywhere and I began guessing people&#8217;s passwords and playing around with different company voicemails.  An alarmingly large number of people used the last 4 digits of their home phone number as their password.  Other people I would call up at home and pretend to be with their voicemail company, tricking them into giving me their passwords.  It kept me entertained for hours each day, changing people&#8217;s messages and prank calling the people who left messages for them.  I would also make calls from one person&#8217;s voicemail box to another, imitating a user&#8217;s voice and leaving bizarre messages.  The next day I would check back and hear angry and/or confused messages from each of them wondering why the other was calling them.</p>
<p>One voicemail service had a very cool feature &#8211; when the customer received a voicemail, the system would call their home and tell them to call their voicemail and check the new message.  But just to ensure that this automated message reached the customer and not someone else in the family, the system would ask for the customer&#8217;s voicemail password.  The system could be set to notify the customer every 10 minutes if I chose.  And I could even change the customer&#8217;s home phone number to anything I chose.  </p>
<p>So naturally, I put in Roger&#8217;s home phone number.  I changed the customer&#8217;s password to lock them out of their voicemail and then and called their voicemail and left a single message.  This caused the system to begin calling Roger&#8217;s home every 10 minutes, prompting him for a password.  Because Roger&#8217;s family didn&#8217;t know the password, there was nothing they could do to stop this automated call from happening every 10 minutes.  And because I started this process on a Friday evening after the voicemail company had closed, they couldn&#8217;t even call the company and make them turn it off.  They were stuck with their phone ringing every 10 minutes all day and night, at least for the next 2 or 3 days.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all.  They didn&#8217;t even know what company was calling them.  The automated system didn&#8217;t identify itself when it called them.  It only informed them that they had a message and to please enter their 4 digit pin number.  Since this was in 1993, it&#8217;s possible they didn&#8217;t even have caller I.D. yet.  I called Roger&#8217;s father on Monday morning and he confirmed that their phone had been ringing approximately 144 times every day since Friday and hadn&#8217;t stopped yet.  I pretended to be with his phone company to get him to talk to me about the problem, but soon let him know that I was the guy harassing them, just to hear him explode at me.  On Tuesday, the owner of that voicemail box called his voicemail company and regained control of his box, locking me out.  I still left him occasional messages, though, hoping that he hadn&#8217;t noticed that his notification calls were being sent to some poor kid across town.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my old friend Jon in Indianapolis was getting into trouble for my harassment of Roger.  He had probably let on to Roger at school that he was responsible, not realizing how out-of-control it would become.  He had no way to contact me and tell me to quit, so him and his parents got to deal with Roger&#8217;s family, the phone company and the police.  The police were actually at Roger&#8217;s house once when I prank called them and the cop tried to talk sense into me, but I just made lame donut jokes at him as he swore that I would be arrested.</p>
<p>Around this time is when I was introduced to Jim Bayless.  I&#8217;d set up a voicemail box and changed the outgoing message to say that I was Roger and I wasn&#8217;t available, but they could call my home phone and talk to me there instead.  I&#8217;d been leaving horrible messages for other voicemail users on the same system, which would tell them what voicemail number I was calling from.  They would call back and hear my message, then they would call Roger&#8217;s house to yell at him about the messages.  Some of the users must have passed along the voicemail number to Roger&#8217;s parents, because Jim left a message on it for me saying, &#8220;This is Jim Bayless with Ameritech Corporate Security here in Indianapolis.  I&#8217;d like to ask you to give me a call, please, relative to your contact with the number you&#8217;ve referenced on your voicemail.&#8221;</p>

<p>I was beyond thrilled to have a phone company security guy take an interest in me and overjoyed when I noticed that one of the extensions in his office was 265-ALEX.  To talk to Jim I only had to dial my own name!  I was in the process of leaving my small apartment in Celina because I&#8217;d run up a <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/phonebills/">$15,000 phone bill</a> and was sure that GTE was going to send someone out to arrest me for that huge of an amount, especially since I used a fake name and social security number to set up the account.  I headed south and began exploring Cincinnati.  One day I was wandering around Cincinnati&#8217;s Skywalk and found a few pay phones next to a bank, so I powered up my red box and placed a call to Jim Bayless.</p>
<p>I knew that it would be awesome, saying ridiculous things to Jim as he tried to reason with me, and then being interrupted by AT&#038;T asking me to deposit another $1.25.  When it happened I informed Jim that I was using a red box and had to deposit fake money, then I beeped in the money with my tone dialer.  He seemed completely unfazed by my law-breaking interlude and continued lecturing me about my prank calls and stealing voicemail service.  While it was fantastic having a real phone company security guy rant at me about these things, I was still disappointed that he didn&#8217;t seem to catch on that I was red boxing.</p>
<p>Earlier in our call, when I told Jim that I was Alex and that I was returning his call, he talked to me for about a minute before asking me to hold on for just a second, saying, &#8220;I need to do something here.&#8221;  A series of weird clicks and then having him pick up a completely different phone (the background noise changed) made me feel like I was having my call recorded and traced just like in an old 70&#8242;s TV show with the giant reel-to-reel.  He&#8217;d just need to keep me on the line for a few minutes longer for the trace to complete!  He immediately began asking me questions about Roger and I happily admitted everything to him.  Soon after I red boxed in my money and he didn&#8217;t explode in anger at me, I told him I really had to get going and I quickly left the Skywalk just in case a crack-team of Cincinnati Bell linemen were on their way up to take me down.</p>
<p>Months later I was enjoying Spring Break with my friend Shane in San Diego.  Shane had worked with Jon and I at the theater, and we laughed about all the craziness that I caused in Roger&#8217;s life and how Jon had to deal with all the fallout and, of course, we talked about Jim Bayless from Ameritech Corporate Security.  Shane told me how Jim showed up at the movie theater I used to work at and convinced my old manager to give him a copy of my W2 tax form.  I&#8217;m not sure if he had the police help convince him to hand over the forms or not, but it didn&#8217;t really matter since I was living and working under a fake name.  Jim received a W2 form which listed my name as Glen Alexander Carbon with a post office box address that I&#8217;d closed months ago and the social security number of an old man in Seattle named Alex Carbon.  (Yes, <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/media/Phone_Losers_of_America_0105_Are_you_mad_Alex_Carbon.mp3">THIS Alex Carbon</a>.)  By the time Jim got my tax forms I was living under the name Michael Kelly, thosands of miles away from him.  As we sat in a cafe, Shane drew this picture of Jim on a napkin.  </p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.phonelosers.org/photos/albums/pla_images/jim_bayless.gif" alt="Shane's Jim Bayless"></center></p>
<p>More months passed and I was living in Portland, Oregon.  I&#8217;d just purchased my very first cell phone from a shady guy who often came into the AM/PM store that I worked at.  He was always trying to sell me stolen merchandise and drugs.  I think he even tried to get me to buy a gun from him once.  It wasn&#8217;t until he offered me an NEC cellular phone for $50 that I finally did business with him.  I handed him $50 from the register and the phone was mine.  It didn&#8217;t come with a charger since he probably stole it out of a car or mugged some guy for it, so I had to make my own out of an old power supply and paper clips.  I was constantly overcharging it and heating the battery up to scary levels.  But this cellular phone lasted me for nearly a year until I upgraded to a new one.</p>
<p>Of course, I wasn&#8217;t paying for the service on this phone.  I was using stolen credit cards to make calls on it.  At the time, it felt amazing to be able to carry around a phone at all times, making free calls on it that were untraceable.  I soon put this fancy new technology to work by making a prank call to Jim Bayless in the middle of the night.  It was around 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning when I called his office and was connected to a lady named Sylvia.  I convinced Sylvia that a huge emergency involving phone phreaks was occurring and Jim Bayless needed to come into the office immediately!  Sylvia patched a call through to his home, waking him up and explaining the situation to him as I listened.  </p>
<p>When Sylvia finally left the line, I told Jim that it was Alex.  After a little initial confusion and Jim sleepily realizing who I was, he tried to scare me by letting me know he&#8217;d traced my phone call before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you calling me from that pay phone by the bank in Cincinnati again?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m calling you from Oregon.  I mugged some guy and stole his cell phone and I&#8217;m using a stolen calling card to call you!  Is that okay, Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t <i>think</i> that&#8217;s okay, Alex&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Those quotes are about all I remember from this conversation with Jim.  He wasn&#8217;t happy to be woken from his sleep, but he played along until we finally said our goodbyes.  When I first talked to Sylvia and told her that Jim needed to come in, she told me that he was at home in Brownsburg.  So the next morning I called information to find Jim had a listed phone number in Brownsburg.  Throughout the next year, I prank called him once or twice at home and a few times at work, but left him alone after that.  I would always work some crazy phreaking story into my calls to him.  I&#8217;d claim that I&#8217;d opened up a phone box and had been making overseas calls on other peoples&#8217; phone lines all night or that I was blue boxing calls so that he could never trace me again.  He never seemed that angry with me, but I could tell that my calls were more irritating than amusing to him.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, a guy named kcochran would begin researching all the names that he read about in the <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/issue/">PLA &#8216;zine</a> and Jim Bayless would be one of the people that he called to ask about me.  Kcochran recently told me that Jim seemed very unhappy about my contact with him and that he took it very personally that I called him at home.  It would be less than a year later that Jim Bayless would die.</p>
<p>And I guess that&#8217;s it.  That&#8217;s the story as well as I can remember it.  There may or may not be things about the whole thing that I&#8217;ve forgotten that nobody will ever know about since we can&#8217;t exactly call up Jim and ask him about it.  Rest in peace, Jim!  Soon you&#8217;ll have your <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/rip/jim/">very own spot</a> on <a href="http://www.phonelosers.org/rip/">PLA&#8217;s Memorial</a>!</p>
