    While Ringler styles their podcasts as &quot;news&quot;, the reporting is certainly slanted.  In the introduction to the recent Toyota Litigation episode, the guests are introducted as attorneys &quot;getting justice for the victims ... involved.&quot;<br/>True, the injuries and deaths involved are tragic, but the overall problem for Toyota is overblown.  (It is similiar to the Audi acceleration &quot;problem&quot; years ago that was never substantiated.)  A balanced news report would look at both sides of a controversy.<br/>If the host wants to promote a viewpoint, of whatever persuasion, he or she is welcome to do so.  But please don't pretend that the show is news.<br/>While the shows are slanted, the production values are excellent.  And they do have some worthwhile productions.<br/>But for me, because I want to promote neutrality in reporting the news, I am dropping my subscription.  And I urge you, my fellow podcast listeners, to skip this product.
