			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years countless photography contest have sprung up touting their ability to get you noticed and on the fast track to stardom.

For many the lure of winning a photography contest and seeing their image in print is more than they can pass up, but BEWARE!  If you read the fine print associated with many of these contest you&#8217;ll notice a very prevalent practice taking place, the theft of your right to your own images.</p>

<p><span id="more-515"></span><em><strong>Show Notes</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Nikon D3100</strong></p>
<p>Nikon&#8217;s just announced their newest entry level DSLR to replace the popular D3000.  Announced as the D3100 the camera is an upgrade in every way over it&#8217;s predecessor.  The D3100 features a 14.2 megabyte CMOS image sensor, 11-point AF system, live view shooting, full 1080p HD video and an iso range of 100-12800 when fully expanded.  Word is the D3100 will include a 18-55mmVR lens and have an estimated street price of $699.  If you&#8217;d like to see some images of the D3100 or find out about the full specs head on over to the <a href="http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25472/D3100.html">Nikon USA</a> site.<br />
<div class="wp-caption alignnone" style="width: 363px"><img alt="Nikon D3100 Digital Camera Front View" src="http://www.nikonusa.com/Assets/Digital-SLR/25472-Nikon-D3100/Views/353_25472_D3100_front.png" title="Nikon D3100 Front View" width="353" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Nikon D3100 Digital Camera Front View</p></div></p>
<p><strong>Canon 60D</strong></p>
<p>The 60D is Canon&#8217;s newest piece of hardware and a pretty good looking one at that.  With the release of the 60D Canon is creating a new class of camera to fit between the Rebel and the 7D. Not exactly deemed a &#8220;semi-pro&#8221; camera like the 50D, the new 60D is a both lighter in size and in features but makes up for it with an 18mb sensor and image processing engine borrowed from the 7D.  Coming in at $1099 for the body only and $1399 if you add the 18-135mm kit lens into the mix the 60D looks like it will fit in nicely with the current Canon models.<br />

<p><strong>The British Royal Family on Flickr</strong></p>
<p>The British royal family is now using <a title="Flickr" href="http://flickr.com" target="_blank">Flickr</a>, with over 600 images of the first family of Great Britain online and available for use on your blog, Facebook or whatever.  Want to check out royal family&#8217;s photo stream, here it is <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishmonarchy/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/britishmonarchy/</a></p>
<p><strong>Mamiya&#8217;s Pair of &#8220;affordable&#8221; Digital Camera Systems</strong></p>
<p>Mamiya has two new digital camera systems on there way to your wish list and at a price that won&#8217;t crush your wallet&#8230;to much.  Mamiya&#8217;s new DM22 and DM28 systems will be retailing for $9,995 and $14,995, a pretty good price considering all you get, camera body, 80mm 2.8 lens, Raw Software and the back.  If you need more meat they also have a DM33, DM40 and DM56 however a price on these bad guys are much more difficult to come by.  You can&#8217;t your hands on them yet but November will be here before you know it.  Until then head on over and check out  all the specs and some images of the camera at <a href="http://www.mamiya-usa.com/dm22-and-dm28.html" target="_blank">Mamiya USA</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Not to be outdone, Pentax has 40MB digital in the works</strong></p>
<p>Pentax was actually the first medium format camera maker to step up to the plate with a truly affordable camera, the Pentax 645D.  Featuring a 40 mega byte sensor and a price tag of only $9,400 this camera may be exactly what the medium format market needed to start a boom.  Now the camera was announced way back in 2005 and their hasn&#8217;t been much in the way of &#8220;new&#8221; news since March 2010.  The camera was set to hit the streets in Japan in May of 2010 with no release date for the US&#8230;yet.  It&#8217;s unclear exactly what will be included for your $9,400 but even if it&#8217;s just the body and possibly raw software a sub $10,000 price tag is still $20,000 to $30,000 less than its competitors in that MB range.  As detailed of information as your likely to get is over on <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/news/1003/10031002pentax645d.asp" target="_blank">Dpreview.com</a>, check it out.</p>
