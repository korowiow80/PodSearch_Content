Reduced  demand for bonds that fund most mortgage loans means lower prices and  higher yields on those investments -- and higher rates for borrowers.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rates  on 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 4.86 percent with an average  0.7 point for the week ending March 31, up from 4.81 percent last week  but down from 5.08 percent a year ago, Freddie Mac said in releasing the  results of its latest...</description>

<title>Mortgage rates stable - Maher Muhawieh</title>
<link>http://mahermuhawieh.multiply.com/journal/item/68/Mortgage_rates_stable_-_Maher_Muhawieh</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mortgage rates were little changed this week on news that the economy  improved and inflation remained in check at the end of 2010, Freddie  Mac said in releasing the results of its weekly &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/&#x22; target=&#x22;_blank&#x22;&#x3E;Primary Mortgage Market Survey&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The  economy grew at an annual rate of 3.2 percent during the fourth  quarter, up from 2.6 percent in the third quarter, Freddie Mac Chief  Economist Frank Nothaft said, while the core price index for consumer  expenditures rose by an annualized rate of 0.4 percent -- the smallest  increase since records began in 1959.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Rates on 30-year fixed-rate  mortgages averaged 4.81 percent with an average 0.8 point for the week  ending Feb. 4, essentially unchanged from 4.8 percent last week but down  5.01 percent from a year ago. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage hit a low  in records dating to 1971 of 4.17 percent during the week ending Nov.  11.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was also stable, averaging  4.08 percent with an average 0.8 point, compared with 4.09 percent last  week ...</description>

<title>A Mobile Strategy for All &#x2013; New Jersey Brokerage Implements Company-Wide Mobile Plan</title>
<link>http://mahermuhawieh.multiply.com/journal/item/67/67</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;RISMEDIA, February 3, 2011&#x2014;As the regional director for RE/MAX of New  Jersey, Amanda Brown is charged with providing service and support to  the more than 205 offices and nearly 3,400 agents that comprise this  busy East Coast region.&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;This past October, Brown took the concept of service to a new level,  however, by implementing a mobile strategy provided by Camden, New  Jersey-based Smarter Agent. &#x201C;Everyone is changing and people aren&#x2019;t  using the computer as much,&#x201D; says Brown. &#x201C;Everyone is going to their  phone instead, so I felt it was important for RE/MAX of New Jersey to be  where people are going. I thought it would be great if all of our  consumers in New Jersey could find information about houses for sale  right on their phone.&#x201D;&#x3C;/p&#x3E; &#x3C;p&#x3E;After exploring a couple of different options, Brown chose to work  with Smarter Agent, primarily because its mobile platform could be  utilized across all smartphones&#x2014;such as iPhones, BlackBerrys and  Droids&#x2014;in addition to  standard cell phones as well...</description>

<title>Maher Muhawieh -  Sellers Grow Impatient Waiting for Buyers </title>
<link>http://mahermuhawieh.multiply.com/journal/item/66/Maher_Muhawieh_-_Sellers_Grow_Impatient_Waiting_for_Buyers_</link>
<description>&#x3C;font face=&#x22;Arial&#x22; size=&#x22;2&#x22;&#x3E;Living in a home on the market that must  always be ready at a moments notice for a showing can be unnerving for  home owners. And as homes linger on the market for months upon months,  begging children to keep their rooms tidy, keeping pets hidden, and  maintaining sparkling clean sinks and tubs can take its toll, according  to a recent article in The Washington Post, which chronicled four  families trying to sell a home and how they&#x2019;ve coped with the wait for  buyers.&#x3C;/font&#x3E;&#x3C;br&#x3E; &#x3C;br&#x3E; &#x3C;font face=&#x22;Arial&#x22; size=&#x22;2&#x22;&#x3E;Some of the buyers expressed frustration  with real estate professionals for not better preparing them for the  wait. Here are a few things these sellers mentioned they wanted from  real estate professionals: &#x3C;/font&#x3E;&#x3C;br&#x3E; &#x3C;br&#x3E; &#x3C;b&#x3E;&#x3C;font face=&#x22;Arial&#x22; size=&#x22;2&#x22;&#x3E;1. Be courteous during showings.&#x3C;/font&#x3E;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;font face=&#x22;Arial&#x22; size=&#x22;2&#x22;&#x3E; &#x3C;/font&#x3E;&#x3C;br&#x3E; &#x3C;font face=&#x22;Arial&#x22; size=&#x22;2&#x22;&#x3E;Liz Dordal of Haymarket, Va., says she  wishes real estate professionals would always be sure to contact her in  advance of showings. She has a security system that she needs to disarm  and a cat to hide. Angie Howard of Fort Washington, Md., agrees. She  says real estate profes...</description>

<title>Maher Muhawieh -  Home-loan program hobbled by lax oversight </title>
<link>http://mahermuhawieh.multiply.com/journal/item/65/Maher_Muhawieh_-_Home-loan_program_hobbled_by_lax_oversight_</link>
<description>With millions of homeowners still struggling to stay in their homes, the  Obama administration&#x2019;s $75 billion foreclosure prevention program has  been weakened, perhaps fatally, by lax oversight and a posture of  cooperation&#x2014;rather than enforcement&#x2014;with the nation&#x2019;s biggest banks.  Those banks, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and Citibank,  service the majority of mortgages.&#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;br&#x3E;Despite a dismal showing for the program, rising complaints from  homeowners, and repeated threats from officials, the government has  levied no penalties against even the most error-prone banks and mortgage  servicers. In fact, despite issuing public warnings for more than a  year about imposing penalties, the Treasury Department told ProPublica  this week they don&#x2019;t even have the power to punish servicers for  wrongfully denying help to homeowners. Instead of toughening the  program, Treasury has actually loosened it in the face of industry  lobbying. &#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;br&#x3E;&#x3C;p&#x3E;Over the past year, ProPublica has been exploring ...</description>
