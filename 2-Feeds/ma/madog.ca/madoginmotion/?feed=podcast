		<itunes:summary>(http://madog.ca/madoginmotion/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/DoUC-150x150.jpg)Department of Unusual Certainties (http://departmentofunusualcertainties.wordpress.com/) is a Toronto-based research and design collective working at the interstices of urban design, planning, public art, spatial research and mapping. DoUC operate under the mandate of expanding our conception of what urban design is and what it can achieve.

The Department’s work is informed by one guiding philosophy – that the city is the physical manifestation of a long sequence of unusual certainties, each one simultaneously more unusual and yet more certain than its predecessor. The Department publishes, lectures, teaches, and exhibits often. DoUC (http://departmentofunusualcertainties.wordpress.com/) is also currently the Innovator in Residence at the Design Exchange (http://www.dx.org/) – Canada’s National Design Museum.

<p>Howard has a spark of youthful vitality and a true passion for his art; and certainly he has all the gastronomic chops you’d expect from a top culinary artist. But it is his modernist ethos and edgy, DIY attitude that separates him from the rest of the pack.</p>
<p>Amongst his many creative endeavours, this past April, Howard opened a new restaurant in Toronto’s fashionable College Street West district, called: L.A.B., an acronym for “Living And Breathing” – a 28-seat restaurant that serves approachable molecular gastronomy with a vegetarian bent.</p>

He is currently part of an innovative team of lead scientists at the Terrence Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research at the University of Toronto. His research encompasses the study of how proteins interact in human cells, in order to understand how impaired protein-protein interactions lead to numerous human diseases such as cancer, schizophrenia, cystic fibrosis, arthritis and Parkinson’s disease.</p>
<p>As Igor explains, “My lab developed a unique and internationally known test that can monitor interactions between membrane proteins, the so-called membrane yeast two-hybrid system (MYTH). The system has great potential in proteomics research. For example, MYTH provides an opportunity for therapeutic development by identifying novel drug targets for the diagnosis and treatment of many human diseases.”</p>
<p>The Donnelly Centre is a centre that gathers scientists from numerous fields of biomedical research. This interdisciplinary environment makes it unique not only in Canada, but also in the world research context and enables scientists to broaden collaborations.</p>

<p>As they succinctly state on their website, “Blueprinting was created out of our shared passion for planning and our shared frustration with the traditional method…We decided when we started Blueprint that we had to throw out the old method and recreate planning from scratch.  Our starting point for creating Blueprinting was our belief that if you can’t describe what you are selling in seven words or less, you are losing sales.”</p>

Second City (http://www.secondcity.com/) in Toronto alone has given rise to future comedy stars as John Candy, Dan Aykroyd and Gilda Radner; and later debuted SCTV, a Saturday Night Live-style sketch comedy, featuring Eugene Levy, Catherine O’Hara, Rick Moranis and Martin Short. Later, the popular show “Whose Line is it Anyway” had a mainstay cast of veteran improvisers, including two Canadians: Colin Mochrie and Ryan Stiles.

Joining Steven in the studio for this “Comedy Special” of Madog in Motion are three Toronto improvisers: Sean Tabares, Lindsay Grant, and Thomas MacKay to chat about the ins and outs of comedy improv; as well as how this particular form fits into the overarching Canadian comedy landscape.
