			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dan Frakes</strong> of <a href="http://www.macworld.com">Macworld</a> is back with us to discuss an affliction that is affecting more and more: Apple rumor burnout. Dan explains why he pays so little attention to the rumor mill, the proliferation of apps that makes it harder than ever to keep up, and how he approaches that problem as a professional reviewer. Dan and host <strong>Chuck Joiner</strong> also talk about the far-reaching effect of Apple&#8217;s design excellence and what it has done to industries that have nothing to do with tech, as well as the already-disrupted state of the television industry, and why it is so ripe for even more by Apple.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ted Landau</strong> is getting ready for a trip, and has some not-so-nice thoughts for AT&#038;T in particular, and cellular data carriers in general, about their pricing models, especially for international travelers. Ted reveals some stunning numbers on the potential costs of using data when crossing the pond, and how he plans to deal with it. While not as important as some items on Apple&#8217;s agenda, the hacking and cheating going on in Apple&#8217;s Game Center statistics is also getting under Ted&#8217;s skin; he explains why, discovers why one particular high score number keeps showing up, and voices his thoughts on why this needs to be fixed. Finally, Ted discusses his latest favorite iPad app, and why one feature should be looked at by Apple for the Mac OS.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Tonya Engst discusses the new, third generation iPad in relation to her newly revised Take Control of Your iPad. Not everyone is lucky enough to get one of the latest models, however, so Tonya has take great pains to make sure this edition of her book addresses every iPad owner, whether they are getting a used or hand-me-down device, or just walked out of an Apple Store with the latest and greatest. Tonya talks about how she uses her iPad, her thoughts on it as a Mac replacement, why some see getting an iPad as a necessity in a technology-laden world, and more.

		<itunes:summary>Just in time for the holidays, Tonya Engst steps up to help the armies of happy new iPad owners with Take Control of Your iPad.

Tonya discusses those changes and how she prioritized and addressed them to let both new and experienced users discover more of the power of their iPad. From the new Set-Up Assistant to getting started with iCloud, Tonya will help you take control of your iPad.
