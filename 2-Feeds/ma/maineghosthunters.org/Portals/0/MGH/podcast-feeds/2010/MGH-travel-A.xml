            <title>Maine Ghost Hunters - Old Hollywood</title>
            <description>Maine Ghost Hunters investigates one of the oldest building in Old Hollywood.

We were invited to investigate specific areas of this classic historic building in one of the oldest sections of Hollywood, while we were out in Los Angeles in early 2010. This video isn't about evidence so much as it's about sharing our impromptu investigative experience. This is an invitation-only situation and we're incredibly fortunate to have been offered the tour, and the time to explore this California gem.

Thank you much to those that put us in contact with this awe inspiring estate. We are, and forever will be, incredibly grateful for the generosity that was offered us.
