            <description>Maine Ghost Hunters spent the afternoon hunting down these supposed "haunted" stones. We had to see for ourselves what the Internet rumor regarding these rocks is really all about. Turns out, fiction might be more fascinating than fact, in this case.

            <title>Maine Ghost Hunters - Spider Gates Cemetery Leicester, MA - Mini-Documentary</title>
            <description>Maine Ghost Hunters took a day trip to Leicester, Massachusetts to see what all the fuss is about surrounding this little cemetery thrill seekers call Spidergates.

Disclaimer:
If you are planning a visit to the beautiful little Friends-Meetinghouse Cemetery in Leicester, MA please be aware of a few things. 1. It is not a creepy or scary location. It is very beautiful, immaculate in every sense, and obviously maintained with care and concern. 2. It is sometimes called the 8th gate to hell or 8 gates to hell. This cemetery has 1, and only 1, set of gates, not 8 as rumor and legend purports. 3. The limb on the "hanging tree" is so high you'd need a ladder to get to it. It's doubtful a grown adult, let alone a small child, could reach such heights. 4. The grounds are no longer being used for new burials because the area is so haunted - is NOT true at all. There have been burials here up until very recently - 2008

5. The most important point: Most of the paranormal activity in the past has been reported on the road, which continues on past the cemetery, NOT in the cemetery itself.

When visiting this location please be on your best behavior and approach this location with the utmost respect. Families are still burying their loved ones here, and this place has not been forgotten or abandoned. It is still maintained and kept up on an obviously regular and routine basis. It is not, at all, a cursed place to be legend tripped or visited at night for a cheap thrill. All you're likely to get from a PM experience is a nice long walk on an old road out in the woods. Nothing more, nothing less.
