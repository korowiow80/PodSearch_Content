When mom's got a million things on her plate, how can she possibly be expected to sew dresses for Daisy's International Day or coach her Odyssey of the Mind Team so they know how to elevate a raisin using a piece of spaghetti and a straw in seven minutes flat. We also wonder why--despite an absolutely amazing voice--we never really liked any Whitney Houston songs. May she rest in peace.</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[If you haven't been asked this question already, you can be sure it's coming. Are you prepared to start talking about sex with your child? And at what age is it really appropriate ? If he watches any television or listens to any popular music, chances are good he's heard the words sexy, hot, or even, erectile dysfunction. We admit, it's an embarrassing conversation, even for three grown women! Joining us this week is Adena, Manic Mommies listener, public health researcher, and former sex education teacher whoâ€”through our giggles like schoolgirlsâ€”tells us why it may be best to start talking to kids about sex earlier than you think. This episode contains some adult language that is not suitable for little ears.<br/><br/><br/>All this month, Manic Mommies is sponsored byFruitaBu, organic smoooshed fruit.&nbsp; Put something healthy in your kid's lunchbox!]]></description>
