        <description>Marijuana Radio is the original stoner radio.  This program is inspired by honest thought and injustice.  Do you smoke weed?   Ganga?  Dope?  Herb?  Pot?  Cannabis?  If you're a fan of Marijuana, you're a fan of this show.  Paul the Producer, a proud stoner, serves up the show with pride in doobage and stoney wit.  What is legalization?  Is everything about marijuana positive?  Some of us are Medical Marijuana patients and some smoke recreationally. New podcasts are posted on Mondays and Fridays.   Tune in, get high, sit back and smile!</description>

            <title>Marijuana Radio 2.0 - Rico Colibri, Crystal Guess, DUI talk and 64 versus 70</title>
            <link>http://www.marijuanaradio.com/</link>
            <description><![CDATA[Joined by initiative 70 author Rico Colibri with Crystal Guess by his side, make no mistake, this is historic radio.  You won't hear a more honest counter culture conversation anywhere this week.  We are faced with an epic showdown in Colorado.  Factions are deeply divided about the proper path to legalization, and furthermore, what legalization actually is.  Who is a fame whore?  Who is working to build a career?  Who is an activist?  Who is a lobbyist?  Which is better and why, 64 or 70?  There has been no better proposal for legalization put forward that is consistent with the freedoms and liberties that people should have than 70.  I implore and beg the big nationals to get behind initiative 70 so that it has a real fighting chance.  It's brilliant and this language should set the precedent for future states and their own legalization efforts.  I don't expect help from the people who are theoretically in the best position to do so.  We must ask why they won't help.  We must hold theses institutions responsible if they help to sell out legalization in every state to the highest mogul bidders.  I crave the philosophy to pitch this initiative in an undeniable way.  Forget all the personal aspects of this radio program and ask yourself what the future should be regarding legalization for Colorado's people.  We are fed up.  We want real steps, not baby steps, or even worse, no steps at all being passed off as full legalization when it is nothing of the sort.  Get ready, because these coming months are going to be some of the most contentious in Colorado's meaningful history with marijuana legalization.]]></description>

Later on, we were joined by a defiant Chloe Villano who put up valiantly with many shock radio moments.  This charming lady dealt gracefully under pressure, enduring Paul the Producer's shocking onslaught.  Miguel Lopez came on the mic briefly to tell us how and why he was arrested during the second day of the 420 Rally.  Lastly, we talked to comedian Rick Bryan, and had a rapper guest named Boo the Ghost.  Next we had a rap freestyle challenge out of the blue.  Paul sucked.

            <itunes:summary>Tonight's long episode brought the funny.  The Proposition 19 debate continues with Paul the Producer going way too far.  This segment was edited for decency and it's still pretty wild.  The worst is gone though.  Tonight Miss High Times Brittany sat in for McKenna who was out in Cali.  Early on we said hello to our good friend KOP who gave us the Boston Freedom Rally scoop.   A little later we talked to Green Rush Filmmaker Casey Casseday about his interesting project.  Near the end, we were joined in the studio by Orange Peele Moses who played a couple fun little songs on his guitar.</itunes:summary>

            <description><![CDATA[We had a fun night.  Early on we brought our friend Spencer on the radio who for a brief moment rapped freestyle.  Then we  welcomed Brittany, Miss High Times February 2010 in studio.  Paul the Producer dove a little off the cliff of Howard Stern talking to Brittany.   Between McKenna and Brittany, we had two Miss High Times ladies on the radio.  CelebStoner's Steve Bloom joined us to deliver a fun celebrity scoop.  Local Activist Miguel Lopez came on to say hello and talk about his Marijuana Protest to the General Assembly coming up.   This was an energetic and fun episode.

            <itunes:summary>Pack your bowls for this extra long episode.  We started out the night by saying hello to Erik and Stephanie from the stoner flick High Society.  Next up we said hello to Mike Carroll, a medical marijuana patient with an amazing story.  Later on High Times Senior Cultivation Editor Danny Danko came on the phone to keep us company.  Sam Tallent joined us for a bit on the microphone to talk about Celebrity Rehab and Gary Busey.  Derek from North Colorado Green Cross also came on the mic and said hello to tell us about the Medical Marijuana Harvest Cup at the Mishawaka.

            <description><![CDATA[This very special show features a political race between McKenna, DanK and Paul the Producer for President of the station.  This show features a debate between these three and their respective running mates, Dick Black, Niles and Jesse!  You must tune in to see who won.   In perhaps our longest ever radio offering, local activist Tiny cam on the phone to say hello and update us on his political aspirations.  CelebStoner's Steve Bloom came on to give us the celebrity gossip.  Greg from Front Range Norml also joined us to promote the amazing cannabis cup coming up.  Thinking we'd wind up alone for the night, we wound up instead having a studio full of election day revelers.  They helped to produce a skunky smell in the studio.  There was a very special preshow that was lost because the computer crashed.  However, fret not, the regular show may be the longest we've ever done, and should give you the Marijuana Radio fix that you're looking for.]]></description>

The Activism News and Celebrity Stoner Update were filled to the brim with stories.  DanK had to leave early to do a comedy show, which left McKenna, Roger the Intern, and Paul the Producer to get wild and personal during the aftershow.  The aftershow is not your typical Marijuana Radio, in fact, it's basically a free for all and many of our regular listeners are getting a kick out of it.  Show you're a part of the phenomenon by joining the community forums!</p>

            <title>Marijuana Radio 53 (Tuesday) - Pakelika</title>
            <description><![CDATA[Changing times require tough decisions, and tonight, Kottonmouth Kings member Pakelika came on our airwaves to talk about his campaign to become President of the United States.  Pakelika spoke openly, and to be quite frank, articulated easily recognizable truths in a way that traditional politicians are completely unable to.  This was a fun conversation with some deep thought and a bit of humor.  Later on, our faithful longtime listener Kari came on the phone for what was also an interesting conversation.  Tune in to hear her say, 'Daddy, wanna get high?'  Mckenna sat in to feminize the mix and did a lovely job.  Pak for Prez!]]></description>

            <title>Marijuana Radio 50 (Tuesday) - James Masters and Keith Stroup</title>
            <description><![CDATA[It's with great sadness that I regret to inform all of our listeners that Holly G will no longer be the host of Marijuana Radio. We will miss Holly and wish her the best with whatever she does.  I am very devoted to the show and plan to continue pushing myself to make amazing new radio and tv in the new year.  For a while I will be carrying the program myself until I can find a new female host. We had a strong program.  James Masters came on to talk about he and his wife Lisa's victory to receive all their confiscated items back from the police.  Later on, Norml head Keith Stroup came on the phone for a very thought provoking conversation.]]></description>
