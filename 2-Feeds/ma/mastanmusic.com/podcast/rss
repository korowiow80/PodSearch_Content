HIGHWAY




 

Live in this Episode 63 Part 2 of the MastanMusic Hour, Highway 
plays a set of mysterious road trippin music. Known to  some as a side project of  Dandy Warhols guitarist Peter Holstrom (who moonlights on bass), Rob Bond's band Highway is more than the local rock stars side project.  Delivered in a deadpan, Mr. Bond's cool lyrics  contemplate irony and combine with uncommon sonic landscapes. Don't miss this episode's video single for their awesome song, "T is For Trouble"!

Visit our MastanMusic YouTube Site to see our exclusive MastanMusic Hour Video Singles. This week HIGHWAY performing "T is for Trouble" 
live for The MastanMusic Hour - Club Showcase filmed and recorded from Kelly's Olympian night club in downtown Portland, Oregon.   


The band is:    

Rob Bonds - sings/guitar
Andrew Stern - bass
Nathan jr. - guitar/vocals
Paulie Pulvirenti - drums
Peter Holmstrom - bass (not in this performance)

The Dirty Birds







Live in this Episode 57 Part 2 of the MastanMusic Hour,  The Dirty Birds tore the roof off the joint at Kellys Olympian. Combining retro 50's sax licks and twang punk guitar mayhem with aggressive vocals and heavy duty drum and bass rhythms, they intrigue and probably manage to offend even the most discerning rocker. If you like your rock n roll nasty and in your face, the Dirty Birds are your band.


The band is:    

Jimmi Davies - vox, sax, harmonica 
Scott Swayze - guitar, vox 
Mike Trobman - drums, kickin' it 
Tim Brown - bass, graphics

Hillfolk Noir







Live in this Episode 56 Part 2 of the MastanMusic Hour,  Hillfolk Noir was the second band at the MastanMusic July 11 showcase at Kellys Olympian. Their dark, somewhat spooky sound is a sure crowd pleaser wherever they go. Their charming stage presence enhances the experience in person, but the music shines through on this recording. You'll have these catchy hill songs stuck to the inside of your head for weeks to come. 


The band is:    

Travis Ward-guitar &amp; singing 
Alison Ward-cocktail kit &amp; singing 
Sam Merrick-baritone guitar &amp; singing 
Michael P. Waite-standup bass

Michael Dean Damron  has toured all over the country, (including a tour with Reverend Horton Heat).  Michael Dean Damron and Thee Loyal Bastards have a new CD out called "Bad Days Ahead" (In Music We Trust). As some of you who are familiar with his work in I Can Lick Any S.O.B. in the House know, his tough, no frills approach to rock n roll serves his songs well. But he's not just a bad ass rocker. He's got brains too. In this episodes live performance,  his engaging lyrics and smart story telling take the lead, underscored by fine acoustic guitar playing.  

The band:    

Michael Dean Damron - acoustic guitar and vocal performance.

Brady Beard







Brady Beard says, "I always have the guitar with me...." It shows in his approach to playing the instrument. Rattling off triplets and shuffle rhythms with ease, connecting blues and funk riffs effortlessly while singing his heartfelt songs, Brady is a flurry of musical energy . He came down to the studio and busted out  this live performance quicker than you can say "lickety-split". As is often the case when someone who plays as passionately as Brady Beard steps up to the mic.... acoustic rock mayhem reigns. Watch for  Brady's debut release this fall recorded by Jeremy Wilson at MastanMusic studio.  

The band is:    

Brady Beard - vox/guitar

The newest CD from The Posies, "Every Kind Of Light", is due for re-release this spring from Rykodisc Records. They'll be touring around the globe in support of the recording which began in 2004, when they wrote and recorded the music to 12 songs in 12 days! In Episode 51 pt 2 of the MastanMusic Hour, listen to Ken and Jon sing, play acoustic guitars and discuss the process of recording  "Every Kind of Light". They discuss how it began as a "mostly live" session and culminated in this fine  release featuring current band members bassist Matt Harris and drummer Darius Minwalla. This is one of our favorite live shows and interviews yet; a classic performance from a classic NW songwriting team. Go get it now!   

The band is:    

Ken Stringfellow - vox/guitar    
Jon Auer - guitar/vox     
Matt Harris - bass/vox

This show represents the continued new format for our Podcast. Our featured artists do two sets, so be sure to check out our next MastanMusic Hour, Episode 48 to hear set 2 from Silverhawk. 

Our latest guest to our studio is continual favorite for MastanMusic, none-other than Silverhawk. Silverhawk is the brainchild of the Densmore brothers and their continual evolving collaboration. Sure, this episode may be evidence for nepotism at the MastanMusic studio... but this time, nepotism ROCKS. Silverhawk's latest album "Hangover Bicycle Ride" gives new members time to shine as well as proving that the old hats still got what it takes. The show itself features the lovely, and talented vocals of EVERYONE. That's right, kiddies, not only do all members of Silverhawk sing and play instruments, but Sam even brought his beautiful wife Laura to sing as well! With this dedication to their sound it's hard not to hear Silverhawks crazy psychedelic americana leanings, and absolute love of rawkin' out. Be sure to catch all that they're doing at our latest show 

The band is:
Sam Densmore: Vocals, Guitar, Baritone Guitar, Bass, Drums, Keyboards
John Densmore: Vocals, Bass, Guitar
Rob Allison: Drums, Vocals
Anthony Cotham: Keys, Vocals

Guests:
Laura Densmore: Vocals

Scotland Barr and the Slow Drags 
This show represents a new format for our Podcast. Our featured artists do two sets, so be sure to check out our next MastanMusic Hour, Episode 46 to hear set 2 from Scotland Barr and the Slow Drags  . 

Our latest guest to our studio has blessed us with not only two sets, but a roster of rockin' Americana.  A rarity on the scene, Scotland Barr and the Slow Drags is a full-fledged 6-piece band. The band debuted after Barr's first album "Legionnaires Disease", an album created with the help of many of Portland's top musicians. Over time, the Slow Drags formed and went on to gain national acclaim and loyal fans. Not bad for a band that played almost 100 gigs in 2006 as a completely independent band. Be sure to experience the magic yourself on April 18th at the  Mission Theater  in Portland, Oegon. Scotland Barr and the Slow Drags will be celebrating the release of their latest album "All the Great Aviators Agree". If you can't make it, or want an early taste of what mojo they're dishin', you can get their debut album here 

The band is: Scotland Barr- Lead vocals, Guitar/ Bryan Daste- Pedal steel, Theremin, Sax, Vocals/ Zach Hinkleman- Lead Guitar, Vocals/ Nick Kostenborder- Drums/ Brian Bergstrom - Bass / Chris Hubbard - Keys

The New York Rifles






The New York Rifles started out about 5 years ago, featuring Scott Young on guitar and vocals. The lineup has shifted around him and now includes Sean Moultrie - drums,vocals,  Kari Schafer - vocals, keyboards, guitar, and  Brent Williams on bass, vocals. Their sound is somewhat like a cross between the Pixies and the Rats - heavy on the punky energy, yet strange and twisted with a slight touch of goth guitars and acapella 4 part gospel harmonies.

The New York Rifles have a new record coming soon. We were so happy to host the New York Rifles. This is one of our best shows yet! Be sure to check them out on The New York Rifles Myspace Site

The Lonely H




The Lonely H are a hometown success story if there ever was one. 
They have gone from being 7th grade jam buddies in Port Angeles, Washington to upcoming rock stars, touring all over the country as a full time occupation. Their recent CD, "Hair" comes to us from The Control Group Label and is receiving national press attention. (The Lonely H) "belongs in a stadium full of bell bottoms and lighters raised heavenward."  &amp;en;MSNBC, &amp;quot;Taut live shows swirled with swank three-part vocal harmonies earned the band a 'don't miss this' reputation.&amp;quot; &amp;en;SPIN, &amp;quot;Truly infectious old-school rock n' roll.&amp;quot; &amp;en;The New York Post, &amp;quot;Talk about overachievers.&amp;quot; &amp;en;CMJ 


Hear band members Mark Fredson (Vox, Keys), Eric Whitman (Guitar), Ben Eyestone (Drums), and Johnny Whitman (Bass) kick off their winter/spring 2008 tour in this exclusive live perfomance in Episode 42 pt 2 of the MastanMusic Hour.  Also be sure to check out their The Lonely H MySpace site to find out, not if, but WHEN The Lonely H will be in your town soon. They're on tour from now until forever! Long Live RocK, and good luck out on the road boys!!!

Jessica Stiles




The music of Jessica stiles embodies the definition of "Americana". Her solo work seamlessly blends elements of the jazz of her childhood, with folk, blues, country, and traditional songs from the British Isles. With her "Jessica Stiles Band" she explores more of the country side of things, in the honky-tonk tradition of the late 40's and early 50's. 

To accompany her in our show, she invited long-time friend and collaborator Dylan-Thomas Vance to play. She even managed to coax our own Jeremy Wilson to sit in on guitar on one blues-tinged number, "Two Flat Tires".

Tune in to part 2 of Episode 41 of the MastanMusic Hour to hear an exclusive preview of songs that will be featured on her forthcoming release. Catch Jessica at 10:30 wednesday January 23rd at Laurelthirst Tavern where she will be accompanied by Dylan-Thomas Vance (lap guitar) and stand-up bass player Jason Honl.  You can also hear Jessica performing with her full band live on Friday Feb. 22nd 2008 at Mock Crest Tavern.

Lael Alderman &amp; Friends




Originally from Alaska, and now based in Portland, OR.,  Lael Alderman has been releasing records since the early 90's.  He was signed for a brief while as a "sensitive singer songwriter" to Geffen records.  Following that, he made a name for himself as a rocking frontman and lead vocalist with The Bella Fayes. After the breakup of the Bella Fayes (which occurred as they began work on an album), he determined that a solo career was the path he wanted to follow. 



Taking a laid back approach, most of Laels new CD was recorded in his home studio, with a little help from some friends. Producer extraordinaire, Gregg Williams, (Sheryl Crow, Dandy Warhols, Blitzen Trapper) played drums, provided advice on equipment purchases and studio setup,  and also mixed "Of Birds Devils and the Heart" at his private studio.



Tour plans for the near future will include regional shows with the band, and solo shows abroad. In either context, Lael's great melodies are sung with finesse. His recent CD release show in Portland was a smashing success and allowed him to reconnect with old fans and make some new ones by giving out copies of the new CD, with hand packaged artwork, at the show. "I just wanted to get it out there, " he says. 



Take the time to check out Episode 39 part 2 of the MastanMusic Hour. This is a better than average show, and a great way to preview Laels new CD and hear some exclusive recordings of new, unreleased songs as well.

MINMAE




Minmae is nothing if not prolific. Songwriter Sean Brooks entered our studio bearing a stack of CD's, almost his entire back catalogue, for MastanMusic Hour hosts Jeremy Wilson and sam Densmore. It's an impressive body of work, one that many would consider a lifetime's worth, and all produced within a short 9 years.

While Brooks has always been the backbone of the band, the rest of the line-up, and inevitably, the general direction of the group has seen many changes over the years. 

Minmae's successful 2006 release "Le Grande Essor de la Maison du Monstre" (Greyday Productions) saw them undertaking a grueling four month tour and yet another change in the line-up. 
Brooks and the current line-up (Ian Watts-guitar, Josh Heinze-bass, and of course, Toshiba-beats and loops) then holed up in The Magic Closet---studio that is---to record their latest, "835" , which was released earlier this year, also on Greyday Records. 

Tune is to part 2 of this episode to hear songs from "835" as well as some exclusive previews of some new material.

Underage fans will have a rare chance to catch these guys live, this Wednesday (Dec. 5th),  when they play an all-ages show at Satyricon (insert link). For information on this and other upcoming Minmae shows check out Minmae.com  or Minmae MySpace page .

Still Pending




Local kid-rock band Still Pending has accomplished more in two short years than many bands do in a lifetime, and all well before their 'teens. Since their inception they have been interviewed and played on Radio Disney, and The Cartoon Network chose them to be one of the finalists on their "Props" talent search. The latter won them a chance to record in Hollywood with Grammy-winning producers Antonina Armato and Tim James. 
The band owes much of its success to internet formats such as Myspace and YouTube, where their videos have amassed upwards of half a million hits. And the buzz keeps growing. Grant, the band's drummer, was signed by corporate sponsors Mapex Drums and Sabian Cymbals earlier this year. 
Despite their youth, they are very serious musicians, dedicated to their craft, writing their own songs and rehearsing 3-4 times a week. They're not just "good for their age"...these guys are just good.


Tune in to part 2 of Episode 37 as Reed, Grant, and Andrew treat us to some of their melodic punky-pop tunes, and tell us about their adventures in Hollywood.

THE DRY COUNTY CROOKS




Join us for Episode 36 pt 2 of the Mastan Music Hour. Live guest this week is The Dry County Crooks.

Dry County Crooks are the featured artists in this Episode 36 of the MastanMusic Hour. Familiar sounds, comparable to Johnny Cash mixed with the bold punk rock stylings of groups like Bad Religion and Social Distortion make up a good portion of their set. They take great pride in being a real working band, exhaustively touring and playing sold-out shows throughout the region. These hard-working gents are gearing up to debut their MastanMusic Label release "When Hearts Break", their first album since 2005.  



Having just completed their new recording, we decided the timing was right to have them in for a featured live spot on 
the MastanMusic Hour. Don't forget to come to the 
MastanMusic Label launch party at Portland's own Doug Fir Lounge
on Sunday, Nov. 18 at 9pm where the Dry County Crooks will be 
playing alongside label mates Silverhawk and Tony Smiley .

Listen in on The Dry County Crooks in part 2 of Episode 36 as they talk about the new album and rock out live in our studio!



The dry County Crooks are:  

Vinnie D - vox, guitar
Paul Becker - guitar
Johnny B- bass, vox
Cheo - drums

Leigh Marble




Join us for Episode 35 pt 2 of the Mastan Music Hour. Live guest this week is Leigh Marble.

The term singer-songwriter often conjures images of lone troubadors, plaintively singing their woes, accompanied by nothing but a guitar and self-pity. 
Boston transplant, Leigh Marble easily dispels that myth, particularly with his newest release "Red Tornado" (Laughing Stock Records).  For his sophomore effort, Marble enlisted the talents of drummer Jason Russell and keyboard virtuoso Ben Macy, who, by his own admission knows "nothing about rock 'n roll".  Together, they created a set of songs that comfortably inhabit a space somewhere between punk, folk and Americana, with lyrics that are razor sharp.

Listen in on Leigh and band in part 2 of Episode 35 as they talk about the new album and preview some of the new tracks!



Leigh Marble appears in this performance with:  

Leigh Marble - vox, acoustic guitar
Jason Russell- drums
Ben Macy - keyboards, vox

Luther Russell




Join us for Episode 34 pt 2 of the Mastan Music Hour with Live guest this week Luther Russell.

The name Luther Russell is often followed in conversation by the words "the nicest guy" by many who meet him. The soft-spoken singer-songwriter/producer was as congenial as any of us remembered him when he joined us at the studio for this episode of the MastanMusic Hour.

His latest solo effort  ,"Repair", has already received excellent reviews in the few short months since its release. To produce the record, Luther teamed up with long-time friend and co-producer Ethan Johns (Kings of Leon, Jayhawks, etc.), and by lucky circumstance, Ethan's father, the legendary Glyn Johns, producer for the likes of The Beatles, The Who, and The Rolling Stones.There is an intimacy and immediacy to these songs, aided by the fact that much of the recording was done live in the studio.  The subject matter may be emotionally tumultuous, but it never quite veers into the depressing or self-pitying. There is a sense of catharsis and of taking it all in stride, albeit with the occasional wry aside.

Luther Russell will tour through Europe during October and part of November in support of Sarabeth Tucek.

Listen in on Episode 34, part 2 to hear Luther Russel tell us more about his latest album and to hear exclusive live performances of his new songs.



Luther Russell appears in this performance with:  

Luther Russell - vox, acoustic guitar
Freddy Trujillo- bass, vox
Danny de la Matyr - guitar, vox

Titans Of Oblivion






The Titans Of Oblivion are an upcoming rock band from Portland touring all over the Northwest these days. This 4 piece has been playing around Oregon, Idaho, California and Washington for over a year now and serving up some serious rock. 

We had a great time recording this powerful rock foursome. Their sound is an homage to 70s riff rock Gods; Black Sabbath, AC/DC and Led Zeppelin. The Titans are heavy and groovy, catchy but never sugary, and always sweating it out with reckless abandon on stage.



Titans Of Oblivian are:  

Ron Wesley - Guitar 
Phil Austin - Bass 
Ryan Moore - Drums
Steven Szwaja - Vocals 

Check out these upcoming shows:

AUG  23rd - Blue Moon tavern (Seattle, Wa.) 
SEPT    1st - The Doll Hut (Anaheim, Cal.)
SEPT   2nd - Tim Festival (Anaheim, Cal.)
SEPT    5th - Berbatis Pan w/ Rose Hill Drive (Portland, OR)

Jared Mees!




Inspired by artists as diverse as Johnny Cash and Hank Williams to Neutral Milk Hotel and Steve Malkmus, Jared Mees sings off kilter hooks about his unique reality. 

Several of the songs from his new Tender Loving Empire release "If You're Gonna Swim With The Sharks" were conceived as a result of a "Survivor" like stay on an island in the pacific with his wife Brianne. 

Jared Mees is quickly building a buzz around his songwriting, and his music/art related business venture with wife Brianne.  Seeking to bring interesting music and other art forms (including comics, clothing, posters) to the public, he and wife Brianne are working hard to establish themselves in the Portland art and music scene. Their store front, Tender Loving Empire is located at 1720 NW Lovejoy St., #109, Portland, OR. Support these indie artists! Make a trip and check it out! You can virtually visit them on the web at: www.tenderlovingempire.com But now listen to Jareds great performance in this Episode 29 Part 2 of The MastanMusic Hour

DREW GROW





Portland's Drew Grow and his cohorts bring a  live set of passionate and compelling music to this episode. Drew's experience as a member of the bands "Five o Clock People" and fronting "Careen" (both bands toured extensively and made records with famed producer Joe Chicarelli) shows in this bold and stripped down  presentation of his songs. 



Drew Grow had a devout Christian upbringing that has fueled his song-writing in a many ways. He frequently sings about his personal path in life.  Scroll down to see a live video of the song "Spider" a song about emancipation from religion,  a theme that abounds in Drews work. (photo by Robbie Augspurger Photography)

Well known Portland audio engineer and producer Sean Flora is our live music guest this week.  Most known for his work with such bands as King Black Acid, Morgan Grace, and Sophe Lux, Sean is also a musician and writes and performs great songs. We admire Sean in about a million ways here at MM Studio and think his songs are catchy and original, with just the right amount of Bob Dylan in the mix to make you think and turn on your imagination. Sean also talks about his experience working with multi Grammy Award winning producer, Joe Chiccarelli  on the new Shins  record.

Jeff Rosenberg, Willamette Week

The Tramps



We couldn't think of a better band to kick off our "Rock Rock Rock and Roll
Highschool" special because The
Tramps rock, and they rock hard! With a busy show schedule including gigs
at the legendary Satyricon  this young Portland punk/garage band is steadily
building a local following... and once you have a listen you'll know why!




Pocket Sized Surgeons



Pocket Sized Surgeons are a cool indie/punk band with influences like The Thermals, Dead Kennedys and The Cramps. The Portland trio consists of Chelsea Griffin on guitar and vocals, and the singing brother/sister rhythm section of Nathan and Roxxy Vieira on  Drums and  and  Bass... and remember those names because we suspect that you'll be hearing a lot more from these kids.


Let's Rock Recording Camp Students



In summer of 2006, the Metropolitan learning center held its first ever digital recording class as part of their Let's Rock annual rock n roll band camp for boys and girls ages 10 to 18. The track featured here, I enjoy Horses, Unicorns, and Rainbows was recorded on the MLC stage by the Lets Rock  students themselves. 





Still Pending



Their first CD was titled Innocent Days and to look at these 11 and 12 year-olds, you'd think "aww... what sweet, innocent kids." And although Still Pending may be comprised of the youngest kids featured here, make no mistake, they're some serious bad-asses with the industry cred to prove it. Still Pending was selected by the Cartoon Network as one of only 15 out of hundreds of talented kids to be part of The Cartoon Network's "Props" talent search. The network sent a crew to Portland to shoot a video and interview of the band to appear on TV soon! But these youngsters are already veterans in that arena, having been featured on KPTV's Good Morning Oregon, the Kids Who Rip DVD, and Reed (age 11, guitar &amp; vocals) starred in Cake's music video for Guitar Man! 



Grant (age 11, drums &amp; vocals) has been playing music since the age of 3, and has already been awarded sponsorships by Mapex Drums and Sabian-- and next year, if he receives his 3rd consecutive "superior" mark for piano in the National Federation of Music Festival, he will win a coveted "Gold Cup" award. And multi-instrumentalist, Ian (age 12, Bass) has received an endorsement by Ampeg Amplifiers. Ian, the lead bass player in his school jazz band and the upright bassist for his school orchestra, also plays guitar, banjo, piano and drums!


The Rock Bottom Scoundrels



With their confident attitude, the Rock Bottom Scoundrels declare that they "crank out songs like Barbie dolls in a toy factory." Hailing from Eugene, this band consists of three members-Shane Connor, Max Beeken, and Ben Hartley-and incorporate interesting instruments like saxophones and accordions into their rocking blend.




Yesterday



Yesterday comes from Grants Pass and Wilderville. Though they have only been together for four months, the four members recently took first place at The Ashland Blues Festival in Oregon. This speaks of their elemental expertise and collaboration. Lenea Patterson, age 15, Robert Biscarret, 18, Jeff Morgan, 16, and Kyly Camelleri are four amazing reasons to come down to the show. With an artsy soul and passionate leads, they will steal hearts from any genre.

Episode 22 Pt 2 features a "live from MastanMusic Studio" performance by Greenlander, April 28 Kidz Rock Festival  WOW Hall headliners. Though Greenlander has only been playing together for about 3 years, the members of the band have individually been playing music seriously since Middle School. The band consists of 4 Music majors at the U of O and Lane Community College. Greenlander strives for originality in their sound. The music has many influences from metal and progressive bands like Tool and Dream Theater, to alternative bands like Pearl Jam, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Weezer.

Jonah



By the time Jonah had completed their second release, they had won over fans and critics alike with their adherence to the majestic side of pop music-- something resembling an early U2's passionate earnestness colliding with the hypnotic and dark beauty of Radiohead. Songs from both records had made their way onto nationally syndicated TV hits and garnered radio rotation, as well as landed spots on many compilation discs nationwide. Jonah's  3rd release,  Trust Everyone Before They Break Your Heart was heralded by Spin Magazine as "a gorgeous, lush collection of Britpop tinged with classic Northwest melancholy."




Silverhawk



"Silverhawk will stun you like a beautiful new wave pop sunburst." CMJ New Music Report raved about Silverhawk's 2001 debut release, Flowers in June. And if Quentin Tarantino did an adaptation of William S. Burroughs' western, The Place of Dead Roads, Silverhawk's 2nd release, Westward, would be the perfect soundtrack. On their upcoming, Mastan Music Label release, Hangover Bicycle Ride, Silverhawk proves once again that genre-jumping ain't no thang when you pack that much talent, artistry and daring. One listen and you'll know why Silverhawk has shared stages with artists like Frank Black, Screaming Trees and The Posies.


Scotland Barr &amp; The Slow Drags



Scotland Barr and The Slow Drags deliver "music that punches the heart like a fist with brass knuckles... hits all the right chords with powerful, painful and beautiful accuracy." (The Oregonian)

Barr&amp;apos;s whisky-soaked vocals and emotionally incisive songwriting sit front and center, flanked by a 6 piece outfit that can deliver weepy grooves, jangly tin-pan alley pop, suicidal ballads, garage rock, grinding two-steps and near psychedelic opuses.




Cindy Ingram: KIDZ Rock interview



Generally we reserve part one of The MastanMusic Hour for music, but KIDZ Rock is such a cool project, that we took some time to interview the brains behind the project, Cindy Ingram of Cindy Ingram Booking and Promotions.  KIDZ Rock is a special month-long event in Eugene, Oregon that provides young musicians of all genres a chance to shine and gain valuable performance experience.

Each weekend during the month of April, a different Eugene venue will take a turn hosting a line-up of bands with members under the age of 21. There will be a unique genre and line-up for each show. Over 25 kid bands/solo artists have been chosen to participate. (And all the shows are all-ages!) The big finale show is scheduled for Saturday April 28th at the WOW HALL in Eugene. 


Chez Stadium



of Chez Stadium, Willamette Week writes,  "Songwriter-guitarist singer-producer Randall Payton is as smart(-assed?) as his band's name, tossing clever curve balls of odd chord changes and curious turns of phrase into would-be populist pop. He's accompanied by a potent, sensitive rhythm section." 




Mumpsy



When we heard that Red Hot Chili Peppers' guitarist John Frusciante is a fan of Mumpsy, we thought we should give them a listen. Though Mumpsy is a new band, its founder, Orlando singer/guitarist Jeff Ilgenfritz has been on the scene earning praise for his solo work and being voted "Best Acoustic Singer/Songwriter" in the July 2006 edition of The Orlando Weekly.

Stephanie Schneiderman



A dear friend and incredible, prolific talent, Stephanie Schneiderman's music never disappoints and never ceases to amaze. The House of Blues proclaims, "Schneiderman's exceptional song writing talent and radiating charm are a winning combination. Her honest, earthy presence and rich, serene vocals separate Stephanie from the hordes of 'girls with guitars.' She shows all the potential of becoming a world class, world renowned artist."



Tony Furtado




Winner of the Grand National Banjo Championship, Tony Furtado has released 13 albums and played with such notable musicians as Earl Scruggs, Bela Fleck, Alison Krauss, The String Cheese Incident and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. Tony appeared in our studio in support of his new release, Thirteen, which was recorded at Tucson's Wavelab Studios and features an all-star cast including Stephanie Schneiderman on vocals.

Jonah



Our "Get Through The Rain Special" begins with "Step On Me" by Portland band Jonah. The track,  appears on the Deep Roots Music Project CD #7: The Troutdale Poetry Experiment from a couple of years ago. MastanMusic Studios are producing much of the Deep Roots Music Project this year. (In fact, look for our Deep Roots Music Project Special in Episiode 23 of the MMHour coming out May 7th.) The Deep Roots Music Project, which began 9 years ago as a Troutdale, Oregon highschool teacher's idea to engage his students in English class, has grown significantly in scope and impact-- so much so, that we can't do it justice in this little write-up, so please visit www.deeproots.com to learn more about this remarkable project.



Clampitt Gaddis &amp; Buck



Winning critical praise for their three-part harmonies, Clampitt Gaddis &amp; Buck deliver a beautiful and heartfelt homage to traditional country, every time they take the stage. 
As John Chandler wrote for The Portland Tribune, "Purist snobs may point a collective finger at the group, demanding to see some country credentials, but such an objection is rendered picky and pointless by the obvious care and affection that the trio has for its material. If in fact Clampitt, Gaddis and Buck are merely students of the genre, then they're at the top of the class." 


Lew Jones

Dubbed "Portland's Godfather of Folk" by The Oregonian, Lew Jones is certainly that and more. A published poet, award-winning painter, teacher, tremendous lyricist, songsmith, guitar player and master of any musical genre to which he turns his attention-- Lew Jones is the true embodiment of a renaissance man. 



Leigh Marble



It's true. We love Leigh Marble's music so much, that we're including it on two concurrent episodes of The MastanMusic Hour. Leigh's label, Laughing Stock Records, describes his music as a cross between Tom Waits and Fugazi: rooted in folk forms... with a scrappy sound descended from punk rock minimalism. And we'd like to add that Leigh Marble is one artist whose lyrics warrant a close listen-- so go to his show because his live act is something to behold. But buy his CD because, as Tape Op Magazine advises, "Marble's songs have lots of sharp, unexpected lyrical twists that reward repeated listenings." 


Celilo



Strangers, the fifth track on episode 20, is from Portland quartet Celilo's third release, The Man Who Owns The Sand. Since its recent release, the album has been receiving plenty of positive praise in the press and lots of comparisons to luminaries like Neil Young and Townes Van Zandt-- one listen and you'll agree that the compliments are well placed.




Rachel Taylor Brown



Delicate, contemplative, and beautiful in its melancholy, Rachel Taylor Brown's music will wend its way into your soul, and there it will stay.  A truly remarkable and unique talent worthy of your attention and further exploration.



Carrie Akre



Carrie Akre fronted three Seattle bands-- Hammerbox on A&amp;M, who "equaled the untrammeled rage of their Emerald City peers [Nirvana and Pearl Jam] but also inserted a new wave energy in their typical Seattle blend of heavy metal and punk" (All Music). Carrie's band Goodness, on Epic, was featured on a Schoolhouse Rock compilation with Moby, Better than Ezra and Pavement. Carrie was also the lead vocalist for The Rockfords, which also included Pearl Jam's Mike McCready. We're happy to report that, although those bands have gone by the wayside, Carrie Akre is just as powerful, gripping, charismatic and talented in her solo efforts!

Professor Gall



Drew Norman (pictured at right), guitarist and songwriter of  Portland, Oregon's The Cow Trippers, hired hand for The Sort Ofs (featured in episode 14 of The MMH), and BB's Fistfull of Babies, is also the frontman and creative force behind Professor Gall.



Hypatia Lake



Our next track, from Hypatia Lake's concept album ...And We Shall Call Him Joseph will make you want to rush right out and buy the album... which you can do right here. And as beautiful, lush and brilliant as Hypatia Lake's studio work is, their live show of inspired, better-than-shoegazer-space-rock will floor you-- so keep an eye on their tour schedule! They'll be playing at Seattle's Chop Suey on March 24, and Portland's Ash Street Saloon on April 21.

Grand Champeen



For those of you ready to rock, we bring you a track from Grand Champeen's newest release, an all-analog recording titled Dial "T" for This. LA Weekly music critic Wendy Gilmartin writes that Grand Champeen's 3rd album, "like those before it, reverberates wit hrighteous rock gems, rolling out on fat power chords like the college rock their heroes Soul Asylum, Superchunk and The Replacements used to play. But Grand Champeen are no contrived throwback act; with just enough Melvins-ish geek weirdness to make it silly, this Austin quartet are happy to hang loose onstage, turn the amps up till they buzz, and rock you.... "



LeNunes


Our next track is by LeNunes, the husband and wife team of veteran northwest bassist and producer Tom Nunes and singer/songwriter Lisa LeGros. The drums for this track, "Stop The War," were recorded right here at MastanMusic by Jeremy Wilson with LeNune's guest drummer, Ezra Holbrook.


Leigh Marble



Leaving his native New England in the late 90's, Leigh Marble headed west with a tape in his pocket to join the rich singer-songwriter tapestry of Portland, OR. Soon after arriving, he released a split single with Nettwerk recording artist Erin McKeown, produced by Larry Crane (Elliott Smith, Richmond Fontaine). Crane later helped craft Buttered For Her Pleasure, an album from Marble's witty hip-hop project, the Buttery Lords, coproduced by Marble at his own subterranean Fishboy Studios.





Crack City Rockers



With talent and creativity to spare, the Crack City Rockers are a breed apart, delivering an old-school New York punk aesthetic-- but one that's grown up,  mastered and expanded the genre.

Usually for Part 2 of each episode of The MastanMusic Hour, we invite a band into our studio to chat and perform live for you. This episode is a bit different though. We first began working on The MastanMusic Hour podcast exactly one year ago, and for this special episode, we wanted to show our appreciation for the artists who contributed to our first few shows, before we had established ourselves. If you like what you hear, please browse through our podcast archives to learn more about these artists and to discover more great music!

And be sure to check out Casey Neill's new CD, Brooklyn Bridge featuring the song "Holy Land" which was recorded, mixed and produced right here at MastanMusic Studios!

Mission 5



We open part one of Episode 18 with a track from the newest release by guest DJ Steve Wilkinson's band, Mission 5. One listen and you'll know why The Oregonian proclaims Mission 5 "among Portland's finest ensembles - and quite possibly the most underrated band in the city's history." With veteran rockers Wilkinson from Gravelpit, Roland Klasen from Bombshack, Rick Barry from Haymaker, and The Quags' Craig Stahr, Mission 5 delivers arena-sized rock filled with artful arrangements, bad-ass musicianship, stunning vocals and melodies... this band has it all!



Thrillbilly



Our next track by Thrillbilly is a remix of "Every Day Album Track" that was mixed and mastered by Mastan Music's own Jeremy Wilson &amp; Sam Densmore for Thrillbilly's forthcoming Greatest Hits CD. 


Morgan Grace



One listen and it's obvious that Morgan Grace puts it all out out there when she performs-- raw, impassioned, honest emotion. But listen closer and you'll hear a schooled, knowledgeable, practiced musician with classical guitar training and a love of jazz.  Aso appearing on our episode 18 Morgan Grace track is renowned drummer Sam Henry who's played with everyone from The Wipers and Poison Idea (featured on </itunes:summary>

Often labled  an LA shoegazer band, The Slow Signal Fade prove that the shoegazer moniker only comprises one small corner of the vast and masterful soundscape that they inhabit. Their sound, running the gamut from sparse, delicate and ethereal to intense, dark and brooding, has earned the band critical praise and a steadily growing fanbase. 

Our first touring band from out of state to hear about The MastanMusic Hour and stop in to perform. Lead vocalist Marguerite Oliville and guitarist Ron Ulicny took a break from a recent West Coast  tour to drop by and treat us to some rare live acoustic SSF as well as some recorded tracks from their new, Steve Albini (Nirvana, Pixies, P.J. Harvey) produced CD "Steady."

Blitzen Trapper



National media have compared Portland, Oregon's Blitzen Trapper to musical geniuses like Beck, Syd Barrett and The Beatles-- and with good reason. Having explored everything from sprawling psych-rock to blunted instrumental funk, Blitzen Trapper mix it all up into an impossible sonic perfection.


UHF



We've been huge fans of UHF since they first put the band together in 1998. Even in those early days, UHF took the stage with confidence, and their sound seemed destined for fame. With each passing year and impressive new release, their talent continues to grow with a ferocity that's sure to explode out of the Northwest soon. They've got a new album in the works that slated to be released in April-- but you can get your UHF new music fix at The Doug Fir on March 9, 2007, when they'll be opening Jonah's CD release show!

Reviewing Jon Garcia, Pernell Fowler of Skyline Press writes:

"This sonic journey brings you through metaphorical representations of every landscape and every time of the day while you listen to it. You can travel from the snow filled valleys of Mount Kilimanjaro, to the soft sun soaked plains of Germany and back with the raw emotions that come out with this record. Soft and indie, they still bridge the gap that many artists and albums can't do with their genre. One doesn't need to be a strict fan of this type of music to be able to relate to it and love it, just a few listens will get you hooked and keep you in a soft chair filled with fluffy furs of euphoria that let you fall asleep and dream your sweet nocturnal sleep forever.

Lo Tek


Lo Tek played high energy punk rock. "Nervous," the track featured here was recorded as part of the Live at the Earth Tavern 10/29/79 compilation available from Greg Sages' Trap Records, alongside tracks from Smegma, Stiphnoyds, Neo Boys, The Wipers, and others.


Neo Boys

Described by the Willamette Week as "four wholesome young ladies" the Neo Boys weren't boys at all. They were part of the male dominated music world of the 70s and represented a precursor to the NW riot grrl movement. "Thirty years ago I was wandering the streets of my hometown, Portland, Oregon, when I heard a deafening racket coming from the floor above my favorite record store, Longhair Music. I found the entrance to the building, climbed the stairs, and walked into a music scene unlike any I had ever heard or seen before. The band on stage called themselves The Neo Boys - three or four (I can't remember which) girls ... They thrashed at their guitars as though the instruments somehow pissed them off, playing songs that only lasted about a minute-and-a-half. And it's no wonder. They shot through the poor things at a tempo I'm pretty sure music was never meant to be played at. In fact, I wasn't even sure it was music. I was sure of one thing, though. I loved it." Church of Rick, NOVEMBER 07, 2005 



Poison Idea


"The Heaviest Band Around", Hardcore pioneers Poison Idea were formed in 1980 in Portland, Oregon by vocalist Jerry A. (Lang). The first lineup of the band featured drummer Dean Johnson, guitarist Tom Roberts (aka Pig Champion, R.I.P 2006), and bassist Glen Estes. Influenced by the attitude of bands like Motorhead, the Germs and Black Flag, they were more musically inspired by Discharge and SOA. Their influence on the NW punk and grunge scene is undeniable. "They were as now, fast and raw, they believed it because they lived it. A true Punk band. They continued into Hardcore and practically invented the whole genre. Their influence kept lesser Portland bands going, creating a real atmosphere of punk rock community, (Yikes!)."Dave Corboy, of "Sado Nation", Guerilla Urbaine

Surrounded by Ninjas are Asher Fulero and Joel Barber. Working with looping and sampling software, turntables, and showcasing Ashers old fashioned funk/jazz piano chops, Surrounded by Ninjas create a dark and hypnotic blend of improvised electronica. This magical mix has served them well, propelling them into performances at the High Sierra Music Festival, MusicFestNW, and The Phoenix Festival. SBN have also shared the stage with artists such as Sound Tribe Sector 9, Galactic, Signal Path, Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey, Robert Walters, KJ Sawka, and The  Lymbyc Systym. 

Surrounded by Ninjas  first release, "Realtime Modify", is a completely improvised album, recorded live at the Goodfoot Lounge in Portland, Oregon. "Dual Processor" is their 2006 release, "a gently matured album grown naturally and organically in the earth using silicon seeds, digital fertilizer, and futuristic harvesters". RE:UP Magazine, January 2006 Both CDs are available online at www.reapandsow.com.

Kate Cotter

Kate Cotter started out in Tennessee playing through college, but her musical career didn't take off until she moved to Reno, Nevada.  Since then she's recorded two albums, toured extensively throughout the nation and in Europe, and has performed shows with John Gorka, Kerry Getz, Shana Morrison, Rodney Branigan ("One Man Two Guitars") and Seth Horan (formerly of Vertical Horizon).  Her pure and disarming voice has snagged fans literally off the streets of Reno, who often describe Kate's songs as spiritual or angelic.


Corrina Repp


Corrina Repp is a Portland artist with an arresting voice and the ability to command a room with her live performances.  She started out in 1998 at Hush Records, recording an EP on a 4-track with Chad Crouch.  Since then she has released two more records, both done at Type Foundry with Adam Selzer.


Cumulus

Cumulus was formed by Brian Walker and Aaron Smith in 2000 in Salem, OR.  After Aaron's move to Reno, NV, he and Brian continued to collaborate Postal Service-style through email, working with Steve O'Brien in Ottawa to produce some of their projects.  Portland's Brian Berg records their latest.  Their psyched-out sound is reminiscent of seminal 90s indie rock, with hazy guitar riffs and a laid-back ceiling-gaze delivery.

Nathan Jr.


Nathan Jr. is one mysterious dude in the Portland scene, and we like the music!  His tidily melodic songs wind a tight screw with elliptical lyrics such as "Last night in a dream, she is made of steam, while I'm awake/Crashing into the shoreline by mistake" ("The Best Noise").


Brian Berg

Brian Berg is a man about Stumptown, fronting 44 Long and recording some of the city's best and brightest.  Check out more of Brian in Episodes 8 and 10 of the MastanMusic Hour.

Dan Jones, prolific songwriter from Eugene, OR, is usually backed by his band The Squids. For Episode 15 Part 2 of The MastanMusic Hour, Dan drove all the way from Eugene to bring us some straight-ahead solo versions of his catchy and driven songs here at the MastanMusic studio in Portland.  Dan has been rockin' the buzz since 2000, when he released For Your Radio, which was followed up by One Man Submarine, and Get Sounds Now.  Dan Jones and The Squids came together in 2005, with members from Testface, White Hot Odyssey, The For, Pellet Gun, and The Visible Men.  They consistently offer up fistfuls of raw energy to appreciative crowds, Dan's lyrics racing cathartically through surprising volumes of well-read wit.  We hope you enjoy Dan Jones as much as we do, and look out for a new Dan Jones and The Squids CD this spring 2007!

Dan Jones and The Squids
Midwestern transplant and current Eugene stalwart Dan Jones will be our featured guest artist in Episode 15 of the MastanMusic Hour. These exclusive advance tracks from his upcoming spring 2007 release showcase the Squids energy packed indie rock and Dan's compelling lyrical talents. Dan Jones has been playing on the NW club and theater circuit since 2000 in support of the CDS, "For Your Radio", "One Man Submarine", and "Get Sounds Now". Dan Jones and the Squids are turning heads and opening shows for the likes of Steve Wynn, Dinosaur JR, and Mike Watt, even prompting Mr. Watt to proclaim,  "I'm thinking D. Boon would dig a cat like Dan Jones." We think you'll dig Dan Jones too.


The Ovulators


Formed in 2002, and voted "Best Band In Eugene, 2005" by readers of the Eugene Weekly, The Ovulators' quirky glitter rock has propelled them from total obscurity to Howard Libes' Happy Mistake Records label. Having swiftly risen to the top of the Eugene rock heap, this all female band is currently spreading the word about their debut release "The Ovulators" with unforgettable tour stops all over the west coast.


The Visible Men
The Visible Men are veteran Eugene rockers Dustin Lanker (vocals, keys), Dan Schmid (bass) (both of Cherry Poppin' Daddies), and Jordan Glenn (drums). On their Leisure King Records release, "Love:30", they create a psychedelic lounge stew that resonates with fans of sad/happy pop music.

Yeltsin


Yeltsinrocks.com is their homesite and a more appropriate descriptor for the band could not be found. Featuring members of the popular 90's Eugene band "Buckhorn", they kick out the jams on stages all over the Northwest. Yeltsin have released two CDs, "Yeltsin", and "We Will Be A Factory". Their sound recalls the best of the Gang of Four  and The Pixies to create a frothy mix of  sonic pleasure. "We Will Be A Factory", was recently released on the obscure "My Horoscope Records" label. Seek Yeltsin out. This band is a real find.


Tom Heinl
Anyone who's seen Tom Heinl's live show knows that he's a standout when it comes to writing brilliant songs. With titles like "Morning Wood","Peein' in an Empty", and "Christmas Tree On Fire" he incorporates a wry sense of humor and fascination with the little things in life into his songs. The enigmatic songwriter has released three CDs as a solo artist. His latest, "With or Without Me" is currently available from the Leisure King label.

Episode 14, pt.2 of the MastanMusic Hour brings you The Sort Ofs, live from  the MastanMusic Studio in Portland, Oregon. Their brand of socially conscious, political rock is impressive and intense, fleshed out with unique instrumentation including electric banjo, glockenspiel, and synthetic additives. Led by Chris Robley (vocals,piano,guitar,samples) and John Stewart (drums,vocals) and featuring the talented Rachel Taylor Brown (keys, accordion, vocals) Rob Stroup (bass, vocals) and Drew Norman (guitar,banjo,glockenspiel), The Sort Ofs perform note perfect renditions of songs from their current Cutthroat Pop release "Anxiety On Parade". The show went so well that we made an extra long show with eight songs!

		The Dimes (from left to right) Pierre, Johnny, Jake, Ryan
		After an intensive fall tour including 17 stops down to California, The Dimes are back and set to release a new EP at Holocene on 12/29.  Johnny Clay (vocals, guitar), Pierre Kaiser (lead guitar), Ryan Johnston (bass), and Jake Rahner (drums) play wistful indie pop/rock that combines lyrical verve with lingering melodies and an instrumental savoir-faire that nestles their songs into the realm of favorite mix tapes and nostalgic joy-rides.  Give it a listen and you'll know what we mean.
		
		
	



	
		
		
		
		Boy Eats Drum Machine is Portland phenom Jonny Ragel (Stereocrush) joined by Ben Rickard and Peter Swenson.  No two songs by BEDM are quite the same, as Jonny wrangles his Casio into warbles of joyful sampling and, for all we know, sets it on fire and dances around it in a sort of urban-tribal ecstasy.  A full-length album is due out in 2007.

The High Violets





The High Violets feature the ever-talented Kaitlyn ni Donovan, whose vocals for their new album To Where You Are were recorded right here at the MastanMusic studio.  The band's spaced-out dream pop has set a standard for shoegazers since the late 90s.  Kaitlyn (vocals, guitar), has a new project called Isolade, and continues to play shows with fellow High Violets Clint Sargent (vocals, guitar), Allen Davis (bass), and Luke Strahota (drums).





	
	
	The Village Green
	
Portland's The Village Green delivers a taste of old-school British Invasion rock, first with their eponymous EP in 2005 and this year with a full-length album, Feeling the Fall, recorded in grand PDX style in producer/drummer Jeremy Sherrer's basement.  Their sexy, Kinks-flavored songs are fresh and confidently catchy.  J. Nicholas Allard sings, Nathan Anderson plays keys and guitar, and Dave Depper plays bass, with the aforementioned Sherrer on drums.

	
	


	
	
	
		
		The Turn-Ons

Blue Skies for Black Hearts are gearing up for a spring West Coast tour after the release of their latest, Love is Not Enough.  Pat Kearns (vocals, guitar), Michael Lewis (guitar, vocals), Kelly Simmons (bass, vocals), and Matthew Morgan (drums) pull together with music that is half earnest love and heartbreak and half ironic anti-romance.

Lael Alderman, originally from Eugene, is writing great songs these days after past bands Lael Leroy &amp; the Loved and The Bella Fayes came to peaceful ends.  His music has turned heads since his debut solo album SlowDrag, which landed a song on the Permanent Midnight soundtrack and a major-label deal.  Throughout the chaos of entertainment-biz politics, Lael has stayed true to his aggressively pensive and stylish songs. Having flirted with fame and successfully disentangled himself from legal fiascos which almost laid claim to his own name, he's settled in Portland and is sounding better and happier than ever with his signature poetic rock.

		Viva Voce
		
		Viva Voce's husband and wife team of Anita and Kevin Robinson
		We start and end Part 1 with Viva Voce. They are husband-and-wife team Kevin and Anita Robinson, who made Portland their hometown in 2001 by way of Muscle Shoals, AL. In what could rightfully be called purely 21st-century indie pop/post-rock, they've created a smooth blend of freewheeling psych tapestry on their latest album Get Yr Blood Sucked Out on Barsuk Records. It's their first release on the Seattle-based label after prior releases on their own label, Amore!Phonics, and their 2004 follow-up, The Heat Can Melt Your Brain (Minty Fresh), which garnered considerable international attention.
		
		
	



	
		
		
		
		Next up are The Shins, big enough to land prime spots on mainstream film and TV, and cool enough to have played at 2004's PDX Pop Now!, which is where we get our track for this episode. Their next album, Wincing the Night Away, is slated for January 2007 release on SubPop.

John Weinland is a local songwriting group which includes John Adam Weinland Shearer (vocals, guitar), Aaron "Rantz" Pomerantz (dobro, mandolin, vibes, lap steel, accordion), Rory Brown (bass), Ian Lyles (drums, percussion, banjo) and Paul Christensen (keyboards). Their 2006 album Demersville is a collection of wistful, delicately executed folkish songs, on which Adam Selzer (Norfolk and Western, M Ward), who also produced the album at Type Foundry, and Rachel Blumberg (Norfolk and Western, M Ward, The Decemberists) make guest appearances.

	"What Zaphod Beeblebrox was to Intergalactic alcoholism Dr. Theopolis is to gettin' down." So sayeth Ezra Holbrook of the 8-piece rap/funk/R&amp;B ensemble that is Dr. Theopolis. The collaboration includes Portland musicians whose projects include The Decemberists, Lael Alderman, and The American Girls, as well as Little Sue, our own Jeremy Wilson, Wyatt Herb, and Rollie Tussing, to name a few. They've got two albums out, The Voice Of The Future (2002) and Astronomical (2004), on the Pimpbionic label, and have plans for a third.
	
	


	
	
	
		
		The Turn-Ons
		
		
	
	
	After 9 eventful years that included shows with bands such as The Strokes, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and Imperial Teen, as well as critical acclaim for their previous releases, Seattle's The Turn-Ons recorded their latest album, Parallels, with producer Paul Mahajan (The Yeah Yeah Yeahs, T.V. On the Radio). Their catchy brand of space-glam-Brit rock has been turning heads in the US and abroad.
	
	
	


	

	
	Floater
	

Portland art-metal trio Floater just released their eighth LP, Stone By Stone, which features refined and stylish guitar work by Dave Amador against the signature sound that Rob Wynia (vocals, bass) and Pete Cornett (drums) have developed since 1993.

Episode 12 Part 2 of the MastanMusic Hour is a retrospective on the music of Mike Coykendall. He's been a Portland fixture in indie rock since his move from San Francisco in 1999, where he founded The Old Joe Clarks with his wife Jill in 1994. Besides having released over 15 albums of original music since 1986 through The Old Joe Clarks and Klyde Konnor, Mike has produced some of the Northwest's most noteworthy music in the past decade, recording Richmond Fontaine, Beth Orton, M Ward, and Tin Hat Trio in his home studio. His latest and first solo album, Hello Hello Hello, is an elegant collection of hypnotic songs that marry musical ingenuity with lyrical eloquence and maturity. You can listen to it in full now at his website www.mikecoykendall.com or at Stereotype Records. Mike is playing with an amazing band these days with Scott "Foggy" Hampton - Lead Guitar, Vocals, Nathan Jr. - Keys, Vocals, Scott Demay - Drums &amp; Percussion, Matt Brown - Bass, Vocals and Mark Orton - Lap Steel, Guitar, Keys, Vocals.

Part 1 of Episode 11 is a mix of tracks from bands who've sent us CDs and some favorites from our archives, with The Snakebites, The Fastbacks, Titans of Oblivion, The Heise Bros., Mike Coykendall, Dave Stoops, and Cavemanish Boys.  We like to keep things fresh and minty, so keep the music coming, mail us your recordings or email us your band info and links to your music to be featured on the MastanMusic Hour.

The Snakebites are a Seattle band with a burning take on rock'n'roll, self-described as "The Carpenters on speed."  Skky Phoenix and Starr Harris chew retro-mod up and spit it out like punk rock in a garage.  They've got a new album out, "love. hate. rage &amp; sorrow." on Silver Bell Records.

The Fastbacks.  You know them, you love them.  We've got them doing a Sammy Hagar/Ronnie Montrose track off of their 1996 album "New Mansions in Sound."

Titans of Oblivion are back on the MastanMusic Hour!  One of our favorite new Portland bands too, (see Episode 8 Part 1) bring arena rock from its mighty throne back down to indie earth.

The Heise Bros. are Nelson and Robert Heise from Minneapolis.  Branching out from a previous collaboration, Munkey Juice, the brothers have released two albums of gritty psychedelic americana influenced by The Velvet Underground, The Kinks, Pixies and Camper Van Beethoven.

Next up is Mike Coykendall, who'll  be featured in the live segment of the MastanMusic Hour in Episidoe 12 available December 4th.  A local luminary known, among many things, for his work in his home studio recording M Ward, Richmond Fontaine, Beth Orton, Tin Hat Trio, and Bright Eyes, as well as for his previous San Francisco band, Old Joe Clarks. He's recorded a new album on Stereotype Records that is not to be missed called Hello Hello Hello.  Check him out here live on the next MastanMusic Hour.

Dave Stoops' album "Spill Your Drink" was produced by Brian Berg, featured in Episode 10 Part 2.  The music is an artful blend of melodic hooks, Liverpoolish beats, and earnest pop vocals, with Brian's punchy instrumental talents laced throughout.

Gerry Mohr of the legendary Miracle Workers joins Jim Talstra (Minus 5, No.2, Dharma Bums), John Moen (Decemberists, Stephen Malkmus, Dharma Bums) and Chris Slusarenko (Guided by Voices, Sprinkler, Svelt, Off Records) bringing us Cavemanish Boys, an unapologetic garage revival band that spins through conventions of rock in a frenzied snarl.  The album "Get a Load of the Cavemanish Boys" is a nod to David Bowie's first band, and while it has a different sound altogether, it carries the same neoteric energy of a band with a clear and caustic message.

Rollie Tussing is known for giving rousing solo performances weekly at Imbibe and Mock Crest Tavern here in Portland.  As a one-man band, Rollie fills a room with his soulful, growling vocals and rollicking performances on cigar box, steel, and electric guitars, keeping beat all the while on kick drum and various percussive accessories.  Winner at the 2001 National Slide Guitar Competition, Rollie is also a keeper of folk history, delving deep into the history of the blues and American folk music, traveling the South and archiving recordings and traditions.  Sit back with us and enjoy Part 2 of Episode 11 as Rollie Tussing shares a set of his porchlight wizardry and tells some great stories.

Mark Twain Indians are a promising Portland band formed in 2005 as a collaboration between John Elkins, Dylan Hall, Nic Moen, Ted Easton, and John Mcillup.  Their debut album "Gap Between the Rich and the Poor" is a polished, nostalgic indie gem.

Kind Of Like Spitting made its debut in 2000 with four full-length, decidedly independent releases.  Ben Barnett has since seen band members come and go through a door revolving around his own steadily nonchalant artistic vision.  Barnett's lyrical bluntness and poignant songwriting have gained comparisons to Billy Bragg and Mark Eitzel.

Jon Garcia's music has been described by Playback Magazine as "a gentle lullaby, one that Ryan Adams might listen to before bed."  He truly has one of the loveliest voices we've had the fortune to hear of late.



Another new Portland band we'd like to introduce is Swim Swam Swum.  Their raw, post-emo brand of music takes a carefree approach to songwriting, rocking out with youthful exuberance.  Matt Taylor's on vocals and guitar, Clint Cunningham on bass, and Seth Denlinger plays drums.

This week's episode also features a track from New York's The Hold Steady, from their album "Separation Sunday."  After moving to NYC from Minneapolis in 2000, vocalist/guitarist Craig Finn (Lifter Puller) along with fellow ex-Lifter Puller Tad Kubler, drummer Judd Counsell, and bassist Galen Polivka convened to create jaunty back-alley story-tunes akin to The Pixies and the Replacements.

Rounding out our playlist is Paper Cameras, a four-piece from Portland whose music draws inspiration from new wave and glam-punk.  Michael Carothers's (All the Dead Horses, Spectator Pump, Wishing Post w/Hank III) songwriting channels the righteous raucousness and wistful aggression of neo-glam rock.

Episode 10 Part 2 features Brian Berg of the band 44 Long, live in our studio playing from their latest album, Hangover Heights Part 2.  Brian can lay claim to being a rare master of rock, blending the sounds of country, roots rock, and pop to create well crafted and heartfelt songs.  Since their debut release Collect Them All (1997), followed by Inside the Horse's Head in 1999, 44 Long has snagged the attention of rock reviewers for Rolling Stone and Billboard magazines, among other national publications.  Brian returned to his studio with guitarist Andy Ricker and drummer Cory Burden and released Hangover Heights Part 2 in May 2006.  HH Part 1 is slated for release in December 2006.  We hope you enjoy this week's exclusive live set from Portland's veteran iconoclast, Brian Berg.

Part 1 of Episode 9 is a special showcase of artists on In Music We Trust Records. And sitting in as a guest DJ to tell you all about it is In Music We Trust founder, and bastion of indie cred, Alex Steininger.

Chris Tsefalas collaborates with John Moen (Maroons, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, Elliott Smith) and famed Portland producer Larry Crane of Jackpot! Records to bring us the infectiously catchy tunes on his latest album, "I'm All Right?"

John Moen's own group The Maroons brings a dose of verve to the realm of indie pop with their intoxicating melodies and reverie-inducing hooks.  Bringing their talents to the table with The Decemberists' Moen are Mike Clark (Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks), Jim Talstra (Minus 5), John Cox (Satan's Pilgrims), and Eric Bennes.



Next up is LA's The Slow Signal Fade, who create a tidal wave of sound that's got us gazing pretty happily at our shoes.  Their tunneling, dark, cinematic vibe has been brought to recorded life by producer Steve Albini (Nirvana, Pixies, PJ Harvey).  The SSF is Marguerite Olivelle (vocals), Aaron Vishria (drums), Chris Walters (bass), and Ron Ulicny (guitar).



In the best sense of the word, is Portland's own I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch In The House., who will throw you straight back to a time when rock didn't just roll, it barreled at you and knocked your ass down in a mullets-flying barroom brawl.  Since 2002, Mike D, Handsome Jon, Mole Harris, Flapjack Texas, and David Lipkind have cut through the local scene with loud, no-nonsense blue collar rock.


Part 1 of Episode 9 begins and ends with  Fernando, who has been a Portland gem for the past 12 years, writing music that distills multiple rock and pop forms into a fresh and unique sound. This week's episode features two songs from Fernando's (a moniker which includes Lewi Longmire, Paul Brainard, Qwee, and eels' Jeff Lyster and Derek Brown) latest album, "Enter to Exit," a tour de force of lush harmonies and unapologetically melancholy songwriting that has had critics singing their praises.

In Episode 6 we introduced you to the powerful Russian rock of Umka. Here in Episode 9 of The MastanMusic Hour, we bring you a more intimate and stripped down live session with Umka's frontwoman, Anna Gerasimova, and lead guitarist, Boris Kannunikov. Umka ("a smart girl who's like a little bear") was a nickname given to Anna Gerasimova in 1986 during the Soviet hippie revival.  Twenty years, 400 songs, and around twenty self-released recordings later, Umka has evolved under different names (Bronevichok, Bronevik, and Bro) and on indie label Otdelenie Vykhod, promoting the themes of friendship and poetry in songwriting evocative of rock and folk of the 60s and 70s.  They've played around the world, from Siberia to Oregon, all for the grand purpose of rockin' out.  Their philosophy is simple; in Anna's words: "We've got no managers, no promoters, no producers, no press agents, no radio play, just plenty of friends all over the world, who are eager to help."

In Episode 8 Part 1 of the MastanMusic Hour, we feature a musical boot camp of Portland's finest and freshest, as well as sounds from the distant land of southern California.  We're happy to present Brian Berg's 44 Long, who have been called everything from indie pop to swamp rock by critics and fans.  The resulting musical alchemy has made them the darling darkhorse of Portland's music community since their first release in 1997.







Next up are Titans of Oblivion, whose formidable arena-rock soundwaves invoke the rock gods of the 60s and 70s.  Set to spread the mandate through the Northwest are Ron Wesley on guitar, Phil Austin on bass, Ryan Moore on drums, and vocalist Steven Szwaja.






The multitalented  Kaitlyn ni Donovan has been a Portland music icon since her debut in 1999, sweetening our eardrums with her noirish lyrics and elegant vocals.  A native daughter by way of Alaska, Kaitlyn has released solo material as well as collaborative works with The High Violets and her newest band Isolade, which includes the talents of Shawna McKeown, David Glide, and Sean Moultrie.





From Laguna Beach, CA, we welcome one of SoCal's top 10 unsigned bands, Vendetta Valentine.  The sound is a happy marriage of indie rock, electro pop, and new wave, topped off with a punkish delivery.  Formed in early 2006 as a collaboration between Thomas M, D. Powell, and Anna Judd, their postmodern pop verve has landed them rotation on Los Angeles radio giant KROQ and a national tour over the summer.




"So good that it's edible"-we hope you find Telephone as delicious as we do.  Telephone is the synth-rock, post-punk brainchild of Eric Hedford, one of the founding members of The Dandy Warhols.  Scott Fox of punk-pop Portland trio Crackerbash wields the axe, Juliette Jones plays bass, and former Elliott Smith drummer Paulie Pulvirenti round out Telephone's wall of synth rhapsodies.  Eric can be spotted weekly at the Goodfoot here in Portland as DJ Aquaman.





And this week we're proud to introduce to our listeners to one of Portland's favorite new bands, The Sort Ofs.  Chris Robley (The Imprints) and John Stewart join up with Rob Stroup (Baseboard Heaters), Rachel Taylor Brown, and Drew Norman.  Their impressive debut album, "Anxiety on Parade," (March 2006) follows on the heels of Chris's raved-over EP release, "This Is The," under the name Chris Robley &amp; The Fear of Heights.  The Sort Ofs are the indie kid's anti-military marching band, or, in their words: "agitprop-POPulism for the individual."  The music is a blend of anything from Burt Bacharach to Nirvana, executed with meticulous abandon.  Keep an ear out for a live feature Podcast here on the MastanMusic Hour with these talented musical do-gooders.

Episode 8 Part 2 of MastanMusic Hour features Kara Suzanne who brings the backcountry to the big city in her wistful, twangy songs.  A Manhattan expatriate from McMinnville, OR, Kara has built a solid repertoire of bluegrass-infused melodies that are personal and intimate, yet refreshingly free of cloying sentimentality.  Her voice has been likened to those of Kay Starr, Emmylou Harris, and Dolly Parton, with guitar talents to match.  Kara has recently formed a band called The Gojo Hearts with pianist Aya Kato from Japan, and is collaborating on her first full-length album with Bryan Pugh, guitarist and singer-songwriter Putnam Murdock, bassist Calvin Bennett, and percussionist Jay Frederick.  The Gojo Hearts can be seen performing at venues in NYC such as Southpaw, Rockwood Music Hall, Knitting Factory, CBGB's, Galapagos and Detour.

Episode 7 Part 1 of MastanMusic Hour features some of the diverse sounds that helped to garner Portland's reputation as a mecca for music. First up we've got Thrillbilly whose raucous punk-meets-country sound began earning them a following a decade ago. Then we introduce you to the melodic indie-rock of former Geffen recording artist, talented singer-songwriter, Lael Alderman.  

During the past twelve years in which Argentina-born  Fernando has called Portland home, his sound has melded his latin roots with rock, R&amp;B and the distinctive country tinged Americana that has helped put Portland on the musical map.


And we're excited to introduce you to some new music too. We had a band personally drop by a cd which we think you ought to hear. WNDRKND is the vanity project of Aghastus von Latimer-Dorney III whose aspiration with WNDRKND is to make drug music for squares.

Episode 6 Part 1 of MastanMusic Hour begins with the musical evolution of Matt Sheehy. From playing punk rock in Juneau, Alaska with drummer Jarhid Brown, to performing as Portland, Oregon power duo Gravity and Henry, to fronting his own band, Matt Sheehy has developed into one of Portland's most emotive and creative artists. His soaring, powerful vocals, richly textured, looped and layered arrangements create a riveting listening experience.

With their roots in punk and shredding guitar rock, Tom Rigney and Tim Reedy, formerly of NY cult faves the Moths now perform under the moniker Electric Engine. If you haven't heard these guys before-- we're damn glad to turn you on to them because no matter what name they're performing under, these guys rock!



With nearly 20 albums and 400 songs to their credit the Russian band  Umka is led by  frontwoman Anna Gerasimova, who is also credited with translating Kerouac's "The Dharma Bums" into Russian and introducing the entire former Soviet Bloc to Jack's take on freedom! There are kick-ass bands all over the world, and every now and then you find one that's so good it doesn't matter that you can't understand what they're saying. Umka is that good.

	Episode 5 Part 2 of MastanMusic Hour focuses on two amazingly talented artists, Casey Neill and  Hanz Araki.

Casey Neill's whiskey soaked vocals, well-crafted songs and devotion to the emotional center of the material, has been the foundation of his career on the cutting edge of American roots music.

Hanz Araki is not only a gifted flautist and vocalist, but also the world's only sixth generation shakuhachi (the traditional bamboo "Zen flute" of Japan) player... one with a penchant for Celtic music! Hanz was flautist and vocalist with The Paperboys when they won the 1997 Canadian Juno Award for Best Folk Roots album.

	Loop pedal ninja Tony Smiley has a playing style that often catches people off guard.  Over the past few years he has created a one man band sound that mixes up funk, folk and grunge with beatbox and a dash of Mongolian Throat singing.

In the studio and in performance Tony builds his songs one loop at a time.  Unlike most loop pedal artists, he doesn&amp;apos;t use any pre-recorded loops.  He generally starts with a rhythm guitar track, then adds a bass line.  He steps up to the mike and beatboxes his own drum track.  Next comes a lead riff on guitar.  And then he starts singing, passionate, abstract songs that audiences immediately connect with emotionally.  With all his loops firing like a well oiled machine he is free to unleash a barrage of wah pedal funk, crunchy distortion or flurries of fretboard riffs..
