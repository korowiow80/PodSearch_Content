As usual, the best way to get it is to subscribe it using iTunes. Just look on the iTunes Store for "Max Sanna", and you'll get it delivered automatically every month as soon as it comes out. It doesn't get much easier than that :)

This is the February playlist:

	Soulsearcher - Can't Get Enough (Henrik B Remix)
	DCA Project - Sandcastles (John Dahlback Remix)
	Wheels &#x38; Disco - Good Times ft. Mighty Marvin (Denis The Menace Vocal Rmx)
	Juan Kidd &#x38; Felix Baumgartner - Now You're Gone feat. Lisa Millett (Club Mix)
	Ladyhawke - Paris Is Burning (Kim Fai Remix)
	Richard Grey, Erick Morillo &#x38; Jose Nunez - Life Goes On 2009 feat. Shawnee Taylor
	Greg Cerrone feat. Andy P - Taking Control Of You (Original Dub Mix)
	Dada, Obernik &#x38; Harris - Stereo Flo (The Drill Remix)
	Kleerup With Titiyo - Longing For Lullabies (Shapeshifters Nocturnal Groove)
	Clearcut - Breathless (Deadmau5 Vocal Mix)
	Sundown - Sleepover It (Original Mix)
	Egostereo - Lost In Sahara (Original Mix)
	Jean Elan - Shake Me (Original Mix)
	Arnej - Strangers We've Become (The Ones That Get Away)
	Giorgio Giordano - Amazzonia (David Tort Tech Mix)
	Slam - Ghost Song (Joris Voorn Remix)
	Olivier Giacomotto - Guacamoli (Original Mix)

	Christian Smith &#x38; John Selway - Swingworld (Paul Ritch Remix)
	Paul Ritch - Evil Laff (Original Mix)
	Timo Maas - Subtellite (Sharam Remix)

Here&#8217;s the first episode of 2009, which will open the new year with some fresh sounds for your iPod!

<p>Here&#8217;s the first episode of 2009, which will open the new year with some fresh sounds for your iPod!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of a special episode, I&#8217;d define it quite &#8220;esotic&#8221;, as you&#8217;ll notice while listening through it: many of the tracks feature long breakdowns filled with oriental flutes, sitars, strings and arabic chants, before throwing you back in dark and powerful beats.</p>
<p>Also, this episode is a tribute to one of the best italian DJs: Joe T Vannelli and his bomb tracks rocking Milan&#8217;s club scene (my Italian listeners surely know his great night that went on for years, Supalova Club, the only event able to pack a club to capacity on a Thursday night). I played 3 of his latest tracks, and while the first one is actually not very new, it has been re-released with a new awesome remix by Mark Broom which closes the podcast, so I decided to play them both eheh!</p>
<p>As usual, if you like the podcast, the best way to say thanks is to leave a comment on the iTunes store (just look for Max Sanna and it will pop up immediately), or come say hi on Facebook too (This is the <a title="Max Sanna Sessions Facebook Group" href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?sid=63519c1dc46e8890480767f4e2b6d048&amp;gid=44358743723#/group.php?gid=34857678576&amp;ref=ts" target="_blank">dedicated group</a>)!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Hi fellas!

Here's the first episode of 2009, which will open the new year with some fresh sounds for your iPod!

It's kind of a special episode, I'd define it quite "esotic", as you'll notice while listening through it: many of the tracks feature long breakdowns filled with oriental flutes, sitars, strings and arabic chants, before throwing you back in dark and powerful beats.

Also, this episode is a tribute to one of the best italian DJs: Joe T Vannelli and his bomb tracks rocking Milan's club scene (my Italian listeners surely know his great night that went on for years, Supalova Club, the only event able to pack a club to capacity on a Thursday night). I played 3 of his latest tracks, and while the first one is actually not very new, it has been re-released with a new awesome remix by Mark Broom which closes the podcast, so I decided to play them both eheh!

As usual, if you like the podcast, the best way to say thanks is to leave a comment on the iTunes store (just look for Max Sanna and it will pop up immediately), or come say hi on Facebook too (This is the dedicated group)!

Here's the tracklist for January:

	Joe T Vannelli - Play With Vannelli feat. Csilla (Original Mix)
	Sidekick - Deepfear (Andrea Roma Remix)
	Kim Jofferey feat. Natalie Konan - Take Me There (Chris Kaeser Remix)

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s finally Christmas, and as I get ready to leave for some hols back in my home country (yes, Italy), I prepared 2 hours of banging electro and techno that won&#8217;t miss to entertain you while you have your Christmas Dinner with family and grandma and you unwrap your presents. Your granny will surely appreciate that!</p>
<p>As usual I&#8217;ll start with half a hour of warm-up to get in the party mood and to showcase some future mainstream tracks which I believe are worth being played (one of those is an awesome remix of me and Steve&#8217;s last single done by Mr. Velarde &amp; Luque, the producers behind Sundays At Heaven, a 2008 Ibiza anthem which everybody knows, deservedly so), but the techno bombs are all coming later so hold on to your chair, turn on the lasers and leave time to the smoke machine to warm up as well! <img src="http://www.podbean.com/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>This is the tracklist for this month:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sylvia Tosun &amp; Loverush UK - 5 Reasons (Arnold T Club Remix)</li>
<li>Max Sanna &amp; Steve Pitron - Bodyswerve (Velarde &amp; Luque Remix)</li>
<li>Phonjaxx Featuring Cozi - Sensual (Gold Ryan &amp; Tapesh Remix)</li>
<li>Sabrina Johnston - Peace (Kam Denny &amp; Paul Zala&#8217;s Denzal Park Remix)</li>
<li>Doman &amp; Gooding Feat. Dru &amp; Lincoln - Runnin&#8217; (Mark Knight &amp; Funkagenda&#8217;s Done Or Dusted Dub)</li>
<li>Golden Girls - Kinetic (Fontaine &amp; Blanco Remix)</li>
<li>Anton Pieete - Players (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Steve Lawler - Kalimba (Original Mix)</li>
<li>David Tort - Lost In Acid (Ausfahrt Remix)</li>
<li>Patrice Baumel &amp; Caitlin Devlin - 7 Days (Original Mix)</li>
<li>George Delkos - Off Time (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Jensen Blade &amp;  Monterey Beach Club - Bomberman (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Alex Kenji, Sara Galli &amp; Gianluca Luisi - Do What You Like (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Fabian Chui, Alex Blanco, Jon Woo - Footprints (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Patrice Baumel - Roar (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Chris Liebing - Turbular Bell (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Twinbeat - Twinbeat (Dandi &amp; Ugo Remix)</li>
<li>Joachim Garraud - Die Invasion feat. Farah Grays (Yoann Feynman Remix)</li>
<li>Alan Fitzpatrick - Mau Yin (Original Mix)</li>
<li>The Advent &amp; Industrialyzer - Code Noir (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Laidback Luke &amp; A-Trak - Shake It Down (Original Mix)</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#8217;s it, enjoy this month&#8217;s mix, leave me your feedback if you&#8217;d like to (always welcome) and I wish you all Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year full of great music! See you in 2009!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this month I&#8217;ve been really late with the release of my podcast, since I&#8217;ve been always away or busy, but at last I&#8217;ve done it. Let&#8217;s consider it a Halloween episode!</p>
<p>This time I decided to explore a bit more of prog and tech house, since I&#8217;ve been inspired by many good releases I found in the past 30 days.</p>
<p>Without dragging it any longer, just enjoy it and check out the playlist. If you like it, feel free to leave some feedback either here or on the iTunes Store (look for Max Sanna). That&#8217;d be really appreciated!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Hi all!

Unfortunately, this month I've been really late with the release of my podcast, since I've been always away or busy, but at last I've done it. Let's consider it a Halloween episode!

This time I decided to explore a bit more of prog and tech house, since I've been inspired by many good releases I found in the past 30 days.

Without dragging it any longer, just enjoy it and check out the playlist. If you like it, feel free to leave some feedback either here or on the iTunes Store (look for Max Sanna). That'd be really appreciated!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello everybody! I finally managed to put together this month&#8217;s podcast (a bit late, I know!), but I can tell you it was well worth the wait! I&#8217;m particularly pleased with this episode since i came back a few weeks ago from Ibiza (*who* didn&#8217;t go this year!?), got inspired and chosen some of the best and meanest tunes that made us shake our arses on those hot balearic nights, of course blended together with the rest of new cool stuff I found here and there.</p>
<p>As usual, the last two tracks of the podcast are my favourites: I decided to close this episode with a newly released single by Mauro Picotto, Contaminato. Man you gotta love that bass when it comes up! And Kobaya - Around The Bent is a real train when it kicks in!</p>
<p>So enjoy it, feel free to send me your feedback (always appreciated), or even better, leave me a feedback on the iTunes Store: just look for Max Sanna, and when you&#8217;ll find the podcast you&#8217;ll see a link that allows you to write a comment about it. I&#8217;ll be thankful for that!</p>
<p>This is the tracklist for this episode:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wheels &#038; Disco - Always On My Mind (Ben Macklin Remix)</li>
<li>Anastacia - I Can Feel You (Sanna &#038; Pitron Rmx)</li>
<li>The Shapeshifters - Lola&#8217;s Theme (2008 Re-Edit)</li>
<li>Tim Royko &#038; Keemo - Beautiful Lie feat. Cosmo Klein (Joachim Garraud Remix)</li>
<li>Denis The Menace &#038; Big World pre. Phillip Van Het Veld - Show Me A Reason (Terrace Mix)</li>

<p>Here it is, the August episode is finally out, just in time before I leave for holidays in Ibiza! This month’s episode is really “electric”, and I indulged myself into techno tracks I really love towards the end. As some of you already noticed I always keep a dark treat for the end of the episode, and this time is a dancefloor smasher which has been a heartquake in all the hard clubs across Europe this summer, a mash-up of Daniele Papini’s Church of Nonsense together with the lovely vocals of Mauro Picotto’s classic: Lizard.

<li>Maurizio Gubellini - Leave Me Alone feat. Melanie (Original M.G. Club Mix)</li>
<li>Weekend Lovers feat. Amanda Wilson - Saturday (Sex On Monday Rmx)</li>
<li>ATFC - Praise To The JBs (Original Mix)</li>
<li>Ben DJ Feat. Sushy - Me &#038; Myself (Wolfgang Gartner Club Mix)</li>
<li>Kraak &#038; Smaak - Plastic People (Prok &#038; Fitch Vocal Mix)</li>
<li>Lonyo - Go Down (Alox P &#038; Suji Mason Mix)</li>

<li>Minilogue - Jamaica (Dubfire Remix)</li>
