            <title>Vera Cruz, 1914</title>
            <description>In 1914, as tensions between Mexico and the United States heightened, the United States occupied Vera Cruz, Mexico.  President Wilson wished to avoid open war, but his generals and the Secretary of War wanted to be prepared for any contingency—even a total invasion of Mexico. Thirty-four year old Captain Douglas MacArthur was tapped to play a key role in their preparations for war. Sent to Vera Cruz on an intelligence gathering mission, MacArthur trekked deep into enemy territory in search of missing locomotives that the army could use in a potential invasion.  Despite being attacked several times by armed men, he accomplished his mission – garnering his first nomination for the Medal of Honor. This month’s podcast will tell the story of MacArthur’s Vera Cruz mission – an event he later referred to as “a wild night under the Southern Cross.” </description>

            <title>6th VA Infantry</title>
            <description>Douglas MacArthur came from a distinguished military family.  His father Arthur, a Medal of Honor recipient, was a veteran of both the Civil War and Spanish-American War.  Several of MacArthur’s mother’s brothers also served in uniform. Three of them attended Virginia Military Institute, and of these, two served in the 6th Virginia Infantry during the Civil War. The 6th Virginia fought in nearly every major engagement in the Virginia theater – including the controversial Battle of the Crater in July 1964 at Petersburg.  This month’s podcast will examine the 6th Virginia and the military service of MacArthur’s maternal uncles – revealing an often overlooked chapter of General Douglas MacArthur’s military ancestry.</description>

            <title>POW’s:  The Nurses of Bataan and Corregidor</title>
            <description>For many young women in 1940, being an Army or Navy nurse meant a life of adventure and independence – a thrilling alternative to a normal, routine life.  Those stationed in the Philippines looked forward to a life of luxury – and it was even said that no nurse’s wardrobe was complete without an evening gown and a swimsuit.  All of this changed abruptly on December 7, 1941.  Thrust into a warzone, these nurses found themselves struggling to save lives in the jungles of Bataan and in the tunnels of Corregidor.  Within a year, they would all be prisoners of the Japanese Army.  This month’s podcast provides a brief overview of these women’s military service.</description>

            <title>MacArthur&apos;s Medal of Honor</title>
            <description>The Medal of Honor is the highest honor that any member of the armed forces can receive.  The award is granted to a person who distinguishes “himself by gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of…life, above and beyond the call of duty, in action involving actual combat with the enemy.”  General Douglas MacArthur received the Medal of Honor on April 1, 1942.  Prior to this, MacArthur had displayed courageous actions in Vera Cruz, Mexico and in France during World War I which had almost resulted in him receiving the Medal of Honor.  This podcast will explore these early events as well as explain the circumstances surrounding the award of the medal in1942.</description>

            <title>The 26th Cavalry Regiment and the Final U.S. Cavalry Charge</title>
            <description>Many people believe that with World War I, the horse became a relic of the past.  This belief is understandable.  More than any other war; the deadly stalemate of World War I proved that muscle and sinew could not resist the crushing force of modern mechanized war or chemical weapons.  Nevertheless, while the horse faded from the battlefields of Western Europe, it did not become completely obsolete.  The final charge of the U.S. Army Cavalry would take place in the Philippines during World War II.  This historic charge pitted the exhausted 26th Cavalry Regiment against a vastly superior enemy force.  This podcast will examine final charge – an event many historians have called a fitting tribute to the legacy of the U.S. Army Cavalry.</description>

            <title>Billy Mitchell and MacArthur</title>
            <description>In 1925, the court martial of Billy Mitchell captured national attention.  The trial was so sensational that it would go on to inspire numerous books and even a movie starring Gary Cooper.  At the center of the controversy was Billy Mitchell, a man who is today recognized as the father of the United States Air Force.  An advocate of air power at a time when few could envision aircraft ever having a major impact on the battlefield, Mitchell would be a martyr for this cause.  Douglas MacArthur was a friend of Mitchell, but was also a member of the jury trying Mitchell.  This month’s podcast will discuss the friendship between the two men and the events surrounding the court martial.</description>

            <title>MacArthur and JFK</title>
            <description>Today, many people are amazed to learn that General MacArthur and President Kennedy admired each other.  Given MacArthur’s track record with Democrats and the generational gap between the two men, this is not surprising.  Despite their differences however, Kennedy and MacArthur actually had a great deal in common – both were patrician and charismatic, both had been raised in an environment that valued drive, success, and destiny, and both had demonstrated courage in war.  More than any other president, Kennedy understood MacArthur – and MacArthur reciprocated – respecting Kennedy far more than his predecessors.  This month’s podcast explores the relationship between the two men.</description>

            <title>&quot;I Shall Return&quot; - The Pledge</title>
            <description>Many people are familiar with General Douglas MacArthur’s famous “I shall return” pledge.  The pledge was made after the General’s successful escape from the Philippines during World War II, and it soon became the cornerstone of his strategy in the Pacific Theatre as well as a rallying cry for the guerilla movement in the Philippines.  Although the pledge is very famous, few people understand how difficult it was to make the promise a reality.  This month’s podcast takes a look at the battles – both military and bureaucratic – that MacArthur fought to honor his promise.</description>

            <title>&quot;A Striking Ornament&quot; - The MacArthur Memorial Building</title>
            <description>Many visitors are curious about the building that houses General Douglas MacArthur’s tomb and museum.  Known today as the MacArthur Memorial, the building was once the City of Norfolk’s City Hall and Courthouse.  Constructed in 1850, the building has played a central role in many local and national dramas over the years.  This month’s podcast delves into the history of the building - from the initial wishes of Norfolk’s citizens to create “a striking ornament” to represent the city, to the building’s eventual role as the MacArthur Memorial.</description>

            <title>Wainwright &amp; MacArthur</title>
            <description>The careers of General Douglas MacArthur and General Jonathan Wainwright are indelibly intertwined with one of the darkest moments in American military history – the fall of the Philippines at the beginning of World War II.  Even though both men received the Medal of Honor for their handling of the doomed situation in the Philippines, Bataan and Corregidor would haunt them for the rest of their lives.  This month’s podcast highlights both men against the backdrop of Bataan and Corregidor.</description>

            <title>Investigating MacArthur&apos;s Decorations</title>
            <description>During his 52 year military career, General Douglas MacArthur received more than 100 decorations – including the Medal of Honor – making him one of the most highly decorated officers in U.S. military history.  Many of these decorations are on display in the MacArthur Memorial today, and visitors to the Memorial are often curious about the circumstances behind some of these awards.  This podcast will provide background information on MacArthur’s three Distinguished Service Crosses, seven Silver Stars, Distinguished Flying Cross, Air Medal, and two Purple Hearts.</description>

            <title>Superheroes, the Comics, and World War II</title>
            <description>As part of the material culture of the 1940s, comic books can provide World War II historians with information about everyday people and the times they lived in.  Superman, Captain America, and other superheroes didn’t really fight in World War II, but the comics did influence public perceptions of the war and provide an outlet for national aspirations and fears.  They created a black and white world of heroes and villains, whose adventures were acted out against the backdrop of a very real war and its very real players.  As we will see, even General Douglas MacArthur was featured in the comics!</description>

            <title>The General&apos;s Mother</title>
            <description>Mary “Pinky” Hardy MacArthur was a formidable woman.  Her son General Douglas MacArthur regarded her as one of the dominating factors of his life.  As Army Chief of Staff in the 1930’s, he remarked that she had raised his father to a Lieutenant General’s three stars, and he attributed his own greater success to the fact that she had a much earlier start with him.  This month’s podcast provides a brief overview of the life of “Pinky” and her relationship with her son.</description>

            <title>Truman Fires MacArthur</title>
            <description>On April 11, 1951, General MacArthur was relieved of his command by President Truman, ending his 52 year military career.  Both men had been increasingly at odds with each other since August 1945 - almost from the day Truman chose MacArthur to accept the Japanese surrender and oversee the occupation.  It was during the Korean War however that their divergent views on U.S. foreign policy and Communist China brought them into open conflict.  This month&apos;s podcast reviews the final events that led to MacArthur&apos;s relief.</description>

            <title>Escape From Corregidor</title>
            <description>In March 1942, General MacArthur, his wife Jean, his son Arthur, and select members of his staff quietly boarded PT 41 in the Philippines.  They were embarking on a dangerous escape attempt.  Against all odds, the escape was successful, and from the safety of Australia MacArthur would utter the famous promise: “I shall return.”  For the next two and a half years however, those left behind on Bataan and Corregidor knew only captivity, horror, and death.  This month’s podcast examines the escape and MacArthur’s thoughts on leaving.</description>

He had been sent to meet with General MacArthur and to conduct an investigation into irregularities in the courts martial of thirty nine black soldiers.

            <description>Today, few people are aware of General Douglas MacArthur’s contributions to football. As a player, a devoted fan, and an advocate of the sport, MacArthur’s interest in football was both personal and professional. A competitor at heart, he just loved the game. As a leader, he recognized the practical benefit of football on leadership and citizenship. Summing up his feelings about football, MacArthur once explained: “In war and peace, I have found football men to be my greatest reliance.”</description>

            <description>On December 7, 1941, the Empire of Japan launched a surprise attack against the United States of America at Pearl Harbor. While December 7th is a date etched in the minds of many Americans, few are aware that a similar attack on American forces took place in the Philippines on December 8, 1941. At the time, General MacArthur was commander of US forces in the Philippines. This month we are going to examine MacArthur’s response to the attacks – something that has bewildered scholars for decades.</description>

            <description>Decades before Douglas MacArthur became a household name during World War II and the Korean War, his father Arthur MacArthur, Jr. achieved almost equal military fame during the Civil War. Although he was initially ridiculed by the men of his command at the beginning of his military career in 1862, by the time the Civil War ended he was a recognized war hero and a 20 year old Colonel, affectionately known as the “Boy Colonel.” Arthur MacArthur’s Civil War service would have a major impact on his son Douglas, who was driven throughout his own career to emulate if not surpass his father’s success.</description>

            <title>MacArthur and the 5000 to 1 Gamble</title>
            <description>The amphibious invasion at Inchon in September of 1950 was General MacArthur’s greatest battlefield triumph.  It completely surprised the North Korean forces and altered the momentum of the Korean War.  Although the invasion was ultimately successful, in the beginning there was little support for it and many were convinced that Inchon would be a disaster.  This month, we take a look at how MacArthur ultimately packaged and sold the idea of landing at Inchon to its critics.</description>

            <title>MacArthur and the Atomic Bomb</title>
            <description>On the 65th anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, we take a look at MacArthur and the atomic bomb – how and when he found out about the bomb, what he knew about the potential targets, and how he reacted to its use on both cities.  As with many things about MacArthur, his thoughts on the bomb were complex.</description>

            <title>MacArthur and the Bonus March</title>
            <description>This month, we take a look at the Bonus March of 1932 and MacArthur’s actions and decision making during this controversial event.  In popular culture, MacArthur has played the role of villain of the Bonus March – he did after all help to evict homeless and jobless World War I veterans from Washington, D.C. where they had been pressing Congress for benefits.  But is there more to the story?</description>
