		<itunes:summary>When I first went to the Soviet Union (in all my ignorance), I was amazed that everyone in Moscow lived in what I called &#8220;housing projects.&#8221; The Russians called them &#8220;houses&#8221; (doma), but they weren&#8217;t houses as I understood them at all. They were huge, multi-story, cookie-cutter apartment blocks, one standing right next to the other for miles. &#8220;Why?&#8221; I asked myself.
Kimberly Zarecor&#8216;s wonderful Manufacturing a Socialist Modernity: Housing in Czechoslovakia, 1945-1960 (Pittsburgh UP, 2011) goes a long way in providing an answer, and it&#8217;s a surprising one. As she shows, socialism and architectural modernism were tightly linked even before the Second World War. This was true in the Soviet Union, of course, but it was also true throughout much of Europe&#8211;especially in Czechoslovakia. The avante guard of Czech architects were enthralled with modernism, just as they were (with some exceptions) enthralled with the promise of communism. They believed modernism provided a template for a truly socialist architecture, particularly in the sphere of housing. Once the communists came to power after the war, the Czech architects were given the opportunity to realize the dream of building that truly socialist built environment. The result was the &#8220;panel house&#8221;: pre-fab apartment blocks built in factories, transported to sites, and then assembled. They were strikingly modern in terms of design, construction techniques and materials. Over time, the panel-house vision was compromised: by Socialist Realism, by economic contraints, by  corruption and politics. But if you travel to the Czech Republic today, you can still see excellent examples of modernist panel houses in more or less pure form. Let Kimberly Zarecor be you guide.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in East Asian Studies] Taylor Atkins&#8216; recent book is both an important contribution to East Asian Studies and an absolute delight to read. Primitive Selves: Koreana in the Japanese Colonial Gaze, 1910-1945 (University of California Press, 2010) opens with a movie theater commercial in 2004 and closes with a metaphorical decapitation. In the intervening chapters Atkins develops a series of sophisticated and masterfully defended arguments about the ways that colonial Japan was transformed by its engagement with Korean society and culture. Integrating critical literature on empire and colonialism, Japanese and Korean cultural history, and epistemological studies of loss and of observation, Primitive Selves is a model of careful, elegant, and responsible historical work lightened by a wonderful sense of humor. It was my sincere pleasure both to read the book, and to talk with Atkins about it.
As Atkins mentions in the course of his book and our conversation, all of the proceeds of the book are donated to the Tahirih Justice Center, which can be found here.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in Native American Studies] The birth of the American republic produced immense and existential challenges to Native people in proximity to the fledgling nation. Perhaps none faced a greater predicament than the Six Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy (popularly known as the Iroquois). Divided by the U.S.-English conflict, their landbase ransacked by American soldiers and speculators, their once considerable political power reduced, and their culture threatened by an influx of zealous missionaries &#8212; such is what historian Matthew Dennis in his powerful new book, Seneca Possessed: Indians, Witchcraft, and Power in the Early American Republic (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), has termed &#8220;the colonial crucible.&#8221;
Yet, Dennis persuades us, &#8220;the Seneca story is not mere prologue.&#8221; One of the Six Nations residing in what became western New York State, the Seneca adapted to the invasion of their homeland, building upon elements of their culture and selectively embracing change to survive the economic and political transformations of the post-Revolutionary period. The revelations of the Seneca prophet Handsome Lake, blended with elements of Christianity, yielded a new and powerful religion that rejected white degradation. But in the process, the prophet challenged the powerful position of women in Seneca society, as accusations of witchcraft &#8211; newly focused on women &#8211; led to violence.
As western New York continues its decades long process of deindustrialization, losing population with every closed down factory, the Seneca Nation remains, vibrant as ever. Matthew Dennis&#8217; fascinating new book helps us see just how they did.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Over 2.5 million Germans died as a result of World War I, or about 4% of the German population at the time. Somewhere between 7 and 9 million Germans died as a result of World War II, or between 8% to 11% of the German population at the time.* It&#8217;s hardly any wonder, then, that in the first half of the twentieth century the Germans were preoccupied with death and how to deal with it&#8211;it was all around them.
Monica Black&#8216;s impressive Death in Berlin: From Weimar to Divided Germany (Cambridge University Press, 2011) explains how they did it. She focuses on remembrances of various sorts (funerals, monuments, eulogies, etc.) and the ways in which they were shaped by German tradition, transient ideology, and exigency. As Monica demonstrates, Germans themselves changed &#8220;German Way of Death&#8221; radically over this short period as they attempted to deal with a whole variety of competing pressures, values and interests. This is a fascinating book as it shows how the dead, though gone, are really (and particularly in the German case) still with us.
*To put German losses in perspective, 117,000 Americans died in World War I (.13% of the population) and 418,000 Americans died in World War II (.37% of the population).</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>I used to hike in and around Yosemite National Park. To me (and I imagine thousands of other visitors), Yosemite was the embodiment of &#8220;nature,&#8221; something grand, pristine, and, well &#8220;natural.&#8221; Of course there is a sense in which that is true: Yosemite was not made by the hand of man.
But in another sense that understanding is false, as Jen Huntley explains in The Making of Yosemite: James Mason Hutchings and the Origins of America&#8217;s Most Popular National Park (UP of Kansas, 2011). Yosemite the Place may be &#8220;natural,&#8221; but Yosemite the Park is not. It was made by a set of people with a variety of interests, some familiar to us (e.g., making money) and others not (e.g., purifying the nation). Suffice it to say that the makers of Yosemite the Park were not exactly &#8220;environmentalists&#8221; as we understand them. They were people of their own time, and with that time&#8217;s ideas and values. Jen does a terrific job of exploring them (and the fascinating James Hutchings in particular), what they thought, what they wanted to do, and what they did to create Yosemite.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>When I was an undergraduate, I took a class called &#8220;The Enlightenment&#8221; in which we read all the thinkers of, well, &#8220;The Enlightenment.&#8221; I came to understand that they were the &#8220;good guys&#8221; of Western history, at least for most folks. We also read, as a kind of coda, a bit about the &#8220;Counter-Enlightenment,&#8221; of which you may never have heard. The writers of the Counter-Enlightenment were, I learned, the &#8220;bad guys&#8221; of Western history, for they (apparently) didn&#8217;t like reason, truth, progress and all that.
First among the black-hats was Joseph de Maistre. He believed the French Revolution was &#8220;satanic,&#8221; as were the ideas behind it. Or so I thought until I read Carolina Armenteros&#8216; excellent book The French Idea of History: Joseph de Maistre and his Heirs, 1794-1854 (Cornell University Press, 2011). Turns out de Maistre was a good deal more subtle and thoughtful than the &#8220;received view&#8221; of him suggests, and Carolina does a marvelous job of making plain how and why. In this interview, Carolina explains not only the complexity of his thought, but also that he wasn&#8217;t really French, let alone a black-hat wearing reactionary.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Historians are not supposed to make stuff up. If it happened, and can be proved to have happened, then it&#8217;s in; if it didn&#8217;t, or can&#8217;t be documented, then it&#8217;s out. This way of going about writing history is fine as far as it goes. It does, however, have a significant drawback: it limits the historian&#8217;s ability to tell the truth&#8211;not the truth of &#8220;facts,&#8221; but the truth of stories. Facts are facts; stories have meaning. Most history books are full of facts; yet many lack stories, and necessarily so. As a practicing historian, I can tell you this situation is very frustrating. We know that sometimes the facts are just not enough, but there is nothing we can do about it within the confines of our discipline.
There are historians&#8211;if that&#8217;s what they are&#8211;who just can&#8217;t stand these restrictions. They want to tell historical stories, and they do. They write &#8220;historical fiction&#8221; and, as a rule, they get very little respect in the literary or academic worlds. I doubt most of them are bothered. Why should they be? Historical fiction is remarkably popular: thousands of titles appear each year and those titles are read by millions of readers. Who cares if literary journals and professional historians poo-poo historical fiction? People love it.
Once in a great while, however, a book comes along whose truth is so powerful that even the literary critics and professors take notice. Francis Spufford&#8217;s Red Plenty: Industry! Progress! Abundance! Inside the Fifties Soviet Dream (Greywolf Press, 2012) is such a book. It contains more &#8220;truth&#8221; about the Soviet project than an entire library of &#8220;serious&#8221; novels and dry-as-dust histories. If I had to recommend one book on the Soviet Union to someone who wanted to understand it, Red Plenty would be it. Read it.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in Sports] Howard Cosell was fond of saying that American television in the 1970s was dominated by three C’s, representing each of the broadcast networks: revered CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite, NBC’s late-night talk show host Johnny Carson, and Cosell himself, the marquee sports announcer for the ABC network.  Cosell was known for an inflated sense of self-importance, but in this claim he was accurate.  From his interviews of Muhammad Ali on Wide World of Sports in the Sixties, through his 13-year tenure in the broadcast booth of Monday Night Football, Cosell came to be the most prominent personality in sports television and one of the most recognizable figures—certainly, the most recognized voice—in all of American popular culture.
Throughout his career, Cosell aspired to be more like the trusted journalist Cronkite than the entertainer Carson.  And one of the main points of historian John Bloom’s biography, There You Have It: The Life, Legacy, and Legend of Howard Cosell (University of Massachusetts Press, 2010), is that Cosell was an innovative, probing, and fearless reporter.  Cosell defended Ali when the boxer was stripped of his heavyweight title.  He spoke on behalf of Tommie Smith and John Carlos when they were sent home after their protest at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.  And he denounced boxing and refused to work in the sport again, after announcing the horribly one-sided Holmes-Cobb championship fight in 1982.
At the same time, Cosell recognized that sports was entertainment.  He played his role for laughs in the Woody Allen film Bananas and on the made-for-TV “athletic competitions” of lesser actors and actresses.  But as his fame peaked, Cosell’s stated opinion of sports turned sharply and dismissively critical.  The broadcaster always felt himself an outsider in the world of sports, a characteristic that Bloom attributes to Cosell’s Jewish background.  And as a trained attorney, Cosell felt himself intellectually superior to the jocks and shills, as he called them.  He gained wealth and fame through sports, but he came to see himself as bigger than sports.  In that sense, Cosell can be seen not only as a legendary figure, but also as a tragic one.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in Science, Technology, and Society] Chewing on raw turnips and sand, keeping both feet in a tub of cold water, reading with just one eye open (to give the other a chance to rest) and sleeping only every other night: no, I am not describing the typical life of a pre-tenure professor trying to get her book finished. Instead, these are just some of the sacrifices that compilers made in order to produce some of the most massive reference works in early modernity. In a work of extraordinary depth that ranges from antiquity through the eighteenth century (with stops in China and the modern world of the internet along the way), Ann Blair guides readers through the landscape of information management of early modern Europe. Too Much To Know: Managing Scholarly Information before the Modern Age (Yale University Press, 2010) is many things at one: a richly textured history of early modern dictionaries and other reference works; an exploration of the emergence of the textual technologies like indexes that aided navigation through early modern texts; and a collection of stories about the lengths to which early modern authors would go to collect and manage information before the era of searchable word processing documents. Too Much To Know is a garden of paper, ready for harvesting by readers interested in a wide range of fields from book history to information technology to religious studies.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in Science, Technology and Society] Though Einstein, Planck, and Pauli have become household names in the history of science, the work of Arnold Sommerfeld has yet to reach the same level of wide recognition outside the field of theoretical physics and its history. In Crafting the Quantum: Arnold Sommerfeld and the Practice of Theory, 1890-1926(MIT Press, 2010), Suman Seth not only makes a compelling case for the centrality of Sommerfeld as a theoretician and teacher of physics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but also uses the Sommerfeld School to speak to broad issues that are central to the way we understand science and its history. With humor, sensitivity, and a wide-ranging fluency in the conceptual and methodological studies of science, Seth translates the history and fabric of theoretical physics into a rich account of the practice and pedagogy of physical science, revising what we think we know about the roles of discipline, revolution, and ski trips in the history of physics. It is both an archaeology of the relationship between theory and experiment in modern history, and a beautifully wrought tale of the transformation of one of modern science&#8217;s most influential teachers and practitioners of the &#8220;physics of problems.&#8221;</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in Sports] “I’m sure if it wasn’t for Joe Louis,” acknowledged Jackie Robinson, “the color line in baseball would not have been broken for another ten years.” To Muhammad Ali, Joe Louis was an inspiration and an idol. “I just give lip service to being the greatest,” said Ali in 1981, after Louis’ death. “He was the greatest.”
Yet, while Jackie Robinson is now one of the most revered athletes in American history and Ali remains a cultural icon, the man who paved the way for both is lesser known today, more a distant folk hero than a historical figure whose accomplishments are understood and respected.  Unlike Robinson, Louis was not the pioneering black athlete in his sport, and unlike Ali, he did not translate his success in the ring into a platform for larger media fame and political statements.  Nevertheless, as Randy Roberts shows in his acclaimed biography Joe Louis: Hard Times Man (Yale University Press, new in paperback in February 2012), the heavyweight champion was an athlete without peer in his sport, one of the most talked-about celebrities of the day, and a man who did effect change, in some positive way, in white Americans’ perceptions of black athletes.  He was a symbolic figure of the Thirties and Forties and, as Randy argues, an essential character for understanding the history of that era.
A distinguished professor of history at Purdue University, award-winning teacher, and author of books on Jack Dempsey, Jack Johnson, Charles Lindbergh, and John Wayne, Randy brings to the book an expert understanding of sports and celebrity in American history and a lively, arresting style.  With attention to colorful detail and to the larger context of early 20th-century American history, he describes Joe Louis as a man of his times—and as a giant of the age.  This is a story that certainly deserves retelling.

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in Military History] This week’s podcast is an interview with David Stahel. I will be talking to him about his 2009 work, Operation Barbarossa and Germany’s Defeat in the East (Cambridge University Press). One of our previous guests, Matthias Strohn, recommended the book, and I am glad he did. Stahel’s book is an important contribution to our understanding of German planning for and execution of Operation Barbarossa. Stahel highlights the many flaws and paradoxes intrinsic to German thinking about war in the East, not least of which was the deception perpetrated by Halder, who masked the centrality of the drive on Moscow to his own plans in order to avoid confrontation with Hitler. By late August 1941, Stahel argues, the German failure decisively to defeat the Soviet regime (even while winning significant victories at places like Minsk and Smolensk) spelled doom for the Wehrmacht.
Nor is Stahel resting on his laurels. By the time I conducted the interview, his second work had just hit the shelves. In Kiev 1941: Hitler’s Battle for Supremacy in the East (Cambridge University Press, 2011), Stahel analyzes in detail the critical battle on the southern front. After talking with Stahel late last year, that one is on my reading list as well. And Typhoon is on its way after that.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>My favorite book as a teenager (and in fact the only book I ever read as a teenager) was All Quiet on the Western Front. I liked it mostly for the vivid scenes of trench warfare. Teenage boys love that stuff (or at least I did). But even then I recognized that it was essentially an anti-war book. It was hard to miss: the protagonist, Paul, has a pretty nasty time of it in the trenches, and he gets killed at the end. In the years that followed I somehow got the impression that All Quiet was essentially the first real anti-war book. Before WWI, I thought, everyone who wrote about war glorified it.
As Cynthia Wachtell shows in War No More: The Antiwar Impulse in American Literature, 1861-1914 (Louisiana State University Press, 2010), I was just dead wrong about this. In American letters anti-war sentiment abounded. Many of the leading lights of American lit wrote anti-war tracts, and some of them were remarkably &#8220;modern&#8221; (those by Ambrose Bierce are particularly astonishing, and I highly recommend them). Wachtell does a masterful job of uncovering many of these neglected works, putting them in historical context, and establishing that there was, in fact, an American anti-war tradition. This is an excellent, eye-opening book.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>People who care about other places (and that&#8217;s not everyone) have always thought of Russia as a strange place. It doesn&#8217;t seem to &#8220;fit.&#8221; A good part of Russia is in Europe, but it&#8217;s not exactly &#8220;European.&#8221; Russia has natural resources galore, but it&#8217;s surprisingly poor. Russians have written a lot of great literature, but for most of Russian history most Russians have been illiterate. Russia has produced some great scientists, but it has also produced some catastrophically bad ones (see &#8220;Trofim Lysenko&#8221; for more). 
The most consistent of the Russian inconsistencies has to do, however, with politics. Russia has had a lot of very &#8220;enlightened&#8221; rulers. Peter, Catherine, Alexander (two of them), and, of course, Lenin and co. These folks took the best theories the West had to offer and put them into practice, or at least tried to. The results, however, were usually disastrous, and never so much so as in the case of the Bolsheviks. In the name of progress, they arguably created the most despotic state in history. 
Interestingly, many of the people who cared about other places&#8211;especially Western Leftists&#8211;didn&#8217;t notice this contradiction between theory and practice. Why? The ordinary answer (and, I should add, a quite convincing one) is that they loved the theory, so they were willing to overlook the practice. But, as Michael David-Fox shows in his highly original Showcasing the Great Experiment: Cultural Diplomacy and Western Visitors to the Soviet Union, 1921-1941 (Oxford University Press, 2011), that was not the only reason the Western Leftists got it wrong. Another reason, and one David-Fox explores in great detail using a remarkable range of archival sources, is that the Soviets built a PR machine to send the right message to the fellow-travelers. They wined them, dined them, and showed them the many (and carefully selected) victories of socialist labor. 

Which brings us to the most fascinating part of David-Fox&#8217;s book. The fact of the matter is that the Soviets, no matter how hard they tried, could not hide what came to be known among cynical Russians as &#8220;Soviet reality.&#8221; The Soviet Union in the 1920 and 1930s was a mess of titanic proportions. The Bolshevik elite knew it (they&#8217;d been to the West and often lived there), and so did the fellow-travellers. The Western visitors in David-Fox&#8217;s book saw &#8220;Soviet reality,&#8221; and sometimes they even wrote, disappointedly, about it while they were in the USSR. But when they got home, all this &#8220;Soviet reality&#8221; was forgotten, replaced by an image of a utopia in the making. 
It makes one wonder if the Soviets needed to worry about their image abroad at all, for that image was firmly evolved in the minds of Western Leftists before they ever arrived in the USSR and carried away when they left it. What happened in between arrival and departure didn&#8217;t seem to matter much.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>When I was a kid I loved movies about Nazis who had escaped justice after the war. There was &#8220;The Marathon Man&#8221; (&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m not going into that cavity. That nerve&#8217;s already dying.&#8221;). There was &#8220;The Boys from Brazil&#8221; (&#8220;The right Hitler for the right future! A Hitler tailor-made for the 1980s, 90s, 2000!&#8221;)  And there was &#8220;The ODESSA File&#8221; (&#8220;Germany believes she doesn&#8217;t need us now&#8230;but one day she&#8217;ll know that she does!&#8221;). &#8220;The ODESSA File&#8221; was my favorite because it explained what really happened, how the evil Nazis formed a super-secret group (Organisation der Ehemaligen SS-Angehörigen) to get themselves out of Germany so they could one day return to power.
The trouble is that&#8217;s not what happened at all. In fact, there was no ODESSA. In 1947, someone tricked Nazi-hunter Simon Weisenthal into believing &#8220;ODESSA&#8221; existed (he was quite willing to be tricked). Then Fredrick Forsyth amplified the myth in his book &#8220;The ODESSA File&#8221; (1972). Then Hollywood gave the story the full Hollywood treatment in movie &#8220;The ODESSA File&#8221; (1974). Hollywood tricked me into believing it existed (I was quite willing to be tricked).
If you want to know the truth about how the Nazis got away, read Gerald Steinacher remarkably thorough Nazis on the Run: How Hitler&#8217;s Henchmen Fled Justice (Oxford University Press, 2011). He shows that there was a sort of conspiracy to get the Nazis out, it just wasn&#8217;t very conspiratorial. Even before the war the Nazis (and the SS particularly) were thinking about how to get away from the crumbling Reich. They talked to one an other, made contacts abroad, and traded tips. After some experimenting with various routes, they determined one was far and away most effective: through Austria, into Italy, and then overseas. They had a lot of help. Some of it was for hire, for example in South Tyrol where a kind of Nazi-smuggling industry arose. Some was gratis, for example that offered by a German bishop in Rome. Add some bungling by the International Red Cross, some skullduggery by the OSS, some complicity by foreign powers (e.g., Argentina) seeking German &#8220;experts,&#8221; and&#8211;just like that&#8211;the &#8220;Ratlines&#8221; were clear and known to anyone paying attention. Steinacher shows that no ODESSA-like organization was necessary for the Nazis to escape. All they had to do was follow the well-trodden, clearly marked path that lead away from justice in Europe and into safety abroad. That&#8217;s more disturbing than ODESSA.

		<itunes:summary>The founding fathers&#8211;and mothers, sons and daughters&#8211;were British. Sort of. It&#8217;s true that they were subjects of the British crown, and that they looked, talked, acted and had the tastes of folks in London. But they were always different. Though they carried with them a sort of &#8220;British cultural package,&#8221; what they changed that cultural package, sometimes intentionally and sometimes accidentally. To draw an  evolutionary analogy, they &#8220;speciated,&#8221; that is, evolved into something new. But just what it was they did not know, not before the Revolution and for a long time after it.
In her enlightening Unbecoming British: How Revolutionary America Became a Postcolonial Nation (Oxford UP, 2011), Kariann Akemi Yokota tells us how early &#8220;Americans&#8221; dealt with the problem of &#8220;American&#8221; identity. They were nothing if not conflicted: they recognized that British culture was much more sophisticated than their own, but they also sought to find virtue in American rudeness. One of the most interesting things about Kariann&#8217;s book is how she uses a variety of unusual sources to study this cultural anxiety&#8211;porcelain, maps, paintings, furniture, architecture, cloth, clothes, and other artifacts of &#8220;material culture.&#8221; Her analysis made me look at the &#8220;material culture&#8221; in my own house differently (&#8220;What in the world does a Dustbuster say about being an Amerian?&#8221;). Kariann&#8217;s book will make you think differently about how Americans became Americans.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>You&#8217;ve got to be pretty creative to get anything like &#8220;holy war&#8221; out of the New Testament, what with all that trespass-forgiving, cheek-turning, and neighbor-loving. By all appearances Jesus didn&#8217;t want his followers to fight for their faith, but rather to die for it as he had. And during the first three centuries of Christianity&#8211;in the time of the Roman persecution&#8211;that&#8217;s just what they did. &#8220;To die in Christ is to live,&#8221; wrote the Apostle Paul. And it seems a lot of early Christians believed him for they sought martyrdom. Jesus passively gave his life; and they passively gave theirs. What could be more fitting?
All this passivity makes the Crusades seem very strange indeed. If Christ&#8217;s message was one of peace, what in the world were Christians doing taking up arms in the his name? In his excellent Armies of Heaven: The First Crusade and the Quest for Apocalypse (Basic Books, 2011),  Jay Rubenstein explains that the reason they did so had everything to do with the conviction that the world was going to presently end. The Crusaders fervently believed that the closing chapter in temporal history upon them and that they had a role in bringing it to the right conclusion. They didn&#8217;t know exactly what that role was, but there were good hints in ancient scripture and contemporary signs. Everyone agreed that, whatever part the Crusaders were to play, it involved liberating Jerusalem from the infidels. So off they went. Since they were on a holy mission&#8211;in fact the last holy mission before Christ&#8217;s return&#8211;the ordinary rules did not apply. The Crusaders forced Jews to convert or else die (many were murdered). They killed Muslims indescriminately. They made sport of desecrating the bodies of their victems. They even roasted some on spits and ate them. That&#8217;s right: they roasted and ate them. It was like something out of the Book of Revelations. Which made sense, because the Crusaders believed they were in the Book of Revelations.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>If you&#8217;re a native-born American, you&#8217;re probably familiar with Aunt Jemima (pancake syrup), Uncle Ben (precooked rice), and Rastus (oatmeal)&#8211;commercial icons all. They were co-oped in whole or part from stock characters in American minstrel shows, largely because they suggested to white consumers a comforting though bygone hospitality. Aunt Jemima said &#8220;You might not have a loving mammy to do your home cookin&#8217;, but you can eat as if you did.&#8221;
I grew up with Aunt Jemima and loved her syrup dearly, so I knew this.  But I did not know that a similar tradition of racist commercial icons existed in Imperial Germany. I do now, thanks to David Ciarlo&#8216;s insightful Advertising Empire: Race and Visual Culture in Imperial Germany (Harvard UP, 2011). The Germans had been using images such as the &#8220;tobacco moor&#8221; to stamp their exotic trade goods since the eighteenth century. But it was only in the 1890s that they began to use the &#8220;moor&#8221; in mass advertising per se. It was only then, too, that they began to carve out an empire full of &#8220;moors&#8221; in southwest Africa. David skillfully connects the two phenomenon, showing that the latter tangibly altered the character of the former. The image of Africans in ads went from one that emphasized the exotic to one that stressed the exotic under German domination. Depictions that were almost entirely fanciful became much more concrete. Africans came to represent racial Untermenchen in the service of their German overlords. It was an appealing picture, and one the Germans would&#8211;unfortunately&#8211;not soon forget.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Europeans like to say that &#8220;America&#8221; (aka the &#8220;United States&#8221;) is not a nation. They are right and wrong. It&#8217;s true that Americans come from all over the place, unlike, say, Germans.  Just ask an American where she comes from. She&#8217;s likely to reply that she comes from Ireland, Africa, Korea or Germany even if she has never set foot in Ireland, Africa, Korea or Germany. We Americans self-identify as a &#8220;nation of immigrants,&#8221; not really a &#8220;nation&#8221; per se.
But if  Colin Woodward is right there are in fact nations in America, or rather North America.  In his terrific new book  American Nations: A History of Eleven Rival Regional Cultures of North America (Viking, 2011) he identifies a bunch of them: First Nation, Yankeedom, New Netherland, the Midlands, Tidewater, Greater Appalachia, the Deep South, El Norte, the Far West, New France, and the Left Coast. Colin deftly traces the historical origins of each of these cultural regions and then explains how their particular character affected&#8211;and continues to affect&#8211;North American history. What this amounts to is a new and refreshing way to look at the North American past and present.
And not only that. It turns out I&#8217;m a Midlander and my wife is a Yankee. That actually explains a lot&#8230;

		<itunes:summary>I vividly recall a time in my life&#8211;especially my late teens and early twenties&#8211;when I thought I could be anyone but had no idea which anyone to be. For this I blame (or credit) my liberal arts education, which convinced me that there was really nothing I couldn&#8217;t master but gave me little or no indication of  what I should do (beyond platitudes like &#8220;discover myself&#8221; and &#8220;do good&#8221;). So I thrashed about, armed with an ounce of knowledge and a ton of arrogance. I was insufferable. I won&#8217;t go into details, but let me just say my quest to discover who I was ended rather badly, albeit not in the long term. Life taught me what my liberal arts education couldn&#8217;t: that I was who I was and not much more.
Having read Rosamund Bartlett&#8216;s excellent Tolstoy: A Russia Life (Houghton Mifflin, 2011), I&#8217;m left wondering if Tolstoy ever came to this realization. Throughout his life, he searched for his true self. His launching pad was not a liberal arts education, but rather an aristocratic background, a flock of tutors, and a remarkable talent. The first taught Tolstoy that he could do anything he wanted (which was largely true as it concerned the serfs that Tolstoy&#8217;s family owned); the second  gave him the cultural tools he needed to conduct his search; and the third gave him the ability to rise above all the other Russian aristocrats who were trying to figure out what they should do and where Russia should go. Tolstoy tried on Russian identities the way you try on cloths at a department store. He was, by turns, a student, a slacker, an enfant terrible, a rake, a soldier, a pianist, a slave master, a gambler, a journalist, a teacher, a bee-keeper, a patriarch, a national poet, a peasant, a pundit, and a child-of-nature. At the end of his life he became a holy fool, or monk, or cult leader&#8211;take your pick. Some see this identity as his final destination, his moment of Buddha-like enlightenment. I don&#8217;t think so. Had he lived another five years he would have become someone else. Tolstoy&#8211;perpetual adolescent.Thankfully for us, the common thread in his loosely woven life was writing. He was a always a writer, and one with preternatural descriptive and dramatic gifts.
Rosamund Bartlett is also a writer with considerable gifts, which explains why her grasp of Tolstoy is so solid and why her ability to vividly portray him so great.  If you want to know Tolstoy, read Bartlett.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in Sports] Modern sports carry the DNA of the games of ancient Greece and Rome. This genetic inheritance will be most apparent next summer, when London hosts the 30th Summer Olympic Games. But these genes are also expressed any time we visit a stadium or arena to watch athletes compete. The Greeks also called a competitor an &#8220;athletes,&#8221; a word derived from the root &#8220;athlon,&#8221; meaning “prize.” The stadion was the field of competition at Olympia, as well as the marquee event at the ancient games: a sprint of roughly 200 meters. Arena, meanwhile, was the Latin word for the sand that covered the floor of an amphitheater, ideal for absorbing the blood of slaughtered animals and executed criminals (but only infrequently, as we’ll learn, the blood of slain gladiators). And even when we visit the gym for our own workout, we are manifesting our genetic heritage. The Greeks also frequented the gymnasion for physical training. But as this was ancient Greece, the exercises at a gymnasion were performed gymnos—naked.
As David Potter points out in his survey of Greek and Roman games, The Victor’s Crown: A History of Ancient Sport from Homer to Byzantium(Oxford University Press, 2011), there have been only two periods in human history when spectator sports have had a prominent place in society and culture: our own modern age, and the ancient and classical eras in the Mediterranean. The parallels between ancient and modern games are numerous. The athletes of millennia ago, whether Olympic competitors or Roman chariot racers, were celebrities of their day, lauded by the earliest sports columnists (Greek lyric poets) and fan bloggers (Roman graffiti scribblers). They were also well rewarded. Olympic victors were the objects of bidding wars among competing Greek cities, similar to today’s free agency and transfer windows, while the richest athlete of any age remains the Roman charioteer Diolces, whose wealth was surpassed only by the emperor’s.
There is also plenty that is surprising in Potter’s book—and hopefully our interview. The Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Latin and Greek at the University of Michigan, David has spent his career writing and teaching about the classical age. And as a former college wrestler and member of the university’s athletics advisory board, he has an inside knowledge of contemporary sports. He tells us of the links between ancient and modern athletics, the strange and gory details of past competitions, and the accuracy of films like Gladiator. Along the way, we learn about figures like Diocles, the six-time Olympic champion wrestler Milo of Croton, and the poet who was the Grantland Rice of ancient Greece. If you are a fan of the Olympics, or of Gladiator and Spartacus, you’ll enjoy this tour of the ancient world.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in History] Despite its focus on education, Sally Ninham&#8216;s recent book, A Cohort of Pioneers: Australian Postgraduate Students and American Postgraduate Degrees, 1949-1964 (Connor Court Publishing, 2011), covers a lot of ground: the waning of Australian-British ties, the rise of Australian identity, post-war Australian-US relations, and much more. The book is also personal: it details her own family’s experiences as young professionals studying in the United States after the Second World War.  The discovery of a cache of family letters led her to consider how and why Australians went to study in the United States, and how the experience transformed Australia’s own higher education system and politics in subsequent decades.  For the Australian students, American education opened the prospect of an Australia less dependent upon the United Kingdom. For the United States, then fighting the Cold War, Australian students opened the prospect of closer ties to Australia, an important ally. The book, which is built on an impressive body of oral history interviews, personal letters, and memoirs, is both an important cultural document and a very readable intellectual history.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>If Edith Sheffer&#8216;s excellent Burned Bridge: How East and West Germans Made the Iron Curtain (Oxford UP, 2011) has a single lesson, it&#8217;s that dividing a country is not as easy as you might think. You don&#8217;t just draw a line and tell people that it&#8217;s now the &#8220;border,&#8221; for in order for borders to be borders, they have to be seen as such. Sheffer shows that for quite a number of years after 1945, the Germans in Neustadt and Sonneberg&#8211;closely situated towns in, respectively, the American and Soviet zones of occupation&#8211;didn&#8217;t really know whether the border was a border and, if so, what kind of border it was or should be.
&#8220;It&#8221;&#8211;whatever it was&#8211;was shifting, lawless, contested, resented, profitable, and sometimes deadly. The Grenze at Burned Bridge was really a kind of anarchical region dividing people who were in no way different from one another but who were compelled to behave as if they were by two occupying powers. The degree to which they were so compelled differed and this made all the difference in the end (the end being 1990, the year of reunification). Years of Nazi propaganda had taught Germans to fear Communist Russians. So when the Soviets arrived in Sonneberg and began to rape and pillage, their fears were realized and they fled. When Soviets (with the help of East German Communists) imposed Stalinism and all that went with it, their fears were doubled and they fled.  And when Soviet order reduced once prosperous Sonneberg to a mere economic shadow of Wirtschaftwunder-era Neustadt, their fears were tripled and they fled. For the Soviets and their East German toadies, this &#8220;defection&#8221; was embarrassing, so they made what was an ill-defined, porous border zone into a militarized, nearly sealed wall.
For anyone familiar with Soviet border policy in the 1930s, what they did in Germany is not surprising. What is surprising (at least to me) is the Americans&#8217; and Neustadters&#8217; response to the influx of Easterners, namely, something between ambivalence and hostility. The former wanted order on the border and the latter wanted security from the Eastern &#8220;mob.&#8221; Both took active measures to keep the Ossis out, all the while issuing pronouncements about the necessity of Wiedervereinigung. The Soviets are responsible for the division of Germany, but, as Edith shows, they had help.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We&#8217;ve dealt with the question of how racial categories and conceptions evolve on New Books in History before, most notably in our interview with Nell Irving Painter. She told us about the history of &#8220;Whiteness.&#8221; Today we&#8217;ll return to the history of racial ideas and listen to Andrew Curran explain the history of &#8220;Blackness.&#8221;
Doubtless Europeans have noted that different humans from different parts of the globe look different for millennia. But it was only relatively recently, as Curran explains in  The Anatomy of Blackness: Science and Slavery in an Age of Enlightenment (Johns Hopkins UP, 2011), that they took a serious interest in explaining these differences in a manner we would call “scientific.” There are two major reasons for this tardiness. First, metaphysical and biblical schemes provided the primary context for the interpretation of the human until the mid eighteenth century. Second, the most important scientific communities in Europe–those of France and England–only began to examine the African in earnest at the same time that their plantation- and slave-based colonies in the Caribbean came on line in the seventeenth century. &#8220;Colonial expansion&#8221; and “Scientific Revolution” ran together, it seems, and it is in their confluence that we see the origins of modern color-based racial discourse.
That discourse, as Curran shows, was first worked out in what are sometimes called &#8220;Travel Accounts,&#8221; books that look for all the world like ethnographies. Europeans wrote thousands of them about every corner of the globe (Full disclosure: long ago I wrote a book about early European ethnographies of Old Russia). These books, in turn, provided grist (or &#8220;data&#8221;?) for the scientific mills of &#8220;naturalists&#8221; back home. At the same time these naturalists were looking outward for the origins of human difference, other scientifically-minded types were looking inwards. They were medical doctors, and more particularly anatomists. They wondered why, in the mechanical sense, black skin was black, and so they took black skin apart looking for mechanisms. And of course these twin discourses, ethnographic and medical, were intertwined with a third&#8211;that centered on the ethics of the then booming Atlantic slave-trade. Europeans wondered what science could tell them about the rightness or wrongness of African slavery.

This is an important contribution to an important topic. But it is also a model of how intellectual history should be done. Curran moves well beyond the parade of Big Thinkers that have long dominated the history of ideas. He reads them, to be sure, but he also reads what they read. By this technique, he moves deeper and deeper into the culture of ethnography, anatomy, and slavery in search of  the origins and forms of &#8220;Blackness.&#8221;

		<itunes:summary>[Cross-posted from New Books in Russian and Eurasian Studies] Most Westerners know about the Gulag (aka &#8220;Chief Administration of Corrective Labor Camps and Colonies&#8221;) thanks to Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s eloquent, heart-wrenching Gulag Archipelago. Since the publication of that book in 1973 (and largely thanks to it), the Gulag has come to symbolize the horrors of Stalinism. Made up of a vast network of concentration camps, slave labor camps, and (according to some) death camps, the Gulag was a horrible thing indeed. Under Stalin some 18 million people were imprisoned in it; no less than 1.6 million of them died while inmates.
The incredible brutality and injustice of the Gulag system is beyond dispute. Yet, as Steven Barnes points out in his new book Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society (Princeton UP, 2011), the Soviet authorities used the Gulag not only to punish and kill, but also to &#8220;correct.&#8221; They invested significant resources in the reeducation, rehabilitation, and redemption of prisoners, over 20% of whom were released every year. The vast majority of Gulag prisoners did not die there; they survived the experience and (for good or ill) were changed by it. And as they moved through the system in their millions, and were transformed by Gulag incarceration, Soviet society changed as well. In this fine book Barnes tells us how.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>If you&#8217;ve ever lived in New York City, you know exactly what a &#8220;pre-war building&#8221; is. First and foremost, it&#8217;s better than a &#8220;post-war building.&#8221; Why, you might ask, is that so?
Well part of the reason has to do with wartime and post-war &#8220;urban renewal,&#8221; that is, the process by which the Washington, big city governments, big city banks, and big city developers came together to clear &#8220;slums&#8221; and erect modern (really &#8220;modernist&#8221;) apartment blocks and complexes of apartment blocks. Think &#8220;the projects&#8221; (or, more generally, &#8220;public housing&#8220;). In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the New York City Housing Authority supervised the construction of a lot of them. Today roughly 500,000 New Yorkers live in them. And many of them, I would guess, probably wish they lived in &#8220;pre-war buildings.&#8221;
Sandy Zipp does a wonderful job of telling the story of this re-making of New York in his fascinating book Manhattan Projects: The Rise and Fall of Urban Renewal in Cold War New York (Oxford UP, 2010). Along the way, myths are busted (&#8220;the projects&#8221; were not built for poor folks), villains are redeemed (Robert Moses wasn&#8217;t really such a bad guy), and ugly buildings are explained (many serious people really thought tower blocks were beautiful). The book makes plain why large chunks of Manhattan (and many other cities) look the way they do and why they are thought of the way they are. Read it and find out.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>When I was an undergraduate, I noticed that there were certain books that seemed to be unavoidable (at least at my liberal arts college). They were assigned in many classes, and they were discussed in many others. Reading them seemed to be a secret requirement for graduation. These &#8221;liberal-arts essentials&#8221; included Plato&#8217;s Republic, Rousseau&#8217;s Social Contract, Lockes&#8217; Two Treatises on Government (especially the second), Kant&#8217;s Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics, Marx and Engels&#8217; The Communist Manifesto, Freud&#8217;s Civilization and its Discontents, and John Bergers&#8217; Ways of Seeing.
Another was William Sheridan Allen&#8217;s The Nazi Seizure of Power: The Experience of a Single German Town, 1922-1945 (Quadrangle Books, 1965). It explained the rise of National Socialism in a new and revealing way: from the bottom up. In Sheridan Allen&#8217;s story, the local politicians, shopkeepers, and housewives of Northeim (Hanover) moved to the fore, while Hitler, Goering, and Goebbels remained in the background. Here the locals &#8220;made history,&#8221; and they did so ways that we would all recognize from our own local communities.
Charles McKinney, Jr. has written a similar book, though one with a much happier ending. Greater Freedom: The Evolution of the Civil Rights Struggle in Wilson, North Carolina (UPA, 2010) tells the tale of how one small city in the South negotiated the rough transition from Jim Crow to Civil Rights and beyond. In McKinney&#8217;s telling, the people of Wilson (North Carolina) make history; Martin Luther King, et al. remain off stage. These common folks&#8211;both Black and White&#8211;discuss, argue, protest, sue, threaten, fight, organize, lobby, and vote their way to a &#8220;greater freedom&#8221; over the course of many decades. In the pages of McKinney&#8217;s fine book, we see how Civil Rights actually happened &#8220;on the ground.&#8221; I hope it becomes required reading as Sheridan Allen&#8217;s book once was.</itunes:summary>

Don&#8217;t believe it.  Consider this: the set of academic departments that one finds in most &#8220;colleges of liberal arts and sciences&#8221;&#8211;history, chemistry, sociology, physics, and so on&#8211;has remained remarkably stable for many decades. How, exactly, is that &#8220;radical?&#8221;
Yet as Mikaila Lemonik Arthur shows in her enlightening book Student Activism and Curricular Change in Higher Education (Ashgate, 2011), some curricular changes have occurred, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. When I went to college in the 1980s, interdisciplinary minors and majors such as Women&#8217;s&#8217; Studies, Asian-American Studies, and Queer Studies (the three cases Lemonik Arthur analyses) were in their infancy. Now the first is nearly ubiquitous, the second is growing rapidly, and the third is gaining steam.
How did these new &#8220;identity studies&#8221; disciplines succeed in finding a place at the already-full academic table despite the residence of many stakeholders? Lemonik Arthur&#8217;s answer is complicated, but suggests that the deans are more nimble that we&#8211;or rather I&#8211;thought. Beginning in the late 1960s, they saw rising demand for courses in these emerging disciplines, some of which was signaled by waves of student activism. They responded by increasing the supply, albeit slowly. The first institutions to do so were of lessor status. Once they showed that the &#8220;identity studies&#8221; courses were viable in terms of enrollment and didn&#8217;t harm (and in fact helped) recruitment and fund-raising efforts, the more prestigious schools followed. Their status rose and the money began to flow. These two developments, in turn, allowed the &#8220;identity studies&#8221; disciplines to institutionalize, that is, to secure places among (actually, between) departments and in course catalogue.

This is a fascinating study of how even authoritarian institutions (like most colleges and universities!) can sometimes prove responsive to their clients.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>When I was in college in the 1980s, I liked to listen to Iggy Pop (aka James Newell Osterberg, Jr.). I was always mystified, however, by his song &#8220;Five Foot One,&#8221; with its odd and catchy refrain &#8220;I wish life could be/Swed-ish mag-a-zines!&#8221;  What in the heck did that mean? I&#8217;d never seen a &#8220;Swed-ish mag-a-zine.&#8221; Thanks to Elizabeth Heineman&#8216;s wonderful book  Before Porn Was Legal: The Erotica Empire of Beate Uhse (University of Chicago Press, 2011), now I understand. You see, the last and perhaps most significant Swedish contribution (if that&#8217;s what it was) to Western Civilization was legalized hardcore porn. In the early 1970s the Swedes (and their porn-allies, the Danes) flooded European markets with the stuff. The Scandinavians were making a killing.
As Lisa explains, the &#8220;Swedish Invasion&#8221; put the queen of the German erotica industry, Beate Uhse, in something of a bind &#8211; but it also came at a moment of great opportunity. In the first two decades after World War II, the Luftwaffe pilot-turned erotica entrepreneur had built a sex empire legitimized by the idea that erotica helped married, heterosexual couples have more fulfilling relationships. After all, the bread and butter of the industry were condoms (for customers who could hardly afford babies, given wartime devastation) and basic how-to manuals (for customers suffered from dire sexual ignorance). And the demand was there: by the early 1960s, fully half of West German household had patronized a mail-order erotica firm. But by the end of that decade, pornography &#8211; both homegrown and imported &#8211; was the backbone of the industry. So what, exactly, was the social mission of the erotica industry in this brave new world? In the end, the market decided with more than a little help from liberalism: German men wanted porn and the West German courts and Parliament couldn&#8217;t think of a reason not to let them have it. And so it is that you can buy porn on every high street in Germany, often in a Beate Uhse Erotik-Shop (Warning: really NSFW).
This is a terrifically interesting book. Read it.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>I was still in high school the year the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, 1979. I remember reading about it in Time magazine and watching President Carter denounce it on TV. The Soviets, everyone said, were bent on ruling the world. Détente had been a ploy to lull us to sleep. In Afghanistan, the Communists had renewed their campaign. We had to do something. So we didn&#8217;t go to &#8220;their&#8221; Olympics. Oddly, that brave gesture failed to bring them around to our way of thinking.
There are two really wonderful things about Sir Rodric Braithwaite&#8216;s new book Afgantsy: The Russians in Afghanistan, 1979-89 (Oxford UP, 2011). First, Sir Rodric shows in excruciating detail just how wrong we got it. The tiny cabal of Soviet leaders who sent the Red Army into Afghanistan weren&#8217;t imperialists pursuing some grand strategy to conquer the globe. They were scared, sometimes confused old men in a situation that was made impossible by conflicting, contradictory aims. They wanted to protect the USSR&#8217;s southern boarder; they wanted to keep the US out of the region; they wanted to stop the local Communist Party from turning Afghanistan into another Cambodia; they wanted to protect their personal friends and allies, people they knew, trusted, and liked; and, almost more than anything else, they wanted to give the Afghanis peace, stability, and prosperity so they just wouldn&#8217;t have to think about Afghanistan ever again. That&#8217;s right, the men in the Kremlin were not evil; they wanted to do good, if only for their own sake.
The trouble was&#8211;and this brings us to the second wonderful aspect of Sir Rodric&#8217;s book&#8211;they couldn&#8217;t accomplish all these things. They knew this: the horrible example of America&#8217;s effort to &#8220;help&#8221; Vietnam was right before their eyes. But they were frightened, prone to catastrophic thinking, and didn&#8217;t want to appear weak. So they had to do something. They couldn&#8217;t very well refuse to go to their own Olympics. So, by steps, they invested Afghanistan. First there were advisors. Then there were troops to protect the advisors. Then there was political unrest, calls for help, and the dispatch of larger army units to &#8220;restore order.&#8221; Order was not restored, so the generals (though not all of them) reasonably asked for more troops. And so it went until the Soviets conquered Afghanistan but did not hold it; ruled it but did not govern it; won every battle in it but lost the war against it.

If this sounds familiar to Americans, it should.

		<itunes:summary>It&#8217;s safe to say that nobody but genocidaires likes genocide. It&#8217;s also safe to say that everyone but genocidaires wants to halt on-going campaigns of mass murder and prevent future ones. The question, of course, is how to do this in practice.
Keith Pomakoy&#8217;s significant new book  Helping Humanity: American Policy and Genocide Rescue (Lexington Books, 2011) explores exactly this question by analyzing American responses to mass murder over the past 125 years. The results are surprising. Contra Samantha Power, Pomakoy demonstrates that the United States has been anything but indifferent to the suffering of genocide victims abroad. The U.S. has taken measures to stop genocidal campaigns against Cubans, Armenians, Ukrainians, Jews, Cambodians, Bantus, Tutsis, Bosnian Muslims, and Albanians. These measures were not uniform: they were sometimes military (as in the case of Cuba), sometimes humanitarian (as in the case of the Armenians), and sometimes purely diplomatic (as in the case of the Ukrainians). Neither were they always effective: the U.S. was able to halt the Spanish attack on Cubans, while it was unable to do anything of significance to ameliorate the suffering of the Ukrainians.
The primary lesson of Pomakoy&#8217;s book&#8211;and I hope it is a lesson that the Obama administration hears&#8211;is that the ability of the U.S. to halt genocidal campaigns is very limited. This is particularly true in cases in which a powerful and distant genocidal state is determined to kill. The U.S. simply could not have halted the Ottoman campaign against the Armenians, the Stalinist campaign against the Ukrainians, or the Nazi campaign against the Jews. But even in instances where the genocidal state is weak, there is not a lot the U.S. can do. Military intervention often does more harm than good in the long term (as in Iraq) and humanitarian intervention often difficult (as in North Korea). Diplomatic and economic pressure almost never works.

Liberal internationalists like Power tell us that the U.S. must stop genocide by any means necessary. Fine. But American policymakers must recognize that we almost never have the means necessary to halt it. The most we can usually do is ease the suffering of the victims of genocide and pray for it to end quickly.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>It takes a brave historian to take on the orthodoxy regarding the rise and fall of lynching in the United States. That orthodoxy holds that lynching in the South was a &#8216;system of social control&#8217; in which whites used organized terror to oppress blacks. You can find this thesis in numerous monographs, textbooks, and in the popular press. It&#8217;s one of those things &#8220;everybody knows.&#8221;
But according to Robert Thurston&#8217;s provocative new book Lynching: American Mob Murder in Global Perspective  (Ashgate, 2011) the standard &#8216;social control&#8217; line is inadequate.  It cannot explain when lynching started or when it ended; why lynching occurred in some places often and others never; and why the period in question witnessed a considerable amount of intra-racial lynching. The &#8216;social control&#8217; thesis fails because it tries to put a square peg (the evidence) in a round hole (the concept of systematic oppression through terror). Thurston shows that lynching, though hardly accidental, was simply too occasional and too random to be called &#8216;systemic.&#8217; He argues that lynching was&#8211;and remains where we find it today&#8211;a collective response to political instability, especially instability caused by a lack of legitimate and effective authority. When people don&#8217;t trust the sheriff or there is no sheriff, they are going to take matters into their own hands. This sort of &#8216;rough justice&#8217; is wildly imperfect: the mob often gets the wrong man. And it is not only about justice: the mob often cynically takes the chaos provided by &#8216;rough justice&#8217; to settle old scores, some of which may be racist (Post-Reconstruction America) or classist (Revolutionary Russia) or both. But there is no &#8216;system&#8217; here, except in the sense of a widespread pattern of collective action triggered by a reasonably common political situation, namely the lack of legitimate, effective authority.
Thurston&#8217;s emphasis on authority (or the lack of it) in explaining lynching enables him to present a new thesis as to why lynching abated considerably in the U.S. after 1892. The primary reason, he says, is that Whites succeed in creating a true system of social control, namely, Jim Crow. What was chaotic and unstable became structured and steady, though in a manner that to us (rightly) seems manifestly unjust. Thurston also points to other factors that contributed to the decline of lynching, for example the rising status of blacks in the South and changing international attitudes about race. These factors&#8211;Jim Crow, black advancement, anti-racism&#8211;did not destroy a &#8216;system of social control.&#8217; They simply made &#8216;rough justice&#8217; impracticable for and  unacceptable to most white and black citizens.

This is an important book and should be widely read and discussed. I hope that Ashgate will bring out a paperback edition, or that the author will be persuaded to write and publish a shorter, popularly-oriented version.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>One of the most disturbing insights made by practitioners of &#8220;Big History&#8221; is that the distinction between geologic time and human time has collapsed in our era. The forces that drove geologic time&#8211;plate tectonics, the orientation of the Earth&#8217;s axis relative to the sun, volcanic activity&#8211;were distinct from the forces that drove human time&#8211;evolution, technological change, population growth. To be sure, they interacted. But the causal arrow always went from geologic change to human change. As Anthony Penna rightly points out in The Human Footprint: A Global Environmental History (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), the causal arrow now goes in both directions. Not only do we adapt to the environment, but the environment is adapting to us, and mightily. We are ushering in a new geological period sometimes called the Anthropocene&#8211;the era defined by human activity. 
It&#8217;s important to point out that this is not the first time biology has shaped geology: we have good evidence, for example, that 2.4 billion years ago cyanobacteria radically altered the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere by releasing enormous quantities of free oxygen (&#8220;The Great Oxygenization Event&#8220;). This time, however, it&#8217;s different. Cyanobacteria are essentially dumb machines. They could not choose whether they would oxygenate the atmosphere or not. In contrast, we are smart machines. We can choose how we want to alter the environment. Penna tells the story of how we have been altering the environment&#8211;and choosing to alter the environment&#8211;for the past 50,000 years, and with particular vigor in the past several hundred. We are now masters not only of our own fate, but the fate of the Earth and all life on it. We need to wake up to that fact, and we should thank Anthony Penna for helping to stir us from our slumbers. </itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Being a historian is a bit of a slog: years in graduate school, more years in dusty libraries and archives, and even more years teaching students who sometimes don&#8217;t seem interested in learning what you have to teach. But the job does have its pleasures, and one of the greatest&#8211;and surely the guiltiest&#8211;is watching people screw history up. Not a day goes by when we don&#8217;t see someone get it wrong, dead wrong, or so wrong that it&#8217;s not even wrong. To us, history is firmly anchored in authenticated sources that have been subjected to intense scrutiny and debate by people who know what they are talking about. To most other folks (though surely none of the people reading these words), history is something a dimly remembered teacher taught you, something you saw on the &#8220;History Channel,&#8221; or something someone told you once. This kind of history is not anchored in anything other than popular ideas and attitudes, which themselves are constantly changing. In this light, it&#8217;s not particularly surprising that when most people talk about history, they don&#8217;t get things quite right. When people make historical mistakes, we historians earnestly knit our brows and solemnly bemoan the deficit of historical knowledge. Privately we sometimes chuckle. I&#8217;ve done this myself, and I have to tell you I feel bad about it.
I can only imagine, then, that Christopher Krebs had an absolute blast writing A Most Dangerous Book: Tacitus&#8217;s Germania from the Roman Empire to the Third Reich (Norton, 2011), for it is an epic tale of getting it wrong, history-wise. Beginning about half a millennium ago, people began to say all kinds of wrongheaded things about Tacitus&#8217;s thin volume: that Tacitus was writing about &#8220;Germans&#8221; (he wasn&#8217;t); that he knew a lot about &#8220;Germans&#8221; (he didn&#8217;t); that he uniformly praised &#8220;Germans&#8221; (nope); that the traits he ascribes to &#8220;Germans&#8221; can be found among modern German-speakers (wrong again).
Were it not for the fact that these &#8220;interpretations&#8221; emboldened evil people (especially the Nazis) to do evil things (too numerous to recount), this exercise in bad history would be funny. But, as Krebs points out, it&#8217;s really not very funny at all. It&#8217;s a reminder that we professional historians have a duty to make sure we get what we say about the past straight, or else. Christopher Krebs is clearly fulfilling his duty in this important, readable, and very witty book. It deserves a wide audience. That means you.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>When I arrived at college in the early 1980s, drugs were cool, music was cool, and drug-music was especially cool. The coolest of the cool drug-music bands was The Velvet Underground. They were from the mean streets of New York City (The Doors were from the soft parade of L.A&#8230;.); they hung out with Andy Warhol (The Beatles hung out with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#8230;); they had a female drummer (The Grateful Dead had two drummers, but that still didn&#8217;t help&#8230;); and, of course, they did heroin. Or at least they wrote a famous song about it. We did not do heroin, but we thought that those who did&#8211;like Lou Reed and the rest&#8211;were hipper than hip. I imagine we would have done it if there had been any around (thank God for small favors). 
We thought we had discovered something new. But as Eric C. Schneider points out in his marvelous Smack: Heroin and the American City (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008), the conjunction of music, heroin, and cool was hardly an invention of my generation. The three came together in the 1940s, when smack-using bebop players (think Charlie Parker) taught the &#8220;Beat Generation&#8221; that heroin was hip. Neither was my generation the last to succumb to a heroin fad. The triad of music, heroin, and cool united again in the 1990s, when drug-addled pop-culture icons such as Jim Carroll (The Basketball Diaries), Kurt Cobain (Nirvana), and Calvin Klein (of &#8220;heroin chic&#8221; fame) taught &#8220;Generation X&#8221; the same lesson. History, or at least the history of heroin, repeats itself.
For white, middle-class folks like me heroin chic was an episode, a rebellious moment in an otherwise &#8220;normal&#8221; American life. But as Schneider makes clear, the passage of heroin from cultural elites to the population at large was not always so benign, particularly in the declining inner-cities of the 1960s and 1970s. Here heroin had nothing to do with being cool and everything to do with earning a living and escaping reality. For millions of impoverished, hopeless, urban-dwelling hispanics and blacks, heroin was a paycheck and a checkout. The drug helped destroy the people in the inner-city, and thus the inner-city itself. 

In response to the &#8220;heroin epidemic&#8221; of the 1960s and 1970s, the government launched the first war on drugs, focusing its energy on &#8220;pushers.&#8221; But there were no &#8220;pushers&#8221; because&#8211;and this is the greatest insight in a book full of great insights&#8211;pushing was not the way heroin use spread, either among middle-class college kids or the down-and-out of New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia. No one pushed heroin on anyone. Rather, users taught their friends how to use; in turn, those friends&#8211;now users&#8211;taught their friends, and so on. Heroin stealthily spread through personal networks. The only part of the process that was visible was the result: in the case of suburban college kids, bad grades and rehab; in the case of poor urban hispanics and blacks,  crime and incarceration. 
Not surprisingly, when the heroin &#8220;epidemic&#8221; ended, it was not due to the war on drugs. Heroin simply fell out of fashion, in this case being replaced by another fashionable drug, powder and crack cocaine. Today we are fighting cocaine just as we fought heroin, and, by all appearances, with similar success. </itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>I think this is really interesting. Among the thousands of iconic and easily recognizable photographs of segregated water fountains in the American South, you will almost never find one that features a black woman, a white woman or a white man drinking. They are nearly all of black men drinking. Why is that?
In her fine and thoughtful book Signs of the Times: The Visual Politics of Jim Crow (University of California Press, 2010), Elizabeth Abel tells us why. Segregation, like many social phenomena, had a triple life. 1) It was a thing, part of an objective reality now past (one wants to cite Ranke here). 2) It was a thing seen, an object filtered through the subjective experience of viewers (one wants to cite Kant here). 3) And it was a thing shown, a sign made by one person to be communicated to others (one wants to cite Saussure here). We can see these three lives in the sources Abel examines: photographs of segregation signs: &#8220;Whites Only&#8221;, &#8220;No Negroes&#8221;, &#8220;Colored Entrance&#8221;, and so on. They simultaneously tell us about the way segregation actually worked (Ranke), the way participants observed it (Kant), and the way photographers tried to show it to their audiences (Saussure). Able analyses all three lives, but her focus&#8211;and the explanation for the black-man-at-a-water-fountain photographic cliché&#8211;is really to be found in her investigation of the third. The photographers, most of whom were white liberal northerners, framed the depictions of the signs so as to convince spectators that segregation was degrading to blacks. Thus they usually moved whites completely out of the frame. Moreover, they elected to focus attention on the subject who could be most humiliated because that subject had, relatively speaking, the most status. So black men (high status) were shown rather than black women (low status). 
This example is only one of Abel&#8217;s many fine readings of these photographs. There are many others. I encourage you to pick up the book and see for yourself. </itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Today is Memorial Day here in the United States, the day on which we remember those who have fought and died in the service of our country. It&#8217;s fitting, then, that we are talking to Adam Hochschild about his To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918 (Houghton Mifflin, 2011).
The book itself is a memorial of sorts, or rather a reminder of what may, in hindsight, seem to us to have been a kind of collective insanity. The Great Powers fought World War I over nothing in particular. They pursued no great cause, sought to right no terrible injustice. They appear to us, therefore, to have fought for no good reason and to have been, therefore, out of their heads. But here we are wrong, for the combatants were not insane. Not at all. They simply lived in a different world and, therefore, thought differently than we do. They fought, as Adam points out, because they wanted to fight. For them, the bloody struggle of nation against nation was a necessary and salutary phenomenon. War made them who they were; if they did not fight, they were nothing. And so they fought bravely and died in droves over nothing, really, but honor. Of course there were exceptions, people much like us who believed that war was neither necessary nor salutary in any way. Adam sensitively chronicles their (futile) attempts to convince their kin and countrymen that war all bad and no good. They, too, fought bravely and sometimes died. We should remember them, too, on this Memorial Day.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>What is the role of personality in shaping history? Shortly before the beginning of the First World War, the German sociologist Max Weber puzzled over this question. He was sure that there was a kind of authority that drew strength from character itself. He called this authority &#8220;charismatic,&#8221; a type of legitimate political power that rested &#8220;on devotion to the exceptional sanctity, heroism or exemplary character of an individual person, and of the normative patterns or order revealed or ordained by him.&#8221; The charismatic leader is not like us. In fact, he is not like anyone. He is sui generis, a mysterious force of nature, a sort of political demiurge.
According to Jonathan Steinberg, Weber may well have had Otto von Bismarck in mind when he defined charismatic authority. In his wonderful Bismarck: A Life (Oxford UP, 2011), Steinberg argues that Bismarck&#8217;s successes (and some of his failures) can be largely attributed to the awesome force of his personality. Not &#8220;social structures.&#8221; Not &#8220;historical patterns.&#8221; Not &#8220;underlying forces.&#8221; But charisma pure and simple. Time and again Steinberg finds those around Bismarck attesting to the fact that he just wasn&#8217;t like everyone else. He was smarter, wittier, stronger, more willful, more cunning, more temperamental, and in most ways larger than life. And this was the nearly uniform (though not always positive) assessment of the some of the most impressive figures of his day. It&#8217;s a compelling case.
And it provokes a question about German political culture, for Bismarck was not the first or the last &#8220;genius&#8221; to rule some or all of the Reich. Fredrick the Great preceded him, and Hitler followed. What are we to make of that? I&#8217;ll leave it to you to decide.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>I used to live in Washington DC, not far from a place I learned to call the &#8220;U Street Corridor.&#8221; I really had no idea why it was a &#8220;corridor&#8221; (most places in DC are just &#8220;streets&#8221;) or why a lot of folks seemed to make a big deal out if it. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. It was nice. There are coffee shops, jazz clubs, and the place is full of beautiful late Victorian architecture. But I confess I really didn&#8217;t understand what the &#8220;U Street Corridor&#8221; was.
Having read Blair Ruble&#8216;s terrific Washington&#8217;s U Street: A Biography (Johns Hopkins UP/Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2010), I can confidently say that now I get it. U Street was arguably the first urban area in the post-bellum United States in which African Americans formed a vital, sophisticated, wealthy, and identifiably modern &#8220;negro&#8221; (as they would have said) culture. Today we take it for granted that African Americans make a vital contribution to the cultural life (though not only that) of the United States. At the end of the Civil War, that wasn&#8217;t so. The vast majority of Blacks were southern, rural, and poor. If they appeared on the stage of national culture (and they almost never did), it was through the devices of minstrels in black-face.  As Ruble points out, all that changed on U Street in the early 20th century, the birthplace of modern African American culture. Now I know, and I&#8217;m glad I do. Read the book, and you&#8217;ll know to0.

One of the standard assumptions of modern Western social science (history included) is that material conditions drive historical development. All of the &#8220;Great Transitions&#8221; in world history&#8211;the origins of agriculture, the birth of cities, the rise of high culture, the industrial revolution&#8211;can, so most Western social scientists claim, be associated with some condition that compelled otherwise conservative humans to act in new ways. This premise is of course most closely linked to Marx, but it is found throughout post-Marxist big picture scholarship (including my own humble contribution to that literature). 
Ricardo Duchesne argues in his new The Uniqueness of Western Civilization (Brill, 2011) that we have it all wrong. History, he claims, is driven by creative people and their ideas, not by the conditions they find themselves in. If you see a bit of Hegel and Nietzsche here, you are not wrong: Duchesne embraces them both (and throws in a considerable amount of Weber to boot). But he goes much further. He trys to demonstrate using the best literature available on a wide variety of topics that the Hegelian-Nietzschian view of historical development is correct. This is not a book of theory alone; it&#8217;s an attempt to empirically demonstrate a theory. Even more radically, Duchesne uses the Hegelian-Nietzschian view to argue that since the invasion of the Indo-Europeans, a pastoral people who were imbued with unique aristocratic-warrior ethos, the West has been more creative than other world historical civilizations, and that this creativity explains in large measure the &#8220;Great Divergence&#8221; that we have seen in modern time. 

This is a challenging book, and one that requires study. It is not light reading. But anyone who is brave enough to try to understand what it says will be greatly rewarded. I know I was. 
PS: Brill, could you please put out an affordable paperback edition of this book, or perhaps release it in electronic version once it&#8217;s been sold to all the libraries that will buy it?</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>When I was an undergraduate, I fell in love with Montesquieu&#8217;s Spirit of the Laws. In the book Montesquieu reduces a set of disparate, seemingly unconnected facts arrayed over centuries and continents into a single, coherent theory of remarkable explanitory power. Alas, grand theoretical books like Spirit of the Laws are out of fashion today, not only because the human sciences are gripped by particularism (&#8220;more and more about less and less), but also because we don&#8217;t train students to think like Montesqueiu any more.
In his excellent The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2011), Francis Fukuyama bucks the trend. Of course, he&#8217;s done it before with elegant and persuasive books about the fall of communism, state-building, trust, and biotechnology among other big topics. Here he takes on the emergence of modern political institutions, or rather three modern political institutions: the state, the rule of law, and accountable government. He begins with human nature, takes us through a massive comparison of the political trajectories of world-historical civilizations (Chinese, Indian, Middle Eastern, European), and, in so doing, tells us why the world political order looks the way it does today. His answers are surprising, and not directly in line with what might be called the &#8220;conventional thinking&#8221; about these things.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We should be skeptical of what is sometimes called &#8220;Jew counting&#8221; and all it implies. Yet it cannot be denied that Jews played a pivotal and (dare we say) disproportionate role in moving the West from a pre-modern to a modern condition. Take the media. Most people know that Jews, though hardly alone, built much of the film industry. Fewer people will know, however, that Jews&#8211;again, though hardly alone&#8211;were central to the birth of photojournalism. Robert Capa, arguably the most famous photojournalist of the last century, was, for example, born Endre Friedmann. 
In his fine book Through Soviet Jewish Eyes: Photography, War, and the Holocaust (Rutgers University Press, 2010), historian David Shneer explores the ways in which Jews were instrumental in the creation of Soviet photojournalism and the ways in which their Jewishness&#8211;acknowledged or unacknowledged, accepted or completely rejected&#8211;affected the way they did their jobs and how they experienced what they saw and shot.  The book is about identity as much as it is about photography (though it is about that as well). These pioneers of photojournalism were Jews whether they liked it or not. It said so on their passports. Yet they struggled with what that meant and how it should (or shouldn&#8217;t) influence their art. David does an excellent job in explaining how they negotiated Jewishness through revolution,  socialism, Stalinism, world war, and the destruction of Eastern European Jewry itself.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Most of us live in a world of nations. If you were born and live in the Republic of X, then you probably speak X-ian, are a citizen of X, and would gladly fight and die for your X-ian brothers and sisters. If, however, you were born and live in the Republic of X and you are not&#8211;by self-proclaimed identity&#8211;X-ian, then you are, well, a problem. 
But it wasn&#8217;t always so. Prior to the nineteenth century, people generally did not live in a world of nations. They lived in a world of empires. Now in hindsight, we say that these empires were &#8220;multinational,&#8221; that is, they were made up of nations. But the elites who ran the empires didn&#8217;t think so. They saw them as made up of territories where the sovereign&#8217;s writ ran, not &#8220;nations&#8221; that the sovereign ruled (though there was some of that as well).
As Michael A. Reynolds points out in his fine book Shattering Empires: The Clash and Collapse of the Ottoman and Russian Empires, 1908-1918 (Cambridge UP, 2011), European imperial elites of the nineteenth century faced a crisis when nations&#8211;and the political doctrine that said they should be self-governing, &#8220;nationalism&#8221;&#8211;began to grow in strength. The idea of nations and the program of nationalism were born in Western and Central Europe, where they caused some but not too much difficulty, at least at first (a story we will have to leave aside). When, however, the nation-states of Western and Central Europe began to threaten, territorially speaking, the empires of Eastern Europe, and to export the doctrine of nationalism to those regions, the real trouble began. For Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman elites understood that war and nationalism in the imperial context would likely mean the end of empire. One could not fight external and internal enemies at the same time. They were not wrong in this. As Reynolds shows, they did the best they could, creating alliances with Western and Central European powers to buy time, fostering subversive nationalisms within the borders of their opponents, and, eventually, embracing nationalism and embarking on massive campaigns of ethnic cleansing and killing (most infamously in the case of the Armenians). In one case, they succeeded after a fashion in holding the empire together, at least for a time (Russia); in two others they failed (Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire). But they were all victims of war and nationalism, forces they helped create and could not control.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>[This interview is re-posted with permission from Jenny Attiyeh's ThoughtCast.] Author Megan Marshall has recently written a well-received biography of Elizabeth, Mary, and Sophia Peabody: The Peabody Sisters: Three Women Who Ignited American Romanticism (Houghton Mifflin, 2005). The Peabodys were key players in the founding of the Transcendentalist movement in the early to mid 19th century. Elizabeth, the oldest, was intellectually precocious, learning Hebrew as a child so she could read the Old Testament. Mary was the middle sister, somewhat subdued by the dominant – and bossy – qualities of Elizabeth, and by the attention paid to the youngest, Sophia, who was practically an invalid. Nonetheless, Mary managed to become a teacher, writer and reformer. Sophia, beset by devastating migraines, spent most of her early years in bed. But when she had the strength, she painted. In an interview with ThoughtCast, Megan Marshall continues the tale…</itunes:summary>

The Nature of Sacrifice. A Biography of Charles Russell Lowell, Jr., 1835-64 (Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, 2005) tells the story of the short, heroic life of Charles Russell Lowell, Jr., an elite young cavalryman who embodied the promise of his generation. An ardent abolitionist and reformer, Lowell was also a brilliant battlefield strategist, and he turned the tide at the Battle of Cedar Creek in the Shenandoah Valley, a crucial victory for the North just two weeks shy of Lincoln’s re-election. Shot twice during the fighting, Lowell died at dawn the following day.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Here&#8217;s a simple&#8211;or should we say simplistic?&#8211;line of political reasoning: communities are made of people; people can either be sick or healthy; communities, therefore, are sick or healthy depending on the sickness or health of their people. This logic is powerful. It explains success: &#8220;We lost the war because we, individually and therefore communally, were ill.&#8221; And it explains victory: &#8220;We won the war because we, individually and there communally, were healthy.&#8221; And it suggests a program for political progress: get healthy and stay that way. It&#8217;s an old idea. We find it among the Greeks, the Romans, and throughout the various 19th- and early 20th-century programs for &#8220;national renewal&#8221; that swept Europe and Asia.
In his excellent book Body by Weimar: Athletes, Gender, and German Modernity (Oxford UP, 2010), Erik Jensen explores how Germans of the Weimar era were seduced by this &#8220;self-wellness = national-wellness&#8221; logic. They&#8217;d lost a war, and they couldn&#8217;t understand why. They knew that German culture wasn&#8217;t the problem. They believed&#8211;and with some good reason&#8211;that it was the most advanced in the world. So perhaps, they thought, the problem was some failure in themselves. They had grown weak and ill. Yes, that was it. So something had to be done about it. As Jensen shows, it was. And here&#8217;s the really interesting part, at least by my lights: it wasn&#8217;t done by the state. The Weimar government itself, though hardly disinterested, did not lead the campaign to make the German body well. Rather, &#8220;ordinary Germans&#8221; did. They began to play and follow sports, and to form countless clubs that played and followed sports. Sports became, well, &#8220;progressive&#8221; among the &#8220;right thinking people.&#8221; Rich and poor. Men and women. Everyone played. For Germany.</itunes:summary>

It wasn&#8217;t much fun, and it taught me that I did not want to pursue a career as a screw-counter.
But it&#8217;s important to remember that the benefits of mechanical production are largely due to making work mechanical. To get all that cheap stuff we know and love, we have to turn what were once complex jobs into simple jobs. In his excellent book Condensed Capitalism: Campbell Soup and the Pursuit of Cheap Production in the Twentieth Century (Cornell UP, 2009), Daniel Sidorick tells how the Campbell company made the cooking of soup&#8211;a magical art to many&#8211;into a mechanical process. The results were contradictory. On the one hand, soup became homogenous (though pretty tasty), portable, and very cheap. On the other, the soup-makers were made, as Marx might have put it, into appendages of soup-making machines. Management tried to make production lean and keep profits high; labor tried to keep work safe and wages high. But in the end, the two couldn&#8217;t make ends meet, at least in Camden: Campbell moved its production out of NJ in the 1980s. Not an unfamiliar story, I think, but still a very important one to tell and re-tell.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>You&#8217;ve probably heard of the &#8220;Age of Exploration.&#8221; You know, Henry the Navigator, Vasco da Gama, Columbus, etc., etc. But actually that was the European Age of Exploration (and really it wasn&#8217;t even that, because the people who lived in what we now call &#8220;Europe&#8221; didn&#8217;t think of themselves as &#8220;Europeans&#8221; in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, but no matter&#8230;). There were, however, other Ages of Exploration.
Giancarlo Casale&#8216;s wonderful book is about one of them, one you haven&#8217;t heard of. It&#8217;s called, appropriately enough, The Ottoman Age of Exploration (Oxford UP, 2010) and is about&#8211;you guessed it&#8211;the Ottoman Age of Exploration. Like their &#8220;European&#8221; counterparts, the Ottoman explorers were pursuing two interests: spices and salvation. The former were found (largely) in Southern Asia and the latter was of course in Mecca. To ensure access to both, the Ottomans built&#8211;nearly from scratch&#8211;an large, ocean-going navy and set out to dominate the Indian Ocean. And they almost did it, though they faced fierce competition from the Portuguese, Safavids, and Mughals. Read all about it in Casale&#8217;s terrific book.

		<itunes:summary>It&#8217;s pretty common in American political discourse to call someone a &#8220;fascist.&#8221; Everyone knows, however, that this is just name-calling: supposed fascists are never really fascists&#8211;they are just people you don&#8217;t like very much. Not so in post-War West Germany. There, too, it was common to call people &#8220;fascists. But in the Federal Republic they may well have been fascists, that is, Nazis. Despite the efforts of the most thorough-going de-Nazifiers, post-war West German government, business and society was shot through with ex-Nazis. Young people, and especially university students in the BRD, were keenly aware of this fact, and they wondered how it could be that the so-called &#8220;Auschwitz generation&#8221; could have changed their tune so quickly. Under the influence of some rather clever left-leaning philosophers (those of the Frankfurt School), some of them came to the conclusion that they hadn&#8217;t and that, therefore, Germany was still a fascist state. This conclusion (erroneous as it was) gave them striking moral clarity: there was only one thing to do when faced with fascism&#8211;resist it by any means necessary. And that is what they did. 
In his enlightening Utopia or Auschwitz: Germany&#8217;s 1968 Generation and the Holocaust (Columbia UP, 2010), veteran journalist and policy analyst Hans Kundnani tells their story. It&#8217;s somewhere between a farce and a tragedy, at least in my reading. On the one hand, to think that West Germany was a fascist state, to classify Zionism as a kind of Nazism, and to believe that the leftist students were persecuted &#8220;new Jews&#8221; is of course absurd. At least some of the West German radicals were so out of touch with reality that it defies understanding. On the other hand, they were in fact surrounded by ex-fascists, keenly aware that Israel was (to put it delicately) &#8220;asserting itself&#8221; in the middle east, and constantly on the run from Federal authorities. In such a situation I might lose touch with reality too. For the terrorists, who never regained their senses, it all ended badly. But for those whose heads cleared (Joschka Fisher, for example), it ended in power, though a different power than they had imagined in 1968.

		<itunes:summary>I remember clearly the day I was offered my first credit card. It was in Berkeley, CA in 1985. I was walking on Sproul Plaza and I saw a booth manned by two students. They were giving out all kinds of swag, so I walked over to see what was to be had. T-shirts, I think. I asked them if I could get a credit card, sure that the answer had to be &#8220;no.&#8221; But the answer was an enthusiastic &#8220;yes.&#8221; I asked them if they understood that: a) I had no income beyond a tiny graduate student stipend; b) that I was carrying a debt from college that had been kindly &#8220;deferred&#8221;; and c) that my long-term prospects, money-making wise, were poor (the market in early Russian history degrees not being very hot). They said they didn&#8217;t know any of that, but it didn&#8217;t matter. All I had to do was to fill out a form and the card would arrive in the mail. I declined. 
As Louis Hyman tells us in his excellent and important Debtor Nation: The History of America in Red Ink (Princeton UP, 2011), it wasn&#8217;t always so. Before the 1920s, most people could get no credit at all, least of all from a financial institution. But then, thanks to a confluence of odd interests, consumer credit expanded mightily. Companies that made expensive stuff (cars) and companies that handled large pools of idle money (banks) found, much to their surprise that if you lent ordinary folks large sums of money at moderate interest, they would pay it back. The producers and banks lent more; consumers borrowed and bought more; and, in turn, the producers and banks used higher profits to increase productivity, putting still more money in the pockets of consumers. And so the cycle continued, ultimately fostering the largest expansion in production and consumption the world had ever seen. Whether it will continue is a subject of some dispute today. </itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Sometimes a shallow explanation, the kind you read in newspapers and hear on television, is enough. &#8220;The home team was beaten at the buzzer&#8221; is probably all you need to know. Sometimes, however, it&#8217;s not. The intermittent conflict between the Shias and Sunnis in Iraq (and elsewhere) provides a good example. It is just not sufficient to say, as the major news outlets often do, that the Shias are fighting the Sunnis in Iraq because the Shias were oppressed by the Sunnis under Saddam Hussein, a Sunni. If this is all you understand about the conflict, you do not understand it. And you need to understand it.
To even begin to comprehend the Sunni-Shia conflict, you need to know how, out of one revelation, Islam broke into two major parts; how, in the course of time, multi-national empires integrated those parts under one ostensibly pan-Muslim writ; how European imperialist broke up those empires, with their Shia and Sunni parts, and out of them made &#8220;nation states&#8221; where there were no nations; how Arab nationalists attempted to remake these faux-nations and their Shia and Sunni parts along &#8220;international socialist&#8221; lines; how radical Islamists, fed up with the aforementioned Arab nationalists, launched a fundamentalist revolt within Islam; how one such group, having decided, bizarrely, that the United States was somehow at fault for the oppression of Muslim &#8220;true believers&#8221; in the Middle East, murdered 3000 innocent people (from all over the world and of all confessions, it should be said) on September 11, 2001; how, in response, the president and the congress of the United States ordered the invasion of two Middle Eastern states believed to have suborned the attack and international terrorism more generally; how those invasions, and the complete breakdown of law and order that followed them, provided an opportunity for Sunni and Shia militants to settle very old scores in what the Western press blandly calls a &#8220;sectarian conflict.&#8221;
This is not a tale anyone can tell in a headline or even 500 words. So if you want to grasp the &#8220;whys&#8221; of the Sunni-Shia struggle, you need to look beyond The New York Times. Lesley Hazleton&#8217;s marvelous After the Prophet: the Epic Story of the Shia-Sunni Split (Doubleday, 2009) is an excellent place to start. In terms of historical trade-craft, Hazleton has done something quite remarkable: she&#8217;s told a complicated story in writerly, yet concise way. You won&#8217;t get lost (though the cast of characters is long) and you won&#8217;t tire (though the tale stretches over centuries). Moreover, the book is written with great understanding and sympathy. Hazleton allows us to share the feeling of frustration (and worse) that the early followers of the Prophet felt as they tried to work out what Islam would be in his absence. In so doing, she gives us a sense of their frustration (and worse) as they continue to do so in places like Iraq.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Reading J. E. Lendon&#8217;s writerly Song of Wrath: The Peloponnesian War Begins (Basic Books, 2010) took me back to the eventful days of my youth at Price Elementary School, or rather to the large yard on which we had recess. We called it a &#8220;playground.&#8221; But we did not play on it. We did battle.
We did not fight for treats or for love or for sport. These things were trivial to us. No, we fought for honor. One achieved honor not by getting good grades, or by having the best lunch, or by making the most friends. Everyone knew that these things were the spoils of honor, not the causes of it. Rather, one gained honor by physical intimidation and, if necessary, combat. Honor was fair: it paid regard to neither sex, nor race, nor class. Girls and boys, blacks and whites, rich and poor could all have whatever honor they could earn. But honor was also brutal: the strong and brave (or should we say &#8220;reckless&#8221;) usually had it, while the weak and timid (or should we say &#8220;sensible&#8221;) usually did not. Interestingly, the former did not &#8220;bully&#8221; the latter very often. At least at Price Elementary School, humiliating a much weaker opponent was considered, somehow, dishonorable. But among the strong and brave there were constant contests of honor, often violent. The &#8220;hegemons,&#8221; if we may so speak, enjoyed high honor. But they also suffered from constant fear that they might lose it. And so anxious class champions would challenge one another, fight, and the victor would humiliate the vanquished (&#8220;Say &#8216;uncle&#8217;!&#8221;). For the defeated party, eager to regain his or her honor, there was only one honorable course: revenge&#8211;swift, ruthless, and public.
So it went, day in and day out on the &#8220;playground&#8221; at Price Elementary School.  And so it went, year in and year out, on the battlefields of fifth-century Greece.

		<itunes:summary>Most Americans could tell you who George Washington&#8217;s wife was. (Martha, right?) Most Americans probably couldn&#8217;t tell you who Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s wife was. (It was also Martha, but a different one of course). They might be able to tell you, however, who Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s alleged concubine was, as she has been in the news a lot lately. (His slave, Sally Hemings). But actually there were a lot of women in Jefferson&#8217;s life&#8211;or should we say a lot of women had Jefferson in their lives. 
Virginia Scharff tells us about the most important of them (including Martha and Sally) in her literary-yet-historical new book The Women Jefferson Loved (HarperCollins, 2010). The &#8220;Jefferson Women,&#8221; if it may be allowed, were an interesting bunch. They were sturdy, intelligent, and sometimes rich. Jefferson did love them, but he didn&#8217;t really think they were the equals of men. He was hardly alone in this opinion. Even children of the Enlightenment like Jefferson felt God had made women for a distinctly womenly role, and Jefferson felt it was his duty to make sure they played it. Suffice it to say that they were pregnant a lot and became very good at managing domestic life on a plantation. That, of course, is nothing to discount, for in so doing they created the domestic and emotional context within which Jefferson lived.  They were an important part of his world, and he of theirs. Thanks to Virginia for bringing this world alive for us. </itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Today everybody wants to be a capitalist, even Chinese communists. It would be easy to think, then, that capitalism is &#8220;natural,&#8221; that there is a little profit-seeker in each one of us just waiting to pop out. There is some truth to this notion: humans are the most cooperative species on earth, and one of the most common ways we cooperate is through trade. Some form of &#8220;you scratch my back and I&#8217;ll scratch yours&#8221; lies at the heart of almost every human relationship. We are built for reciprocation, and we do it remarkably well.
But, as Joyce Appleby shows in her provocative, readable, and thoroughly entertaining The Relentless Revolution: A History of Capitalism (Norton, 2010), the natural impulse for reciprocal back-scratching did not capitalism make. A set of very unusual historical forces did. These historical forces were not everywhere and always. On the contrary, they came together in one place at one time: Northwestern Europe in what we might call the &#8220;long modern period,&#8221; roughly the 15th though 18th centuries. Of course people in other places and other times traded, and even traded a lot. But they did not develop the culture of capitalism, that is, a set of values that suggested making money was good not only for the money-maker but for everyone else. Alexander Pope, one of the early apologists of capitalism, put the capitalist ethic this way: &#8220;Thus God and Nature link&#8217;d the gen&#8217;ral frame, and bade self-love and social be the same.&#8221; (An Essay on Man, 1733) Gordon Gekko, in the (anti-capitalist) film Wall Street (1987), put it more crudely: &#8220;Greed&#8230;is good.&#8221; Neither, it should be said, did pre-capitalist traders develop the institutions that make capitalism operate, that is, things like investment banks, credits, stock markets, insurance, and a whole host of government regulations (yes, government regulations) without which &#8220;free trade&#8221; could not be &#8220;free&#8221; at all. Caesar was not concerned about in the federal reserve. He didn&#8217;t even have a federal reserve to be concerned about. 
All of which leads to a single and startling conclusion: the culture and institutions of capitalism are Western. Thus when we in the West promote capitalism as the &#8220;best&#8221; way of going about things economic, we are engaging in a subtle form of cross-cultural persuasion. We may be right, capitalism may indeed be the best way to provision goods and services to the masses (I think it obviously is). But that doesn&#8217;t make capitalist culture any the less foreign to most of the world.

		<itunes:summary>The term &#8220;totalitarian&#8221; is useful as it well describes the aspirations of polities such as Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union (at least under Stalin). Yet it can also be misleading, for it suggests that totalitarian ambitions were in fact achieved. But they were not, as we can see in Catherine Epstein&#8217;s remarkably detailed, thoroughly researched, and clearly presented Model Nazi: Arthur Greiser and the Occupation of Western Poland (Oxford UP, 2010). 
Greiser was a totalitarian if ever there were one. He believed in the Nazi cause with his heart and soul. He wanted to create a new Germany, and indeed a new Europe dominated by Germans. As the Gauleiter of Wartheland (an area of Western Poland annexed to the Reich), he was given the opportunity to help realize the Nazi nightmare in the conquered Eastern territories. But, as Epstein shows, he was often hindered both by his own personality and the chaos that characterized Nazi occupation of the East. Grieser emerges from Epstein&#8217;s book as someone who wanted to be a &#8220;model Nazi,&#8221; but couldn&#8217;t really manage it because he was a crooked timber working in a crooked system. His personal life was an embarrassing tangle of marriages, affairs, and break-ups that at points threatened his career. His professional life was marked by ambition, ego-mania, and fawning, none of which endeared him to most of his colleagues and superiors. And his murderous attempts to &#8220;work toward the Führer&#8221; in the Wartheland&#8211;by displacing Poles, murdering Jews and other &#8220;undesirables,&#8221; and populating the East with Germans&#8211;were stymied by the cross-cutting jurisdictions, conflicting agendas, and professional jealousies that were one of the hallmarks of Nazi rule. Grieser did his best (or his worst, depending on how you look at it) to Germanize the Wartheland. He improvised, maneuvered, and &#8220;worked the system&#8221; such as it was in pursuit of the Nazi totalitarian project. Thankfully, he failed, demonstrating again that totalitarian dreams, though they can be horribly distructive, are a far reach from totalitarian realities. </itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>I have three cats. They have names (Fatty, Mini, and Koshka). They live in my house. I feed them, take them to the vet, and love them. When they die, I&#8217;ll be really sad. After having read Joyce Salisbury&#8217;s eye-opening The Beast Within: Animals in the Middle Ages (Routledge, 2011), I know now how weird all that is. 
People in the Middle Ages did not, so far as we know, love their animals. As Joyce points out, they used them, ate them, and even had sex with them. But they do not seem to have loved them, any of them. They did, or at least some of them, think about animals rather deeply. They wanted to know what animals were, really. They knew animals were God&#8217;s creatures. But there were nettlesome questions, like whether animals had souls. Well, probably not. Some of them, however, like lambs, were put forward as models for holy behavior (&#8220;the Lamb of God&#8221;). So do lambs, unlike all other animals, have souls? Another question: Could you eat animals? If they didn&#8217;t have souls, then you certainly could. But which ones? Not clear. The Christian Bible&#8211;unlike the Hebrew Bible&#8211;is rather short on dietary regulations. Yet another question: Could you have sex with animals? They were, after all, only things, and it didn&#8217;t really matter what you did with things (though &#8220;spilling your seed&#8221; in any case was a no-no). That said, having sex with an animal is rather unseemly. Still another question: If an animal killed someone, was it &#8220;guilty.&#8221; Aristotle said animals didn&#8217;t have reason, so that would suggest that animals couldn&#8217;t be &#8220;guilty&#8221; or &#8220;innocent.&#8221; Fine, but some animals were awfully smart, like the sly fox that everyone heard about in folk tales. So if some animals have some reason and are therefore human-like, are there some humans who are a touch bestial and therefore animal-like? Where exactly was the line between humans and animals? Thinkers of the Middle Ages had some interesting things to say about all these questions, many of which still have resonance today. Read Joyce&#8217;s fine book and learn all about it.

		<itunes:summary>We in the West tend to classify people by the color of their skin, or what we casually call &#8220;race.&#8221; But, as Nell Irvin Painter shows in her fascinating new book The History of White People (Norton, 2010), it wasn&#8217;t always so. The Greeks didn&#8217;t do it, at least very seriously. The Romans didn&#8217;t do it, at least very often. And the folks of the Middle Ages didn&#8217;t do it, at least with much gusto. In fact, the people who invented the modern concept of &#8220;race&#8221; and the classification of people by skin color were Europeans and Americans of the Enlightenment and Romantic Era. 
Why then and there? As Painter points out, a number of historical trends coincided to produced &#8220;racial science&#8221; and its child &#8220;whiteness&#8221; in Europe and North America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. These trends included: the &#8220;discovery&#8221; of New Worlds (and the people in them) in the Americas, Asia, and Africa; the evolution of the African slave trade and with it the historically novel identification of &#8220;negroes&#8221; with slavery; the birth of proto-anthoropology and with its ancillary sciences (e.g.,  &#8220;craniometry&#8221;); nationalism, and desire of nationalists (especially Germans) to discover the intrinsic &#8220;greatness&#8221; of particular nations (notably theirs); the massive influx of &#8220;undesirable&#8221; Irish and Eastern Europeans into the United States; and the &#8220;progressive&#8221; idea that human populations could be bred for &#8220;superior traits,&#8221; that is, eugenics. All these things forced European and American elites to think hard about what kind of people they were.
The conclusion they reached was that they were (variously) &#8220;Anglo Saxons,&#8221;  &#8220;Nordics,&#8221; &#8220;Aryans&#8221; and eventually just &#8220;Whites.&#8221; That they believed themselves to be superior to all other &#8220;races&#8221; should not surprise us (humans being naturally prideful). But the muddle-headed quality of their thought on matters racial should raise some eyebrows, for these people were not dumb. They were, however, afraid, and fear often drives even well-intentioned, intelligent people to say foolish things. This they certainly did. Alas, some people still do. They should read Nell Painter&#8217;s fine book.

		<itunes:summary>You&#8217;ve probably read about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It&#8217;s the largest (17 miles around!), most expensive (9 billion dollars!) scientific instrument in history. What&#8217;s it do? It accelerates beams of tiny particles (protons) to nearly the speed of light and then smashes them into one another. That&#8217;s cool, you say, but why? Well, the simple answer is this: it was built to test the validity of the way most physicists understand the origins and essence of everything, that is, the &#8220;standard model.&#8221;
You see, the standard model has a big gap in it: it can&#8217;t explain why certain essential particles have mass. In the 1960s, however, a group of theoretical physicists proposed an answer. These massive particles, they said, were bathed in a dense, universal field of other particles, now called &#8220;Higgs bosons.&#8221; The field gives them mass. To draw an analogy (always a dangerous thing to do in physics&#8230;), particles like protons have mass for the same reason straws stand up in milkshakes&#8211;they are &#8220;packed in,&#8221; so to say. The trouble, to continue this awkward analogy, is that no one has ever &#8220;seen&#8221; the milkshake. The scientists working at the LHC are trying to find it. If they do, the standard model remains standard and Nobel Prizes all &#8217;round. If not, well, back to the drawing board.
Ian Sample does a masterful job of telling the tale of the quest for the Higgs boson (aka the &#8220;God particle&#8221;) in his new book  Massive: The Missing Particle that Sparked the Greatest Hunt in Science (Basic Books, 2010). You don&#8217;t need to know a thing about physics (though the author clearly does) to enjoy it. Sample has a talent for explaining things that are often obscured by mathematics (a kind of crutch, I think, for many scientists) in straightforward English prose. This skill, combined with the fact that Sample is a great storyteller with a great story to tell, make Massive an excellent read. You may not have liked science in school, but trust me when I say you&#8217;ll very much enjoy the history of science in the hands of Ian Sample.

		<itunes:summary>What should we study? The eighteenth-century luminary and poet Alexander Pope had this to say on the subject: &#8220;Know then thyself, presume not God to scan; The proper study of mankind is man &#8221; (An Essay on Man, 1733).  He was not alone in this opinion. The philosophers of the Enlightenment&#8211;of which we may count Pope&#8211;all believed that humans would benefit most from a proper comprehension of temporal things, and most particularly humanity itself. For them, understanding humanity meant, first and foremost, understanding the human body. Naturally, then, the philosophes and their successors paid close attention to the body. They cut it up, took it apart, measured it and attempted to see how it worked. They were most interested in one part in particular&#8211;the human head. It was the seat of the human characteristic the Enlightenment scientists admired most: intelligence. If one could get a handle on the human cranium, then one would understand what it meant to be human. Or at least so they thought. 
In her fascinating new book The Skull Collectors: Race, Science and America&#8217;s Unburied Dead (University of Chicago Press, 2010), Ann Fabian introduces us to a group of American philosophes who began to collect and study human crania in the first half of the nineteenth century. Not surprisingly, they took most of their cues from their European counterparts. They did, however, adapt craniology to a peculiar American context. Living in a social order in part built on supposed racial difference, the American skull collectors knew that what they said about Africans mattered. Their work could support the suppositions of slavery, or not. Moreover, living in a social order that was at the very time they were working involved in a quasi-genocidal campaign against indigenous peoples, the American skull collectors knew that what they said about Native Americans mattered as well. Their work might buttress the movement for Indian removal, or it might not. And being people of the &#8220;New World,&#8221; the American skull collectors knew that they were looked down upon by many of their European colleagues. They needed to collect skulls aggressively in order to establish craniology as an American science. 
As one might expect, the American skull collectors were, by our lights, a strange bunch. Racists, imperialists, and nationalists to be sure. But also scientists, curators, and founders of physical anthropology. Thanks to Ann for bringing them to us in all their contradictory richness.

		<itunes:summary>The question as to why the leaders of the Soviet Union murdered hundreds of thousands of Soviet citizens during the Great Purges is one of the most important of modern history, primarily because it shapes what we are likely to think about communism. There are two schools of thought. On the one hand, there are those who feel Stalin launched the Great Purges because &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; was (and is) intrinsic to communist ideology and practice. On this gloss, communism itself is responsible for Stalin&#8217;s bloodletting. On the other hand, there are those who hold that Stalin launched the Great Purges in response to a momentary crisis, or perceived crisis, that had little to do with building communism per se. On this understanding, Stalin and his colleagues believed that the destruction of the Soviet Union, either by internal or external enemies, was an imminent possibility. Thus they felt they had to act, and act decisively.
By the mid-1930s, all the top Bolsheviks were truly frightened. They thought the end might well be nigh, and they knew that something had to be done about it.
Who&#8217;s right?  In his path-breaking Policing Stalin&#8217;s Socialism: Repression and Social Order in the Soviet Union, 1924-1953 (Yale UP, 2010) David Shearer offers the most nuanced answer yet. He argues that the Bolsheviks believed class war was an essential and unavoidable part of building communism. The logic here is simple: if you are going to build a classless society, you have to destroy existing classes. This is precisely what the Bolsheviks did, and said they were doing, during the mass repression campaigns&#8211;especially de-kulakization&#8211;of the late 1920s and early 1930s. The Great Purges, however, were different. Here Stalin was not building communism via class war, but preparing the Soviet Union for what he believed would be a decisive battle with capitalist states without and &#8220;socially harmful elements&#8221; within. By the mid-1930s, all the top Bolsheviks were truly frightened. They thought the end might well be nigh, and they knew that something had to be done about it. In desperation (delusional though it may have been), they used the police organs developed during the the period of class war (the NKVD, the GUGB) to root out any potential opponents of the regime. Who were they? Basically anyone who had run afoul of the law or was a member of a suspect political class or ethnic group. Stalin ordered the police to tally these &#8220;socially harmful elements&#8221; and transmit the results to Moscow. On the basis of the tallies, Stalin issued arrest quotas and commanded that they be filled and over-fulfilled. The Great Purges began.

And then, after roughly 17 months, they stopped. The Germans invaded, were defeated, and the Bolsheviks set about rebuilding the country. The repression continued during this period, but, as Shearer shows, it was different from what had come immediately before. The political police were no longer rounding up masses of potential counter-revolutionaries (except in the newly occupied territories such as the Baltic States, Eastern Poland, and Western Ukraine; there class war and social cleansing still had to be undertaken). Instead, the civil police arrested and exiled hundreds of thousands because they had abused socialist propriety by pilfering food, refusing to work, or committing one or another crime.
What Shearer demonstrates is that while Soviet communism was inherently oppressive, it was not inherently murderous. Communism did not uniquely cause the Great Purges; Stalin&#8217;s paranoia and power did.

		<itunes:summary>Here&#8217;s something interesting. If you search Google Books for &#8220;Hitler,&#8221; you&#8217;ll get 3,090,000 results.  What&#8217;s that mean? Well, it means that more scholarly attention has probably been paid to Hitler than any other figure in modern history. Napoleon, Lincoln, Lenin and a few others might give him a run for his money, but I&#8217;d bet on Hitler. The fact that so much effort has been expended on Hitler presents modern German historians with a problem: it&#8217;s hard to say anything new about him.
The fact that so much effort has been expended on Hitler presents modern German historians with a problem: it&#8217;s hard to say anything new about him.
Surely Thomas Weber knew this when he began to work on Hitler&#8217;s First War: Adolf Hitler, the Men of the List Regiment, and the First World War (Oxford UP, 2010). After all, a new book on Hitler&#8217;s wartime experience had come out in 2005. What more is there to say? It turns out that there is quite a lot if you know where to look. And Weber does. He uses an interesting approach to uncover novel information about Hitler. Weber acknowledges that the documentary record relating directly to Hitler&#8217;s personal wartime experience is thin (a few letters, some military reports) and, when it is thicker, biased (more than a few axe-grinding memoirs from a much later time). These documents, all of which have been pored over by historians, will not shed any new light on Hitler. So Weber turns to a much larger and more trustworthy body of sources: that produced by the officers and soldiers in Hitler&#8217;s unit, the List Regiment. Though these papers usually do not mention Hitler by name, they enable Weber to reconstruct what he must have experienced, to see what was typical and what was not in Hitler&#8217;s service record, and, on the basis of this information, judge the veracity of claims made by Hitler, Nazi propagandists, and historians about the impact of World War I on the the Nazi dictator.

The result is a serious revision. Hitler (et al.) said that World War one &#8220;made&#8221; him the person he became. Weber shows in detail that this claim is false. Fundamental elements of Hitler&#8217;s worldview either pre-date the war (his German nationalism) or seem to post-date it (his radical anti-semitism). In fact, the war did two things for Hitler: it gave him credibility he could use as he entered politics and it convinced him that he was an expert in military affairs. He ran for office as a humble Gefreiter (private), a holder of the Iron Cross First Class; and he ran the war as a dilettantish know-it-all, often with disastrous consequences.
The only revelation Hitler had in the trenches was a common one, namely, that war is a very nasty business. That he went on to start another, even bloodier one has less to do with his experience of World War One than the ideas he brought to the conflict and absorbed after it.

		<itunes:summary>Here&#8217;s something remarkable: at some point in the future, something you believe to be just fine will be utterly disdained by the greater part of humanity. For instance, it is at least imaginable that one day everyone will believe that zoos were [NB] profoundly immoral. The future will condemn us for imprisoning animals. The future will ask &#8220;How could they have done such a barbaric thing?&#8221; And the future, more than likely, will answer &#8220;Because they were evil.&#8221; When looking into humanity&#8217;s sordid past, we often say this sort of thing. Why did American slaveholders trade in human flesh? Because they were evil. Why did the Nazis persecute the Jews? Because they were evil. Why did the Khmer Rough murder countless innocent Cambodians? Because they were evil.
In 1940, Mochulsky was tapped by the NKVD (it ran the GULAG system) to build railroads north of the Arctic Circle. He thereby came to control the lives of a great number of what were essentially slave-laborers. He, of course, did not see them as such.
&#8220;Because they were evil,&#8221; however, is not an explanation; it&#8217;s an ethical judgment. It might make you feel morally superior; and indeed you might well be morally superior. But it will not help you comprehend anything. For if you really want to understand why seemingly ordinary people did what you feel are truly awful things, you have to listen to them explain why. In Gulag Boss: A Soviet Memoir (Oxford UP, 2010), Deborah Kaple gives us just this opportunity. She presents us with Fyodor Vasilevich Mochulsky&#8211;ordinary fellow, Communist Party member, and GULAG officer from 1940 to 1946.

Born in Belorussia after the Revolution, Mochulsky was raised on Bolshevik ideas. Not surprisingly, he believed in the project; he wanted to help create a bright future for humankind. So he trained as an engineer, because building socialism was all about building in those days. In 1940, Mochulsky was tapped by the NKVD (it ran the GULAG system) to build railroads north of the Arctic Circle. He thereby came to control the lives of a great number of what were essentially slave-laborers. He, of course, did not see them as such. To him, they were &#8220;enemies of the people&#8221; and had received their just (if somewhat harsh) reward. Under his direction, many of them suffered and died. This bothered him a bit, but not enough to question &#8220;the system.&#8221; He thought it was basically sound, though perhaps in need of better implementation. And that is the way he saw his role: he was improving &#8220;the system&#8221; without ever asking whether &#8220;the system&#8221; itself was bankrupt. Of course, looking back on what he did (he wrote the memoir in the 1990s), he has regrets. But he had none at the time. Mochulsky believed in what he was doing, just the way you believe that it&#8217;s fine to imprison animals.

		<itunes:summary>I&#8217;ll tell you something I&#8217;ve never really understood: the difference between &#8220;art&#8221; and &#8220;craft.&#8221; Yes, I get the sociological difference (&#8220;art&#8221; is made in New York and Paris; &#8220;craft&#8221; is made in Omaha and Wichita), but what about the substantive difference? One common way to differentiate the two is to say &#8220;art&#8221; is not functional and &#8220;craft&#8221; is functional. You can&#8217;t sit on a painting but you can sit on a chair. If that&#8217;s the difference, then the &#8220;Museum of Modern Art&#8221; in New York should be called the &#8220;Museum of Modern Art and Craft,&#8221; because it&#8217;s full of (not very comfortable) furniture. I also cannot really comprehend the difference between &#8220;insider art&#8221; and &#8220;outsider art.&#8221; Again, I get the sociological distinction (see above), but who gets to say who&#8217;s inside and who&#8217;s outside? And if there&#8217;s &#8220;insider art&#8221; and &#8220;outsider art,&#8221; is there &#8220;insider craft&#8221; and &#8220;outsider craft?&#8221;
In the world of quilting (which is much bigger than you think), Powers is a bit like Vermeer: not many pieces, but all highly valued. And like Vermeer, she&#8217;s interesting because we don&#8217;t know a lot about her.
All I know is this: there was a freed slave named Harriet Powers who made really beautiful, highly literate, and deeply religious quilts. In the world of quilting (which is much bigger than you think), Powers is a bit like Vermeer: not many pieces, but all highly valued. And like Vermeer, she&#8217;s interesting because we don&#8217;t know a lot about her. In This I Accomplish: Harriet Powers&#8217; Bible Quilt and Other Pieces (2010), Kyra Hicks does her best to fill in the many blanks. The book is a combination detective story, journey of discovery, and guide to further research. Hicks, a master quilter herself, doggedly pursues every lead she can find regarding the mysterious Powers, and they take her to some very unexpected places (for example, Keokuk, Iowa). The picture of Powers that emerges from This I Accomplish is that of a skilled, religiously-inspired artist, confident and proud of her work, moving through a long-forgotten world of African American quilters.

If you know any quilters (and I know you do), this book would make an excellent gift. If you&#8217;d like to see Powers&#8217; quilts for yourself, they are held by the National Museum of American History (part of the Smithsonian) in Washington and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.

		<itunes:summary>In Cry Havoc: How the Arms Race Drove the World to War, 1931–1941 (Basic Books, 2010), Joe Maiolo proposes (I want to write &#8220;demonstrates,&#8221; but please read the book and judge for yourself) two remarkably insightful theses.
The military industrial complex was born three decades before Eisenhower put a name on it.
The first is that the primary result of the disaster that was World War I was not the even great catastrophe that was World War II, but rather a new kind of state and one that is still with us. Maiolo&#8217;s argument goes something like this. World War I caught the Great Powers flatfooted. They did not believe they were going to fight a protracted war; they thought things would be done quickly and with the men and materiel on hand. Instead, things bogged down and a massive war of attrition&#8211;something they had no experience with&#8211;ensued. In order to fight this war successfully (meaning to stay in it for the long term), the Great Powers had to fundamentally restructure their economies, something no state had ever had to do, at least in modern time. In a word, the government took over production and distribution in order to optimize the flow of arms and supplies. Many statesmen found this move objectionable, but all believed it necessary. Once the war was over, they remained convinced that the only way to deter their enemies and, in the case they couldn&#8217;t, fend them off, was to retain control of large segments of the economy and plan to take control of even larger segments. The ability to make war on a World-War-I scale and for a World-War-I duration had to be built into the &#8220;plan.&#8221; Thus the leaders of all the Great Powers effectively militarized their economies in anticipation of the next great conflict. The military industrial complex was born three decades before Eisenhower put a name on it.

Maiolo&#8217;s second insight has to do with the origins of World War II itself. Most historians agree that it was &#8220;Hitler&#8217;s War.&#8221; He planned it, he armed Germany for it, and he started it. Maiolo doesn&#8217;t necessarily disagree with this position, but he offers an interesting counter-factual that puts it in a different light. What if there had been no Hitler? Would the statesmen of Europe have avoided a second great conflict? Maiolo suggests not, and for an interesting reason. Several of the Great Powers&#8211;the Soviets and Germans in particular&#8211;were very dissatisfied with the settlement at Versailles. They would not stand pat in any case. Given what we know about Soviet and German plans for and movements toward rearmament before 1933 (thanks, it should be said, to Maiolo&#8217;s own research), it is not clear that leaders other Stalin or Hitler might not have done exactly what Stalin and Hitler did in 1939, that is, take what they felt was rightfully &#8220;theirs&#8221; by force of arms. And as Maiolo shows, they would have had plenty of arms at their disposal in any case. The Europeans were going to go at again; it was simply a question of when.

		<itunes:summary>I think that many smart people, particularly on the Left, make a really ill-considered assumption, to wit, that &#8220;Republican&#8221; means &#8220;Conservative.&#8221; I don&#8217;t mean lower case &#8220;c&#8221; conservative, as in wanting to maintain the status quo. Nearly all (there are important exceptions) twentieth-century Republicans were conservatives in that generic sense. Rather, I mean capital &#8220;c&#8221; conservative, that is, pro-religion, traditional family centered, militarily hawkish, arch-patriotic, Constitution protecting, States rights shielding, free enterprise loving, individual responsibility promoting, values matter Conservative. It was only in the 1980s that a goodly number of Republicans endorsed this set of beliefs.
They were believers, it&#8217;s just that they believed things that most members of the East Coast commentariat (at least before the rise of Limbaugh, et al.) did not. From the results of the recent mid-term elections in the United States, I think it&#8217;s fair to say they still don&#8217;t.
In his wonderfully written, witty, and engaging book The Rise and Fall of Modern American Conservatism (Princeton UP, 2010),  David Farber tells the story of how Conservatives took over the Republican Party and reshaped American politics. He does so using a devise that I find particularly appropriate for any story of political change, namely, through the lives of the people who founded, grew, and led the movement. Farber, who clearly believes that leadership matters a great deal in democratic politics (I couldn&#8217;t agree more), has a talent for linking biography to political history. Farber&#8217;s sketches of Robert Taft, William Buckley, Barry Goldwater, Phyllis Schlafly, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush show us the degree to which their personalities shaped the rise (and fall) of American Conservatism. Each vignette is a pleasure to read and full of enlightening and entertaining observations. And though Farber pulls no punches (he does not shrink, for example, from calling a liar a liar), it&#8217;s clear that he respects his subjects and suggests that we should respect them too. In his estimation (and mine as well), they were not the collection of benighted, fearful, blinkered, country-bumpkin bigots that you can read about in The Nation. They were believers, it&#8217;s just that they believed things that most members of the East Coast commentariat (at least before the rise of Limbaugh, et al.) did not. From the results of the recent mid-term elections in the United States, I think it&#8217;s fair to say they still don&#8217;t.

		<itunes:summary>I fear that most people think that &#8220;history&#8221; is &#8220;the past&#8221; and that the one and the other live in books. But it just ain&#8217;t so. History is a story we tell about the past, or rather some small portion of it. The past itself is gone and cannot, outside science fiction, be revisited. And the histories in books are neither dead nor alive. They are zombies, endlessly repeating themselves, never having a new thought, never responding to anything you say. (Plato, by the way, is good on this subject.)  In point of fact the only place that histories really live is in the minds of historians in the act of creation. In this context, the story is far from dead. Indeed, it hasn&#8217;t even been born. As historians read, research, and think, they make histories like a carpenter makes a table. Readers rarely get to see the historical craftsmen at their benches. All they see is the result.
As historians read, research, and think, they make histories like a carpenter makes a table. Readers rarely get to see the historical craftsmen at their benches. All they see is the result.
Today we&#8217;ll have the opportunity to look into the history workshop with Abbott (&#8220;Tom&#8221;) Gleason. Tom has worked in academic history for nearly half a century. He has been everywhere, done everything, and faced every challenge a working historian can. And now he&#8217;s written a terrific memoir about his path, and that of historians of his generation in general: A Liberal Education (TidePool Press, 2010). I came away from the book with a renewed appreciation of the hold Zeitgeist has on historians and their work. Tom was raised in a cultural milieu (the liberal WASP establishment) that has now largely vanished. That peculiar, specific context had a powerful impact (by his own admission, both positive and negative) on his historical opinions and writing. It was interesting for me to see how Tom, as a conflicted, thoughtful son of privilege, negotiated Harvard of the 1950s, academia in the 1960s, and the rise (and relative decline) of the Russian studies industry in the post war decades. With eyes wide open, he recognizes the limitations of his Cold-War scholarly cohort, the ways in which he and his colleagues saw some things while being oblivious to others. Sometimes they got Russia right; sometimes they didn&#8217;t. But they were always on a quest to find the historical truth. Tom&#8217;s memoir shows just how difficult that truth is to find.

		<itunes:summary>In the summer of 2008 the Chinese were worried about rain. They were set to host the Summer Olympics that year, and they wanted clear skies. Surely clear skies, they must have thought, would show the world that China had arrived. So they outfitted a small army (50,000 men) with artillery pieces and rocket launchers (over 10,000 of them) and proceeded to make war on the heavens. The idea was to &#8220;seed&#8221; clouds with silver iodide before they got to Beijing and rained on the Chinese parade. Or maybe the idea was to frighten the rain gods. Who knows? In any case, none of it worked: the massive, loud, and surely expensive operation had, according to most experts, no measurable effect on the weather around the Chinese capital.
You might say you can&#8217;t blame them for trying. But according to James Rodger Fleming, you can. In his incisive new book Fixing the Sky: The Checkered History of Weather and Climate Control (Columbia UP, 2010), Fleming shows that although people have always dreamed of controlling the weather, and many have tried to do so, no one has ever succeeded. The reason is simple: the atmosphere of the Earth is not like your refrigerator or oven. It&#8217;s just too big and complex to be man-handled by any known or even realistically imagined technology. But, as Fleming demonstrates, there are always desperate people who refuse to accept this intuitive fact. So we are presented with a gallery of rain-making mountebanks, charlatans, and swindlers ever-ready to part rain-seeking fools and their rain-seeking money. In Fleming&#8217;s excellent telling, the story is entertaining though a bit sad. It&#8217;s sadder still that the weather-controlling con is still being run by seemingly well-intentioned people who claim they can &#8220;fix&#8221; global warming by means of some out-sized, outrageous, and out-of-this-world engineering scheme.  Fleming, who both knows the science and has looked at the history, is more than dubious. The only way we can &#8220;fix&#8221; the sky is to leave it alone and hope for the best. It turns out, however, that leaving the sky alone is hard. It&#8217;s actually easier to attack it, proclaim victory, and continue as before. Just ask the Chinese.

		<itunes:summary>I imagine the guys who first faced Bill Russell felt like I did when I had to guard Antoine Carr in high school. I &#8220;held&#8221; Carr to 32 points. But no dunks! Russell&#8217;s opponents in college and the NBA rarely fared any better. Sports talk is full of hyperbole, but in Russell&#8217;s case most of it is true. In his time, he was far and away the best player to ever step on the court and, for most of his career, he completely owned every court he stepped on. He was so dominant that they changed the rules so less gifted players would have a chance.
Bill Russell, however, was not only a surpassingly great basketball player, he was also an African American star in an era in which being an African American star (or just being an African American) was very complicated. Today we are used to seeing outstandingly successful blacks in all (or almost all) spheres of life. In the mid-1950s that just wasn&#8217;t true. The American ruling elite was lily white, and that&#8217;s the way most white Americans thought it should be. Bill Russell (and Jackie Robinson, Althea Gibson, Willie Mays, Cassius Clay, Jim Brown, among others) were anomalies: they were black, but they were both extraordinarily accomplished and remarkably famous. They couldn&#8217;t just be athletes; they had to be symbols of some promising (or frightening) new world as well. That&#8217;s quite a burden to bear.
In King of the Court: Bill Russell and the Basketball Revolution (University of California Press, 2010), Aram Goudsouzian has done a great service by detailing the ways Russell bore this weight, and the ways in which he fought to throw it off. Aram makes clear that Russell was a conflicted soul. He lacked self-confidence, but he was brusk and even arrogant. He was friendly and gregarious to some, but often simply rude to others.  He was hot tempered, but he affected a cool, distant demeanor. He believed he was a man of principle (and convinced others he was), but he periodically abandoned his family for a playboy lifestyle. If Russell couldn&#8217;t be honest about himself, he insisted on being honest about everything and everyone around him. He meant what he said and said what he meant&#8211;about race, about sports, about anything that bothered him. He was a sort of athletic Socrates, always questioning and never fully accepting the way things were. And, like Socrates, Russell was willing to suffer for his beliefs. As Aram points out, he did in many ways. But in the process he gained the respect of almost everyone he encountered. He was a hard man to like, but he was an easy man to admire.

I should add that if you like white-hot game narratives, this book is full of them. Remember this?: &#8220;Greer is putting the ball in play. He gets it out deep and Havlicek steals it! Over to Sam Jones&#8230; Havlicek stole the ball! It&#8217;s all over&#8230; It&#8217;s all-l-l-l over!&#8221; Johnny Most, RIP.

		<itunes:summary>There&#8217;s a saying, sometimes attributed to Napoleon, &#8220;Scratch a Russian and you find a Tatar.&#8221; I&#8217;ve scratched a Russian (I won&#8217;t say anything more about that) and I can tell you that the saying is false: all I found was more Russian. It&#8217;s true, however, that Russians have always known a lot about Tatars because they&#8217;ve lived cheek-by-jowl with them for many centuries. Before the beginning of European contact with Russia in the sixteenth century, Russians didn&#8217;t really think the Tatars were terribly exotic. They were just neighbors, albeit occasionally hostile and profoundly heretical ones. The same could be said of the early modern Russian view of, say, Poles and Germans.
Things changed, however, when the Russians decided they weren&#8217;t just &#8220;Russians&#8221; but were also &#8220;Europeans.&#8221; That happened, roughly, in the eighteenth century. The Europeans, not being terribly experienced with the peoples of eastern climes, had some rather odd notions about the folks they often called &#8220;Orientals.&#8221; Over time, the Europhilic Russian elite began to assimilate the Europeans&#8217; views of &#8220;Orientals.&#8221; The process by which they did so, and the cultural consequences thereof, are the topic of David Schimmelpenninck van der Oye&#8216;s lucid, witty, and thought-provoking Russian Orientalism: Asia in the Russian Mind from Peter the Great to the Emigration (Yale UP, 2010). David explores how the Russians came to construct their own unique &#8220;Orient,&#8221; one that wasn&#8217;t exactly like the Western version and yet was clearly different from the thing itself. For unlike their imaginative European counterparts, the Russians&#8211;in my reading&#8211;could never really accept the Western image of &#8220;Orientals.&#8221; They knew the Tatars and other Asian peoples too well and could see that the Western view didn&#8217;t match. And then there was the needling suspicion that they themselves were &#8220;Orientals&#8221;. Thus Russian &#8220;Orientalism&#8221; was hardly the supposedly subtle yet powerful tool of pith-helmeted, empire-building, expansionists, but instead an attempt at self-understanding.

		<itunes:summary>My son Isaiah likes to play the &#8220;why&#8221; game. Isaiah: &#8220;Why is my ice cream gone?&#8221; Me: &#8220;Because you ate it.&#8221; Isaiah: &#8220;Why did I eat it?&#8221; Me: &#8220;Because you need food.&#8221; Isaiah: &#8220;Why do I need food?&#8221; And so on. Isaiah naturally wants to know why things are the way they are. We all do. Most of us, however, are taught that seeking these ultimate answers is quixotic. We say either that there are no ultimate answers or that you&#8217;d have to know too many to answer them. In this conception, there either is no story of everything or, if there is, no one can tell it.
Thankfully, Fred Spier disagrees. His path-breaking Big History and the Future of Humanity (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010) succeeds in sketching the story of everything from the origins of the universe to the reason my son&#8217;s ice cream is gone. In around two-hundred lucidly written pages he takes us from the Big Bang, to the separation of matter and energy, to the rise of elementary particles, to the formation of galaxies, solar systems, stars, and planets, to the creation of elements, to the origin of life, to the evolution of biotic complexity, to the emergence of humans, to the origin of society, to the invention of ice cream. What enables him to do this is a simple, unifying theory, namely, that all forms of complexity are the result of energy flowing through matter within certain boundaries (&#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; conditions). Everything with edges, a shape, parts, or an internal structure is the result of energy flowing through matter within certain boundaries and is only maintained so long as the energy keeps flowing and the boundaries don&#8217;t change.
Historiographically, this book takes us into new and promising territory. But even more than that it is timely, for the energy and conditions that maintain our complexity&#8211;that is, modern industrial life&#8211;are both in jeopardy. We consume much more energy than we produce, and the kind of energy we consume is moving us out of the Goldilocks zone. If unchecked, the result of these two processes is inevitable: a loss of complexity, which is to say the destruction of modern industrial society. That&#8217;s something to think about, and maybe even do something about.

		<itunes:summary>Absolutely no one doubts that Stalin murdered millions of people in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. His ruthless campaign of &#8220;dekulakization,&#8221; his pitiless deportation of &#8220;unreliable&#8221; ethnic groups, his senseless starvation of Ukrainian peasants, his cruel attempt to &#8220;cleanse&#8221; the Communist Party of supposed &#8220;enemies of the people&#8221;&#8211;all of these actions resulted in mass death. In total, Stalin is responsible for the murder of roughly 10 million Soviet citizens. Again, this is well established.
What is not well established is what to call Stalin&#8217;s crimes. As Norman Naimark points out in his thought-provoking Stalin&#8217;s Genocides (Princeton UP, 2010), historians and others have been peculiarly conflicted about this issue. Everyone agrees it&#8217;s mass murder. But is it &#8220;genocide,&#8221; with all that term entails? Etymologically, it doesn&#8217;t seem so: gens is Latin for &#8220;people who claim common descent,&#8221; that is, a clan, tribe, or even nation. The Kulaks were not a gens. Historically, genocide doesn&#8217;t fit well either: after World War II, the UN decided that it would mean &#8220;acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial religious group, as such.&#8221; Again, the Kulaks are none of these things.
Naimark, however, argues Stalin&#8217;s crimes should be considered genocide on three grounds. First, he demonstrates that some of Stalin&#8217;s attacks were genocide under the UN definition, for example his exile and starvation of minority ethnic groups. Second, he shows that some of those who sought to define genocide during and after World War II did not intend to restrict it to gens: they included political groups, that is, entities like the Kulaks. The Soviets and others demanded these groups be removed from the definition, and they were. Third, he demonstrates that international law has evolved, and with it the legal meaning of genocide: recent proceedings in the Baltic states, for example, have broadened the definition.

Some might ask &#8220;What does it matter what we call it?&#8221; I think it matters a lot. Words are not only an interpretation of the world, but they are also a reflection of who we are. The words the Nazis used to describe their crimes&#8211;&#8221;final solution,&#8221; &#8220;transport to the East,&#8221; &#8220;special handling&#8221;&#8211;tell us much about them. The words the Stalinists used to describe their crimes&#8211;&#8221;purge,&#8221; &#8220;evacuation,&#8221; &#8220;re-education&#8221;&#8211;tell us much about them as well. And so we have to ask: What does our persistent failure to call Stalin&#8217;s crimes &#8220;genocide&#8221; say about us? Nothing very good, I think.

		<itunes:summary>Try to imagine having never seen an airplane. It’s hard. Aircraft are an ordinary part of our daily experience. Just look up and you’ll probably see one, or at least its vapor trails. Go to your local airport and you can fly in one pretty inexpensively. Heck, if you like, you can learn to pilot one yourself at any one of hundreds of flying schools. There is just nothing unusual or even very exciting about airships.
It wasn’t always so.  In the first quarter of the 20th century, airplanes were new. People had long dreamed of flight (see “Icarus and Daedalus”) and by the 19th century they’d done a little of it in balloons. But most folks could hardly conceive of a man (or woman) taking to the air like a bird. But men (and soon women) did just that. To many contemporary observers, flying in winged airships was nothing short of a miracle. Surely, pundits claimed, conquest of the air would usher in a new modern age.
It did, but not in all the ways expected. As Thomas Kessner shows in his wonderfully told The Flight of the Century: Charles Lindbergh &#38; the Rise of American Aviation (Oxford University Press, 2010), the experience of Charles Lindbergh is a case in point. To be sure, Lindbergh was an extraordinary pilot—skilled, meticulous, and remarkably brave. That, however, did not set him apart from the hundreds of other fly boys of the age. What did set him apart was: 1) luck (many of his contemporaries died in crashes, and he nearly did on many occasions); 2) a single insight, doggedly pursued (that a plane with one engine, one pilot, and an 2,385 pounds of fuel could make it from New York to Paris); and 3) the fact that after Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic he became the most famous person in the world. Tom pays due attention to all three of these characteristics, but I found the last of them—Lindbergh’s incredible celebrity and its impact on him and the world—the most interesting. It’s arguable that Lindbergh was the first “superstar.” Though he had indeed done something extraordinary, he was the creation of a finely tuned, corporate-backed publicity campaign and a frenzied, tireless, and completely meritorious press corps. The people around Lindbergh understood that if they handled his “image” correctly they all could make a fortune. And so they took this gangly, taciturn, strangely aloof son of the prairie and made him the symbol of all that was good (and marketable) in the newly christened air age.

The problem was that, eventually, Lindbergh refused to play along. He was who he was, and who he was was a loner. Celebrity wore on him. Now when most people get tired of attention, they go home. But after the Paris flight Lindbergh had no home. His entire life was public.  So he did what so many frustrated celebrities with considerable resources (think Howard Hughes, Marlon Brando, J. D. Salinger)  after him have done: he became a crank. He tried to find a way to live for ever, dabbled in ‘scientific racism,’ and eventually got mixed up with the Nazis. Lindbergh, the arch-individualist, got tired of having people tell him who he was; he wanted to be his own man. And, in the end, he was, for good and ill.
The lesson? If you are in the business of making and selling role models, it’s probably not a good idea to pick a 27-year old who has focused his life on some narrow pursuit to the exclusion of all others, even if he’s really good at it. You just don’t know what they’re going to “be” when they grow up. (For more, see &#8220;Michael Jackson,&#8221; &#8220;Lindsey Lohan,&#8221; &#8220;LeBron James,&#8221; etc., etc.)

		<itunes:summary>There’s a quip that goes “Christianity is probably a great religion. Someone should really try it.” The implication, of course, is that most people who call themselves Christians aren&#8217;t very Christian at all. And, in truth, it&#8217;s hard to be a good Christian, what with all that loving your enemies, turning the other cheek, and helping the poor. It’s particularly hard to pull off in the modern world. But some have tried, at least in part. Foremost among them are the Christian pacifists. They are the subject of Kip Kosek&#8217;s wonderful book Acts of Conscience: Christian Nonviolence and Modern American Democracy  (Columbia University Press, 2009). Kip shows that the pacifists—more specifically members of the Fellowship of Reconciliation (FoR)—were an oddly influential group. They utterly failed in their primary mission, that is, to create a world without war. They themselves didn’t fight, but that didn’t stop everyone else from going at it hammer and tong. Yet in pursuing that quixotic end the pacifists managed to either launch or aid several progressive causes that stand at the center of modern political life. These include: civil liberties (the ACLU), racial equality (the Civil Rights Movement), the Anti-Vietnam war campaign (the SNCC), and the nuclear disarmament movement (the Nuclear Freeze Campaign) among others. The members of FoR were on the right side of all these issues before it was clear what the right side was. And they suffered for it, though they were vindicated in the end. Kip does an excellent job of explaining how their Christian faith gave them the courage of their convictions and thereby allowed them—a tiny group of believers—to help create modern liberal democracy.
It’s very common today for seemingly sensible people to claim that religion is the cause of much that is the wrong in the world. But, as Kip demonstrates, it’s also the cause of much that is right.

		<itunes:summary>Don’t you find it a bit curious that there are literally thousands of pills that we in the developed world take on a daily basis, but only one of them is called “the Pill?” Actually, you probably don’t find it curious, because you know that the pill has had a massive impact on modern life. And why wouldn’t it? Thanks to the Pill, women alone—without the (unreliable) “cooperation” of their sexual partners—could control their own fertility. For the first time in human history. The first time. Think of the implications. No more worrying about missed periods. No more shotgun weddings. No more unwanted children. And a lot more and better sex to boot. What a boon!
Or was it? The most interesting thing about Elaine Tyler May&#8216;s pithy America and the Pill: A History of Promise, Peril, and Liberation (Basic Books, 2010) is that she shows that the Pill really didn’t live up to expectations then and it hasn’t now. After all, the Pill is a form of contraception, and contraception has been available for a long time. By the mid-twentieth century, in fact, there were many highly effective forms of birth control available in much of the developed world. So in a sense the Pill wasn’t exactly new. But it was different, and that made the folks who promoted and developed it believe—or say they believed—that it was going to solve many of humanity&#8217;s problems, foremost among them over-population and the oppression of women. It’s arguable, however, that it had little direct impact on either. Worldwide population growth, though it has slowed, is still quite high. Women remain second-class citizens (and, more interestingly, second-class family members) over much of the planet.
So what did the Pill do except raise expectations? Well, quite a lot, really. First, it gave women new power. They could control their fertility (not to mention periods) if they wanted to. That didn’t mean they had to, or even that all of them wanted to. But they could. If men were threatened by that fact, tough. They’d have to live with it (and in the developed world most of them have). Second, the Pill allowed women to put off childbearing until they  had established careers, thus facilitating (though not causing) a  massive increase in the number and percentage of women in the workforce. For many women, the Pill made an &#8220;either/or&#8221; proposition (either mother or career)  into a &#8220;this and that&#8221; proposition (mother and worker). On this front,  we&#8217;ve still a way to go, but the Pill moved us in the right direction. The Pill, however, wasn’t just about physical power over childbearing. It was also, as Elaine points out, a potent symbol of women’s empowerment. It wasn’t only what the Pill actually did (that, as we’ve said, wasn’t entirely new), it was what people believed it meant. And that, in a word, was liberation.

		<itunes:summary>Clausewitz famously said war was the “continuation of politics by other means.” Had he been unfortunate enough to witness the way the Wehrmacht fought on the Eastern Front in World War II, he might well have said war (or at least that war) was the “continuation of politics by any means.” Hitler was terribly specific about this. The Slavs, he said, were Untermenschen (subhumans). The Communists were Judeo-bolschewisten (Jewish Bolsheviks). Soviet soldiers were keine Kameraden (not comrades-in-arms). The East was future German Lebensraum (living space). All this meant that the ordinary rules of armed conflict had to be suspended. The German armed forces were to conduct a Vernichtungskrieg, a war of annihilation.
The German military had never been in the business of wanton destruction. On the contrary, it prided itself on being the most professional fighting force in the world. It was admired for many things, but two of them were honor and loyalty. And it was the clash of these two otherwise laudable traits that got the Wehrmacht in deep trouble, for Hitler essentially ask the German military to choose between the two in the East. Would the army uphold the traditional, honorable ideal of civilized military conduct, or would it remain loyal to Hitler and prosecute his Vernichtungskrieg?
As Valerie Hébert shows in her remarkable Hitler&#8217;s Generals on Trial: The Last War Crimes Tribunal at Nuremberg (University Press of Kansas, 2010), they chose the latter course. At Hitler’s request, they murdered civilians, starved prisoners of war, and enslaved occupied peoples by the millions. So it’s little wonder that after the war the victors called the leaders of the Wehrmacht to account for their thoroughly criminal behavior. And here they behaved no better, for they lamely claimed that they didn’t commit these outrages, didn’t know others were committing them, or were under orders so they had no choice. When they did admit to killing thousands in one or another Aktion, they claimed it was military necessity or that they were forced to be brutal because the Soviets were more brutal still (a pathetic instance of blaming the victim).

Given the setting (their honor and even lives were on the line), it’s not surprising that they lied and rationalized. What is more unsettling is that they showed little or no remorse for what they had done (during or after the trials) and that they enjoyed considerable sympathy within the German population. As Valarie points out, the Germans mounted large campaigns both against the Nuremberg proceedings and for the release of the Wehrmacht-criminals after they had been incarcerated. The former were unsuccessful, though the latter resulted in the premature release of nearly all those convicted in the Wehrmacht trials.

		<itunes:summary>I have a (much beloved) colleague who calls all history about things before AD 1900 “that old stuff.” Of course she means it as a gentle jab at those of us who study said “old stuff.” Gentle, but in some ways telling. Many historians and history readers genuinely have a bias against the older periods, and particularly against the history of the pre-Hellenic Ancient World (roughly 10,000 BCE to 500 BCE). That’s really too bad for a whole host of reasons. For the sake of brevity, I’ll just list three &#8220;biggies&#8221;:
1) The Ancient World witnessed the greatest single break in the history of humankind, that is, the transition from hunter-gather to sedentary agricultural life;
2) The deepest roots of our civilizations (Western, Eastern, you name it) are mostly to be found in the Ancient World;

3) Finally, the basic institutions of what we think of as “modern” life were all hammered out for the first time in the Ancient World.
Take, for example, diplomacy. As Amanda Podany shows in her engaging new book Brotherhood of Kings: How International Relations Shaped the Ancient Near East (Oxford University Press, 2010), the rulers of Sumer, Akkad, Syria, Egypt and the rest developed a way of dealing with one another that will be strikingly familiar to anyone who follows modern international relations. They regularly sent envoys to one another. Those envoys were given safe passage, provided with diplomatic immunity, and treated as special guests. Royal representatives followed strict instructions from their masters. They negotiated formal treaties, which included such things as the conditions for international trade. They presented gifts from their masters to their hosts and expected gifts in return. They arranged for diplomatic marriages of the kind any student of European history would recognize. All this is nothing if not strikingly “modern.” Yet, as Amanda points out, the entire system was invented over 4,000 years ago. And, thanks to Amanda, you can read all about it.
If you do, you won&#8217;t think of &#8220;that old stuff&#8221; as really that old, or at least odd.

		<itunes:summary>In the late 19th century, French sociologist Émile Durkheim warned the world about spreading “normlessness” (anomie). He claimed that modern society, and particularly life in concentrated urban-industrial areas like Paris, left people without the sense of belonging that characterized “traditional” life. Durkheim was not alone in thinking that there was something fundamentally sick-making about modernity. Marx called the modern malady “alienation” (Entfremdung), Weber called it “disenchantment” (Entzauberung), and Freud called it “discontent” (Unbehagen). The more general term used in fin de siècle Europe was “neurasthenia,” a condition of nervous exhaustion caused by the frenetic pace of modern life.
The theory that modernity was pathological was put to the test on several occasions in the early twentieth century. One of the earliest was the Paris flood of 1910. It&#8217;s the subject of Jeffrey H. Jackson&#8216;s wonderfully told tale Paris Under Water: How the City of Light Survived the Great Flood of 1910 (Palgrave-MacMillan, 2010). By Jackson’s revealing lights, social science did not fare very well. When the Seine river literally rose up out of the ground and over its banks, things in Paris did not fall apart as Durkheim, Marx, Weber, and Freud might have predicted. Far from it: the Parisians generally pulled together, fought the rising waters, and helped one another. They were not “normless,” “alienated,” “disenchanted,” or “discontented.” They knew just who they were: French citizens. They knew just what to do: lend a hand. And they knew just why they did it: national duty. This isn’t to say that some sort of ideal democracy magically emerged out of the flood waters. It didn’t. As is always the case, people in desperate situations do desperate (and often stupid) things. The deluge ripped the veneer of normalcy from daily life and revealed underlying conflicts. But more than anything else the Paris flood revealed the remarkable strength of modern republican nation-states.  Unlike their much praised “traditional” counterparts—the monarchies of early modern Europe—they did not fall apart when put under significant strain. They cohered and even grew stronger.
We shouldn’t think, however, that this solidarity was an entirely good thing. National unity had a much darker side, as would be shown only a few years later. Nations are often very good at helping themselves, as the Paris flood demonstrated. But they are also very good (if “good” is the right word) at fighting other nations, as was demonstrated with horrible clarity in World War I and World War II.

		<itunes:summary>I have a good friend who grew up in East Germany in the bad old days. The East German authorities suspected that her family would try to immigrate to the West (which they did), so they naturally told the Stasi—the East German secret service—to watch them (which they did). After the fall of the Wall, the Stasi files were opened and my friend requested to see her dossier. I have to say, it was disappointing. For some reason (perhaps having to do with John le Carré), I thought the Stasi was a ruthlessly efficient, super-clandestine, surveillance-repression machine. But I couldn’t find that machine in my friend’s file. It was boring. She did this, did that, she did the other thing. Why would anyone care?
Read Gary Bruce&#8216;s wonderful The Firm: The Inside Story of the Stasi (OUP, 2010) and you can find out why. But don’t expect it to make any sense, because the picture Gary paints is of a kind of Bizarro World. Like their handlers in the Soviet Union, the East German communist party was mindlessly paranoid. They saw—or at least claimed to see—“enemies” under every rock. This (mis)perception was the pretext for the creation of the Stasi: it would protect the revolution from said “enemies.” (It would also prevent East Germans from fleeing to the West, but that was just an added bonus.) How?
First, they needed agents. These weren’t hard to get in the post-war years. There were lots of idealistic communists who were quite willing to go to work for the cause. One of the revelations of Gary’s work is that many (most?) Stasi agents believed in what they were doing. Those that didn’t recognized that the pay was good. Next, you needed your trusty agents to recruit “co-workers,” that is, informants. This was not as easy. Gary’s subjects worried a lot about meeting their recruitment quotas; really good informants were hard to find. But generally they found them (or made them up). Finally, you had to have your agents work their informants, that is, meet with them regularly and pump them for valuable information. This was the hardest job of all. Gary’s work makes clear that most Stasi agents viewed the regular meeting (again, they had quotas) as a hassle. More than that, they were generally seen as completely unproductive. We now know what the Stasi agents could doubtlessly have told us long ago: there were no “enemies.” With the singular exception of Poland, no Eastern Bloc state ever hosted anything like an organized “opposition” to communism or anything else. A lot of folks were unhappy with, for example, Party hypocrisy, the price of sausage, or the inability to travel abroad. But there was no “underground” to go into to fight for, well, whatever one might fight for. This being so, the vast majority of Stasi agents worked for decades without ever turning up anything beyond the occasional extra-marital affair—hardly the kind of thing that would endanger the “republic.”

What they did accomplish, and perhaps what the Stasi itself was meant to accomplish, was to frighten the populace. You don’t need to watch everyone to give the impression that everyone is being watched and, if “seen,” being punished. In the end, the myth of the Stasi was more important for the stability of the East German regime that its practice.

		<itunes:summary>In the 1940s, the United States military performed an “experiment,” the substance of which was the formation of an all-black aviation unit known to history as the “Tuskegee Airmen.” In light of the honorable service record of countless African Americans, allowing blacks to become fighter and bomber pilots might not seem very “experimental” to you, but you have to put yourself in the mindset of the era in question to understand how &#8220;experimental&#8221; it was. Jim-Crow segregation was nearly universal, especially, though not exclusively, in the South. The armed forces were similarly segregated, with blacks serving in what might be mildly called “auxiliary roles” and whites doing all the commanding and fighting. There were few black officers (and they never supervised white troops) and no black military pilots. Most of the (nearly all white) “brass” could not conceive of integrated units and doubted the ability of African Americans to serve as line officers; most of those in the majority white voting public shared these views. When the argument to native ability failed (after all, black units had performed well in the Civil War and World War I), opponents of integration fell back on a familiar argument: if &#8220;we&#8221; allow “them” to serve with &#8220;us,&#8221; chaos will ensue and fighting effectiveness will suffer.
But black leaders didn’t buy it; they wanted integration. The Roosevelt administration sat on the fence. It clearly couldn’t embark on full-scale integration (and, it must be said, FDR himself had doubts about it), but it couldn’t forgo black votes. So it compromised: blacks would get one high-profile flying unit, but integration would be deferred. And so the great experiment began. Todd Moye has mined the archives and talked to the airmen to tell the tale of how said experiment proceeded in his terrific Freedom Flyers: The Tuskegee Airmen of World War II (OUP, 2010). It’s a tale I found both uplifting and shocking. I’m not usually one to heap praise on people, but the pilots themselves were remarkably brave. It is hard for me to imagine what they went through to get their wings and fight for the country they loved. I found myself again and again asking “How could they do that?” Todd does a terrific job of setting the scene and helping us understand their struggle.  I confess I find it just as hard to enter the mindset of those whites who stood against them. They were racists and more frighteningly racists with absolutely clean consciences. When they said that blacks didn’t have the “right stuff” to become pilots, to command troops, to serve in integrated units, they believed it. Their testimony, again very ably related by Todd, is simply difficult to read. Here too I found myself asking again and again “How could they do that?”
It was a different world. Parts of it, however, are obviously still with us. What is “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” but the executive branch’s attempt to find a “middle way” between integrationists and their opponents? Harry Truman, where are you now?

		<itunes:summary>Historians don’t generally like the idea of “human nature.” We tend to believe that people are intrinsically malleable, that they have no innate “drives,” “instincts,” or “motivations.” The reason we hew to the “blank slate” notion perhaps has to do with the fact—and it is a fact—that we see remarkable diversity in the historical record. The past, we say, is a foreign country; they do things differently there. But there are also political reasons to hold to the idea that we have no essence, that everything is “socially constructed.” Where, for example, would modern liberalism be without this concept? If our natures are fixed in some way, then what should we do to improve our lot?
Given the strength and utility of the “blank slate” doctrine, anyone hoping to question it successfully must possess considerable political savvy and, more importantly, an overwhelming mass of evidence. When the first modern challenge was issued—by the Sociobiologists of the 1970s—they had the latter (I would say), but not the former.  Happily, their successors—principally the practitioners of “evolutionary psychology”—have both (again, in  my opinion). Azar Gat is a good example. In his pathbreaking War in Human Civilization (Oxford UP, 2006), he explains in politically palatable and empirically convincing terms just why, evolutionarily speaking, our evolved natures guided the way we have fought over the past 200,000 years. He rejects the notion that we have anything like a “violence instinct.” Rather, we have a kind of “violence tool,” given to us by natural selection. In certain circumstances, we are psychologically inclined to use it; in others, not. In this way we are no different than many of our fellow species, the primates in particular. Of course, unlike them, our use of collective violence has an (extra-genetic) history. Azar does a masterful job of describing and explaining how, even while our nature has remained the same, the way we fight has changed. And here the news is good: believe it or not, we—humanity as a whole—have been becoming more peaceful over the past 10,000 years, and radically more peaceful (at least in the developed world) over the past 200 years. Azar can explain this too, and does in the interview.
I cannot emphasis enough how important this book is, both as a model of what I would call “scientifically-informed” history and a sort of guide to those of us who, despite having abandoned the “blank slate,” believe that we have the capacity to create a better world.

		<itunes:summary>The Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 was the most important political event of the twentieth century (no Revolution; no Nazis; no Nazis, no World War II; no World War II, no Cold War). It’s little wonder, then, that historians have expended oceans of effort and ink trying to explain why and how it happened. The answer is complex, but it boils down to this: Nicholas II’s armies had a rough time of it in World War I, his regime lost credibility, the hungry cities revolted, and the Bolsheviks usurped power in an armed coup. The key event was, then, the Russian loss to the Germans on the Eastern Front. Surprisingly, the Russian defeat —arguably the second most important political event of the twentieth century because it triggered the first—has not been widely studied. For my generation of Russian historians (and, I should add, the one that preceded it), the Revolution—the last, best hope of mankind to many—was a sexy topic indeed; the failure of the Russian Imperial Army, not so much. So we were left in the dark (or, rather, left ourselves in the dark). There were, however, historians who went against this grain. Among them are (to name only a few and those who write in English): John Bushnell, William Fuller, Peter Gatrell, Hubertus Jahn, Eric Lohr, Bruce Menning, David Rich, David Schimmelpenninck van der Oye, Norman Stone, Allen Wildman and our guest today  John Steinberg. Steinberg’s wonderful new book All the Tsar&#8217;s Men: Russia&#8217;s General Staff and the Fate of the Empire, 1898-1914 (Johns Hopkins/Wilson Center, 2010) is a significant contribution to our understanding of the roots of the Russian defeat in World War I. His focus is the Imperial General Staff and its struggle (failed, as it turned out) to reform itself and the army that it commanded. As Steinberg points out, their task was a difficult one, made much more so by Russia’s all-encompassing (and to a considerable degree self-imposed) backwardness. The leaders of the General Staff were smart people. They knew what to do to make the Imperial Army a first-rate fighting force. Under other leadership, they might have succeeded in modernizing the army. But Nicholas did not lead, and so nothing could be done. Autocracies depend on autocrats, and Russia had none when it needed one most.

		<itunes:summary>The past is always with us, but it’s really always with politicians. Once you put yourself up for office, and particularly national office, everybody and his brother is going to start digging into your past to see what kind of “dirt” they can find. It’s true now, and it was true when Thomas Jefferson was running for president in the late eighteenth century. Jefferson had had an eventful, largely public life, so there was a lot of “material” to be mined by his foes. Most of the accusations “didn’t stick,” but one that did was that he was a coward. Jefferson was the governor of Virginia during a good portion of the Revolutionary War and, as such, charged with defending the place (and the Revolution) against the British. As Michael Kranish shows in his terrific book Flight from Monticello: Thomas Jefferson at War (Oxford UP, 2010), he had a rough time of it. Jefferson had no military experience, didn’t like “standing” armies, and received only tepid support from his continental allies. The British invaded, invaded, and invaded again. Jefferson fled, fled, and fled again. What was he supposed to do? His political opponents didn’t care if he had no choice but to run or not—the fact that he didn’t stand and fight was enough to prove he was a “coward.” This charge wounded Jefferson deeply and he fought it for much of his life.
The episode sort of reminded me of a certain presidential candidate a few years back and (shameful, in my opinion) questions about his military service.

		<itunes:summary>I confess I was attracted to this book by the title: Capitalism and the Jews (Princeton, 2010). Capitalism is a touchy subject; Jews are a touchy subject. But capitalism and the Jews, that&#8217;s a disaster waiting to happen. I don&#8217;t suggest you try this, but just imagine what would happen if you started a water-cooler chat with &#8220;Hey, what do you think of capitalism and the Jews?&#8221; Not pretty.  So, being a bit curious, I wanted to know who would write a book with said title and what they could possibly say that wouldn&#8217;t get people calling for their head. Well, here&#8217;s what I found out. The book was written by Jerry Muller who, I can tell you with all earnestness, is a very bright fellow, an excellent (and witty) writer, and someone with a load of interesting things to say about capitalism and Jews. Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s not what you think. Muller&#8217;s book is no spittle-encrusted diatribe against greedy, hook-nosed, money-lenders.  But neither is it the kind of book that ignores the (too often considered embarrassing or offensive) facts, the central one here being that Jews are, as Muller well puts it, good at capitalism. There is no Judeophobia or Judeophilia to be found in these pages. Rather, there is a fascinating, meditative, and enlightening account of the historical relationship of capitalism and the Jews, predominately in Europe over the last thousand or so years. This book is full of cool-headed, convincing arguments about controversial, oft-asked historical questions: Why are Jews good at capitalism? What made European Jews different from other diaspora communities? What role did the Jews play in the evolution of capitalism? What attracted some Jews to socialism? Why do we think&#8211;wrongly as it turns out&#8211;that there was an affinity between Jews and communism? How did Jews themselves react to the strong association between capitalism and their faith? How did Christians react to the same association?
If you read this book, and I hope you do, you will be able to sensibly answer all these question. And really, you have no reason not to read it because it is a model of brevity. It&#8217;s rare that you find so much packed into so few pages. But that&#8217;s what you&#8217;d expect, I suppose, out of a very bright fellow, excellent writer, and someone with a load of interesting things to say&#8230;

		<itunes:summary>If you’re like me (and I hope you aren’t), the “Trial of the Century” involved a washed-up football star, a slowly moving white Bronco, an ill-fitting glove, and charges of racism. I watched every bit of it and remember exactly where I was when the verdict was announced. But if you are French (which is a nice thing to be), then there is only one “Trial of the Century” and it involved an honorable though stuffy army captain, a torn up note of no significance, a bungling military establishment, and charges of anti-Semitism. The erstwhile American football player (and actor, don’t forget he was an actor) was guilty, pretty much everyone knew it, but no one really wanted to take the issue on. The aloof French officer was innocent, pretty much everyone knew it too, but in this instance a kind of culture war broke out.
France circa 1900 was at a fork in the historical road: on the left, the liberalism of the Revolution; on the right, the conservatism of the post-Napoleonic settlement. So which was it to be: France a nation of free-thinking citizens or France a nation of Catholic Frenchmen? The question was not definitively answered during the Dreyfus Affair, but new (and somewhat disturbing) possibilities were sketched out. The analysis of these new paths is one (among many) of the great strengths of Ruth Harris&#8216;s new book Dreyfus: Politics, Emotion, and the Scandal of the Century (Henry Holt, 2010) . She shows that both sides—the Dreyfusards (aka “Intellectuals”) and the Anti-Intellectuals—used the Affair to elaborate their visions for France and, in the process, worked themselves into a tizzy. They began to believe things that, well, only a lunatic could believe. French political culture entered a kind of surreal moment (a bit like American political culture during the O.J. trial if you ask me). Alas, the French didn’t quickly come back to reality after the Affair ended. They organized parties and continued to fight. And they are still fighting.

		<itunes:summary>You’ve probably heard of hipsters. Heck, you may even be a hipster. If you don’t know what a hipster is, you might spend some time on this sometimes entertaining website. Where do hipsters come from? Lets work backwards. Before hipsters (1990s), there were slackers (1980s): middle-class, college-going, white kids into Alternative rock. They were hipsters in all but name. Before slackers, there were punks and pseudo-mods (1970s): middle-class, college-going, white kids into Punk and New Wave rock respectively. Neither of them was really “hip” because they liked to take speed and be “intense.” Before punks and pseudo-mods, there were hippies (1960s): middle-class, college-going, white kids into rock and folk. They weren’t “hip” because they smoked a lot of dope and were embarrassingly earnest. Before hippies, there were beats (1950s): middle class, college-going, white kids into outré poetry and literature. They weren’t &#8220;hip&#8221; because they took narcotics and liked to be “cool.” Before beats, there were proto-hipsters (1940s): middle-class, college-going, white kids who liked hot jazz and black people. They were more like modern wiggers than hipsters. (If you don’t know what a wigger is, here you go.) And before proto-hipsters, there was the mother of all middle-class, college-going, white American subcultures—the bohemians. They were a lot like hipsters.
These hipsters-before-hipsters  are the subject of Joanna Levin&#8216;s fascinating new book  Bohemia in America, 1858-1920  (Stanford UP, 2010). In it, she deftly traces the mid-nineteenth-century migration of bohemianism from the Parisian Latin Quarter to American shores and its spread to middle class, white culture thereafter. Bohemianism offered Americans who, as Tocqueville noted, were all about equality (read: conformity) a chance to be different in a safe way. The bohemians practiced a kind of satire-of-the-deed: they used themselves&#8211;the way they dressed, talked, loved, worked&#8211;to poke fun at everything &#8220;bourgeois.&#8221;  They were performance artists, and they wanted attention. Just like hipsters.

		<itunes:summary>Of all the events in American history, two are far and away the most troubling: slavery and the near-genocidal war against native Americans. In truth, we&#8217;ve dealt much better with the former than the latter. The slaves were emancipated. After a long and painful struggle, their descendants won their full civil rights. Though that struggle is not yet finished, near equality has been reached in many areas of American life. And almost all Americans understand that slavery was wrong. None of this can be said about the campaign against native Americans. Instead of emancipation, the Indians&#8211;or rather those left after the slaughter&#8211;were &#8220;removed&#8221; to reservations where their way of life was destroyed. After a long and painful struggle, many of their descendants are still in those reservations and living in poverty.  They struggle still, but are not equal to other Americans by most measures. And many Americans refuse to believe that the U.S. was wrong in killing, sequestering, and impoverishing the native Americans.
They are wrong to do so, for we know what happened and why thanks to historians such as Heather Cox Richardson. In her eye-opening new book Wounded Knee: Party Politics and the Road to an American Massacre (Basic Books, 2010) she shows just how calculated, self-serving, and even spiteful the White assault on the Plains Indians was. Despite what they said (mostly to the Indians themselves), the Whites never had any real intention of allowing the Sioux and others to keep their land, maintain their way of life, or even to continue to exist. It was clear to them that the Indians would either become White (meaning would take up farming) or would go. The Whites weren&#8217;t exactly cynics; rather they were self-deceiving fatalists. They came to believe that destiny itself compelled them to assimilate or annihilate the Indians.
But destiny didn&#8217;t destroy the Plains Indians. The government of the United States of America did.

		<itunes:summary>It&#8217;s one thing to say that the study of history is &#8220;relevant&#8221; to contemporary problems; it&#8217;s another to demonstrate it. In How Terrorism Ends: Understanding the Decline and Demise of Terrorist Campaigns(Princeton UP, 2009), Audrey Kurth Cronin does so in splendid fashion. She poses a common and very important question: what should we do about modern terrorism in general and Al-Qaeda in particular? To answer this query, she poses another (and quite original) question: how do terrorist campaigns usually end? The logic is simple and compelling: if we want to stop a terrorist campaign, we would do well to understand how terrorist campaigns generally stop. To do this, she reviews the history of modern terrorist campaigns, analyses the means by which they ended, and then presents an original typology of endings. With said typology, she can tell us what works in terms of anti-terrorism and what doesn&#8217;t in what circumstances. For example, her research shows that &#8220;decapitating&#8221; Al-Qaeda won&#8217;t work; other leaders will (and already have) sprung up to continue the terror campaign. Neither will negotiating with Al-Qaeda work because: a) there is no one to negotiate with and b) Al-Qaeda has no coherent list of demands. The cases Cronin examines suggest an entirely different approach, one that promotes the (already on-going) disintegration of Al-Qaeda from within.  Al-Qaeda, Cronin says, is showing signs of imploding; we should just help it along.
This is a rich book and a model of how to use history for policy-making. I think I&#8217;ll send President Obama a copy.

		<itunes:summary>Sometimes when you win you lose. That’s called a Pyrrhic victory. But sometimes when you lose you win. We don’t have a name for that (at least as far as I know). But we might call it an “Easter Rising victory” after the Irish Republican revolt of 1916. The Republicans took over several buildings in Dublin, declared an Irish republic, and then were promptly obliterated by the British Army. Their leaders were executed, their republic disbanded, and their enemies remained in control of the island. They lost. Or did they? Shortly after the disastrous uprising, the Republican cause began to gather force. Its fallen leaders became martyrs to the Irish nation, the idea of a republic grew in popularity, and once moderate Constitutional Nationalists began to fight the British. Within a short three years, the Irish republic was back; in another three years the &#8220;Irish Free State&#8221;—not exactly independent of London, but much closer than before—was established. In The Rising. Ireland: Easter, 1916 (Oxford, 2010), Fearghal McGarry does a terrific job of describing the complicated ins and outs of the Rising and its impact on Irish politics. The book really shows us the revolt &#8220;from below,&#8221; that is, from the point of view of those who fought in it. Fearghal is able to gain this perspective because of a remarkable source. In the 1940s, the Irish authorities, knowing that witnesses to the Rising were passing, had the presence of mind to conduct a large survey of participants. They collected well over 1,000 accounts, all of which became available in 2002. Fearghal mines these reports to reconstruct how the men- and women-on-the-street experienced the revolt. The results are remarkable. The Rising appears anew as an event at once tragic, terrifying, and farcical. In hindsight, we can see that the Rising changed Irish politics forever; at the time, amidst the bravery, blood, and rubble, few saw any such thing. Most were just scared.

		<itunes:summary>You may not know who John Galsworthy is, but you probably know his work. Who hasn&#8217;t seen some production of The Forsyte Saga? Galsworthy was one of the most popular and famous British writers of the early 20th century (the Edwardian Era). He left an enormous body of work, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1932. But Galsworthy was also what we might call a &#8220;public humanitarian,&#8221; that is, he used his high profile and influence in a great, good cause. The focus of his effort was disabled solders returning from World War I. We, of course, are well acquainted with the remarkable destructive power of modern weaponry. Not a week goes by (alas) in which we do not hear about a soldier being wounded by mines, grenades, artillery fire or bombs (often of the &#8220;roadside&#8221; variety). But we also have come to expect that soldier, no matter how grievously wounded, will receive medical treatment that will stand at least a fighting chance of saving their lives. And indeed, many wounded soldiers do survive incredibly severe injuries and return to our world. The generation that fought and suffered World War I&#8211;or as they called it &#8220;The Great War&#8221;&#8211;were really not familiar with any of this. Europeans and Americans of the nineteenth century were surely used to wars, but they were generally short and decided by pivotal battles (Waterloo, Gettysburg, Sedan). But the Great War was different. Millions of men lived for years at the &#8220;front&#8221; and under the shells. Many died there and many more were wounded. Thanks to advances in medical knowledge (and particularly the discovery of the germ theory of disease), a goodly proportion of the wounded survived. This presented a new problem: How to re-integrate wounded men into society? This became Galsworthy&#8217;s cause. The course of his efforts on the part of wounded soldiers is detailed with great skill and care by  Jeffrey Reznick in his John Galsworthy and the Disabled Soldiers of the Great War (Manchester UP, 2009). Reznick shows us Galsworthy attempting to create the modern infrastructure of veterans&#8217; care: special hospitals, rehabilitation programs, work-transition agencies and so on. And we get to read Galsworthy&#8217;s writing on the subject, both non-fiction and fiction. All this give us&#8211;or gave me&#8211;a new understanding of Galsworthy&#8217;s literary work. Galsworthy was a great man. But as it turned out he was greater than I knew. We should thank Jeff for bringing his good-works to our attention.

		<itunes:summary>If you grew up in the 1960s or 1970s in suburbia, you probably lived in a smallish ranch house that looked like this.  That house probably had an &#8220;ultra modern&#8221; kitchen that probably looked like this. I grew up in such a house and it had such a kitchen. In fact, I think my mom, sister, and self were models for this ad. (Or may be not. My mom never baked, had a job, and generally dressed in what she called &#8220;slacks.&#8221; Very modern indeed.) Anyway, we didn&#8217;t know it, but our house, kitchen, and &#8220;life style&#8221; were fighting the Cold War. You can read all about it in Greg Castillo&#8217;s fascinating new book Cold War on the Home Front: The Soft Power of Midcentury Design (Minnesota UP, 2009). The leaders of both the Capitalist and Communist worlds claimed to be able to afford their citizens a superior way of life and in the post-war world &#8220;superior way of life&#8221; meant more, better stuff. So these same leaders enlisted industrial designers in their struggle for supremacy. The West had ranch houses, avocado kitchens, and pink telephones; the East had neo-Classical apartment blocks, reading-corners, and built-in radios (pre-tuned, of course, to official stations). In the end, I suppose, the West &#8220;won,&#8221; but as Greg points out it did so with a kind of domestic architecture and interior design that has now become so bloated that it is, economically at least, unsustainable. The average ranch house was about 1000 square feet; today the average new home in the U.S. is around 2500 square feet. Al Gore&#8217;s house is 10,000 square feet (not counting the guest and pool houses). Inconvenient, but true.

		<itunes:summary>Long ago, historians more or less gave up on &#8220;theories of history.&#8221; They determined that human nature was too unpredictable, cultures too various, and developmental patterns too evanescent for any really scientific theory of history to be possible. Human history, they said, was chaos.
The problem is that human history isn&#8217;t chaos at all. The &#8220;hard&#8221; human sciences&#8211;evolutionary biology and anthropology in particular&#8211;have shown that human nature is quite predictable, cultural variability is strictly constrained, and ongoing patterns of social development have ancient roots. Historians can ignore these facts all they like, but that doesn&#8217;t make them any the less true. It does, however, impoverish their discipline by ceding the search for a satisfying theory of history to scientists.  Neither Paul Bingham nor Joanne Souza are historians. The former is a molecular biologist and the latter an evolutionary psychologist. But they have formulated an elegant theory of human history in Death From a Distance and the Birth of a Humane Universe (2009). Like any good theory, it explains a lot with a little. To put it briefly, human society has gone from simple/small to massive/complex because humans alone among animals were/are able to suppress intra-group conflicts of interest by means of low-cost coercion. Bingham and Souza point out that the big &#8220;jumps&#8221; in social size and complexity&#8211;the neolithic revolution, the growth of archaic states, the birth of the nation-state, the rise of globalization&#8211;have all been associated with the evolution/introduction of new, more powerful coercive abilities. Paradoxically, it was new weapons that created more and better lives over the course of the last several hundred thousand years.
This brief summary cannot do justice to the richness of Bingham&#8217;s and Souza&#8217;s theory. You need to read it for yourself. When you do, I guarantee you will see the past and present in a new way.

		<itunes:summary>I was a little kid during the Vietnam War. It was on the news all the time, and besides my uncle was fighting there. I followed it closely, or as closely as a little kid can. I never thought for a moment that &#8220;we&#8221; could lose. &#8220;We&#8221; were a great country run by good people; &#8220;they&#8221; were a little country run by bad people. I spent my time building models of American tanks, planes, and ships. I read a lot of &#8220;Sergeant Rock&#8221; and watched re-runs of &#8220;Combat.&#8221; My friends and I played &#8220;war&#8221; everyday after school. Given all this, you&#8217;ll understand that I was bewildered when &#8220;we&#8221; pulled out of Vietnam. How could &#8220;we&#8221; lose the war when &#8220;we&#8221; were bigger, better, and righter? It made no sense. All this came to mind as I read Andrew Donson terrific book Youth in the Fatherless Land: War Pedagogy, Nationalism, and Authority in Germany, 1914-1918 (Harvard UP, 2010). As Andrew points out, German children were taught that their nation was great, their cause was just, and their victory inevitable. Their heads were full of heroic tales of soldiers sacrificing themselves for the good of Germany, and they longed to fight for the Vaterland themselves. So when things began to come apart in 1917, Germany&#8217;s young people were deeply disappointed. They would not &#8220;get their chance.&#8221; Rather, they would suffer hunger, humiliation, and defeat. They had hard questions for their mothers, fathers, and the authorities. How could it happen? Who is at fault? And, most importantly, what should we do? As we know, they answered this final question in different and, as it turned out, radical ways.

The odd thing is that Du Bois, who was one of the founders of the American civil rights movement and perhaps the most famous black public intellectual of the 20th century, was born and raised a stone&#8217;s throw from where my wife grew up in Western Massachusetts. If you are from Illinois, you know it is the &#8220;Land of Lincoln.&#8221; If you are from Virginia, you know that Jefferson was a Virginian. If you are from Kansas (as I am), you know that Eisenhower is a native son (even though he&#8217;s not, really). But the people of Western Massachusetts forgot Du Bois was one of their own. Or did they just choose not to remember? Amy Bass explores this question in her challenging new book Those About Him Remained Silent: The Battle Over W. E. B. Du Bois (Minnesota UP, 2009).  Those who wanted to commemorate Du Bois saw a deep thinker who had overcome racism and helped found the civil rights movement; those who did not want to remember him saw Du Bois the communist who had abandoned the United States for Africa. Du Bois was both and much, much more. But historical monuments cannot reflect such complexity; they are all about simplification through selective recollection. Du Bois, however, just couldn&#8217;t be made simple. So the battle was joined and, to some degree, is still going on today.

		<itunes:summary>Africans were the first migrants because they were the first people. Some 60,000 years ago they left their homeland and in a relatively short period of time (by geological and evolutionary standards) moved to nearly every habitable place on the globe. We are their descendants. The Africans never stopped migrating, but they began to do so with particular vigor beginning about 1400 AD.  Patrick Manning tells the story of their movements in his remarkable new book The African Diaspora: A History Through Culture (Columbia UP, 2010). The tale Pat tells might well be divided into three phases: before slavery, during slavery, and after slavery. The middle period usually gets the most attention, but happily Pat well covers the &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; phases as well. This is an excellent corrective to the standard story because it shows us that for most of modern history African migrants were not really victims, but agents. Prior to the emergence of the international slave trade, they travelled and migrated to North Africa, the Mediterranean, and the Near East in large numbers. Slavery of course violently brought millions of them to the Americas. But once it was officially ended (slavery continues to exist today&#8230;), the Africans in the diaspora set about considering their rightful place in the world. Should they build lives for themselves &#8220;abroad&#8221;? Or should they return to their African homeland? Should they integrate? Or should they remain apart? These questions&#8211;which are asked by every large diaspora community&#8211;were hotly debated in the cultural and political efflorescence of the 20th century. To some extent the debate still goes on; and to an even greater extent the African diaspora continues to grow both in numbers and in power. This is an important and neglected topic, and we should all thank professor Manning for shedding light on it.

		<itunes:summary>One night my wife and I were on the road, staying in a hotel in I-don&#8217;t-remember-where. I woke up in the middle of the night to find said wife missing. Happily, I saw a light under the bathroom door. There she is, I thought. I fell back asleep. I woke up again sometime later. It was still the middle of the night and that light was still on. Hmm&#8230;. What&#8217;s up with that? I wonder if she&#8217;s okay? I should check. So I got out of bed, lumbered over to the bathroom door, opened it and, well, there she sat. She was not, however, doing what one normally does in the bathroom (though I can&#8217;t say what you normally do in a bathroom). Nope. She was sitting on the john (lid down!) reading The Children&#8217;s Blizzard by David Laskin. &#8220;I just couldn&#8217;t stop and I didn&#8217;t want to wake you up.&#8221;
So when I heard that David had a new book coming out&#8211;The Long Way Home. An American Journey from Ellis Island to the Great War (HarperCollins, 2010)&#8211;I jumped at the chance to read it and get him on the show. The book tells the stories of twelve Americans who immigrated from Europe to the US around 1900 and then returned to Europe to fight in the Great War for their newly-adopted country. It&#8217;s a tale of poverty, hope, escape, new beginnings, disappointments, hard work (for low pay), patriotism, bravery, suffering, death and redemption all told in wonderfully crafted prose. Through the lives of these men and their families David allows us to witness &#8220;ethnics&#8221; (as they were called) adopting an American identity, and often at a heavy price. They literally fought for the right to be Americans. For those of us born in freedom, their bravery is a reminder of what freedom is worth. (I know that sounds a bit dramatic, but I actually believe it&#8230;)

		<itunes:summary>I&#8217;ve got a name for you: Robert Zimmerman (aka Shabtai Zisel ben Avraham).  You&#8217;ve heard of him. He was a Jewish kid from Hibbing, Minnesota. But he didn&#8217;t (as the stereotype would suggest) become a doctor, lawyer, professor or businessman. Nope, the professions were not for him. He loved the American folk legend Woody Guthrie (of &#8220;This Land is Your Land&#8221; fame). In fact, he wanted to become the next Woodie Guthrie. So he more or less left his Jewish roots, changed his name to Bob Dylan, and immersed himself in American folk music.
Most Americans know this story and others like it. In fact, it seems like a peculiarly American story. But, as you will read in Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern&#8216;s fascinating The Anti-Imperial Choice: The Making of the Ukrainian Jew (Yale, 2009), it&#8217;s not. It can be found in&#8211;of all places&#8211;Ukraine. The story of the Jews in Ukraine is not exactly a happy one (cf. &#8220;pogroms&#8221;). The relationship between Jews and Ukrainians has always, it seems, been one of mutual mistrust. Therefore it is all the more surprising to find a tradition of Jewish literati who devoted themselves body and soul to the cause of Ukrainian culture and the foundation of a Ukrainian state.  But that is in fact what Yohanan has uncovered. The Anti-Imperial Choice discusses five Jewish-born authors who &#8220;adopted&#8221; (so to say) the Ukrainian movement in favor of the dominant imperial culture (Russian, German, etc.). They were a minority (Jews) and they elected to affiliate with a minority (Ukrainians). Yohanan does a masterful job of describing the ways in which these authors fused Jewishness and Ukrainianess into a significant literary canon in the Ukrainian language. Remarkable and food for thought indeed.
Let me also add that the book is wonderfully written. It is always amazing to me to see someone write with this level of mastery in a second language. Actually, I think English is Yohanan&#8217;s fourth or fifth language (which makes it that much more amazing&#8230;).

By the way, it&#8217;s our 100th show!  Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s supported NBH. Please become a fan of the show on Facebook if you haven&#8217;t already.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Here&#8217;s something I learned by reading Joel Wolfe&#8217;s terrific Autos and Progress: The Brazilian Search for Modernity (Oxford, 2010): the United States and Brazil have a lot in common. Both hived off European empires; both struggled with slavery and its legacy; both are profoundly multiethnic and multiracial; both have spent much of their respective histories settling a vast &#8220;wild&#8221; frontier (though, to be fair, it was already &#8220;settled&#8221; by indigenous people); and, most importantly for our purposes, both are car-crazy, and indeed for almost the same reason. In the United States, the automobile meant modernity. It was the implement with which we, Americans of every stripe, would &#8220;tame&#8221; a continent and thereby realize our national potential. The Brazilians, according to Wolfe, feel the same way.  Joel does a masterful job of explaining how the promise of this crucial technology entered the Brazilian psyche and became not only the vehicle of modernity (pardon the pun) but also the symbol of everything modern.  Along the way Joel explodes one of the foundational myths of modern anti-globalism (and what used to be called &#8220;anti-imperialism&#8221;), namely, that powerful &#8220;multinational corporations&#8221; muscled their way into undeveloped countries and fostered a crippling &#8220;dependency.&#8221; Not in Brazil. The Brazilians invited Ford, GM, and VW into the country with a full understanding of what they were getting; they embraced the values these corporations fostered, all of which were seen as &#8220;modern&#8221;; and when things weren&#8217;t working out, they essentially forced them to act according to Brazilian interests. The Brazilians were, so to speak, in the driver&#8217;s seat of automobilismo; the supposedly all-powerful multinationals were along for the ride.  In the end, both enjoyed the journey, despite some rough patches. I&#8217;m happy to say, however, that this book has no rough spots at all. You will drive carefree from the first to the last page. Have a good trip.

		<itunes:summary>In preparation for this interview I watched the documentary (that&#8217;s what the producers call it, anyway) &#8220;Loose Change 9/11: An American Coup.&#8221; Of course it&#8217;s absolutely loony. In fact, it&#8217;s so loony that I began to wonder if the director, Dylan Avery, wasn&#8217;t having us on. It&#8217;s hard to tell whether &#8220;Loose Change&#8221; is a you&#8217;ve-gotta-hear-this conspiracy theory or a tongue-firmly-in-cheek parody of a conspiracy theory. Maybe I&#8217;m just jaded, but it seems to me&#8211;particularly after reading David Aaronovitch&#8217;s excellent book Voodoo Histories: The Role of Conspiracy Theory in the Shaping of Modern History (Penguin, 2010)&#8211;that we&#8217;ve heard all this before: Satan&#8217;s children did it, the Freemasons did it, the Illuminati did it, the Jews did it, the the Commies did it, the Mafia did it, the John Birch Society did it, the Trilateral Commission did it, the Bilderberg Group did it, the Club of Rome did it, Skull and Bones did it, PNAC did it, and everyone else has done &#8220;it&#8221; whatever &#8220;it&#8221; happens to be.  Every time one of these insidious plots &#8220;comes to light&#8221; it turns out to be a sickly-sweet cocktail of paranoia, anger, and don&#8217;t-let-the-facts-get-in-the-way-of-your-argument speculation. You&#8217;d think we&#8217;d have learned by now not to believe that &#8220;dark, hidden forces&#8221; are behind everything because, well, they demonstrably aren&#8217;t. But people want to believe these things, particularly when they seem to explain why something disturbing&#8211;say, the collapse of Germany in WWI, the high costs of rapid industrialization in the USSR in the 1930s, or America&#8217;s evident lack of preparation for 9/11&#8211;wasn&#8217;t &#8220;our&#8221; fault, but rather someone else&#8217;s. I would like to think that David&#8217;s wonderful book will put an end to loopy conspiracy theories so that we can get on with the important business of fixing things that matter. It probably won&#8217;t, but nonetheless Voodoo History is certainly a fine step in that direction and I applaud David for writing it (and you for reading it).

		<itunes:summary>There&#8217;s a concept I find myself coming back to again and again&#8211;&#8221;speciation.&#8221; It&#8217;s drawn from the vocabulary of evolutionary biology and means, roughly, the process by which new species arise. Speciation occurs when a species must adapt to new circumstances; the more new circumstances, the more new species. Thus one kind of Finch (to take a relevant example) becomes many kinds of Finches when those Finches are compelled to adapt to the circumstances presented by, say, a set of different Islands. To each Island its own Finch. The same process occurs in human history though we don&#8217;t really have a name for it (though &#8220;ethnogenesis&#8221; comes close). When people of one culture spread to many different locales, their cultures &#8220;speciate,&#8221; that is, become adapted to those new locales and thereby differentiate from the &#8220;parent&#8221; culture. This process can be very striking in places places where lots of different locales (however defined) are packed into a tiny geographic area. 
So it is in the Caucasus. Its geography is remarkably diverse, the result being a plethora of what are (to continue the analogy) separate ecological islands. As people moved from island to island, they speciated: their cultures adapted to local conditions and differentiated. To each island its own culture. This is why the Caucasus, though small, is so remarkably complex: it presents huge variety in a small space. And it is this complexity, together with the fact that the Caucusus stands at the nexus of three major empires (the Persian, Turkish, and Russian), that make its story so complicated. There are just a lot of moving parts in the &#8220;system.&#8221; Happily, we have Charles King to help us make sense of it all. In The Ghost of Freedom: A History of the Caucasus (Oxford, 2008), he draws together the many threads of Caucasian history into one rich, dense, though supple cloth. Much of the considerable beauty of this book is found precisely in Charles&#8217; ability to weave many complicated themes into one easy-to-follow story, and all in artful but not arty prose. This is a book you can read. Charles also pays considerable attention to the imaginary Caucusus, that is, the one that lived in the heads of the Persian, Turkish, and Russia imperialists who dominated the place for centuries, and the one that, at least in my case, continues to lead and mislead today. Suffice it to say that what you think you know about the Caucusus, you probably don&#8217;t. So I suggest you pick up this book and let Charles remove the scales from your eyes. It&#8217;s an enjoyable experience.

		<itunes:summary>Hitler caused the Holocaust, that much we know (no Hitler, no Holocaust). But did he directly order it and, if so, how and when? This is one of the many interesting questions posed by Hilary Earl in her outstanding new book The Nuremberg SS-Einsatzgruppen Trial, 1945-1958: Atrocity, Law, and History (Cambridge UP, 2009). The book is about the trial of the leaders of the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile killing units that, in 1941 and 1942, spearheaded the Nazi effort to eradicate the Jewish people. The Einsatzgruppen murdered something on the order of a million people using almost nothing but firearms. In 1947, their commanders were brought to justice in what might be called the &#8220;other&#8221; (forgotten) Nuremberg Trials. The trial left an enormous body of reasonably fresh-after-the-fact testimony for historians to work with in trying to understand this episode in the Holocaust. Hilary does a masterful job of mining this material. She also points out that the roots of our own understanding of the Holocaust can in large measure be traced to these disturbing trials. The defendants were the first Nazi genocidaires to publicly describe what they had done and why they had done it. To be sure, their testimony was self-serving and is therefore suspect. But&#8211;and this is perhaps the most remarkable part&#8211;in many instances it was remarkably accurate. They (and Otto Ohlendorf in particular) &#8220;told it like it was&#8221; because they believed they had not really done anything wrong. Hitler had said that the Jews were the mortal enemies of the Reich; they believed him. Thus when Hitler ordered them to kill the Jews man, woman, and child they were not particularly conflicted&#8211;they were simply following orders, orders they believed to be in the objective interest of Germany. Just how they came to hold this completely irrational view is another, and very interesting, question. For those interested in it, I refer you to Claudia Koonz, The Nazi Conscience (Harvard UP, 2003).
