<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 21, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>It is certainly possible to feel great love for someone with whom you cannot participate in life and, in fact, this is not uncommon.</p>
<p>It is possible to feel great love for someone with whom you are incompatible, even on a personal level.</p>
<p>People make the mistake of trying to build a relationship around this thinking that love is all they really need when, in fact, they are very incompatible with the other person, and their relationship can never be harmonious or really successful.</p>
<p>People think that love is a kind of ultimate state of being, but in terms of romantic love, this cannot be the case.</p>
<p>People treat the experience of being in love as if it is an ultimate experience, but there is no guarantee that this will lead to a successful relationship, for a successful relationship must be built on purpose, readiness and compatibility.</p>
<p>If you are not going in the same direction in life, you will only hold each other up by trying to be together regardless of the attraction initially.</p>
<p>If you cannot take the same journey, then you are interfering with each other’s progress by trying to establish a relationship. This is not uncommon.</p>
<p>In fact, misengaged relationships is one of the primary reasons that people cannot or will not discover their greater purpose for being in the world. They will live a life of compromise, confusion and frustration as a result of this.</p>
<p>Physical attraction, attraction to another’s personality or even attraction to some deeper aspect of the other person, does not mean that you are destined to be together in any way.</p>
<p>Destiny here means everything. If you do not have a real destiny together, then trying to be together will only impede your progress. You actually will be hurting one another by trying to be together. You will be preventing each other from really moving forward in life and finding the people and the purpose that are really essential in being here.</p>
<p>God has sent you into the world for a greater purpose.</p>
<p>This purpose requires the interaction with certain individuals along the way and eventually with certain others who will play a major part in your realization and expression of this greater purpose.</p>
<p>Trying to unite with other people for other reasons will only interfere with this essential process in life, and the results lead to prolonged unhappiness, confusion and compromise.</p>
<p>This is such a great problem. Many people are circumscribed by the relationships that they have established before they have reached a point in life where they could discover their greater purpose.</p>
<p>As a result, they are trapped. They have committed their life already. They have given their life away. And now they are afraid to question their former commitments and previous investment in other people.</p>
<p>They will try to seek comfort by pursuing wealth or through distractions or hobbies or religious pursuits or political pursuits. But essentially their problem has to do with where they are in life and who they are with.</p>
<p>If you are with someone who cannot recognize your greater purpose and deeper nature, they are going to hold you back, and you will feel held back and frustrated regardless of whatever pleasures or affluence you have created together.</p>
<p>Look at the faces of the people, and you will see this compromise. You will see this lack of freedom. You will see this inability to engage with their deeper nature and all the great powers and significance that this represents.</p>
<p>People give their life away before they even know they have a life—a greater life, a life with a greater purpose, meaning and destiny.</p>
<p>For anyone who is called by God, this problem of previous commitments is a very serious one indeed and can prevent the one blessed to receive from responding. They are already dishonest with themselves regarding their current relationships, commitments and obligations. And they will find that they are having great difficulty responding to a greater calling, which is always mysterious and which exists beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect.</p>
<p>If you feel love for someone, then feel it, but do not give it a form.</p>
<p>Observe the situation and see if this is correct, if this person really understands your deeper nature and is going where you are going and is called as you are being called. Or are they just a wonderful person with wonderful qualities that you are attracted to?</p>
<p>There is a world of difference between these two evaluations and the results and consequences that they lead to.</p>
<p>Who you are with will determine what you are able to know and your ability to follow what you know, to follow the greater Knowledge that God has given you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your greater accomplishments in life.</p>
<p>One misaligned or misappropriated relationship can stand in the way of this discovery and expression. This you must realize.</p>
<p>You must take your relationships very seriously. You cannot afford to be with people who are not going where you are going and who cannot respond to the power of Knowledge within themselves.</p>
<p>Face the disappointment that this realization may bring about. But face the truth. For the truth is very clear in these matters even though people are very confused.</p>
<p>Knowledge within you will recognize those individuals who are going to be significant. The question then is are they ready to participate? Are they mentally and physically healthy enough to participate? Are they ready, willing and able to participate?</p>
<p>This brings up the question of readiness, which is very important, for many people who do have a greater calling and are close to receiving this calling are really not ready for it at all.</p>
<p>They have given their life away to other things. They are not living the life they were meant to live. They are with people who cannot respond to the greater truth and direction in their lives. The compromises they have had to make to maintain these involvements have cost them a great deal.</p>
<p>Readiness is very important. In a sense, everyone is not ready until they are ready, until they have cleared their life, until they have faced their mistakes from the past, until they have let go of what they have created if it is standing in their way, until they have reached a deeper level of self-honesty where they can feel the movement and the restraint of Knowledge within themselves.</p>
<p>Even if you were to recognize someone who is going to play a significant role, your readiness for them and their readiness for you is very important.</p>
<p>This readiness also requires that you not assign a form to your relationship. This person may become a real ally. They may become a teacher or a student. They may become part of your essential core community. But that does not mean they are going to be your husband or your wife, even if they appear to be a candidate for this role.</p>
<p>Here your personal desires and needs must be recognized and managed correctly, or you will make critical errors regarding the very person you are meant to be with. and the results will destroy your participation together, which will have serious consequences for both of you.</p>
<p>Next is the question of compatibility, and this has a great deal to do with the success of a marriage or a deeper union with another.</p>
<p>For a person who is meant to be your ally or to work with you in your core community or to be a part of your mission and purpose in the world, compatibility is important, but not to the extent that it is important for someone who is going to be a life partner or your husband or your wife.<br />
Compatibility here determines whether you can function successfully together, whether you have the right ingredients for this kind of relationship.</p>
<p>People do not use this criteria at the outset, only to find out later that their chosen partner is really very different from them in ways that are quite consequential, and there are parts of their life they cannot share—deeper parts, essential parts, even the most essential parts.</p>
<p>This must be the criteria, and the New Message presents the criteria very clearly in teaching you about the Four Pillars of your life—the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Spiritual Development. Like the four legs of a table, they uphold your life, and the extent to which they are successfully built will determine whether you are ready or not to receive your greater calling and purpose in the world.</p>
<p>If these Pillars are frail or fragile, then you will collapse under the weight of a greater set of responsibilities in life. That is why a central part of your studenthood in learning the New Message is to build these Pillars, which is a very mundane activity for most people.</p>
<p>If you are not properly engaged with other people, then you must work on this, and that represents your Pillar of Relationships. If your work or use of finances is not correct, that is a Pillar you must work on. If your health is weak or has been neglected or faces serious problems, you must deal with this on both a mental and a physical level. This constitutes a great deal of the work of preparing yourself for a greater purpose in life.</p>
<p>People who do not do this work will fail, and their failure will be very consequential for them and for others who are meant to be with them.</p>
<p>This is one of the chief causes of human failure—the failure to respond, the failure to follow what must be followed, the failure to understand the nature of the journey you are on and what you must do at every great turning point along the way.</p>
<p>Clearly, this narrows the field of choices for who you would choose to be with in life, for there must be purpose, there must be readiness and there must be this greater compatibility.</p>
<p>So what role does passionate love make in all of this? Passionate love is like a flame that burns very hot, but that cannot burn for very long. It is based on fear, hope and fantasy. It is imbued with desire, and it reinforces personal insecurity and personal neediness.</p>
<p>This is the love experience that so many people are pursuing in life at great expense, but it is not an experience that can lead to a really successful relationship in most cases.</p>
<p>What you are looking for is an experience of recognition—a deep, quiet, powerful experience. It is not highly emotional. It is not fraught with fear. anxiety and uncertainty. It is coming from a deeper place within you. It is Knowledge recognizing another.</p>
<p>This is very different from the experience of falling in love, which is really entering a kind of pathetic, unknowing state, filled with desire, fear and uncertainty.</p>
<p>If this is your experience with another, then you must proceed very slowly and cautiously, for you are prone to make serious mistakes in this state of mind.</p>
<p>Do not commit yourself. Do not give your life away. Be observant and listen carefully within yourself as you proceed.</p>
<p>Go to Knowledge and ask, “Is this the person I should be with?”If Knowledge is quiet, if Knowledge does not respond, then you must be very careful and consider if you are making a serious mistake in this matter.</p>
<p>This is the level of honesty and sobriety you must have regarding human relationships.</p>
<p>If you will practice this, you will avoid the calamitous mistakes that people are making continuously around you, and you will, through time and through your own preparation find the key individuals that will make all the difference in the quality and the meaning of your life.</p>
<p>This produces a greater love, a deeper love, an enduring love, a love based upon participation together, upon service to one another, upon courage and commitment.</p>
<p>It is not a passionate flame that burns hot and then fades away. It is a deeper fire that burns continuously. At times of success and at times of failure and disappointment in life, it is still there.</p>
<p>As you grow with another, this love becomes stronger, more powerful and more consistent. It does not come and go. It is not lost in the moment. Even if you are upset with the other person, the love is still there because it is at a deeper level.</p>
<p>It is not a fascination of the mind. It is not based upon emotion alone. It is not something that is here today and gone tomorrow. It is not something that is extinguished as you begin to face the challenges and difficulties of life together.</p>
<p>People are impatient. Their culture encourages them to get married at an early age. All the symbolism encourages passionate love affairs and all the excitement that seems to go along with it.</p>
<p>People are caught up in this pursuit over romance. They do not see that they are gambling with their existence. They do not see that they are neglecting the deeper Knowledge and recognition that will enable them to choose wisely and make the right choice.</p>
<p>God is not denying you relationships with others. God is preparing you for the right relationships, the ones that will make all the difference, the ones that will bring forth the power of Knowledge within yourself, the ones that will encourage you to discover your deeper nature and with it your greater purpose for being in the world.</p>
<p>This is not the stuff of movies and novels and the romantic stories of passion and agony, all that foolishness.</p>
<p>Who you are with will determine what you can know and your ability to follow what you know. This means that who you are with will determine whether you can really be honest with yourself and whether you can recognize your true opportunities in life and have the courage and strength to follow them. Who you are with will determine whether you will discover your greater purpose and whether you can express it and prepare for it accordingly.</p>
<p>Do not hide behind love as a kind of excuse for being in a relationship where you have no purpose and destiny.</p>
<p>Do not think that you can create your purpose and destiny with another, for We are speaking of something innate within you, something you did not create, something that was created for you and that has everything to do with who you are and why you are in the world at this time.</p>
<p>You may feel you have destiny with another, but you must see if you are truly compatible. You must move very slowly and not commit yourself. You must see if the other person is really ready, if they are really responding to a deeper calling, and if they can recognize it in you. Or are you just an attractive person, attracting them for the moment. Are you merely a pastime for them, an indulgence, a temporary involvement?</p>
<p>You must be very serious in these matters, for romance is a fool’s paradise with tragic results.</p>
<p>You must be very careful with where you commit yourself and your life. Real love will emerge with those with whom you share a real destiny, who are ready to participate and have sufficient compatibility with you for you to take on greater parameters and opportunities in life.</p>
<p>Real love is a product of honest and true engagement.</p>
<p>This is the love that endures. This is the love that is true. This is the love that is lasting. This is the love that will carry you through your life and remind you that you are here for a greater purpose. This is the love that will make that purpose real and available to you.</p>
<p>Here there is real love, and there is false love.</p>
<p>There is real relationship, and there is false relationship.</p>
<p>There is honest love; there is dishonest love.</p>
<p>There are honest relationships; there are dishonest relationships.</p>
<p>People unite because they want pleasure or security or they are enamored with another person’s appearance or personality. They want to escape with someone. They want to escape loneliness. They want to escape facing their own life. They want to escape the greater calling within themselves. They want to escape.</p>
<p>But there is nothing there if that is your purpose. You are running from yourself. You do not realize you have a core relationship with Knowledge, the deeper intelligence that God has created within you and for you.</p>
<p>You are not utilizing your time alone appropriately, to build the Four Pillars of your life and to begin to take the Steps to Knowledge that are presented for you.</p>
<p>You must become the person you are meant to be before you can be in a relationship successfully, a deep harmonious relationship, a greater partnership. You bring to that what you have discovered within yourself. If this discovery has not really occurred or has not occurred sufficiently, then what is a relationship for you but a huge and expensive distraction, an alternative from your core responsibilities?</p>
<p>You must have a sense of who you are and where you are going in life based upon Knowledge before you can know who to be with and how to be with them.</p>
<p>This is the restraint that must be practiced if you are to achieve greater things in life. Here you hold yourself back when everyone around you is giving themselves away. Here you practice discernment and objectivity while others want to lose themselves in their passions and indulgences.</p>
<p>This restraint will give you power and wisdom and will liberate you and free you from making critical and consequential mistakes.</p>
<p>You have a destiny with certain people. You cannot bring them into your life when you want them. They will come when they come. You may be open to them. You may even call for them, but you must wait. You must be very clear and discerning regarding all your other attractions in life.</p>
<p>Do not criticize or condemn yourself for having these attractions. They are part of the problem of living in Separation. They are an attempt to overcome Separation. But they are not guided by Knowledge. They are not really true and honest, so even your desire to overcome Separation must be guided by the Greater Power that God has given you, for only this can end Separation within yourself and between yourself and others.</p>
<p>In this, God has the answer to your most fundamental and essential questions about life. But you must be patient and take the Steps to Knowledge and hold yourself back regarding other people.</p>
<p>As you gain a greater sense of your own nature and the meaning of your own calling, you will not want to give yourself away. You will see the hazard of doing this, and you will see the tragedy of other people doing this and the empty relationships that this creates.</p>
<p>Seek the greater love. Seek the true love. Seek the real relationships. But to do this, you must prepare, for you are not ready at this moment regardless of your desires and needs.</p>
<p>You must build the Four Pillars of your life. You must become strong and stable. You must address your weaknesses and learn to manage them effectively. You must bring forth your strengths.</p>
<p>It is a tremendous amount of work to build the foundation for a greater life.</p>
<p>Instead of chasing romance, fantasies and distractions, young people must be engaged in this greater building if they are to have anything but a mundane and meaningless life.</p>
<p>There must be faith that the true people you need will come to you when you are ready. It is a matter of confidence. It is also a matter of honesty because if you are really honest, you will see that your life is not strong enough or stable enough to really engage with another at a deeper level.</p>
<p>You do not know enough about yourself. You have not corrected your mistakes. You have not freed yourself from your former engagements with others or your addictions. You are not clear enough.</p>
<p>You must have the honesty to see this and then you will not feel that life is holding back. You will be holding yourself back. You will say, “I’m really not ready for a relationship of this nature.”</p>
<p>It will be an honest evaluation, and though you might feel a sense of loss in the moment, Knowledge within you will become stronger, and you will feel happy and glad that you are not betraying this.</p>
<p>There is a turning point here, where the attraction of Knowledge, the power of Knowledge and the sense of wholeness and rightness about your life that accompanies the experience of Knowledge become more important than having all your needs met and trying to validate yourself or win the approval of others.</p>
<p>You are to reach this point of integrity, honesty and clarity. That is your job. That is what the New Message calls for. And that is why it presents the Steps to Knowledge.</p>
<p>You are here for a greater purpose, but you are not ready. You are not ready for that purpose. You are not ready for the people who will be essential for that purpose.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you must build the Four Pillars of your life, build your connection to Knowledge and learn to become truly honest with yourself regarding your decisions, your attractions and your priorities.</p>

<p><em>Received by the Messenger Marshall Vian Summers on May 14, 2011 in Boulder, Colorado</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #373737; font-family: georgia; font-size: 22px;">God’s New Revelation is not here to simply add value to your current existence or to validate your current ideas and pursuits. It is not here to validate the world’s religions or to conform to their beliefs or expectations, for God is not bound by these things. It is not here to validate your expectations, for the Creator of all the universes is certainly not bound by this.</span></p>
<p>Really, the New Message from God is here to provide a new life to those who can truly respond to it, to give them a greater foundation upon which to build a meaningful life—an inspired life, a life that is guided by Knowledge, a life of true relationships and meaningful engagement with the world.</p>
<p>Here roles are not assigned, but people are given the foundation so that Knowledge within them, the Greater Power that God has given to guide them, may become evident to them, that they may learn through time to trust this and to follow this, navigating the difficulties of life and the greater difficulties they will have to face in a new world of diminishing resources and greater instability.</p>
<p>People come to the New Message to see if it conforms to their beliefs, their ideas and their expectations. Of course, it does not do this.</p>
<p>People come to the New Message from God wanting to use it as a resource to get what they want for themselves, but the New Revelation has a greater plan and promise for them.</p>
<p>People come to the New Message hoping that they will find the wisdom necessary to correct their mistakes and to make their current investments profitable and meaningful, but the New Message is here to give them a new life—not simply a new idea put upon an old life, not simply a sweetener to make the bitter taste of their current experience more palatable and acceptable. People expect too little and want too little, and their expectations are not in keeping with the meaning and the power of the Revelation.</p>
<p>People come to God’s New Revelation wanting to see how they can use it right away, as if it is nothing more than a series of tools that people could use to try to improve their lives. But they cannot improve their lives because they do not know what they are doing. They do not know where they are going, and their assumptions and beliefs, more often than not, are not in keeping with their greater purpose and true direction in life.</p>
<p>People may think God is great and inexplicable, but they try to use God as a kind of servant, an errand boy for their desires, their wishes and their difficulties. They say, “Well, what can God do for me? What will God’s New Revelation do for me?”</p>
<p>You can see by this questioning that their attitude and approach is not appropriate. There is no reverence. There is no respect. There is no comprehension that they are dealing with something far greater than their understanding, that far exceeds their expectations, their values and their preferences. So what can God do for them but encourage them through life’s changes and life’s disappointments to come to this great engagement with a clearer intention and a more honest approach?</p>
<p>The New Message is here to save humanity from calamity and from subjugation in the universe as you begin to emerge into a Greater Community of life, a Greater Community in which you have always lived and with which you must now learn to contend.</p>
<p>But it is also here to give individuals a new experience, a new foundation and the opportunity to restore their lives, to redeem themselves and to utilize their abilities and the power of Knowledge within themselves to be of service to a world whose needs and difficulties are escalating with each passing day.</p>
<p>Many people have given up on the search for greater meaning, or they never cultivated it to begin with. For them, the New Revelation will be a curiosity or an object of condemnation, something upon which they can project their fears, their judgments and their grievances without ever really understanding what they are looking at.</p>
<p>There will be all manner of response to this, of course, but it is important for those who are coming to this with an honest intention and with humility and sincerity to realize the power and the potency of God’s Revelation and what it can mean for them—to restore them, to give them a greater purpose and direction, which already live within them.</p>
<p>You do not invent purpose and direction, for it is built in, you see. It is part of the blueprint of your deeper nature, beyond the realm of the intellect. Beyond debate and speculation, this is. You can argue with it forever, but it just means that you do not understand.</p>
<p>It is important that people who come to the Revelation sincerely, that they have an understanding at the outset that they are dealing with something of a greater magnitude. It is not a mere teaching among other teachings. It is not simply a promising thing that will give them what they want in life. It is a whole other level altogether. That is why it is a New Message from God, the only Message from God in the world today.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the New Message is going to craft a new life for you and give you a role to play, for that must come from within you—between you and yourself, between you and your engagement with life.</p>
<p>Many people will need the New Message to be the center of their practice and focus, and some people will be called to serve the New Message directly because that is their calling. But for many others, it will give them the strength to discern a greater direction and to give them a greater internal power and strength to make the necessary decisions and to turn the corners that must be turned to begin to move in a positive and meaningful direction.</p>
<p>There are many people in the world today who know they must prepare for something, who feel called to a greater participation, who have a sense that their life is more important than the mundane activities of the day. Some will not find their way in the religious traditions of the world because they are being prepared and called for something new in the world. They are more connected to the future than the past, and the future is calling them and pulling them forward.</p>
<p>There are people destined to receive God’s Revelation and to study it and to apply it. They are not going to find their way anywhere else. If you are destined for something of this magnitude, you will not find satisfaction and fulfillment anywhere else—try as you may, believe as hard as you can believe. Try to alter your life like a tyrant, you still cannot make the primary engagement unless your life is pointed in the right direction and the nature of engagement that is meant for you can be clearly discerned and accepted.</p>
<p>It is for these people that the Revelation will provide a new life, not simply an enhancement of their old life, not simply a justification for what they have done or not done in the past. It is not simply a comfort to tell them, “Well, you are all right. What you have done is all right. It is okay.”</p>
<p>No. The Revelation will make your errors more glaring, your disappointments more apparent, your lack of direction more deeply felt. It may even increase your suffering at the outset until you can discern the real gift of Revelation and recognize that you are beginning a greater journey now, perhaps a journey that you have been on for some time that is now taking a great step forward.</p>
<p>Here there is no room for compromise. You cannot make a deal with God. You cannot make a deal with your own purpose and destiny, for you cannot change these things. You can only avoid them, deny them or go through the process of accepting them and claiming them.</p>
<p>How your purpose will be expressed depends upon the changing circumstances of the world. So in this not all things are pre-determined, certainly not. Your success or failure is not only based upon your participation, but on the participation and readiness of others who are destined to play a significant role in your life. If they fail in this, it will affect the outcome for you, for your progress is dependent upon the development of certain other people.</p>
<p>This is not an individual pursuit where you try to enlighten yourself individually. It is a joining and a union with others for a greater purpose. If they fail, it will affect the outcome for you. If you fail, it will affect the outcome for them. That is why failure here has such great consequence. You are still thinking as if you are living in separation, so you cannot see that your destiny is tied with others.</p>
<p>These are others who you will have to find in life. They will not be the charming personalities and the beautiful faces and the gracious social behavior that draw so many people. They will not even be people who you could love or for whom you have some past association. Most of those people will not share your future even if you have had a distant past association with them. You will need Knowledge now, for it alone within you will know. It will see. It will respond.</p>
<p>If that other person is not ready, well, it will be a tragedy for you. That does not mean your life is over. It just means that another plan will have to be established for you. Your journey will be longer and more uncertain as a result.</p>
<p>There is so much to unlearn. There is so much conditioning that is not only counterproductive but actually destructive to the individual. There is so much driving expectation that leads you to commit yourself before you even know what you are doing in life, before you have made a connection in Knowledge, which alone holds for you your greater purpose and destiny.</p>
<p>God would never reveal these things to the intellect, a part of your mind that is conditioned by the world and is so unreliable and so weak and so easily persuaded by other forces. No, the gift is given to a deeper part of you that is not influenced by the world, that is not influenced by your changing feelings and attitudes, your shifting emotions, your hope, your fear, your ecstasy, your destitution—not affected by any of this. It is living deep in the ocean, not on the turbulent surface.</p>
<p>Taking the Steps to Knowledge then becomes essential, or your life will continue to be a vain pursuit—chasing people, chasing promises, chasing ambition, chasing dreams, chasing hope, running away from fear in all cases, terrified that you may be lost and alone, terrified that your life will never come together.</p>
<p>Knowledge exists beyond the realm of desire and fear, and that is why it is sound. That is why it is strong. That is why it is unchanging, and you cannot change it. This, however, represents your redemption. No matter what you think or do or have done or have not done, the power of redemption lives within you.</p>
<p>God does not have to figure out your situation. The Lord of the universe is not focused on your life. But God has put Knowledge within you, and it holds your purpose and direction. It will find the people you must find. It will bring correction, harmony and balance to your life if you are able to discern it and to follow it and to apply it, wherever that is necessary.</p>
<p>This is what creates a new life—not an old life with a few enhancements; not an old life with a new belief system; not an old life with a new set of clothes or a fancy religious explanation for everything; not a tragic person dressed up for success; not a lonely, isolated person who has now become socially acceptable because you say and do all the right things.</p>
<p>You are not simply a billboard for someone else’s beliefs. There is a greater promise for you. God cares for you because God is providing you a new life. Otherwise, God would let everyone falter and fail and would not be concerned. This is what people actually believe because if you think God’s Revelations were given centuries ago and God has nothing else to say to humanity, then you must conclude that God really does not care and has nothing more to say as humanity faces thresholds now, collectively, that it has never had to face before.</p>
<p>How will you deal with a declining world? How will you deal with intervention from predatory races from the universe who are here to take advantage of human weakness and division? How will you deal with political and economic upheaval on a scale never seen before in the world?</p>
<p>If you are honest with yourself, you will have to admit eventually that you do not even have a clue. Yet this is the condition of the world and what you will have to face and everyone with you.</p>
<p>God is sending a preparation for the New World as part of the New Message. God is sending you the plans and the preparation to begin to establish a new life. There is the Message for the world and everyone in it. Then there is the Message for the individual who feels that they have a greater purpose and destiny in the world. You will have to decide if this speaks to you.</p>
<p>God did not invent your ideas and beliefs. God did not create your preferences and your fears. God did not create the world that is a product of everyone’s preferences and fears. You cannot blame God for the social conditions of humanity. You cannot blame God for wars and cruelty, exploitation, slavery and poverty. That is all a human creation based upon greed and ignorance, based upon not enough people contributing enough to the world around them.</p>
<p>But God did create the presence of Knowledge within you, and only God’s New Revelation makes this very clear, without an overlay of history and human interpretation to cloud your understanding. The stream is clear. The Message is pure. You are receiving it from its Source, instead of an interpretation that was made centuries later for human consumption.</p>
<p>To have a new life, you must do the work. It is not a spell that is put upon you. It is not taking some magic potion and having everything be different. It is not a form of addiction or intoxication.</p>
<p>You will have to do the work. You will have to take the risks. You will have to make the decisions. You will have to disappoint other people. You will have to disappoint your own goals and ambitions. You will have to change your plans.</p>
<p>This is where you become strong. This is where you become united within yourself. This is where you follow one voice instead of many voices in your mind. This is where your true allegiance emerges amongst your other commitments and obligations. This is where you reclaim your strength and your self-confidence. This is where you stop behaving foolishly, giving your life away to silly and meaningless things. This is where you know who to choose to be with and how to resist the temptations that lead you elsewhere in life.</p>
<p>You become strong because Knowledge is within you. You endure difficulty because Knowledge is within you. You can face pain and loss, illness and even rejection from others you care about because the power of Knowledge is within you. And when you meet another who has developed this power, your relationship will be on a whole other level—extraordinary in the world, able to create far greater things than you alone could ever produce.</p>
<p>God gives you the source of your strength, but you must exercise its guidance, and you must develop the personal skills that allow you to become a vehicle for Knowledge—a person of power and integrity, a person who can inspire others and can bring confidence, comfort and direction to others.</p>
<p>This is God’s New Revelation. This is what it is meant to produce. There must be many strong contributors in the world now, or humanity faces a great and precipitous decline.</p>
<p>Let this be your understanding.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on June 24, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>The Messenger is in the world. He has brought with him a great Message for humanity, a Message that he has been receiving for over 25 years, a Message comprehensive enough to guide humanity into the next great stage of its evolution and development.</p>
<p>Yet he is an ordinary man, but in appearance only. For he carries with him the seed of a greater understanding and a Greater Reality—the reality of life in the universe; the reality of a greater spiritual dimension of the world and beyond; the reality of purpose, meaning and direction; the reality of contact with the Angelic Presence, who is responsible for the well-being and the progress of the human family.</p>
<p>Many people will try to reject him. Many people will condemn him or ridicule him. Who will stand up for him? Who amongst you will bear witness to the Revelation? Who amongst you is strong enough, brave enough and honest enough to do this?</p>
<p>The Messenger’s presence is precious in the world. He is vulnerable. There will be other groups and individuals who will seek to destroy him as his Proclamation becomes more recognized and more discernible in the world.</p>
<p>Who will bear witness to the Revelation?</p>
<p>People want many things from the Creator of all life. And people will want many things from the Messenger who has been sent, the only Messenger in the world today and in the many days to come.</p>
<p>People want miracles. People want to be rescued from their circumstances. People want to be given favors and dispensations. People want to be served. People want to be strengthened. People want victory in war and prosperity in peace.</p>
<p>They will bring these expectations to the Messenger, particularly to him. But he can only point the way to the Revelation, which is deeper and more comprehensive than most people realize and will require a greater involvement and discernment, a greater practice and honest application.</p>
<p>Who can speak to this? Who can correct the many errors that will arise around such a proclamation? Even amongst those who respond positively, there will be false expectations. There will be unexpressed demands. There will be criticisms and judgments that the Message and the Messenger do not fit people’s expectations. Who will speak to this?</p>
<p>The Message and the Messenger require many witnesses. They require a great expression of recognition and purpose. For those for whom this is their destiny, it is the most important thing in their whole life. When they leave this world and return to their Spiritual Family, they will be asked, “Did you speak for the Messenger? Did you recognize the Messenger? Did you support the Messenger?”</p>
<p>It will be the greatest and most significant event and opportunity in their life. Who can respond to this? Who can recognize this? Who can rise to this occasion, the greatest occasion that they will have?</p>
<p>People want many things, but what is required of them is something else. At a time of Revelation, the priorities change. This is an event that only happens every millennium, and you are present in the world for this.</p>
<p>You will see the Messenger being abused and ridiculed and maligned. What will that say to you, who are the beneficiaries of God’s New Revelation? What will that evoke in you, who have been blessed and honored to receive the New Message for humanity and to be amongst its first and earliest recipients?</p>
<p>If you cannot feel and see these things We speak of, then where is your mind going? What could be more important than this to you? Your happiness? Your security? Your approval from others? Your social standing? This is a question and a dilemma for each person who can respond.</p>
<p>If those who oppose the Messenger come to you and say, “What do you believe? What is your position?” what will you say to this? If the Messenger is denied or ignored or vilified, what will you say to this?</p>
<p>People are eager to receive the blessings and the benefits of Revelation, but these benefits bring with them a responsibility, the ability to respond. They call forth for you to be a witness and not merely a recipient—practicing alone in secret, hidden away somewhere out in the world.</p>
<p>Who will speak for the Revelation when the challenges come? Who will speak when there is a backlash against the Message and the Messenger and those who seem so respectable and august in society condemn the one chosen to bring God’s Revelation into the world?</p>
<p>How will you feel and what will you think when you see those whom you admire, those whom you respect, when they turn against the Revelation? Will that throw you into doubt and confusion? Will that make you feel impotent and hopeless?</p>
<p>Look back in history. Have any of the great Messengers ever been embraced in their own time or comprehended successfully by those who were close to them?</p>
<p>If the Messenger were to assume political power, oh, certainly there would be many allegiances. Oh, certainly, there would be many arrangements. Oh, certainly, many would seem to follow, desiring to be on the winning side of the conflict. Oh, yes, many would arrive, praising and giving recognition to the Messenger, for they seek to benefit from his presence and his position. Oh, yes, the loyal ministers would appear. Oh, yes, the people would be aroused and enthusiastic.</p>
<p>And what is this to the Messenger, to have a great following of people who do not understand, whose expectations are incorrect, whose allegiances are dishonest, whose respect and adulation are false and easily destroyed by others? Who will bear witness based upon the strength of Knowledge, the deeper intelligence within them?</p>
<p>In these earlier stages of the Proclamation, the Messenger will be ignored. He will be condemned outright, harshly criticized—called a devil, called a fool, called a manipulator, called a whole host of things by those who cannot or will not respond, condemned by those who only seek to preserve and protect their current position and their previous investments, those who will not have the courage to question their allegiances, their beliefs or assumptions.</p>
<p>And, oh, the experts will fare no better, those who have invested themselves so heavily and have paid such prices and made so many compromises to acquire their position of authority in society. Will they risk all of this to recognize a man who has little recognition, a man who has but a very small following, a man whose Message seems outrageous and whose proclamations stir rejection and resentment?</p>
<p>Will these experts risk their reputation, their social position, their employment, to bear witness to the Revelation? Will any politician risk all that they have invested in—their standing, their achievements—to recognize the Messenger?</p>
<p>No, you see, this burden falls upon you and others, many others. Do not look for the elite or the highly respectable to risk their position to bear witness to the Revelation. Do not think that the Messenger only needs to be connected with certain powerful people, for you will be playing the Judas role here—well intentioned, perhaps, but blind to the reality of the situation.</p>
<p>The Messenger holds the key to humanity’s future and future success. Who will bear witness to this? Who will hold this position, a position that the world does not esteem or recognize?</p>
<p>Many people will come, wanting many things. There will be nodding heads and smiling faces, but who will bear witness to this?</p>
<p>You who seek purpose and meaning in your life must come to understand that this is what it ultimately means—that you must stand for something greater than yourself, greater than your personal interests or advantages, greater than your own private inurement. You must stand for something greater in the face of opposition, in the face of ignorance and foolishness and rejection.</p>
<p>This will call you out of the shadows. This will call you out of self-denial. This will call others forth from their miserable, hidden existence. This will bring people out of their low self-esteem. This will bring people out of their self-doubt and self-repudiation, called now to be a witness to something greater, something magnificent, something deep and efficacious, something that humanity needs but cannot provide for itself.</p>
<p>For all who can receive the blessings of the Creator now, they will have to face these questions, eventually. They cannot simply be on the receiving end—wanting more, expecting more, giving thanks and being grateful—for they too must rise to a position of self-expression. They too must advocate for that which is serving them so greatly. They too must risk their own fears and self-doubts to make a greater expression to others. They too must face social rejection.</p>
<p>It is the nature of their calling. There is no calling or purpose that does not involve some of these things. You do not simply proclaim a purpose for yourself and live happily ever after. You do not simply respond to your calling and have everything going your way.</p>
<p>To serve the world, you must confront the world. You must have the courage to face the world and its realities. You must build the strength within yourself to do this and to provide something the world cannot provide for itself, something that is needed that is not available, something that other people cannot do or will not do. Do not defer to others here, for it is you who are being called.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of calling—purpose and calling. To be called is to be called out of the ordinary, out of the crowded places, out of what everyone else is doing, thinking and concerned with, to step out of line, to be called away from your normal life sufficiently that you can receive a greater wisdom and revelation.</p>
<p>What is higher purpose but to assume something greater than your normal activities and to serve something beyond your own self-interests and personal edification? Responding to the Revelation then is a perfect demonstration of these things.</p>
<p>For those who cannot or will not bear witness to the Revelation, either they do not yet have the great strength that they need and are not strong enough with Knowledge, or they are too afraid to cross over that threshold where they become a real communicator in the world rather than someone who has withdrawn from the world and is afraid of the world and is trying to protect what they have from the world.</p>
<p>Not everyone is ready to do this at this moment, but that is where the pathway leads for everyone. You have to stand for something. And your demonstration must be real and not merely psychological. It must be palpable and not merely at the level of thought. You will have to make sacrifices for it. You will have to give up things for it. You will have to risk things for it. And this is what separates those whose calling is true and powerful from those who are either pretending or are too weak to respond fully.</p>
<p>The Messenger is in the world. Who will bear witness to him, based upon the strength of their recognition? Who will take chances to speak to others? Who will allow their life to be reshaped by Knowledge, allow their priorities to change naturally, allow their thinking to become uniform, powerful and penetrating? Who will allow their life to be changed and altered and go through those periods of uncertainty that this will require along the way?</p>
<p>Certainly not the person who must feel that they must be in control at all times, whose certainty is based upon the strength of their convictions and ideas and the rigidity of their lives. They do not have the confidence or the self-trust to undergo any real process of preparation, which will take them into uncertainty and break up their false and harmful regimentation.</p>
<p>The self-seeking will not do this, for it puts at risk the things they are trying to acquire for themselves. They will try to use God’s Revelation to enrich themselves politically, socially, economically, even spiritually. But they will not become true advocates. They will not bear witness to the Messenger because they want everyone to bear witness to them.</p>
<p>This is not the Messenger’s desire or intention, to be the object of so much attention and focus. He is a humble man. He does not seek such recognition, and that is part of why he was chosen to be God’s representative in this era of humanity’s development.</p>
<p>The ambitious and the self-serving are never chosen, for they are not trustworthy. They do not have the self-awareness or the self-honesty to assume a greater responsibility. Humility is a product of honesty and compassion, two things which the self-serving have not yet achieved.</p>
<p>Must the Messenger be sacrificed at the hands of the opposition while his true followers remain mute, silent and impotent? Will the New Revelation be desecrated and repudiated while those who are chosen to be its witnesses remain silent and withdrawn, afraid for themselves?</p>
<p>To think the Messenger can communicate everything and answer everything is to place an impossible burden upon him, for he must have many witnesses in many places. And they must be careful if they are living in countries where there is political or religious repression. They must exercise great discernment and discretion where and when to share the Revelation.</p>
<p>Martyrdom here is not the emphasis. It is communication. It is relationship. It is spreading the Revelation—above ground or underground, depending upon the political, social and religious environment in which one lives.</p>
<p>But the communication and the relationship must be extended and expanded. It is not enough to be a fervent believer, for that must translate into action, not only in renewing and reviewing one’s life, but also to becoming a witness for that which is the source of one’s remarkable restoration.</p>
<p>This will separate the true respondents from others who are here for other reasons or who are too weak to rise above their own self-concern.</p>
<p>Let this be the basis of your understanding of others who respond. It is what they do that matters, not what they say or what they proclaim in the moment. Will they allow their lives to really be changed, altered and reshaped by the Revelation and by the power of Knowledge within themselves? Will they bear witness to the Messenger as an act of spontaneous and natural contribution? Or will they remain in the background, plotting and planning for how they can benefit without having to pay any prices or take any risks?</p>
<p>This is part of the burden of the Messenger, for even amongst those who seem to respond positively, there are still dangers. The one who will betray the Messenger will come from the ranks of his supporters. The disaffected or failed student, rather than taking responsibility for their own difficulties and limitations, will seek to deny or to diminish the Message and the Messenger. This always happens at times of Revelation. You will see this happening.</p>
<p>Your response to the Revelation is a response to life and to the Source of life. It reveals both your strengths and your weaknesses. It shows you those influences in your life which are helpful and those which are harmful, for in the face of the Revelation, there is no neutral ground. This polarizes people, as it should, as it must, because there must be impact. To the person who seems unaffected or disinterested, well, that is not a neutral position.</p>
<p>Think of the person who failed to respond in the time of great Messengers in the past. What were they thinking? How could it be they could not see what was before them? How could it be they could not recognize the one who brought to them the promise of a greater life? How could it be that they would stand by and allow the Message and the Messenger to be denigrated?</p>
<p>Either their neutrality is an expression of immense cowardice, or they are dead to themselves and the world and cannot respond. They cannot be responsible, for they are unable to respond.</p>
<p>The Messenger must proclaim the New Message and must identify that which is destroying human civilization and humanity’s future and freedom. Much of what he will say will be very challenging. It will make you uncomfortable because that is what Revelation does; it makes you uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Revelation brings both confirmation and discomfort because it requires you to change. It requires you to reconsider your life, your commitments and your activities. It is a challenge, not just a consolation.</p>
<p>The pressure is on the recipient, not to respond immediately, but to respond. How they will respond will say everything about their circumstances, their state of mind and how they value themselves.</p>
<p>Let there be many witnesses to the Message and the Messenger. Let there be many who can respond and receive the gift of preparation and bring it into their life with real determination and compassion.</p>
<p>Let the world hear what the Revelation has to say. Let them hear the Voice of Revelation. Let them respond to the Messenger in any way they can.</p>
<p>Be a vehicle for this, and your life will be justified, your purpose fulfilled, and the fruits of all your suffering and achievements will have the greatest meaning and the greatest value to the world.</p>

<p id="date">As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on January 26, 2008<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p><!--audio space-->It is important in understanding the nature of the New Revelation that it was given to someone who was sent into the world for the purpose of receiving it. He is a man. He is not perfect. He is not magnificent according to people’s expectations, but he is the one destined to receive the New Message, and his life has been orchestrated to make this possible. He has been guided to prepare for this for a very long time without really knowing what it was for. And he had to prove himself without realizing that he was proving himself for something very significant. He had to pass tests without knowing the nature of those tests nor the meaning of success and failure.</p>
<p>Born into a conventional family, educated at the university, he showed few signs of the greatness of his future life. However, the restraint he felt from committing himself to any kind of specialized career, the restraint he had to exercise regarding his relationships with others and his commitment to things in the world was with him from the start. His journey is inexplicable to anyone living in the world, for living in the world is only a partial experience of your complete reality. No matter how thorough your explanation or your theory might be, it is by definition incomplete.</p>
<p>Marshall was given certain tasks to cultivate inner listening, discernment of others, an understanding of human nature, human relationships and a direct experience of the natural world. He was allowed to make mistakes and to experiment as a young man. He was able to experience the condition of humanity and taste the pleasures and sorrows of a more affluent life. His relationships helped him to learn how to be with other people effectively, to partner with other people, to live with other people; but he was kept from becoming a completely worldly person—a person whose whole focus and emphasis is on achievement within the world. For this, he experienced restraint—he was offered opportunities which he had to decline, given encouragement which he could not accept, experienced inducements which he had to deny.</p>
<p>He made mistakes, oh yes, but none that would cost him his preparation for his future life. His imperfections are acknowledged. He recognizes them. His role does not require him to meet the expectations of others who think that if there was a New Message from God, it would be delivered by some kind of super person, a super man or a super woman—someone who is without flaw, someone who is magnificent and can perform miracles. These kinds of expectations are inherent in human perception, for people do not understand the nature, purpose and plan of God. Even the scriptures themselves cannot reveal this fully.</p>
<p>Marshall had to travel as a young man, living without definition in the context of society. He had to maintain a focus on developing certain kinds of qualities—the quality of observation, the quality of evaluation and compassion for others, even concerning very grievous situations. But at the same time, he was kept out of war and conflict. He was kept out of marriage and parenthood. He was kept out of career, his goals always being moderated by the presence of Knowledge, the deeper Intelligence within him. Patience, perseverance, self-confidence, humility, compassion, friendly, but reserved—these are the qualities that he had to cultivate way before he could have any sense of his greater purpose and calling in the world.</p>
<p>It is true that the Message must be given to one person to maintain its purity, and this person must be the right person, the one chosen. This person must have assistance and companionship. For this, Marshall was sent a woman of great strength and integrity to be his wife and companion, and he was given a son who would help him fulfill his great mission in the world. And others were sent to assist him, some staying with him only for a while and others continuing with him even to this day. For the Messenger cannot travel alone. The Messenger must have assistance in receiving and bringing such a great teaching into the world, and his companions must be strong and courageous, flexible and unassuming. Their connection with Marshall must be deep, profound and pre-established, you see.</p>
<p>For he will not win people over with charm and charisma or intellectual brilliance. He will not captivate people by fulfilling their expectations of grandeur or power or strength. His power is in the New Message and in his capacity to receive and to carry the New Message and to be its first student and primary representative.</p>
<p>People’s notions of power are so distorted, are so incorrect, that people look for the wrong things here. Grace and humility, perseverance, trustworthiness, patience, silence—these are the qualities of a powerful individual. Yet this is not what your cultures and your nations celebrate as demonstrating a real power or efficacy. Only the willful are so recognized, only the adventurous, only the ambitious, only those who use force to gain what they claim for themselves. But that is not the power of Grace. That is not the power that God emphasizes within the individual, and that is not the power of the Messenger.</p>
<p>It would be a long time, even with his companions, before the reality of his great endeavor would be revealed to him. This was done to prevent any error on his part or the risk of denial and avoidance. For if the timing is not correct here, a person can feel overwhelmed and withdraw—even from something they are destined to do, that is meant for them to do, that they have come into the world to do. Those who create their roles, those who advertise themselves in their self-created roles do not have this quality, do you see? They do not possess the gifts of the Messenger.</p>
<p>The Revelation of the New Message will be astonishing even to the Messenger. He will hardly be able to believe it, given his human perspective and given his long acclimation to the world. He has developed a personal identity, set of habits and self-orientations, so the Revelation was striking him, and he did not welcome it. He did not want it.</p>
<p>All the great Messengers that have been sent into the world have experienced the very same thing, and once the truth of their mission was revealed to them, they were very reluctant. It looked impossible. It looked improbable. It looked overwhelming. It looked dangerous. It looked to be beyond their abilities. It was inconsistent with how they viewed themselves. It spoke of a strength they barely knew they had. And it denied all other claims that that individual might have for themselves as to who they were and what they must have and do and so forth.</p>
<p>So it was not until late in receiving the New Message that Marshall was told what it really was. All those years of receiving the Revelation had to be conducted without the certainty of what it meant, what it was for, what it was to serve and do and how it could be expressed and explained. He had to undertake this without knowing really what it was for and what it really was, you see. He had to take this journey, and others had to take it with him, only knowing that the journey they were on was vital and important and essential, but beyond that, it remained mysterious and confounding. Once the Revelation was given as to the real nature of what he had been receiving and learning and attempting to communicate, that began a whole other stage in his preparation.</p>
<p>Now he had to transcend his former idea of himself to meet the requirements that his mission placed upon him. Now instead of being just a person who was given something important to do, he had to become a vessel for the greater gift that he was bound and destined to receive and to give. And he had to overcome his self-doubt and his reluctance, all the while knowing that what he was doing was beyond his comprehension and likely beyond even his capacity to understand.</p>
<p>Throughout history, the great Messengers that have come into the world have not been understood, and their Messages were often misinterpreted and misapplied. Such is the difficulty of bringing something pure into a world and to a humanity that is impure, that is full of grievance and conflict, ambition and degeneration.</p>
<p>People do not understand the nature of the mission, nor the great burden that the Messenger would have to assume. Instead, stories were invented to capture the public imagination, to sell the teaching, to amplify its significance to the unknowing, to give it a power that people wanted it to have instead of the power that it really possessed. In many cases, the Message was never written down correctly. It was contained within the Messenger and demonstrated by the Messenger.</p>
<p>But in this situation, it was necessary that the Message be rendered, recorded, transcribed and published so people would have access to the pure Message and the pure Teaching. Should anything happen to the Messenger, the real Message would not be lost. Also, this was done to preserve the Message in its pure form so it does not undergo radical alterations or adaptations in the future, so it is not allied with other things for the convenience of people’s understanding or for the advantage of governments or the state.</p>
<p>Therefore, Marshall had to receive the Message before he could communicate the Message. He had to put it into a permanent form, sometimes having to alter the words to make them more comprehensible, but delivering the Message in as pure a form as possible with the assistance of those who were sent to help him. In this way, should anything happen to the Messenger, the Message is here. People will have to deal with the Message itself instead of just repudiating the Messenger. They will have to struggle with the Message itself and all that it challenges in people and all that it acknowledges that is true.</p>
<p>You are seeing for the first time here the real nature of Revelation, the real nature and purpose of a true Messenger in the world. You are seeing here for the first time how God gives great Messages into the world to serve the world at that time and for the times to come and how the successive Messages given over a long period of time have built upon each other and met new and changing conditions. You are seeing for the first time here how God works in the world beyond the stories from the past, beyond the proclamations and the traditions, whether they be true or false. You are seeing the nature of Revelation.</p>
<p>This is important to see because if the process of Revelation is not understood, the Revelation itself will not be understood. If the burden of the Messenger is not recognized, then the Messenger will not be recognized. Should you not recognize the Messenger, it will be to your great disadvantage, for he brings with him an awareness and a preparation for the great dangers facing humanity and great opportunities for human unity and cooperation. He brings with him the blessings of purpose and integrity in one’s individual life and the meaning of relationships at a higher, more complete level. He brings with him a promise of humanity’s future within a Greater Community of intelligent life in the Universe and what humanity will have to do to face a world of declining resources and growing human conflict.</p>
<p>The Messenger has brought the Message. It is in a form that people can read. It is not some later interpretation. It is not something that has been kept secret by hidden parties or inner circles alone. It has been given to the people during the process of Revelation itself. This has never been done before. Now living in a world where things can be published, and writings can be transcribed and translated into other languages and presented electronically, gives the opportunity for the written word to be given everywhere. Phenomenal it is! It so important now, for you do not have much time, for the world is changing too fast, and the dangers are coming—the Great Waves of change are coming to the world. You do not have decades and centuries to try to figure out what this is or to try to translate or have it pass just from person to person in some kind of oral tradition. There is no time for that now, you see, and that is why the Revelation has been given in this way.</p>
<p>Marshall’s progress and preparation has been delayed by the failures of certain people to come and assist him. He has been held back by circumstances. Certain others were called, but did not respond, and some who responded could not fulfill their destiny here—all this holding back the Revelation of the New Message at a time when it was needed, slowing the whole process down. This then is the hazard of bringing a Revelation from God into the world. There is so much that can hold it back, that can thwart it and that can even prevent it from being received and communicated.</p>
<p>This New Message is not just for one nation, for one group, for one religion. It is for the whole people of the world. It is a Revelation for the world. It is not meant to replace the world’s religions, but to call for their unity and their strength, to emphasize their common truth, to end the ceaseless conflicts between them and to unite them so they may serve humanity in its time of great need.</p>
<p>It will be very challenging for people to receive the Message and the Messenger. He will point to the New Message, for you must deal with the New Message first. But his presence and the meaning and the great substance of his Divine communication is something that will be very challenging to face and to take on. It will take much time to learn and to comprehend. People will think they understand it, but they will not understand it. People will claim that it is easy to comprehend, but they have not comprehended it. People will associate it with other things—things they are familiar with, other things that have been learned and taught in the world—but there has been nothing like this ever brought into the world. Knowledge and wisdom from the Greater Community and teaching about spirituality at the level of Knowledge have only been known to very few people in the history of the world and never presented as a Message for humanity itself.</p>
<p>Therefore, the challenge will be for the recipient—for you and for all those who are so fortunate to receive the New Message at the earliest time possible. It will bring clarity, purpose and power to your life, and you need that right now. But its gift to the world is even greater than what it will do for your life. But to know this you must have a relationship with the New Message. You cannot stand apart from it and judge it and criticize it and evaluate it. That is hopeless. It is foolish. What you will encounter are your own prejudices, your own limitations and your own assumptions and preconceived ideas. You have to come to this with an open mind to see what the New Message can reveal to you. If you come fearfully or thinking it will upset your beliefs or invalidate your traditions, then you will not be able to penetrate it. You will just judge it blindly. You will not be able to receive its grace, its power and its vision of the future.</p>
<p>The Messenger now will need great assistance from others to bring this New Message into the world. It is not something one person can do. It is not something a small group of individuals—committed as they are, devoted as they are—can really do. It is going to take the assistance of others. It is going to take people learning The Way of Knowledge, learning the New Message, living the New Message and seeing its complete relevance to the world that you see and its complete relevance to the world you have not yet seen.</p>
<p>The Messenger will need protection. He will need true students. He will need supporters. And he will need others to simply bear witness to this great event in human history. It will seem incredible, incomprehensible. People will not believe it. They will think it is impossible. God gave all God’s revelations so long ago. It is in the sacred texts. Many people will not be able to accept that God has spoken again, that there is a New Revelation in the world—as if they could assume to know the mind and will of God, as if they could insist that they knew God’s Plan and God’s truth for themselves. This is foolish and arrogant, of course, but many people take this position without question.</p>
<p>To know the New Message, you must witness it. You must learn of it. You must let it provide clarity and meaning for your life. That is the only way you will know its Source, its truth and its relevance to the world and to your life. It represents a Divine relationship, and it is this relationship that you can bring into your spiritual and religious traditions—allowing the New Message to add another dimension to your religious practice and study, letting it fulfill what was preserved and presented before. For humanity is facing a new set of circumstances that it has never faced before, and a New Revelation has been given to prepare humanity, to warn humanity and to strengthen humanity so it may unite in the face of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>God knows what humanity needs even though humanity remains confused. God knows what is coming for the human family even though the human family is obsessed with its past. God knows that humanity must unite in the face of great danger even though people continue their conflicts and continue their admonitions against one another. What God knows and what people believe are not the same.</p>
<p>This makes the translation and the presentation of the New Message difficult, but such a Message must be given. It must reach those who can hear, who can see, who can know, whose approach is pure, who do not come here with condemnation and who come here to receive clarity and power, purpose and the meaning of relationship. They come to be blessed by the New Message and empowered by it and confronted by it.</p>
<p>What humanity does with this New Message will be up to humanity. God cannot control humanity’s response. God cannot control the outcome of humanity’s response. If you understood the nature of God’s relationship with the world and with humanity, this would be very clear to you. But if you do not understand it, it will seem confusing and confounding and upsetting perhaps. But God has placed within each person the power of Knowledge, the ability to see and know the truth beyond deception and beyond personal preference. This Knowledge must come to the fore for many people now, for the world to have a future, for humanity to be able to continue and to set a new course.</p>
<p>The New Message does not have a political agenda. It is here to inspire right action and the recognition and the necessity of cooperation in the face of real change and events in the world. It will teach you how to listen, and to learn what God wants you to do in your life, and what is meant for you and where your true strengths and success lie—beyond all the persuasions and deceptions of the world.</p>
<p>The Messenger now is in the world. He is even now continuing to bring the New Message into the world. He has done his great task of receiving the majority of the New Message. It will be complete. He is not here to proclaim himself as a ruler or a leader or a great power. He is here simply to bear witness to the New Message and to be its primary advocate. He is not here to claim political power, economic power, to displace other people or to overthrow anyone. His presence here is to serve as a demonstration and as a presentation of the wisdom and the love of God and the great challenges that are now facing the human family, for which humanity is not prepared.</p>
<p>Therefore, receive the Messenger and support him in whatever way you can. Allow your heart to tell you what must be done. Recognize and receive the blessings of the New Message, which is now becoming available to the world for the very first time.</p>
<p>Take time to consider it. Take time to be with it. Take time to struggle with it. Take time to allow it to reveal things to you that have never been shown to you before. Allow it to confirm what you have always known to be true and to reveal the thread of truth that has been in your life all along. Allow it to illuminate your religious traditions, to reveal their purity, to reveal their core truth, to reveal that they have all come from God, to reveal the One Spirituality of humanity and to reveal humanity’s great threshold of facing a Universe full of intelligent life and of learning to reverse the great decline that is taking place in the world today.</p>
<p>The burden is on the recipient. The Messenger has taken a long and difficult journey. Even at this point, the burden is on the recipient now. It is the integrity, the honesty and the desire of the heart that will count and that will enable you to receive the New Message for yourself and to understand its importance for the world. Let this be your understanding.</p>

<p id="date">As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on March 30, 2008<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>Humanity is about to face its greatest trial and its most difficult challenges. Many people are feeling this, of course—a vague sense of anxiety, pervasive concern over the future—while others still dream that life will continue as they have known it, only better now, for it must be better, they think. But humanity is entering its time of great trial and difficulty. This must be accepted if you are to understand where your life is going, if you are to understand the sequence of events, if you are to understand how you must prepare for the future—a future that will be unlike the past in so many ways. This is not a negative perspective. It is a revelation of what is coming.</p>
<p>Those who argue against this are perpetuating their own sense of denial, revealing their weakness and their inability to face a changing set of circumstances. People’s hopes and dreams cannot now be the foundation of their lives, for they must prepare for what is coming so that they may survive the Great Waves of change and be of service to others, which is ultimately what they are here to do.</p>
<p>You may project any ideas upon the future—your hopes, your fears, your dreams, your anxieties. You may paint a happy picture or a frightening picture for yourself. But life is moving. It is not dominated or even affected by your projections.</p>
<p>People’s attitudes, of course, are important. It is important to have a supportive attitude, but this attitude must be founded upon a real understanding of what is happening around you, where your life is going and what life will require of you for the future. You build your positive, constructive attitude around a recognition of reality. Certain things have been set in motion now that you cannot change by wishful thinking or by your own personal admonitions.</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has sent a New Message into the world to prepare humanity for this new era, for all the Revelations that have been given to humanity before cannot prepare it for what is coming now. The wisdom of the great traditions remains as an inspiration, as a correction, as an emphasis and as a higher standard. But a New Message from God must come now to prepare humanity for the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world and for humanity’s encounter with intelligent life from beyond the world, which represents a new reality and a new challenge for the human family.</p>
<p>You can face these things and learn of them through the revelations of God’s New Message, through your own experience and through the signs that the world is giving you now—signs which are coming every day to inform you and to prepare you, to warn you and to shake you out of your self-preoccupation and your attachment to your hopes and your dreams.</p>
<p>These revelations will be shocking. They may be emotionally difficult for you, for they will require you to reconsider many things. They may arouse tremendous fear and anxiety because you will see that you are not prepared and you are not yet strong enough to face these things, even emotionally. But no matter what your initial reactions, it is far better to see, to know and to be prepared than to remain in ignorance or denial while the world changes around you.</p>
<p>God’s New Revelation provides a warning, a blessing and a preparation for the Great Waves of change and for humanity’s encounter with a Greater Community of intelligent life. These two great phenomena more than anything else will affect the future and the destiny of humanity, the lives of every person in the world today and the future of their children.</p>
<p>People are consumed with other things, of course, with other problems that seem significant and grave in the moment. But these things are small and often insignificant compared to the power of the Great Waves of change and humanity’s encounter with a Greater Community of intelligent life.</p>
<p>What will save the world now will not be these preoccupations, these fantasies, these admonitions that people everywhere are still maintaining to try to assure themselves that life will give them what they want and that they have control over their destiny. Your control over your destiny must come from a greater power within you, a power that God has placed there.</p>
<p>Whether you are religious or not, no matter what nation you live in or what religion that you devote yourself to, the power and presence of this deeper Knowledge lives within you. It is true for everyone, for God does not discriminate. God is not delighted with the religious and angry with the unreligious. God has placed the saving Grace within each person. The real purpose of religion is to bring people to this saving Grace. Religion in all of its forms is intended to do this. Even though religion has taken on other manifestations and assumed other purposes and in many cases has been adopted by political forces, this is its fundamental purpose: to bring you to Knowledge, to bring you to this deeper guiding intelligence that the Creator of all life has placed within you and within each person as a potential.</p>
<p>The fact that the world is in its present deteriorating condition is evidence that people are not aware of Knowledge and are not following Knowledge. They are following ambition. They are following their social conditioning. They are following their grievances. They are following their ideals, all things of the mind – the personal, worldly mind. But there is a deeper mind within you now, and it is this greater intelligence that will respond to God’s New Message. It is this greater intelligence that will be your raft to navigate the difficult waters ahead.</p>
<p>Only God knows what will save humanity. You may have many plans and theories. You may insist upon your ideas and your beliefs. You may even claim that your ideas are sanctioned by God or directed by God, but only God knows what will save humanity. For humanity must now be saved—not for Heaven, but for its future here in this world—so that the world may remain a habitable environment for humanity and so that you may learn to deal with competition from beyond the world and all the many influences that will be placed upon humanity by other nations in the Universe who seek to have the world for themselves, to benefit themselves.</p>
<p>When you begin to learn of the Great Waves of change, which the world is revealing to you with each passing day and which God’s New Message addresses directly, and when you begin to face the reality that the world is undergoing intervention from races from beyond the world who seek to gain control of humanity and the resources of the world – if you can face these things, which will be a great challenge, then you will realize that you do not have an answer. Perhaps this will lead you to feel helpless and hopeless. But you will realize you do not have an answer and that the answers that you can imagine, or that you believe will be effective, will be insufficient to deal with challenges of this magnitude. Good ideas here will not be potent enough to deal with the challenges to come and the challenges that are already here.</p>
<p>What will save humanity now will be recognition, courage and necessity. The recognition is that the Great Waves of change are upon you, that humanity has destroyed so much of the life-sustaining resources of the world, and that you are living in a world in decline—of declining resources, of environmental degradation, of changing climate and the ever-growing temptation of nations to go to war with one another.</p>
<p>As you face the reality that your world is being visited, not by friendly forces, but by those that would seek to plant themselves in an advantageous way, to influence human leadership and to pacify the human public—if you can face these things, you will realize you do not have an answer. This is very important, you see, because here you must turn to God beyond you and the intelligence that God has placed within you. Here is where your intellect will run out of reasonable answers. Here you will see the limits of your ideas. Here you will face the limitations that your social and religious conditioning has placed upon you.</p>
<p>With this recognition, there must come courage. You cannot be weak and faltering in the face of the Great Waves of change or in facing competition and intervention from the Universe around you. You cannot be ambivalent, only concerned with your happiness and with acquiring those things you want for yourself. You are standing at the threshold of immense change and challenge. You cannot be dreaming of other things if you are to be prepared.</p>
<p>God has already given you the power of Knowledge to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your greater accomplishment in life. But if you do not heed this or do not believe that such a power and presence live within you, then you may pray to God for deliverance. You may pray to God for salvation. You may pray to God to intervene in the difficult circumstances around you. But God has already provided the answer, you see.</p>
<p>The Lord of the Universe is not going to become preoccupied with your social welfare, for the answer has been placed within you regarding what you must do and not do, what you must release and what you must focus upon. This takes courage, of course—courage of a very fundamental nature, courage that is greatly lacking, particularly amongst the wealthy people of the world, who have become accustomed to having their needs fulfilled, who believe the world is there to satisfy their desires and ambitions, who feel that their wealth and privileges are like an entitlement from God, who think that they are better than others who are struggling even to meet the basic requirements of life.</p>
<p>There must be recognition. Without this, you have no hope. Your life will be overwhelmed, overtaken by forces you did not anticipate. Your privileges will be lost by forces you do not understand. And you, like many others, will be enraged—blaming governments, blaming other nations, blaming life itself for your predicament, when in fact you missed the signs and the cues along the way. You did not respond to the urgings of Knowledge within yourself. You thought your anxiety was just a psychological problem. You thought that your concern for the future was unjustified, when in fact it was attempting to speak to you all along.</p>
<p>The calling is within you now to respond, to become aware, to look without hostility and preference, to see what you can see coming over the horizon. Instead of planning your future around what you want, you must plan your future around what you see, what you feel and what you know. If this seeing, feeling and knowing is authentic, if it is true to Knowledge within you and not merely some kind of bargaining on your part, then you will be able to build a strong foundation. And you will begin to change your life before the requirement for that change is upon you. You will begin to alter the course of your life and to shift your allegiance to Knowledge before necessity has overtaken you.</p>
<p>You have to find and build the courage to do this. No one else can do this for you. You cannot assume that the government will take care of you. You cannot assume that your city government can take care of you or that your hospital can take care of you under all circumstances. You must rely upon the power of Knowledge within yourself, within your relationships and within others. But this is not a weak assurance. This is not a passive role. You will have to become very observant, very objective and willing to face whatever is coming over the horizon. Otherwise, you will panic, and your life will be overtaken with tragic consequences. You may blame God for this, but God has been warning you all along through your experience, through your dreams, through your sensations and through your deeper emotions. God has been warning you all along, and the world has been giving you its signs all along.</p>
<p>What are the signs you should be looking for in the world at this time?</p>
<p>You should be looking for the price and availability of food and the availability of water.<br />
You should be looking at how nations are regarding one another.<br />
You should be looking at the financial condition of your nation.<br />
You should be preparing yourself for the Great Waves of change.<br />
You should be watching the climate conditions of the world.</p>
<p>The world is giving you these signs. You must watch them carefully now. They will help to inform you about how much time you have and how quickly you must begin to make the kinds of changes in your life that will be necessary. They are informing you. If you are not paying attention, what can life do for you? If you are arguing with this reality, if you are denying it or thinking it is false or that only governments are to blame, then you are not taking responsibility for your life.</p>
<p>You will need a tough love for the tough times. God is giving you the real love—by warning you, blessing you and preparing you. If you think love is about something else, then you are confused about the nature, purpose and reality of love, and you do not understand what God’s love really is.</p>
<p>Why would God give you pleasantries when in fact your life is in danger? Would that be love? Why would God try to fulfill all of your desires for happiness when your world itself is imperiled? To want this, to expect this or to demand this represents a fundamental confusion. To think it is all a matter of perspective means that you do not yet realize the power and the potency of Knowledge within yourself, which is not governed by preferential thinking. It is not swayed by fear or desire. That is what makes it powerful. That is what makes it reliable. That is what makes it your greatest inner resource.</p>
<p>We have mentioned three things: recognition, courage and necessity. Recognition and courage are important on an individual level particularly. But it will be necessity that will give humanity its greatest chance. For the Great Waves of change and the challenges that will be coming and are here already from the Greater Community represent the two great initiatives for real human unity. They represent necessity.</p>
<p>Humanity is imperiled from within and from without. From within, it is facing a world in decline. Its growing populations will have to contend with a slowly shrinking well of resources and with environmental destruction. It will have to pay attention now to the laws of nature, which hold little mercy for the unprepared. It will have to face a fundamental decision over whether nations will compete and contend and fight over the remaining resources or whether they will unite to preserve them, to extend them and to make sure the human family as a whole has what it needs.</p>
<p>It is not about national security now. It is about world security. Your nation will not remain unaffected if other nations fail. If millions of people stream over your borders because they cannot sustain themselves in your neighboring countries, that will have a great impact upon you. If humanity cannot feed itself, great war and tribulation will follow. Think not that these challenges are not upon you, for the world is telling you otherwise, and Knowledge within you is urging you to respond.</p>
<p>It will be the necessity of facing the Great Waves of change and cooperating to meet its challenges that will unite humanity at last. Humanity will not be united because of an agreed political agenda or shared ideology or shared religion. It will not be the result of a natural reconciliation between cultures, nations and groups. It will be generated by a very fundamental truth—the truth that united you can succeed, but divided you will fail.</p>
<p>That truth will now become the governing principle if humanity is to choose the path that will sustain it, redeem it and give it a better future than the past. For the past has been a record of human conflict, competition and human tragedy. You are entering a set of circumstances now where a few people cannot be enriched while the rest of the world goes into decline, for they too will lose everything as a result. It cannot be that a few are wealthy while the many are struggling to survive, for in the face of the Great Waves of change, whole nations will fail under such an arrangement.</p>
<p>Nations will have to cooperate now or face mutual destruction. The peoples of the world will have to be cared for at a much higher level than currently exists. Necessity will drive this. Cooperation will be necessary now. And those groups and those forces that will not cooperate will have to become isolated because they are endangering the whole world.</p>
<p>Necessity will also drive you to face the Greater Community. For in emerging worlds such as your own, the first contact with intelligent life in the Universe will be with resource explorers and economic collectives, predatory races that seek to take advantage of a weak and divided world such as your own. The New Message reveals the reality of life beyond your borders and how you will be able to tell friend from foe and how those who are really your allies or potential allies will behave regarding you in the future.</p>
<p>No one is going to come and rescue you, and those that claim to be here to do so will be your greatest danger. You do not understand this yet because you do not understand the reality of life in the Greater Community. The revelation of this must be given to you from God if it is to be real and authentic and not some form of manipulation from some other race who seeks to gain advantage here.</p>
<p>Necessity will require that human nations unite for their own defense, establish their own rules of engagement with any [foreign races] who are in the world today or who may seek to come here in the future. If one nation is infiltrated, it will threaten the whole world. This is thinking at a different level now. It is not thinking as a member of a tribe or a group or a nation. It is thinking as a member of the human family. It is being concerned with the welfare and the security of the entire human family, the native race of this world that is now facing intervention from beyond and competition from beyond.</p>
<p>You must learn to think in these ways, to gain the courage to do this and to recognize that those who would visit your world are not here because they are fascinated with you or they are trying to uplift you spiritually or they are going to shepherd you into some glorious future.</p>
<p>In the history of your own world, ignorant races have fallen under complete subjugation following assumptions of this kind, believing that advanced technology represents a higher moral or ethical approach to life.</p>
<p>You are entering a Greater Community of intelligent life in the Universe, a competitive environment on a scale you can hardly imagine. And you are entering it as a weak and divided race, stewarding a beautiful planet that is valued by others.</p>
<p>Intervention is occurring now because you are destroying this invaluable asset, this beautiful world; because you have produced technology that others can use; and because those who seek to intervene do not want to see you become more powerful than you are today. This is their opportunity, and they will take advantage of it—generating human conflict, weakening the strongest nations, pitting nations against one another to weaken them and to make them more dependent upon the presence that is now amongst them, a presence from the Greater Community.</p>
<p>You know not of your predicament. You know not of your vulnerability. You are still thinking like people living in isolation, assuming that everything important in life has to do with your local environment, your histories and your temperament. You do not see that you live within a Greater Community of intelligent life and that humanity is facing a grave set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Those who are in the world today do not represent military forces. They are commercial forces. They are small in number. They do not have great power, except the power of persuasion, and it is this that they are using to turn people against one another, against their governments and away from Knowledge within themselves, which can never be turned by any force—from this world or any world.</p>
<p>You may say, “Oh, this is too much for me! I don’t think I can deal with this!” But this is your world. This is your life. This is your future. What do you mean you cannot deal with it? Of course you can. You were sent here by God to deal with it, to contribute to the world. It is because you are dealing with other things that have little or no value that you feel weak and impotent in the face of such great circumstances. Your romances, the acquisition of wealth, your hobbies, your pastimes, your dilemmas, your conflicts with other individuals—this is all sucking the life out of you! Your power, your potency, your courage, your resourcefulness—all being lost to things of little or no value.</p>
<p>The hour is late. It is too late for human folly. You must prepare for the future as an individual, and you must promote human freedom and unity in the face of necessity. This is what will save humanity and give it a foundation for the future that will be greater than anything it has ever had before—greater than its brief periods of opulence and success and indulgence. You now have to survive within a declining world. And you will have to become strong enough to resist the temptations that will come from the Greater Community. You have to resist intervention. You have to become serious about your life, much more serious than you have been before.</p>
<p>All the problems that humanity is facing now, many of which are very serious, will be overshadowed by the Great Waves of change and by competition from beyond the world. For what could you hope to preserve or to gain if the world becomes uninhabitable for most people, if there is not enough food for the human family, if your essential resources decline to such a point that nations cannot function? And what can you hope to gain or achieve for yourself if humanity falls under control and subjugation to foreign powers from the Greater Community itself? Consider any problem that you think is important in the world in the light of these two great forces, and you will see where your emphasis must reside.</p>
<p>How will you take care of yourself? How will you take care of the elderly? How will you take care of children? How will you take care of the disadvantaged in the face of the Great Waves of change? How can you become a positive resource for the world, an influence—able to provide for others, able to have vision and clarity, able to have strength? How will you be able to recognize that humanity must unite for its own defense in the Greater Community or it will be infiltrated, subjugated, persuaded and overtaken by other powers?</p>
<p>This is what happens in nature. This is part of life. This has been going on in the world for centuries, between human beings. It is going on throughout the Universe though there are different circumstances and different restraints that exist in the Greater Community which you can learn about.</p>
<p>This is reality. The great tragedy for humanity is that only the very poor are facing reality, for they have no choice. The wealthy are squandering themselves—their resources, their education, their time, their emphasis—on the most foolish and absurd fascinations and interests. It is too late for this now.</p>
<p>That is why there is a New Message from God in the world because without this New Message, humanity will fail. Its failure will come incrementally, but it will come. And intervention in the world will take place without human awareness and without human resistance.</p>
<p>Do not deny this, for if you do, you are missing the great Message from the Creator. If you do not see the warning, you will not value the blessing, and you will not see the need for the preparation. For God’s New Message, which is meant for all the peoples of the world, is to provide this warning, this blessing and this preparation. Not everyone will be able to respond, but many will have to—from different nations, from different religions. Everything is in the balance now. The fate of the world will be determined within the next few decades. That is an incredibly short period of time.</p>
<p>Life is moving. Events are taking place. The results of humanity’s degradation and foolish use of the world are now moving on their own. Technology alone will not be an answer. There must be human recognition, courage and unity. Technology will only be a tool to help you, but without this recognition, this courage and this unity, technology will only hasten your demise.</p>
<p>The Creator of all life loves this world, loves humanity and has given humanity the power of Knowledge, has given humanity the great Revelations of the past and has given humanity now a New Revelation for this time and for the times to come. You are living in a time of Revelation, for you are living in a time of unprecedented need, facing a set of circumstances that humanity has never had to face before. You have faced deprivation before in the world, but you have never faced a world in decline.</p>
<p>Do not think your wealth and your privileges will insulate you from this, for you will be vulnerable. Everyone will be vulnerable. And that is why the New Message calls for human recognition, courage and unity. It is not a good idea now. It is not merely an option, for the choices are very few. And that is what gives power and potency to your time. That is what gives urgency to your life and purpose and meaning for your life.</p>
<p>Knowledge within you will guide you to make a contribution to the world with certain people in certain circumstances. The condition of the world will give you the sobriety and the conviction that you must follow this Knowledge. For this is how God will speak to you, and this is the time in which you must learn to listen.</p>

<p id="date">As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on February 25, 2008<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>At a certain point you will come to realize that this New Revelation is here to give you a new life. It is not simply to make improvements or to sweeten it with a sense of spiritual meaning or to condone your thoughts and beliefs and past actions with some kind of blessing from above.</p>
<p>At some point you will come to realize that the life you are living is really not appropriate for you. It is a compromise. And the compromise has been too great. It has been too thorough. It is a compromise with how you regard yourself, how you regard others, how you regard the world. And though this realization may be resisted, maybe it will be denied, and further compromises will be sought, in actuality it represents the beginning of a great hope for you.</p>
<p>For God knows that without Knowledge, the deeper intelligence that has been placed within you, you would live a life of compromise. You would seek compromise for security, for approval, for wealth and advantage. You would seek compromise in order to avoid ridicule or criticism or condemnation or even social rejection. Compromise would permeate everything, from your beliefs, your attitudes, your aspirations, your activities, your plans, your goals. And this would increase to a point where you really had lost contact with who and what you are.</p>
<p>Now you have become a product of your society, a product of the expectations of society, a product of your own personal thinking, but you have lost contact with the deeper thread and meaning of your life. And even if you are successful and achieve your goals, it will be empty, and the joy would be short lived, and they will come at a great price of time, energy, effort, and the rewards will be momentary and fleeting.</p>
<p>This realization, which is so denied and avoided, is the beginning of a greater promise for you. Do not resist it. Do not argue against it. Do not complain that you may have to make great changes in your life. Of course you will! Because you are being given a new life—not a slightly better rendition of your old life, not simply new scenery or new faces or new forms of stimulation. This is not a cosmetic change. This is a change of a far greater importance and depth and meaning for you. This is the kind of change your heart has been yearning for for so long For such a long time have you been laboring.</p>
<p>And now it seems to come to nothing. It seems you have failed the expectations of your culture. You might even feel you <em>are</em> a failure, that you have not fulfilled the goals and expectations of your family, your culture and even your religion. But in this seeming failure is a promise of a greater success. The old life must fail you or you must fail it in order to have this new opportunity, this opening in your life, this new beginning.</p>
<p>Many people simply want to have revelation as if it is some kind of appendage to their old life, like spirituality is like a seasoning to the tastelessness of their life. It is something they are going to add on. Now they are going to be spiritual and do spiritual things and think spiritual thoughts and do activities that look edifying and uplifting, But again, this is all for approval. This is all to seek more pleasure, more comfort, more security. The motivation for it is no different from the motivation that guides one to seek wealth and pleasure and escape from life. It is not authentic. And as a result, it does not yield an authentic result. We are speaking of something very different here.</p>
<p>And this new life, you don’t know what it means yet. You don’t know what it will look like yet because it is new. It is not your invention. It is not what you are accustomed to. And so you begin to turn this corner very slowly. Even if there are major events in your life that have brought this awareness to you, well, the journey has many steps, to allow you time to learn and to adapt and to gain a deeper foundation of confidence within yourself so that your life may become inner directed as opposed to outer directed, that you may become a person of power and strength and integrity, instead of someone who is mimicking the values of their cultures.</p>
<p>Here many things will have to be learned anew. They will have to be re-evaluated. Many of your thoughts will have to be reconsidered. Many of your firmly held beliefs will have to be questioned and in some cases even set aside. This is the price of freedom. This is the price one pays for having the opportunity to live a greater life, an authentic life, a life that is in keeping with Knowledge within themselves, a life that fulfills the destiny that they were sent into the world to fulfill.</p>
<p>Until this turning point, you are only half alive. Yes, your heart is beating, and the blood is flowing through your veins, and your senses are reporting the world around you, and you are going through the motions of your life, meeting responsibilities and obligations and trying to seek some form of pleasure or reprieve. But it is an empty existence. The real meaning and value of your life has not yet been discovered. Up until this point, Knowledge, the deeper intelligence that God has placed within you to guide and protect you, will try to keep you from harm, will try to keep you and hold you back from making serious and long lasting mistakes and commitments that will be in opposition to your ability to discover and to live a greater life in the future.</p>
<p>Here at this earlier stage Knowledge will seem latent within you, but really it is still trying to keep you out of trouble and to prevent you from giving your life away to another or to situations or to places, to people, to keep your life open. Many people are in this earlier stage of course. The emergence has not happened for them yet. When it will happen and how it will happen and even if it will happen is something you cannot tell. It is a mystery.</p>
<p>You see, before this emergence, you really are just building a foundation to become a functional person in the world. You are building life skills. You are experiencing the pleasures and the pains of this world. You are seeking pleasure and avoiding pain and finding disappointment along the way. This early preparation can be extremely important for what you will be able to realize, to accomplish and to communicate to others in the future. Even the most foolish mistakes you will make in this early stage can be very important in giving you wisdom, teaching you what is real, to value what is real, to help you discern what looks good from what <em>is</em> good, to help you discern what is good from what only looks good, to help you to discern your real inclinations from those impulses that represent your weakness and insecurity.</p>
<p>Perhaps in this earlier stage you will feel there is a Presence watching over you at times. You will sense there is a Presence with you. And you will think from time to time that there is something greater for you to do in life, but the realization has not really struck yet. It has not really rocked your foundation. It is only something you think about at the level of your intellect. It has not really penetrated your heart.</p>
<p>Your failures and your disillusionment here hold great promise for you. Your disappointments in yourself and in others and in the great pleasures for which you have paid such a great price, well, this paves the way for this realization. And this realization will not simply be a fleeting moment. It will be something that will change the course of your life, and you will not understand what has happened to you or the nature and purpose of the change until you have traveled afar in the second stage of your journey.</p>
<p>The guidelines for how to live that will be given here relate to this second stage of the journey of your life. They do not really refer to people who have not passed through this great threshold, who have not experienced this turning point. To them it will seem beneficial but confusing. It will seem restraining. It will challenge their idea of freedom. It will seem to require too much effort and responsibility because they are not yet ready to make this effort or to assume this responsibility. They are still trying to get out of life what they want, beyond their basic needs. They are trying to get out of life what they want. They do not yet realize that they were sent into the world for a purpose. They have no memory of their Ancient Home, and so they think this life is all important, it is everything. They want to live for the moment, for themselves. And so it is a very different awareness that one begins to gain after this great threshold. And the guidelines for living here become not only helpful but essential for success.</p>
<p>The first requirement is to accept the great change that is happening and to leave the explanation open. You will not be able to understand it. Your intellect is referenced to your past and former life. It cannot account for what is occurring with you now, and for the impulses that you feel now, and for the orientation that is slowly emerging within you. Your intellect will try but will be unsuccessful at comprehending the meaning of this.</p>
<p>Some people try to go backwards here. They want to go back to whatever they thought gave them a sense of security and stability, self-assurance, but unfortunately they have gone too far now, for those attempts will be seen as empty, only pulling them back to a former life that they found unfulfilling—lacking in meaning, purpose and value. Now they are embarking on a new kind of journey, and they cannot define it.</p>
<p>Therefore, allow this change to occur. Do not try to define it. Do not even use ideas from other spiritual traditions to try to define it. Allow it to be a mystery, for to you it will be a mystery. Mystery exists beyond the realm of the intellect. Honor this. Accept this. The Mystery is now beginning to emerge in your life, whereas before it was held back. Before, there was nowhere in your life for it to come forth, to guide you, to bless you and to prepare you. Now the Mystery is beginning to emerge. Let this happen.</p>
<p>You will become confused about what to do regarding your relationships with people, primarily, and secondarily, your relationship with where you live, the work that you do, your activities, your hobbies, your interests and so forth. Let this confusion exist. It is healthy. It is natural. It is part of the transition, You are building a bridge to a new life. You are not yet fully living that new life. You are building a bridge. You are in transition. Transitions are confusing because you are moving from one understanding to another understanding, from one experience of life to another experience of life. The transitions mean that you cannot go back, and you have not gone far enough to go fully forward, so you have to be on this bridge, going through this transition.</p>
<p>Leave your future open. Set aside plans beyond what you must do to simply maintain yourself in the world. Here you must have trust that clarity will come, and clarity will come when you feel that you are prepared to move forward and are willing to move forward into new territory. As long as you hesitate, well, the clarity will not come. As long as you are bargaining and trying to work out some kind of deal to keep something from your old life, the certainty will not come. The clarity will not come because you have not yet turned that corner. It is like the answer is around the side of the mountain, and you have to go around that mountain to find it.</p>
<p>This is confusing for the intellect, but now the intellect must yield to a greater power within you, the power that God has put within you to guide you and to bless you and to prepare you for this greater life. You will still have to be very responsible in what you do and what you commit yourself to, in what you assign yourself to in life, in how you use your time and energy and so forth, but there is something greater moving in you now.</p>
<p>Next, do not go tell all your friends and family, for they will not understand. Unless one of them has turned this corner, they will think you are being foolish or they will think that something bad has happened to you or that you have been influenced by something that they are suspicious of. They might even think you have gone mad! Therefore, you must keep this new experience to yourself as much as possible. If you are fortunate, there will be one person, either within your family currently or someone you will meet who will give you a sign to move forward. You will want to share your new experiences, and the strangeness and the wonder of those thoughts and ideas that are coming to you, and of the change that you are feeling that is liberating you from the past, but you must be very careful who you share this with, for others will not understand, and their lack of understanding and their criticism and condemnation will really hurt you and rob you of confidence.</p>
<p>To move from being an outer directed person to being an inner directed person is a tremendous change, and you will feel very shaky at first. You will not feel very strong. You will be very uncertain of what you are doing. You will be like the little tender shoot in the great forest that must be protected until it gains enough strength to stand upon its own. So there are dangers at this beginning, at this early part of your journey—premature conclusions, indiscretion with others, self-doubts, the attempt to try to define your life—all these things are dangers because they can prevent you from proceeding onward, and once this journey begins, you must proceed onward. This is so important! Imagine that you are climbing a great mountain, well, once you begin to gain a little altitude, well, you do not want to have to go back. You need to go forward.</p>
<p>The Knowledge that God has placed within you will urge you to go onward, to keep your eyes open, your ears open, to be very watchful, to be very careful. Do not think that God is going to protect you now from every form of harm and prevent injury and disappointment and tragedy for you. You must be very careful. This is part of gaining a greater awareness. Previously, you were not careful. You were reckless. You were foolish, impulsive. Now you must become watchful, discerning, patient, careful. In doing this, you will see how you have been wasting your life, your time, your energy, over meaningless pursuits and over thinking that would never lead to resolution—self-doubt, self-recrimination, judgment of others—and the immensely superficial conversation that most people continue to maintain around you.</p>
<p>Next, you must gather your resources and conserve your energy so that you have time to be alone, to learn to be still and to listen. You will seek quiet now more than stimulation. You will find that the social activities around you will be aggravating and irritating to you, for you need something else now. You need to listen. You need to be quiet. You need to gain a greater connection to this emerging power within yourself.</p>
<p>This will change your priorities. This will change your desires. This will affect your decisions. And you will find that you will no longer be interested in doing things with other people that you did before. Things which were never really very fulfilling, now you will just want to avoid. You will see their emptiness, and you will not want them, and they will be an aggravation to you. And the pettiness and superficiality of people’s conversations, and their habitual condemnation of others, you will find to be aggravating. This is natural.</p>
<p>This is what it means to come home to yourself, to find your real values, your real priorities, your natural inclinations as opposed to everything that has been conditioned into you. You will seek time away from other people. You will seek time alone. You will not want to have constant stimulation. You will need the confidence to do this. Most people cannot sit still for more than five seconds before they are driven out of themselves again. Here you must sit and listen. Gaze at nature. Listen to the sounds of the world, the natural world.</p>
<p>You will see here how your energy—your mental energy and your physical energy—have been misappropriated in the past, and you will want to conserve them, for you need them now. You are gathering your strength. You are gathering your resources. You are not throwing your life away. You want to plug up all the holes where your ship is leaking, where you are losing ground to others or to situations—through habit or through the designs of others.</p>
<p>The New Message will speak to you here, for it is imbued with the power and the mystery of God. And it is this power and this mystery that is drawing you now, for what is really happening in your life is that God <em>is</em> moving in you. God is moving you. But this movement is a freedom from things at the outset. You have to disengage. You cannot take an old life into a new life, and so you are going through an incremental disengagement. Part of this disengagement is physical. It has to do with your activities and involvement with others, but much of it is internal. It is your ideas. It is your compulsions. It is what you think you <em>should</em> do. It is what you think you <em>should</em> be or you <em>should</em> have or how you should be with others. For this is where the social conditioning really takes place.</p>
<p>And every day you move forward, you break these chains. They have less and less power over you. As you move up the mountain, the draw and the attraction of the lowlands is left behind, and you become freer and lighter and less burdened with the expectations of others and with your own needs that were never genuine to begin with.</p>
<p>During this time, limit your exposure to the media. Do not read a lot of books. Do not go to movies unless they are really inspirational, for you are gathering your strength. You are calling your strength to you. You are conserving your energy. You are paying attention to the inside now more than to the outside. You are moving away from the racket of the world. Allow this. Follow this. Strengthen this. For this is a natural inclination.</p>
<p>If there are long-standing friendships and they cannot follow you now, you will have to let them go, lovingly. They will fall away from you, for they cannot go this far up the mountain yet. You are going further than they can go yet. You have turned a corner they have not turned.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing in the early stages is people’s obligation to others, to their friends, their family. The only exception to this obligation is the raising of your children, which you must do until they reach adulthood. But to all others, your relationship is now put into doubt. There are circumstances where you will have to care for an elderly or infirm parent, and that is appropriate. But beyond this, you are building your allegiance to God, and that will challenge your allegiance to others and their hold upon you. For many people, this is the most difficult challenge, the first great threshold in their preparation.</p>
<p>Do not explain yourself to others. Just say that there are deeper currents in your life and you are trying to follow them. There is deeper movement within your heart and you are trying to follow that. Tell them that you need time alone, time of quiet, time of retreat, time of re-evaluation. And do not feel that you must respond to their persistent questions. You do not have to give them answers. Spare yourself the agony of trying to do this.</p>
<p>At some point, it will be necessary for you to study the pathway that the New Message has provided, to take the steps to Knowledge, to read the Wisdom from the Greater Community, to learn about Greater Community Spirituality. This will be like food to you, food for your heart, food for your soul. You will need this now because this will give you strength and will confirm the greater movement of your life. It will give it greater clarity, greater definition, and will show you that this corner that you have turned represents your destiny and is not simply an accident in life. It is life itself moving within you now. And the New Message will resonate with your deeper nature, a nature that is now slowly emerging within you. And this will bring new people into your life, people who also are turning a corner and have begun a greater journey.</p>
<p>It is important here that you not have firm beliefs. You do not need to accept firm beliefs. You are looking for a deeper experience now. The experience will be your foundation, not firm beliefs. You are escaping firm beliefs. You are venturing into a greater realm of revelation and natural experience. Everyone at the bottom of the mountain is entertaining firm beliefs, but firm beliefs do not enable you to get up this mountain and do not enable you to gain a higher elevation where you can see the truth of life around you as it will become evident. Do not adopt firm beliefs. If you feel insecure, if you are unsure of yourself, it is fine; it is natural. Let the explanation be open. Do not attach yourself to a whole new set of beliefs. That is like going from one prison cell to another. Oh, it is a new place! But it is the same condition. Oh, it is new and exciting and reassuring, but it is the same old condition.</p>
<p>Allow the steps to reveal to you what the journey really is. It is not a journey that is understood by theorists or pundits or philosophers, idealists, academics or the general public. It is more of a mystical path, a deeper journey. Its revelations will happen beyond the intellect, for it is not an intellectual journey. Your intellect will grow to accommodate it. And you will learn over time to gain a greater perspective and greater wisdom about many things. But an intellectual journey it is not, for the intellect is a human invention. What created you and sent you into the world is not a human invention. What will reveal the greater life that you are destined to live and to fulfill is not a human invention. But it requires human participation, human wisdom, human ability, human trust, human discernment in order to manifest.</p>
<p>Here you do not give all your power away to God, thinking that God is going to guide you in everything. That is ridiculous! Here you give yourself a greater authority within yourself that is not of your own making, but this authority requires that you become responsible, that you become honest, that you become self-determined. It will require you to follow things that are mysterious, but most of the time you will have to be doing very practical things.</p>
<p>If you are in a relationship and you have children, do not make any sudden moves in your life. Build the strength first. Build the connection to Knowledge within yourself. Learn to listen. Take retreat. Follow your natural inclinations. Share only part of the Mystery with your husband or wife, for they may not be able to understand. Ask that they give you this time and this confidence, for things are emerging within your heart. Maintain your duties and responsibilities, but take time to be with the Presence of Knowledge within yourself. Take time to take the steps to Knowledge, to study the Steps to Knowledge and to place yourself in a position where they can reveal their greater truth to you.</p>
<p>Tell your children that there is a Greater Power within them that will guide and protect them if they listen. Share with them your insights. But do not go too far in trying to share everything, for you are trying to build strength, and if you try to share everything, you are giving your strength away. Do not try to take care of other people beyond your children or an elderly parent here, for you are gaining strength within yourself. You are learning to conserve your energy. You are fasting now, holding yourself back from giving yourself away everywhere, holding yourself in reserve.</p>
<p>Do not make any sudden decisions about your primary relationships if you are married with children, for in most cases it will be premature. A marriage here will be greatly challenged. Whether it can proceed will be determined by many things, which you may not be able to ascertain in the moment.</p>
<p>Your task is to follow the emergence of Knowledge within yourself, to be true to that, to be the recipient, to pull yourself in, to take the time it takes for a great emergence to happen within you. And do not be impatient, for it will emerge in its own time. You do not yet realize the magnitude of what is happening or how great its possibilities for the future will be.</p>
<p>Limit the influences around you. Be silent with those who proclaim themselves or have great judgments upon the world. Do not enter into debate at this point. Do not contend with others. Do not argue the issues. Do not assert your ideas. That is not important now and will be counterproductive for you.</p>
<p>The power and the presence of Knowledge is emerging within you. That is the most important thing. You are learning to become strong and inner directed within yourself. That is the most important thing. Maintain your duties. Provide for your children. But hold this as the most important thing, for ultimately your greatest relationship is with God. Your greatest responsibility is to the Knowledge that God has placed within you to respond to, to follow and to express. This is an unparalleled freedom, but it requires great inner strength and forbearance.</p>
<p>These are guidelines for the beginning steps. Beyond this, you must learn to build the Four Pillars of your life—the Pillar of Relationships, the Pillar of Work, the Pillar of Health and the Pillar of Spiritual Development. You must learn of the Greater Community. You must learn about the Mental Environment. You must learn about relationships and higher purpose. This is all awaiting you. But first you must build the foundation, for without this foundation, you will not be able to penetrate the greater meaning, importance and application of these revelations that are contained within the New Message from God.</p>
<p>The foundation is so very important and requires great patience and forbearance. It is this patience and forbearance that will shift your allegiance away from your intellect and the admonitions of others to a Greater Power within you—the power of Knowledge, the power of God. You will never comprehend this power fully. You can never claim it for yourself. You will never be a master of it. You can never use it to try to be better than others. You cannot use it to get what you want. You cannot use it to gain wealth and power and pleasure. You can only learn to follow it and learn of the great journey up the mountain that was always prepared for you.</p>

<p id="date">As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on July 20, 2009<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>At this time and place, it is important to speak about the purpose of religion. Religion is part of the human experience, and any attempts that have been made to eradicate it or to minimize it have proven to be unsuccessful. For you cannot deny the reality of the human Spirit. You cannot deny the fundamental reality that there is a greater spiritual need in people that must be expressed. But like all things in the world, that which is natural and essential can become distorted, misaligned and misused, allied with other purposes, particularly when these natural impulses become connected with governments and powerful forces in society.</p>
<p>Simply said, the purpose of religion is to cultivate the desire and the capacity to experience the Divine Presence in one’s life. All teachings and rituals, whether within large institutions or within the privacy of one’s home, [are] for this purpose. And the desire and capacity to experience the Divine Presence [are] to bring one to the power of Knowledge that the Creator of all life has placed within each human heart.</p>
<p>Yet when you look about, either at home or in foreign lands, you will find there is a great poverty, a great poverty in that people’s lives are not demonstrating this Presence and the power of this Knowledge. The look of disappointment and dissatisfaction, the sense of regret in the older people, the sense of hopelessness and discouragement in the young [are] evidence that this Power and this Presence are not being experienced. Religion has become now a yoke and a harness for people, requiring them to believe along certain prescribed lines of thought and to behave along certain prescribed lines of behavior. But this is far from the essence of what religion is really for.</p>
<p>To require, either through inducement or threat, for people to adhere to a certain system of belief does not represent the essence and purpose of religion. Yet that is what is so manifest in the world today. Religion has become another form of government—a form of government that seeks power and domination, a form of government that seeks to overcome its competing rivals, the competing agendas of other religions and faiths. And so there is a contest and a kind of war exerted between the most radical elements of these systems of belief. But this is not what religion really is.</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has initiated all of the world’s religions, but they have all been altered by people and governments, by cultures and traditions and by the competition for power in the world. That is why there are so many people today in the world who, though they have genuine spiritual needs and yearnings, are so put off by the manifestations of religion as it has become. Where can you find the cultivation of one’s inner life? Where is the emphasis on recognizing, following and embracing the power and the presence of Knowledge within the individual? Where is the emphasis on developing and encouraging the individual’s capacity and desire to experience the mystery of the Divine Presence—a mystery that defies all religious teachings and conventions? Where are such things being encouraged for the individual? You visit the church or the temple or the mosque and what is presented but an emphasis on upholding the ideology of religion, the institutions of religion [and] the demands of religion? This emphasis is out of context and out of relationship with the essential purpose of religion.</p>
<p>In essence, all religion is to teach The Way of Knowledge, to bring the individual into the direct experience of Knowledge, the deeper mind beyond the intellect, the mind that God has provided each person to guide them, to protect them and to lead them to a greater life and expression in the world. But you do not hear this emphasis. Instead, there is the encouragement to believe, to adhere, to follow the prescriptions of a religious tradition, however illogical and unreasonable those prescriptions may be within the context of modern life. And this is called “the Word of God,” God’s will for humanity. Of course, there is great competition between competing powers over who has the ultimate and final claim of God’s will and prescription for humanity.</p>
<p>It is as if the unreligious have taken over the business of religion for their own purposes. Never having realized its essential purpose and meaning, they have turned it into something else. It is like now a political party, and of course religion has political aims as well.</p>
<p>This is so far apart from God’s initial impulse and intention for religion—to keep Knowledge alive in the world, to teach The Way of Knowledge, to encourage human responsibility and ethical behavior, not simply as a prescript or as a requirement for admission into Heaven or some other exalted future state. It is really a denial of the natural integrity and natural ethics that will arise with the person who has experienced this power and presence of Knowledge and is guided by its wisdom and its grace.</p>
<p>These individuals, no matter what part of the world they reside, no matter what tribe or group or culture they come from, will all uphold the same values because these are the values of Knowledge. And so you have a world that seems deeply religious, but is not practicing and emphasizing what religion is really for. And given the submission and oppression of peoples throughout human history, whatever sacred intent has been maintained has been maintained only for the elite, for the monastic, for the adept.</p>
<p>As a result, God’s true Messengers have had to break the chains of convention, have had to teach in opposition in the face of the prevailing religious beliefs and attitudes. They have had to become rebels and reformers, counteracting humanity’s tendency to turn what is sacred into what is profane. What is the intent of the true Messenger but to evoke the spiritual fire in the individual and to bring them in contact with the deeper conscience that exists within them—a conscience that is not the product of social conformation or social expectation, but a deeper conscience that is innate and essential to the human life?</p>
<p>So you have a world that is religious, but knows not of religion. You have a world where religious institutions and their advocates clash and compete with one another, not realizing that the Source of their faith is the same. They will have people demanding and expecting adherence to ideas and beliefs and admonitions, but who themselves have never received the real initiation into the mystery and the power of the Presence.</p>
<p>Religion has become concrete. It has become political. It has become an economic and social power that seeks to preserve its status and its power at whatever cost. So those who are truly responding to religion’s true purpose now find themselves in exile, now find themselves heretics and visionaries following the Mystery—a Mystery that has been lost to so many in the religious orders and institutions. It is as if religion has become the enemy of what religion is really for. It is now the religion of the state, religion of tradition, religion of history, religion of fixed ideas, fixed beliefs and exclusive claims of authority. So far this is from the desire and intent of the Creator to keep Knowledge alive in the world.</p>
<p>In certain cases, religion has become the enemy of Knowledge, declaring that only God has Knowledge and that people are foolish and must be corralled like animals, must be programmed and conditioned to believe—to believe things that are incredible and impossible, to believe things that run counter to the deeper experience that people have, things that are apart from the real mystery and the profound experience that is the essence of what religion really is.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, the mystics, the wise amongst them, have kept this Power and this Presence alive, but they were the outcasts, at the margin of religious institutions. They were the rebels and the reformers who, though disapproved of or distrusted by their authorities, actually gave life and substance and meaning to the empty religious practices that prevailed in human society.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for you? This means that there is a Greater Power in your life, a greater mystery in your life, and that your connection to God is through Knowledge—the deeper intelligence that God has placed within you, an intelligence that is beyond the realm and the reach of your intellect. This Power is calling to you, and your response to it represents the deepest need of your soul—a need that is deeper than the need for survival and gratification, for education and opportunity, for friendship and partnership.</p>
<p>To find this need, you must realize that what the world is providing is inadequate. It meets social and psychological needs. It meets practical needs. But it does not meet the real need of the soul. That requires an engagement of an extraordinary kind.</p>
<p>The Creator of all life of course understands this predicament—that religion has become the problem and not the answer, that religion has become the impediment and not the pathway, that the true purpose and emphasis of religion has been lost in so many ways, that now only a very wise and exceptional teacher within a faith tradition can speak to the mystery and the power and refer to the deeper conscience within the individual. But such teachers are rare. They represent the minority of those who claim ecclesiastical powers and authorities. For how can you be allegiant to the church or to the mosque or the temple if your greatest allegiance is to Knowledge, which represents your allegiance to God? And if God is not bound by human thought, human philosophy and human theology, then you as a follower of Knowledge will not be bound by these either. This makes you free and uncontrollable. This makes you perceptive and more incorruptible. This makes you question the value of religious authority and the ethics and behavior of religious institutions—all things that religious institutions are prone to resist and to repress.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is necessary that you come back to what is essential, to the initial impulse and power of religion—not the religion of the state, not the religion of the traditional institutions necessarily, but to something much purer that can exist within them and beyond them.</p>
<p>Beware of beliefs that seem set in stone. Beware of proclamations of exclusive privilege or authority by religious leaders. Recognize that there are people who are freedom oriented and there are people who are control oriented. And the control oriented are afraid of freedom, and they are afraid of Mystery because they do not believe in the essential goodness of the human spirit. They have lost their faith in humanity and have placed all their faith in their ideology and their prescriptions that they believe have come from God. But God has only given recommendations through the great Teachers, not rules—recommendations for living, guidelines for living to help people orient their lives correctly and productively and beneficially.</p>
<p>Therefore, to find your real connection, you must come to learn The Way of Knowledge, for at the heart of every religion, there is The Way of Knowledge. This is not the way of belief. This is not the way of obedience. This is not the way of blindly following [the] prescriptions and precepts and admonitions of religious leaders and institutions. It is finding the power and the presence of Knowledge within you and learning over time and through instruction how to discern this Power and Presence from the other impulses and compulsions that exist within you as an individual.</p>
<p>God’s purpose in the world is to keep Knowledge alive so that human freedom, human justice [and] human compassion may be kept alive in the world. God’s purpose is not to exalt religious leaders or institutions, or to crown one over another. These are human creations and not God creations, and they are fallible and prone to corruption as a result.</p>
<p>God has provided a New Message into the world to clarify this picture and to provide a clear pathway for those who seek to have the real experience, and they can have this experience within their religious traditions or outside of them.</p>
<p>God’s New Revelation may conflict with political ideology and longstanding beliefs, but that is what happens when what is pure is contrasted with what has been altered and adapted. God is not bound by human creations, human beliefs and admonitions. God only provides what is real and essential to ignite the human heart and to give each individual a foundation for being inner-directed rather than outer-directed. Here your imam or your rabbi or your priest can help you if they are guided by Knowledge. But they will hinder you if they are not. You must learn to see the difference.</p>
<p>Religions are institutions that have to be maintained and protected. They are in competition with each other, so none of them that exist in the world today can really foster human peace and human unity, for they all claim special privileges, and only those few individuals within them that support a great ecumenical movement and the acceptance of all world’s religions can counteract this competition, which is inherently divisive and destructive.</p>
<p>In these words, we speak to the human heart, not to the intellect that wants to have everything figured out and wants to adhere to its notions, its beliefs and its traditions. There is nothing wrong with a tradition if it fulfills the basic purpose of religion, which is to inspire and expand people’s desire and capacity to experience the presence of God and to connect them with the deeper intelligence that God has placed within them that will be essential for their success and their well-being in the world. This is much more important than the teachings of the founder of a religious tradition. It is much more important than the religion’s official declarations of belief or doctrinaires.</p>
<p>People celebrate and worship and repeat endlessly the lives of the great Teachers, but can they really live the lives that these Teachers promoted? It is not merely human behavior that is important, for people can behave well for all the wrong reasons. People can fall in line with each other for social advantage, for economic advantage and to achieve social status and acceptance, but this is not religion.</p>
<p>You who seek to know your greater purpose in the world and the greater meaning of your life are a religious person. Whether you belong to a church or a mosque or a synagogue or any other religious organization, that is secondary. Promoting a religious ideology in the world does not represent supporting God’s will and purpose here. It is only if this ideology and system of belief can meet the basic requirements of religion that they have real and lasting value and produce real benefit for people.</p>
<p>Likewise, no religious teaching should promote war and attack upon other groups. This represents competition for power between these groups, but this is not what religion is. Religion is bringing you to God and to what God has placed within you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to your great accomplishments in life. Anything beyond this is an invention—a human invention, an adaptation. People will have to figure out what this means in terms of the application of law and the running of societies.</p>
<p>God is not here to run societies or to carry out the intricacies of jurisprudence or the administration of the law. God is pointing you to the Mystery, not to the manifestation. God is calling you to the Mystery, not prescribing the manifestation. If you want to have more saints in the world, if you want to have truly inspiring individuals in the world, if you want humanity to have a higher standard that is born not out of an oppressive regime, but out of a natural understanding, then you must guide people to the power of the Mystery.</p>
<p>Religion, you see, does not have an answer for every social and political problem, but it does give people access to the deeper intelligence that can guide people effectively in meeting all these needs. Religion must be free of the state; [it] must be free of politics, which will only taint and corrupt it to the point where those who claim to be holy men will call for the execution of people.</p>
<p>This is the degree of distortion and aberrancy that has been established in the world today, and that is why there is a New Message from God—to restore the clarity and the purpose of religion, the meaning of spiritual practice and the nature of the Divine Revelation that must happen within each person. It is not enough to celebrate a great Teacher’s revelation if you cannot find access to your own. It is not enough to worship a great teacher or emancipator unless you can find this power and this presence within your life, which will apply itself in far more mundane and simple day-to-day circumstances.</p>
<p>Here the contrast is significant. Here the contrast is significant and must be comprehended. If you want religion to be a thing, you will lose its essence and its meaning and turn it into something that it was never meant to be. If you want to turn religion into a set of ideals or beliefs or a complex theology, you will lose what religion really is and what it is for. To argue whether Jesus or Mohammed is the greatest Teacher or provides the final word for humanity is so utterly ridiculous and so far from the nature and intent of religion as God intended it to be that it represents a kind of pathetic diminishing and distortion of what religion really is.</p>
<p>To think that Mohammed gave the final Revelation is to misunderstand God’s purpose and presence, for God has many more things to say to the world, particularly at this great turning point when humanity is facing a declining world, a world of declining resources, when humanity is facing the reality of contact with intelligent life in the universe—two great events that none of God’s previous Revelations are meant to address or that can address sufficiently [and] reasonably.</p>
<p>Religion has become overlaid with ideas, beliefs, institutions, laws and requirements that have become repressive to the people or abhorrent to people who are more freedom loving. They do not meet the deeper need of the soul. That is why you must come back to what is essential, to what is real.</p>
<p>The temple, the mosque, the church and the tribal place of worship are the places to honor the Mystery and to evoke the Presence and the Power.</p>
<p>The Way of Knowledge, which is at the heart of all the world’s religions, must become its essential teaching, instead of a focus for clerics and monastics and exceptional individuals only. This is the challenge before you, or religion will be part of the problem for humanity and not its essential means of reconciliation, inspiration and a high ethical awareness. Let this be your understanding.</p>

<p id="date">As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on September 8, 2008<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>The world is driven by powerful geologic and biologic forces. They were set in motion at the beginning of the physical Universe. God has set them in motion to operate on their own, moving in a certain direction. This has produced immense turbulence, even after the creation of <em>this</em> planet. These turbulent forces work throughout the Universe, depending on a world’s particular environment.</p>
<p>Humanity has had to endure violent weather, droughts, floods, pestilence—all manner of things because this is all part of living within a changing environment governed by physical laws &amp; natural laws. Entirely different this is from your Ancient Home, from which you have come and to which you will return.</p>
<p>To be in an environment like this requires constant adaptation and constant problem solving. It is not easy. And while the world is beautiful and magnificent, it is also hazardous and difficult, placing great requirements on all intelligent creatures who live here, on all biological entities, but particularly upon those who are self-aware and who are aware of the future and the past.</p>
<p>The fact that your life here is temporary and that your physical vehicle is temporary, as you experience being in the world, this places a further burden on you—a psychological burden now, and a great anxiety about the possibility of future difficulty and even the loss of your life.</p>
<p>This is not a punishment from God, but it does represent what life means if you are living apart from God, if you are living in Separation. Life will be changing. Life will be difficult. It will be a life unlike your Ancient Home, unlike your heavenly state, and you will have to face many adversities.</p>
<p>Now humanity is facing Great Waves of change—changing climate, violent weather, diminishing resources, environmental degradation, mounting economic and political instability and a greater risk of conflict and war over the remaining resources.</p>
<p>You have come into the world to live in the face of these Great Waves of change, and these Great Waves of change are already occurring in the world today. Perhaps you have not faced them yet. Perhaps you are yet unaware of the magnitude of the Great Waves of change. This is now having a great impact, altering the balance of the natural environment, setting in train forces of change in your climate, creating greater disasters—hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and droughts, extreme and violent weather conditions in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>Humanity’s overuse and abuse of the world is now changing the natural balance, and this change is not in your favor. And even at this moment, nations and peoples do not seem to comprehend the magnitude of what is happening. People do not want to give up their privileges. Networks of trade and the exploitation of resources are now well established. People do not want to restrain themselves. In certain wealthy nations, limits will be placed, but in other nations, there are no such limits and no such restraints.</p>
<p>This means that humanity will further impact the natural environment, and the natural environment will further impact humanity. In the end, of course, nature will be victorious, but this creates a dilemma, you see, a fundamental dilemma because greater than your national laws, greater than your social customs, greater than your religious beliefs, greater than your individual or national attitudes or perspective is your fundamental relationship with nature—your relationship with your environment.</p>
<p>Humanity as a whole has lost touch with this, has lost the recognition of the power and the importance of your relationship with your environment. You feel that with technology you can overcome the forces of nature, and to a certain degree, you can harness these forces, but you cannot overcome them. Throughout the Universe, powerful nations have tried but have only found themselves to be at the mercy of the greater powers and forces of nature.</p>
<p>At this moment, humanity, like an adolescent, is giddy with its own power, thinking that it has the ability to transcend the natural world, to create an environment not subject to the forces of nature. But this is not true. And you are experiencing, even at this moment, the powerful response, the powerful reaction of natural law to human abuse and human irresponsibility, and the results are tragic.</p>
<p>Your planet is getting warmer. Hotter. Drier. It is driving change. The world will change to a new kind of balance, but it will not be a balance that will be favorable to the human family. And the only way to alter this and to prevent this outcome would be a radical change in human behavior and activity and governance, which are unlikely to happen any time soon.</p>
<p>Even in your separated state, you have to submit to the forces that govern your life. You can control them up to a point. You can mitigate the hazards. You can develop the opportunities. Perhaps even for a brief period, you can create great affluence for a large portion of the human family. But, in the end, nature will be dominant.</p>
<p>If humanity exhausts the resources of this world, it will fall under the persuasion of foreign powers in the Universe who will seek to exploit a weak and divided humanity. They will seek to gain control of the world’s natural beauty and resources, a world rich with biological diversity, a world highly valued by others.</p>
<p>They will not come now because they will not use force. Force is not the strength they will use. It will be the force of persuasion, and the more destitute humanity becomes as a result of its own behavior, the more powerful this persuasion will be and the less humanity will be able to resist the temptation of the offerings of those who come under the pretension of being here for peaceful purposes, but who in fact are here to take advantage of you and your situation.</p>
<p>These forces will be small, but clever. They will see that you have robbed yourself, and that now you are poor, and that you will not be in a position to resist the temptation of what they have to offer—stability, security, resources, things that you have given away, things that have been sacrificed here on Earth.</p>
<p>And these forces will not come in great masses or great numbers. It will only take small groups of individuals to gain pre-eminence in this world, under the conditions of human degradation. This does not have to be your fate. This does not have to be your destiny. This is not meant to be! It is a result of the decisions—countless decisions made, previously, decisions being made today and the decisions being made tomorrow.</p>
<p>Already, forces of change have been unleashed on the world, which will alter, in some cases radically, the circumstances of large parts of the human family. Even if you were to alter course, even if you were to restrain yourself and your activities, you have already set in motion forces you cannot change.</p>
<p>You may call these forces “acts of God”. You may think that God is bringing violent weather and drought conditions as a kind of punishment, but it is not true. These represent your impact upon the environment.</p>
<p>If you empty the well, the well is dry. If you do not farm correctly, the soil blows away. If you burn too many things into the environment, the weather changes. If you overexploit the world for resources, the resources disappear. It does not take a genius to figure this out. It takes common sense, but common sense is not common, it seems. And so here you are facing the consequences of humanity’s destructive impact upon the world, and these impacts will continue.</p>
<p>God is not creating them though God has created the mechanisms of life and set in motion the geological forces that have shaped the physical Universe and continue to shape it in an evolutionary pattern. You can blame God for the fact that there are hurricanes. “Why did you create hurricanes?” you may ask, but God only created the conditions under which hurricanes emerge. That was before there was any life in this world. But God did not create <em>this</em> hurricane to punish humanity. This is foolishness. This is ignorance.</p>
<p>If humanity continues in its present course, it will generate more events of this kind. Large parts of the world will be heavily damaged, and great droughts will fall upon the arid regions, driving people out. Nations will collapse. There will be millions of refugees with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>Humanity will lose its most valuable resources through overexploitation, through ignorant use, through a heedlessness of the future. Not thinking ahead, humanity is going to take everything now, robbing your children of their future, creating a future of unimaginable difficulties. There is no punishment here. It is merely consequence.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to learn of the natural world and to use it effectively, in a manner that can be sustained. This has been learned throughout the ages. It is not a new learning. But humanity has forfeited this Knowledge out of greed, out of corruption, out of ambition, and now the world has a great many people in it. The boat is full.</p>
<p>How will you manage such circumstances? How will you face the Great Waves of change? How can you bring and restore greater balance in the natural world for your benefit? The answer is beyond your intellect though you may have very good ideas, and there are many solutions that are being proposed that will be very helpful over all if brought together and if utilized fully, but really the answer to these questions has to go deeper than the intellect, deeper into <em>you</em>. It is not a problem for other people to solve for you. It is a problem for everyone. It is not merely a problem for governments, or for science, or for politicians. It is a problem for everyone.</p>
<p>This represents your relationship with nature. If you violate the relationship, you will have a bad relationship. It will be unhealthy. It will be unstable. There will be friction. There will be difficulty. Just like you having a relationship with another person, if you abuse that person, if you do not respect that person, they will behave in a manner and will respond in a manner that will be unpleasant and discordant. There will be difficulties between you. You will not function in harmony together.</p>
<p>It is like this with your relationship with nature. If you show no respect for nature, if you do not respect how it functions and how you must behave within this relationship, then the relationship becomes discordant—producing unwanted results, unpleasant experiences.</p>
<p>If you don’t take care of your home, it ceases to be a desirable place to live. If your house is falling apart, if you cannot or will not keep it up, it becomes an undesirable place to live. The world represents the home of humanity. If it is not supported and sustained and managed properly, as far as you <em>can</em> manage it, it ceases to become a desirable place to live.</p>
<p>You cannot change the laws of nature. You can limit the impact of nature’s difficulties. You can enhance and develop its opportunities and its benefits. You can utilize natural forces to your benefit, as has humanity. That is what humanity has been doing all along, but it is a balance. And humanity has lost the balance.</p>
<p>Gaining technology has given you a sense of pre-eminence, and you have taken it too far. If humanity were intelligent, you would be rationing fuel today and not waiting for when rationing will be forced upon you. You would be preserving your finest energy and resources instead of using them up as quickly as possible, believing, assuming, that there will be something there to replace them, without any difficulty in transition.</p>
<p>But humanity has created a style of living that far exceeds the carrying capacity of your environment and which places you out of balance with the natural world, and even places you out of harmony with your own nature. Now you are driven to excess—excessive behavior, excessive busyness, excessive use of the world’s resources, excessive indulgences.</p>
<p>Your relationship with time has changed. Your relationship with nature has changed. And your relationship with one another has changed. Now you are busy trying to sustain a lifestyle that deprives most of the human family—where the very rich are driving the engine of war, robbing nations and peoples of their own sustaining resources, driving headlong as if you did not have a future, as if you did not care, under a whole array of assumptions that somehow your technology and your cleverness and ingenuity will find a way to keep it all going.</p>
<p>You have abandoned your relationship with nature. You have taken on a mistress of technology, forcing a kind of adultery that has set you out of accord with yourself, with one another and with your environment.</p>
<p>And God will not intervene to stop all of this. God will only encourage you to behave correctly, for God has placed a deeper Knowledge within each person through which the will and the power of God can flow, but people have lost their native sense. They have forfeited their relationship with this deeper Knowledge to have, and to be and to do what they want—driven by passion and fantasy, driven by a new set of needs now that far exceeds your basic needs of living in the world.</p>
<p>And so God speaks, but you cannot hear. You cannot feel, except perhaps superficially or periodically, the restraints that God is trying to place upon your actions and the motivation that God is giving you for other kinds of action. It is as if you are out of control and cannot stop yourself, like a person who is eating but cannot stop eating even though they have far exceeded already the needs of the body. Now they keep eating to satiate some kind of emotional insecurity, some kind of sense of deficiency and loss within themselves.</p>
<p>While God has created this immense physical reality, God has also placed Knowledge within you to teach you how to live in it and to give you the opportunity to re-experience your connection with your Ancient Home, even while you are here, <em>especially</em> while you are here. You can’t return to your Ancient Home if your mind is set in Separation. You do not simply die and go to Heaven. You have to prepare for your Ancient Home, and that provides you a greater purpose for being in this physical reality, with all of its difficulties and challenges.</p>
<p>You may look at nature aesthetically, marveling at its magnificence, its beauty, its diversity, its splendor, its complexity and, indeed, nature provides all of these things, but you still have to survive within it, and survival is not easy. Perhaps your technology has made it seem easy, but that just means that other people are doing the work for you or that machines are doing the work for you, but you must feed these machines energy, and the greater the number of machines feeding you, the more energy they all require.</p>
<p>What can restore you to your real balance living in the world? And what can prepare you for your Ancient Home? And what can give you power, certainty and strength to counteract all of your other tendencies and the other tendencies of people around you?</p>
<p>Your intellect does not have an answer for this, for the answer comes from beyond human creation and imagination. God has placed a deeper Knowledge within you. Only it knows the way out of your dilemma, and the more that you take the steps to Knowledge and experience your connection to Knowledge, the more your activities will fall in line with the harmony of the natural world, and you will be drawn away from behaviors that are harming this relationship and that are creating a future that will be undesirable and in some cases unlivable.</p>
<p>All of the forces that are driving humanity to its own demise are counteracted by the presence and the power of Knowledge. What will restrain people from destroying their natural inheritance here? Good ideas? Reform movements? These will not be strong enough to counteract what has been set in motion by human greed and human ignorance. It will have to be a more powerful force.</p>
<p>What can take people out of addiction but a force that is more powerful than the addiction? What can stop humanity’s desecration of the world? What can stop humanity from overspending its natural inheritance? What can stop war? What can stop human cruelty? What can mitigate and eventually stop all of the actions that are endangering your future and that are already setting the natural world against you?</p>
<p>It must be a more powerful force. You know you should not do things, but you do them anyway. You know you should not be living a certain way, but you live it anyway. You know that perhaps you have an unhealthy relationship with work or with other people, but you do not change course. You know you are unhappy, but you will not alter the circumstances that are bringing this unhappiness to you. Why is this?</p>
<p>There are many answers, of course, but in the end it will take a more powerful force to alter the momentum of your life—the obligations, the attachments and the associations you make with yourself, with other people and with the whole world, that are sending your life in the direction of disaster. There must be a more powerful force, and where will that come from?</p>
<p>Within you, you have strength and you have weakness. You have wisdom and you have ignorance. That which is strong and wise within you must be predominant if you are to experience the great benefits that this will yield.</p>
<p>God has placed a deeper Knowledge within you. It is the source of your integrity and your wisdom and your ability to see the truth and to respond to the truth. It is the source of your courage. It is the source of your strength.</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you will act foolishly and follow the foolish actions of others. You will live for the moment only, forfeiting your future and your preparation for the future. You will live selfishly, unaware or uncaring about the consequences of your actions upon others. You will try to acquire all things for yourself—pleasure, happiness, acquisitions—heedless of the consequences. You will forfeit your relationship with nature and even your relationship with your deeper nature in order to have and to fulfill the desires and the addictions and the fantasies of the mind.</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you will do these things. Perhaps you will feel guilty and uneasy about it, but you will still do it. Maybe you won’t do it to the excess of others, but you will still be drawn. You will give into fear—the fear of not having. And this fear of not having will drive you to do things that are unhealthy. You will marry the wrong people. You will take the wrong jobs. You will live in environments that aren’t right for you. You will ignore the warnings, even within yourself, about your actions. You will become addicted to people or places or things to try to fill the void and to drive out the anxiety that your behavior is creating.</p>
<p>Without Knowledge, you will do these things to some degree and maybe even to a great degree. Look around. Look how people are driven. They live lives that are desperate. They are slaves to their circumstances. They are slaves to their desires. They do not function like free people even in freer nations. They are agitated. They are fearful. They are preoccupied. They can’t sit still for five minutes. They are not aware of themselves or where their life is going. They are making terrible, sometimes ridiculous, decisions. They are giving themselves away to things that have no future. Why is this?</p>
<p>You can blame many things, of course. You can blame culture. You can blame sinful attractions. You can blame the devil. You can blame God. You can blame a million things. But fundamentally it is because you are not being guided by Knowledge.</p>
<p>The truth here is simple. It is not complex. But a simple truth is difficult to fathom. It is not so simple to understand though it is simple by nature.</p>
<p>God has given you a deeper nature. It is not out of harmony with nature around you. It knows where you need to go, what you need to do, what is healthy for you, what is unhealthy, where to give yourself, where not to give yourself, who to be with, who not to be with, what to follow in others, what not to follow in others. It is a perfect guiding system. But you must yield to it. You must discover it within your own experience. You must build a connection and relationship with it by taking the steps to Knowledge, and you must learn to follow it—beginning in things that are small and then learning how to experience and to follow it in greater and more difficult matters.</p>
<p>Knowledge within you is uncompromising. You cannot make a deal with it. It is not like your personal mind, your worldly mind that can get what it wants through negotiation, through compromise. With Knowledge, it does not work like this. When you really know something, you really know it, and you cannot change it. You may try to dismiss it or overlay it with other things. You may even run away from it.</p>
<p>That is one of the reasons people are so busy and preoccupied. They are running away from themselves. They are running away from Knowledge. They are running away from their conscience, their deeper conscience, not the conscience that is created by culture with all of its rules and guidelines. It is a deeper conscience about what is fundamentally right and not right. People are running away from this. That is why they can’t sit still for five minutes without becoming agitated and anxious and disturbed. They have to jump up and go do something. They don’t even know how to be with themselves.</p>
<p>This has really gotten out of hand, you see. And human civilization has gotten out of hand. It is wild, uncontrolled. It is like a train that is heading to the station, but it has no breaks.</p>
<p>The Great Waves of change that are coming to the world represent nature’s response, the consequences of your violation of nature and your squandering of your natural inheritance. You will have to face these consequences. And they will either defeat you or uplift you, depending upon how you respond, depending upon whether you respond with Knowledge or with idealism, compromise and greed. One leads to cooperation and unity. The other leads to conflict and breakdown.</p>
<p>This is not simply a matter for governments or policy. It has to do with how <em>you</em> see the world and how <em>you</em> respond to the world. It has to do with whether you are being guided by Knowledge or by all the other things that are the substitutes for Knowledge.</p>
<p>Your relationship with nature, then, is not simply one of admiring its beauty and its complexity. It really has to do with how you live in nature, how you work with nature. If your relationship with nature is to be more than a romance—more than romancing nature, being infatuated with its beauty—you have to deal with how you are going live <em>with</em> nature and <em>in</em> nature and to deal with its adversities and to enjoy its splendors in a working relationship. And how are you going to deal with other people and the differences with other people?</p>
<p>God has placed an answer within you. It is not an answer that is an idea alone. It is an intelligence. The more humanity becomes strong with Knowledge, the more it restrains itself from its destructive behavior and the more it fosters and creates behavior and technology, systems of social justice that are to its benefit.</p>
<p>For eventually humanity will have to outgrow its adolescent emphasis on growth and to focus on stability and security as its primary focus. This is what all the races in the Universe evolve to do. They go through their stages of growth, which usually leads to a kind of overreaching of their resources, sometimes even to destroy civilizations. But eventually they have to determine how they are going to be stable within their environment.</p>
<p>This is a very great thing. This is what the evolution of civilization really means. It is like the stages of life in a person’s life. When you are young, you want to grow and expand. You want to have more things. You want new experiences. You keep growing and expanding, growing and expanding. But if you are to become functional in a mature environment, as a mature individual, you will have to create stability. If you are to have a family, you must have stability and security. It is not so much about having new things all the time or being wild and free. Now you must attend to your basic responsibilities. You seek stability, security. This is natural.</p>
<p>It does not mean that you are not still fascinated in life and enjoying life and open to change. It simply means that you have to attend to your responsibilities of living and sustaining what you have created.</p>
<p>Eventually, humanity’s civilization, even facing a very degraded world, will have to come to terms with this. But still adolescent behavior permeates human cultures, permeates your economic systems, permeates political agendas, everything. You want more and more and more and more, but you are out of sync. You do not have a stable relationship with nature, or with each other. It is all about personal fulfillment, personal acquisition, personal wealth, personal happiness—all creating great instability.</p>
<p>The real wealth, the real happiness, will be attained by other means. God has placed Knowledge within you to guide you and to protect you and to teach you how to live in harmony with your environment and with each other. It is oriented to the truth, to what is real and genuine and authentic, what is honest and what is compassionate. It is your relationship with your deeper nature that will enable you to re-establish a real functioning relationship with the natural world—to restore a sustainable life, a balanced life. Even facing the Great Waves of change, Knowledge will lead you and guide you and help you navigate the difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>There will have to be much human innovation in the future, but if it is guided by Knowledge, it will be beneficial. You will have to alter the circumstances of your life to adapt to a world of declining resources, but Knowledge will give you the strength to do this, and you will reap rewards as a result. You may face the future with great fear and anxiety, but Knowledge within you is not afraid.</p>
<p>Knowledge’s only concern is that you will not recognize and fulfill your greater purpose for being in the world at this time. That is an underlying concern. But beyond this, Knowledge is not threatened by the things that frighten <em>you</em>, and that is why it represents your strength. It is your deeper nature. Neglect this to your own peril. Avoid this, you will face calamity. You will be unknown to yourself, and you will be without wisdom in the world. That is why returning to Knowledge is the foundation of all of your beneficial activities.</p>
<p>There will have to be a thousand things to be done to restore your balance with nature and to prevent calamity in the future for the human family, but the foundation of all of this must be Knowledge, your deeper nature.</p>
<p>There will be many arguments against this, of course: “Yes, but” this, “Yes, but” that. People will complain. They think it is inadequate. “Hah, you’re just going to rely upon some kind of intuition?” They think Knowledge is just intuition, a weak and fleeting experience. They do not take it seriously. They do not recognize its power, its immense strength.</p>
<p>People still think it is all about technology and innovation, but they cannot agree. They argue with each other over which political system is better, which social system is better. The arguments go on and on and permeate all of human culture—the disagreements, the conflicts. People fight with each other over innumerable things—with wars of words, wars of action and, in extreme cases, war itself.</p>
<p>But within you is the great power that is not in conflict with itself. You cannot be at war with another at the level of Knowledge. You will recognize your mutual needs and will try to satisfy them or address them together. And even your different opinions about what may or may not work will be counteracted by the presence of Knowledge. You will commit yourself to solutions even if those solutions prove to be difficult to recognize and to achieve because you will be guided by Knowledge. You will restrain your behavior. Nations will restrain their behavior, if guided by Knowledge, if guided by people who are strong with Knowledge.</p>
<p>Natural disasters will occur. You will know how to prepare for them. But what must stop, what must be arrested is humanity’s abuse of its natural inheritance. What does this look like? you might ask.</p>
<p>Half the world’s forests should be preserved. Fuel should be rationed. It should have been rationed twenty years ago. You will have to control human population growth and human consumption if you are ever able to attain stability and security. You cannot devour the Earth without losing the ability to live here. And you cannot migrate to other planets because they are owned by others. Beyond this solar system, it is private property. You must put your house in order, and God has given you the power, the strength and the wisdom to do this.</p>
<p>You have to begin with taking the steps to Knowledge and with re-evaluating your life. Before you commit yourself to other actions, you must do this, or you will not have a foundation, and you will not be able to experience the source of your wisdom, your power and your strength. You will launch yourself on some kind of campaign of reform, but you will not really have the power and the strength and the wisdom that you will need to be successful.</p>
<p>For that, you must come to Knowledge within yourself. That is where you must begin. You begin with what is essential and fundamental. You learn to be still so you can experience Knowledge and feel its presence and hear its guidance, so you can feel its restraint and its motivations. You step out of the world of over-stimulation into a deeper, more quiet world within yourself. And you will find that there is a greater strength within you waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p id="date">As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 16, 2008<br />
in Tehran, Iran</p>
<p>God watches over the world, for the world is a troubled place. It has always been so. That is why you have come to the world. It is a place where God has been forgotten, and your true nature has been forgotten. It is a place of competition and conflict, where life is difficult, where you must constantly solve the problems of your daily existence. It is a place where people seem foreign to one another and foreign to themselves, as God has created them.</p>
<p>It is a place of appearances. It is a place of sensation. It is wonderful and dangerous, beautiful but confusing. It is where the separated have come to live, to learn how to give again and to bridge the gap so that the separation may be ended in time.</p>
<p>No one has come here by accident. Everyone has been sent for a purpose. This purpose remains undiscovered within you, but you must find it, for that is the great pursuit in life. Beyond meeting your basic requirements to exist in this reality, you must find this purpose, for this is how God will speak to you, and this is how you will find your way.</p>
<p>The Plan of God is so very simple that it escapes people’s comprehension, yet it is mysterious because it does not fit in with human expectations. It does not fit in with human beliefs and traditions. It is beyond comprehension, and yet it is very simple.</p>
<p>For God speaks to the world through a deeper Knowledge within the individual and through the power of united relationships, where this deeper power can be expressed and experienced between two or more people.</p>
<p>Periodically, God speaks to the world to deliver a message to the world. This is very infrequent, perhaps only happening every few centuries. God’s Message to the world is meant to last for a very long time and is meant to affect and influence the minds and hearts of people for a very long time. These Messages are given at pivotal points in evolution and at great times of change and times of great need.</p>
<p>The meaning of this is beyond your current references, for you do not see yet the great need of humanity and why a New Message from God would be sent into the world for the world itself.</p>
<p>For while God speaks to you through a deeper Knowledge within yourself and through the power of united relationships, God’s Message to the world is to prepare humanity for what it cannot see and cannot know. It is to warn humanity. It is to empower humanity. It is to prepare humanity.</p>
<p>You can only be a witness to this. It will be beyond your current ideas. It will transcend your understanding. But God is not trying to reach your intellect as much as to resonate within you at a deeper level. For the intellect was created to navigate and to comprehend physical things, particular things. But the deeper resonance is of the soul, and that is how you will respond to God’s great but infrequent Messages for humanity.</p>
<p>People have many questions, but they must learn to listen at a deeper level, to still their minds and to listen, to be present, to be observant, to be reverent. For the intellect cannot know for sure if a New Message from God is authentic. They cannot know for sure if what they are hearing is absolutely the truth, the greater truth from the Creator of all life. They cannot know with the intellect if the Messenger is the real Messenger.</p>
<p>But in their heart they will know. The resonance will be deeper. The recognition will emerge from a deeper awareness within you and within others. This is what has kept religion alive. It is this deeper resonance. It is not the power of belief, for belief is weak and fallible, easily manipulated by others—by other powers and forces and so forth. But the resonance that keeps people responding to God’s great Messages is happening at a deeper level within the individual, beyond their intellect, beyond their ideas and comprehension, and this is what gives it power and magnificence, you see.</p>
<p>But if you cannot respond at this deeper level, well, then it becomes a matter of ideology, of belief, of social and political adherence. It becomes a matter of conformity and the expectations of others. You are expected to believe, so you believe. You are expected to pray, so you pray. You are expected to follow the requirements that have been set down before, mostly by human beings of course.</p>
<p>For God speaks to you at a deeper level. God speaks to the world through these great Messages. They are beyond the immediate needs of the individual. They encompass the needs of humanity as a whole and for the welfare and evolution of humanity as a whole. From this you gain a sense of your place and purpose in life at this time, why you are here at this time in this place, in your particular circumstances, in your nation.</p>
<p>You must have this greater perspective; otherwise, you will not understand the larger context in which your life exists, and you will not understand the movement of the world or the signs of the world. You will think it all a reference to the past—that in some way the present and the future is a fulfillment of the past. Ideas are associated with the past. But the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you is for the present, the moment and for the future. So very different this is as an understanding.</p>
<p>God is not concerned if you have religion or not, but God is calling to you at this deeper level, you see, through the great Message for the world that is now being given to the world and through the power and the influence of Knowledge within yourself, and that happens every day, every moment, in every year, at every time, in every place.</p>
<p>Even if you read the Scriptures, and it moves you deeply, that is because of the resonance, not because of the ideas, you see? The power of God is not limited by human understanding or human ideas or the ideas of any race in the Universe, of which there are so very many.</p>
<p>God is speaking now to the world through the New Message from God, through the Messenger that has been sent to the world to prepare humanity to face a world in decline, a world whose resources are diminishing, a world where people will have to cooperate with one another and end their ceaseless conflicts, a world that is entering a dangerous period—more dangerous than any period you have ever known—a world that is facing contact with life in the Universe, a world that is facing intervention from races in the Universe who are here to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity.</p>
<p>The human family as a whole has never had to face these two great challenges—living in a world of decline, facing competition from beyond the world for who will control the world, who will be pre-eminent here. The great Messages that God has sent into the world cannot prepare you for these. That is why there is a New Message from God, you see. Never think that God has stopped communicating to the world. Never think that the final message for all time has been given. This is human presumption. This is established to protect a belief and ideology, but God watches over the world, and humanity is now facing its greatest challenge as a whole. How will it respond? How will it prepare? Will it be able to comprehend the great change that is coming? Will it fight and struggle with itself for the remaining resources? Will it unite to defend the world against foreign intervention?</p>
<p>This is a time of great decision whether humanity will fail or whether humanity will unite for its preservation and to preserve its sovereignty in this world.</p>
<p>You see right away here how far beyond your own personal preoccupations this is—beyond your daily concerns, beyond your ideas, beyond your beliefs, beyond your religious understanding, beyond your political views, beyond the need of the day. If you are only consumed with the needs of the day, well, how will you see the Great Waves of Change that are coming, that will alter the landscape? How will you read the signs of the world that speak of greater things beyond your own personal concerns? How will you know when something is about to change your life? Will you be standing on the shore when the great waves come, your back to the sea—not watching, not looking, not listening?</p>
<p>That is why God’s great Messages transcend the understanding and the awareness of the people at the time that the Great Messages are given. But you have to have a much greater perspective, to be much higher on the mountain to see the relevance and importance of this.</p>
<p>People will think God’s New Message is irrelevant. It’s impossible. It will seem to not meet their daily concern. They will not see that it is here to save humanity itself! They will not see what it really is. So it will be neglected and avoided and criticized and ridiculed. People want bread for today. They do not see that when God speaks to the entire world it is for the preservation of the entire world. It is for the preservation of humanity. Without this, there will not be bread for anyone in the future. That is why the New Message has been given, you see.</p>
<p>You must become still and listen with your heart here. Your ideas will be struggling. They will be struggling to keep up. They will be trying to calculate and comprehend this, but they cannot, you see. For this is not a message for the intellect. This is speaking to a deeper intelligence within you, an intelligence not created by the world but created by God to guide you, to protect you and to enable you to respond.</p>
<p>Forget your ideas of religion now, for you are facing a New Message from God. Forget the precepts from the past, for this is for the present and the future. This is to determine if humanity will have a future, a future that you could possibly desire and embrace. This is for the protection of humanity, everyone here, living in a world in decline, living in a world that is facing intervention from beyond, competition from beyond. You must see the connection. If you do not think this is important for you, then you have lost contact with life. You do not see what provides for humanity.</p>
<p>God has provided this abundant world for the human family. If it is despoiled, if it is ruined, if it is depleted, God is not going to create another world for you. You are going to have to live with the consequences, you see. If your resources are not managed and shared, preserved when necessary, well, do you think God is going to come and bring you a new world? You just pack up and move to another planet somewhere? What is your thinking here? Do you think you are alone in the Universe and no one is aware of you, that others do not desire this place for themselves?</p>
<p>This is beyond the current concerns of people—their daily focus, their work, their ideology, their beliefs, their religion, their political ideas. Governments are not meeting to discuss how humanity is going to survive within a Greater Community of intelligent life. It is not part of the public debate or conversation. People are not talking about this in the café. That is why there is a New Message from God, and that is why you must listen now because this has everything to do with your world, your future and who you are as an individual and why you were sent into the world in the first place.</p>
<p>It is this Knowledge that God has placed within you that will enable you to hear and to respond. If you are not connected to this Knowledge, well, then it will all seem like foreign ideas to you. But if you can listen with the heart, you will see and know that this is the great Message for your time and for the times to come. God will not give another Message to humanity for a long time to come. This is it! If you could not hear, well, it is a great misfortune for you. But this is it! There is no Message around the corner. There is no second version. There is no Message that is going to come and be what you want it to be. This is it.</p>
<p>This is the Voice of the New Message. It is a voice like this that has delivered the Messages throughout human history. You wonder my language. I represent all of the languages in one language. But I speak through this language to you because this is the most universal language in the world today. It has the greatest reach, the greatest possibility. My accent is all accents.</p>
<p>It is not important, you see, that you try to comprehend these things, but it is important that you listen, that you receive God’s New Message—not fight with it, not contend with it, not argue with it, not think you have to believe in it, but to listen, to stop your ceaseless grasping thoughts and listen.</p>
<p>You will only know if this is true by a deeper resonance within yourself. The challenge is upon you, you see. All the great Messengers have been denied and ridiculed, persecuted and even killed because people could not hear, they could not feel. It is the same problem today. You have a modern society, a modern technology, but the same problem exists. It is the problem of living in separation. It is the problem of being dominated by your mind and your thoughts and your beliefs. It is the problem of lack of human freedom in your societies. People are under the weight of survival and governments. Even religions become oppressive. But it is the same problem. It has always been the same problem. So the Messenger is denied, disbelieved, suspected, criticized, condemned, ignored, avoided. It is the same problem.</p>
<p>What will it take for you to realize you are living at a time of Revelation? It is in this time that a New Message from God has come into the world. Will you stand around shaking your head? Will you run away? You see, it is the same problem. How will you know? You will know because God has put the power of Knowledge within you, far beneath and beyond your ideas, your concepts, your admonitions, your traditions.</p>
<p>God is speaking to the world now. You must listen for what God has to say to the world. Stop talking. Stop thinking. Stop debating. Stop resisting. And listen. If you do not listen, you will not even know what you are responding to.</p>
<p>Humanity’s two great challenges will determine the fate and the future of everyone in the world, the fate and future of all the nations of peoples, the condition of the world itself and whether humanity will be able to maintain its sovereignty in this world. You have lived so long in isolation, you think that you are alone in the vastness of space, but the Universe is full of life. You live on a beautiful planet. There are races that are aware of it, that seek it for themselves. How will you defend it? How will you preserve it? How will you protect it? How will you maintain humanity’s ability to survive here?</p>
<p>To do this, you must become a united humanity. Your nations must cooperate. You must end your ceaseless conflicts. You must see this is born of necessity now. It is not merely an ideal or a wish. It is a necessity.</p>
<p>God is speaking to the world. This is how God speaks to the world. This is how simple it is, how pure it is. It is not sensational. It does not fit people’s expectations. It is not here as a confirmation of people’s ideas or expectations. This is how God speaks to the world. And the New Message is very great. It has taken a long time to present here. The Messenger is in the world. You must hear the Message. You must listen with your heart. You must allow God to reveal to you the state of the world and the future of humanity and the great decisions before governments and people and individuals and you as to how you will live and what you will choose and your comprehension of where humanity is going and the great challenges before you now. God provides what humanity cannot see and cannot know for its next great step in your long history here.</p>

<p id="date">As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on November 14, 2007<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>There is a New Message from God in the world, and one of the things that it calls for is the emergence of women leaders, particularly in the area of spirituality and religion. It is time now for certain women to be called into these greater roles and responsibilities, and it is important around the world in different quarters and in different religious traditions that this be allowed.</p>
<p>It will be interesting, perhaps, for you to consider that in advanced nations in the Universe—advanced nations in the Greater Community of intelligent life in which you live—that where there is a distinction between men and women, or male and female, in those particular races, the races that are not androgynous in nature, that the female is usually given priority in matters of conscience and spirituality.</p>
<p>This represents an advancement and a practical wisdom as well, for leaders within this context must essentially be providers, and they must essentially be a maintainer. The role of being a religious leader in whatever context it may exist—whether it is within a formal tradition, whether it is within a hierarchy of leadership or whether it is much more informal, dealing with smaller groups of people—it is in all cases a role primarily focused on providing and maintaining.</p>
<p>To be creative in the area of religion is only appropriate if it is to meet practical needs of people and to adapt a religious teaching to changing circumstances. And even here it must be carried out with great care, for people like to change what has been given and alter it to meet their needs, their preferences, their desires and their own self-interest. So creativity in the area of religion is actually extremely hazardous.</p>
<p>But religion itself, in whatever context it exists, must change and evolve. It must have a greater capacity to serve people who are undergoing change in their personal lives and change at the level of nations and societies as well. Indeed, even as the environmental conditions of this world change in the face of the Great Waves of Change that are coming to the world, religion will have to adapt and change as well.</p>
<p>What essentially is the role of religious leaders in nearly all situations is to be providers and maintainers. And what they are providing is not really of a material nature as much as of a spiritual nature, within the realm of a deeper experience and recognition that is possible for all human beings and other races within the Greater Community. For God has placed a deeper mind within all sentient beings—a mind that is called <em>Knowledge</em> in the New Message.</p>
<p>Clearly, women in many societies have been taking greater roles, but there is still considerable resistance, and in some traditions, it is not allowed at all. But there must be a greater recognition here of the inherent strength of women and the natural capacity they can serve in this regard. For even in current traditions, women may not serve as the recognized leaders, but they are in most cases the backbone of the religious organization and tradition itself.</p>
<p>Men should not be threatened by this, for it is an assumption of natural abilities. And while men will continue to be religious leaders, the opportunity for women should be greatly expanded. For if an individual, a woman in this case, has developed her skills in learning of the deeper mind and of responding to it appropriately—in carrying out its direction responsibly, without altering it or redefining it for herself or for the expectations of others—then as she gains this maturity and this responsibility, she can assume a greater and more natural role as a religious leader.</p>
<p>Clearly, if you look in the past century, you have seen in all of society’s evolution, in many places in the world, the rise of women to roles of prominence that were previously only assumed by men. This is a natural evolution and should be continued. There are now heads of state who are women, but they are still blocked from becoming religious leaders in many, many traditions and in many cultures. They can become the president of a nation, but not a priest or a rabbi or an imam, in many circumstances.</p>
<p>If humanity could learn from advanced races in the Universe, you would see what an error this is. You would see what other races of beings have had to learn and how they have had to cultivate their native wisdom and skills in surviving and in functioning within a Greater Community environment, which by its very nature is extremely competitive and complex. If you could learn from these examples, then you would see the wisdom of what we are saying here.</p>
<p>In many advanced societies, as we mentioned, women are the priests; they are the religious authorities. In this case, in races very different from your own, the feminine is recognized as being more receptive to the direction of Spirit, or God, while men in general—in most situations, the male aspect—are more competent in physical or practical measures.</p>
<p>This is not simply a human phenomenon or a historical precedent within this world alone. It is something that holds true throughout the Universe. In certain advanced races, the male and the female have been joined into one being to gain access to the skills that both of these aspects of Creation can provide. But that is not humanity’s reality, nor need it be, for the male and the female, the masculine and the feminine, both have tremendous assets and qualities to be cultivated and which must be cultivated.</p>
<p>Therefore, that is why this could be called the Age of Women, the rise of women—not only to positions of political prominence, not only to positions of leadership in business or commercial affairs, but really in the realm of religion and spirituality.</p>
<p>While women possess great strengths, they also have weaknesses and liabilities within the human family. They are very prone to persuasion. They are very prone to the influences of social cohesion and consent. They are very prone to the difficulties of facing disagreement and disapproval. And their anger and their issue can be over extremely petty and insignificant matters. But in spite of all this, they have a natural ability to resonate, to care for, to sustain and to maintain, and to provide the greater resources of life, which are non-material in nature.</p>
<p>For all human beings have material needs and spiritual needs. Spiritual needs cannot be met by meeting material needs, but until material needs are met, spiritual needs cannot seriously be entertained by most people. But they are different, you see. Once you have satisfied certain physical requirements of life regarding food, water, shelter, security and so forth, then you begin to entertain a greater set of needs. These are perhaps psychological and emotional in nature, but psychological needs bridge to your deeper spiritual needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the greatest spiritual need is the same within all people, and that is to find and to fulfill your specific mission in coming into the world. This holds true regardless of your culture, your religion, your family circumstances, your economic situation and so forth. But to be able to entertain this seriously and responsibly, you must have certain material needs met. That is the first requirement.</p>
<p>Because material providership historically has fallen primarily on men, women have been able to cultivate providership at other levels—at the psychological and emotional and spiritual levels to a far greater degree, and they are naturally endowed to do this. It would be foolish to think that women are going to displace men in providing, in the provision of material needs. Where women’s greatest power is the power of empathy, the power of service. They face the same problems of fear, desire and preference that men do, but they still have these natural assets in great abundance. To deny them opportunities in the realm of religion and spirituality is a great mistake and a costly one at that.</p>
<p>The affairs of the spirit are different than the commercial and material affairs of people and should not be confused. In no case should the state and religion be the same. That has proven to be disastrous in history. The great casualty of attempting to join those two is religion itself, which becomes a tool of the state, which becomes used as a form of manipulation and persuasion, of self-righteousness and condemnation of others.</p>
<p>People try to simplify things and make everything the same, but things are not the same, you see. Nature expresses itself differently within different contexts, and while there will still be women who will be marvelous leaders of commerce and political leaders, and there will still be men who will be superb at being religious teachers and leaders, there is a natural orientation that gives the feminine, the woman, the advantage.</p>
<p>Do not think, however, that if women led religion the world would be magically transformed, for this is not the case. But the opportunities to maintain religion and to maintain the spirit of religion in all traditions would be enhanced.</p>
<p>You still need people to run organizations and to deal with financial necessities and to maintain infrastructures and all of this, but the spirit of religion becomes lost when it is united with commercial and practical needs exclusively. Its ethical foundation erodes away, its spiritual emphasis erodes away, it becomes formalized, rigid, governed by rules and regulations; it becomes constrained by the governance of the state, of political powers, economic power, and the life goes out of it. It becomes stale and static and oppressive as a result.</p>
<p>There is a natural ascendancy for women in the realm of religion and politics. That is not to say that all women will ascend there, or that that will be the purpose of all women. Certainly not, but the opportunity for those who are naturally given—who have purpose, real purpose, in this arena— should be allowed the opportunity to assume a greater role.</p>
<p>Within this context of religion and spirituality you have administrators, you have providers and you have seers. Let us spend a moment speaking on this.</p>
<p>Certainly administrators are those who run organizations, who meet the practical and financial needs of organizations, who are involved in promoting the teaching or the opportunities or the benefits of an organization.</p>
<p>Providers are those who serve people in more fundamental emotional, psychological and spiritual needs, within a spiritual or religious context.</p>
<p>Seers, however, are a very rare role and require a very special preparation. If someone who has the gift of vision is not well grounded as a human being, is not strong in the Four Pillars of their life—their relationships, their health, their work and their spiritual development—their vision can be greatly misapplied and misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Over the centuries, men have been so afraid of the power of women and the possibility of women ascending within the society and culture that they really have denied themselves the assets and the benefits of these skills. And civilization as a whole has been retarded and restrained, its full potential not realized because of this.</p>
<p>There are very few individuals who can be seers and not all of them will be women, but these gifts have been given to the feminine in far greater abundance, and there are women today who are meant to be seers. That is their purpose. That is their mission. But perhaps within their cultures and societies they are assigned simply maintenance tasks within the family. They are held back by their own local religion and cultural customs. And their greater purpose is not being realized. Their great opportunity is closed to them. Just because you are born with a purpose does not mean the world will allow you to assume it. That is why freedom is so important—the freedom to think, the freedom to express, the freedom to create. But ultimately, it is the freedom to find your purpose and to fulfill it.</p>
<p>Slowly, over the past century in particular, women have been arising, representing the ascendancy of women in many cultures—not all cultures but many cultures. This is a natural evolution, as we have said. It must happen. And the human race will be far better for it. To hold women back and assign them domestic duties alone is a great mistake. It will deny the human family far greater resources that would be available otherwise.</p>
<p>The confusion about male and female roles, the masculine and the feminine, has led to a great retardation in human development and great abuse of people throughout the ages in many cultures. To limit women to child raising and domestic duties and minimal employment opportunities is a great mistake, and wherever that exists in any culture, that culture will suffer as a result. Until recently, in most societies in the world, women were considered to be simply the possession of men—a valuable possession, but a possession, something you could buy or sell or trade or destroy—and that is one of the reasons that human civilization has progressed so very slowly.</p>
<p>Why has it taken humanity so long to really make advancements? It is not simply energy and technology, the limits there, that have held you back. It is the restraint upon the roles of men and women. It is the weight of history and tradition. It is the expectations of children. So for a woman who is destined to become a provider within religion and spirituality, how will her talents ever be recognized in a culture that does not allow her to assume any roles within this context? And will she not suffer as a result of being unable to meet her culture’s expectations and demands?</p>
<p>There are many unhappy and dysfunctional people today around the world who have ended up in these conditions because their natural evolution has been stifled and repressed. And what cost to society to have dysfunctional people? What cost to society to have to pay the price of addiction and people’s many actions of self-destruction? What cost to society?</p>
<p>But the greater cost that has not been recognized is that these individuals have not been able to provide and to express their own purpose in being here and the gifts that would issue from this, which are not simply their personal creations but are actually gifts of Spirit, gifts of God.</p>
<p>Now, many women may out of ambition or insecurity aspire to be in these greater roles, but this may not be meant for them. That is a matter of recognition and should not be constrained by tribal or religious or political restraints. In many advanced cultures in the Universe, seers are recognized amongst the Ancients and are chosen and specially trained for their future roles. Providers, the same. People with technical abilities, the same. Their talents are recognized at an early age, and they are all given different forms of education to prepare them to express and to use their natural abilities.</p>
<p>One other very unfortunate aspect in restraining the ascendancy of women is that boys and girls are put together way too early. They tend to mimic each other. They compete with each other, and they are urged to assume traditional roles with each other, restraining both the young boys and the young girls from cultivating and recognizing their own natural abilities and inclinations. Everyone is expected to mate and to raise families and to have romance. So children are programmed to have romance when they are five years old through the media and through all the images of the culture. This is true in so many places today. How can people’s individual talent and ability ever be recognized under influences like this? It is like preparing all boys to be soldiers and nothing else. And the loss to society is incalculable—the loss of talent, the loss of inspiration, the loss of people’s natural direction.</p>
<p>Young men and women should have very little contact with each other until they have had time to understand themselves and have time to consider their own inclinations and strengths and sense of direction in life. Just to throw them together and to influence them to have social behaviors with one another prematurely is extremely destructive. It is difficult enough for young people to deal with all of the contrary influences of society at large than to have to deal with the opposite sex at such an early age.</p>
<p>For parents everywhere, it is important over time, instead of casting expectations and demands on the performance of their children, they should look to see what signs are being given to them from their children about their children’s inclinations and strengths, weaknesses and natural abilities. Sometimes this cannot be discerned until a person reaches young adulthood. But to give a young person the encouragement and to teach them to learn the Way of Knowledge so they can gain access to this great intelligence that God has given them is perhaps the greatest gift a parent can give a child beyond providing for their basic material needs.</p>
<p>The world today would look different if women were allowed to ascend. It would not be magically wonderful; it would have many problems still, but you would have fewer people in the world today and would be better prepared for the Great Waves of Change that are coming to the world—the deterioration of your natural environment, the change in your climate, the diminishing resources of the world and so forth. And there would be greater and wiser leadership within the realm of religion and spirituality. This is naturally taking place now as women seek to gain these opportunities, if they are available to them at all.</p>
<p>The New Message from God encourages women to ascend and to take these greater roles of responsibility. It is not power that is the emphasis here; it is responsibility. You seek greater responsibilities, not greater power. Power without responsibility is destructive. It is arrogant. It is self-serving. And it leads to great harm.</p>
<p>There will of course be great resistance from many men who have always been afraid of women and are afraid of what the rise of women could mean for them. But there is a natural ascendancy here. It is not meant to displace men or disenfranchise men or make men less than who they really are, for they have greater responsibilities too that have not yet been recognized and reclaimed.</p>
<p>The wisdom of women must come to the fore if society is to advance, if humanity is to adapt to the changing conditions of the world and if greater competition, conflict and war are to be avoided. These natural endowments must be given the freedom to emerge, not only for the well-being of the individuals involved, but also for the well-being of the whole world and all of humanity.</p>
<p>Women must become unchained, and they must unchain themselves from pettiness and ignorance and arrogance. They must learn to control their emotions. They must learn the wisdom of discernment. They must have opportunities for education. They must gain greater responsibilities in areas that were previously denied them. There must be enough trust between men and women to allow this natural emergence to take place.</p>
<p>The New Message emphasizes this because it is an important part of giving each person the opportunity to make a connection with Knowledge, the deeper intelligence that God has placed within each person. Today, most people are unaware of the presence of Knowledge and cannot respond to the guidance and protection that Knowledge provides.</p>
<p>So taking the steps to Knowledge is essential and represents the fundamental focus of all real spiritual development and religious education. To teach someone to recite the Scriptures or to praise God is not really meeting their spiritual needs. It may be important for their future role, it may be significant for them individually, but fundamentally the purpose of all spiritual development and religious education in its truest sense is to build a connection between your thinking mind, which is a product of all the world’s influences, and the deeper mind within you that God has created within you—to protect you, to guide you, to keep you from harm and to lead you to the greater purpose that has brought you into the world—a purpose that only Knowledge itself knows and understands, it being beyond the grasp of the intellect, beyond the grasp of human speculation, human ambition, human theology.</p>
<p>The mind must serve Spirit, not the other way around, in the true hierarchy of your Being. Your body serves your mind, your mind serves the Spirit, your Spirit serves God, which it is naturally designed and inclined to do. That is it. But if the mind tries to use Spirit, the mind then becomes the false leader. It cannot provide real purpose, meaning and direction. It can only reinforce structure and rules, which may be necessary, but in this sense become overbearing and oppressive. Belief takes the place of inspiration. Obedience takes the place of service. Adherence takes the place of recognition.</p>
<p>And that is why in the world today religion, in so many ways, is not serving its fundamental purpose, which is to bring people closer to God. To bring people closer to God means you are bringing them closer to what God has put within them—not to an ideal God, not to a belief in God, not to a traditional belief in God necessarily, but actually to what God has placed within them, which in the New Message is called Knowledge.</p>
<p>Only Knowledge knows who you are and why you are here, who you are seeking to find in the world, what you are seeking to accomplish, where your gift must ultimately be given, the steps that you must take along the way, the attractions you must avoid, the opportunities you must respond to, the places to go, the places not to go, the people to meet, the people not to associate with, the temptations to deny and the deeper temptation to follow within yourself the temptation given by God.</p>
<p>This challenge faces men and women equally. The obstacles to taking the steps to Knowledge face men and women equally. But women, in most places, have a greater disadvantage in just the opportunities—the value of their Knowledge is not placed very high at all. They are merely being used as tools of their families, of their culture, of their villages, of their tribes, of their nations. This must change or humanity will not advance. You will remain a primitive, tribal culture unable to function within the world of diminishing resources; prone to competition, conflict and war; and your religion will continue to be a tool of the state—bound by history and tradition and stifling to the true expression of Spirit.</p>
<p>Certainly religion today is extremely important in its ethical teachings and in maintaining and providing a pathway to experience the divine nature of each person and what that divine nature asks of each person. But religion has fallen, in so many places, under the domination of the state and, in some cases, even united with the state. That cannot be. That is essentially unhealthy.</p>
<p>All the true Messengers from God that have come into the world were Messengers that in almost all cases were free of the state. Whether they were viewed as saints or heretics, they had to operate freely from the dictates of government and culture. Perhaps they adapted their teachings so they could have an opportunity to teach and to provide, but they were operating under a very different kind of system—an inner guidance system that God has placed within them, an inner guidance system that lives within each person as their greatest potential.</p>
<p>One of the great tragedies of human poverty, which is so rampant in the world today and which has the risk of growing ever greater in the future, is that the great assets of these people will never be discovered, will never be allowed to emerge. The great scientists, the great thinkers, the great politicians, the great religious leaders, the great servants of humanity will all be kept under the yoke of poverty. And not only will their lives be sacrificed and held in a miserable state, but their societies will suffer as well. For the wisdom that societies need to advance and to progress will be denied. This, beyond human suffering, this is the tragedy of poverty.</p>
<p>You are entering the Age of Women. It is time for the emergence of women—of responsible, ethical, wise women. But they too must learn the Way of Knowledge. They too must hear the New Message from God, to understand <em>really</em> what is motivating them to take a greater role in life. This understanding exists in certain places in the world already, but it is not accessible to most people. It is rare. It is invaluable. Do not underestimate its potency.</p>
<p>Many of the great leaders in the future for humanity will have to be women. It is their destiny. It is what they must do. If this is denied, then humanity will not progress. It will remain captive to history, to tradition, to conflict and war. Being providers and maintainers, women are more given to establishing peace and cooperation. In a traditional sense, they have to make families work, they have to hold families together, they have to take care of people directly, intimately. Do you see the advantages here? Within the realm of religion and spirituality, this is where the great skills come forth. However, this occurs within a larger context. Women can still have families, but they have a greater charge to take care of people in whatever specific arena they are destined to serve.</p>
<p>Because the New Message from God has come through the Messenger, who is a man, should not discourage you from the Message that is being given here. For this man, this Messenger, recognizes the need for the power of women. If you can separate true inspiration from personal ambition, you can see the meaning of this. If you can be free from the competition for power that grips so many men and women today regarding their relationship with one another, then you can see the wisdom in this. You can see the meaning of our words. For we speak not to intellect, not to your social conditioning, not to your ambitions as a person, but we speak to your deeper nature—the nature that God has created within you—a nature which is not the product of social, political or religious conditioning but is the creation of the Divine within you. This is not simply a potential; it is a deeper intelligence, far wiser than your intellect.</p>
<p>But how few people have ever found this. How few people have ever recognized the difference between Knowledge and their thinking mind, for who you are is not your mind. It is not your ideas and beliefs. Your ideas and beliefs are just part of the way you navigate life. Who and what you are is beyond them. But how few people in the world understand this?</p>
<p>When you talk about having a relationship with yourself, you are talking about having a relationship with your mind and your body. What other self is there, but your true self?</p>
<p>The challenge for women, in part, is not to fall prey to competition for power with men, for that is merely destructive. It is not about displacing or overwhelming men, for that is destructive. It is about assuming greater responsibilities. And in some cases this means that the woman, the individual, must go forth without a man, without a family. There are no guarantees in this regard.</p>
<p>Your spiritual calling is your spiritual calling. You cannot make deals with it. Women who are called to a greater service must go unchaperoned into the future. They cannot take a man with them to protect them and to provide for them and to keep them small. Or perhaps they will have a great partnership with a man and perhaps they will not. It is up to Knowledge and to their own individual design and calling.</p>
<p>We make this point here so that women will understand that they are putting relationships with men ahead of their greater calling. This is one of the weaknesses that women have, which has been socially conditioned into them, but also represents just a normal human need. But sometimes even normal human needs must be superseded by a deeper spiritual, divine need. That must come first.</p>
<p>This is true for both men and women. If you are going to find your calling in life, you must put that in the highest priority. If your purpose for coming here requires this, then it is the greatest value. Fulfilling your social obligations or your biological urges are not as important as this, my God, for we are speaking of the need of the soul. It is the need of the soul to find its purpose and fulfill it in the world, within the circumstances of the world. <em>This</em> is what reestablishes your divine nature. <em>This</em> is what fulfills your commitment to God. <em>This</em> is what ends conflict within you. <em>This</em> is where your true nature becomes integrated. <em>This</em> is where your body serves your mind and your mind serves your Spirit, as they were designed to do. <em>This</em> is where your life comes together. <em>This</em> is where you assume greater responsibilities. <em>This</em> is what satisfies the need of the soul.</p>
<p>We are entering the Age of Women. Accept this. Embrace this. Consider it. The New Message from God will teach you the great meaning of this and why it is so important for humanity at this point in its evolution. For these are not the <em>end times</em>. These are the times for a new beginning. This is the era of human unity and cooperation, for only this will save humanity from the great peril it has created within the world and from competition from other forms of intelligent life in the Universe around you. The New Message from God describes in detail what these two great phenomena mean and why they must be met with courage and commitment.</p>
<p>The New Message has been sent into the world to prepare humanity for a future that will be unlike the past. Therefore, for women, they must have a future that has been unlike the past. And concurrently men must have a future that has been unlike the past. This is the age of human unity and cooperation because that is the great need of humanity at this time.</p>
<p>A growing humanity living in a world of diminishing resources will require this, and that is good. That is necessary. That is what will be required to minimize human suffering and to turn away from the great temptation of competition, conflict and war. Women are meant to play a greater role in this great transition, to prepare the world to be restored and to prepare humanity for its future and destiny within the Greater Community where human unity and cooperation and where the emergence of women will be required.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on June 28, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">While the world goes about its daily affairs, the Messenger must proclaim. He must proclaim God’s New Revelation, for it holds the key to so many people’s lives and future. It will initiate their calling, their greater calling, which could not be initiated by any other teaching or any other reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is here to prepare the world for the great change that is coming, the Great Waves of change—the great environmental, economic and political change—which are far greater than what people anticipate today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are many people waiting for the New Revelation, for they have not found this Initiation in the religions of the past, in the traditions of the world. They have not been able to find the deeper connection through love, through work or through any other activity. So long have they been waiting for the Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For them, it is not merely a teaching or a phenomenon. For them, it is not merely something to speculate about or to contend with or to deny and reject. To them, the Proclamation is not outrageous or unusual. It is the perfect thing. It is their Initiation. It holds their calling, speaking down the Ancient Corridors of their mind, speaking to a part of them they barely know, but which is the center of their Being and their presence in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For them, this is the greatest moment though they may not understand its full meaning or what it will require in the future. For them, this is what they have been waiting for. They were sent into the world to be at a time of great transition. They were sent into the world to be a part of building a new future. Their connection is more to the future than to the past. They are the children of the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What has occurred before, what has been revealed before, may be inspiring or beneficial to them, but it does not hold their Initiation. It does not hold their greater calling. These things do not contain what they have been looking for and waiting for, for so very long. It is their destiny, you see. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You cannot change that which was put in place before you came into the world. Though the events of the day and of the year change your circumstances and alter your opportunities, your destiny is still the same. You may fight with this. You may contend with this. You may try to replace it with great projects, great romances, great endeavors or any number of distractions and fantasies, but you cannot alter what was put within you before you came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">How it will occur, if it will occur, where it will occur may all be altered and is being altered by the changing circumstances of the world and by the shifting allegiances within people and their condition and their environment and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it is your destiny to receive the New Revelation, then you cannot find your calling anywhere else. Try as you may. Be resistant. Deny it. Stand apart. Try to find fault with it. Try to belittle it. Try to keep it at bay. But you cannot alter the fact that it holds your destiny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Your mind may speculate. Your mind will question. Your mind will think it is ridiculous; it cannot be. But your heart will know. Your soul will be activated. It is like the Voice that spoke to you before you came into the world, preparing you to enter this difficult and challenging environment. It is that Voice—like that Voice, like Our Voice—that brings the connection alive, that restores the primary focus and meaning of your life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">But at the moment of Initiation, you will not understand. It will be so confusing. So different it is from your goals, your ideas and your notions about yourself and what you are doing in the world. All of a sudden, it is like you are struck with lightning, and for a moment in the darkness, everything is illuminated. And you see the truth about your life and how far you really are from your greater purpose and calling, adrift as if you were on a raft in the ocean, carried about by the winds and the waves of the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">But God has found you as you are drifting in the vastness of the seas, found you. Like a tiny speck on the surface of the ocean, you have been found. You have been found by the Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter what your circumstances or state of mind, the calling will speak to you, for it represents your destiny. It is not someone else’s destiny. You need not worry about them. It is </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>your </em></span><span style="font-size: medium;">destiny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You may say, “What about other people? What about my spouse? What about my children? What about my dear friend?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">But God has found the speck on the ocean, and that speck is you. This is the Initiation. Mysterious it is. You cannot comprehend it with the intellect. You cannot control what it means or what it will lead you to do. It is beyond your control because God is beyond your control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Your great ideas, your firm beliefs, they all appear to be shallow and weak in the face of the Presence. Your arguments are hollow. Your rejection is without true emotion. Your denial is insincere. Your refusal lacks conviction. Because it is your Initiation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once the Initiation has been recognized, after some struggle, the journey of preparation stretches out before you. The </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Steps to Knowledge </em></span><span style="font-size: medium;">stretch out before you. The reclamation of your true life and all that that will require of you, and your current circumstances and obligations, are set out before you, step by step.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You cannot get to your purpose from where you are because you are adrift, and you have not found your safe harbor. You have not found the sight of land where your life is meant to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What a time this is then to be struck by the Revelation. Momentary it will seem, but all of a sudden, everything begins to feel different. You have had an experience that stands in contrast to your normal experiences, and it begins to create a contrast that you will carry forth with you, for nothing you can do on your own can compete with this. It is bigger than any experience that you have ever tried to have. It is greater than any goal you have ever set for yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">So you feel frightened and overwhelmed, confused, but it is okay. It is natural. To have your life so suddenly change, certainly would create confusion and disorientation. It would certainly be disillusioning to your current obsessions and distractions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once God has made God’s mark upon you, then it is not like you can erase it from your life or cover it up or make it go away or explain it or rationalize it to yourself so that its power is diminished. You are going to contend with the Revelation for you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is not by accident that you happened to come across or even hear about the New Revelation. All the forces of Heaven that support you have been trying to get you to this point of recognition and to keep you from destroying your life in the process, to limit the damage you have already done and the waste you have already created so that you would be available and be able to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Initiation may make you feel helpless and confused and highly uncertain. You might even think it is a great misfortune. But from the position and perspective of Heaven, you are the blessed amongst the few, a person who has been given the greatest opportunity. So what if it means changing your life and circumstances! What is that compared to who you are and why you have been sent?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">These things are significant to you, yes, at this moment and meaningful perhaps to others who are involved with you. But you have been given a greater opportunity, and even more than an opportunity—a calling. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once this Initiation has occurred, your journey will change, perhaps imperceptibly at the beginning, but something has altered the course of your life. You will never really be the same. Even if you spend your life denying and rejecting what has occurred, you will never be the same. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You will never be happy with simple pleasures alone. You will never be content with your former goals or distractions, hobbies or interests. Something has changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">From Heaven’s viewpoint, it is a great blessing. Finally, your life has a possibility of being redeemed. But to you it may seem very different in the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You must then cleave to the Revelation if that is your Initiation, and you will know if it is at the center of your Being. It is not an intellectual discussion with yourself. It is not a rational process. Human rationality is merely a coping mechanism to deal with an uncertain and unpredictable world. It is appropriate in certain circumstances and hopeless in others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is important that you know of the Messenger because if the Initiation occurs while he is in the world, then your opportunity becomes greater and more significant. It would be a great misfortune for you to miss him while he is here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Revelation only comes every few centuries, or perhaps once in a millennium, and you happen to be here at that time. From Heaven’s perspective, that is a great blessing, a great opportunity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">But who can recognize the Messenger? He appears to be very average. He is not sensational looking. He does not hold a great position in the world. He will disappear into the masses of people. He will walk amongst them. No one will recognize him, except perhaps for those who have been struck by the Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">For those who meet with him, he may not reveal his true purpose and work in the world with them, depending on who they are. How can it be that someone would not see this? How could it be that someone of this great importance in the world would go unrecognized by the people who are standing next to him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is the predicament of the world. Everyone has the eyes to see and the ears to hear, but they are looking in a different way, and they are trying to hear what is in their mind, what confirms what is in their mind and not what exists in reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">So they look, but they do not see. They listen, but they do not hear. They stand next to the Messenger, but they do not recognize that they are standing next to the most important person in the entire world at this time!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">He will never say this about himself. He is far too humble for this, so it must be said for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is like centuries ago. You were having tea at a table with Mohammad, but you did not know who he was. Well, he looks like anyone else. He is not radiating the Presence. He is not so magnificent or so omnipotent that everyone around him is swooned by his presence. He is just a man, dressed traditionally, just a man. There he is. I see him now. He is over here. Nothing special. He had to preach hard to even get people to listen to him. So blind was everyone around him, only a few could see. Such is the dilemma and the burden of the Messenger at any time of Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Initiation begins with impact. It begins with dissatisfaction and the recognition that you are searching, that you are not content with what you have, where you are and with what you are doing because this does not represent who you are and why you came here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Those who think they are contented have not yet reached deep enough within themselves to realize they are falling far short of where they need to be and what they need to be doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The goal is not happiness but preparation, readiness, contact, reunion and ultimately contribution to the world, wherever it may be appropriate for the individual. That is why the pursuit of happiness is so deceiving because the Revelation will make you uncomfortable. It will challenge you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do you think God is going to come and comfort you when you are sent into the world to do something that you are not doing now and have no hope of doing unless something greater is given to you, unless you are called out of the crowd, unless your journey is altered by the power of Heaven? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You will just be a speck on the ocean, unknown to yourself, unknown to others. Even if you have a great position and have acquired wealth and stature in society, the empty nature of your life will be pervasive unless you have found your greater work and are doing it to the best of your ability.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Those who do this experience a satisfaction and a sense of value and power that is lost to everyone else, no matter what they proclaim for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">God’s New Revelation will clarify the nature of human spirituality, which has been overlaid by culture, by convention and by political manipulation</span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">.</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"> It will make it clear that you are born with two minds—a worldly mind that is conditioned by the world and a deeper mind within you that is still connected to God. It will make it clear that the intellect has limits, and beyond these limits, you must go beneath the surface of the mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It will make it clear that you cannot fulfill yourself apart from your greater work and destiny and that all the pleasures you seek will be temporary and will not satisfy the deeper need of your soul. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It will make it clear that you are living at a time of great change, where humanity’s isolation in the universe will come to an end and where the Great Waves of change will strike the world—a time of great upheaval and uncertainty, a time for the Revelation to occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">People may want many things from the Messenger—hoping for dispensations, for miracles, hoping to believe in someone supernatural, hoping to have their life be enriched by his presence and his work. They will be disappointed as have the previous Messengers disappointed many people. That is why Messengers are denied, rejected, avoided and, in some cases, destroyed because the people do not get what they want. They only receive what they truly need. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">What people want and the Will of Heaven are so very different. But if in truth you could discern your deeper requirements for life beyond survival and acquiring the simple things that are necessary for stability and safety in the world, you would see that what you want and the Will of Heaven are really the same. But this recognition would happen only at a very deep state of self-honesty for the individual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is unlikely you have found this quite yet, but you who are hearing our words have come to the point where Initiation can occur. You must listen with your heart, not with your judgment and your ideas and all of the requirements you think are required for the Revelation to be real and to be meaningful to you, as if you could determine such things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even in people’s misery, they still do not have the humility to recognize that they cannot establish the terms of engagement regarding their primary relationship with the Creator and with the Will of Heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Your religious beliefs cannot really do this because it happens beyond the realm of belief. Belief will not get you into your Ancient Home, your Heavenly state, because belief is too weak, too temporary. When you leave this world, you will not have any beliefs. They all pass with the body. You will just be there, you as you really are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Your Spiritual Family will receive you and ask you if you achieved certain things, and in that moment, without the burden and the blinding effect of your beliefs, it will be clear as day that you either did or did not fulfill these primary functions. And there is no condemnation if you should decline. It just means your work is not yet done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You have to work your way back into Heaven, you see. You have to serve the separated world, the separated universe. You have to work your way back, through contribution and through self-development. You cannot return to your Ancient Home as a miserable, conflicted, contentious, grievous person. Heaven would seem like Hell to you, if that were the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">God does not simply dispense with all these problems because God did not create them. They have to be </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>un</em></span><span style="font-size: medium;">created. God has given you the power of Knowledge, the deeper intelligence, and a greater calling to erase the tragedy of your former life and existence, to restore to you the dignity and the purpose that is yours to claim and the purpose that is yours to serve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">It all begins with the Initiation. If it is to be true and efficacious, it begins with the Initiation. That is where God sets the terms of engagement and establishes the beginning of your real journey Home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">You cannot take yourself back to your true state because you do not know the way. You cannot simply follow a prescription from someone else because the engagement with Knowledge and the Presence must occur somewhere along the line, or this is an intellectual enterprise and not a journey of the soul.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Time is short for the world. There is no time to spend decades and centuries perfecting yourself or trying to work out your dilemmas. The calling is for now. The hour is late.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">This will be pressure for you if you can respond, but the pressure will shorten the time it takes for you to respond and to prepare. And that is a great blessing, for time equals suffering for those who cannot respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The gift is within you, but you cannot unlock the door. You do not have the key. You cannot discover your deeper nature because you do not yet have the whole picture. You are not yet in relationship with your Source because your deeper nature </span><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>is </em></span><span style="font-size: medium;">the relationship with your Source. How could it be you would ever find it living in Separation, lost in the oceans of the world? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is the gift of Heaven—that your life can be redeemed, but you must allow the pathway to be presented to you. You must respond to the Revelation. If you have not responded to God’s previous Revelations, then you are waiting for the New Revelation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">At some point, at a moment of despair or disillusionment, you will feel a deeper stirring within you. And you will recognize that you have come for a greater purpose that you have not yet discovered but which awaits you, waiting for the moment where your life is being called.</span></p>

As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 5, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>God has sent a New Message into the world. For humanity is entering a new era, a difficult era, an era of great environmental change and political and economic instability. Humanity is facing competition from races in the universe who are in the world to take advantage of human conflict for their own purposes.</p>
<p>It is a threshold that will determine the fate and the future of human civilization. The challenge will be immense, but so will the calling for people to cooperate for human ingenuity, creativity and unity. </p>
<p>It is an unprecedented time. It is a time of Revelation.</p>
<p>God’s former Revelations cannot prepare humanity for what it will be facing now. So God has spoken again for the human family, sending a New Revelation into the world. This is the Revelation.</p>
<p>A Messenger has been sent here to receive the New Revelation, to carry it forth into the world and to build its essential community so that its purity and its efficacy can be assured.</p>
<p>The Revelation is greater than anything that has ever been given to humanity before. It includes its own commentary. It not only gives you the greater truth. It tells you what it means and how it can be expressed and applied.</p>
<p>The Revelation is not going to be left up to individuals, however well meaning, to determine its meaning and its value here on Earth. This has led, of course, to both wisdom and error in the past. </p>
<p>The Revelation now is too critically important to be left up to human comprehension and invention. </p>
<p>That is why the Messenger is here. That is why the New Message contains its own commentary and teachings—a thousand teachings for a changing world.</p>
<p>The Messenger is carrying a great burden. He has spent decades receiving something of immense magnitude, a new threshold of awareness and understanding for the human family. </p>
<p>He has brought wisdom and Knowledge from the universe here so that humanity may become prepared for its encounter with life beyond its borders. </p>
<p>He has brought a New Revelation about God and Creation. He has brought a new comprehension of human relationships and the nature and purpose of human spirituality.</p>
<p>He is bringing forth a Revelation that is unspoiled by the world, that has been unchanged by the world. He is allowing people to hear the Voice that has spoken to him so that the Message itself may be very clear.</p>
<p>It is a Revelation unlike anything that has been given to humanity before. It is not merely an ongoing commentary on human spirituality. It is not merely a refinement of what has been given before. It is not a reaction to religions or religious institutions. </p>
<p>It is a new threshold for humanity. For you are emerging into a Greater Community of life now, and you must learn of this Greater Community, which will redefine your understanding of Divinity, purpose and meaning in life.</p>
<p>Humanity is entering a more difficult world, a new world of environmental instability with the great risk of human conflict and war.</p>
<p>You are functioning now on a planetary scale, involving everyone. It is not merely a problem for one nation, or one tribe or one group.</p>
<p>We speak with the authority of the Creator, and the Messenger must speak with the authority of the Creator.</p>
<p>He will be misjudged. He will be maligned. He will be denied. For this always happens at the time of Revelation.</p>
<p>Yet he is a humble man. He is without ambition or deception. In a sense, he is too good for the world, but his goodness is necessary to represent the Revelation. </p>
<p>It is a great burden for him, and to communicate something of this magnitude requires skill, clarity and determination on his part and on the part of the many people who will bear witness to him at the beginning of his greater ministry.</p>
<p>The Revelation does not meet people’s expectations. It is not a fulfillment of the past. It is not bound to human understanding, human conventions or even human theological understanding.</p>
<p>All this the Messenger must communicate. He will be asked foolish questions. He will be asked malicious questions. Doubt and blame and terrible associations will be cast upon him by the foolish and the ignorant. </p>
<p>People will feel threatened by his declarations, not because the declarations are incorrect, but because they are unwilling or unable to re-examine their own ideas. They cannot respond to the New Revelation. They cannot accept that God has spoken again. They have too much fear and too much investment in the past to be able to reconsider their beliefs, their ideas and their associations.</p>
<p>Yet there are many minds in the world who are open. There are many people who are looking for the New Revelation. It would be of the greatest advantage if they could know of the Messenger in his lifetime. He is an older man now. He does not have many years. And so it is a great blessing to meet him, to know of him and to hear him speak, even if you cannot be with him in person.</p>
<p>For the first time, the Revelation is being recorded accurately and completely at the time of the Messenger. This is not something that will be formulated after the Messenger is gone and cast into a religious understanding by people who really do not have the religious understanding.</p>
<p>That is why the Revelation has taken so very long. It is being delivered with great care. It is providing its own commentary to limit the great risk of misunderstanding and misapplication.</p>
<p>The Messenger has been given wisdom and Knowledge from the universe that humanity will need to face its difficulties here on Earth and to meet the immense challenge of dealing with a non-human universe, a competitive universe, a universe that humanity knows nothing about.</p>
<p>The Messenger must speak of the reality and the spirituality of this Greater Community of life at least in general terms so that people can understand what they are dealing with—the advantages that humanity has and its disadvantages as well.</p>
<p>The Messenger will speak of things for the present and for the future. He will provide answers for questions that have not even arisen. He will speak to the needs of people in the future as well as people today, for the Revelation is not only for this time, but for the times to come.</p>
<p>The Messenger has a devoted wife and son and a small group of individuals who are committed and dedicated to helping him bring God’s New Revelation into the world. </p>
<p>Those who are called to be the first respondents in many nations and from many cultures, they will have to bear witness to the Messenger because they are living in the time of Revelation and the time of the Messenger.</p>
<p>Many people will want many things from the Messenger. They will want him to create miracles and be a healer and to have answers for all the political and social problems in the world today. They will want him to be pure and immaculate perhaps. They will want him to be present to their needs. They will think he should be many different things. </p>
<p>This always confronts a Messenger bringing a Revelation not only for the times in which it is introduced, but for the future as well.</p>
<p>The Messenger will have to disappoint many of these expectations, for he cannot be all things to all people. He cannot fit the moral expectations that many people will have. For they do not understand the Messenger. They do not understand the means of Revelation.</p>
<p>Many people will resist the Messenger because they do not want to face the fact that such an individual is in their presence and what this might mean for them and what kind of responsibility this might provoke. They will say, “Oh, there are many messengers and many prophets and many teachings. It cannot be just one person.” People can be indignant over this issue.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there are many people who believe that a new prophet cannot come into the world, that God has said everything God is ever going to say to humanity centuries ago. God has nothing more to say to humanity. God does not care anymore. God gave the prescriptions centuries ago and that is sufficient forever and ever.</p>
<p>But no one can say, even God’s Messengers cannot say, what God will do next. No one can honestly state that a New Revelation cannot be given to the world, for this is a position of ignorance and arrogance. Even God’s past Messengers cannot make these claims.</p>
<p>So people will have to face the reality and the meaning of the New Revelation. They will have to face their response to the Messenger. They will have to face the consequences of either succeeding or failing in this encounter. It will be a great test, a test of integrity, honesty, clarity and wisdom.</p>
<p>If you are really honest with yourself, then you will realize that you cannot say what God will do and not do. You cannot claim your religion is the only religion or the great religion or the last religion or the final religion, for this is to claim that you know God’s Plan and Purpose now and into the future, and no one on Earth, no one in the physical universe, can make such a claim.</p>
<p>Here you begin to see the burden of the Messenger. He will point to the Revelation—its empowerment for the individual, its direction for the leaders of nations, its message of purpose, unity and urgency. He will speak of great problems that people do not want to face. His words will fly in the face of human denial and presumption.</p>
<p>Yet the Messenger is not here to condemn nations and governments and institutions, but to provide a clarification of the meaning and purpose of human spirituality and what must be done to prepare for the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world and for humanity’s future and destiny within a Greater Community of life in the universe.</p>
<p>The things that he will say can only be said by the Messenger, for no one on Earth could know the things that he is saying. No one on Earth has lived in the Greater Community in recent times.</p>
<p>Many people are seeing great danger in terms of the environment of the world and the future of civilization, but no one has the whole picture, you see, for only God can provide this. </p>
<p>God must communicate through one Messenger. Otherwise, the Message will become divided and conflicted and in competition, leading to great confusion and disillusionment.</p>
<p>The Messenger is providing an entirely new paradigm of understanding, a Greater Community awareness, a new realization about God, the nature of the Divine Presence, Will and influence in the world.</p>
<p>This is not a God of one people or one world. This is a God of all the universes. </p>
<p>This is not a fatherly God figure who is preoccupied with human affairs and all the particulars of each individual’s life. </p>
<p>This is a God who has set into motion the forces of evolution, geological and biological change, at the beginning of time. </p>
<p>This is a God who will not sit in judgment and cast people into the fires of Hell, for God has given each person the power of Knowledge. They may eventually respond to this, for this is the part of them that has never left God, the part of them that has never been separated. It is the plan of redemption that very few people in the world today really understand.</p>
<p>The Messenger will have to speak of these things, some of which are so far beyond conventional thinking and understanding, things that must be responded to at a deeper level—a deeper level of recognition, a deeper level of honesty. He is not merely presenting theories or perspective or ideas to be considered and debated. He is delivering the Revelation.</p>
<p>It has taken him decades to receive it, it is so great. Part of it will be confounding to people, it is so far beyond their current concerns and understanding. And yet the essence of this is intrinsic and natural to each person, for it speaks to the deeper intelligence within each person, an intelligence born of their relationship with the Divine.</p>
<p>This is beyond philosophical debate and theological argument. This is beyond national perspective or religious pride. This is beyond everything that distinguishes people from each other and sets them in contrast and in conflict with one another here in the world.</p>
<p>The Messenger will present spirituality as it has been practiced by advanced races in the universe. This is not born of his understanding but of the Revelation itself. </p>
<p>The Messenger will speak of the Intervention occurring in the world today by small groups of foreign explorers and opportunists who are here to take advantage of human weakness and human expectation.</p>
<p>The Messenger will speak of the affairs of the Greater Community, not because he has been there himself and traveled around and visited countless places, but because this is the Revelation.</p>
<p>The Messenger will speak of relationships of higher purpose. This he has experienced and demonstrated in his life, but what he will say will be part of the Revelation. What he will say will be part of the Revelation, for the Revelation speaks on many things.</p>
<p>This is the burden of the Messenger. This is within him. This has been revealed to him. </p>
<p>The process of Revelation is not understood in the world. People think the Messengers are gods, or they discount them altogether as being merely teachers, offering different perspectives.</p>
<p>People want to come to God on their terms, but God sets the terms of engagement. God establishes the terms of the approach. </p>
<p>You do not know your way to God, but God knows the way to you. You cannot determine under what circumstances you will accept or believe and receive Revelation, for this is merely being blind and arrogant. </p>
<p>You know not what the Revelation will reveal. It is not here to make you rich, lazy and happy. It is here to call you into greater service and to prepare you for a more difficult and challenging world, a world that will now involve factors and influences never seen before in the world, influences from the universe around you.</p>
<p>Everyone was sent into the world to be in the world at this time, to face these great and emerging circumstances. So to claim it is too much for you is simply to admit your weakness and to not recognize your responsibility to prepare.</p>
<p>Everyone is weak to begin with, of course. You do not become strong simply because you want to. You become strong responding to the requirements and the circumstances of life.</p>
<p>This is the meaning of the Revelation. This is the power of the Revelation. Time is clicking and marching on. Humanity does not have a great deal of time to adapt to a new world and to prepare for the Greater Community. </p>
<p>That is part of the burden of the Messenger.</p>
<p>Humanity does not have decades and centuries to consider the meaning and the value of the Revelation, For humanity’s fate and future is at a great turning point. The decisions made today will determine the outcome of so many things.</p>
<p>Human neglect, human irresponsibility, human denial—all these things will guarantee a far more difficult future for you and for your children and for the future generations.</p>
<p>Human freedom and sovereignty in this world are being challenged. You cannot assume that you will have them into the future without a great preparation and determined action.</p>
<p>Freedom is rare in the universe. Nations that are free must prepare themselves and must exercise great discretion and discernment. These are all things for humanity to learn, to appreciate and to prioritize. </p>
<p>This is the burden of the Messenger.</p>
<p>He will be limited by the limitations of people’s response. He will be held back by the ignorance of others. He will have to contend with projections of blame and condemnation.</p>
<p>He will have to thread his course very carefully, with great care. Everything he says can be remembered. Everything he does is a demonstration. </p>
<p>Those who are sent to be close to him must become developed, educated and strong, strong with the power of Knowledge, or they could betray him to those forces who will seek to undermine and to thwart his presence in the world.</p>
<p>Great responsibility attends all who will be close to the Messenger and all who will receive the Revelation. For you receive this not only for yourself but also to allow the Revelation to move through you to others. </p>
<p>It must be shared person to person. This gives it its greatest efficacy. But for this to maintain the clarity and integrity of the New Message, the purity of the Message must be given and recorded. Otherwise, its meaning and value will be lost in translation.</p>
<p>This is part of the burden of the Messenger. </p>
<p>Think of these things. Consider these things. And consider your responsibilities in responding to the Revelation and in considering the fact that you are living at the time of the Messenger.</p>
<p>Think of these things seriously now. It is of great importance to your life and to the future and well-being of the human family.</p>

<p id="date">As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on July 6, 2006<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>There is a New Message from God in the World.</p>
<p>It has come from the Creator of all life.</p>
<p>It has been translated into human language and understanding through the Angelic Presence that oversees this world.</p>
<p>It continues the great series of transmissions from the Creator that have occurred over centuries and millennia.</p>
<p>It is a New Message for this time and the times to come.</p>
<p>It fulfills the former great Messages that have been given to humanity, and yet it reveals things that have never been shown to humanity before, for humanity is now facing a grave and perilous set of challenges, both within the world and from beyond the world.</p>
<p>The New Message from God is here to alert, to empower and to prepare the human family—people from all nations and religious traditions, people from all tribes, groups and orientations.</p>
<p>It has come at a time of great need, a time of great consequence.</p>
<p>It is preparing people for things that have not even been recognized.</p>
<p>It is prophetic in alerting people both to the Great Waves of Change that are coming to the world and to humanity’s position in the Universe, especially regarding its contact with other races.</p>
<p>The New Message calls upon the spiritual presence within each person—the great endowment of Knowledge that has been given to the entire human family which must now be cultivated, strengthened and brought forth.</p>
<p>It speaks of the great spiritual need of the individual—the need for purpose, meaning and direction.</p>
<p>It speaks to the great relationships that people can establish with one another, relationships representing their higher purpose in life.</p>
<p>It speaks to the needs of the world and the needs of the future. In so doing, it brings purpose and recognition, unity and cooperation, wisdom and strength to all who can receive it, learn it, follow its steps, contribute it to others and share its wisdom in service to other individuals, to families, to communities, to nations and to the whole world.</p>
<p>Receive this blessing.</p>
<p>Learn of the New Message from God.</p>
<p>Realize it will affirm all that is true within your current traditions and it will speak to the deeper wisdom that you already possess.</p>
<p>It will speak to your heart, even beyond your thoughts and beliefs and the thoughts and beliefs of your culture and your nation.</p>
<p>Receive this gift and learn of it patiently, taking the steps to Knowledge, learning wisdom from the Greater Community and recognizing the power of the One Spirituality of humanity to unite, strengthen and prepare humanity to recognize and to navigate the difficult times ahead.</p>
<p>Receive the New Message in its calling for the preservation and the strengthening of human freedom, cooperation and responsibility, for without this New Message, humanity is facing a grave and precipitous decline.</p>
<p>Humanity is facing the loss of its freedom and sovereignty in this world to intervening forces from the Universe.</p>
<p>Without this New Message, the human spirit will remain dormant, and people will live lives of desperation, competition and conflict.</p>
<p>It is the Creator’s will that humanity emerge into the Greater Community of intelligent life in the Universe as a free and sovereign race—as a strong race, as a united race, as a race that is capable of maintaining its cultural diversity while honoring the deeper strength and purpose that will keep the human family strong, that will keep the human family vital, active and creative.</p>
<p>The New Message from God presents a new opportunity for advancement in the future, but to advance you must survive. You must survive the difficult times ahead, and you must survive competition from beyond the world regarding who will control this world and its destiny.</p>
<p>Each individual must recognize that they have a great opportunity to discover the deeper Knowledge that God has given them—the Knowledge which contains their purpose, meaning and direction and the criteria for all their meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>There is a New Message from God for the individual, and there is a New Message from God for the entire world.</p>
<p>It is here now.</p>
<p>It has taken a long time for the Messenger to receive it, for the Message is very great.</p>
<p>Honor then the one who has come to bring the New Message into the world.</p>
<p>He is a humble man.</p>
<p>He has developed the wisdom necessary to undertake such a great role, and he has been sent into the world for this purpose.</p>
<p>Receive him.</p>
<p>Understand him.</p>
<p>Yet do not exalt him.</p>
<p>He is not a god. He is a Messenger bringing the New Message from God into the world.</p>
<p>This is the time now.</p>
<p>This is the great opportunity.</p>
<p>This is the answer to people’s prayers all around the world—prayers through every religion, through every nation and culture, prayers for wisdom, strength, unity, freedom and deliverance.</p>
<p>Receive this New Message now.</p>
<p>It is come, and it is come at just the right time.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 17, 2007<br />
in Istanbul, Turkey</p>
<p>This is part of the New Message for the World regarding the fate of nations and peoples and the great calling that is now sounding for humanity.</p>
<p>The peoples and the nations of the world are entering a time of grave difficulty and change. The world’s resources are declining. Populations are growing. And as this occurs, there will be continued competition and the grave danger of conflict and war.</p>
<p>Here ancient animosities will be aroused. Prejudices will be played upon and used by those who are ambitious within both governments and religious institutions. Human weakness will be preyed upon, and fear will be pervasive.</p>
<p>It is because of this great threshold that a New Message from God has been sent into the world for the protection and advancement of humanity. In order to understand the greatness of this Message and its relevance to your time, you must come to understand and recognize those great changes that are now threatening the human family—threatening to send it into decline, threatening to ruin the great accomplishments of civilization, threatening to undermine the well-being and survival of people everywhere.</p>
<p>Here politics and even religion itself will be used as weapons of war, as a leverage to separate people and to pit them against one another in a great conflict, not over ideology, but over the resources of the world.</p>
<p>Here the conflict will be masked. It will be clothed in the disguise of politics and religion, but in essence it is a competition for resources. It is a conflict over access and distribution of resources.</p>
<p>Humanity now faces great danger as it begins to encounter a world in decline—a world whose environments have been degraded, a world whose climate has been affected, a world whose life-sustaining resources are being depleted and ruined by human ignorance and human greed. It is for this reason that a New Message from God has been sent into the world.</p>
<p>To recognize the New Message and to understand its Source and its meaning for this time, this time of Revelation, you must come to recognize the predicament that humanity is now entering and that it is already facing in so many places. You will not be able to appreciate the New Message from God unless you can face these realities, unless you can recognize these conditions and unless you can see that without a greater Message from the Source of all life, humanity’s possibility to navigate these difficult times is very small. The possibility for humanity to avoid ongoing war, conflict and degradation is very small. The promise for humanity to begin a greater future, a future that will be unlike the past, will be very small.</p>
<p>The odds against humanity’s success now are so significant that there must be a New Message from God. You must see the New Message within this context or you will not understand the time of Revelation in which you live. You will not understand.</p>
<p>To those who will be tempted to take up the sword in the name of religion or political advantage: You must recognize that your thoughts, your intent and your actions go against God’s will for humanity. They are in violation of what God intends for humanity. For God intends for humanity to become united and self-sufficient within a universe full of intelligent life. Even at this moment, there are other powers beyond this world who are awaiting humanity’s failure, awaiting the opportunity to intervene in order to take advantage of a weak and conflicted humanity.</p>
<p>If you cannot see this or cannot accept this, then you do not understand humanity’s great predicament at this time. You do not understand the travail that is now upon the human family. And you will not see the great danger, the Greater Darkness that now lurks in the world, a darkness that is born of intervention from beyond and a darkness that is born of human ignorance, greed, competition, conflict and war.</p>
<p>To you who would take up the sword in the name of religion or political advantage: You must realize that you are violating God’s will for humanity. And though the Creator will not punish you, you will within yourself step away from the Knowledge of God within yourself. You will cast yourself into darkness and confusion. And you will lead your peoples and your nation into conflict, desolation and ruin. For you are beyond the time in which one nation can simply profit from the decline of another, for the whole world is now at stake.</p>
<p>If you would take up the sword in the name of religion or political advantage, you will violate God’s Plan for humanity. Though God will not punish you directly, you will separate yourself and turn away from the Knowledge of God that is within you, that God has placed within you for your own protection and redemption. And you will cast yourself into chaos and conflict, into rage and misery, and bring ruin and desolation to your people.</p>
<p>This is a great risk, and this will be the great temptation of humanity—for people to exercise their grievances against one another, to exercise their ancient animosities, for nations to begin to compete and enter into conflict with other nations, believing it is for the well-being of their nation or for the will of God.</p>
<p>But you are deceived. You are in error. You are violating God’s Will and Plan for humanity. Though God will not punish you directly, you will separate yourself from God’s Wisdom and God’s Will. You will enter into confusion and darkness, into grievance and ultimately into despair.</p>
<p>Take heed, then, the nations of the world, the leaders of the world and the citizens of the world. Heed these words, for they come from the Divine will and presence. They represent the Knowledge that has been placed within you to guide and to protect you. This is the same Knowledge that is here to guide and protect all of humanity.</p>
<p>This is why the Messenger has been sent into the world—to bring this New Message of hope, this Message of restitution and resolution, to the human family at this time of great travail.</p>
<p>For you are entering a time of great travail. You are just beginning the time in which the great wars and the great conflicts can emerge. The embers for these wars are already glowing. The intent for these wars is already alive in the minds and hearts of many people. And the conditions for these conflicts and wars are upon you.<br />
Here humanity has its one great chance to unite in its own defense and for its own preservation—both within the world and in the face of a Greater Community of life in the universe, where freedom is unknown and humanity’s value is not recognized, save by but a few.</p>
<p>Those who would take up the sword in the name of God or for political advantage will have failed their mission and calling in life, and they will lead others to failure as well. Within this failure, there will be no peace and no resolution, for they will have denied the Knowledge of God within themselves. They will have denied the Plan of the Creator for humanity. They will have turned themselves against the greater wisdom that God has placed within them and within all hearts. They will have, through ignorance and arrogance and vanity, destroyed their great opportunity to make a real contribution to their people, to their nation and to the world.</p>
<p>Take heed, then, of this warning. It carries with it the gravest of consequences and the greatest meaning. The complete meaning of this warning is beyond your comprehension, and yet what it has to say to you will be clear, simple and easy for you to understand.</p>
<p>Beware, the leaders of nations and the leaders of religion. Beware if you seek to hurt or conquer another nation for your own advantage or to express your grievance or your ancient animosities. Be aware that you are casting yourself into the darkness and into confusion and misery, and you will bring desolation, destitution and ruin upon your peoples as a result.</p>
<p>And be aware, the average citizen, that you too have a responsibility to follow the wisdom and Knowledge that God has placed within you, to discover this wisdom and Knowledge and not to violate it because of anger or revenge, rage or greed. You too have a responsibility, for the outcome is not simply up to the leaders of the nations and the religions. It is ultimately up to every person.</p>
<p>Take heed then of this great warning. This warning is born of the love of God, but it is a warning nonetheless. It is warning you against the great possibility for error. It is advising you to turn to the Knowledge of God that lives within you—beyond your thinking mind and beyond the ideas, concepts and beliefs that have been historically established within humanity.</p>
<p>For there is a moral and ethical foundation to your existence. Should you violate this, you will suffer the consequences, not because God is punishing you, but because you are punishing yourself, because you have turned away from what God has placed within you and because, out of arrogance, ignorance and vanity, you have given yourself authority to override what God has placed within you.</p>
<p>Be aware of the great danger for you individually, for your people, your nation and the world, for the great time of trial and tribulation is upon you. How humanity will respond, both its leaders and its citizens, will make all the difference in the outcome. The power of decision here is with you. God’s Will is clear—God is preparing humanity for its encounter with life in the Universe. This is clear and is presented in the New Message.</p>
<p>Yet in order for you to reap the great rewards of the New Message, in order for you to prepare yourself for a future that will be unlike the past, in order for you to avoid calamity and disaster, you must take heed. You must stop. You must restrain your anger and your passions. You must withhold your judgments of others. You must consider the wisdom of your thoughts and actions and their consequences for the future.</p>
<p>Be prepared, for great and difficult times are upon you. They are a product of human ignorance and human abuse of the world. They are the product of humanity’s lack of vision and its lack of preparation for the future.</p>
<p>It will be the responsibility of all nations and leaders to provide for their people adequately in the times to come, but this will become ever more difficult and challenging. The rich will have to take care of the poor. And the poor will have to take care of one another. There will have to be greater service to humanity and greater selflessness under these difficult conditions.</p>
<p>For humanity has pillaged the Earth to such an extent that it can barely sustain the human family. The conditions and the circumstances of your life, whether you be rich or poor, no matter what nation you live in, will now press these needs upon you.</p>
<p>Be aware that this great difficulty has called the New Message from God into the world and God’s Messenger has been sent into the world to give this Message, to elucidate it and to be its primary focus and vehicle of expression.<br />
Do not judge and condemn the Messenger lest you judge and condemn what God has placed within you. For though the Messenger is human and fallible, he brings with him a Message that is beyond human invention and that is without error, conflict and contradiction.</p>
<p>Receive this Message from God. Consider it in light of the world you see and the world you know. Think of the history of humanity and its great battles, its great conquests, and how utterly destructive this has been—that so many people should sacrifice in order that a few may enrich themselves.</p>
<p>Consider now that this cannot proceed into the future lest the entire human family enter a state of permanent decline, lest you make yourself vulnerable to intervention and invasion from forces from beyond the world, who even now are planning to take advantage of humanity’s conflicts and dissolution.</p>
<p>To know yourself is to know God’s Presence in your life, to know that God has placed a deeper Knowledge within you to guide and to protect you and to override your self-destructive tendencies and your selfish pursuits. To know yourself is to know what God has placed within you—not to understand it intellectually, but to know of its reality, to experience its presence and to follow its direction.</p>
<p>As uncertainty, anxiety and competition increase in the world, you will need this guidance now more than ever before. For the institutions and the comforts that you have perhaps benefited from may not be there for you in the future. The assurances and the security that were provided for you, to whatever extent they were, may not be there for you in the future.</p>
<p>How will you know how to be secure? How will you know what to do in the face of uncertainty and change? God’s answer is within you. To remind you of this, God has brought a New Message into the world and has sent its Messenger into the world.</p>
<p>You do not know enough yet to question this or to dispute it, for do so is merely an expression of your ignorance, arrogance and vanity. You must consider the New Message. You must hear the Messenger to know, to see and to understand. For on your own, without the great endowment of Knowledge, you will not be able to see, to know and to understand. Your behavior will be determined by others. And you will follow fear and not wisdom in your approach.</p>
<p>Given the great danger and the great risks ahead, perhaps you can begin to see the light that has been brought into the world in the face of a Greater Darkness that is growing over the horizon.</p>
<p>Receive this warning then as a gift of love. Receive it as a consolation and a confirmation that what you most deeply feel is true, that humanity is facing great peril now—conflict from within and intervention from without. Have the courage to face this. Have the honesty to recognize it. Have the sobriety to consider it without trying to make it what you want it to be or what you think it is.</p>
<p>This is your responsibility. This is the calling of your time. It is a time of Revelation, and the Revelation is upon you.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 14, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado<em></em><br />
<a href="http://wp.newmessage.org/the-voice-of-revelation-by-patricia-summers/">Read the account of Patricia Summers</a></p>
<p>Today we will speak of The Voice of the Revelation.</p>
<p>The Voice you are hearing is not of one individual, but of the Angelic Host together, speaking together, with one Voice.</p>
<p>It is passing through one individual, yes, but at a higher level, individuality is entirely different. So very unlike it is in your world.</p>
<p>That is why Our Voice is so unique because this is the Voice of many.<br />
That is why We speak the way we do because it is the Voice of many.</p>
<p>People in the world can only think of individuals. They ask, “Well, what is the name of this Angel, or this Being?”</p>
<p>But names are not important in matters such as this, except to those who cannot think beyond the boundaries of their own separation.</p>
<p>In a way, Our Voice is part of the New Message for your awareness so that you may understand the process of Revelation and bear witness to this.</p>
<p>Never before has this process been really revealed, not to the common person, not to the general public, not even to scholars and experts, theologians and philosophers.</p>
<p>It is time now for humanity to learn of these things because it is living at a time of Revelation.</p>
<p>We are the Revelation.</p>
<p>God does not speak because God is too great.</p>
<p>Therefore, God’s Will is expressed and communicated to the Angelic Presence, who oversee all worlds where intelligent life has evolved.</p>
<p>The Will of the Creator is then expressed in the words and language of that world, for that people.</p>
<p>There is one thing God cannot be, and that is not God, which is a very peculiar thing regarding your existence, for Creation cannot not really be Creation, and you are part of Creation.</p>
<p>And that is the conundrum and contradiction of your existence.</p>
<p>You are pretending to be what you are not. But that pretense is what it means to be in the world.</p>
<p>Many of Us have been in worlds such as this. We understand these things.</p>
<p>That is why we are the perfect intermediary to express the Will and intentions of the Creator, and to bring this Will and intention to you, not only in terms of ultimate teachings, but in terms of commentary and application—explaining what these things mean, how they can be experienced and applied in your life and particularly in the changing circumstances of the world.</p>
<p>For the world is facing the Great Waves of change, and the world is experiencing intervention from races from beyond.</p>
<p>It is a great turning point for the human family. But humanity is unaware and unprepared and is very vulnerable to deception and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>For the Messenger to come into the world at this time, the process of Revelation itself must be revealed, or his presence and purpose here will not be understood, and he will be confused with others who make great claims but who, themselves, have not the great Message to deliver.</p>
<p>People will be confused as to who to listen to.</p>
<p>They will be confused by the Voice of the Revelation. For there are many voices speaking to humanity at this time—voices from the Greater Community, voices from the Intervention, voices in your own mind, voices that haunt you, voices that delight you.</p>
<p>But there is only one Voice of the Revelation, and We are that one Voice.</p>
<p>For you to accept this means that you must accept that you are receiving the Revelation and begin to consider the responsibilities that that might place upon you.</p>
<p>You are being shown how God speaks to the world and that God has spoken again to prepare humanity for a future unlike the past, for a new set of realities, for a new existence and a greater challenge and difficulty.</p>
<p>The evolution of humanity follows the pattern of evolution of most of the races in the universe. When those races begin to exhaust their own planets and face the reality of the Greater Community of life in the universe, they have reached a great and difficult and precipitous threshold.</p>
<p>They have reached a true turning point where their past understanding and assumptions will not serve them and might even betray them.</p>
<p>Humanity has reached this threshold.</p>
<p>For you to grow up spiritually as well as physically in this world and prepare yourself for a Greater Community, you will need a New Revelation from God, for you cannot prepare yourself for what you know nothing about.</p>
<p>People are still too grounded in the past, identified with the past, their assumptions based upon the past, so that they cannot really see what is coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>Then of course there is the problem of human denial, the weakness of the mind in facing reality and in preparing for eventualities.</p>
<p>These are all problems inherent in the human family, and really every other race in the universe has to deal with these kinds of problems as well.</p>
<p>So you are not alone, and you are following the path of evolution, preparing yourself to come out of isolation in the universe.</p>
<p>Such a threshold requires a greater spiritual understanding, a greater recognition of the Divine Presence in the universe.</p>
<p>You are no longer dealing with a local god, a local deity, a god of the hill and the tree, a god of the ocean and the river.</p>
<p>You are not even dealing with the god of one world and one people, as you are accustomed to think.</p>
<p>Now you are dealing with a God of all the universes and Creation beyond the universes, a God so great that your mind can only fall down in praise.</p>
<p>Not a human God. Not a God that you create in your own imagination, but a God that you must experience at a deeper level, beneath and beyond the limits of your surface mind.</p>
<p>For you to comprehend the God of the Greater Community, then you must comprehend the Voice of the Revelation.</p>
<p>A misunderstanding here could be very damaging and dangerous.</p>
<p>For you will hear various voices, but you will not know what to listen to.</p>
<p>Without the deeper Knowledge within you that God has placed there to guide you, how can you tell the difference?</p>
<p>And if you cannot respond to the Revelation from God, how will you respond to the truth in anything?</p>
<p>So bound by belief and presumption, how can you hear the truth in anything?</p>
<p>It is a great test and a great testimony, a great challenge for the listener.</p>
<p>But it is not only a challenge. It is a call to awaken and to prepare.</p>
<p>For you are facing a hazardous future, a dangerous future—a dangerous and difficult passage into the Greater Community, a dangerous and difficult passage into a new world, a world of diminishing resources and growing political and economic upheaval.</p>
<p>It is not a time for ancient theories. It is not a time for even ancient religions to speak of these things, without the blessing and the guidance of the Creator.</p>
<p>God has spoken again, and no one in the world can claim that God cannot speak again, and if they do so, it is their ignorance and their arrogance that makes them speak of this.</p>
<p>Even God’s Messengers cannot determine what God will do next.</p>
<p>Even the Angelic Host cannot determine what God will do next.</p>
<p>In time, this is the case. Beyond time, it is a different matter altogether, and these problems are not a concern.</p>
<p>We are the bridge between the reality of time and space and the reality beyond time and space—two realities that are so very different.</p>
<p>You cannot imagine this Greater Reality because your imagination can only deal with images and thoughts of this world.</p>
<p>That is why humanity’s conception of Paradise, or Heaven, is completely arranged by worldly images and worldly concerns.</p>
<p>But the reality is completely different and beyond all of this.</p>
<p>This is not your concern, however, for you were not sent into the world to dream of Heaven.</p>
<p>You were sent into the world to be of service to the world, to be of service of now a new world, a changing world, a challenging world, and yet a world that has the power to prompt greater human cooperation and to call forth a greater Knowledge that every person carries within them.</p>
<p>The New Revelation must call this Knowledge forth.</p>
<p>It is not a time to believe in a great leader, an emancipator, a savior.</p>
<p>Humanity is going to have to save itself now.</p>
<p>One individual would only polarize the population, setting greater human conflict, setting the stage for a war against the believers and the non-believers.</p>
<p>No, the calling must be for the individual now, for the world will need many saviors, many guided and inspired individuals, or human civilization could fail, and that failure could be the most terrible thing that could happen to the human family.</p>
<p>You would surely fall under the domination of foreign powers in the universe.</p>
<p>Such powers are watching you, listening to you, planning to carry out their activities through devious and subtle means.</p>
<p>It is a dangerous time, but for you, it is the right time to be in the world, for this is why you have come—not to hide out in fantasy, not to enrich yourself, not to pretend to be something you are not, not to live a life of avoidance and irresponsibility, but to be in the world to be of service to the world at this time, not only to meet the current needs of life, but to prepare for the future itself.</p>
<p>Only Knowledge within you, the greater intelligence, knows of these things, and it must guide you in these matters. You must learn to yield to it and distinguish it from all the other voices in your mind and all the influences that pull upon you from the world around you.</p>
<p>For this, to learn of the Voice of the Revelation would be very important.</p>
<p>And that is why it is being shared with you.</p>
<p>That is why it is being taught for the first time in your emerging world.</p>
<p>Despite humanity’s long existence in this world, you are a young race—immature, unwary and unsuspecting.</p>
<p>You have many great qualities.</p>
<p>You have kept spirituality and creativity alive in the world, where they have died in so many other worlds—advanced technological worlds that are sterile and secular, where individual freedom is unknown.</p>
<p>You have great promise. But you have great problems, and you have some disabilities as well—the tendency towards human denial. And your tribalism, which has served you in the past, can blind you now.</p>
<p>The New Revelation is calling upon you to respond to Knowledge within yourself and to listen to the Voice of Revelation.</p>
<p>You will have many questions, of course.</p>
<p>You may have fears and suspicions.</p>
<p>You may have grave doubts.</p>
<p>That is all to be expected.</p>
<p>But the challenge for you is, can you respond to the New Revelation?</p>
<p>Can you hear the Voice of Revelation?</p>
<p>Can you have the humility and the responsibility to see that you are living at a time of Revelation and what this might mean for you?</p>
<p>What is your responsibility in this matter?</p>
<p>What does this calling mean for you?</p>
<p>Do not concern yourself with other people if the calling is for you.</p>
<p>This is between you and God, between you and Us.</p>
<p>We are the only Angelic Presence overseeing the world.</p>
<p>Choose other voices and you will choose voices from the Greater Community, who will take advantage of humanity’s religious assumptions.</p>
<p>They can project voices into the world as well.</p>
<p>How will you know the difference?</p>
<p>How can you tell what is true from what is false, what is good from what only looks good?</p>
<p>The challenge is upon the listener.</p>
<p>God is being real with you. Can you be real with God?</p>
<p>God is being honest with you. Can you be honest with God?</p>
<p>God is serving you and assisting you in ways you cannot serve yourself.</p>
<p>Can you accept this and follow the preparation that God is giving to save humanity?</p>
<p>The burden is upon the listener.</p>
<p>The proof is in the nature of your response.</p>
<p>The proof is in what it calls for in you and your resonance with the truth of the Revelation.</p>
<p>God speaks the truth through the Angelic Presence.</p>
<p>Can you hear this, feel this and respond to this?</p>
<p>Or is your mind so fixated, so bound in its beliefs, fears and suspicions that it cannot hear, it cannot respond?</p>
<p>All the great Messengers that have been sent into the world at great turning points for humanity, they have had to face this inability of others to respond.</p>
<p>They have been persecuted by this.</p>
<p>Is that who you are?</p>
<p>Will you be the persecutor of the Messenger, a denier of the Revelation?</p>
<p>If so, you will not be alone, but you will have failed the test, you see.</p>
<p>You will have disappointed the Creator.</p>
<p>The Creator will not punish you, but you will not be able to receive the blessings, the guidance and the power of the New Revelation.</p>
<p>The great empowerment will be given to others, and you will not be able to receive.</p>
<p>That would be a tremendous tragedy for your life.</p>
<p>And it would also be a tragedy for the world, for enough people must respond to the Revelation for it to have strength and be efficacious in the world, to give humanity greater encouragement, greater strength and responsibility, greater accountability to one another, greater cooperation between nations, who must now unite to preserve the world and to prepare for the Greater Community itself.</p>
<p>It is all based on the response of the individual.</p>
<p>God is not speaking to the governments of the world.</p>
<p>It is not speaking exclusively to the rich or the privileged or secret groups.</p>
<p>It is speaking to the people.</p>
<p>It is speaking to you.</p>
<p>If the people cannot respond, what can a government do?</p>
<p>And if the people do respond, the government will eventually have to change and to respond to this.</p>
<p>You are hearing the Voice of the Revelation.</p>
<p>It is the Voice of many.</p>
<p>It is the Voice of wisdom and Knowledge on a scale you cannot imagine.</p>
<p>The miracle will be in the nature of your response.</p>
<p>Can the separated be reached by the Creator of all life, or will they remain in the darkness of Separation, with only their fears and desires and assumptions to guide them?</p>
<p>Or will they respond and be ignited, enabling them to recall their greater responsibilities to be in the world, giving them the courage and the determination to follow a very different pathway in life?</p>
<p>Will they be able to receive Knowledge and wisdom from the universe, to prepare humanity for the universe?</p>
<p>Will they be able to respond to God’s Revelation?</p>
<p>This is it!</p>
<p>There will not be another.</p>
<p>There will not be another.</p>
<p>This is the Revelation for this time and the times to come.</p>
<p>God is sending only one Revelation to the world.</p>
<p>Any other revelation is either a human invention or is a manipulation from those races who are intervening in the world today.</p>
<p>You cannot come to God on your terms.</p>
<p>You cannot determine the nature and the rules of engagement.</p>
<p>You can only come to God on God’s terms, and God is establishing the terms in such a way that people will become stronger, more compassionate, more powerful, more engaged in the world and more cooperative with one another.</p>
<p>You cannot have it be your way.</p>
<p>It must be God’s way, for God knows and you do not.</p>
<p>God sees what is coming over the horizon, far, far out to sea.</p>
<p>You do not see these things.</p>
<p>God knows what human destiny is.</p>
<p>You do not know what human destiny is.</p>
<p>God knows why you are in the world and who you must meet and where you must go.</p>
<p>You cannot see this, for you can only be where you are.</p>
<p>You cannot understand the Voice of the Revelation intellectually.</p>
<p>That will not produce real recognition.</p>
<p>Recognition happens at a deeper level, beneath the surface of the mind, at the level of your heart and deeper conscience—not your social conscience, but the conscience that God has created, that enables you to respond to the truth and to gain immunity from that which is false.</p>
<p>You can only know Us and hear Us with your heart.</p>
<p>You can only know and appreciate the Messenger with your heart.</p>
<p>It may be confounding to your mind.</p>
<p>It may challenge your beliefs and assumptions.</p>
<p>It may require you to reconsider your religions, your philosophy, to whatever extent that you have these things. But the response is at a deeper level.</p>
<p>God restores and saves the separated through Knowledge.</p>
<p>If you could understand this, it would make all the difference for you.</p>
<p>If you could hear our Voices, which is one Voice, it would make all the difference for you and for your world.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 1, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>God has spoken again.</p>
<p>We are the ones to bring the Message.</p>
<p>God’s Will is presented through Us.</p>
<p>We are beyond your estimation, beyond your religious theories and your personal speculation.</p>
<p>For human imagination can only fabricate from what it experiences in the physical world. But reality exists beyond this—beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect.</p>
<p>This is the truth throughout the universe, the Greater Community of life in which you live.</p>
<p>We bring the Great Message for this era, born of the Creator of all the universes, for the protection of humanity, for the salvation of the world.</p>
<p>We are the ones whom you cannot understand. But We are the source and the medium of what humanity must recognize and do on its own behalf, what it must see, what it has not seen, what it must know, what it has not known, what it must do, which it has not done.</p>
<p>This is the Message for this era.</p>
<p>This is the time of Revelation.</p>
<p>One has been sent into the world to receive the Revelation and to bring it into human awareness, a monumental task.</p>
<p>To receive the New Message is to receive the greatest Revelation that has ever been given to the human family.</p>
<p>To present it to the world is a monumental task, a task for the Messenger and for all who will assist him in bringing the Revelation everywhere it is needed.</p>
<p>It is needed everywhere, for humanity is facing great peril.</p>
<p>It has sown the seeds of its own demise through the destruction and the degradation of its environment—its waters, its soil, its air—to the point where the world itself is beginning to change, a change that will bring great trial and tribulation to the world of people and to the human family.</p>
<p>Humanity is facing a universe of intelligent life.</p>
<p>It will have to prepare for this now, for Contact has begun—Contact by those who see the opportunity to take advantage of a weak and conflicted humanity.</p>
<p>It is a time of great change and uncertainty, where foreign powers will seek to gain influence and where humanity will fall prey to its own ignorance, foolishness and indulgences.</p>
<p>The Message is too big to say in a sentence, but it will bring you closer to God and what God has sent you, as an individual, here to do in the world now, which is far different from what you believe and imagine today.</p>
<p>God has brought wisdom from the universe to prepare humanity for the universe.</p>
<p>God has brought the essence of spirituality in a pure form—unclouded by history and human manipulation, unfettered by human politics, will and corruption.</p>
<p>We bring the Steps to Knowledge so that you may know of the deeper mind that God has placed within you to guide you in an increasingly perilous world.</p>
<p>Great upheaval will now occur and is beginning to occur—natural disasters born of humanity’s ignorance, overuse and misuse of the world.</p>
<p>It is a time of reckoning, a time of responsibility, a time to end foolishness and arrogance.</p>
<p>Only God knows what is coming.</p>
<p>We have brought the Message—a Message of a thousand messages, a Message of a thousand teachings, a Message great enough to occupy you for the rest of your time, a Message great enough to redirect human effort, energy and awareness so that humanity may have a greater future than its past, so that humanity may survive the Great Waves of change and intervention and competition from the universe around you.</p>
<p>Hear this then, not with your ideas, your beliefs or your judgments, but with the deeper mind that God has given you to hear, to see, to know and to act with greater certainty.</p>
<p>Our words are not for speculation or debate. That is the indulgence of the foolish, who cannot hear and cannot see.</p>
<p>You are terrified of the Revelation, for it will change your life.</p>
<p>But you desire the Revelation, for it will change your life.</p>
<p>It is your conflict of mind that blinds you.</p>
<p>It is the purposes that run counter to one another that keep you in a state of confusion and do not allow you to see.</p>
<p>We are the Ones who have brought all of the Revelations into the world.</p>
<p>For God does not speak.</p>
<p>God is not a person or a personage or a personality or a singular awareness.</p>
<p>To think like this is to underestimate the Creator and to overestimate yourself.</p>
<p>It is We who spoke to Jesus and the Buddha, the Mohammad and other teachers and seers through the ages who have brought a greater clarity into the world—to the prophets in every age and to the Messengers who only come at great turning points for humanity.</p>
<p>You cannot worship Us.</p>
<p>You will not know Our names.</p>
<p>For you must now become responsible and utilize the skills and the power the Creator has given you in service to a world of increasing need, turbulence and upheaval.</p>
<p>Do not prostrate yourself to the Creator if you are unwilling to carry out what you were sent here to do, if you cannot take the Steps to Knowledge, if you have the arrogance to think you can determine your fate and your destiny and fulfillment.</p>
<p>Do not be hypocritical.</p>
<p>Do not fall down and worship the God whom you cannot serve or will not serve.</p>
<p>It is better then to live your self-determined life and face all of the hazards of this than it is to worship a God whom you cannot serve.</p>
<p>If you cannot respond to the Revelation, then what are you doing here now?</p>
<p>Every Messenger has been persecuted.</p>
<p>Every Messenger has been misunderstood.</p>
<p>Every New Revelation has been resisted and denied and disputed.</p>
<p>There is no time for this now.</p>
<p>The fate of humanity will be determined in the next 20 years—the condition of the world, the condition of the human family, the fate and the future of human civilization.</p>
<p>You are no longer alone in the world or even in the universe. Of course.</p>
<p>You do not know what is occurring and what is coming over the horizon because you are too afraid to see and too arrogant, assuming that you know.</p>
<p>That is why the Revelation must be given to show you what you cannot see and do not know. beyond human speculation and estimation.</p>
<p>This is embedded in all of the Teachings of the New Message.</p>
<p>This is the New Message.</p>
<p>Struggle against this and you struggle against your own recognition.</p>
<p>For you must come to know of the greater mind and the greater strength the Creator has given you.</p>
<p>Taught in every religion but clouded and obscured by every religion, this is what must be recognized now.</p>
<p>God is not managing the world.</p>
<p>God is not creating the catastrophes, the storms, the earthquakes, the floods, the droughts.</p>
<p>God is watching to see how humanity will deal with a world it has changed—a new world, a new and unpredictable world.</p>
<p>Humanity is emerging into a Greater Community of life in the universe because others are here to seek influence and domination of a world of great value and importance.</p>
<p>But the people do not see.</p>
<p>They do not hear.</p>
<p>And if they think at all, it is to create an understanding that affirms their ideas and their beliefs.</p>
<p>And so the peoples do not see.</p>
<p>The nations do not prepare.</p>
<p>And the destructive behavior continues.</p>
<p>We watch over the world.</p>
<p>We have been watching for a very long time.</p>
<p>We are those that God has sent to oversee humanity’s development and evolution and to receive the Revelations that are then given to the Messengers, to receive the insights that are given to the prophets, to sound the warnings, to provide the blessings and now to provide the preparation for a world unlike the past you have experienced and for a future where humanity will have to contend with the Greater Community itself.</p>
<p>God will not save humanity by driving away the evil, by ending the problems that humanity has created or the problems it must face as a natural part of its evolution.</p>
<p>To think of this is to misunderstand your relationship with the Divine, as you now live in a state of Separation.</p>
<p>But the Separation was never completed because there is a part of you that is still connected to God.</p>
<p>This We call Knowledge.</p>
<p>And this will prove to be the decisive factor in the outcome of your personal life—the meaning and the value of your life—and whether humanity can prepare, adapt and create in a new world, in a new set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Never before has such a Revelation been given to the human family, for it was not needed.</p>
<p>You have created a civilization in the world.</p>
<p>Fractured and divided it is, but it is a civilization.</p>
<p>You have become increasingly interdependent between your nations and cultures.</p>
<p>This was the intention of the Creator, for this is the natural evolution of humanity and all intelligent races in the universe.</p>
<p>Now you must face the next great threshold—a world in decline, a world of declining resources, a world of declining stability, a world of diminishing food and water, a world where a growing humanity will have to face the conditions of the world.</p>
<p>For this you need the New Revelation.</p>
<p>The past Revelations of the Creator cannot prepare you for the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>They cannot prepare you for your destiny in the Greater Community.</p>
<p>They cannot prepare you for the great thresholds that are now upon you and will be upon you increasingly.</p>
<p>You do not have answers in the face of these things.</p>
<p>That is why the Revelation is being given, for humanity now needs to be advised and warned, blessed and given the preparation for a future that will be unlike the past.</p>
<p>Hear these words, not with your intellect but with your heart.</p>
<p>They speak to a greater truth within you—a greater truth beyond concepts, beliefs and ideas.</p>
<p>They speak to a natural resonance within you, a natural affinity, a natural inclination, a natural direction that lives within you every moment, beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect.</p>
<p>This is a communication to your deeper nature—to amplify it, to call it forth, to set it in contrast to your ideas, your beliefs and your activities as they exist today.</p>
<p>You are unprepared.</p>
<p>God has sent the preparation.</p>
<p>You are unaware.</p>
<p>God is providing the awareness.</p>
<p>You are uncertain.</p>
<p>God is calling you to the center of certainty within yourself.</p>
<p>You are conflicted.</p>
<p>God is providing the pathway out of conflict.</p>
<p>You are self-demeaning and demeaning of others.</p>
<p>God is restoring to you your true value and purpose in the world.</p>
<p>The world is changing, but you do not see.</p>
<p>God has given you the eyes to see and the ears to hear, but they are different from what you do today and what you understand today.</p>
<p>Humanity will fail without the New Revelation.</p>
<p>The world will become ever darker, more dangerous and conflicted without the Revelation.</p>
<p>Humanity will falter and fail in the face of its own errors and lack of clarity.</p>
<p>The resources of the world will be spent through conflict, competition and war.</p>
<p>People will rise up against their governments.</p>
<p>People will rise up against one another.</p>
<p>There will be untold conflict in the future, greater and more continuous than anything you have seen before.</p>
<p>It is the New Revelation that holds the missing ingredients to your understanding, the key to your awareness and the source of your power, strength and determination.</p>
<p>For this you must have a serious mind, take your life seriously and begin to attend to the greater needs and requirements of your life.</p>
<p>That is why God has sent the Revelation.</p>
<p>This is the Revelation.</p>
<p>We are the Revelation.</p>
<p>There are no heroes to worship now, no individuals to deify, only greater responsibility to be assumed and a greater wisdom to be utilized.</p>
<p>There is no escape through personal enlightenment.</p>
<p>There is no running away.</p>
<p>There is no self-deception.</p>
<p>There is only greater resonance and responsibility, greater sacrifice and contribution.</p>
<p>That is what will save the world.</p>
<p>That is what will save humanity’s freedom and self-determination in a universe where freedom is rare and must be protected very carefully.</p>
<p>This is what will restore dignity to the individual and the ability to contribute something of greater power and significance, no matter what your circumstances may be.</p>
<p>Hear these words—not with your ideas, your beliefs or your contentions, but with your heart, your deeper nature.</p>
<p>For God can only speak to what God has created in you.</p>
<p>God did not create your social personality.</p>
<p>God did not create your ideas and beliefs.</p>
<p>God did not create your decisions, your failures and your regrets.</p>
<p>God can only speak to what God created in you, which is something deeper, more pervasive and more natural within you.</p>
<p>The New Message is calling to you.</p>
<p>Once you become aware of it, then you must face the challenge of recognition and what this will mean for your life.</p>
<p>People reject the Revelation because they do not want to change.</p>
<p>They do not want to have to reconsider their beliefs, their ideas and their position in society.</p>
<p>They cannot dispute the New Message, really.</p>
<p>They can only avoid it and contend against it to protect their previous investment and idea of themselves.</p>
<p>Who can contend against the will and the wisdom of the Creator, except on spurious grounds?</p>
<p>Here you will see the dilemma facing each person.</p>
<p>How honest do they really want to be with themselves, what they see and know?</p>
<p>How aware do they really want to be of themselves, their situation and the world around them?</p>
<p>How responsible are they willing to be to bring their life into balance and to make the difficult decisions they have failed to make before?</p>
<p>Here you will see the intellect parading as a kind of god when, in fact, it is an exquisite servant.</p>
<p>That is its purpose and its design.</p>
<p>Here you will see arrogance and ignorance wedded together in a self-deceptive form that so many people adhere to.</p>
<p>You will see what is great and what is small, what is strong and what is weak, what is true and what is false, what is precious and what only pretends to be precious.</p>
<p>The Revelation reveals everything.</p>
<p>It calls on you to follow what is great within you and to manage what is small.</p>
<p>It does not speak of any middle ground in this regard.</p>
<p>You cannot have everything.</p>
<p>You cannot have your future and your past together because they are not compatible.</p>
<p>It is only through disappointment and failure that you come to see that you are not living the life you were meant to live and that you are not being honest and true to yourself and honest and true with others—a harsh but necessary reckoning in a time of reckoning, a time of realization, a time of Revelation.</p>
<p>Listen to these words—not with your ideas, your assumptions, not with your defenses, not with arrogance, pride or foolishness but with your deeper nature, for that is what must be revealed to you.</p>
<p>That is part of the Revelation.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on May 23, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>Today we shall tell the story of the Messenger. It is a story that holds great power and meaning if it can be comprehended.</p>
<p>For the Messenger is no ordinary person, though he appears to be ordinary on the outside. And because he is a humble man, he does not exalt himself in any way. He seeks not recognition but a deeper connection with those who are destined to meet him and to receive God’s New Revelation.</p>
<p>In this sense, he is understated and will remain silent with others. His proclamation is not of himself but of the Revelation, for that is why he has come. That is his reason for being in the world.</p>
<p>However, for most of his life so far, he was not aware of this. For his calling came later in life at a time when he was prepared to receive it and to begin the long preparation that would be required to prepare to receive the Revelation and then to receive the Revelation itself.</p>
<p>Forty years it would take to do all of this. Forty years of being available, of treading the wilderness without a certain outcome, without realizing the significance of his endeavor. Forty years without other serious obligations beyond his family. Forty years to develop the trust and the confidence and the allegiance and the integrity that would be needed to become the Messenger.</p>
<p>Before he was sent into the world, the Angelic Host prepared him and placed deep within his mind the awareness and the understanding that he would later bring into the world—Knowledge and wisdom from the universe, from the most advanced races in the universe; an understanding of the future of the world and where humanity is heading in its evolution and all of the great hazards and risks associated with this; a greater understanding of human relationships that would give him a greater maturity as he would grow up in the world.</p>
<p>These were all placed deep within him, beneath the surface of the mind—later to be discovered, later to emerge and later to resonate with the Revelation itself. For the Revelation would not be foreign to him because of what has been given to him before he came into the world.</p>
<p>He was sent to a family, a conservative family, living in America, a family that would have no notion of his greater destiny and greater comprehension. There he would grow up with a minimum of influences from the world, insulated and sheltered from the tragedies and corruption of the world around him. He would grow up in a family with two older brothers and with an ill father, a father who would otherwise have had undue influence upon him.</p>
<p>It was setting the stage for something in the distant future to emerge. He would go through school, graduate from the university and the only awareness he would have is that he had a greater and very unusual destiny and purpose in the world. He was restrained from giving himself to any career or to any relationship, restrained from committing his life before the Revelation could occur.</p>
<p>During this period, he would learn a great deal about the condition of the world and about human relationships. He would meet many people and taste the sorrows and pleasures of this world to a certain extent, but always being withheld for something greater.</p>
<p>For this, he would have to develop trust that his life was not being lost or wasted. The Presence was only with him to the extent that it could maintain his true direction and aim his life towards the sacred rendezvous that would happen much later.</p>
<p>When he was 33 years old, We presented Ourselves to him, and the initiation began—an initiation that would alter everything about his life. Yet because of who he was and what had been given to him, the resonance would be there. Our presence and Our purpose would not be foreign to him—only shocking and new and uncertain.</p>
<p>A year later he would meet his great partner, his wife, who would journey with him through all the difficult and formative years that would be required for him to prepare for his greater role in life. His son would emerge soon thereafter, and he too would have a greater destiny with his father.</p>
<p>Others would come to join him as he began his long preparation. Not all of them would be able to stay with him, however. Some would falter and fall by the wayside or could only provide support for a very short time. Yet his true companions would begin to arrive as he would make progress in his preparation.</p>
<p>When he was 40 years old, he was given the Steps to Knowledge, the great Teaching of the Revelation, the Book of Practices. He would be prepared to receive this in a very short time, under extraordinary circumstances. This would begin another stage in his preparation to be the Messenger. But even at this age, he would not yet know of his destiny and his future role, for these things cannot be revealed too soon or the person can become terrified or overwhelmed and withdraw or seek escape. So the realization of his destiny and his significant role in the world would only be given incrementally as he made progress.</p>
<p>During this time, he tried to have others be with him in his inexplicable journey, but few could join him beyond his wife and son and a few other individuals. For who can travel the road of Mystery and maintain their health and well-being and stability in the world in the process?</p>
<p>For Marshall to be able to become the Messenger, he would have to have a foot in both worlds—a foot in the real world of human interactions, human relationships and the difficulties and complexities of relations between nations. He would have to see things that were very troubling. He could not hide in a preferential world, believing in only happy things or beautiful things or spiritual things.</p>
<p>He would have to have a foot in the Mystery, deeply anchored there so that the challenges and the temptations of the future would not take him out of his role and purpose. Who in the world can understand these things? Who in the world has ever met the Messenger or can comprehend the mystery and the power of his presence in the world?</p>
<p>Many people will simply want things from the Messenger—miracles, dispensations, favors. They want to be healed. They want to be blessed. They want to be enriched. They want to be rescued. They want to be saved. They do not care who he is as long as he can provide these things, and then they will believe, but only to receive, you see. His journey, therefore, would be lonely, isolated, beyond the range of even those who were sent to accompany him, to assist him.</p>
<p>He would have to live in two worlds, bridging two realities—so very unlike each other they are. Who can do this without losing their mind or falling apart or being seduced by darker forces in the world or being overtaken by tragedy and loss and deprivation? It has been a very long road to travel, a very challenging road with many hazards, but the Messenger has arrived at his destination.</p>
<p>It has taken him twenty-five years to receive the Revelation, it is so great. It is the largest Revelation ever given to this world because the world is a literate world, a world of human communities and a world community, a world of global transportation, global infrastructure and communications.</p>
<p>Here you are not preparing to live some sweet pastoral life somewhere. You are preparing for a world in decline, a world of diminishing resources and growing economic and political upheaval, and you are facing the reality of life in the universe—a reality that poses hazards, dangers and opportunities that humanity has not yet recognized.</p>
<p>These are things that the Messenger has been prepared to speak on, for they are part of the Revelation, as they are part of humanity’s destiny—a destiny that few in the world can yet see clearly without distortion or personal preference.</p>
<p>The Messenger appears ordinary. He is a humble man. He will not assert himself personally. But within him is the mystery and the power of Creation, and the bridge between this world and the Divine Presence that oversees this world.</p>
<p>He is partly one of Us and partly one of you. He has to maintain both realities and be the shepherd to lead people up the mountain that is their mountain to climb.</p>
<p>Is he as great as the great Emissaries of the past? Only time and circumstance will tell. He will not proclaim this himself, you see, because the ambitious are never chosen. Those who seek self-glorification are never given greater roles to play or greater Messages for humanity. Only those who are reluctant and honest and self-reflective would ever be chosen for such a high and significant role.</p>
<p>For there is only one Messenger in the world, and this Messenger will be the Messenger for this time and the times to come. No one else asserting this for themselves can bring the Revelation. No one else can travel the journey that the Messenger has had to travel.</p>
<p>Others will give important gifts where they are needed, and ultimately everyone is meant to do this, for that is part of each person’s purpose. Everyone will be a conduit for a greater Presence and Power. But there is only one Messenger, whose Message will alter the course of human understanding and speak of the great change that will change the course of human destiny and evolution.</p>
<p>Without the New Message from God, humanity would fall into grave conflicts and precipitous decline, making you vulnerable to foreign powers who are already in this world to gain influence and authority here. People do not realize they are standing at the precipice, not only of great change, but also of subjugation.</p>
<p>This is the Greater Darkness in the world, a Greater Darkness that most people are too afraid to even think about. But it is something that humanity must prepare for, and that is why God has given a New Revelation.</p>
<p>A new Prophet has come into the world. Judge him as you may. Exalt him or deny him. Call him great or call him other things. People’s estimation has nothing to do with the reality. For what people want and what God knows are not the same. What people think and where the world is going are not the same.</p>
<p>The Messenger will be denied. He will be ridiculed. Others will attack him. Others will feel threatened by his presence and his proclamations—not because he is wrong but because they cannot face the fact that God has spoken again. They do not have the courage or the humility to reconsider their position, their ideas or their previous investment in themselves.</p>
<p>This is the challenge of meeting the Messenger. He brings a whole new reality with him, in him, around him and through him—a reality that humanity is not yet mature enough to face collectively. Only individuals will be ready for him, for they have been made ready through their life experience, through disillusionment, disappointment and other things.</p>
<p>There are many people waiting for the New Revelation. They must know of the Messenger, for he is the demonstration that the Power and the Presence has come back into the world.</p>
<p>To see this, you must look with clear eyes. You must listen. You must listen with a deeper listening. You must allow the power of Knowledge, the deeper intelligence within you, to respond.</p>
<p>For if you judge the Messenger based upon ideas or your own projections of fear and blame, you will not see and you will not know. If you cannot receive God’s New Revelation, then what can God really do for you? If you cannot follow what God has put within you to follow, the power and the presence of Knowledge, what else can God do for you or the world?</p>
<p>There are countless worlds in the universe, inhabited worlds. This is only one. The Lord of this world is the Lord of all worlds. It is not a human universe you are facing, and that is why your notions of Heaven and Hell are so incorrect, so limited and really pathetic.</p>
<p>It is to take you into the Greater Community that represents part of the purpose of the Messenger and of the New Revelation.</p>
<p>The Messenger is facing a monumental task. He alone cannot bring the Revelation into the world. It will require the participation, the contribution and the communication of many others who can assist him in this way.</p>
<p>The Revelation has been given with its own Commentary and in such great detail and repetition that it will not rely so greatly upon human interpretation as have the previous Messages that have been given to humanity. It brings with it the understanding of spirituality at the level of Knowledge—Knowledge and wisdom from the Greater Community—a preparation for a new and declining world, a great teaching on human relationships and responsibility and what nations must know to cooperate with one another in the face of the great change that is coming.</p>
<p>This is not one man’s philosophy. This is beyond philosophy. This is not associated with any world religion. This is the beginning of a whole new understanding. This is not a rejection or reaction to the world’s religions. This is a New Message from God. The Messenger is in the world. He will not be in the world for a whole long, long time to come, and that is why he must be recognized, for those who have this great opportunity.</p>
<p>His life has been inexplicable. His presence is inexplicable. You must see with clear eyes and listen with a deeper hearing to recognize these things. The burden then is upon the listener, upon the recipient.</p>
<p>The Messenger has received almost the entire communication. It is enough to last for generations and centuries. For no one can tell you how to prepare for the new world. No one can tell you how to prepare for a Greater Community of intelligent life—a competitive environment on a scale you cannot even imagine. No one can tell you of the deeper mind. No one can provide the New Revelation.</p>
<p>The Revelations are always given to one individual, so there is no confusion. There are no different versions. There is no competition between different individuals who make the same claim and proclamation. It is always one individual with the assistance of certain courageous people that can bring a new awareness and reality into the world.</p>
<p>Every age has its prophets, but Messengers only come infrequently to alter the course of human understanding, awareness and destiny.</p>
<p>You will see that the Messenger will be judged. He will be condemned. Others will make it their purpose to destroy him. Learn the lessons from the past in this regard. He is not simply here to sacrifice himself so that other people can create a story about him. He has his own story—a story of the Messenger, a story he is too humble to speak of, a story that must be revealed to all who can hear and understand.</p>
<p>People want the Messenger to be many things, to meet their desires, their beliefs and their preferences. But the Messenger has been prepared by Greater Powers and sent from the Divine to be in the world according to a Greater Plan and destiny.</p>
<p>Be careful then in how you approach this rare and significant individual. Be careful regarding your expectations, your beliefs, your preconceived ideas, your judgments and your grievances. For these can all blind you to who he is and to what he can offer to you and to the whole world.</p>
<p>May the Blessing be with him. The Power and the Presence is with him. He is fallible. He is not perfect. He will face many difficulties. It is what is in him and with him and through him that is perfect. His life is a vehicle for this, as your life is a vehicle for something important as well. But he is the seed of a greater future for humanity, a new understanding of your existence within a Greater Community of life and of the great turning point that humanity is now beginning to undergo.</p>
<p>Let this be your understanding, but do not come to conclusions, for the awareness of the Messenger is only just beginning.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on May 17, 2011<br />
in Glenwood Springs, Colorado</p>
<p>Many people in the world are awaiting the return of their Savior, their Maitreya or their Imam. But God has sent a New Message into the world, a Message to prepare humanity for the great change that is coming here and for its encounter with intelligent life in the universe, an encounter that will be far more precarious and dangerous than most people truly recognize.</p>
<p>Human spirituality is eroding away in the world, the true nature of human spirituality. The deeper nature of each person is becoming ever more remote as your societies become increasingly technological and secular. The divisions between religions are so severe and so damaging, even the divisions within religions, they will add a great deal to human conflict and suffering in the future, as they are now.</p>
<p>To honestly look at the world is to realize that its mounting difficulties are exceeding human capacity and understanding. The Great Waves of change coming to the world exceed what individuals and institutions can fully comprehend and address.</p>
<p>Humanity has come to a great turning point. It cannot return to its former state. It cannot go backwards in history. It cannot simply reaffirm the divided and contentious beliefs of its religious traditions, which were all initiated by God.</p>
<p>God’s Revelation must now come again and has come again, and the Messenger has been sent into the world—a humble man, a man without great social position, a man without great personal assertions and accomplishments, a man whose life has been preserved and directed for this purpose alone.</p>
<p>People will argue, of course, unwilling or unable to reconsider their position and to open themselves to the New Revelation. They think they understand God’s will and purpose for the peoples of this world. They think they understand what Revelation means and when it can occur.</p>
<p>They think they understand. But who can understand this fully? Who has the wisdom and the breadth and the capacity to understand this fully? Surely this must exceed human comprehension. And surely there must be enough humility and honesty for people to realize that they cannot predict when and how the Creator of all the universes will speak to this one tiny little planet.</p>
<p>Human ignorance and arrogance unite into a dangerous combination, a combination that is vehement and oppressive. It is jaded and highly opinionated. It is polarized and will continue to divide the human family—a division that can only weaken you in the face of the great change that is coming to the world.</p>
<p>The New Message comes here in a pure form, and for the first time you will be able to hear the Voice of Revelation. It was a Voice like this that spoke to Moses and Jesus, the Buddha and Mohammad and the other great Teachers who have remained hidden throughout the course of human history.</p>
<p>There is no time for error now. The risks are too great. Everything is being done with the New Revelation to make it very clear. It provides its own Commentary, its own Teachings, for these cannot be left up to human interpretation only.</p>
<p>The hour is late and humanity is unprepared to face a new and declining world and to face the realities and the difficulties of emerging into a Greater Community of life in the universe.</p>
<p>You are at a great threshold, and for you individually this means that your life is being accelerated to meet this threshold, to prepare for this threshold, to engage with this threshold.</p>
<p>But how can this be done without a New Revelation from God? There is not a person on Earth who has the wisdom, the capacity and the comprehension to deal with everything humanity will be facing as it passes through this threshold into a new and more challenging world.</p>
<p>Who on Earth can prepare humanity for life in the universe, the great engagement—an engagement that is already taking place, in secrecy, carried out by groups who are here to take advantage of your ignorance and superstitions?</p>
<p>If you are truly honest, you must recognize that no one has this breadth of understanding, this capacity. No one in the world understands the Greater Community of life. And what people think are projections of their fears and their fantasies, neither of which is an accurate portrayal of what you will be facing in reality.</p>
<p>The true nature of human spirituality has now been so clouded, so distorted, so overlaid with tradition and ritual and interpretation that even the great traditions of the world, which can provide the steps that you must take, require a unique and highly gifted teacher to navigate everything else that has been added over the decades and centuries.</p>
<p>Religion has become a palliative. It has become a distraction more than an illumination. It has become something that people [use to] run away from the world to seek comfort and consolation instead of a preparation to engage in the world in a greater and more profound way.</p>
<p>The Creator knows all this, of course. It is beyond debate at a higher level. It is beyond speculation. It is beyond ideology. It is beyond the theology of one religion contending against the theology of another religion. That is a human problem created by human misunderstanding and the limits of human capacity and wisdom.</p>
<p>You may argue against the Revelation, but it is the only Revelation, and it will be the only Revelation. Whether it is accepted or denied, this is it.</p>
<p>God is not preoccupied with this one world. But God is aware of this one world—a very small place in a very great universe.</p>
<p>The Angelic Presence that oversees this world is translating the Will of the Creator into words and application, Teachings and Commentary that the people of the Earth can understand and apply today and tomorrow and the days to follow.</p>
<p>You are asked to receive, not to judge.</p>
<p>You are asked to prepare for the world, not to use religion as a form of escape.</p>
<p>You are asked to honor your deeper nature and to take the Steps to Knowledge so that its reality can become apparent to you.</p>
<p>You are asked to end your ceaseless conflicts and to never think that you can conduct violence here on Earth in the name of God, for that is an abomination. There are no holy warriors. There is nothing holy about war.</p>
<p>You are asked to learn and to prepare for a new world and to prepare for the realities and challenges and opportunities of emerging into a larger arena of intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>You cannot teach yourself these things, for you do not know enough. And to argue against it is only to project your own limits and misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The New Message is being brought to the people—not to the experts, not to the leaders, for they are too invested in their position, and as a result, they either cannot see what is coming or they are unable to communicate the truth to those who follow them.</p>
<p>The Revelation gives the individual tremendous power, but also tremendous responsibilities. If you are guided by the power of Knowledge within yourself, the deeper intelligence that God has placed within you, then there can be no violence or war and conflict. There is only the effort to create positive and mutually beneficial arrangements with others.</p>
<p>That is the work for the intellect. That is the great challenge before you, a challenge so great it will occupy all of your energy if you are to undertake it successfully.</p>
<p>The Revelation is beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect. It is beyond the realm and reach of beliefs and ideology. For God does not create belief. God does not create ideology. God only gives you wisdom and clarity and a high standard to live by. You are either able to adopt these things, or you are not.</p>
<p>To adopt them, you must adopt them compassionately, without using them as a weapon to oppress others or to condemn others. To condemn others to Hell and damnation is to misunderstand God’s Revelations, both present and in the past.</p>
<p>To claim that there can be no new Revelations is to proclaim your arrogance and ignorance and to think that you know more than the Creator. For no one on Earth knows what God will do next. Even the Angelic Presence does not know what God will do next, so what person can make such a claim? Surely it is the epitome of ignorance and arrogance!</p>
<p>No one on Earth can proclaim that Jesus is the only pathway to God when God has created other pathways! Who are you to say such things? This is misunderstanding and confusion. This is trying to place your beliefs above and beyond others’ beliefs, to make your teacher, your representative, the greatest or the only one to be followed. This is not the Will of Heaven. This is the ignorance of humanity.</p>
<p>The world you will be facing will require immense human cooperation, compassion and contribution, or it will be a battleground over who has the remaining resources of the world. Who can protect their wealth while other nations fail and collapse?</p>
<p>The demands upon humanity will be so great that it will take a great compassion and wisdom to respond to this. But the peoples are too divided. The religions are too shattered. This group opposes that group in the name of their national sovereignty or the Will of God, and it is all set in motion to collapse into chaos.</p>
<p>That is why there is a New Revelation in the world. Here you do not praise the Messenger as a God. You honor him as the Messenger. Here you do not proclaim your ideas over another, but realize that ideas are only the tools to be used by the greater strength within you and that the true truth, the greater truth, resides beyond the realm of the intellect, which was never designed to comprehend the greater realities of life.</p>
<p>The Will of Heaven is for humanity to unite and to prepare so that it may survive the Great Waves of change and prepare for its engagement with life in the universe in such a way that human freedom and sovereignty in this world may be protected.</p>
<p>For you are facing a non-human universe where freedom is rare and where free nations and peoples must exercise great discretion and great care amidst the presence of many more nations where freedom has been suppressed or where it was never known before.</p>
<p>The demands of the Greater Community are tremendous. You cannot be engaged in constant conflict here on Earth and be able to survive and remain free in this larger arena of life. It is a matter not of perspective or belief. It is a matter of necessity.</p>
<p>For nations to survive environmental decline in this world and increasing political and economic upheaval and difficulty, you will have to cooperate with each other. Instead of fighting, you will have to find ways to provide enough food, water and energy for the people of the world. That will be the prevailing and dominating need of the future here on Earth.</p>
<p>People who think otherwise are living in the past. Their assumptions are based upon the past. They cannot see what is occurring in their midst. They cannot ascertain what is coming over the horizon. They are living in a shell of their own beliefs and assumptions and are blind to the realities of the world today and tomorrow. They think engagement with the universe will be the result of human exploration, but that is rarely ever the case in the universe. Intervention occurs when nations become stronger and more united. That is when the challenge to freedom and sovereignty really begins.</p>
<p>Your education about the universe and your preparation for living and surviving in the new world are so great and tremendous, they have required a New Revelation from God. The clarification of the nature, purpose and unity of the human spirit must now be emphasized beyond all other things, or humanity will not find the strength or the unity to respond to the great change that is upon you.</p>
<p>A New Revelation brings great correction and clarification, which are necessary now if all the religious traditions of the world are to add wisdom to the human family and not merely add to its partisanship, conflict and contention. They each have a contribution to make. They are all important. One is not greater than another. To think like this is not to understand the Will of Heaven, for it is only a united humanity that will be able to contend with the challenges of living in a new world and with the greater challenges of preserving your freedom and sovereignty amidst the presence of greater forces in the universe.</p>
<p>This is the time. You are living at a time of Revelation. It is a precious time. It is a difficult time. It is a confusing time. It is a time of great consequence.</p>
<p>You are amongst the first to respond to the New Revelation. It is for a purpose that this is so. It is no accident that this is so. You who are still trying to plan your own fulfillment in life do not yet realize you have a greater destiny here, a destiny that will be uniquely expressed in your life, but it is a destiny you will share with others, for no one is in the world by accident now.</p>
<p>Everyone was sent here to contend with the conditions of the world. But this preparation occurs at a deeper level of the mind, at the level of Knowledge. This is the part of you that has never been separate from God. It is the part of you that was and is your true identity. It was Knowledge that brought you into the world. It is Knowledge that will carry you through the world. It will be Knowledge that will emerge with you beyond the world.</p>
<p>The separated are redeemed through Knowledge. The wicked are reclaimed through Knowledge. The foolish are made wise through Knowledge. This is how God redeems not only the human family, but all of Creation that is living in Separation, which is represented by the physical universe that you can only imagine.</p>
<p>It is the Will of Heaven that you respond to the New Revelation. It is the Will of Heaven that you take the Steps to Knowledge, patiently, without presumption, setting aside your beliefs, your preferences and your fears as you proceed so that you may engage with a greater strength, a greater integrity and a great purpose within yourself.</p>
<p>It is the Will of Heaven that this awareness and preparation be shared with others and that you become a vehicle for sharing it, very simply, by pointing to the New Revelation.</p>
<p>It is the Will of Heaven that humanity will grow up, emerge out of its reckless and contentious adolescence to become the wise stewards of this world, to preserve the life-giving resources of this world and to become a free race in a universe where freedom is rare and is rarely valued.</p>
<p>It is the Will of Heaven that you end your ceaseless conflicts, for you cannot afford to destroy your peoples and your cities now. You will need all the resources of the world, all the resources that you have, to contend with the Great Waves of change that are coming.</p>
<p>You are not living in the past. The old world has passed. You are living in a new world—a world with an unstable climate and changing environmental conditions, a world of diminishing resources, a world of ever greater fragility, ever greater uncertainty, where even human civilization itself is imperiled.</p>
<p>But who will see this? Who will hear this, not with their ideas or their opinions or their beliefs, but deeply, more profoundly? Who has the courage to face this? Who has the humility to face the New Revelation? Who can admit that God has more to say to humanity and give up self-righteousness and all of the admonitions and declarations that accompany it?</p>
<p>The Will of Heaven and the intentions of humanity are still very far apart. But the times grow dark. The hour is late, and there is no more time for foolishness and denial.</p>
<p>It is the time of Revelation. It is the gift to humanity, to be received or rejected. It is the future of humanity, to be fulfilled or to be destroyed. It is the promise of humanity, to be realized and expressed or to be squandered and wasted. This is a great decision, not only for people elsewhere, but for you, within yourself.</p>
<p>Everything is based on the decisions of the individual, and that is why the New Message from God speaks to this very directly. It does not simply prescribe a new belief system, a new yoke of ideology to which everyone must yield and be oppressed. People will have to work out the details. But the motivation must be true. The awareness must be there.</p>
<p>There must be greater clarity about what you are dealing with and will have to face in the future, and this will moderate your errant and destructive behavior. This will give you pause before you condemn or attack another people or nation. This will moderate extremism and fundamentalism and all of the arrogance and ignorance that manifests itself with such vehemence and eloquence in the world.</p>
<p>You must hear this with your heart. Do not delay, for every day is important now. Time cannot be wasted now. The Messenger is here. He will not be here forever. You are blessed to hear him and to meet him if possible. He carries within him the Revelation, beyond what is produced in a book or a recording.</p>
<p>Receive him. Hear him. And your life will demonstrate the proof of the truth that abides with him, in him and through him.</p>

As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 30, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<h6>[Read also the <a title="The Great Waves of Change" href="http://www.greatwavesofchange.org"><em>New Message Book of Prophecy</em></a>]</h6>
<p>God seeks to prepare humanity for a new world, a new reality, and for its encounter with life in the universe, an encounter that will change and determine the future and destiny of humanity.</p>
<p>You are entering a new world—a world of environmental change, a world of violent weather, a world that is unpredictable, a world that will be unbalanced, with great political and economic difficulties. Nations will be shaken by revolution, and national economies will fail.</p>
<p>It is the outcome of many forces at work that have been at work for some time. The wise can foresee this. For everyone else, it will be a great shock—the shock of the future.</p>
<p>Do not look upon this as a great tragedy or something to avoid, neglect or deny, for this has your name upon it. You were sent into the world to serve the world under these conditions.</p>
<p>Though you perhaps have not been mindful of the Great Waves of change that are beginning to sweep across the world, they are moving nonetheless. It is not a time for complacency. It is not a time to project your ideas or beliefs. It is not a time to argue and debate endlessly.</p>
<p>It is a time to look and to see and to keep looking and watching, discerning the horizon, discerning the changing circumstances of life around you, discerning the change that is occurring in people’s lives—unanticipated change, overwhelming change, beyond the normal parameters of life.</p>
<p>Perhaps your life has been changing internally and externally as if in preparation for something great that you would have to serve and be a part of. If this is your experience, then you can be certain that you are preparing for the new world, however unconsciously.</p>
<p>God has given you Knowledge to guide you and to prepare you, but Knowledge functions beneath the surface of the mind where people live. It is a greater intelligence. It is discerning the movement of the world, and it is responding to the Creator.</p>
<p>God’s New Revelation will speak to this part of you more than to your intellect, for this is the part of you that has never left God. Therefore, it is the part of you that can truly respond. It is the part of you that is wise and unconflicted. It is not afraid of the world, for it cannot be destroyed.</p>
<p>At the surface of your mind, you suffer over every little thing, and you have great anxieties about your future and well-being—always the fear of future loss, always the fear of the innumerable things that can happen to you and to those that you care for.</p>
<p>How can you ever know anything at this level, so filled with fear and ambition, so easily distracted, so easily manipulated, so easily controlled, so easily dominated by the opinions or the determinations of others?</p>
<p>The shock of the future will be a shock because you are unprepared. You have not been paying attention. You have been obsessed with other things of little or no significance. You have been caught up in the affairs of the day and in your own feelings, memories and regrets, not mindful of the world around you.</p>
<p>With preparation, there is no shock. There is only confirmation. Even that which is shocking will not overwhelm you. It will surprise and dismay you perhaps in the moment, but you will not be overtaken by it. You will not be paralyzed by it, frozen in fear, without any idea of what to do. When the ship begins to list and takes on water, you will be ready. You will not be frozen. You will not go down with the ship.</p>
<p>God has given you the power to save you, not only from calamities in the world, but from every disaster and every miscalculation that you can make and experience along the way.</p>
<p>You may pray to God for many things—for protection, for advantages, for a happy outcome—but God has given you the greatest possible gift. But if it is unknown or resisted or neglected, what else can God do for you?</p>
<p>God is not managing the affairs of the day. God is not moving the blood through your veins. God is not whipping up the winds or setting the temperature. This is a world of cascading events. It has no seeming order to it.</p>
<p>The forces of the world—the geologic and biological forces—were set in motion at the beginning of time. They are moving on their own. The degree to which humanity has upset the Earth’s delicate balance will produce great events and is producing great events even at this moment.</p>
<p>But who is paying attention? Who is realizing the cause and the effect? Who is listening to the power and the presence that reside within them?</p>
<p>People vacillate between excitement and dread. They seek love as a kind of escape and intoxication to free them from the constant burden and overshadowing of fear and regret, whereas real love remains a mystery to them, real love emanating from Knowledge.</p>
<p>The world, in its great change, can serve you if you can approach it correctly. The shock of the world can prepare you. It can shake you out of your dreams of happiness and disaster. It can bring you to your senses. It can call upon your strengths and your determination and most certainly your compassion for people.</p>
<p>You are entering the age of human responsibility and cooperation. You must be a part of this, or your life will be wasted. Your life will be always threatened.</p>
<p>People want to retire into kind of a listless happiness, without a care, but when you see this, it is pathetic. It is sad. There is no intelligence. There is no inspiration. There is no honesty. There is no true connection with others. There is no service and contribution. They have cast themselves out of the meaning of life in their life of constant repose.</p>
<p>This is not for you. You did not make the long journey into this world and go through the stages of growth and development as a person with all of its difficulties simply to be put out on the pasture somewhere.</p>
<p>Those who sent you into the world are counting on your development and preparation. They know that that will be the source of meaning, happiness and contentment in your life.</p>
<p>Affluence will fade in the world. It will be lost by many people. The human need will become so great that it will call upon people everywhere to serve and to participate.</p>
<p>The ship is already taking on water, you see. It is already beginning to list to one side. Those who know this are being called to respond, to prepare themselves and to see where their contribution can be of the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>The future shock is for them right now—the shock of realization, the shock of having to turn your life in a new direction, the shock of realizing how little meaning and purpose have been in your life previously and how you have wasted yourself, your time and your valuable energy on things that have little or no promise.</p>
<p>This is the shock of the future, the future shock, happening at this moment as you begin to pay attention and to respond to the signs of the world.</p>
<p>God is calling you through these signs. God is not calling you to return to your heavenly state, but to enter into the world for the purpose that you have come.</p>
<p>This will change your values and your priorities. This will change what you look for in others. This will change what you value in yourself. This will change your relationship with time. This will change your experience of relationships. This will change your relationship with your mind and your body. This will change your relationship with everything. That is the shock.</p>
<p>Once you have turned this corner, if you can turn this corner, then you will be able to face almost anything. And though you may experience shock and dismay in the moment, it will not overtake you. Knowledge will become your foundation, and it is not shocked by the world. It is not even of the world. It is here to serve the world.</p>
<p>At the surface of the mind, you will continue to suffer over things, but they will be things of greater importance and significance, greater meaning and consequence, instead of little things that have no future, no destiny.</p>
<p>Your love will become authentic rather than delusional. It will be aimed at people who can really participate with you rather than those with whom you have no future and destiny.</p>
<p>God is calling you to respond, both within yourself and to the signs of the world. To see the signs, you must be looking and paying attention, not just here and there, but continuously. Like the birds in the air and the animals in the field, you are watching your environment. Just like them, you have a great need to do this.</p>
<p>Everything you value—your future, the people you care about, even your own life—will depend upon this. It is not looking with fear. It is not living in a state of trepidation. It is looking with clear eyes, with the power and the presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>That will make all the difference in whether you can see or not and whether you can look upon the world with dread and anxiety or with certainty, compassion and determination.</p>
<p>Your first commitment and engagement is to Knowledge because that is your commitment and engagement with God. If your engagement is authentic and not filled with your own ambitions and ideas, then you will have a foundation that will enable you to be a source of strength, purpose and reassurance for others. The need for reassurance at this moment is tremendous and is growing with each passing day.</p>
<p>Let the foolish be foolish. Let the ignorant be ignorant. Let the self-deceived be self-deceived. Let those who are lost in their opinions be lost in their opinions. Look for those who can respond. Look for those who can get off the ship. Look for your true allies, for you will need strong companions now. You cannot be circumscribed by the weak minded and those who are too afraid to proceed.</p>
<p>This will change everything for you, as it must change, as it needs to change. It is the blessing of change. It is the difficulty of change. It is what will make you strong and powerful. Do not think it will be easy, for it will not be easy. Do not think it will happen right away because it is a process of many stages and steps. Do not think that you are there already, for you do not know what you will have to face.</p>
<p>The shock of the future is with you now. The wise see before events occur and prepare accordingly. They do not wait to be overtaken in the last moment. They see the signs of the world. They determine the change in the weather, in the atmosphere, in the movement of things and in the response of not only people, but of the creatures of nature. They are watching.</p>
<p>They are not lost in their hobbies or their romances or their obsessions only to be overwhelmed in the last moment. They do not follow the consensus belief. They do not follow what they are told by the leaders of government or religion. They do not follow the general opinions because people are blind and are not paying attention. They are not afraid to face challenge and difficulty, and so they do not pacify themselves with false assumptions. They do not take their cues from the weak and the fearful.</p>
<p>The gift of God is for everyone. The power of Knowledge is for everyone, but who can respond? The gifts of Heaven are for everyone, even living in a difficult and calamitous world, but who can receive them? Who can change their life and perspective to be in a position to experience this?</p>
<p>Even here the shock of the future is a gift—a gift of redemption.</p>
<p>Awaking from one’s own fearful separation is a tremendous event. It calls the powers of Heaven to you, who are beginning to awake.</p>
<p>Let Knowledge be your guide and let the world tell you where it is going and what is emerging on the horizon. Be watchful. Still your mind. Set aside your desires and your constant fear by taking the Steps to Knowledge. Receive the Revelation, the New Message for Humanity. You are blessed to even know of this.</p>
<p>You are blessed to hear Our Voice. You are blessed to be shocked. You are blessed even to be disappointed, for this disappointment can free you from the past. You are blessed to be freed. You are blessed when people leave you. You are blessed when things fall away, for this begins to set the stage for a new life and a greater commitment and relationship with the Divine and with yourself and with others.</p>
<p>This is the world you have come to serve, and nothing but this service will render real meaning and true relationships for you. Understand this, and you will find the secret and the key to greater happiness, a greater meaning and a greater purpose, which are waiting to be discovered.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 2, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>You must listen for the Confirmation.</p>
<p>Our words are not just words.</p>
<p>The writings are not merely ideas.</p>
<p>They are a direct communication to the deepest part of you.</p>
<p>If you cannot hear this, then how will your prayers ever be answered, if you cannot hear the answer?</p>
<p>This is the Confirmation—the Confirmation of why you have come into the world,</p>
<p>The Calling—which will call out of you that which you cannot call out of you yourself,</p>
<p>The resonance that must come from the Source of life, a resonance that you are naturally attached to and in relationship with,</p>
<p>The Confirmation that will bring your life into perspective, finally, giving it the right context, the right meaning and its true application in a changing and difficult world.</p>
<p>The Confirmation is what your heart is seeking in all of your pursuits and relationships, and happiness and fulfillment of whatever kind,</p>
<p>The yearning of the soul for its true engagement in the world.</p>
<p>For you have come here for a greater purpose, a purpose that you cannot ascertain from your intellect, your beliefs or your ideas alone.</p>
<p>It is a personal revelation, and it does not come all at once.</p>
<p>The Confirmation will be when you resonate with the Source of your life and are called into a greater engagement—a true purpose.</p>
<p>So different it is from your plans and goals and schemes for happiness or redemption.</p>
<p>If you are not struggling to survive, as so many people tragically are, then you have an opportunity to respond to a greater relationship and a greater engagement.</p>
<p>And your engagement will play a great part in the restitution of the world and the great relief of poverty and degradation that afflicts so many.</p>
<p>You know not of your greater calling or what it will mean, what it will look like and whom it will serve.</p>
<p>That must be revealed to you over time as you demonstrate a readiness, an honesty and true commitment.</p>
<p>But before this occurs, there is the Calling, there is the sound, there is the Voice, there is the memory, there is the word that snaps you out of your obsessive life, recalling an ancient memory, a deep understanding for a moment.</p>
<p>Like lightning illuminating the landscape at night, it reveals something at the very heart of you.</p>
<p>That is the Confirmation.</p>
<p>The Confirmation is not that the Revelation will meet your expectations and refer to your beliefs or ideas or the beliefs or ideas of your religion or culture, your history or your nation.</p>
<p>These are things for the intellect to dwell upon. But at a deeper level, there is another form of communication that must speak to you and that you in time must speak to others.</p>
<p>A greater engagement, a deeper recollection.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Confirmation will be different from what you thought it would be.</p>
<p>No glory, no grandeur, no accolades.</p>
<p>You will not become a great prince, a great avatar, a great savior.</p>
<p>No. No. No.</p>
<p>Your role will be on a very humble scale, but its gifts will be profound.</p>
<p>You will function without recognition to a large extent, for recognition brings misfortune.</p>
<p>The Confirmation will sound again and again as you take the Steps to Knowledge and journey up this greater mountain—a mountain that you know not of, a mountain that presents itself before you suddenly, as if out of nowhere, from the mystery of your life.</p>
<p>The Confirmation is seeing the world overtaken by the Great Waves of change and the recognition that humanity is not alone in the universe or even within its own world.</p>
<p>Slowly you will see as your eyes are opened, you will hear as your ears are opened, as your mind becomes still and clear and not overwhelmed with its fears, its anger and its obsessions.</p>
<p>This is the Confirmation.</p>
<p>You cannot control it.</p>
<p>You cannot determine the outcome.</p>
<p>You cannot make it be what you want it to be, for this is an engagement with the Source of your life, and the Source sets the terms of engagement.</p>
<p>For you do not come to God on your terms or according to your definitions or requirements.</p>
<p>God does not have to prove the Divine Presence to you.</p>
<p>You have to prove your allegiance to the Presence.</p>
<p>The Confirmation will sound within you, far beneath the surface of your mind, down through the Ancient Corridors of your mind, down through layers of memory, down in a part of you that you know not of, being a stranger to yourself.</p>
<p>Unless you have ventured deeply beneath the surface of your mind, it is unknown what is there.</p>
<p>People are afraid to go there.</p>
<p>People are afraid of themselves—their thoughts, their feelings, their emotions, their fears, their regrets.</p>
<p>But the Confirmation is at a deeper level, you see.</p>
<p>Even the most miserable person can hear it and feel it.</p>
<p>The Confirmation sounds because you have reached a point of readiness, and the world around you is calling for you—calling for you to prepare, for you are not ready for your greater role.</p>
<p>It is a signal from within yourself.</p>
<p>It is a signal from those who watch over your life from above.</p>
<p>It is a signal from the world.</p>
<p>Ready or not, there is the signal—sounding on all these frequencies and all these dimensions, sounding together.</p>
<p>It is the dynamic convergence of what you want, what you know and what the world requires of you.</p>
<p>That is the Confirmation.</p>
<p>But you cannot see it. You cannot touch it. You cannot formulate it in your mind.</p>
<p>You cannot fit it in with your ideas.</p>
<p>You cannot associate it with your beliefs, for it is beyond these things—beyond the realm and the reach of your intellect.</p>
<p>Many pretend to be religious, to espouse their beliefs and ideas, to prostrate themselves at the temple or the mosque or the church.</p>
<p>They speak the words.</p>
<p>They give the appearance.</p>
<p>But the Confirmation has not yet occurred within them.</p>
<p>They are not yet in a deeper engagement.</p>
<p>They are fixed on their beliefs and the social advantages it may give them and the sense of identity it may give them, but the Confirmation has not occurred.</p>
<p>This is happening at a whole other dimension.</p>
<p>Only in the future will your mind finally catch up and say, “Yes, indeed, that was the truth. Yes, indeed, I did need to follow that impulse. Yes, indeed, I did need to respond to the New Revelation. Yes, indeed, I did need to leave that situation.”</p>
<p>It will be obvious to you, for you have reached a better place in life, a place of greater strength, clarity and self-trust.</p>
<p>But before you reach this point of recognition, you are in grave doubt, perhaps having moments of severe doubt and uncertainty, going against your social conditioning, going against your desires and your preferences, following something mysterious that you cannot quantify or justify.</p>
<p>But the Confirmation is pulling you.</p>
<p>Once you have heard it, once you have felt it, your life will never be the same.</p>
<p>It is a great Calling—a calling to prepare, a calling to respond, a calling to begin a process of reclamation and redemption that you cannot control and that you cannot direct.</p>
<p>Your challenge will be to direct your mind and your affairs and to follow the power and the gift of the Confirmation, which will liberate you from that which can only hold you back and compromise your life.</p>
<p>It will liberate you from your false beliefs, your unhealthy associations with others, your dangerous obligations, your anger, your resentment and your unforgiveness.</p>
<p>In time, it will draw you out of all of this, this hopeless jungle that has kept you lost and a stranger to yourself.</p>
<p>Only if you follow the Presence will you know the Presence.</p>
<p>Only if you take the Steps to Knowledge and follow the directives of Knowledge will you understand the power of the deeper intelligence that God has given you.</p>
<p>For it is responding to the Confirmation, as it must.</p>
<p>It has no choice because it is free.</p>
<p>It is free of deception.</p>
<p>It is free of corruption.</p>
<p>It is free of divided purposes.</p>
<p>It is free of confusion.</p>
<p>It is free of seduction.</p>
<p>It is free of fantasy.</p>
<p>It is waiting for the Calling, and once it happens, you will begin to respond, initiating a process deep beneath the surface of the mind.</p>
<p>If you are truly honest, you will follow the deeper movement of your heart and soul.</p>
<p>Even as it draws you away from your beliefs and former investments.</p>
<p>It is a question and matter of honesty.</p>
<p>You cannot know Us, but you must know yourself and the others in your life and those who will be sent to you to help you to regain your true identity and deeper nature.</p>
<p>You cannot abide with Us, for We are beyond the world, and you have been sent to be in the world, to serve the world, to redeem yourself in the world, to reclaim the memory of your Ancient Home while you live here, to experience the Confirmation, to follow the preparation, to allow your life to be reshaped by Knowledge and the mysterious Presence that will visit you from time to time.</p>
<p>You cannot return to God, for God wants you to be in the world.</p>
<p>How can you be in relationship with the Source of all relationships if you cannot even be in relationship with yourself or with another or with a group of people?</p>
<p>It is far beyond your capacity, obviously, to desire such a greater engagement.</p>
<p>You cannot bypass your responsibilities of being in the world and your service to the world.</p>
<p>You cannot leap out of the world into Heaven!</p>
<p>And to try to do so means that you do not understand your real responsibilities here, and you cannot face the challenges of following Knowledge and the Presence in the world.</p>
<p>You can succeed because of the Confirmation.</p>
<p>You can know the truth because of the Confirmation.</p>
<p>You can demonstrate the truth because of the Confirmation.</p>
<p>But along the way, on the long journey itself, you must abide with a deeper presence, a deeper awareness that is only a little light in you at this point.</p>
<p>For it to become a burning fire, you must abide with it, attend to it and keep it in your mind and your heart.</p>
<p>The Revelation is too great to understand.</p>
<p>You can only understand how it can be experienced and expressed in the tangible world.</p>
<p>You cannot even imagine what is beyond the tangible world, for your imagination is only equipped with what your senses have provided you thus far.</p>
<p>It is not imagination that bridges the gap.</p>
<p>It is following a deeper authority that is beyond your control.</p>
<p>You cannot use it to get what you want.</p>
<p>Do not depend upon miracles, for that means you are not utilizing your own strength and power effectively.</p>
<p>It is a miracle that the Confirmation has occurred and will occur again as you proceed, as you become honest, finally, accountable to your deeper nature and your deeper conscience that God has put there.</p>
<p>This is beyond religious belief.</p>
<p>This is beyond the customs and traditions of your faith or your nation or your culture.</p>
<p>You must always distinguish that which is permanent and ineffable from that which you think and believe.</p>
<p>The Confirmation and the power of the Presence will liberate you finally from the reins of belief.</p>
<p>You will finally be let out of that prison even though the door has been open for you all along.</p>
<p>The Greater Truth can only be known.</p>
<p>The New Revelation can only be known.</p>
<p>Its teachings and commentaries can only be known through demonstration and application.</p>
<p>You do not have proof and then you become engaged.</p>
<p>You become engaged and that provides the proof.</p>
<p>You cannot control it, for you are not God. And it is a good thing, for you would only be a cruel and oppressive ruler, as you have been within yourself to such a great extent.</p>
<p>God wills that your true power and abilities be restored to you and that this restoration happen within your engagement with Knowledge deep within yourself and your engagement with others within the world.</p>
<p>If you value your relationship with the Creator, then this is what you must respond to.</p>
<p>Prostrating yourself, worshipping, declaring your submission mean nothing if you will not follow that which you are meant to see, know and do.</p>
<p>The Confirmation will take you to a deeper engagement, a mysterious engagement, an engagement that you must follow even through long periods where you do not experience the Presence and are unsure of the evidence of Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>This is where you begin to change your allegiance within yourself.</p>
<p>No longer governed by ideas and beliefs and the consensus of others, you are now following a deeper Presence and Power, and its demonstration will always produce good.</p>
<p>Even if you have to leave people and disappoint them, it is a movement towards greater freedom for everyone.</p>
<p>The Calling is sounding in the world, for humanity is at a great turning point.</p>
<p>It will determine the outcome and the future, not only for your children, but for your life as well.</p>
<p>It is a time of great activation.</p>
<p>It is a time when the Confirmation must be very strong and many people must respond.</p>
<p>It is not the time for one individual to become the demonstration, for that will never meet the needs of the world.</p>
<p>It is not the time for one great leader or emancipator to come to the world, for that would only further divide humanity, setting it into contention with itself. For not everyone would accept that leader, no matter how pure and righteous they might be.</p>
<p>No, it is now a different era, a more mature period, where humanity has to grow up and become responsible and powerful and cooperative with itself, recognizing the dangers, responding to the needs of the world, recognizing that you are no longer alone and unknown in the universe and that others are here to take advantage of your difficulties and your expectations.</p>
<p>It is a time to become engaged in serving others.</p>
<p>It is a time for the Confirmation to occur.</p>
<p>If you are responding to the New Message and to these words, then the Confirmation is underway, no matter how you respond in the moment.</p>
<p>You can reject and deny Us and the power and grace We bring to you, but We are still here.</p>
<p>And the Calling is still here.</p>
<p>And the Confirmation is still here, waiting for you to respond, waiting for you to become honest and humble, to recognize there are things more important than your ideas, your beliefs or your position in life.</p>
<p>These mean nothing in the face of the Divine.</p>
<p>There is only the Calling, the Response, the Engagement and the Return.</p>
<p>That is all that matters in reality and in the end—the quality of these things, your allegiance to these things and your ability to follow what God has provided now,</p>
<p>In the New Revelation, without the weight of human history and the distortion of human commentary and interpretation and the usage by political forces that have obscured God’s previous Revelations.</p>
<p>They too [the previous Revelations] generated the Confirmation. But you must have a wise teacher to follow them, or you cannot complete your task.</p>
<p>That is why God has sent a New Revelation into the world, for humanity is failing.</p>
<p>Its strength is being lost.</p>
<p>Its opportunities are being diminished.</p>
<p>Its world is in decline.</p>
<p>You are facing intervention from beyond.</p>
<p>How will humanity deal with all of this?</p>
<p>How will it prepare itself?</p>
<p>How will it follow the wise course of action concerning the many decisions that have to be made, not only for nations but for individuals as well?</p>
<p>You cannot answer this.</p>
<p>Your experts cannot answer this.</p>
<p>There is too much confusion.</p>
<p>There is too much deception.</p>
<p>There is too much assumption.</p>
<p>The river is polluted.</p>
<p>The skies are dark.</p>
<p>The environment is contaminated.</p>
<p>How will you see clearly?</p>
<p>How will you navigate the difficult times ahead?</p>
<p>You do not have an answer.</p>
<p>You are afraid to even ask the question.</p>
<p>Look around you.</p>
<p>Everyone is pretending that it is not happening, losing themselves in their hobbies, distractions, their romances, their quest for wealth, their personal problems and so forth, as if nothing is happening in the larger world around them that will affect them directly.</p>
<p>You must listen for the Confirmation.</p>
<p>Our words are not just words.</p>
<p>The writings are not merely ideas.</p>
<p>They are a direct communication to the deepest part of you.</p>
<p>If you cannot hear this, then how will your prayers ever be answered, if you cannot hear the answer?</p>
<p>This is the Confirmation.</p>
<p>It is the power and the grace that will make all the difference, the unseen, the ineffable, that which you cannot quantify, that which you cannot theorize, that which you cannot predict, that which is beyond the reach of science, that which can only confound philosophy, leaving you beyond words and ideas.</p>
<p>That will make all the difference.</p>
<p>What will enable people to choose that which is right and correct and beneficial when there are so many other attractions leading in different directions?</p>
<p>What will enable you to overcome the consensus of others, the wishes of your family, the beliefs of your nation, to follow a Greater Power and a greater purpose?</p>
<p>Our words are not only words.</p>
<p>You must listen beyond the words.</p>
<p>Let your mind be still.</p>
<p>Listen deeply.</p>
<p>Do not come to conclusions.</p>
<p>Do not judge or analyze.</p>
<p>Listen deeply.</p>
<p>Contemplate.</p>
<p>Live with the question.</p>
<p>Do not provide the answers.</p>
<p>Be still.</p>
<p>Be open.</p>
<p>Be discerning.</p>
<p>The Confirmation is waiting for you and for others.</p>
<p>You cannot control their response but only your own.</p>
<p>What voice will you follow?</p>
<p>What voice will you listen to?</p>
<p>With so many attractions and seductions and persuasions within you and around you and throughout the world, how can you follow the True Voice?</p>
<p>This is a question that only God can answer and has answered and is answering through these words and through the words and the sounds and the presence of the Revelation.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on February 12, 2009<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p><em>Here the new God is the old God, unveiled and clarified.</em></p>
<p>There is a New Revelation about God, a Revelation that takes God out of the ancient history of humanity, out of the conflicts and the fantasies and the misunderstandings of humanity. This Revelation takes God into the larger panorama of life in the universe called the Greater Community.</p>
<p>You need this new understanding of God now because the God of the ancients was a small God—a God of your world and of your time, a God of your cultures, a God of your peoples in ancient time. But humanity has outgrown this God, this human God, this angry God, this vengeful God, this God that seems to be a projection of your personality and tendencies.</p>
<p>It is not that the ancients were wrong. It is just that their comprehension was limited. It is not that they created a God in their own likeness; it is just that they could not comprehend a God that was beyond their likeness.</p>
<p>The New Revelation presents God within a greater context, within the context of intelligent life in the universe. This is not a human context, for it is not a human universe that you are facing.</p>
<p>It is not a God that is preoccupied with this one world alone. It is not a God that judges the way that you would judge or condemns the way that you would condemn. It is not a God that needs praise and worship, that must have obedience and adulation. That is the old God of the tribe. That is the old God that favors one nation over another, one people over another. That is an old idea of God.</p>
<p>But God has never been like this you see. For the God that people have looked to and have worshipped, the God that people have apprehended and misapprehended, has always been the God of the Greater Community—the vast expanses of space, other dimensions of reality and countless races of beings, so different from the human family.</p>
<p>This is the one God of the universe. Not a God of one world, one people or one tribe. Not a God that thinks, acts or behaves the way that human beings think, act and behave. This God is not limited to one Revelation for humanity, for there have been successive Revelations for humanity.</p>
<p>Now there is a New Revelation for humanity to prepare the human family for the great change that is coming to the world and to prepare humanity for its future, destiny and encounter with the Greater Community of intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>It will not be possible for you to think of God in the old ways if you want to understand God’s New Revelation for the world. You will not be able to understand the reality and the significance of intelligent life in the universe if you think of God in old ways. For the old God was exclusive to humanity—a God of one nation, a God of one people, a God of one’s race, a God of one world alone. That is why the old God was too limited and too much discerned in the likeness of humanity alone [for people] to comprehend God’s real nature and purpose, even here in this world.</p>
<p>The old God took people to war. The old God seemed to have no concern for the welfare of people and nations that God did not favor. The old God was used by kings, monarchs and nations to justify and to amplify their nation’s grievances and ambitions. The old God seemed to delight in punishing humanity for the inevitable errors that humanity would make in its separated state living in this world. The whole notion of Heaven and Hell is built around the belief and the assumptions about the old God.</p>
<p>The new God, the God of the Greater Community, the God of a greater reality than your own requires a redefinition of all of these things. For God’s reality is so very different than how God has been considered and believed in, in the past.</p>
<p>God does not favor one nation over another. God does not lead peoples to war. God does not will one nation’s victory over another nation or one people’s conquest of another people. God does not will for natural disasters, plagues, illness or catastrophes.</p>
<p>You can blame these things on the old God, but not on the new God. For God has set into motion the forces of nature, evolution, and geologic change since the beginning of time, and that is all running itself now.</p>
<p>God is intelligent. God does not have to run every little thing. God does not have to move the blood through your veins or operate your millions of cells. God does not have to run the weather of the world. God does not have to run the nations of the world or the economies of the world. It is all set in motion. It was set in motion at the beginning of time.</p>
<p>God watches over the world and all worlds, calling to the separated to return, calling through the avenues of religion, calling through the avenue of conscience, calling through the avenue of true love and recognition.</p>
<p>The God of the universe does not care what your religious beliefs are so long as they can assist you in bringing you to the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you—a deeper intelligence that God has placed within you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to a greater service and contribution in the world.</p>
<p>The old God was dominated by religious institutions. If you did not support those institutions and believe in their ideology, it was considered you would be sent to Hell, that you were affronting God.</p>
<p>God does not care about these things. The beliefs and fascinations, obsessions and fantasies of humanity are not what move God. It is the deeper movement of the heart and the conscience. It is the act of selfless giving. It is the act of forgiveness and the desire to contribute beyond one’s own personal needs and preferences. It is the recognition of one to another. It is an enemy becoming a friend. It is the healing of the natural world that has been despoiled. These are the things that move the Lord of the universe.</p>
<p>If you are to understand humanity’s destiny and future within a Greater Community of life in the universe, if you are to understand how to prepare for the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, then you must have a new experience and understanding of the Divine.</p>
<p>If you cling to the old ideas and the old definitions, you will not understand what humanity is facing and how to prepare. You will think it is the end of time. You will think it is the great punishment. You will think it is the final battle—all these kinds of things that seem to indicate a grand finale to the human experience.</p>
<p>Humanity is but leaving one stage of its development and entering another. It is a great transition from a world of tribal societies and warring factions to a more united and powerful humanity—a humanity that can live, function and remain free within a Greater Community of life, a humanity that can face Intervention from other races in the universe and can establish its own rules of engagement here, a united humanity that can learn to live within the boundaries and limited resources of this world without driving them into oblivion and decline.</p>
<p>A united humanity will need a new experience and understanding of the Divine if it is to make this great transition and to avoid the ever-growing temptation towards conflict, competition and war. Facing a world of declining resources, a world of environmental destruction, a world of violent weather and growing economic instability, you will need to have a greater experience of the Divine and particularly of the power of Knowledge within yourself. It is at this deeper level beneath the surface of your intellect, that God will touch you and move you by the very force of attraction of the Divine.</p>
<p>You cannot comprehend God with your intellect. You cannot reduce God down into a rational principle. You must see that God is not operating all the functions of the world, for these were set in motion at the beginning of time.</p>
<p>There is no conflict here between creation and evolution. There is really no conflict between religion and science. They are all born out of the same reality, the same need to comprehend life, the same need to correct human error and to establish a safe and secure future for the human family.</p>
<p>Religion and science are corrupted by the same forces—the desire for individual power, the domination of one group over another, institutions fighting for supremacy. They are both orthodox in their own right, and both tend to be limited and self-defensive.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to connect the past with the present and the future, it is best to let the past go, to see that humanity’s understanding of the Divine is an evolutionary process in and of itself. If you try to connect the future with the past, you will either deny the future or you will have to change your understanding of the past.</p>
<p>Ancient prophecies will not be fulfilled. The Messiah will not return to the world. It is now the time for Knowledge to emerge. It is the era of human cooperation and human responsibility.</p>
<p>No one great leader is going to come and lead humanity into a glorious future. No one individual is going to come and settle all the scores and take revenge upon the wicked. That is the old idea of God. It is no longer relevant, and it was never really true to begin with. It is the desire of people for a final resolution to the conundrums of life, to the questions of life and to the problems of life.</p>
<p>You were sent into the world to make a contribution here, a specific contribution concerning certain people in certain situations. Do not think that you understand these yet. Do not yet assume that you are fully involved in these yet.</p>
<p>Do not think that by believing in a religious ideology that you are going to be saved. For if you do not do what you came here to do, if you do not engage with those who you are meant to engage with and to contribute your gifts, belief alone will not bridge the gap and end the separation between you and God.</p>
<p>To reunite with God, you have to become more like what God really created in you. God has placed Knowledge within you to guide you and to redeem you. Beliefs are secondary and often stand in the way of this redemption.</p>
<p>Thinking that your religion is the one true religion will stand in the way of your redemption. Condemning other nations, peoples and religions will prevent you from receiving this redemption. Being self-righteous and the defender of your faith will blind you and you will turn your back to God. You must have the courage and the faith in the Divine to think of God anew, to realize your responsibilities here and to recognize that you were sent into the world to be a contributor, not a judge or a critic.</p>
<p>Here you must realize that God has initiated all the world’s religions, and they have all been changed by people, even radically changed. To correct the errors of the past, to renew the true faith, and to bring forth the great truth of the ancient religions in their pure form, God has sent a New Revelation into the world, not to replace the religions of the world, but to clarify them and to give them new strength and power and a greater unity with one another.</p>
<p>It is not just a correction, however. It is a preparation for a future that will be unlike the past. You are facing a non-human universe. You are facing environmental destruction and ever-growing instability and insecurity in the world. You are facing a world of declining resources, a world where an ever-growing population will have to drink from a slowly shrinking well.</p>
<p>You may pray to God to save you, but God has sent you here to save the world, to play your small but essential part in this.</p>
<p>It is not the end of time. It is a great transition. It is not the end of the world. It is a great reckoning and a new time of Revelation. Many things will come to an end. Many ways of life will have to be altered. Human understanding will have to change. Human responsibility will have to grow. Human compassion will have to grow. Human forgiveness will have to grow. It will seem like the end of time, like the whole world is coming down on you, a time of cataclysmic change and upheaval. But it is really a time for humanity to grow up, to become wise and to prepare for its future.</p>
<p>Only God knows what is coming over the horizon, and only God can prepare you for this completely. You may recognize certain solutions to aspects of the world’s problems, but you cannot prepare yourself for the Great Waves of change or for your encounter with intelligent life in the universe.</p>
<p>God has sent a New Revelation into the world to prepare humanity for its future, to warn humanity of the great dangers within the world and beyond the world and to bless humanity with the power and the presence of Knowledge that has been placed as a deeper strength within each person so that humanity will choose peace over war, cooperation over division, resolution over the loss of confidence, freedom over capitulation and responsibility over weakness. This is not the providence of a few inspired individuals or a few small groups working to support the human family. It will have to be something that will have to reach far and wide.</p>
<p>Not everyone will have to receive and believe in the New Message from God, but it must reach enough people to have its impact here, to provide a new awareness and experience of the Divine in your life and the deeper movement of your life.</p>
<p>Here you will have to let go of your notions of Heaven and Hell and your belief in a final judgment day and all of these things, for they will not fit with the greater reality that you are entering.</p>
<p>If you follow Knowledge, you will become closer to God. If you deny Knowledge and follow your fears and ambitions, you will become further away from God. If you contribute your gifts in the world, you will not need to come here again. You will have completed this cycle of your evolution and development.</p>
<p>God is not going to just bring you back to Heaven. God is going to put you to work in the universe, in the reality of the separated. You have many present tasks and many future tasks. You do not run away from this into Heaven, for there is much work to do, you see. God does not waste this opportunity. Your redemption must be a source of inspiration for others and must continue to have a resonating and positive effect on life in the universe.</p>
<p>No one will be sent to Hell, but people are already living in Hell, being separated from God—the Hell of their own fearful imagination, the Hell of their self-hatred and hatred of others, the Hell of their circumstances, the Hell of their isolation. Yes, there are worse Hells than this, but God will not send you there.</p>
<p>If you are left out of God’s grace and power, God’s providence and God’s guidance, then your Hell will deepen and can seem to be endless. But it is not endless, for God has placed Knowledge within you, and eventually you will come to realize that you must follow this Knowledge, you must accept this Knowledge and that only Knowledge can take you from the Hell of your separation, from your isolation and from your own grievances and self-denial.</p>
<p>In the end, God will win everyone back, even the most wicked. They will just have to work longer to redeem themselves. They will have to give more to counteract their harmful impacts upon others. Here kings will have to be water carriers and till the fields. Here tyrants will have to sweep the streets.</p>
<p>People are impatient. They want a judgment day. They want everything to be finished. They do not want to have to live with great questions, great unresolved questions. They want God to punish others that they themselves cannot or will not punish. They think they know what justice is.</p>
<p>That is why the old God is filled with revenge and anger and repudiation that people are forced to believe in with the threat of death and Hell. That is a primitive way of looking at life. It is an ignorant way of looking at life. It does not account for the reality of the Divine or the reality of your Divine nature and destiny.</p>
<p>God will call everyone back eventually, but eventually could be a long time from now. In the interim, you suffer; you live in darkness and confusion. You do not realize your power, your value or the greater strength of Knowledge within you. It (Knowledge) is waiting to be discovered, and it is trying to save you even at this moment.</p>
<p>If humanity is to escape great collapse in the future, if you are to escape domination by other races in the universe, you must now listen and gain a new and greater understanding of the Divine presence and power in your life, the real nature of human destiny and what will be required of peoples, groups and nations to choose wisely in the face of a changing world.</p>
<p>Here your old beliefs are clarified and purified. Here you do not abandon the great traditions. Instead, you see their connection with one another and the great value and wisdom that is at the very heart of their teachings.</p>
<p>Yet your cosmology will change because you are entering the Greater Community. Your religion now cannot be a religion of one world alone or one people alone. It will have to be a Greater Community religion—a God of the universe, a spirituality of the universe, that which unites you and connects you with one another despite your differing views and interpretations.</p>
<p>Fight against this and you fight against God’s will and purpose for humanity. Repudiate this and you repudiate your future, your evolution and the primary education you must receive at this time. Lash out against God’s New Revelation and you will further distance yourself from the power and presence of God in your life. They are all connected, these Revelations, but you must see their pure thread and content to understand this.</p>
<p>Much of what people believe in is purely a human creation—the stories, the miracles, the tradition of stories and miracles—a human creation. That God created the world in a few days—a human creation, the attempt by a limited understanding to comprehend the reality and the mystery of Creation. It is like asking a five-year-old to talk about the evolution of the world. They can only do it in such simple language, simple stories and a simple timeframe. They cannot yet comprehend the expanse, the immensity and complexity of what they are looking at.</p>
<p>As you expand your awareness and your understanding, you gain a greater comprehension of the Divine, the miracle of Creation and the even greater miracle of redemption.</p>
<p>Here the new God is the old God, unveiled and clarified, not closed in ancient understandings or ancient mythologies. For there is only one God and that is God of all the universes and God of all the races. God has a Plan of redemption for each one, and each one is reclaimed through Knowledge, for God has put Knowledge in each one.</p>
<p>Most races in the universe are far less free than humanity is at this time. Many races are suffering under subjugation by other races or have become entirely secular and technological in their emphasis. Yet there is still a Plan of redemption for them all. But can you say what this is? Of course not. Can you define God’s Will and Plan for the universe? Of course not. Can you even comprehend a Greater Community of intelligent life—a billion, billion, billion races, and many more beyond this?</p>
<p>Here instead of trying to make life fit into your ideology, to make everything squeeze into your limited understanding, you begin to follow the power and the presence of Knowledge within you. This reveals God’s Presence and Plan for your life, and you realize that beyond the intellect, there is a greater dimension to your existence and that the intellect must serve this.</p>
<p>Here you cease to proclaim that you know God’s Will, and you become humble, and you allow God’s Will for you and for this time to be revealed. If your intention is pure, you will follow something without coming to great conclusions, without proclaiming yourself and without formulating a new ideology that is really a human creation.</p>
<p>Knowledge knows where you are going. Knowledge knows what is coming over the horizon. Knowledge is trying to protect and prepare you even at this moment. But you are not yet aware of the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself sufficiently to hear its messages, to heed its warnings and to receive its guidance. That is why God’s New Revelation provides the Steps to Knowledge, so that you can gain access to this deeper reality and this deeper current of your life.</p>
<p>Humanity cannot save itself now. It cannot come up with one solution for the Great Waves of change. It does not know how to prepare itself for a universe of intelligent life—a competitive environment on a scale you cannot even imagine. That is why there is a New Message from God in the world, to provide the Revelation, to provide the warning, to provide the encouragement and to provide the preparation.</p>
<p>Here you must become a person who can function in the Greater Community, a person who can think in terms of the whole world, a person who is not limited and constrained by a previous understanding that is far too limited and insufficient to enable you to perceive your changing circumstances and the great challenges that are coming.</p>
<p>Here the New Revelation opens doors, expands your awareness and perception, liberates you from old ideas that would never allow you to see the present and the future, frees you from condemnation and brings back to you the mystery and the power of your life and greater purpose in the world.</p>
<p>God has a greater Plan for the human family, but this Plan can only be followed individually through Knowledge, through cooperation and recognition between peoples, through environmental responsibility, through accountability to the human family and through humility and simplicity—without arrogance, without condemnation and without self-righteousness.</p>
<p>These are all a human invention, and they are not limited to humanity alone. Such tendencies exist throughout the universe. It is the result of separation, the great separation from God that set in motion the creation and the expansion of the physical universe.</p>
<p>The physical universe is but a small part of God’s Creation. But this remains for you to learn, and you have a greater journey and a destiny here. But you have to allow your mind to expand, your eyes to open and your ears to hear if you are to gain this greater preparation and understanding.</p>
<p>The old religions, if they are held in contempt of one another, have really become obsolete and will become increasingly so in the future. Now you must see Jesus within the Greater Community and Mohammad and the Buddha and all the great saints and emissaries in a larger context, in a greater series of Revelations—each bringing humanity closer to world civilization and to greater cooperation and a deeper experience of the conscience that God has placed within you. In this sense, all religions are ecumenical. They are all meant to support one another instead of compete and denounce one another.</p>
<p>Gods Will is for humanity to unite, to preserve the world and to prepare for its future in the Greater Community—a future where humanity’s freedom will be challenged repeatedly, a future where humanity will be seduced by the offers of alien technology, a future with many hazards, but a future where humanity must maintain human freedom and sovereignty within this world. Lose this and you lose everything—all the accomplishments of humanity.</p>
<p>Only God’s New Revelation can show you these things, for they were not part of God’s previous Revelations. Humanity did not need to know of the Greater Community, and humanity was not facing a world in decline in previous eras. But now you are facing these things, and you must prepare, and that is why an emissary was sent into the world bringing a New Message from God. He is not a savior. He is not magnificent. He is simple and humble. He is the Messenger.</p>
<p>Once again, humanity is challenged with a New Revelation. Can it receive this? Can it comprehend this? Can it accept this, or will it fight and struggle and denounce and continue its violent and ignorant ways? Will the human intellect still try to replace the power of Knowledge within the individual? Will religion grow and expand, or will it contract and become self-defensive? Will people be able to change, to have a real change of heart to prepare them for the future and to assure them a greater life and a greater security in the world? These are questions that only people can answer.</p>
<p>The Revelation is upon you because the great needs are upon you. God has more to say to the human family and has provided a New Revelation and a new way forward. This has come from the new God—new only to your understanding, for there is only one God and that God is neither new nor old, but has always been. It is humanity’s understanding that must evolve now and a New Revelation has been given to make this possible.</p>
<p>The Revelation was given in the face of great necessity, for humanity is not recognizing the Great Waves of change and is not responding to the presence of forces from the Greater Community who are in the world to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity.</p>
<p>Humanity is not responding and cannot prepare itself in time and that is why the Revelation has been given. It is also being given to uplift humanity’s understanding of its spiritual nature and reality to the level of Knowledge, where there are no conflicts and contentiousness between people. For Knowledge cannot be in opposition to itself. Your greater spiritual reality and identity were created in harmony with all others. It is only the arrogance of human presumption and the overriding presence of fear and competition that drive people away from their true nature and purpose here.</p>
<p>Be of good cheer for a great Message is being sent into the world from the Creator of all life in the universe. Have great confidence that the power and presence of Knowledge is within you, and as you learn to take the Steps to Knowledge, you will find its power, grace and guidance for yourself and for others. You will see that you truly were created by God and sent into the world for a greater purpose and that you have a greater destiny beyond this world and a greater future within and beyond the boundaries of time.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 23, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>You will see in the face of the Revelation who is available<br />
to the Power and the Presence of God.</p>
<p>Recognition must be based upon a deeper experience, recognition of a greater truth, recognition of a New Revelation.</p>
<p>This recognition occurs at a deeper level of the mind, beyond the realm of the intellect, beyond the realm of ideas and beliefs and the things that people attach themselves to regarding the Divine Presence and Power in the world.</p>
<p>This Power is so formidable, but it functions through the individual. It works from the inside out. This is how God works in the world.</p>
<p>People want grandiose demonstrations, but the Presence operates differently. It does not make a great show of itself. It speaks to the inner world of the person and reaches from person to person in this way.</p>
<p>Here the experience of recognition is not based upon the fervency of one’s belief, for people are forever arguing over beliefs and can never really unite at this level.</p>
<p>The resonance is happening beyond ideas and formulations of ideas. This is where true commitment emerges. This is where real courage emerges. This is where compassion and the experience of Grace emerge.</p>
<p>God’s Power and Presence in the world are demonstrated through selfless actions, through recognition of one person to another, through selfless giving and the commitment to give, the commitment to serve, the commitment to contribute—beyond one’s own edification, and certainly beyond one’s own enrichment.</p>
<p>Where does this incentive come from? What is the nature of true goodness?</p>
<p>It all comes from the Mystery, the Power and Presence of God in the world.</p>
<p>People want demonstrations. They want miracles because they are not having the experience. This is all the striving of the mind—the surface mind, the worldly mind.</p>
<p>“Prove to me that God is real! Give me a miracle! Give me what I want! Solve my problems!”</p>
<p>People think like this because they are not having the true experience, and if they have had the true experience, they are not being patient. They are not recognizing that the encounter with God is intermittent and not continuous. For it is not allowed for you to have too much experience of the Divine or you will never be willing to stay in the world and provide your service here.</p>
<p>You cannot run away to God, for you were sent into the world to serve a world in need.</p>
<p>That is why the Presence is not a form of intoxication. It is not a grand escape. It is not ascending far beyond, never to return.</p>
<p>Why would God call you back to Heaven when great effort was made to bring you into the world?</p>
<p>People want many things, but if they are not having the deeper experience, then they are only dealing with their ideas.</p>
<p>They are debating their ideas.</p>
<p>They are arguing over their ideas.</p>
<p>They are trying to understand the ineffable with their ideas!</p>
<p>They are trying to comprehend with their ideas!</p>
<p>That is like asking your hand to understand your mind.</p>
<p>That is like asking a child to understand the world.</p>
<p>The Power and Presence of God in the world is far beyond human estimation and human evaluation.</p>
<p>True faith and true adherence comes from a deeper place, from the very soul, the very heart of you, the center of your Being.</p>
<p>Here you are not separated from the Creator. But you are separated from your deeper nature, and it is to bridge this gap, to take The Steps to Knowledge that represents the focus of all true spiritual practice and religious endeavor.</p>
<p>People want many things, but most of all they need the deeper experience, the true connection, for this meets the need of the soul and begins to re-establish true integrity and balance within yourself.</p>
<p>The work of God is everywhere, but who can see it?</p>
<p>People are obsessing over human error and human tragedy, constantly complaining about the world and venting their anger and frustration upon others.</p>
<p>God is with them, but they are looking in another direction.</p>
<p>The Presence is here, but people are too busy doing other things to recognize it and to respond to it.</p>
<p>God is giving you what you need, not what you want.</p>
<p>It is not enough simply to try to satisfy your basic desires, however essential they may be. The connection must happen at a deeper level.</p>
<p>If you are hungry and starving, well then you must meet that need, and that will predominate. But even here, the Presence is available.</p>
<p>In fact, under these more dire circumstances, you may seek it with greater fervency and adhere to it with a greater dedication.</p>
<p>Here the poor are often more rich in spirit than the rich themselves, who have a great competing agenda differing from their primary purpose and function of being in the world.</p>
<p>God’s Power and Presence in the world are so strong that they can arouse a dedication, a commitment and an integrity far greater than anything else could possibly evoke.</p>
<p>This can transform a person’s life, elevating them to a greater level of service and clarity, making them a true light shining in a darkening world.</p>
<p>The power of force, the power of wealth, the attractions of beauty and charm ultimately cannot compete or compare with this.</p>
<p>People think they understand the Will of the Creator, but unless they are connected to the deeper Knowledge and intelligence that God has placed within them, then they are just following their ideas.</p>
<p>People are killing each other over their ideas.</p>
<p>People are demonstrating cruelty over their ideas.</p>
<p>This is not where you engage with the Divine.</p>
<p>Your ideas will fall into place once you are having a deeper experience, but you must allow the definitions to be open, for once you begin to make contact with the power of Knowledge within yourself that God has placed there to direct you and protect you, then your life will begin a process of reformation.</p>
<p>And how can you possibly make conclusions and sweeping ideas when your life is undergoing a fundamental reformation? If you are true, you will stand aside and allow this to occur instead of trying to control it for your own benefit or to fortify and substantiate your beliefs and preferences.</p>
<p>God has spoken again.</p>
<p>The Messenger is in the world.</p>
<p>It is a great test for humanity as to who can see and who can respond.</p>
<p>Here you will see what is really important. It will not be intellectual brilliance. It will not be eloquence or beauty or charm or the force of personality, for people who possess these things may be the last to see and the last to know.</p>
<p>They are dressed up in the obsessions of the world, and these things will not enable them to see. It happens at a deeper level.</p>
<p>This is the great test. This is where you see at the time of Revelation who can respond and the nature of their response and the purity and clarity of their response.</p>
<p>In the light of the Creator, all deception is revealed and demonstrated. People’s true intentions become evident.</p>
<p>It is like the lightning flash on the darkened landscape. For a moment, everything is revealed.</p>
<p>You will see in the face of the Revelation who is available to the Power and the Presence of God.</p>
<p>Who can respond?</p>
<p>Who has the humility, who has the courage to reassess their former ideas and beliefs?</p>
<p>Who is willing to undergo the process of reformation that is necessary to take them to a greater and more honest and complete experience of life and expression of purpose?</p>
<p>People will judge the New Message, but the New Message is revealing their intentions.</p>
<p>It is saying everything about them.</p>
<p>Their success or failure in responding says everything about them and the degree to which they have come to terms with their own suffering, the limits of their ideas, their inability to discern their true direction in life, the weakness of their beliefs and the degree to which they have compromised themselves to gain advantage and approval with others.</p>
<p>If God speaks again, who can respond?</p>
<p>If God shows things that have never been shown before, who is willing to see this?</p>
<p>If God defies religious belief and expectations, who has the courage and the humility to be prepared to receive this?</p>
<p>If God calls you to a higher service and position in life, who is willing to undergo this process of change, a process they cannot control and cannot even really understand?</p>
<p>Who is willing and able to do this?</p>
<p>This is the true test of readiness and integrity, honesty and openness.</p>
<p>The New Message is entirely honest, and it asks you to be entirely honest—a level of honesty that most people do not even consider.</p>
<p>Being true to Oneself, being responsive to one’s deeper nature, to look beyond one’s fears and beliefs and preferences, to listen for a greater voice, for the power of Knowledge that God has placed within you.</p>
<p>Knowledge will respond, of course, because it is responding to its Source.</p>
<p>Not everyone is ready to receive the New Revelation. God knows this and there is no condemnation here.</p>
<p>But it is the falsity of people’s position and assumptions about themselves that will be revealed in this process.</p>
<p>Those who have intellectual pride, those who think they are intelligent and clever, those who think they can discern everything, those who think they know the truth, those who think they know what honesty is—this is the hypocrisy that will be revealed in the light of God’s Power and Presence in the world.</p>
<p>At every great time of Revelation, spread out intermittently over the course of human history, how many have failed to recognize the significance of the event that was taking place in their lives, at their time?</p>
<p>And if they had the great opportunity to witness or to recognize the Messenger of that time and era, did they just see another person or did they recognize the power of the Messenger and the Grace that accompanies the Messenger?</p>
<p>People want the Messenger to be a super person—powerful, magnificent, immaculate, utterly pure, well behaved, in accordance with human expectation. But the Messenger is a human being and is always fallible, but it is the Message and the Presence that accompany the Messenger that makes all the difference.</p>
<p>Jesus made mistakes. Mohammed made mistakes. The Buddha made mistakes. All the great leaders that followed them, and all the great teachers in other traditions, they all made mistakes.</p>
<p>To live in Separation is to make mistakes.</p>
<p>To enter a world of Separation means you will make mistakes.</p>
<p>But if the Messengers deliver the Message and do not elevate themselves into a godlike position, then they have achieved their goal.</p>
<p>The test is before you now.</p>
<p>The New Revelation is before you.</p>
<p>It has crossed your path.</p>
<p>What are you going to do with it?</p>
<p>How are you going to respond?</p>
<p>What are you going to do?</p>
<p>The greatest event of your life—are you going to be present for this? Or is this just another event amongst other events to which you cannot really respond?</p>
<p>It is a challenge.</p>
<p>It is a fair challenge.</p>
<p>It is an honest challenge.</p>
<p>And it is more than a challenge.</p>
<p>It is a gift and a calling and an opportunity for you.</p>
<p>The challenge is just part of the engagement.</p>
<p>It is not that God is taking pleasure in challenging you. It is just part of the opportunity to engage with the Source of your life, as it presents itself in a pure and uncorrupted form.</p>
<p>And how will you see the Messenger?</p>
<p>Can you feel this?</p>
<p>Can you be still?</p>
<p>Can you set aside reactions and judgments and take the time, however long that requires, to consider this individual and the great burden he carries and the great challenge before him?</p>
<p>That is a fair question.</p>
<p>It is a great opportunity for you and for others.</p>
<p>And if you are truly honest with yourself, you would at least say, “Well, I do not know, and I am not sure”—if you are not sure.</p>
<p>At this time of Revelation, God’s Power and Presence reasserts itself in the world—a New Revelation revealing the great change that is coming to the world and humanity’s destiny in a Greater Community of life in the universe and the great challenges that will require and place upon the entire human family.</p>
<p>People will debate this.</p>
<p>They will contend with this.</p>
<p>They will argue against this.</p>
<p>They will deny this.</p>
<p>But it is all a failure to respond.</p>
<p>They are trying to respond, but they are not using the proper facilities and faculties of mind to do this.</p>
<p>They are being impacted, but they are still lost in their ideas and the machinations of the mind when the engagement is happening at a whole other level.</p>
<p>If you cannot engage with God, how are you going to really engage with anyone else?</p>
<p>If you cannot experience affinity with the Power and the Presence of God, how are you going to experience affinity with anyone else?</p>
<p>You may become intoxicated, falling in love temporarily with someone.</p>
<p>You may be delighted with another’s presence, but will you be able to experience true affinity with them?</p>
<p>If you do not trust God, how will you trust anyone else?</p>
<p>If you are not humbled before God, how can you be humbled before anyone else?</p>
<p>That is why the New Message has been brought to the people and not to the leaders, who have elevated themselves and concealed themselves and fortified themselves and isolated themselves.</p>
<p>They are circumscribed by how they have created their position in life. It will be more difficult for them even though the New Message is for them as well.</p>
<p>Stand in judgment of the New Message and you will not see. You will not hear. And you will not know. You will be deaf and blind and arrogant all at once.</p>
<p>And the Heavenly Host will shake their heads.</p>
<p>“It is so unfortunate. That person could not respond. They could do so much for the world! They are lost in their idea of themselves. They cannot see beyond their previous investment and their position and their accomplishments and acquisitions.”</p>
<p>God is seeking to empower the human family through the New Revelation, to empower the individual, who is the source of freedom in the world, to give people greater vision, clarity and responsibility. This is the source of human progress in the world.</p>
<p>It is not that you will be given a grand new theology to argue about and to debate and to comment on forever and ever.</p>
<p>You are being prepared for a new world and for the rigors and the dangers of entering into the Greater Community itself.</p>
<p>You are being prepared for the challenges of great change coming to the world, greater than you can yet realize or anticipate.</p>
<p>You are being prepared for a greater life, with greater strength and integrity, but you must submit and receive and learn to become truly honest with yourself about your deeper intentions and your greater responsibilities in being here.</p>
<p>The Power and the Presence of God will remind you of these things and will call you out of your former understanding, your former predicaments, your unsolvable problems, your compromised position, your weakness regarding your relationship with others.</p>
<p>It will call you forth, for it is the Power and the Presence of God in the world.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 22, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>God is moving humanity in a new direction, a direction it has not had to move in before. For the world has changed, and humanity is facing a Greater Community of life in the universe—a great change, a great threshold in humanity’s long evolution, a time of immense upheaval and uncertainty, a dangerous time for the human family, a time that will be moving quickly with events unfolding quickly.</p>
<p>God is moving humanity in a new direction, towards a world community that is able to sustain the world and that is able to encounter the realities of life in the universe, which will be thrust upon you and are being thrust upon you even at this moment.</p>
<p>It is a great change that many people feel but do not comprehend. The movement of the world is accelerating, where people’s lives will be overwhelmed and overtaken by the great environmental change that is taking place and through political and economic upheaval.</p>
<p>All of this is now in motion and cannot be stopped, only mitigated. This will require a great adaptation.</p>
<p>It is at this great threshold in humanity’s history that a New Revelation has been sent into the world, and a Messenger has been sent here to receive it, to prepare it and to present it. For him, it is a long journey, a long and difficult journey.</p>
<p>The Message for humanity now is great, more comprehensive and complete than any Message that has ever been sent into the world, complete with teaching and commentary so that its wisdom and Knowledge can be discerned and applied correctly and not simply left up to human interpretation.</p>
<p>People do not see, they do not hear. They are strangers to themselves. And their native skills of discerning the environment, for many, have been lost and are undeveloped.</p>
<p>This makes the Messenger’s task more difficult. He must carry the Mystery, for the Revelation is beyond the realm of the intellect and certainly is not conditioned by people’s expectations, beliefs or comprehension.</p>
<p>God is moving the world in a new direction. It is a direction that was always intended, but it will be new for the people of the world. It will be new to your understanding.</p>
<p>The Great Revelations from the Creator are always like this. They are always presenting a new reality, a new awareness, a new dimension and a greater promise.</p>
<p>The world is growing dark, and this greater promise is needed now. Only the light of Knowledge, the greater intelligence that the Creator has bestowed upon the human family and upon all the races in the universe, only this now can enable you to comprehend and respond.</p>
<p>For you return to God on God’s terms, God’s Messages must be comprehended, as they truly are and are intended to be.</p>
<p>There will be much struggle and contention with this, and the Messenger and the Messenger’s followers must face this difficulty, this frustration and exercise great patience.</p>
<p>Such a Revelation will not be accepted at the outset, and only the few will be able to respond completely. But as time moves forward and as the world grows more turbulent, the New Message will gain a greater attraction, greater recognition and greater relevance.</p>
<p>It is answering questions you have not even asked. It is a preparation for the future as well as a remedy for the present.</p>
<p>Your philosophers and theologians will not know what to make of it. They will have issues with it. It will not conform to their understanding, to which they have invested themselves so greatly.</p>
<p>Religious leaders will contend against it because it speaks of a reality that they do not yet recognize.</p>
<p>God is moving humanity in a new direction.</p>
<p>The Messenger is here to provide the Revelation. It has taken him decades to receive it. It will take decades for it to be recognized in the world.</p>
<p>But the problem is time. Humanity does not have much time to prepare for a new world and for Contact with life in the universe—Contact which is occurring already, Contact with a dangerous purpose and intention.</p>
<p>People are obsessed with their needs, their issues, their longing and their desires. They do not see the movement of the world.</p>
<p>For the world has changed, but people have not changed with it. And now you are facing a new set of realities.</p>
<p>What will God say to this as people feel overwhelmed, as their prophecies for the future do not come true, as the return of their savior does not occur, as they believe that God is creating all these problems for them?</p>
<p>The Revelation speaks to all these things, but you must be open to the Revelation, and you must face the prospect of great change, for it is upon you and the world, and it is going to move forward.</p>
<p>You cannot go backwards thousands of years and try to comprehend what is occurring today, for humanity’s evolution has moved into a new position, a position of dominance in the world and a position of greater vulnerability in the universe.</p>
<p>Where will this education begin to prepare you for a new world and for the Greater Community of life—two events that will alter the course of human history and affect the life of every person?</p>
<p>The governments do not know. The religious leaders do not know. The experts do not know. The universities cannot prepare people.</p>
<p>The Revelation must come from the Creator of all life, and this is what is occurring now, for you are living in a time of Revelation, and the Messenger is in the world.</p>
<p>As long as he is in the world, you have an opportunity to receive and to prepare.</p>
<p>When he is gone, it will be different. It will be more difficult.</p>
<p>In this, he is the Light in the world.</p>
<p>He is a humble man and makes no claims other than to be the Messenger, for that is the role that has been assigned to him.</p>
<p>He must prepare humanity for a new world through the Revelation.</p>
<p>He must prepare humanity for the Greater Community through the Revelation.</p>
<p>He must speak of the great change that is coming and that is already upon the people everywhere through the Revelation.</p>
<p>God is moving humanity in a new direction.</p>
<p>Can humanity move?</p>
<p>Can people respond?</p>
<p>Can you respond?</p>
<p>Can you accept that you are living in a time of Revelation and consider what this means for your life and the challenge this places before you?</p>
<p>People do not realize how much their life and circumstances are dependent upon the condition of the world and the movement of the world.</p>
<p>Only in the poorer nations is this greater reality ever present.</p>
<p>In affluent nations, the affluence insulates you from the greater realities of life to a certain extent for a period of time. But this affluence will diminish, and the greater realities are upon you.</p>
<p>How humanity responds and prepares will make all the difference.</p>
<p>What informs individuals’ decisions will make all the difference.</p>
<p>What voice they listen to, whether it be the power and the presence of Knowledge that God has given to them to guide them and to protect them, or whether it be the voice of their culture or the voice of fear or the voice of anger or ambition.</p>
<p>The choices are fundamental for the individual, and what individuals decide will determine the fate and the future of humanity.</p>
<p>Therefore, the responsibility falls upon everyone, not only on leaders and institutions.</p>
<p>That is why God is bringing the New Message to the people and not to the leaders of nations.</p>
<p>For the leaders are not free. They are bound by their office and to those who got them elected, to the expectations of others.</p>
<p>That is why the Revelation is coming to you and to the people. It is their decisions and determination that will make all the difference.</p>
<p>People want many things. They do not want to lose what they have. They are caught up in the moment. They do not have the perspective to see where their life is going.</p>
<p>The Revelation will be a great shock and a great challenge to each person, but this shock and challenge is the shock of Revelation. And this challenge is being confronted by the Will of the Creator. And the challenge is to see whether you can respond and the nature of your response.</p>
<p>You cannot stand where you are, for the world has changed, and it will change further. It is moving. You must move with it.</p>
<p>This is being in harmony with life.</p>
<p>This is coming out of isolation.</p>
<p>This is freeing yourself from distraction and obsession.</p>
<p>This is learning to listen, to look, to still your mind so that you may see.</p>
<p>This is giving up grievances so that you may understand where you are.</p>
<p>This is taking the Steps to Knowledge so that the presence and the power of God may speak through you and to you.</p>
<p>This is the Revelation, taking humanity in a new direction.</p>
<p>Are people willing to go, or will they stay behind—facing the Great Waves of change, asleep on the beach as the Great Waves build, living on the shoreline thinking that all is well, living for the moment, unable to respond to the signs of the world, living under assumptions that are not in keeping with the realities of life?</p>
<p>Who can respond?</p>
<p>Who will look?</p>
<p>Who will listen?</p>
<p>Who will set aside their ideas, their beliefs and their preferences long enough to see something, to hear something, to know something?</p>
<p>This is what the Messenger will ask you to do.</p>
<p>This is what the Revelation requires.</p>
<p>This is what living in a new world requires.</p>
<p>This is what emerging into a Greater Community of life requires.</p>
<p>Will humanity be foolish and clumsy, ignorant and unresponsive, its greater intelligence not being recognized and utilized?</p>
<p>These are the questions.</p>
<p>The answers are not apparent, for they have not yet come into being. They have not met the real test that is upon the human family.</p>
<p>But the Creator of all life loves the world and loves humanity and has sent the power of redemption into the world—to redeem the individual and to restore their power and integrity, to meet the great challenges of life that are now emerging on the horizon.</p>
<p>God is moving humanity in a new direction.</p>
<p>It is time to prepare, to receive and to support the Revelation.</p>
<p>People will complain. They will protest. They will resist. They will accuse the Messenger. They will denounce the Revelation. Unable to respond, unwilling to reconsider their life and their ideas, they will resist.</p>
<p>This always happens at the time of Revelation.</p>
<p>Those who have the greatest investment in the past will resist the new world and everything in it.</p>
<p>They cannot see. They will not know. They do not have the courage to reconsider their position. They do not have the humility to stand in the face of the Revelation.</p>
<p>What can God do for them?</p>
<p>They asked so much from the Creator, but they cannot respond to the Creator’s response.</p>
<p>What can God do for them?</p>
<p>Be amongst the first to respond so that your greater gifts in life may be established and have an opportunity to come forth in the days and the years of your life.</p>
<p>This is the power of Revelation—to unleash wisdom and Knowledge that humanity desperately needs now to prepare for a future that will be unlike the past.</p>
<p>The blessings are with you. The power of redemption is within you, in Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>But what can ignite this Knowledge and call it forth and enable you to approach it, to understand it and to follow it successfully?</p>
<p>It must be ignited by God, and the Revelation is here to set in motion the greater redemption of individuals in preparation for the new world and for humanity’s destiny in the universe, which is yet to be recognized and fulfilled.</p>
<p>It is time to respond.</p>
<p>It is time to be really honest with yourself, not basing your life on your preferences or your fears, but on true recognition within yourself.</p>
<p>Facing the Revelation will challenge you to respond with this deeper honesty.</p>
<p>Facing the Revelation will challenge you with this deeper honesty.</p>
<p>It is the greatest challenge of your life.</p>
<p>It is the most important challenge of your life.</p>
<p>It is the most important event of your life.</p>
<p>God is moving humanity in a new direction.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
May 27, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado </p>
<p>God’s New Revelation opens the doors to a universe of intelligent life, providing perspective, insight and understanding never available before.</p>
<p>The human family does not realize its vulnerability to this Greater Community or its relationship with this Greater Community. </p>
<p>Living in isolation for so very long, your whole notion of yourself, your notion of Creation and the Divine, are very much associated with this one world alone. Yet so many people in the world today have roots in the Greater Community, for much of their previous experience occurred there before coming into this world in this life.</p>
<p>It is like you are an isolated tribe who has never been discovered by the outer world, not knowing the greater powers that exist around you and completely unprepared for the day when your existence would be discovered from the outside.</p>
<p>Humanity has been broadcasting into space, quite foolishly of course, and so your presence is well known to your neighbors and to other groups who are watching the world with great interest.</p>
<p>For some, you have been studied for a very long time. While they might find your deeper nature incomprehensible, your outer behavior can be easily discerned and is quite predictable.</p>
<p>You are standing at the threshold of an entirely different reality, a non-human universe—a universe where human values and aspirations are not universally shared, a universe where your existence and where your importance is of little or no consequence, except to those races who either seek to support human freedom in the world or those races who seek to take it from you.</p>
<p>The Greater Community will alter how you see yourself, how nations here interact with one another and the whole priority of humanity. Its impact can be extremely beneficial if you can understand it correctly. </p>
<p>For it is the Greater Community that will finally persuade your nations to cooperate, to unite for the preservation of the world and the protection of the human family.</p>
<p>It is the Greater Community that will show you that you cannot afford your ceaseless conflicts here on Earth, and that your resources here are precious, and your self-sufficiency is of the greatest importance. </p>
<p>With this awareness, you would not continue to squander the world at the terrible pace that you are doing so now. You would not foolishly think the universe is there for the taking once you exhaust the wealth of this world. You would understand that this world is all that you have. This world, this Solar System, is all that you have. </p>
<p>Beyond this, you are entering regions owned or controlled by others, and you cannot take this from them. You do not know the rules of engagement in the universe or the relations between nations or what is allowed and what is not allowed in this Greater Community of life.</p>
<p>You are like the child entering the metropolis—innocent, assuming, unaware. </p>
<p>People want many things from visitors here. They expect many things. People feel they are very important in the universe and that others would naturally come here to help you and to give you what you wanted and needed. People think Contact is kind of a thrilling adventure, a holiday from the mundanity of human life. They want to think that this Contact would be very positive and beneficial because they do not have the strength, the courage or the preparation to consider it in any other way.</p>
<p>God’s Revelation is providing you a window into this Greater Community of life, a window that only God could provide. For there is nothing in the universe that God is not aware of. No race can certainly make such a claim. No race has the comprehension of even this one galaxy. No race has a comprehension of the deeper nature of humanity.</p>
<p>Even those few races in this region of space who are free and self-determined, even they cannot fully understand what human nature really means.</p>
<p>Everyone in the universe is seeking resources, and the more technologically advanced nations are very dependent upon this. You do not reach a place where this need ceases to exist because as you advance technologically, the need escalates in response to it.</p>
<p>Humanity does not know it is at a great threshold, a great turning point, a turning point that will create a future unlike the past. Living in a declining world, a world of declining resources and shrinking opportunities, you do not see your great vulnerability to space. Your borders are unguarded. Your people are unaware. Your governments are subsumed in their internal difficulties and problems with one another. </p>
<p>This world is such a beautiful place, so rich biologically, with so many important resources that are difficult to find in a universe of barren worlds.</p>
<p>The Revelation from God must awaken you to the realities, the difficulties and the opportunities of emerging into a Greater Community of intelligent life. None of God’s previous Revelations were required to do this because the need was not there. Humanity had not progressed that far. </p>
<p>But you now have a global civilization—diffracted, conflicted, destructive, heedless and irresponsible, but it is a world community nonetheless. You have global communication. You have global commerce. And for many people, a growing global awareness. It is at this point that intervention will be attempted. It is at this point that humanity becomes a prize to be claimed.</p>
<p>Those who will come here and are here already cannot live in the biologically complex world that you inhabit and to which you are adapted. They need human assistance. They need human allegiance. They need human participation in order to gain sovereignty and control here. And they will take advantage of your expectations, your desires, your fantasies and your grievances to establish this position for themselves.</p>
<p>Look at the history of intervention in your world. Look how easily native peoples succumbed to the presence of foreign intervention. This must not be your fate. </p>
<p>If you begin to think within this larger arena of life, you will begin to see things you could not see before, and you will see that human unity and cooperation are not simply a desirable future goal or a preferred option, but instead a necessity to assure the freedom and the future of the human family.</p>
<p>The Intervention seeks not to destroy you, but to use you, to use you for their own purposes. This is a reality you cannot escape, and the deception that will be cast upon the human family and the pacification that it will cast upon the human family to submit and to acquiesce are very strong and compelling. </p>
<p>Having lost faith in human leadership and institutions, people will look to other powers in the universe to guide them, believing fervently that a beneficial force will come here to restore and to save humanity from itself. It is this expectation, this desire, however unconscious it might be, that the Intervention will utilize for its own purposes. </p>
<p>Your freedom is precious, to whatever extent it has been established in the world. It has been gained through great effort and human sacrifice. It must be protected with great vigilance. </p>
<p>You are concerned only with each other in this regard, but now you have greater concerns, and with those concerns, a greater need to become educated about life in the universe and prepared for the meaning of this difficult and hazardous engagement.</p>
<p>Those who are allied to humanity, the free races, they will not intervene here, for intervention to them is a violation. They realize that even if they could gain your confidence and trust, they would have to maintain a controlling presence here in order to guide you into the Greater Community. And this, they cannot do. They realize that humanity will have to struggle, and suffer even, to come to a point of recognition and responsibility regarding its future and destiny here.</p>
<p>They can only advise. They will send their Briefings, the Briefings from the Allies of Humanity. This they have done as part of God’s New Revelation, for the Creator knows that you must realize that you are not totally alone in the universe and that freedom and self-determination exist and have been achieved by others. But this is not an easy achievement, and it has basic requirements.</p>
<p>People are shocked by these things, not because they are untrue or even that they seem sensational, but because they have never been thinking about it, and they do not even want to think about it, it is so big and complex and challenging.</p>
<p>But this is your world. This is why you have come. You did not come to sleep on a beautiful planet, but to help preserve it and protect the human family from decline and from subjugation.</p>
<p>Human conflict is wasting you away. Ignorant, foolish and unaware of what exists at your borders, human conflict is wasting you away.</p>
<p>It is time for humanity to mature, to grow up, to realize you are living in a Greater Community of life—a Greater Community you cannot control, a Greater Community that is beyond your efforts, your technology and even your comprehension.</p>
<p>That is why the Creator of all life is bringing the Revelation about the Greater Community into the world. It is time now—as humanity stands at the brink of a declining world, a world of declining resources and growing economic and political upheaval and instability; a time when the religions of the world have become partisans in an ongoing conflict and competition for human acceptance and leadership; a time when the poorer nations are running out of resources and the rich nations are falling into great indebtedness. </p>
<p>It is the perfect time for intervention. It is the necessary time for a greater human awareness to emerge and with it a greater responsibility to the world—not just to one’s nation or one’s group or one’s religious affiliation, but to all of humanity. For if nations fail, the whole world could fail. If intervention is successful in one part of the world, it threatens the future of everyone here.</p>
<p>People are full of grievance. They are full of needs. They are full of, in some cases, desperate needs—poverty and oppression. The leaders of the world are either blind or cannot communicate what they have been told, what they see and know. So the peoples of the nations remain ignorant about the greatest event in human history, the greatest challenge to human freedom and sovereignty and the greatest opportunity for human unity and cooperation. </p>
<p>For you will not be able to engage with a Greater Community of life as a warring and conflicting set of tribes and nations. You will have no strength and efficacy there, and your vulnerability will be so apparent to others.</p>
<p>Humanity is destroying the wealth of the world, and that too has prompted intervention.</p>
<p>There is so much for you to learn. It cannot be communicated in a few words, but in a great series of teachings, which are part of God’s Revelation.</p>
<p>Here a Christian must become a Christian with a Greater Community awareness. A Muslim becomes a Muslim with a Greater Community awareness. A Buddhist and a Jew gain a greater panorama of life to which their religious teachings must become relevant. If religion in the world is to educate and to enlighten, it must have this greater capacity and awareness. </p>
<p>You cannot be fooling around in the face of the Greater Community or in the face of the Great Waves of change that are already occurring in the world. It is time to grow up. </p>
<p>Humanity has great strengths. You have not lost your connection to the deeper Knowledge that exists within each person. You have not become a regimented, secular, technological society, which are so common in the universe. You have not lost your freedom or your greater sensibilities entirely though that is being threatened with each passing day.</p>
<p>The needs of life are fundamental everywhere. Advanced technology does not relieve you of these needs entirely and in fact can escalate them tremendously. Do you think that great technological societies in the universe are not desperate for resources, resources that now they cannot create themselves but must trade for and negotiate for, from far, far away? They have lost their self-determination. They are controlled now by the very networks of trade upon which they depend.</p>
<p>To be free in the universe you must be self-sufficient, you must be united and you must be very discreet. Those are the requirements that every nation, every world, every race must establish in a Greater Community of life.</p>
<p>Here you can see the danger and the seduction of humanity receiving technology and resources from beyond the world. What a great attraction that would be! What a great seduction that is! </p>
<p>Once you lose your self-sufficiency, everything is lost that you value, for you will not be able to establish the terms of engagement to gain access to those things upon which you have now become dependent. Other nations will determine your behavior and your participation. It is a fact of life. </p>
<p>You cannot take your local universe by conquest because you will be opposed by everyone. This is a very different picture from your movies and your science fiction and your fantasies, your hopes and your unspoken expectations. This casts a very different picture on the importance of human unity and cooperation here on Earth, the importance of securing and building human freedom and the power and presence of Knowledge that God has placed within each person.</p>
<p>Here freedom is not simply to become indulgent and unaccountable to anyone or anything else. It becomes an essential element of your participation in life. Here your greater gifts can be called forth, for you realize you are here to serve the great and imperiled needs of humanity. Here everything within you that is true and genuine becomes activated and called for. Here nations will cease their endless conflicts and try to create stability for themselves and their neighbors to assure their future well-being and to protect themselves against intervention from the outside.</p>
<p>The world will not be taken by force, for that is not allowed in this part of the universe. It will be taken through seduction and persuasion, through capitalizing upon human weakness and conflict, human superstition and unfulfilled human needs.</p>
<p>Brute force is rarely used in this part of the universe. Greater, more subtle means are employed to protect the resources of the world and to gain ascendancy through persuasion, deception and secrecy. Humanity is still a clumsy, violent race in this regard, but even that is changing here on Earth.</p>
<p>We give you these perspectives because this represents the love of the Creator. Though it might be overwhelming and frightening at first, it is a reality to which you must become aware and accustomed. You must think now not only for yourself or for your community or for your nation, but for the whole world because that will determine your fate and destiny and the well-being of your children and the children of the world.</p>
<p>It is a great shift in consciousness, a great and necessary shift now. People will resist this, of course. They will take refuge in their religion. They will take refuge in their political ideology. They will take refuge in human rationality. But life in the universe is not dependent upon these things. Life is happening whether you are aware of it or not, whether you are prepared for it or not. It is not a matter of perspective. It is not a matter of ideological orientation. It is really about paying attention, being observant and objective and honest with yourself.</p>
<p>This is a great challenge, but a necessary challenge, and a redeeming challenge if it can be met honestly and sincerely. You have the eyes to see and the ears to hear, but you are not looking and you are not listening. Everyone around you seems to be obsessed, preoccupied or oppressed. Who will speak to them? Who will teach them? They may not hear Our words. Who will speak to them?</p>
<p>You need only point to the Revelation, for you yourself cannot explain life in the universe. You yourself cannot explain the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world. You yourself cannot explain what human spirituality means at the level of Knowledge. You yourself cannot explain wisdom and Knowledge from the universe. You yourself cannot explain humanity’s greater destiny and what must be done to achieve it.</p>
<p>For this you must turn to the Revelation, for the Revelation is greater than what any one person can understand. Point to the Revelation, for that alone holds the preparation for humanity’s future and destiny in an emerging world.</p>
<p>God is giving humanity what it cannot give itself. God is alerting humanity to the perils and opportunities as it stands at the threshold of space. God is alerting humanity to the dangers and the opportunities and necessities of living in a declining world. God is bringing into the world a clarification of the nature and purpose of human spirituality, a nature and purpose that has been so lost and obscured in God’s previous Revelations.</p>
<p>The Revelation is vast. It speaks of so many things. You cannot exhaust it, and you must use it and apply it and share its reality with others. It is only then that you will see what it really means and why it is necessary and why it holds the great promise for the future and the freedom of the people of this world. </p>
<p>For success is not assured. Many peoples in the universe have fallen under persuasion and subjugation. It has happened countless times. It is the inevitable outcome of people not being alerted and prepared to engage with a larger arena of intelligent life.</p>
<p>Beware of your own fantasies and expectations. Question them. Consider them in light of the realities of nature and of human history. </p>
<p>If you are honest with yourself, you must come to see that you do not know what is beyond the borders of this world, and that hopeful expectations can be extremely blinding. You must be prepared for anything and everything, just as you must be prepared for anything and everything functioning in this world—in human relationships and through the activities of life itself.</p>
<p>To be free, you must be strong. To be strong, your mind must be clear. You must see clearly. You must hear the truth. You must be objective about your life and circumstances. You must look upon the world not with grievance or avoidance, but with compassion, patience and determination. If you are to forge the groundwork for a new future here, to play your small but important part here, then you must have this approach.</p>
<p>Accept this gift of love and Revelation. It brings with it great responsibility, but also great strength and great promise.</p>
<p>You are not living yet the life you were meant to live because your life is not engaged with the Greater Reality that lives within you and all around you. For humanity, this is a great turning point. And for you, it is a great turning point.</p>
<p>People of the world must awaken to the Greater Community and to the condition of the world they live in. You must learn of your greater strength and greater wisdom that God has placed within you to guide you, to prepare you and to protect you.</p>
<p>God has spoken again. It is for the greatest purpose to meet the greatest set of needs.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on April 12, 2011<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>The New Message is here to direct humanity and to preserve human civilization. It is the answer to innumerable prayers for the restoration of the individual and to bring greater cooperation, strength and creativity to the human family at its time of greatest need and travail.</p>
<p>It is so great that people cannot fathom it, though they may think they understand. And yet it is so simple that people can use it today, in every situation, with every person they meet, in every set of circumstances.</p>
<p>The New Message is to prepare humanity for living in a new world and to prepare humanity to engage with life beyond this world, an engagement that is part of your destiny and evolution.</p>
<p>At this moment, humanity is unprepared for both of these great turning points—these great thresholds that will require greater strength, greater discernment and greater compassion from people everywhere.</p>
<p>It is a tremendous calling for the individual to become wise and responsible, capable and perceptive. It is a gift for all peoples and nations. It is a gift for this time and the times to come. It answers questions you have not even yet learned to ask. It addresses problems that people are not yet aware of.</p>
<p>It brings with it the wisdom of the Creator. It is sent through the Angelic Presence, who translates the Will of the Creator into words, ideas and application.</p>
<p>The New Message provides its own commentary and practices. For it cannot be left up to people and individuals, even scholars and experts, to determine what it means and how it should be practiced. The New Message itself speaks of these things and clarifies these things so that very little is left up to human speculation and human interpretation. This is to minimize the potential for error that will always arise when people are dealing with something of this magnitude.</p>
<p>Great care is being made to provide this teaching, application and commentary—said in many different ways, applied to different situations, expressed again and again so that its clarity may be apparent and so there will be minimal ambiguity associated with it.</p>
<p>For the first time, a New Revelation is being given to a literate world, to a world of planetary communications, planetary commerce and for some people even planetary awareness.</p>
<p>It is being given now in great depth and comprehensiveness so that it can bridge cultures, temperaments, nationalities and racial distinctions and so that it can be accessible and comprehensible to the individual, without having to rely upon great scholars or institutions to determine what it means, what it says and how the person should respond.</p>
<p>The New Message calls upon the greater power of Knowledge within the individual to arise—a power beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect, a power that is incomprehensible and yet immediately part of your experience.</p>
<p>For some, this will be very difficult to deal with. They look at everything in the world like it is a resource for their mind. But Knowledge is too great to be a resource for your mind. People who claim to be following Knowledge will be following their ideas. People who claim to be guided by Knowledge will be guided by their social conditioning or by their ambitions. And so for certain people this will be very difficult to comprehend. It is because of how they look at themselves and the world that this is the case.</p>
<p>Not everyone will be able to apprehend the great truth at this time. But if enough people can, it gives great promise to the future, the safety and the freedom of humanity.</p>
<p>The new world will be more perilous than the world you are accustomed to. And the Greater Community of life is far more complex and sophisticated.</p>
<p>You will have to learn of it. You will have to learn Wisdom and Knowledge from the Greater Community. And that is something that only God can really teach you now. Even other races cannot do this, for they do not know the human mind and the human heart sufficiently, and they do not value freedom, except for a few races.</p>
<p>You were born into this time. You were born for this time. It is your destiny to be here, to learn of these things. It is your destiny to receive these words. It is your destiny to discover the New Revelation.</p>
<p>Many people in the world have not been able to give themselves to the religious traditions of humanity because there is something in them that has told them to wait. Perhaps they justify this based upon the limitations or the difficulties existing within certain traditions. But that is not really the issue, you see, for they are really meant for something else, and they have had to wait for the Revelation. It is not merely that their tradition is inadequate in some way. The truth is they are meant for something else because of their nature and their design, because of their purpose, because of destiny.</p>
<p>This is a power greater than human understanding, and it brings with it its own challenges and its great blessing and opportunities.</p>
<p>The return to God is not an intellectual enterprise. You do not come to God on your terms. Reality and Creation are not based on your understanding or evaluation. Heaven does not value your ideas, only your participation.</p>
<p>Destiny is not something that you can prescribe for yourself, nor something you can define and say, “This is my destiny because I like the idea.”</p>
<p>Destiny has to do with where you have come from and where you are going and why you are in the world and where the world is going—things that are far beyond most people’s consideration or awareness.</p>
<p>Destiny will lead you, for it is part of Knowledge within you—the greater intelligence that God has given you to prepare you and protect you, to clarify your way and to engage you with your destiny.</p>
<p>The people of the New Revelation are part of a new threshold of understanding for humanity as humanity enters a new world—a world of environmental change; a world of political and economic instabilities; a world of diminishing resources; a world where the risk of competition, conflict and war will be very great; a world that requires a greater cooperation and a sense of shared destiny with others.</p>
<p>For divided, humanity will fail in the Greater Community and fall under the persuasion of foreign powers, as has happened countless times in the history of the universe. That is your great risk.</p>
<p>Yet who is aware of this? Who thinks of this? Who is concerned with this? What people think, believe and expect is so very different from what God knows, and that is the gulf that must be bridged. That is why God has put Knowledge within you—to enable you to gain this greater comprehension and to discern a Greater Reality.</p>
<p>God has provided the <em>Steps to Knowledge</em> to re-engage your surface mind—your social mind, your worldly mind—with the deeper mind of Knowledge. This is where you become really integrated. This is where you establish and experience your integrity.</p>
<p>This is what gives you the strength and power of Heaven as you take your journey here on Earth. This gives purpose, meaning and direction to your existence here and calls to you certain individuals who will play a significant role in the discovery and expression of the greater purpose that has brought you here at this time, under these circumstances. This is your destiny.</p>
<p>Do not complain about the world. Do not be resentful or jaded in your outlook, for this is the world you have come to serve. It is perfect for you. It is why you have come.</p>
<p>Do not deny it, or you will deny your own purpose for being here. Do not condemn it, or you will condemn yourself along with it. Do not disassociate from it, or you will lose contact with your deeper nature.</p>
<p>Destiny is upon you now. The great calling is going out. The Messenger is being prepared to speak to the world. The New Revelation is here.</p>
<p>What a great blessing this is to be in the world at this time—the time of Revelation! What a great blessing it is for you to learn of these things. What a great blessing it is to have a destiny, to learn of it and to have the humility and the wisdom to accept it.</p>
<p>People have difficulty with these things because of the degree to which they associate with their beliefs, their complaints and their idea of themselves, which rarely have anything to do with who they are or why they are in the world.</p>
<p>Change is hard for people, particularly change on the inside, but it is natural and necessary, or you cannot assume a greater life or a greater purpose. And you will not be available for greater relationships and a greater union with others.</p>
<p>It is the price of admission. It is what it means to have your prayers answered. For to have your prayers answered means a door has opened for you, and you must go through. It is a journey not of your making and does not happen according to your terms, ideas and expectations.</p>
<p>For God to help you, you must let God help you and guide you. God guides you and helps you through the power and presence of Knowledge.</p>
<p>But you must become connected to Knowledge, take the <em>Steps to Knowledge</em>, experience its reality, its potency and develop the skills of patience and perseverance that will be necessary for you to journey into regions of life and experience that are not part of your concepts or current understanding.</p>
<p>God knows what is coming over the horizon. The question is, can people respond and prepare, and can they receive the preparation that the Creator of all life is sending into the world?</p>
<p>Humanity cannot prepare itself. It does not know what it is preparing for. It is completely ignorant of life in the universe. It knows not how to prepare for this. It does not expect or anticipate having to adapt to a new world.</p>
<p>So it is quite unprepared and foolish, thinking that the future will be like the past, living in the past, associating with the past, unable to see the changing circumstances of the world—the changing landscape and the great change that is coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>You have very little time to prepare for all these things, for they are in motion, and you cannot stop them. You cannot stop having to enter into a new world. You cannot stop your emergence into a Greater Community of life in the universe. The Intervention is already underway in the world by clever races who are here to take advantage of human ignorance and human expectations.</p>
<p>You cannot escape your destiny, you see, and this destiny will either uplift you, or it will defeat you, depending on how you prepare and your ability to respond—your responsibility.</p>
<p>This is really the time. You do not have time to languish. You do not have time to hide out in ambivalence. You do not have time to lose yourself in your hobbies, your romances or your distractions.</p>
<p>The world is changing. It is moving beneath your feet. It is shaking your cities. It is depriving your peoples. It is changing how you are going to live in the world. It is changing the weather, the climate, the landscape, the ability to grow food and the resources you will need to maintain civilization.</p>
<p>It is momentous. It is tremendous. But people are asleep, dreaming, lost, unresponsive, obsessed, preoccupied, distracted, believing what they are told by leaders who know little more than they do about what is coming over the horizon.</p>
<p>But people cannot be completely foolish because Knowledge lives within them, and Knowledge is sending the warning signs. That is why people are feeling apprehensive. That is why people are feeling uncertain about the stability and the future of humanity. That is why people are concerned.</p>
<p>It is this concern that gives you a clue that at some deeper level you are responding to the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world and to humanity’s changing position in the universe.</p>
<p>It is an indicator of great change. You do not understand it. You cannot define it. But you are here to learn to deal with it because that is your destiny.</p>
<p>From a greater standpoint, from a standpoint of Creation, destiny is everything. But it is not a destiny you created. It is the destiny that God has given you. It is why you are here. It is why your personality has been shaped the way it is. It is perfect for your true vocation in life, a vocation you have likely not found yet.</p>
<p>This is destiny. This exists beyond the realm of the intellect. Beyond the realm of philosophy and theology and ideology, beyond preference, beyond fear, beyond confusion, beyond human certainty—the pretense of human certainty—beyond religious beliefs, beyond political positions, beyond economic theory is destiny.</p>
<p>Your mind will not understand, but at a deeper level you will begin to respond because at a deeper level, you are connected to destiny.</p>
<p>You are destined to meet certain people if you can make your rendezvous, if you do not fall away on the way to your greater engagement with each other.</p>
<p>It is destiny that you will have to face the new world and the realities of the Greater Community that God will reveal to you through the New Revelation.</p>
<p>It is destiny that you are hearing these words. It is destiny that has brought the New Message to you and has brought you to the New Message.</p>
<p>Eventually, you will understand many of these things. But for the moment, it is a matter of giving greater faith that the power of Knowledge lives within you, that it is pure and that it is the creation of God.</p>
<p>It is the humility and the discernment you bring that will enable you to tell the difference between Knowledge and your own beliefs, fears and ambitions and the beliefs, fears and ambitions of others.</p>
<p>This is where you become skillful. This is where you become discerning. This is where you are not like a child that has to be led and guided, unknowingly, for that will not be appropriate in the new world.</p>
<p>Humanity must grow up. Its citizens must become aware and alerted, prepared and strengthened. Allow children to be children, but as an adult, you must gain this greater perspective and assume greater responsibilities.</p>
<p>These are not ancient times. You are not asked to be like sheep. You are asked to rise to the occasion, to take the <em>Steps to Knowledge</em> and to allow Knowledge to reshape your life and reveal to you your greater destiny.</p>
<p>This is the Will of Heaven, and this now must become the intention of humanity.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on November 23, 2007<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>Around the world love is held to be in the highest esteem, as a pinnacle of human experience. Love is sung about in songs, written about in poetry. It is exalted in great literature. It is bandied about in normal conversation. People claim they are in love, that love is the ultimate, that all you need in the world is love and everything will work out just fine. But very few people understand what love really is. And very few people have experienced love at a deeper level—beyond fascination, beyond infatuation and attachment. Few people have experienced the real power and current of love.</p>
<p>In addition, many people associate certain kinds of behaviors, beliefs and attitudes with love—gentleness, passivity are associated with love. Peace and harmony are associated with love. But really what is this deeper love, not a love that is simply a fixation, an infatuation or an attachment, but a deeper kind of love that is redemptive, that emanates from a deeper place within the individual.</p>
<p>And beyond this, what is God’s love, the love of God? Is this merely an infatuation, a fixation or an attachment? Most people will say no, but they are unclear what the love of God really means and how this love is expressed and how it can be translated into the world effectively.</p>
<p>So today we will speak on Love, the greater love that lives within each individual and the greater love of God, that is the sum of all love in the Universe, and is the source of all real love everywhere—in this world and in the Greater Community of worlds. And we shall speak about what God’s New Message for the world teaches about love, for there is a New Message from God in the world, and love is part of its message.</p>
<p>It is necessary here to begin by saying what love is not. Love is not fascination. Love is not fixation. Love is not attachment. Love is not romance where you are infatuated or taken with someone else’s appearance or some aspect of their personality. It is not idolatry, where you idolize someone, you worship someone, even a Deity, even a Messenger, even God. But these do not represent a real relationship, a working relationship, a relationship of united wills.</p>
<p>Love is not a behavior, an attitude, a mannerism. It is not etiquette. It is not convention. Love may express itself in many different ways—softly or forcibly. Love can appear meek. Love can appear strong. Love can challenge you. Love can criticize you. Love can expose your illusions, your fantasies and your self-deception. Love is not what people really mean when they talk about love, in nearly all circumstances.</p>
<p>Love is a deeper power that moves people to do things that are different from their ideas, their beliefs and their sense of obligation. Love is something beyond the love you hear about in conversations. In fact, it is better to demonstrate love than to talk about it, for real love is demonstrated. It is what moves people to change their lives, to refocus their priorities, to associate with something deeper and more profound within themselves. It is something that has the power to override human ambition, human selfishness, human grievance and all partisan beliefs and attitudes, religious ideology.</p>
<p>For love is not bound by these things. It is only restrained, held back or hidden by these things. But love moves on its own accord, being associated with the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within each person. For you see, you were born with two minds—a mind to think with and a mind to know. The mind that you think with is a product of all of your social conditioning. It is a product of being in the world. It is an accumulation of ideas, associations and patterns of thinking that you have been learning since the day you were born. Much of this is useful, and some of it is hazardous and dangerous to you. Certainly, you have had to learn how to survive in the world—how to survive physically, how to survive socially, how to participate within a family environment, within a culture or perhaps within a religious framework. You have had to learn how to communicate your ideas and feelings. You have had to learn what society has told you you have to learn. As we have said, some of this is useful and important and some of this is hazardous and not in your best interests.</p>
<p>But you were born with a deeper mind, the mind of Knowledge. This mind does not think like your intellect thinks. It sees and it knows. It is not what people think of when they talk about the subconscious mind. That is more associated with your worldly mind, or intellect. This deeper mind is not subject to conditioning in the world. It is not patterned or conditioned by the world. It is not threatened or intimidated by the world. This deeper mind is called Knowledge in the New Message because it is related to the experience of direct knowing, the experience of affinity, the experience of true recognition and the experience of true relationship.</p>
<p>Real love emanates from Knowledge. It in essence is the expression of Knowledge. When Knowledge moves you to do something—perhaps something you were never planning to do, something you do not understand, something that flies in the face of your plans and goals and ambitions. This expresses love because you are expressing the will of God, which is the love of God. For God’s love is not separate from God’s will. God does not think like your intellect thinks—happy one day, sad the next, happy with this, angry with that, cruel and punishing over those who make mistakes or who live in error. This is not God! This is the human mind projecting a human mind onto God and projecting onto God human feelings and grievances. It is all a projection of the human mind. But God is beyond all this. And the love and the will of God is beyond all this.</p>
<p>So if you live in your personal mind or what you could call your “surface mind,” well, all your notions of God are associated with your personal mind. You think that God is just a super personality, a huge gigantic intellect, but an intellect that is subject to fear and anxiety, to hatred and recrimination, to judgment and punishment, to fixed ideas, to righteousness and heresy. This is a God that people think thinks like them, acts like them, behaves like them.</p>
<p>But when you think about what God really is, well, God of the Greater Community, God of all intelligent life in the Universe, certainly a God of the Universe, of the Greater Community, cannot be conditioned by human beliefs, human attitudes, human emotions, human social conventions and all of the petty things that keep humanity in a primitive and undeveloped state.</p>
<p>If God is God of the Greater Community, then God is author of countless forms of intelligent life, of countless worlds where intelligent life has evolved. God is the author of evolution. God is the author and source of the expansion of the Universe. God is the author of all scientific truth. God is the creator of countless races of beings who do not look like you, think like you or have your value system. God is the author of nature, which functions within the world and beyond the world and within all worlds in this Universe and beyond—at all levels of manifestation. This is a God so great that it transcends all theological ideas, religious systems of belief, religious organizations. It is better to set aside your ideas of God and to follow what God has placed within you to follow, to see what God has placed within you to see, to hear what God has placed within you to hear.</p>
<p>Only here can you experience God and experience your relationship with God, and ultimately, if you are successful in following the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself, you will discover God’s will for you in this life, in this world, at this time.</p>
<p>Because you cannot understand God, it also means you cannot understand God’s will. It also means you cannot understand God’s love, the love of God. But you can experience these things because God has given you a deeper, greater mind, the mind of Knowledge. You can speculate, you can theorize, you can establish elaborate systems of thought, elaborate mental constructions, but if you cannot experience the movement of Knowledge in your life, the wisdom of Knowledge in your life, which is giving you counsel all along—counsel which you cannot hear, counsel which you do not respond to because your attention is fixated on the surface, on your intellect and on your perception of the world. If you cannot feel this deeper movement, well, God is foreign to you. God is an idea which you can either accept or set aside.</p>
<p>God has placed an expression of God’s will and love within you, deep within you, deep beneath the intellect, a will and love you cannot control, you cannot dominate, you cannot use it to gain wealth, power or influence. You can only submit to it. You can only follow it and learn from it and carry out what it gives you to do to re-establish your life, to rebuild your mind, to rebuild your health, to refocus your life, to re-establish a greater set of priorities for yourself and with them a greater opportunity for relationship with others.</p>
<p>It is this greater love that is so far beyond and distinct from the love you hear about in conversation. People say, “I love this. I love him. I love her. I love this food. I love this place. I love your dress. I love nature. I love the woods. I love the ocean.”</p>
<p>Real love is something beyond all this. The real love that moves you to give your life, that refocuses your life, that tells you that you are in error, that confronts you with the fact that your life has been misspent and you are trying to take it in a direction that is not its true direction, this is love! (18:22)</p>
<p>The love that keeps orienting you towards your greater purpose for coming into the world regardless of your plans and goals, the love that does not change, the love that does not adapt to your wishes, this is the love!</p>
<p>At times, it is confronting and challenging, and you feel that it is just too much. And at times, it is comforting and reassuring, and you welcome it and are so glad it exists, that it is true.</p>
<p>This is the Great Love—the love of God and the love of God that has been placed in you, in Knowledge within you, in the deeper mind within you. This deeper mind is here on a mission. It is here on a purpose, for you have come into the world on a mission, for a purpose, to do specific things with specific people. And Knowledge within you is trying to take you there, aim you in the right direction so you can make your rendezvous with these certain individuals and to find the circumstances and the environment where your greater purpose can emerge, can be activated. While people are making elaborate plans and are reinforcing what they are doing and what they believe, Knowledge within them is trying to take them somewhere.</p>
<p>Therefore, never think that people are always in the right place, doing what they should be doing. It is not true. It is just an excuse. It’s kind of a way that people say to make things okay, to make things all right, when in fact, their life is miscast. They are not where they need to be. They are functioning at a level that does not represent their greater purpose for coming here, or they are circumscribe by poverty or political oppression, or they are locked in place and cannot find another way.</p>
<p>But God’s love is still resident within them. It will never give up. It is not like your intellect, which in its shifting desires, and its changing beliefs and its confusion, in its radical ideas, its fundamentalism. The only thing really fundamental within you is Knowledge because it is the only thing that is permanent within you. And this Knowledge is not circumscribed by religious ideology or by nationalistic passion. It cannot be used as a weapon. It cannot be used to oppress others. It cannot be used to divide and conquer. Knowledge can only be followed. It cannot be used. The mind must serve Spirit. It is not the other way around.</p>
<p>People want God to do things for them, as if God is their servant. People want God to protect them from danger or catastrophe. They want God to deliver what they want for themselves, as if God is kind of a, it is like a servant. This is where the mind wants Spirit to serve the mind. The intellect wants God to serve and reinforce the intellect. This is completely backwards. This is upside down. For in truth, your body is meant to serve the mind, and your mind is meant to serve Spirit, or Knowledge. And Knowledge is here to serve God. That is the true hierarchy of your Being. That is the only arrangement where your integrity can be experienced and established, where you can find union within yourself.</p>
<p>Ultimately here, everything serves God because if the body serves the mind, and the mind serves the Spirit, and the Spirit serves God, well, everything serves God. But to gain this integrity, to gain this inner harmony, this union of all aspects of yourself, requires a great preparation—a preparation you cannot invent for yourself, a preparation that is not some kind of eclectic approach where you take what you like from this tradition and what you like from that and you kind of patch it all together, based upon your preferences. This is merely using the Spirit to substantiate the mind. It is incorrect from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Knowledge will take you somewhere you could not take yourself. Knowledge will take you beyond your fears and your preferences because all preferences are based on fear—the fear of not having, the fear of being wrong, the fear of losing, the fear of death.</p>
<p>In this world, there is much that has been accomplished in religion and in spirituality. If you could understand the evolution of life in other worlds, you would see how much humanity has achieved, despite its many errors. You would see that religion in this world has actually gone very far. You would see that other more technologically advanced races have lost all their religion, all their understanding of spirituality. They have become much more mechanical, much more rigid, based upon ideas, based upon their science, based upon their political dictates and social structure.</p>
<p>Do not think that religion in this world is a big mistake. It is actually the only thing that humanity has to offer the Greater Community at this point. What has been achieved in terms of personal freedom and spiritual awareness is actually very good in light of your position in the Universe as a whole. And this is an important understanding because humanity’s future will be in the Greater Community, and whether you will remain a free and self-determined race will be determined by your interactions with the Greater Community.</p>
<p>What is love? Love is the movement of Knowledge. Or said in other words, love is the will of God expressing itself through you. Here love is associated with inspiration, where the mind is infused with Spirit, where the mind yields to Spirit, where the mind is directed by Spirit. Sometimes this happens spontaneously. Sometimes this happens at a time when you are extremely disappointed, and you hear something within yourself that provides hope when you feel hopeless.</p>
<p>But to gain access to Knowledge, to take the steps to Knowledge, requires a very focused approach. And this approach must be given by God because only God knows how you can reconnect your thinking and the deeper mind of Knowledge within you.</p>
<p>There is much for your intellect to do and to consider, and even its great skills have not really been cultivated fully within people, but in this matter, you must receive the grace of God, which is the love of God. Your life is lost. You don’t know who you are or what you are doing and you finally come to a point of disappointment where you realize that this is actually your condition and has been your condition all along. And God sends you the Steps to Knowledge. You may wish that God would give you a new job, a new relationship, a nicer body, or God would rid you of your difficulties. That is what people want God to do for them. God sends them what can redeem them, not what they want. What they want will only perpetuate their condition, their disassociation, will only prevent them from gaining the opportunity to gain access to Knowledge. So God and God’s love give what is needed for redemption.</p>
<p>It is only when you realize that getting more of what you want will not make a difference that you will turn to Knowledge. It is only when your plans for personal fulfillment are shown to be weak and fallible and unfulfilling that you will turn to Knowledge. Here profound disappointment is extremely important and holds a great opportunity for you. But extreme disappointment is what everyone wants to avoid, so they keep trying to plan and scheme and focus their life to get what they want. Their predicament is only deepened. Knowledge is speaking to them all along, but they cannot hear. They are not open to that. They want what they want. They are driven by fear and preference. And so love is unknown to them.</p>
<p>Love is what gives them what they want. Love is what looks good. Love is what feels good in the moment. And as a result, people’s notion of love becomes a source of their addictions. And love becomes kind of an addiction. You must have this person. You must live in this place. You must have this food. You must have this pleasure. You must have this drug.</p>
<p>God’s love is the movement of Knowledge within you, for this movement is moving you in a direction of your redemption and your fulfillment in the world. To find this redemption and fulfillment, you must be freed from those relationships and those obligations that are keeping you locked in your life. Redemption is not something you just simply add on to your life, it is just another thing you are managing in your life. It is not simply an addition. It is your life. Everything that Knowledge moves you to do, whether it be urging you to avoid something or urging you towards something is all aimed towards your redemption. And your redemption means that you have connected your thinking mind with Knowledge, That is redemption. That is the beginning of real promise for you. You are not redeemed to God. You have never been separated from God. God has no anger towards you. You have placed yourself in exile. You have entered a reality where God is not known, where God is forgotten, where God is about idolatry, belief and ritual. What redeems you is taking the steps to Knowledge, connecting mind with Spirit, your thinking mind with the real power of Knowledge within you—not your beliefs about Spirit or spirituality or religion, but with the reality.</p>
<p>Many people cannot differentiate between their beliefs and reality. They think their beliefs are reality. “What I believe is what is real,” they say. “What I believe is the truth,” they say. “What I believe is God’s will,” they say. And yet the more adamant they are, the more it demonstrates that they are not yet connected to Knowledge. They have not yet been redeemed.</p>
<p>The intellect must yield to what God has placed within you. What God has placed within you is the will and plan of God for your life, which is connected to the will and plan of God for all life—within this world, beyond this world, throughout the Greater Community of worlds in the Universe in which you live. So big! When you see how big it is, you realize that your thoughts are never going to contain it or define it. But Knowledge within you is completely uniform. It is in complete harmony with Knowledge within everyone else. And that is why it is the great peacemaker in the world. Any real peace that has been fostered and established has come from Knowledge. Otherwise, peace agreements are economical or political arrangements to restrain war and conflict. No peace has really been established. Peace is the result of people recognizing and connecting with each other, not simply trading over a boundary, not simply looking at each other from a distance, but learning to recognize and to communicate and related to each other.</p>
<p>With the growing population of the world, you have a great opportunity to establish human unity, a great necessity to establish human unity. Living in a world of diminishing resources, this growing population will have to unite for its own survival. The very condition of scarcity you are creating creates the greater impetus for human unity. This is all the work of Knowledge.</p>
<p>God does not will that humanity have an overpopulated world, world of diminishing resources. But Knowledge will continue to move people towards their redemption regardless of the circumstances! Even if you create a nightmare scenario in the world, Knowledge within you and others will move you towards redemption. God then is not the author of what you think and do. God is the author of your redemption. God is the source of the greater purpose that has brought you and every other person into the world. And anyone who can recover their Ancient Memory will experience the power and the authority of God. And anyone who can take the step to Knowledge to bring Knowledge into their awareness will experience the love of God.</p>
<p>Love is like the air you breathe. You take it for granted. You never think about it. But you need it every moment. Love is like the air. Can you experience it? Knowledge is within you. It is quiet. It is also giving you counsel. Can you feel it? Can you hear it? Are you willing to go to it with your hands open, without demands, without beliefs, just go to it? “I go to God.” You go to God. “ What is God’s will for me? What must I do in this situation? Should I be with this person? Yes or no? Should I go to this place? Yes or no? Should I engage in this activity? Yes or No?”</p>
<p>Everything is simple. No deals. No compromises. “Well, I’ll do a little of …I’ll give a little of this if God gives a little of that. I’ll make a deal with God.” No deals. You are either open to guidance or you are not. You are either willing to put in doubt what you want for yourself, or you are not. It does not mean that you surrender yourself to God. That is…that happens perhaps much later. This is just a little opening, a little willingness, a beginning. You have to begin as a beginner. You cannot simply leap into a mature state in your relationship with God. You have to take the steps. And God provides the steps.</p>
<p>Love is the movement of Knowledge within you. Knowledge is the greater intelligence that God has placed within you, to guide, to protect and to lead you to the discovery of your greater purpose in this world at this time. Everything else that calls itself love is just a parade. It has no devotion in it. It has no wisdom in it. It is without substance. Life will not support it. That is why people fall in love, begin a relationship, and then find out in the relationship if they can even be in the relationship, which often they cannot. So where is the love? What is the love here? Just an initial fascination? An attachment to something you think is going to save you or make you what you want to be?</p>
<p>People grow old. They lose their beauty. They lose their charm. Life confronts you with difficulties and requirements. You must produce. You must work. You must deal with adversity. What happened to the love back there at the beginning that was so ecstatic and wonderful? Then what people think was love becomes kind of a survival arrangement or convenience.</p>
<p>There is a greater love. There is the Great Love, the love that God has placed within you, within every person, waiting to be discovered, waiting to be expressed and experienced. This love does not have only one appearance. It is not associated with a certain kind of behavior or etiquette. It is not a social convention. This love will pull you away from danger. This love will challenge your thinking and your attitudes. This love will show you that your life is going nowhere. This love will move you to go one way when you want to go another. This love will restrain you. This love will redirect you. This is a Great Love. This is the real thing! Even if you are all alone in life, if you can feel the movement of Knowledge, you will feel the love of God. You will not understand it. You will not be sure where it is taking you. You will not be sure what it means. But if you can follow it, you will experience it. And step by step, increment by increment, it will move your life into a different position and open a greater opportunity for you.</p>
<p>Here you must practice patience and forbearance. You must suspend judgment and delay your need for conclusions because you need to receive from God. Before you can give what God has given you to give, you must receive from God. You must let God redeem your life.</p>
<p>Some people think that redemption is just assuming a belief system: “I am redeemed because I now believe!” But this is not redemption. Belief is weak and fallible. It has to constantly be reinforced. It does not have the power of Knowledge. It is a human invention! You will have to have faith in Knowledge within yourself, but even here you realize that Knowledge is greater than your understanding. And where Knowledge is taking you is beyond your current awareness.</p>
<p>If you can follow, you can find. If you can find, you can fulfill. If you can fulfill, you can express.</p>
<p>This is the Great Love. And the need for this Great Love is immense. Look in the world around you. So many people. So much difficulty. So much danger, with greater danger threatening on the horizon. Where is the Great Love? In your life, with all of your busy-ness and activities, your preoccupations and concerns, your grievances, your fixations, where is the Great Love? The Great Love that stirs you and moves you and connects you? This is what you must receive, is the love of God, which is the movement of Knowledge. This is how God will redeem you. You have been trying to redeem yourself, but this is how God will redeem you.</p>
<p>You take everything you are doing in life, and you ask yourself, “Fundamentally, is this what I really need to be doing?” Every relationship, “Is this relationship helping me? Is it important for me now?” Everything! And you will have a deeper sense of it coming from Knowledge, way deep inside of you. Perhaps it will be a feeling. Perhaps it will be an image. Perhaps the answer will come a week from now. You have to keep asking and listening. You are asking for the Great Love to redeem you, to reunite you, and to put you in a position where your greater gifts can be realized and given to the world. And this requires that you be in certain circumstances, associated with certain people, in certain environments. If you are not in the right environment with the right people, well, the discovery will not take place. Where you are physically is very important in this regard. Who you are with is very important in this regard.</p>
<p>If your realization is going to happen in a particular city regarding certain people there and you are not in that city, well, how will the discovery take place? Even if you are in the right place, how are you going to find the right people? You can’t figure this out. This is too big for the intellect. Only Knowledge can take you there. Knowledge can bring two people from opposite ends of the world together for a greater purpose. That is the power of the Great Love. And the Great Love is what the world needs now.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on November 6, 2008<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>It is becoming evident to ever increasing numbers of people that great change is needed if humanity is to meet the challenges of its time. Great change is needed in how governments function, in how people behave and respond. Great change is needed in many organizations and institutions to adapt to a changing set of circumstances in the world.</p>
<p>For great waves of change are coming to the world, great environmental changes. You are facing a world of diminishing resources; a world whose climate has been affected, generating violent and unpredictable weather; a world where economic and political instability are increasing, and there is a growing risk of conflict and war over the remaining resources. Surely, you cannot just hold on to your preferred way of life, blind in the face of the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>Many people proclaim the need for change, but they want other people to change; they themselves do not want to really change. They want to hold on to their privileges and benefits and have more and lash out at anyone or anything they think will threaten their entitlements and their possessions.</p>
<p>There is a clamoring for change, but who will change, and what will change? People who are wealthy want to keep their wealth and have more. People who are not wealthy want wealth, and they need many practical things. And then, of course, there are vast and ever-growing numbers of people in the world who cannot even meet the daily requirements of life. They need reliable and sufficient sources of food. They need political stability. They need security. They need ethical governance. The needs are immense and growing. But you must ask yourself: Who will have to change here? And while you may point the finger at certain people or institutions, if you are really honest in your questioning, you must come down to yourself.</p>
<p>You must assess your real needs, the deeper needs within yourself, and contrast them with your preferences and your desires. If a need is genuine, it stands apart from what you simply want. There are primary needs, of course—the need for food, water, shelter, safety and security. There is the need for true companionship, a need to be engaged with other people in meaningful and productive ways. These are essential needs. They must be met or you cannot function in the world.</p>
<p>Then, of course, there is the need for a greater kind of relationship based upon what you are really here to accomplish. And that begins to move you into a higher level of needs—the need of the soul, the need to find the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you to guide you, to protect you and to lead you to a greater life within the world.</p>
<p>There are psychological needs for creativity and productivity, for recognition from others and for honest and productive communication. To meet these needs within yourself, you must change. You have basic fundamental needs, you have psychological needs, and then you have the needs of the soul. To meet these needs, you cannot be what your past has shaped you to be so far. You may want the world to change around you, and you may agitate for this, and perhaps your requests are genuine, but, fundamentally, you must change, or you cannot meet the needs of the body, the needs of the mind and the needs of the soul.</p>
<p>You cannot simply demand that the world gives you everything you think you want, for you do not even really know what you need beyond the basic requirements of life. People say they want relationship and marriage, but they are not ready. People say they want to know their true purpose in life, but they are not ready. People say they want meaningful work in the world, but they are not ready. They have not prepared for this. They cannot have these things being the way they are now; they are not ready. They have not prepared themselves. They have not undergone the real change that must occur.</p>
<p>Many people want and demand change in the world. They see a genuine need for change, but they themselves are unwilling to change. They are unwilling to re-evaluate their thinking, their behavior, their engagements, their beliefs and their attitudes. And so they agitate for change on the outside, but they themselves will not change. They are as entrenched in their position as the people they claim to oppose.</p>
<p>So you have conflict in the world by opposing parties that are entrenched in their views. They are unwilling to change. People claim they want peace, and they are working for peace, but you see, they are unwilling to question or relinquish their position that in itself makes peace impossible to achieve.</p>
<p>Even to adapt to the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world, you will really have to change the way you think, what you expect of yourself and others, how you live. Real, fundamental change here is required, just to be able to meet the changing circumstances of your life.</p>
<p>You may change leadership in your government, but that can only effect change to the degree to which people are willing to change. Policies can change in governance of the nation, but if people are unwilling to change, unwilling to accommodate change, unwilling to go through the difficulty and the transition to a different set of circumstances, well, nothing really significant will happen. And when real progress is made, it is because there is a will to change, there is an ability to change and people who are involved have to change.</p>
<p>So there is a lot of talk about change, but not a lot of real change. To be really responsible here, you must look at your life and your beliefs and your expectations and assumptions, to really see what is going to work in the real world, in the world you see today and in the change you see coming over the horizon because it is dishonest to demand change, to expect change, when you yourself are not willing to change.</p>
<p>And to say, “Well, I will change if other people change,” that is dishonest. That is placing the responsibility beyond yourself. That is dishonest. You have to change even if other people do not change. That is your commitment.</p>
<p>Real change is a change of heart—a change in the way you feel about things; a change in the way you see yourself and your life; a change not only in perception, but in what you choose to do as a result. That is the real change. Otherwise, you are facing a situation where people want to keep what they have and have more. And whether their needs are authentic or not, that is their position. And they will elect leaders to the land who they think will give them what they want even if it leads the nation to ruin.</p>
<p>And any leader who claims that they are a candidate of change really will have to ask people to change the way they see themselves and have a change of heart. Because that is the level at which real change takes place. To merely change one’s circumstances—to change where one works or lives, or even to changes one’s relationships, does not effect a change of heart. You can be married repeatedly and be the same person with the same expectations, the same issues, the same behaviors, the same judgments against others, the same attitudes against yourself. Here you are going through great effort to change your circumstances, thinking it is going to change your experience significantly, but there may be no change of heart here—a fundamental change in how you see yourself and others and what you value.</p>
<p>Without real change, people are entrenched in their position, they are a slave to their behaviors and their conditioning, and they try to get along with others who are entrenched in their positions and who are enslaved to their beliefs and social conditioning. And that gives you the world you see—a world of immense personal compromise, a world of immense tension, a world that is undergoing constant stress and that is casting humanity on a path of self-destruction. Either you will destroy yourselves through escalating conflict, or you will simply use up the world’s ability to support you because real change has not happened yet for enough people.</p>
<p>Real change happens because a deeper Knowledge within you begins to exert its influence on your daily awareness. Here a deeper mind is connecting with your surface mind, the surface mind being the mind that you live with everyday. Somehow, a deeper conscience within you has broken through the barriers and the avoidance to reach you at the surface. You are having deep feelings of regret, deeper thoughts that are shaping and changing your experience of yourself. This is not a social conscience. This is the conscience that God has placed within you. It is part of a deeper mind within you—a mind called Knowledge, a mind that is related to your ability to have profound direct experiences, a mind that will alter the course of your life.</p>
<p>When we say you are experiencing a change of heart, it means you are experiencing Knowledge within yourself, and you are being impacted by Knowledge within others. This kind of inner recognition is what really gives you the power and the awareness to change your course in life at a real level—not just at the level of appearances, but at a real level. It leads to a deeper evaluation of your thoughts, your beliefs, your attitudes, your behavior and your involvements with others. It is fundamental and it is natural. It is as if you are beginning to experience your real intelligence, your real self.</p>
<p>This begins a process where you are no longer a stranger to yourself. You are no longer living at the surface, according to what society and others expect, according to what you have been taught to believe and conditioned to do. You are beginning to have a real inner experience now, and it is a breakthrough if you can stay with it, and it will produce real change—a fundamental change—in how you experience yourself and what you choose to do with your life as a result.</p>
<p>Sometimes a dramatic and disturbing experience in life can create a change of heart. Sometimes a failure of another who is close to you, or the loss of a loved one, or the failure of your own enterprise, can create a real change of heart in you. Given normal circumstances, which is what people try to maintain, well, there may be nothing that produces a change of heart. You will just go along trying to get what you want without any real alteration of your thinking or behavior.</p>
<p>Change on the outside requires a change of heart for the individual. Perhaps dire needs will generate this. And people can act very nobly in the face of crisis, and many people do, but crisis is a very expensive way to learn, for many people fail and even perish in the face of crisis. Therefore, do not wait for crisis to create the stimulus, the motivation, to produce a change of heart within yourself, for that is a situation where many people will suffer and be lost. On a large scale, crisis is extremely expensive Instead of listening to Knowledge within yourself, you are waiting for life around you to create a shock treatment, and that is a very hazardous way of learning. But many people put off the change that even they know they must make until crisis occurs. And here the risks are very great. If humanity does not prepare for the Great Waves of change and alter the course of human behavior on a larger scale, there will be crisis. And in the face of crisis on this scale, many people will be lost; man y people will perish. It is a very reckless and expensive way to learn.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is more intelligent to learn without paying such huge prices, or requiring others to pay such huge prices. Knowledge within you can guide you through every turn if you will learn to listen and learn to follow and learn to distinguish Knowledge from the other voices in your mind—the voice of fear, the voice of desire, the voice of your culture, the voice of accommodation, the voice of compromise, the voice of condemnation. There is only one true voice within you. Do not wait until your life is in crisis to change things that you know you must change and have known you must change. For if you wait until the bitter end, then you will be forced to do things and will have very few choices, and the cost will be immense. And you will have to pay huge prices to do things that you could have known and foreseen far sooner, without paying these kinds of prices. </p>
<p>To change before change is forced upon you requires a change of heart, a kind of shift within yourself—a shift away from living only at the surface of your mind, constantly preoccupied, constantly busy, constantly caught up in your desires, fears and judgments of others—to learn to listen to the deeper current of your life, which is speaking to you all the time.</p>
<p>A change of heart also means a change in what you will listen to within yourself and in other people. Out in the world, there is a lot of talking going on, but not much listening. People do not experience the real communication that is occurring. They choose to remain unaware of the great needs around them. They choose to live at the surface so that they do not feel pain or discomfort. They live at the surface so they do not feel they have to take any greater responsibilities in life, or effect any change in their thinking or their circumstances. They want the world to change, but they do not want to change. The problem with only wanting the world to change is that there are other people who disagree with you. Perhaps they want the world to change in a different way, or they do not want to have things changed that you want to have changed. So now you are in opposition with others. Now, if you become more deeply involved, you have to deal with struggling with others who feel threatened by your desire for change, who feel they will be deprived or diminished because of the change that you want to effect, and so you have opposition.</p>
<p>To reach real cooperation, there must be a change of heart. For people to really make sacrifices to bring about things that are obviously necessary requires a change of heart. It requires the presence and the power of Knowledge. It requires a recognition of what is really occurring and the risks and hazards of not responding to a genuine set of needs.</p>
<p>Here everyone must provide a greater service to the world and to find ways of providing this without generating war. Here people must listen to others, even others who disagree with them, to hear what the other person is really asking for and what they are really concerned about. If you both want the same thing but use different words or have different ideas about how it can be achieved, you must listen to this. This is very important.</p>
<p>Don’t expect other people to have a change of heart if you have not had a change of heart. Don’t require of others what you yourself are unwilling to do. Don’t ask others to change if you are unwilling to change. And here you must be willing to change even if they are not willing to change. That is what will give you the power and the integrity to really re-evaluate your life and to discern a greater direction for yourself.</p>
<p>All of the energy that goes into judgment and condemnation, complaint, outrage against others, is energy lost and wasted, energy that could have been brought into a deeper evaluation of your life and a refocusing on what you yourself must do. People are losing so much of their life force through complaint and through whining when they themselves are unwilling to make the kind of personal changes and sacrifices that will be necessary to be a force for change in the world. People are losing their power and their potency over behaviors that produce nothing of value.</p>
<p>It is easier to criticize than it is to create. It is easier to demand and expect things to happen than it is to make things happen. To give yourself at this level, this requires a change of heart—the things that you really value, that you really feel are important. You are going to have to go out and make some things happen. You are going to have to effect some change in your own life and circumstances. You are going to have to break free of relationships that aren’t going anywhere, with people who do not share a deeper inclination and a deeper direction that you are now discovering for yourself. You are going to have to give up the perceived benefits and compromises that hold you back and keep you right where you are.</p>
<p>What drives you to do this and gives you the power to do this is the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself, for it is not afraid. It is not compromised. It is not a product of your social conditioning. It is the great endowment from God. Whether you are religious in your thinking or not, Knowledge lives within you. Whether you adhere to a religious tradition or not, Knowledge lives within you. It is the power that God has given you to find your true direction in life, and to experience this will generate a change of heart—a real change within you.</p>
<p>Here you are not merely wanting, expecting, demanding and complaining, you are putting yourself to the task of finding and following a deeper and more profound direction in life. You are serving those things you know you must serve. Without the mere intention of enriching yourself or giving yourself prestige or dominance over others, you are serving from a pure motivation. And this gives you strength, and this gives you determination, and this gives you perseverance of a kind that personal ambition alone could never provide. Personal ambition is driven by circumstances, but Knowledge is driven by a Greater Power.</p>
<p>While you recognize the need for change in the world around you—the need to change in how people live, the change in government, change in how people use the world, change in how people behave according to each other, you must really look at yourself. Are you living the life you were meant to live? Are you really being honest with yourself about what you are doing regarding your activities and involvements with others? Are your relationships built on a firm foundation and upon a real resonance with one another? Are you engaged in work that will be sustainable into the future, given the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world? Are you overusing the resources of the world? What is your relationship there? Are you honestly engaged with the primary people of your life or are these relationships only established for convenience and for personal benefit? Now you are getting down to the real questions, for which there are no immediate answers necessarily because you must live with the questions for the answer to reveal itself and for you to find the strength to respond to what you are seeing and knowing. This requires real work. It is not an activity that can be carried on by the lazy or the indolent.</p>
<p>Here even the world is demanding a change of heart. The Great Waves of change are demanding a change of heart. Your compromised circumstances, your unfulfilling relationships, your poor mental and physical health—they are all demanding a change of heart. They are all encouraging you to come to Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>When someone really has a change of heart, it is a remarkable thing. Something important has occurred. Knowledge is emerging in the individual. They are undergoing a long and confusing process of changing their focus and changing the source of authority within themselves. Changing from their wandering desires and their social conditioning to a deeper power and presence and to a deeper conscience within themselves.</p>
<p>Now a person begins to awaken. Now they see that they are really here to do something; and they must go find out what that is; and they must look at where they are losing energy through mindless behavior, through relationships that lack a greater purpose, through meaningless involvements and through self-destructive behaviors. Now they really have to collect themselves, to regain their strength, to build a focus, to mount the effort that will be required to do what is before them to do. Now they must become sober regarding their desires and their fantasies. They begin living a real life.</p>
<p>This is what redemption looks like in the individual. Redemption is not simply changing your beliefs. It is not simply adopting a different social posture or political viewpoint. That is not redemption. Redemption is a change of heart at a fundamental level. It is, in essence, bringing your intellect into service to Knowledge within yourself because Knowledge is how God influences you, so you are bringing yourself to God in the most primary and genuine way.</p>
<p>Even if you are not religious, even if you do not attend a church, a temple or a mosque, you are now beginning to honor what God has placed within you. And you are willing to follow and to find out what this means and where it will take you in life.</p>
<p>This is a real change of heart. Here instead of judging and avoiding others, you begin to discern why they are the way they are and the circumstances that have led them to behave the way they behave. And you see that instead of judgment and condemnation, this deeper recognition shows you the importance of following Knowledge within yourself, the importance of undergoing a real change of heart. Without this, people will just continue being the way they are until something happens to them. And what happens to them might evoke a change of heart, or it might simply destroy them, either slowly or immediately.</p>
<p>If you look at the world compassionately, it will generate a change of heart. It will evoke this deeper conscience, this deeper Knowledge within you, a deeper feeling for yourself and for life and a deeper regard for others. This takes you beyond the realm of ideas, beliefs, concepts. It takes you into a deeper experience, begins to open your heart to yourself and to others. Instead of just judging and evaluating, you begin to feel the condition of other people. You are moved by their courage, and you are moved by their compromise and their dilemmas. You are moved by their achievements and by their suffering. You cease to be cold, remote and calculating. This is a change of heart. This is the real change. It must happen in you. Do not demand or expect it of others if it is not happening in you. And if it is happening in you, you must give it your attention. You must be there with it.</p>
<p>This is real change. Otherwise, society can be rearranged, different groups can come to power, revolutions can take place, lives will be lost, crises will occur, but in a sense, the real fundamental change has not necessarily occurred. A breakthrough has not happened. You are just simply living under different circumstances. Your circumstances have changed, but you have not changed.</p>
<p>What really produces change is a change of heart in the individual and in enough people to generate a greater movement, a shift in values, the willingness to cooperate and to work for something important for the mutual benefit of everyone. All great movements in politics and in cultures have been the product of this change of heart. All the great compassionate activities of humanity—the commitment to restore the natural world, the commitment to meet great challenges in life, the commitment to serve those in need—this all comes as a result of a change of heart.</p>
<p>Here you are willing to see things, know things and do things that other people do not see, do not know and do not do. Here you are willing to take on greater responsibilities instead of avoiding responsibilities. Here you become really engaged in the world instead of holding yourself back. Here you are put in a position of service to the world, rather than just using it as a resource to fulfill your desires and your fantasies. It is like living a completely different life. It is a life that gives you such great satisfaction and value and connection to yourself and to others. Such a different life than simply being lost in your ideas, unknown to yourself and unknown to others, a life of calculated behavior, a life constantly trying to outperform or outmaneuver others to get what you want. You can see here where corruption emerges and how it is fostered and built. And you can see here also where it is confronted and undone.</p>
<p>Seen from a greater perspective, it is all about Knowledge—the results of connecting with Knowledge and the results of not connecting with Knowledge, the results of living according to concepts and a life lived at a deeper more profound level. It is easy to become jaded about the world; it is easy to be critical and condemning of others. It is easy, and that is why many people do this. But it is more challenging and more difficult to look beneath the surface, to take the time to really understand why certain things are happening and to explore how they can be resolved.</p>
<p>You give yourself to this greater involvement because there has been a change of heart. You can commit yourself to serving in the world and to being in deep relationship with others because there has been a change of heart. You can become a force for good in the world, a person who inspires others, a person who is a real asset to your community because there has been a change of heart.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line your conscience took the place of your ideas. You made a deeper connection within yourself. You felt the power and the presence of Knowledge. You recognized something was really wrong, and you were going to commit yourself to its resolution. No longer just a critical observer of life, now you are a participant. Now you are engaged. And if your engagement is governed and motivated by the greater intelligence that God has given you, you will be compassionate, and you will be willing to reconsider your ideas and your beliefs in the face of the real needs of the world around you.</p>
<p>This is what the world needs. It needs people who are driven and guided by this Greater Power. This is what you need—to become who you are and to fulfill your greater destiny in the world, a destiny that was determined before you came here. This is what you need to meet the deeper and more profound need of your soul.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on January 29, 2009<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>You are destined to meet certain people in life. You have a rendezvous with them. They will be guided to meet you as you are being guided to meet them. These relationships are really not based upon past worldly experience, but are a part of a Plan that was established before you came into the world, a Plan that has been created to make it possible for you to discover higher purpose in your life. God knows you cannot recognize and carry out this purpose alone, for it is remarkable and distinct from anything else in the world. It will defy definition and comparison, for it is guided by a Greater Power and a greater wisdom.</p>
<p>But you cannot find this purpose on your own. You can only prepare a way for it. You can only prepare your mind and your circumstances for this greater purpose to emerge. As it begins to emerge, it will change the way you see yourself and the world around you.</p>
<p>Relationships are the means, but they are also the reward. For nothing can really be done alone in the world. Even if you are working alone and living alone in isolation, whatever you could create is still a joint process. It is the process of uniting your mind with other minds—in this case, minds who are beyond the visible range—to produce something of greater meaning and significance.</p>
<p>This is what the athlete seeks in attaining a greater strength and ability. This is what the musician seeks in allowing the creative process to flow through them. This is what everyone seeks in their search for meaning in the world, a search that can only really be fulfilled by the greater purpose that has sent them here in the first place.</p>
<p>You cannot undertake even the preparation for your greater purpose alone, for you will need others who can support it and recognize its value in you. These are unique relationships. They are not established for convenience. They are not established to fulfill your ambitions or your fantasies. They have a greater role to play, a role that is essential for you to find the strength to honor what you most deeply know. It provides relationships of both a temporary and a permanent nature.</p>
<p>Here temporary relationships are like signposts, pointing the way, reminding you that you have a greater responsibility in life. Here people come into your life temporarily to stimulate Knowledge within you, or to provide an essential piece of wisdom that you need in order to proceed. You may have many of these relationships over time, and each one will play a part in helping you to discern your way and to find the strength to travel in that direction, which is a pathway that diverges from what everyone else is doing.</p>
<p>Then you will have relationships that are more permanent, particularly as you advance and gain greater clarity and strength, and are able to break free from your former commitments and obligations and as you are able to recognize your own fantasies and disposition in relationships.</p>
<p>Here you are beginning to approach rendezvous points with people who will play an even greater role in your life, but just because you have a destiny together does not mean that you will find one another. For there are many things in life that can hold you back. There are many hazards that can prevent you from making your rendezvous. There are many decisions that can turn your life into a different direction.</p>
<p>So you may in the end reach the rendezvous point and find that there are others who did not make it. They gave their life away back there somewhere, and in some cases, they even lost their life. This is a real problem, you see, because they hold part of the mission, the mission of which you are a part. And if enough of them do not arrive, it will put your mission in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Here all you can do is to do your part as fully as possible and pray for those that you are destined to meet—or even for those who are not ready to do their parts—to follow the power of Knowledge within themselves, the deeper intelligence that God has placed within them to guide them, to protect them and to lead them to this sacred rendezvous.</p>
<p>People think of their greater purpose as something that they will create for themselves, that will meet what they think will make them happy and what they believe will fulfill them. But without Knowledge as your guide and counsel, these estimations will be incorrect and in most cases will lead your life in a very different direction, away from where you need to go and away from the sacred rendezvous that you are meant to have with those who are here to share your greater purpose with you.</p>
<p>So often people marry and give their life away before they know what they are doing, before they have any real sense that they have a greater direction and a greater pathway to follow. And as their rendezvous approaches, they become ever more agitated and anxious and uncomfortable, sensing that there is somewhere else that they need to be that is different from where they are.</p>
<p>If you are not following your real pathway in life, you will always be uncomfortable, and this agitation and uncertainty will haunt you because in your heart you know you are not going where you need to go, you are not doing what you need to be doing, and your life is not moving where it needs to move. Here no amount of pleasure or distraction or therapy can allay this discomfort, for it is a sign that your life has a destiny and that you must follow this destiny. Your commitment to this must be greater than love or money. It must be greater than the desire for wealth and security, even success as the world defines it.</p>
<p>Everyone is called, but few are responding. If you do not respond, eventually you will just become lost in the world, and rich or poor your life will have a desperate quality—a sense of failure, a deep and abiding frustration. If you miss too many signs and signals, if you cast in doubt that which is beginning to emerge in you, eventually you will just feel lost, and even your wealth will be a kind of tragedy for you. That which was supposed to buy you happiness, contentment and freedom cannot provide any of these things.</p>
<p>Beyond the needs of the body and the needs of the intellect, there is the need of the soul. The need of the soul can only be fulfilled by carrying out your greater purpose in life and by making your rendezvous with those individuals who share this purpose and who will play a part in its discovery and expression.</p>
<p>There is no guarantee that everyone will arrive. And it is a miracle for those who do arrive because they have had to follow something inexplicable to find their way there. They have had to overcome their self-doubt and the persuasions of others to make this sacred rendezvous. They have had to trust something that perhaps no one else in their life trusted or valued. They have had to give their support to their own integrity and to their own sense of what is really right and correct for them.</p>
<p>The world is always seeking to persuade you to want something, to need something and to be something that does not represent your deeper nature. This distorting influence affects everyone to varying degrees. Even people who rebel against the values of their culture are still governed by these values. So just being a rebel is not enough, for until you discover a greater direction and a deeper voice within yourself, you are still being controlled by your social conditioning, whether you embrace it or whether you reject it. There is no freedom here.</p>
<p>Here you enter the wilderness. You leave the well-trodden path that everyone is traveling on, and you embark on a different and more mysterious course in your life. This is the path that all the great saints and contributors to humanity have had to travel, and they have had to travel without the general approval of their family and friends. They have had to travel without a consensus of approval from the world around them. They have had to travel without hostility, without condemning others and without rejecting the world at large. For it is this world that you will have to serve in the future, so if you reject it blindly, then you will not be in a position to serve it wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>Rendezvous is what everyone is searching for unconsciously in their desire for companionship, for love and for relationship. Here the needs of the mind, many of which are really not authentic to begin with, compete and obscure the deeper need of the soul. People do not realize that the need itself is genuine and authentic. At a deeper level, it is fundamental to your success and to the value of your life and your fulfillment here.</p>
<p>But people are impatient. They want companionship now. They want sexual fulfillment now. They want to fulfill the expectations of society by having families now. They are unwilling to wait. They are afraid if they wait, then the rendezvous will never happen. So people act prematurely. They marry before they are ready. They have children before they are ready. They commit their lives to careers before they are ready. The time they have earlier in life to explore and to experience the deeper current of their life is often lost to other pursuits, overlaid by other ambitions or cut short altogether by the demands and expectations of others, and by their own impatience.</p>
<p>Here individuals who have a great contribution to make to the world end up living lives that are far too insufficient for their real nature. And, of course, the justifications are everywhere, and the rationalization is everywhere. But when people assume lives that do not represent their real nature and purpose, they will always be frustrated there. If they do not begin their journey towards Knowledge, they will become ever more aberrant in their behavior and even self-destructive, in extreme cases. And their partners will not understand their behavior or the nature of their discontent.</p>
<p>So people try to offset this with hobbies, sports and very obsessive behaviors. Or they take to drugs and alcohol, trying to ward off the feeling that grows over time that they are really not where they need to be, doing what they need to be doing. They have overcommitted themselves, and others are depending upon them to maintain their current focus and behavior. And so the inner conflict grows. If a person began their journey really searching for the deeper current of their life, these mistakes would become much more rare and difficult to make.</p>
<p>So in the end people miss their rendezvous. Even if they are very successful in life and have attained what the culture values, they will feel inadequate. They will feel a sense of failure, a sense of remorse. You cannot change this through dialogue, or through therapy or through what you tell yourself because your deeper nature is your deeper nature. And because you have a greater purpose in life that is inherent and intrinsic to you, you really cannot change this. The deeper orientation that this creates in you is something you cannot explain away or deny without generating increasing conflict and confusion within yourself.</p>
<p>And it is not enough to believe in God or to worship God. For if you cannot follow what God has given you to follow, if you cannot follow the deeper Knowledge that God has placed within you to guide you, then your prayers and your prostration really are not authentic. You can ask God for favors, you can ask God to rescue you from your dilemmas great and small, but somehow you never made your rendezvous with God. Your rendezvous with God is your rendezvous with Knowledge within yourself, for that is where God speaks to you. That is where you reconnect with the Source of your life.</p>
<p>Yet the problem exists whether you are religious or not. Here religion itself can mask a deeper frustration and lack of fulfillment. Belief in religious teachings, religious principles or religious beliefs can mask and seem to displace the fundamental responsibility that you have to respond to the power and presence of Knowledge within yourself. If you do not respond to this power and presence, you will become a slave to other forces, and your sense of freedom and your sense of well-being and fulfillment will all falter and fade away.</p>
<p>Ultimately this is a question about Separation itself. Those who believe that Separation is real and that they really can fulfill themselves through their ideas, their beliefs and their ambitions, do not recognize that they still have a fundamental relationship with God, with the Creator of all life. You can argue endlessly against this relationship and this sense of purpose, but you cannot eradicate it. It will go with you wherever you go. You can never shake it off because you can never really separate yourself from God. You can never really separate yourself from life.</p>
<p>So the more willful you are, the harder you try to satisfy your inner needs through outer activities and the more you give yourself to your pursuits, to your hobbies and to your ambitions, the more you fortify yourself against this fundamental rendezvous that you have with Knowledge within yourself.</p>
<p>Here you cannot make a deal. You cannot bargain with God and say, “Well, I will give a little bit of my life to what you want, if I can get what I want.” There is no bargaining here. You cannot bargain with the Lord of the Universe. You cannot bargain with the power of Knowledge within yourself. People who think this way think that both God and Knowledge are somehow resources for their personal use, to be called upon when needed, to be employed when needed, like you would call the police department or the fire department if you had a problem.</p>
<p>This is such a gross miscalculation. It is tragic in its consequences because people end up valuing what has little or no value, and missing that which has the ultimate value. They choose people who will fortify their beliefs and who seem to substantiate their beliefs. So even here their relationships are working against them.</p>
<p>You cannot undo the fact that you were sent here for a greater purpose. You may think it is a violation of your free will, but free will is only a gift given to you so that you can discover what is really true and important within yourself, and so that you can make this discovery on your own without it being forced upon you by some greater external power. People who believe in Separation find this unappealing. They think it violates their freedom. They think it is kind of a divine dictatorship in the Universe. They see this as an imposition and not as the gift of redemption that it really is.</p>
<p>So there are fundamental problems in people’s approach. But ultimately the question is, can you make your real rendezvous with Knowledge and with those who are here to be a part of a greater purpose that is emerging in your life? This is what you will reflect upon once you leave this life and return to your spiritual family, your learning group. They will not be interested in your hobbies and fascinations. They will not be interested in your tragedies or your mistakes, your lost romances or your failed economic adventures. They will not be interested in your psychopathology, or in the unique features of your former personality. They will only be interested in whether you made the sacred rendezvous with Knowledge and with the others who were sent to meet you. They will look at you and they will say, “Were you successful?” And you will be unable to misrepresent the truth to them, for beyond the world, deception in relationship is almost impossible.</p>
<p>That is all that will matter. The vast majority of things that are important to you now or that preoccupy you now will not matter in the end. They will ask, “Did you make your rendezvous? Did you achieve what you were sent into the world to achieve?” And you will have to tell them the truth because it will be self-evident to everyone. And from that position, you will be able to see clearly, without distortion.</p>
<p>So what can you do then, but return to try again. There is no “judgment day”, where if you failed in one life you go to everlasting hell. This is a purely human invention. But the consequences of not finding your purpose and trying to live without it are very real and are evident every day in your thinking, in your demeanor, your behavior and your experience. Without this purpose, you are living a kind of hell—a hell that is beautiful, but a hell where you can never be happy, where you are never really at ease with yourself because you have not been honoring your deeper nature.</p>
<p>Knowledge is here to move your life in a specific direction, but if you are not going in that direction, or have not gone in that direction, there is discomfort. But this discomfort does not call for denial or avoidance. It calls for recognition and resolution. This is why God does not condemn. God only attracts and employs. The whole notion of hell is humanity’s attempt to punish those that it cannot accept, and use God as the punisher. It is to exact revenge. It is a tool of the intellect to punish other intellects, or to force them to believe, to coerce them to believe in acceptance and consensus.</p>
<p>You have a sacred rendezvous with Knowledge through a set of encounters that will alter the course of your life and reveal to you a deeper nature and a deeper reality that goes beyond your ideas about yourself, your personality and your personal history—a recognition that is beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect.</p>
<p>Then you have a rendezvous with other individuals. Some of them will be very brief, with those who come into your life momentarily to remind you of something, to teach you something or to speak to something deep within you that needs to be refreshed and renewed.</p>
<p>Then you have a rendezvous with those who will take up a greater position in your life, who are here to serve a greater capacity that they are only beginning to recognize within themselves. Those who make this rendezvous will play such a great part in your life and will stand in contrast to every other relationship that you have tried to establish for yourself.</p>
<p>If you can meet these individuals, it will make all the difference for you, and you will realize that what you have been trying to follow is very real and that you will not take this journey alone. To get up this mountain—particularly as you reach its steeper places—you will need a great companionship. Perhaps one of these people will be your husband or your wife. Perhaps it will be a person who is sharing your greater work. Perhaps it will be a teacher who is here to encourage you to continue and to keep continuing. It can even be one of your children, who somehow recognizes your deeper nature and whose life is united with yours in expressing something unique and important in the world.</p>
<p>The relationship can take many different forms. But should you make this rendezvous, it will be evident that your relationship is really about something else, beyond the normal parameters of human relationships. It is speaking to something deeper and greater. It is mysterious. It has a more sacred and profound content. It is something that exists beyond the realm of the intellect, so it defies definition. Your words and your attempts to describe it can only be approximations. These are holy relationships, holy in their purpose and in their deeper nature.</p>
<p>This does not mean in the rendezvous that everyone will understand why they are together. Perhaps this understanding will be very partial. But there will be a sense of a greater connection. And this greater connection is really not about the past as much as it is about the present and the future.</p>
<p>Once the rendezvous has occurred at this level, there is no assurance of success because you still have to contend with your own social conditioning, your own worldly nature and all the problems involved in establishing yourself and maintaining yourself in life. The rendezvous is not the end point, but the beginning and an initiation of the next stage of your life.</p>
<p>Here the great burden you have been carrying for so long begins to find expression in your life and in these relationships particularly, and you feel grateful and relieved. You feel renewed and reassured that you really are following something important, that you are not deceiving yourself and that there really is a greater power and a greater reality to your life. These relationships will give testimony to this. They will bear witness to this. The Mystery will be with you and between you—a mystery that you cannot define, but which you must learn to rely upon and to value above all things.</p>
<p>Your relationship with God will always be mysterious. You can never confine it within a set of beliefs, principles or a teaching. That is to put it in a tomb. It is always alive and dynamic. It is always illuminating your life and drawing you towards certain things and away from other things, like a great beacon drawing you homeward—out of Separation, out of the hell of your isolation, out of the irresolvable conflicts from the past, out of addiction, out of fantasy, out of seduction, out of guilt and out of failure.</p>
<p>It is an interesting thing that those who respond to this and who make the sacred rendezvous are people who have failed to fulfill themselves in the world. And they will perhaps feel they are failures. They have failed to acquire romance or wealth sufficiently. Or they have acquired these things, but have found them lacking and insufficient to their needs. So there is a sense of failure and disillusionment. But this failure and disillusionment are important. While everyone else may be avoiding failure and disillusionment, these two things prepare one to recognize a deeper reality within oneself.</p>
<p>If you have failed to make your rendezvous, later in life, if you make this discovery, there is a second redemption. And that is to give to others—to share your wealth, to share your time and to share whatever you can in service to meeting real needs of both people and of nature around you. This is the second redemption. It is not as powerful and fulfilling as the first, but it is significant and will be effective. Those who have been driven through all of their life can find themselves at the end with the opportunity to give, to be benefactors—benefactors with wealth, if they have wealth; benefactors of time, if they have time; benefactors of care, if they have the strength to do this. So there is a second redemption.</p>
<p>But what is important, particularly for younger people or people in middle age, is to focus on the great sacred rendezvous—to pray for them, to ask for them, to say to the Universe, “Whatever it takes for me to make the rendezvous, I must make the rendezvous. I must know this greater purpose that lives within me.”</p>
<p>If you are ambivalent regarding it, if you are too afraid of it, if you are too much in conflict regarding it, you will not make the rendezvous. So you must choose what you will value. And if you have gained enough wisdom in life—through success and through failure, through achievement and through disappointment—you will know how to make the right choice. You will see that the world can offer you pleasure and sorrow, but not fulfillment. That must come from somewhere else, from a Greater Reality in the Universe and a Greater Reality that lives within you, within your Knowledge.</p>
<p>There is a reason you are searching in relationships, but it is not for pleasure, wealth or ambition. It is for a deeper reason. And though you may have many failures in relationship, you will never give up because you are seeking to make the sacred rendezvous that are waiting for you and that are necessary for you and for the fulfillment and success of your life.</p>

<p>As revealed to<br />
Marshall Vian Summers<br />
on September 7, 2009<br />
in Boulder, Colorado</p>
<p>The New Message is here to give humanity great promise and strength. The power of Knowledge that God has placed within each person is the great endowment, an endowment that is waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>Humanity has not yet discovered its greater powers, its greater strength, its greater integrity and its greater ethical foundation. It is still groveling, like a primitive race, driven by greed and avarice, hatred and condemnation. It is still primitive in what it prescribes and what it adheres to. But this does not deny the fact that humanity has greater strengths and greater powers that have yet to be discovered and developed.</p>
<p>The Creator of all life has sent a New Message into the world to prepare humanity for the Great Waves of change that are coming to the world and to prepare humanity for its encounter with a universe full of intelligent life. But this preparation also requires that humanity recognize and cultivate its greater strengths and its greater integrity.</p>
<p>But humanity cannot be taught or prepared all at once, for the instruction happens at the level of the individual, at the level of the person. To bring an individual into awareness of that individual’s greater strengths and greater powers and greater integrity is where the seeds will be planted and where humanity’s promise resides. Therefore, do not think of what all people should do, or you will always be disappointed and discouraged. Think instead of what is before you.</p>
<p>Your societies and cultures may only want you to be a pacified consumer, a pacified worker, a member of the group, a subscriber to the culture’s values and priorities. But you have a greater promise in life, a greater promise that is assured because it is part of your deeper nature. In culture, your deeper nature is forgotten and overlooked and, in some cases, denied entirely. But you cannot deny your deeper nature forever, for it lives within you beyond the reach of culture, beyond the reach of corruption and beyond the reach of manipulation and deception. That is why it is your greater strength and holds for you your greatest abilities and indeed your greater purpose for coming into the world.</p>
<p>What was reserved previously only for the elite, for the adept, must now become an open door for you and for other peoples of the world. For the world is facing its greatest trials, its greatest dangers. Humanity is unprepared for the Great Waves of change. Humanity is ignorant and foolish regarding its views and attitudes toward the prospect of intelligent life in the universe. So the promise of humanity is the promise of the individual, the awakening of the person. It is this that will give humanity a greater core strength and a greater possibility to exercise real wisdom in the face of such an unpredictable and uncertain future.</p>
<p>For a person to respond to God’s Revelation, they must recognize at the outset that they cannot fulfill themselves given the usual habits, diversions and enjoyments that people around them are so deeply invested in. They must realize they have a greater need and a greater responsibility in life. This will be demonstrated at the outset by their suffering and their discouragement with the world around them as they gradually lose interest in the games and hobbies of people around them because they have a deeper need that is now emerging.</p>
<p>If they have satisfied the needs of the body through food, clothing, shelter and security; if they have satisfied the needs of the mind through the availability of education and opportunity, then the greater need will begin to arise within them. This is the need of the soul, which can only be fulfilled by recognizing, accepting and fulfilling your greater purpose for coming here—which is something that resides entirely beyond the realm and the reach of the intellect. You cannot figure it out, but you can and must experience it. And it is waiting to be discovered.</p>
<p>To be a person of the New Message, you must realize that humanity is entering a new era and a tremendously powerful and uncertain threshold. You cannot simply rely upon ancient teachings or ancient prescriptions or ancient prophecies now to guide you into a new future. For the world has changed and is changing rapidly, but people have not changed with it and do not see the need to change. The person of the New Message then must recognize that they are standing at the threshold of a monumental shift in the reality of the world, in the conditions of life here and in the discovery that your isolation in the universe is over, and you will never have it again.</p>
<p>The pressure here will be great, but it is pressure for a purpose. It is leading you to the most profound discovery you can ever have in life, and that is the discovery of the power and presence of Knowledge within you—a deeper mind, a greater mind, a mind that is committed and focused, a mind that is not distracted or dissuaded by the world, a mind that is pure and uncorrupted, a mind that has been undefiled by the world in all of its inducements and tragedies.</p>
<p>The New Revelation speaks of this because humanity must gain access to its greater strengths, greater powers and greater integrity. If it does not do this, it will fail in the face of the Great Waves of change, and it will be overtaken through guile and deception by forces from the universe who are here to take advantage of a weak and divided humanity.</p>
<p>Because of the great danger for human civilization and for the well-being and freedom of the human family, the Creator of all life has sent a New Message into the world, a Revelation as great as any of the Revelations that have been sent here. It is here in a pure form, uncorrupted by governments, undefiled by ambitious individuals, unwedded to culture and politics and the lower intentions of humanity.</p>
<p>The person of the New Message realizes they are living at a time of Revelation, a time where this Revelation is so greatly needed as people all around them—even in positions of power in government—seem to be unresponsive to the signs of the world and to the emergence of great change.</p>
<p>The individual’s ability to undergo the preparation, to gain access to the power of Knowledge and to follow this faithfully—without trying to control or manipulate this greater intelligence—is a tremendous challenge and opportunity. Yet it represents redemption for the individual because it is through Knowledge that you reconnect with God, that you rediscover that you have a greater purpose in life and are able to follow the steps of its revelation, a personal revelation.</p>
<p>Here you realize that you are a pioneer. You are doing something new. You are at the very outset of a great movement, a great shift. As a pioneer, you will have to face the loneliness and the lack of recognition from others. You will have to build your own strength and bond closely with others who are responding to the Revelation.</p>
<p>Here you realize that you do not have an answer for the future, and you do not have an answer for your life, for your answers are all the answers that culture has given you. Even the answers that you feel you have created are still the answers that others have provided. But there is only one answer, and that is to prepare for a Great Waves world. It is to prepare your life and your mind to serve at a higher capacity. It is to undergo a great preparation that you did not invent for yourself, but which has been given to you through Grace and through Providence.</p>
<p>Here you break the chains of addiction, the need for approval and the adherence to culture and to the dictates of your nation, to bond and unite with the Greater Power and force that is the Source of all life in the Universe. You do this with humility, and you do not proclaim yourself, for you know the Greater Power is not yours to own or to use or to control. But you are blessed to receive it and allow it to reshape your life and your direction so that real fulfillment and satisfaction may become available to you.</p>
<p>You prepare, then, to be a man or a woman of Knowledge—not just for your own redemption and fulfillment, but to play your part at a time of great transition. You know not the meaning of this or the importance of this. Perhaps you will think you will be a great leader, but very few people will be great leaders. You will just play a part that will take shape and form as you proceed and as your relationships with others gain greater clarification and greater honesty.</p>
<p>You are a person of a New Revelation, and you become unbound and unhindered by the past, for you are the seed bearer of the future. You are carrying the vessel of the future. It is not enough to merely live for the moment, for that is only half of the meaning of life. You must also prepare for the future, and only Knowledge within you knows what that future will be and how you can prepare for it wisely, effectively and safely.</p>
<p>The way is actually quite simple, but because it resides beyond the realm of the intellect, people can stumble and become very confused regarding it, trying to match its reality with their own current beliefs and attitudes. And of course your current beliefs and attitudes are the creation of culture and often the product of fear. They have nothing to do with the reality of your greater life. They are only the residue of the past and of an old identity, which you still carry and must learn to outgrow.</p>
<p>This outgrowing of identity is a natural thing entirely. It is like outgrowing adolescence for adulthood. As an adolescent, you identify with your age and your compatriots, and you are swayed by their values and their pursuits. But when you become an adult, your priorities change. You seek things that have greater meaning and value, and you assume greater responsibilities in life. So it is here with outgrowing the old personal identity. You are assuming greater responsibilities, and you are seeking greater meaning. The old pursuits are seen as lacking and insufficient for your deeper needs.</p>
<p>This is growing up spiritually. This is what it means to continue to fulfill the hierarchy of needs within you. And it is this that reunites you with the world and with those who sent you here. It is here that you find your greatest fulfillment within your own integrity, within the quality of relationships that will now begin to come to you and with the sense of meaning that becomes pervasive in your life.</p>
<p>What was fleeting before now becomes more essential to your focus. Spiritual practice is not merely a form of stress release. It becomes now the central power building, the central focus of your activities. Here you bring your spiritual practice into everything that you do because it is relevant to everything that you do, and it will assist you and bring clarity in everything that you do.</p>
<p>Here there is no real sacrifice. You simply outgrow things that are seen to be lacking or even foolish, which before were so important to you. Most people never grow up spiritually, so they remain in a state of childhood or adolescence spiritually. Even though they have gray hairs and become aged physically, they never really become grown up spiritually. But the process of growth is the same—the outgrowing of the old, the emergence of the new, the growing pains of becoming a more responsible, more efficacious person, and the great opportunity of experiencing relationships at the level of higher purpose in life, which is something that is largely beyond the reach of others who have not undergone this greater development.</p>
<p>A person of the New Message realizes they are part of something greater that is emerging. They do not need to see the conclusions or the outcome, for that is beyond their reach and beyond the range of their vision. It is not their responsibility to assure an outcome, but to play their part in moving humanity in a positive direction. And how could humanity move in a positive direction without the great assistance that the Creator of all life is providing? It is tragically evident that humanity cannot do this for itself, or will not do this, whatever the case may be.</p>
<p>People pray to God for assistance, for opportunity, for deliverance, for escape from pain and suffering, for renewal or for rejuvenation. But when the Message comes in such a great form, they cannot see it, they do not respond or they deny it because it does not meet their expectations or their previous beliefs.</p>
<p>If you really want God to help you, you had better be ready to change your life. God will help you completely. If you are not sure you want this, then perhaps you should withhold your prayers and affirmations.</p>
<p>The people of the New Message must assist the Messenger while he is still in the world. His task is overwhelming. It is far beyond what one person could ever do. They must bear witness to this. They must represent this. They must have the courage to be part of the Revelation and not simply its observers or its audience.</p>
<p>The power of the Revelation to restore humanity and to prepare humanity will be based upon the actions of many people. The Revelation is pure. It is uncorrupted. It has been given completely. The Messenger has not perished with the Message half delivered. The Creator of all life made sure of this. Everything is in place.</p>
<p>The Revelation speaks to a different reality within people. It does not pander to their intellect or their intellectual pride. It is does not support their prejudices and their incomplete or incorrect thinking. It is not bound by human preference or human will, and so it seems remarkable but confounding, new and different but somehow ancient and timeless.</p>
<p>The person of the New Message must be part of the New Message. They cannot simply be a consumer who will steal it and run away and try to use it to build wealth, or personal power or personal advantage. Like thieves in the night, they will steal it and claim for themselves its power and its privilege and its authorship. You will see the attempt at this, yes, because humanity is far too corrupt as a whole to deal with something this pure, and that is why the individual is the focus and not the collective masses of people.</p>
<p>It is by people learning and living the New Message that they will be able to transfer and translate its power and wisdom into their families, their communities, their nations, their religions, everything—creating a quantum shift in human perception that will happen almost invisibly over time.</p>
<p>People will begin to consider that they are the natives of this world and must establish their own rules of engagement regarding visitation and intervention. Of course, it is so obvious. People will say, “Of course, we cannot just let anyone come here to do whatever they want. And we will not allow ourselves to be persuaded by these forces that they are here to save us or rescue us.”</p>
<p>Of course. It will be common sense at that point, but at this moment, it seems fantastic and impossible. How could it be? Because people are still thinking in a primitive way. They are still thinking like they are isolated in the universe. They are not thinking ahead. They do not see that humanity has already ravaged the world to such an extent that it will barely be able to provide for them in the future, thus creating the Great Waves of change.</p>
<p>The promise is in the individual, and this has always been the case. All new revelations, all new improvements, innovations and great steps in science, commerce and social justice have always been furthered by individuals who were inspired and committed to their service. This is how all races in the universe are advanced and have promise.</p>
<p>For the person of the New Message, they have a great responsibility here, perhaps greater than anything they have ever considered for themselves. Part of them still wants to go off and be happy and carefree somewhere, to live a kind of idyllic, irresponsible life. But deep within them there is emerging a stronger power and a deeper voice and a sense of commitment and direction that are now becoming their framework and their context.</p>
<p>They are connected to the future. They are connected to the Greater Community. They are connected to their time and to the great times to come. They are beginning to respond as if they were actually sent to the world to achieve something specific in concert with certain individuals. They are actually beginning to think and feel like immortal beings that are here to provide service in a temporary and troubled environment.</p>
<p>But to reach this awareness and the strength of this reality requires a tremendous commitment and preparation. You cannot be halfhearted in this matter. You cannot be impatient or manipulative or driven by your preferences, or you will not even be able to begin. You will be cast aside at the first challenge or impediment, the first discouragement, when you find out the people around you that you thought were so friendly and close to you really have no clue or have no interest in these matters and will turn against you should you proclaim yourself.</p>
<p>Here you realize you have a choice. You will either follow the emerging power of Knowledge, however mysterious, or you will conform to the needs and the preferences of your family or friends. Many people fail at this point, merging back into the amnesia of culture, to the addiction of culture, to the manipulation of culture. They awoke briefly, only to be subsumed by the powers in the mental environment around them, pulling them back in—into confusion, into irresponsibility, into fantasy.</p>
<p>You must now be concerned with your own calling and development and the development of others around you whom you may know, who are able to respond to a New Revelation in life. But you cannot get up this mountain if you are waiting for others. You yourself must get up this mountain, even if your greatest friends cannot go. You will do more for the world and for them if you can ascend and make this journey than you could ever do by staying behind and being encouraging.</p>
<p>There is so much wisdom and clarity to gain along the way. Much of it you cannot see at this moment, but it is awaiting you in your journey. And you cannot learn these things unless you take this journey. You cannot learn them as precepts or as ideas, for you will not be able to embody them, follow them and demonstrate them.</p>
<p>The person of the New Message is part of the New Message as a contributor, without trying to define your role or claim powers or positions for yourself. This will require a great deal of restraint on your part, for all these tendencies are still within you—the seeds of evil, the seeds of greed, the seeds of deception, the seeds of self-deception are all there. Many of them are quite active at this moment. So you will have to restrain these things and turn to Knowledge and ask the assistance of others when that becomes necessary.</p>
<p>For you do not want to lose this calling. You have come this far. You do not want to fail. You have already moved beyond the obsessions of culture to a great extent. You do not want to fail in this pursuit, the greatest opportunity you could ever have—you who are chosen and lucky and so, so fortunate to be amongst the first to receive a New Message from God.</p>
<p>Do you realize what you have before you? Do you have any idea? In your self-deprecation, can you see what is before you? God has given you a way, a path out of the jungle, the hopeless maze of human confusion and human compromise.</p>
<p>Therefore, take heart. Stay with your preparation and practice. Let the signs of the world tell you what is coming, and let the signs within yourself moderate your extreme behaviors and your harsh criticisms—without taking anything away from the self-correction that you must bring to bear in your thinking, your assumptions and your behavior. A wise teacher does not punish the student, but only offers firm correction. This is how you must be with yourself. This is how a wise and loving parent is with their young innocent child.</p>
<p>You are like a child now in developing a Greater Community awareness and discovering the power of Knowledge. You are at the early stages, and there is a greater road ahead of you. Finally, you have purpose, meaning and direction. But you must stay with this and not be waylaid by the obstacles, the distractions and the old ideas and beliefs that cloud your mind, where you lose track of the trail up the mountain. Do not be seduced by the beautiful places to reside along the way, for you have a destiny and a journey to take. And this is how God will redeem you, in a way that you could never redeem yourself.</p>
