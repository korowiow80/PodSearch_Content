The original idea was to create a newsletter. Joe convinced Tara that a website will reach the world and within 2 1/2 years of working on Visions day and night, 7 days a week, two computer workstations and countless hours invested in writing and research of paranormal phenomenon, they are one of the most respected sources of Paranormal reporting today.

      <title>Episode 180  Paranormal Cops</title>
      <description>&quot;Paranormal Cops&quot; follows a group of larger-than-life cops who walk one beat during the day as real-life Chicago-area police officers and another at night when they apply their forensic and investigative expertise to paranormal casework. Responding to the pleas of ordinary people who are victimized by distressing and inexplicable activities in their homes and workplaces, as well as taking cases from their day jobs when called upon, these cops bring their no-nonsense approach to hunting ghosts and real-life police skills to separate the fact from fiction and often happen upon results much scarier than the paranormal.</description>

      <description>We do not speculate or sensationalize, but rather approach each case from the position of scientific researchers. Our goal is to collect evidence, analyze it thoroughly and present our findings to the client in a clear and concise manner.

We are researchers above all other pursuits. We question not only &#8220;what&#8221;, but &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how&#8221;. We aim to answer such questions through scientific experimentation and the gathering of observable data.
