			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><h5><a href="http://www.arcwapodcast.org/early-nose-piercing/nose-piercing/" rel="attachment wp-att-7"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7" title="Nose-Piercing" src="http://www.arcwapodcast.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Nose-Piercing-200x92.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="92" /></a><strong>As early as 4,000 years ago noses were being pierced in the Middle East. It&#8217;s even mentioned in the Bible. Rebekah, Isaacs wife was given a gift. That gift was a nose ring, it was given on their wedding day. Indian women have been sporting nose rings since the 16th century. Nose rings have been thought to be related to female reproduction, thus reducing the pain of childbirth. It&#8217;s also believed to reduce the pain of menstruation. Nose rings also served to show beauty and to show status.</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Nose rings have been added to the American way of style. It started with the hippies, moved on to the punk rockers as a rebellion movement, and now today. Today it seems to have more of a trendy value than years ago. It&#8217;s been a symbol of love, marriage, rebellion, travel and religion. People all over the world are getting pierced in some way or another. Even celebrities, of course.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The most common piercing is though the nostril. Woman are the usual parties who have this type of piercing. This involves a hoop or a stud ring through the nostril. Septum piercings, aka bull rings are not so common and are usually found of men. Jewelry used for a septum piercing are usually <a href="http://scintillatingbodyjewelry.com">captive bead rings</a>, horse shoe rings or a straight bar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does it hurt? Yes and NO. For most people it&#8217;s about a 5-10 sharp pain, that dulls really fast. Usually when it&#8217;s finished, you sit back, and think &#8220;wow, that&#8217;s not as bad as I thought it would be&#8221;. That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s not. The imagination takes over and you are so nervous before you sit down in that chair. Imagination is the worst enemy when you decide to get something pierced. I promise. Of course, the earlobe is not bad at all, I think most people have that piercing. The further you go up your ear, to the thicker cartilage, the more &#8220;ouch&#8221; you may feel. It&#8217;s only temporary, the pain fades real fast.</strong></p>
