      <title>Episode 10 - The Arrival of Miles Regis</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1228460/600x600_2624394.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Episode 10 of &#8220;The Art of The Interview with Steven Adams&#8221;. Steve is welcomed into the home of artist Miles Regis.

Miles Regis is a self-taught, experimental painter. If you have ever wondered if, when, or how to become a full-time artist, Miles Regis' story will fascinate and inspire you.

Born in Trinidad, this artist has been greatly influenced by Caribbean artists such as Alexander King, LeRoy Clarke, Carlisle Harris, Boscoe &amp; Geoffrey Holder. Regis&#8217; paintings are distinctly Trinidadian in color and expression. 

In June of 2009, Regis' show &quot;WL4WWD4&quot; at Pounder-Kon&#233; Art Space was a complete success.

Regis&#8217; work was showcased in CNN&#8217;s &#8220;African Voices&#8221; feature on actor Isaiah Washington (link below), who collects Regis&#8217; paintings; other collectors of Miles Regis&#8217; work include actors Ron Perlman and playwright Trevor Rhone.

Regis' work will be presented in the American Rag Los Angeles show - &quot;Carnival&quot;, from Feb 11th to March 11th.  Opening Reception on February 11th, 2010 from 6 to 9

      <title>Episode 9 - The Architecture and Conceptions of Ben Ball</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1228460/600x600_2184092.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Episode 9 of &#8220;The Art of The Interview with Steven Adams&#8221;.

Steve welcomes Architect, Designer, Conceptualist - Ben Ball, of Ball-Nogues Studio.

In his current collaboration with Gaston Nogues, Benjamin Ball is exploring the intersection of architecture, art and product design through physical modeling and the use of digital and more traditional forms of production. 

A major goal of his design endeavors is to create experiences; because of this, he feels &quot;a building that is not built is not architecture.&quot;

A graduate of the Southern California Institute of Architecture, Ball logged stints at Gehry Partners and Shirdel Zago Kipnis. He has worked as a set and production designer for films (including the Matrix series) as well as music videos and commercials with such influential directors as Mark Romanek and Tony Scott. 

His experience ranges from work on the Disney Concert Hall and small residential commissions for boutique firms to complex medical structures and event design.

BALL-NOGUES STUDIO
In 2006, Ball-Nogues Studio was awarded the Best of Category distinction for Environments for their installation Maximilian's Schell by ID Magazine. Ball-Nogues is the recipient of two Los Angeles AIA Design Awards and Interior Design Magazines Best of Year Award for their installation Rip Curl Canyon.

In 2007 their installation Liquid Sky was the winner of the Museum of Modern Art / P.S.1's Young Architect's Program competition and Ball-Nogues became one three design teams who were awarded a United States Artists Target Fellowship. 

In 2008 their site specific installation Echoes Converge appeared at the 11th Venice Biennale of Architecture and an exhibit of their work appeared at the Bejing Biennale. 

The Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles will host a new installation by the team in the summer of 2009. T

      <title>Episode 7 - &quot;Commit.&quot;, Mickey &amp; Nicole Blaine, and DFFLA</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1228460/600x600_2068800.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Episode 7 of &#8220;The Art of The Interview with Steven Adams&#8221;

Steve welcomes writer-director of &quot;Commit.&quot;, Mickey Blaine and his star-producer (and wife) Nicole Blaine.

&quot;Commit.&quot; screens Tuesday, August 18 at 7:30pm in the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles.

Having know each other since their formative years, Mickey and Nicole have come together to form a bond, a family, and... an entertaining film about two people who meet and form a suicide pact.  With a two person cast, in 30 minute-uncut takes, and made only for $10k (with a little help from an alma mater), this is truly what independent cinema is about.


Keep an eye out for Mickey's webisodes of &quot;Pirate Ninja Adventure Go!&quot;, which will hit the web in September '09.

      <title>Episode 1 - Downtown, Greg Ptacek, Henry Priest, &amp; DFFLA</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1228460/600x600_2071545.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Episode 1 of &#8220;The Art of The Interview with Steven Adams&#8221;

This is the first episode in a series of podcasts dedicated to the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles.

In Episode 1, Steven interviews Greg Ptacek and Henry Priest, board members and prime movers of the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles (http://www.dffla.com/).

Greg Ptacek is no stranger to festivals and the business, having worked in the industry as journalist, publicist, and having been one of the key people involved in the creation of the Silverlake Film Festival.

Henry Priest - wrestler, teacher, actor, East Sider, and creator of the American Latino Film Festival - is a complete renaissance man.

Greg and Henry breakdown how DFFLA is more than just great films, it is an immersion into the life, the culture, the architecture - new and old, and so much more of downtown Los Angeles.  They also give you insight to the 12 days of programming and themes of the films, parties, restaurants, and events that comprise DFFLA.


The Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles runs from August 12 - 22, 2009.
