<p> Lamisil is often thought of as a topical cream by consumers, but it is
actually a white powder that can be mixed into a cream or powder.
This medication is used to treat many different skin infections such
as jock itch, athlete√≠s foot, and other types of fungal infections
such as ringworm that may affect people.</p>

<p> This medication has been on the market for quite some time, but in
2007 it was approved for generic production when the patent for
exclusivity expired. During the same year the FDA noted that Lamisil
was approved for the treatment of fungal infections in children from
the age of four and up.  In the case of children, the FDA recommends
that granules are actually sprinkled on the food of children to treat
ringworm of the scalp, which is especially difficult to treat through
other methods. <a href=http://www.ipadnation.org/>Lamisil online</a></p>
<p> Lamisil may cause some unwanted side effects. These side effects may
include but are not limited to diarrhea, constipation, fullness,
indigestion, flatulence, headaches, vertigo, raised liver enzymes,
decreased white blood cell counts, depression, anxiety, and even
insomnia.  Patients should speak to their doctors about side effects,
to determine if Lamisil is the best medication for them or if another
course of treatment would be more suitable.</p>
