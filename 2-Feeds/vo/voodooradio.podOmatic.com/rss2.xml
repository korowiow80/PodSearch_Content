&quot;CHRONICLES OF THE GECKO BROTHERS&quot; vintage vol 1..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

THIS IS A HEART FELT LETTER TO FRIENDS, FAMILY, SUCKAS AND CONSUMERS.
CHRONICLES OF THE GECKO BROTHERS IS A MIXTAPE (AND I DO MEAN MIXTAPE)
MAPPING WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO. FOR INSTANCE THE LACK OF SUBSTANCE IN MUSIC THAT HAS
THE YONGER GENERATION MORE LOST THAN MY GENERATION. THE INDUSTRY
CONSOLIDATING TO SALVAGE WHATS LEFT AFTER PUTTING OUT GARBAGE
BRAINWASHING THE CONSUMER INTO BELIEVING THAT THE MUSIC THAT THEY'RE
HEARING WAS HOT. WHEN NAS SAID HIP HOP IS DEAD WAS HE TALKING ABOUT ITS SOUL?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

THIS CD WAS COMPRISED OF FREESTYLES THAT I DID IN THE COURSE OF 2007
AND WAS PLAYED ON VARIOUS OUTLETS I.E. MYSPACE, BLACKPLANET, THE RADIO,
INTERNET RADIO, SATILITE ETC....... MIXED BY MARC X UNEEK THIS CD HAS NO HOST
2 FEATURES THAT I'M VERY THANKFUL THAT THEY JUMPED ON IT WHEN I ASKED
AND THEY DID THE DAMN THING. SO I WOULD LIKE TO THANK PRIME STATUS
AND NAMELESS I LOVE YA'LL *****. THERE WAS OTHERS THAT I REACHED
OUT TO BUT NEVER HIT ME BACK, HOWEVER CALLED WHEN THEY NEED THEIR
RECORD PLAYED. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THOSE THAT REPLIED BACK WITH FEEDBACK AND TO THOSE THAT DIDN'T BOTHER THATS OK I KNOW YA'LL WAS
BUSY SO THANKS ANYWAY.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

THIS CD IS RECORDED VINTAGE WISE AS IF WAS RECORDED ON AN ANALOG 8 TRACK
RECORDER FOR A WARM FEEL BECAUSE WE WAS SINCERE WHEN WE WERE RECORDING
THIS. SO PLEASE TAKE TIME OUT OF YOUR SCHEDULE AND DOWNLOAD THIS MIXTAPE
AND FEEL FREE TO WRITE ME BACK AND LET ME KNOW WHAT THE DEAL IS......
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
THIS IS FOR THE DJ, CONSUMER AND FOR LABEL REPS!
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TEACHING ME
EMBRASSING MARC X AND I
AND NOT GIVING UP THE LOVE OF JUST MUSIC!

Born in Washington D.C. and raised in Silver springs and Potomac, Maryland and later Kansas City. Recently Sophia moved to Los Angeles to further her acting career.

In her teenage years, Sophia started modeling by working at bikini shows, hair shows, fashion shows at malls, special event and car shows. She was then introduced into DJ'ing by DJ Shaunflo, as she would be his back-up and relief DJ at parties and clubs. &quot;Since I love music just as much that I thought it would be pretty hot to have a girl DJ!,&quot;Sophia smiles. Her original DJ name was 'DJ Sofiyah,' as in hot like fiyah!&quot;

As she got older, priorities changed and Sophia concentrated on working and school. She finished school and attained her real estate license with Keller Williams.

But the spotlight lured Sophia back in and she started &quot;shadow dancing&quot; (behind a screen) at Voodoo Nightclub at Harrah's Casino. Soon Sophia worked as gogo dancer at every club in the Kansas City area. &quot;I'm one of the OG's (original gangsters) of the gogo scene in the Midwest,&quot; Sophia says. As she worked in the clubs Sophia realized her old passion to DJ. &quot;So I said wait, I know how to DJ and I love it!&quot; So she revived her DJ career and decided that she needed to change her name up, &quot;&#8230;Kinda like how many times Prince and P.Diddy did! So I chose 'DJ Hustle-Lin' because it had my last name 'Lin' and 'Hustle' (like the movie Hustle &amp; Flow).&quot; Club promoters soon hired her to DJ all over from Seattle to Miami up to Canada and down to Las Vegas.

At the same time Sophia also boosted her modeling career with many photoshoots for various publications and features. She got into spokesmodeling at SEMA, Hot Import Nights, and various events around the USA. &quot;It's fun and exhausting at the same time. But its all worth it! Networking, traveling, meeting new people, being in the spotlight and putting a smile on peoples faces....that's what its all about!&quot;

With the success there have been obstacles and hardships along the way. &quot;Life hasn't been the easiest thing for me. I've been through everything a fifty year old has! except children!&quot; Sophia laughs. In the past year, Sophia went through surgery to remove tumors and finally release her from the pain she had been coping with for some time. &quot;So I appreciate life more than many people do.&quot;

What's next for Sophia? &quot;As long as I'm taking ten steps forward and no steps backwards. That is all that matters, but I'd really like to pursue becoming an actress and a performer. I'm still on the pursuit to happYness!&quot;

Beauty and talent.
Smart and sexy.
