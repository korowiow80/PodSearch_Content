    <title>Awakening to Conscious Co-Creation</title>
    <link>http://www.voiceamerica.com/rss/show/1564</link>
    <description>According to the Mayan Calendar, in February 2011, we will begin the ninth and final level of consciousness in the long-count, which will herald a 260 day opportunity for us to engage in conscious co-creation with Great Spirit. We need to prepare ourselves for this very exciting and unprecedented time in the history of planet Earth.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This series of shows will lay the groundwork for you to advance your awareness sufficiently to be fully involved in this powerful process. A variety of guests will bring their expertise to explain different aspects of transformation in consciousness.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Topics will include healing through different modalities, alchemy, the Indigo and Crystal children, earth energies, working with the invisible realms, sub-conscious body/mind programming, Conscious Corporations and more. Awakening to Conscious Co-Creation is broadcast live Wednesdays at Noon Pacific Time on 7th Wave Network.</description>

      <title>Raise Your Vibration and Align Your Life" with Norma Hollis</title>
      <description>Norma Hollis will discuss her life's work and findings. The key is Authenticity – being sincere, honest, trustworthy, real, caring for others and generally living a more satisfying and rewarding life. Authenticity resonates with the deepest part of your being and reflects your passion for your core values. It’s your natural style that utilizes your natural gifts and talents and shares them with the world. When you apply authenticity to communication, wellness, career, leadership and life, you create a world that others embrace and want to be a part of. As a result individuals and organizations attract customers, friends, associates and opportunities that connect with their authentic success.  www.NormaHollisSpeaks.com</description>

      <title>Lost Technologies of Ancient Egypt with Christopher Dunn</title>
      <description>In his book, “Lost Technologies of Ancient Egypt: Advanced Engineering in the Temples of the Pharaohs” Christopher Dunn focuses on an important aspect of his research into the manufacturing capabilities of the ancient Egyptians and through his engineer’s eye and camera, reveals to his readers previously overlooked magisterial characteristics of Egyptian architectural and manufacturing wizardry. Chris will discuss his insights including the evidence to suggest that the traditional Egyptologists view of the pyramids, as burial chambers, may well not be true.</description>

      <title>Use Your Body To Heal Your Mind with Dr. Henry Grayson</title>
      <description>Cumulative traumatic or painful developmental experiences are stored in our limbic system-our survival brain- and studies have shown a stunning connection between these and current illnesses. This knowledge has been the source of groundbreaking scientific fields which have changed the traditional reductionist view of medicine. Dr. Grayson draws on his understanding of this work and combines it with new insights to explore the core of what keeps us from embracing a healthy and productive life, Dr. Grayson will use examples to demonstrate how we can overcome chronic illness and disorders previously thought to be untreatable, return to good health and have the happiness that we fully deserve.</description>

      <title>The Five Principles of Authentic Living with Robert Rabbin</title>
      <description>Robert Rabbin thought he'd have the next 10 or 20 years to speak about his eighth and most recent book — The 5 Principles of Authentic Living: How to Live an Authentic Life in 10 Words — into which he poured the distilled essence of more than 40 years of intensive meditation and self-inquiry. In May 2011, Robert began what he thought would be years of teaching these 5 Principles to audiences around the world. But on January 6, 2012, he received the entirely unexpected news that he had "stage 4 lung cancer, spread to spinal bones." In his own words: “Now, I'm not so sure of the timeline of my life and work. Of course, it was always vanity to assume, but I must admit that one's life shifts dramatically when someone looks you in the eyes and say, "You have stage 4 lung cancer. . . " Robert will discuss his progress and the effect on his life and authentic living. www.AuthenticityAccelerator.com</description>

Laura will discuss the human ego mind which is a veiled consciousness and the awareness of the absolute which lies beyond ego.

      <title>The Alchemical Journey of Transformation with Peter Tongue</title>
      <description>On February 22nd, my guest for the day didn't make the show and so at the last minute I decided to do a review of the incredible events that have taken place in my own life and the collective lives of those people who have been involved as a result of our journey through the landscape zodiac since the 11:11:11 in November. That show has become a stage setter for this show and so I strongly suggest listening to it before this one. The month since February 22nd, has been the culmination of a phenomenal eighteen month journey coming to its conclusion on the equinox this week. I have no idea what this month is going to bring, but I will be giving you the update as soon as it is over today! In the meantime, I will have been to the hub of the Glastonbury Zodiac in England, as well as co-hosting our centre of the zodiac wheel ceremony in Victoria. It will be an amazing show! www.petertongue.com or www.myheartcenteredjourney.com</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: Effortless Freedom: Exploring Life's Timeless Nature with Matt Kahn</title>
      <description>In every spiritual path, there is the hope to alleviate the burden of personal suffering and experience the effortless freedom of life's timeless nature. As our unborn freedom is revealed, it can be directly realized within ourselves to be a spacious reality of awareness. It is an undivided state of being-existing prior to all concepts of space and time. Through a direct realization of life's timeless nature, one no longer remains interested in seeking the empty promises of spiritual achievement, and opens up to an intimate exploration of freedom encountering itself as life. Join Matt Kahn and host Peter Tongue as they explore the truth of realization in a brand-new way. "I have come to the realization that Matt Kahn has a very special gift that can raise our frequency of vibration and assist us enormously on our sacred journey. This is a repeat of his interview from January. Please listen and TUNE IN energetically to this wonderful young man." www.TrueDivineNature.com</description>

      <title>The Spirit of Place with Anthony Thorley</title>
      <description>Anthony Thorley is one of the foremost experts on landscape zodiacs and he will discuss the landscape as a living form, speaking to us, and ways in which we can make contact with the "Spirit of Place". Anthony has been leading monthly pilgrimages through the Landscape Zodiac in Glastonbury, England, for three years. He will reveal his findings, the importance of sacred sites, how they relate to our consciousness and the importance of synchronicity as a normal experience. Anthony will also discuss the causation of natural earth mysteries: ley lines, earth patterns, energy forms and zodiacs. How they come to exist and the role of our own consciousness and the power of our thought! See www.earthskywalk.com and www.thealchemicaljourney.co.uk</description>

      <title>Transcending the Guru with Jennifer Hough</title>
      <description>What if we could connect directly to infinite wisdom and have the confidence of our own innate knowing, finding our natural state of fluidity with life? Jennifer Hough will address this crucial question and more during the show. Is there a physical sense that allows us to go direct with the Universe and what is it? What is an integrated channel and can anyone experience that? Is it possible to have the same clarity about our purpose as the teachers and gurus we see...and even beyond? What is the experience of awakening and can we have that experience now? Jennifer will also lead us through some processes to assist us on this sacred and fluid dance.</description>

      <title>America's Most Mysterious Monument with Raymond Wiley</title>
      <description>The Georgia Guidestones are a collection of standing stones near Elberton, Georgia. Built in 1980, they are primarily composed of six slabs of granite: one central pillar, four "major" stones that fan out from the center, and a capstone. The capstone has engravings on all four of its sides in four different ancient languages, all of which read, "Let these be guidestones to an Age of Reason," Those guidelines have proven extremely controversial, causing speculation and rumors of conspiracy that go far beyond north-east Georgia. Raymond Wiley will discuss his findings and research on the show.</description>

      <description>Douglas Noll will discuss his book Elusive Peace-How Modern Diplomatic Strategies Could Better Resolve World Conflicts. Practicing at the intersection of Law and Human Conflict, Doug will discuss some of the reasons why reaching Peace is such a challenging problem. He will explain how personal experiences of injustice, anger, fear and betrayal contribute to the emotions in conflicts, which prevent people from thinking in a rational and reasoned way. Our beliefs, biases and conditioning all add to the emotional charge often experienced in intense conflict. Doug will provide insights into how we can arrive at peace through peacemaking, restorative justice, conflict resolution and meditation.</description>

      <title>Dancing With Your Dragon with Shaeri Richards</title>
      <description>Shaeri Richards will discuss her book which teaches you how to reclaim your personal power through the practice of unconditional love. Often, life's emotional challenges have to do with the unconscious needs and fears, which belong to the realm that author Shaeri Richards calls “the dragon.” Shaeri's new book Dancing with your Dragon: The Art of Loving your Unlovable Self is about opening the darkest regions of our inner being to the healing power of Divine unconditional love. This magical, transformative power is always accessible deep inside no matter what might be happening in the world around us. This book is designed to help people begin to access the disowned, denied and repressed energy of “the dragon” and to transform it into useable, productive life force or power. Dancing with your Dragon offers a spiritual practice designed to help us reclaim and reintegrate this denied power so that we can actually use it in our daily lives: www.dancingwithyourdragon.com</description>

      <title>Effortless Freedom: Exploring Life's Timeless Nature with Matt Kahn</title>
      <description>In every spiritual path, there is the hope to alleviate the burden of personal suffering and experience the effortless freedom of life's timeless nature. As our unborn freedom is revealed, it can be directly realized within ourselves to be a spacious reality of awareness. It is an undivided state of being-existing prior to all concepts of space and time. Through a direct realization of life's timeless nature, one no longer remains interested in seeking the empty promises of spiritual achievement, and opens up to an intimate exploration of freedom encountering itself as life. Join Matt Kahn and host Peter Tongue as they explore the truth of realization in a brand-new way. www.TrueDivineNature.com</description>

      <title>The Shift into 2012 - The Transition Year with Jim Self</title>
      <description>We’ve been hearing about “The Shift” for so long, it’s hard to believe that it’s finally here! But what precisely is shifting? What are we moving from? What are we moving toward? And – more importantly – what difference is it really going to make to your world… your life… your family… your loved ones… and you? Have you been noticing that…Time seems to be speeding up? Your memories aren't as reliable as they used to be? Stuff you thought you had dealt with is suddenly resurfacing? And nothing seems to be working the way it used to? You are not alone! If you have been hearing people talk about moving from the Third Dimension to the Fifth Dimension but you haven’t a clue how that’s going to come about, or what specific changes it’s going to bring, or even what the Fifth Dimension is – you are not alone. Jim Self will discuss the Shift, what it is and offer some powerful tools to navigate through these exciting yet challenging times. www.masteringalchemy.com</description>

      <title>Is Consciousness the Unified Field? with Dr. John Hagelin</title>
      <description>Progress in theoretical physics has lead to the discovery of a single universal, unified field at the basis of all forms and phenomena in the universe. At the same time, cutting edge research in the field of neuroscience has revealed the existence of a unified field of consciousness. John Hagelin, Ph.D. will discuss these parallel discoveries and raise questions concerning the relationship between the two. Dr. Hagelin will engage us in a fascinating exploration of the vast range of human potential; an all-encompassing perspective of humanity that is both visionary and practical.</description>

      <title>The Infinite Rhythm of Love and Freedom with Florian Schlosser</title>
      <description>In all of us there are two existential forces moving everything in life. On the one hand there is FREEDOM: it is the force that does not need, want or demand anything. Its inner quality is free of content. It is its own fulfillment and joy. On the other hand there is LOVE. It is the force that looks for unity, empathy and connection. Its inner quality is wanting to meet and being met. Feeling each other and savouring life as our own embodied experience is its natural expression. Florian Schlosser will play with the infinite rhythm between these apparently exclusive opposites. www.florianschlosser.com</description>

      <description>Peter Russell and Shauna Shapiro will discuss one of our critical challenges today, which is to free human thinking from the limiting beliefs and attitudes that lie behind so many of our problems: personal, social and global. They will also discuss the role of mindfulness meditation and how it can liberate us from such limitations, as well as the awareness that consciousness is the fundamental essence of the cosmos. With consciousness as primary awareness, everything remains the same and everything changes!!</description>

Dr. Richard London will discuss creating balance in your personal and professional lives through the power of language, creating miracles, eliminating fears and healing inside and out.</description>

      <description>There is a cosmic consciousness that, through use of symbols, allows us to comprehend and communicate our relationship with Earth, the Universe and life itself. This is a common thread binding the fabric of all mankind. Paul Burley will discuss his book, "The Sacred Sphere" which describes the history of the circle as a sacred two dimensional representation of the sphere, symbolizing mankind's relationships with each other, the world and the cosmos. Paul has a specific interest in archaeological and ethnographic analysis of prehistoric America and the support and protection of Native American cultural traditions.

Where do you fit in as a man in the world now?  Do you feel angry, resentful and frustrated much of the time? What is expected of you when you think about your home life, your work life and your family life? Jim will discuss his novel, based upon real situations, which follows the story of a disillusioned young man who did not receive the benefit of having a father guide and all the trials that brings for both him and his single mother.</description>

      <title>Touching The Light with Dr. Meg Blackburn Losey</title>
      <description>Dr. Meg returns to the show to discuss her new book: "Touching The Light-What Miracles are Made of". When we become out of balance with the field of creation, we begin to decay. We are no longer coordinated with the flow of creation and it begins to wall us off, compacting, even encapsulating energy around our weakest areas until we become sick or dysfunctional and our illness continues to deteriorate as blossoming doom. It will consume us until nothing is left. Once we return to universal harmonization, there is a momentary bump in our energy system as it reboots. Then, we begin to pulse with the rhythm of timelessness and our healthfulness returns. For more information visit: www.spiritlite.com</description>

      <title>The Dogon Speak to the World</title>
      <description>Bayuali: Dialogue of Energies in the Universe. In the Universe, knowledge that has remained intact since the time of the Pharoahs is now being shared with humanity to assist in restoring balance to our world. Indigenous people around the planet are reading the signs that our world and humanity are out of balance. As a result many aboriginal representatives are now coming forward to speak to the world and share their ancient knowledge. Together we have the potential to restore the world to balance, peace and harmony. Peter will interview Bikbaye Inejnema and Naba Iritah Shenmira – tune in and listen to what the Dogon have to say!</description>

      <title>Secrets in Plain Sight with Scott Onstott</title>
      <description>Multi-dimensional secrets of the universe have been encoded in art, architecture, urban design, and in the relationships between sacred sites on the earth. In uncovering these secrets Scott Onstott unveils an unlikely intersection of geometry, numerology, music, astronomy, physics, the Kabbalah, ancient Egyptian gods, the global elite, and much more. Exploring key monuments and their positions in Giza, Stonehenge, Chartres, Jerusalem, Rome, Paris, London, Edinburgh, Washington DC, New York, Winnipeg, and San Francisco brings to light a secret obsession shared by pharaohs, philosophers and kings; Templars and Freemasons; great artists and architects; popes and presidents, spanning the whole of recorded history up to the present time.

      <title>Dissolving the Shadow with Neil Kramer</title>
      <description>Neil Kramer gained an insight very early on in to how the general public has been lulled into ignorant confusion by our toxic cultural paradigms. As a result he was ahead of the field when all of the conspiracy theories began to emerge. Neil will explain how these dark projections are in fact a means of accelerating awakening. He will discuss the importance of dissolving the shadow through discernment, balance and integration, and an understanding of the need for flow in our masculine and feminine energies. Neil will also describe his 7-D model of dimensional realms and densities of consciousness. For more information go to www.neilkramer.com</description>

      <title>The Golden Oasis of Healing with Dr. Jayaneth Abeywickrama</title>
      <description>Dr. Jayanath Abeywickrama, born in 1971, belongs to the lineage of 31 generations of unbroken traditional Ayurveda, since Rishi Pulasti 2668-2616 B.C. He is the main Ayurvedic physician of Rankema Ayurveda Centre, home for traditional Ayurveda of Sri Lanka, and was trained under the ancient Gurukula (teacher-disciple) tradition of Ayurveda, inherent to his land. He possesses a wealth of very rare, valuable and profound knowledge of traditional Sri Lankan indigenous medicine, which is of international importance in today’s context. Abey is a renowned Ayurvedic medical practitioner and healer, with a unique talent and he will share his deep knowing during this interview. It is his particular concern to evoke again a feeling of value and appreciation in people for the fundamental life-giving, life-sustaining principles, both regarding to our self, to others, and to our natural and spiritual resources.</description>

      <title>Andrea Mathews: Why Isn’t the Law of Attraction Working</title>
      <description>Are you having trouble implementing what you’ve come to understand as the principles of the Law of Attraction? Are you thinking positive thoughts, running your affirmations daily, maintaining your meditation practice and working your vision boards, but getting no results? Well, perhaps the problem isn’t you. Perhaps, the soul was never meant to work the way our current understanding of the Law of Attraction requires we work.  Andrea Mathews, our guest for today, suggests that perhaps we need to revise the Law of Attraction. In fact, in her book, coming out next month, entitled “The Law of Attraction: The Soul’s Answer To Why It Isn’t Working And How It can” she suggests that not only is our current understanding of this law based on principles that the soul cannot perform, but that there is actually a more viable Law of Attraction that offers us even greater rewards than those promised by our current understanding. You are not going to want to miss this one.</description>

      <title>The Elongated Skulls of Peru with Brien Foerster</title>
      <description>Brien Foerster will discuss his evolving life path in which he is probably retracing the steps of the ancient civilization of MU. Growing up on the west coast of Canada, he became fascinated with the Native art of the Haida native people, and began carving totem poles. He subsequently moved to Maui where he again embraced the local indigenous culture, before moving to Peru where he studied the Inca culture which led to his book, “A Brief History Of The Incas”, which is available on his website: www.hiddenincatours.com Brien will also explain his involvement in the analysis of the elongated human skulls of the Paracas of Peru.</description>

      <title>Earth Mysteries and the Indigo Children with Hugh Newman</title>
      <description>Hugh met some 'indigo children' in Hawaii in 2003 who initiated him into working with the earth's energy grid. Since then, he has researched the subject thoroughly and will explore aspects of his new book looking at the history and new research on global grids that involves ancient maps, sacred geography, 'great earth circles', and ancient metrology. He will also discuss earth energies, geomathematics and leys; and how the ancient megalithic sites around the world were carefully placed by an as yet unknown sophisticated maritime civilisation with a 'plan'.

      <title>SOULISTRY - Artistry of the Soul</title>
      <description>June Maffin will discuss her book which is about creative ways to nurture your spirituality.

One review says, "Many of us strive for greater understanding of how spirit operates in our lives and how to nurture that spirit. Or, we feel stuck and yearn to become unstuck and to develop a practice to follow.

      <title>Sacred Mystical Journeys of the Sacred Feminine</title>
      <description>Finbarr Ross will discuss the second coming of the Christ within, Christ Consciousness and the great significance of the Sacred Feminine at this time. We will journey to mysterious France to experience a land rich in tradition. We will absorb the energies of this ancient European culture and its Celtic roots, where later Christian, Gnostic, Jewish, and Muslim traditions recognized the 'Sacred Feminine Ethos' with equal enthusiasm. Although our journey is within the 21st Century, we will discover the threads of universal consciousness that predated Christianity still alive today. We will discuss many wonderful power sites held sacred by those who have sought the Holy Grail and the presence of Mary Magdalene including: Rennes-le Chateau, Grotte de Baume, Maries de La Mer, Carcassonne, Montségur, the mystical Languedoc, the stunningly beautiful Chartres Cathedral, and Paris: www.celticmysticaljourneys.com</description>

      <title>Awesomism - A New Way to Understand the Diagnosis of Autism</title>
      <description>After a 22-year career as a pediatric speech language pathologist, Suzy Miller met a four-year old child diagnosed with autism who was destined to change not only the way she viewed autism, but life in general. This powerful interaction left her with the skill of telepathy, which she uses to communicate with the highest aspects of who we are, bringing awareness and integration of those higher aspects of self into our daily lives. She will also discuss The New Human Experience Project, a revolutionary process that is designed to support the ability to shift consciously and joyfully to higher expressions of self. As we become the new humans, humanity is going through a process where we are continually being re-calibrated to the highest aspect of who we really are. Throughout the world, many are now being called to rediscover and reconnect with the potential and possibilities that have been hidden within them for so long.

      <title>Right Here, Right Now - Invitations for Expanding Awareness</title>
      <description>This is an invitation to explore the SELF right now!  Canela Michelle Meyers will discuss her book, which offers written invitations that provoke the reader to awaken to themself more and more while also offering possibilities to practice allowing for a more peaceful and enjoyable life. After her shift to the Realized State of Being in 1998, it was an easy and effortless shift to support people in Satsang – simply being with people, seeing and feeling the energy in the moment. She doesn’t scan people, she is simply completely open and speaks of what is felt or heard on all levels, in the openness of the moment. These Invitations came from the years of experience of being with many people, individually and in the business setting. For more information visit: www.canelamichelle.com</description>

      <title>The Alchemical Journey:  Re-Building the Zodiac Memory Theatre of the Soul</title>
      <description>John Wadsworth is a professional astrologer, based in Glastonbury, England. He is the founder of The Alchemical Journey, a twelve month adventure in personal and spiritual transformation around the great landscape wheel of the Glastonbury Zodiac. John will share his insights into the astrology of our times, and how working with the alchemy of the zodiac wheel can help us to re-member who we are as cosmic beings, and take the quantum leap in consciousness that is required to step through the portal of 2012 and into the next world age.

      <title>The Trivedi Effect</title>
      <description>The Trivedi Effect is a technique of mental energy transmission that, according to more than 4,000 well-documented scientific studies, has the ability to profoundly affect matter and unlimited potential to impact human wellness. For more than a decade now, Mahendra Kumar Trivedi has devoted his life to harnessing the powers of this gift and using it in a wide range of beneficial ways. He has directed his attention, and this energy, to everything from human wellness and sustainable agriculture to atomic and cellular research. The results of these studies and others on the Trivedi Effect (the impact of the energy transmissions on living and non-living material) are published in hundreds of reports available under the Scientific Research section of the Trivedi Foundation website: www.trivedifoundation.org Trivedi will discuss his work and examples of some of the remarkable results that have resulted as well as offering a three blessing package after the show.</description>

      <description>How can we Strengthen our Alignment with Source? The Source of our creation, which is all that is good, true and beautiful.

She will also explain the difference between the Age of Pisces and the Age of Aquarius.

      <title>Lost Star of Myth and Time</title>
      <description>Walter Cruttenden will discuss ideas proposed in his book, "Lost Star of Myth and Time", that provides an alternative view of history based on the solar systems motion through space. He believes that the myth and folklore depicting a repeating cycle of Golden ages and Dark Ages may have a basis in fact, due to the alternating stellar forces that effect Earth as our solar system moves in a 24,000 year binary (dual star) orbit. The discussion will include his interpretation of the precession of the equinox as well as the possibility that we are living in a binary star system with cyclical rise and fall of civilization and consciousness as a result.

      <title>Essence of the Dragon</title>
      <description>The Dragonlight Essences were created by Antoinette O'Connell from Ireland and Ana Vidal from Brazil. They both already had extensive experience in healing work when they met in 2006. Ana had worked with refugees who were victims of torture and Antoinette had treated animals, who were mistreated and abused. United by the mutual interest in researching ways to help heal the pain in the body and soul, as well as to strengthen the people and animals, who they work with, they co-created the Dragonlight Essences. Dragons are beings made from earth and cosmic energies. They are here at this moment to help us heal ourselves and the planet. Each one of them has access to various sources of energy that they use to support us and our planet with this task. Each one of them carries a frequency of energy that keeps our planet healthy and balanced. http://www.dragonenergycenter.com/en/dragon_essences.php</description>

      <title>"Sun of gOd"</title>
      <description>Does it really make sense that our 13.7 billion year-old universe waited 13.698 billion years before anything in it developed what we call 'consciousness'? And that the experience was restricted to humans? Sun of gOd is a radical re-think of our Sun, our universe and what it means to be alive. Using scientific ideas and bringing them to their logical philosophical conclusions, Gregory Sams proposes that our Sun itself is conscious, living and fully aware of its place in the universe. Furthermore, our Sun communicates with other stars, and with us, in ways which mirror our own communities and even the way in which our own brains function. According to Gregory, 'Creative intelligence is a 'bottom-up' system in which everything, from molecules of water, to neurons in our brain to the Sun itself is working together to gently steer and organize our universe.</description>

      <title>Adam's Calendar; Discovering the Oldest Man-made Structure on the Earth</title>
      <description>Michael Tellinger has become one of South Africa’s bestselling export authors. His regular articles on human origins and his book Slave Species of god have been praised by readers in over 20 countries. More than 75,000 years ago, early humans built a stone calendar that predates all other man-made structures found to date. This remarkable stone structure was originally a large circular structure resembling, but predating Stonehenge by many thousands of years. Adam's calendar is built along the same longitudinal axis as the Great Pyramid and is also aligned with Orion's belt when it rose on the horizon 75,000 years ago. Adam's calendar takes us further back in time closer to the emergence of Homo sapiens, than any other structure ever found to date and it will force historians and archaeologists to reconsider ancient human activity and consciousness. Peter will discuss the book and these fascinating discoveries with Michael: www.slavespecies.com</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Game in 3D</title>
      <description>The information presented in The Cosmic Game in 3D: Mastering Reality, Mastering the Matrix of the Mind by Sonia Barrett will steer the mind into a behind-the-scenes view of the closely controlled invisible system. The Cosmic Game in 3D simplifies an understanding of science, consciousness and spirituality as a naturally intertwined experience. Peter and Sonia will discuss the book, which takes the reader on a journey into many levels of this reality’s game design. It allows you to see answers about why your life continues to unfold in the manner it has. The book expresses the virtual nature of reality and the manner in which we and everything around us exist as holographic projections from within, unfolding from the matrix of the mind. Through these discoveries The Cosmic Game in 3D takes a glimpse into the illusion of death and of time as currently accepted and experienced.</description>

      <title>The Master Game</title>
      <description>“What is the Master Game? Who is playing it? Where? How? Why? And which side is winning?” Robert Bauval asks these questions in his most recent book “The Master Game.” In it he acknowledges that for a very long time there has been a belief, sometimes widely held and proclaimed, sometimes held only by persecuted minorities, that we humans are here on this planet to nurture and perfect our souls – and thus to equip ourselves for immortality. Those who hold such beliefs usually also believe that negative spiritual forces are at work amongst mankind – evil angels who seek to lead us astray and divert us from our true path. In this book he explores a number of mysterious ancient documents, prominent amongst them the so-called Hermetic Texts, written down in Latin and Greek in the early centuries of the Christian era.

      <title>From Sinixt to Somerset</title>
      <description>In 1987, an enigmatic encounter with a Native American visionary drew Celia Gunn into the renascence of his people, the Sinixt First Nation of British Columbia, declared extinct by the Canadian government in 1956. For six years, Celia walked a path that few have followed, working with members of the Band on cultural preservation projects. Setting a number of historical precedents, in 1989, the Sinixt were the first Band to ask for repatriation of ancestral remains, and to date are still upholding the longest and most peaceful occupation of Crown Land in Canadian history, as they continue their struggle for their right to exist, while taking up their role as stewards of the land. Celia will share some of her shamanic experiences and her understanding of the vital relevance of traditional Native American wisdom to us all. With her husband, Anthony Thorley, she now applies what she learned,</description>

      <description>Peter will discuss with Gary his book, "Everything You Need To Know to Get To Heaven", which successfully merges spirituality, the world's major religions, science, and new age concepts into one easy to understand book. The author decodes the Holy Bible, redefines the Holy Trinity in a new and enlightening manner, and provides convincing arguments for the evolution of consciousness, the big bang, and Darwin's "missing link." Exposed within this book is the secret behind the ominous 2012 date as prophesied by Edgar Cayce, Nostradamus, the Hopi elders, and the Mayan people. As a Licensed Professional Counselor, the author further discloses simple but effective ways in which to make positive changes in your life now.</description>

      <description>It has become very clear that our current western world education system is archaic and not meeting the needs of our children. Peter will discuss with two co-creators of the new educational paradigms, Zahra Lightway and Terry Damlos, the frustrations and challenges that the children of today are having with our current school system. They will also discuss new exciting and innovative educational models that will turn the current system upside down and bring a new refreshing perspective on what the children are crying out for in their education. "Seeding the Future Now" will be explained as a new organization that will assist any community in the world to bring forward a new creative, nurturing, alternative educational system to better support students of all ages.

      <title>Nonviolent Communication, Dissolving Separation and Giving Birth to a New World</title>
      <description>There is no doubt that we are at an evolutionary threshold ... a time where the divide between science and spirituality is rapidly dissolving ... a time where we are waking up to the highly active role we play in a cause and effect world. And yet, despite our growing awareness, language itself and its direct impact on shaping our reality and relationships, receives sparse attention. Because it is acquired so early and we are therefore fused with it, our every day usage escapes scrutiny as a significant contributor to much of the conflict we face. It is rare in fact in situational conflict for us to examine how our mainly conditioned and thereby unconscious choice of words is not only reactive but also causal. During this hour, Rachelle shares with Peter the ways in which language and communication is leading the way to a new and exciting frontier of possibility. In practical terms, how our chosen words can effectively dissolve conflict and the accompanying illusion of separation</description>

      <title>The Bushman Way of Tracking God</title>
      <description>After ten years of visiting and studying the Kalahari Bushman, Brad Keeney knows first-hand that the last word on spirituality comes from the oldest living culture on the planet. For the first time, Bushman elders have given permission for the heart of this ageless and ancient tradition to be made available to a spiritually fragmented world. With humor, amazing true stories, and the lush, vibrant spiritual landscape of the African desert, Brad discusses with Peter his book and the way the Bushman way of tracking God takes you through the veil, linking the threads of world religions to a source that is unlike any other-ecstatic joy, deepest peace and a connecting rope to God that pulls each of us along to a greater meaning in life: www.shakingmedicine.com</description>

      <title>Cymatics: Insights into the Invisible Realms of Creation</title>
      <description>For the past 25 years, Jeff Volk has been popularizing the science of Cymatics, which demonstrates through simple physics experiments how “inert” matter can be “animated” into life-like flowing forms by the unseen forces of vibration. The implications of these experiments are vast and have inspired profound insights into the hidden realms of nature in many who have seen them. These insights pertain not only to our world at large, but also in deeply personal ways to the subtle realms of human nature, which are often just as mysterious. Jeff’s penetrating poetry springs from pondering how these universal principles of cause and effect that are demonstrated objectively in the realms of physics by Cymatics, play out subjectively in our personal lives. His work spans a wide range of topics, but always seeks to offer a wider perspective and an inclusiveness that integrates the disparate . . . in ways that only poetry can.

      <description>“We are entering a profound time of change and transition on the planet. Life is no longer business as usual. We are being propelled into an unprecedented leap in consciousness – a time indigenous tribes would call a collective INITIATION and rebirth.” A remarkable catalyst, speaker and performing artist Karen Rae Wilson will share her poetry, songs and wisdom from a wide perspective on the heart of social and personal change. She has sung for presidents, sat with the Bushman of the Kalahari and served on the Steering Committee for the 4th U.N. Conference on Woman. As founder of Wisdom Culture Consulting Karen Rae designs transformative vision Quests to empower visionary leaders to be part of creating a new social architecture and a sustainable world. Karen Rae joins Peter in a lively discussion on how the present global challenges are an opportunity for awakening the “genius factor”– a higher octave of creativity, leadership, and a community of love. www.wisdomculture.com</description>

      <title>Here at the End of All Things: 2012 and the Path of Grace</title>
      <description>2012 will soon be upon us (although there are those who feel that 2012 has come and gone!), and people are asking "What in the world is going on, and what is to come?" Phil Gruber feels that the late author William S. Burroughs had a true handle regarding the events that we are presently enmeshed in at this most critical juncture in our tenure here as embodied souls.  Most of what the world knows, or at least, suspects about the times we find ourselves in comes mainly from the calendrical calculations of the Aztec, Maya, and the scholars, and self-proclaimed 'experts' that have been doing their best to keep us 'up-to-date' regarding the shape of things to come. Phil offers what he suspects may be going on regarding the prophecies and predictions centering around 2012.  He will talk about the nature of time and prophesy, the role of the Indigos, what it means to work with the consciousness of time, and what is required to move through this period with ease, grace, and most of all, peac</description>

      <title>Understanding Life Beyond Ascension</title>
      <description>In 2003, George Kavassilas had the opportunity to travel through the dimensions of our Universe and rediscover what life here on this planet is all about. We are far more significant and magnificent in the greater scheme of things than we can possibly imagine. George has a comprehensive understanding of the ascension process, including the harmonics and timing of the two main phases of our DNA's transformation into Homo Illuminous. George will discuss how we can prepare ourselves for the future changes that are upon us, what the ascension will be like and what we can expect. George will also provide us with a broader galactic perspective of Earth's unique position amongst the stars and why humanity and the planet are such a central focus of attention to extra-terrestrial life forms at this time.

      <title>Approaching Chaos: Illuminating Insights into How We Can Help Ourselves</title>
      <description>In her intriguing new book, Approaching Chaos, Lucy Wyatt takes an original and relevant look at just what we can do to reverse our civilization’s potential economic, ecological and spiritual meltdown. The product of some ten years of passionate research, this book urges us to take a good look way back beyond those societies always admired as the first civilized examples. Considered to be both primitive and pagan, Lucy reveals them to be in many ways extraordinarily sophisticated, well-rounded and highly successful infrastructures that combine the spiritual and the practical. In taking a fresh look at the origins of farming and urbanisation, the extraordinary way that the Egyptians used metaphysics, ultrasound and alchemy, the rise of Monotheistic religion and Christianity, Lucy presents a brave and compelling over-view of ancient history. Lucy challenges long accepted thinking on the origins of civilization and uncovers many illuminating insights into how we could help ourselves toda</description>

      <description>Graham Hancock realizes that “time is not what it seems”...in his first novel, Entangled, a drug overdose causes Leoni, a troubled teen from twenty-first-century Los Angeles, to have a near-death experience, her soul is lifted from the modern world and flung into a parallel time 24,000 years in the past. There her fate becomes entangled with that of Ria, a young Stone Age woman fighting for her life against the ferocious Illimani, an army of evil led by the vicious Sulpa, a powerful demon determined to destroy humanity. But there is still hope; if Leoni and Ria can rise to the challenge fate has set them. Uniting outside the flow of earth time, they must venture forth into regions of wonder, master their own deepest fears, and fight battles they could never have prepared for, if Sulpa is to be defeated. Listen to this riveting interview to uncover the Truth about near-death, out-of-body experiences, time travel, use of hallucinogens and telepathy. Visit www.grahamhancock.com</description>

      <title>Healing With Source</title>
      <description>Peter will discuss with Dave Markowitz his book, "Healing With Source", which is a spiritual guide to Mind-Body Medicine describing the most time and cost efficient healing modality available. Whereas most healing modalities focus on symptoms, "Healing With Source", focuses on reversing the causative factors. In fact, if you focus on the symptom the Law of Attraction would say you will only get more of the symptom! At best, that can only provide temporary pain management. While that’s not a bad thing, in and of itself, true, permanent healing only happens when you reverse the causative factors. You will gain a paradigm shifting understanding of health, prevention, and healing that focuses on reversing the underlying causes of pain and illness at the root.

      <description>What do the so-called sacred sites all over the world have to do with consciousness? Is it possible that the ancients left us keys to who we really are and what we are capable of? What does sacred geometry have to do with these sites, our consciousness, and the symbols of World Religions? How does all of this tie together to literally solve the meaning of the Mayan calendar? Dr. Meg Blackburn returns to the show to discuss her latest book: "The Secret History of Consciousness." She will talk about major connections between sacred sites across the World, consciousness, creation, sacred geometry and the mayan calendar. She will reveal how the ancients left us road maps to help us discover the basic elements of creation, missed by our science. Dr. Meg will also discuss the affect inter-dimensional events have on us in our 3-D World. Visit www.spiritlite.com</description>

      <title>A New Paradigm in Self-Care</title>
      <description>Instantly realizing the possibilities to world health with a technology that awakens the body's own "divine healing ability", Sam Adams world-class marketing guru, motivational speaker and artist, chose to drop everything and become the driving force behind the launch of this technology into North America and as such has started a global self care revolution. Peter discusses with Sam this "Amized Fusion Technology," which is playing a phenomenally effective role in restoring the human body to homeostasis. Amega Global’s products are returning the body to balance so that it can heal itself. Sam is the premier leader who brought Amega to the Americas, and will explain the technology and describe some of the remarkable benefits people have experienced, including direct personal testimonies on the air. We will hear firsthand that when cells in the body return to balance, real healing takes place. For more information visit: www.wellnesswithzeropoint.net</description>

      <title>Kids Who See Ghosts</title>
      <description>When children see ghosts, what is a parent to do? Moms and Dads ask themselves, “Does my child possess unique gifts, or is my kid possessed? Will this be a one-time, weird event, or is my child destined to be haunted for life? Does my child need psychological help or some kind of medication? Should I believe what my child reports even if I don’t believe in ghosts?” Peter discusses with author Caron Goode ways in which “Kids Who See Ghosts” can be helped and supported. This much needed information is enlightening about the frightening, empowering parents and children alike to manage these extraordinary experiences.

      <description>One of the greatest challenges we face in our lives is to genuinely and honestly love ourselves totally in full acceptance for who we are.  Peter will discuss with Janice Parviainen her book and programs, which enable us to crack the veil of illusions that prevent each and every one of us from being all that we can be, personally and professionally.  “Courage to Love Yourself” is a crucial step along our awakening path and Janice offers practical tools and insights to help us on our sacred journey.  Janice Parviainen is a listener, speaker and writer: “When you love yourself, you realize you are not meant to suffer and you are never alone. When you love yourself you realize we are all here for a profound purpose. To somehow make this world a better place. You have come perfectly equipped with the exact strengths and the courage to challenge your shortcomings with joy and determination. For you are a unique orchestration of both.” For more information visit: www.couragetolove.ca</description>

      <title>Swami Beyondananda: the “Cosmic Comic”</title>
      <description>For years people have been asking the Swami if he has any "disciples" and for years the Swami has insisted that he has no followers because he gets paranoid when he thinks he is being followed. Nonetheless, he has been looking for ways to encourage and empower others to practice the ancient art of Foo Ling -- using laughter as a tool to enlighten up their own lives, and the lives of those around them. And one of the best ways to multiply healing laughter is to celebrate those moments when laughter leads to breakthrough -- what the Swami calls moments of Fool-Realization. Swami Beyondananda is a highly acclaimed keynote speaker and performer whose specialty is using mind-opening comedy to create heart-opening laughter. For the past 23 years, the Swami (in reality humorist and author Steve Bhaerman) has performed at spiritual centers, at theatres, community centers and new thought churches. Swami's comedy has been described both as "comedy disguised as wisdom" and "wisdom disguised</description>

      <description>Kathleen McGowan is a publishing sensation, an author whose novels immerse readers in a beautiful and spiritually meaningful world of ancient prophecies, ecclesiastical intrigue, and Biblical secrets revealed. The first two installments in the Magdalene Line series (The Expected One and The Book of Love) beguiled lovers of historical and religious fiction and won her a vast and loyal fan following. Her novel The Expected One sold over a million copies worldwide and has appeared in over fifty languages. Now she continues the saga in The Poet Prince.  Kathleen is a "History Avenger." History was largely written by the victors and the oppressors, and some of the greatest stories and characters in history, those of women who have changed the world, have been very nearly lost to us. She feels her job is to find those stories and return them to the world. Kathleen McGowan strives to be a voice for those who have lost theirs!

      <description>Peter discusses with Dr. Carmen Boulter “The Pyramid Code” which is a documentary series of 5 episodes that explores the pyramid fields and ancient temples in Egypt as well as ancient megalithic sites around the world looking for clues to matriarchal consciousness, ancient knowledge and sophisticated technology in a Golden Age. The series is based on the extensive research done in 23 trips to Egypt and 50 other countries around the world by Carmen in the Graduate Division of Educational Research at the University of Calgary. They will discuss topics including; Who were the ancients and what did they know? Are the pyramids much older than we have been told? Are there still secrets hidden in plain sight? What is the connection to the stars and constellations in the Milky Way Galaxy? Are there clues to the approaching 2012 events? For more information visit: www.pyramidcode.com</description>

      <description>Barbara Hand Clow combines her knowledge of the Mayan Calendar, Astrology and the Nine Dimensions of consciousness to give a startling insight into what is happening on our planet at this critical time. The end date of the Mayan Calendar - 2011/2012 - approaches Earth like a strange attractor in the sky. It heralds the completion of the Nine Underworlds as described by the Swedish biologist, Carl Johan Calleman, and the alignment of our solar system with the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Barbara will discuss the influence of the summer solstice, lunar and solar eclipses of this summer and current world developments including the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. We are in the midst of an evolutionary critical leap that inspires us to heal our bodies, transmute our emotional blocks, clarify our minds, and discover our souls. Barbara Hand Clow assists us with this growth. Her website, www.handclow2012.com offers free astrological analysis based on the Mayan Calendar.</description>

      <title>Living with Psychic Children</title>
      <description>What would you do if your child told you that he was interacting with beings that you could not sense? How does a parent who is totally unprepared deal with these occurrences?  This is the situation that Christina Pierson, author of A Knowing – Living with Psychic Children, found herself in and one that she knows other parents of psychic children have had to try to manage on their own.  Today Peter will speak to Christina about her experiences through her children; the many challenges that they have faced over the last ten years; what she has learned from this journey; and techniques that can help children to clear their energy and to protect themselves.  They will also discuss insights regarding our journey here that have come through her children.  Christina will share what it took to begin challenging her “rational mind” and to embark on a path of learning to try to support and help her children and in turn enhancing her own life and understanding of our experience here.</description>

      <title>Ancient Prophecies, Ecclesiastical Intrigue, and Biblical Secrets Revealed</title>
      <description>Kathleen McGowan is a publishing sensation, an author whose novels immerse readers in a beautiful and spiritually meaningful world of ancient prophecies, ecclesiastical intrigue, and Biblical secrets revealed. The first two installments in the Magdalene Line series (The Expected One and The Book of Love) beguiled lovers of historical and religious fiction and won her a vast and loyal fan following. Her novel The Expected One sold over a million copies worldwide and has appeared in over fifty languages. Now she continues the saga in The Poet Prince.  Kathleen is a "History Avenger." History was largely written by the victors and the oppressors, and some of the greatest stories and characters in history, those of women who have changed the world, have been very nearly lost to us. She feels her job is to find those stories and return them to the world. Kathleen McGowan strives to be a voice for those who have lost theirs!

      <title>Message from the Dolphins</title>
      <description>Aros Crystos is a galactic emissary and star being who came to this planet through a soul exchange-an agreement between to two souls to allow one of them to take over the body occupied previously by another soul.  From that moment on, Aros became a galactic human being armored with powerful healing and transformative energies that have developed to activate their full potential.  Through years of coaching, Aros has created a life formula of depth and timeless practicality that shifts people to live in clarity beyond the ego's storyline. His message is around the mass consciousness shift, which is happening NOW!  He speaks about a sense of great change that is swelling in peoples' subconscious across the planet. As this is happening, individuals are choosing a response somewhere along the scale from fear of what's coming, seeing an outcome of apocalypse, or the opposite of fear which is joy and an outcome of ecstasy and love as we transcend fear and move into a heaven on earth.</description>

      <title>The Coming Human Evolution: The Truth Behind Crop Circles</title>
      <description>Despite an expensive debunking campaign, crop circles are a proven genuine phenomenon that exhibit identical properties to ancient temples, which were built for the purpose of elevating the soul. So, what makes these designs tick? How are they connected to ancient sacred sites? How are they moving our evolution forward? How are they coding the Earth, even the very water we drink? People talk about the Second Coming, but perhaps it is already here in a way no one ever expected. Join Freddy Silva, best-selling author of “Secrets In The Fields,” worldwide keynote speaker, and leading expert on crop circles and ancient systems of knowledge.

      <title>Spiritual Mastery in Shifting Times</title>
      <description>Dannion Brinkley will share invaluable information about these times of unprecedented physical and spiritual change. Never before have we played such an imperative and critical role in helping to shift and elevate mass consciousness. As we come to understand the multidimensional universe existing within and around us, we all become individually responsible for our collective ascension into higher levels of light and galactic awareness. This is indeed the time long heralded by the ancient prophets, as the End Times. But what is ending is not the world. What is ending is a world motivated by greed, fueled with intolerance, and driven in chaos. Dannion will share the ways in which love, prayer, belief and choice can transform our quality of life as we journey into the coming revolution in human consciousness. Together, we are birthing the Golden Age of Peace.  For more information visit: www.dannion.com</description>

      <title>Cosmic Laws, Geometric Metaphors, and the Lucid Experience of Non-dual Forgiveness</title>
      <description>Since the beginning of time, there have been cosmic laws that govern all life from quarks to galaxies. Two world views; one of wholeness and inclusion, and the other, which permeates most of our thinking in both obvious and insidious ways, deals with separation, differences, specialness and exclusion. We have the power to choose – moment to moment – which thought system we want to use ... the one gently originating from a peaceful feeling beyond fearful or conflicted motivations, the other never quite resulting in anything we are happy with. The world view/identity/thought system of pure oneness engages these same universal laws in ways that result in vastly different experiences. Symbolic indicators in the material world in geometric form can be metaphoric reminders to choose the inclusive thought system which helps us forgive our misperceptions and ditch the victimizing, dysfunctional practice of blame, bringing our prodigal selves to lasting serenity.</description>

      <description>With all of the focus and often contradictory information around December 21st, 2012, Peter will discuss with John Major Jenkins the key controversies and enigmas surrounding this date, how we can cut through all of the noise and gain true wisdom from Maya teachings about our present moment in history. John will explain how the early Maya devised the calendar that gives us the cycle ending in 2012 and how it works. He will also tell us what the Maya thought about cycle endings and their significance. Latest news on the evidence specific to 2012 found at the site at Tortuguero, monument 6, will also be disclosed. Join us in our discussion of the December Solstice Sun and Galactic Centre Alignment, which occurs for the first time in 26,000 years.

Peter and Jim will discuss the film which explores the lives of Gifted Children, with eye-opening clues as to why Big-Pharma keeps kids (and adults) on Meds. It teaches people how to re-awaken to become fully actualized human beings by re-igniting the spark of their true essence.  From the time of birth to the main-stream school system, kids and young adults are already being programmed to think a certain way. Learn how to break old patterns and belief systems that keep parents and their children from exhibiting all that they can be. For more information visit: www.voiceentertainment.net</description>

      <description>Cyrilla Gallagher will explain how the blending of information from astrology and numerology will give important information about our unique personalities and our destiny in this life time. She will include some specific examples to illustrate how this works.

      <title>Anastasia and The Ringing Cedars of Russia</title>
      <description>Dr. Leonid Sharashkin discusses his life transforming experiences as a result of translating and editing the "Ringing Cedars" series of books coming out of Russia, based upon a young woman called Anastasia who lives her life, wholly in relationship with God, Nature, Man and the Universe.  A mysteriously powerful woman, Anastasia, who was discovered in 1995, lives in the wilderness—for the most part without warm clothes, food cultivation or man-made shelter—and survives on fruit, nuts, berries and mushrooms, brought to her by "wild" animals with whom she lives in peaceful harmony. The books offer us practical ways in which we can start the task of saving our planet. Having recently returned from an inspiring visit to Russia, Dr. Leo will talk about the importance of growing our own garden, the raising of our children and purifying our thoughts to manifest our reality.

      <description>Richard Leblanc discusses his project with a conscious therapeutic community, which offers homeless and other "marginalized" individuals an opportunity to re-build their lives within a structured long term residential program. Woodwynn Farm Community, a short distance from Victoria, BC, with 193 acres of productive farmland, provides a home, healthcare and legal assistance, to change lives and regain the confidence needed by its members to enter back into society as productive, comfortable, healthy contributors. The rural farm environment provides a combination of fresh air, hard manual work and daily routines that transforms the "whole person" and develops confidence, a positive value system and a career plan to help ensure personal and employment stability throughout their life. This holistic approach encompasses all areas of physical, emotional, mental and spiritual well being of the person: www.creatinghomefulness.org</description>

      <description>What information can the intelligence of the heart provide us with, and how can the collective power of the heart generated by humanity help change the world? Join Howard Martin from the HeartMath Institute and learn about amazing new findings that show that the heart sends powerful healing commands to the rest of the body that can improve health, emotional well-being and performance. You’ll also learn about the Global Coherence Initiative, a science based project that is uniting many thousands of people around the world. This Initiative is increasing the individual and collective level of heart coherence and caring intentions towards creating greater cooperation and harmony for all of humanity. Learn how HeartMath scientists are using advanced technologies to measure changes in the earth’s energetic fields and how these experiments will test the hypothesis that mass human emotion has a measureable affect on the planet itself.  www.heartmath.com</description>

      <description>Rollin McCraty, PhD. of the Institute of HeartMath discusses heart coherence, which can be measured by smooth, balanced heart-rhythm patterns associated with sustained positive emotion. It is a state of energetic alignment and cooperation between heart, mind, body and spirit. Intention from a person in a heart-coherent state goes out like a radio wave and interacts with and modulates planetary energetic fields, thus potentially affecting the collective consciousness that is tuned into these field environments.  He will also discuss The Global Coherence Initiative, which is a science-based initiative to unite millions of people in heart-focused care and intention to shift global consciousness from instability and discord to balance, cooperation and enduring peace. Researchers at the Institute of HeartMath are exploring how augmenting specific practices with heart coherence can have an even greater</description>

      <title>Lessons From A Navy Seal On Unleashing Your Hidden Potential</title>
      <description>Former Navy Seal, Michael Jaco, discusses his awakening to higher consciousness and the development of his intuitive ability to not only avert danger but to transform energies and prevent attacks from taking place.  Michael says: "The most profound experience that I have had as a Navy SEAL or Security Contractor in a combat zone was when I intuited that we were about to be attacked while traveling down a road in Baghdad, Iraq. I then had the overwhelming feeling to send out the thought of love and so I projected it out. We continued on without being shot at but the group right after us was attacked a few moments later in that exact location. I feel the whole world could benefit from this experience on many levels.”</description>

      <title>How Real People Build Conscious Community</title>
      <description>Peter discusses the development of conscious community with guest Richard Flyer who is the founder of the Conscious Community Network in Reno, Nevada; while outlining the similarities with Peter’s own Conscious Centred Community in Victoria, BC, Canada. Richard explains how CCN has spent the last six years building a successful model that integrates spiritual awakening with social transformation in the local region. Taking into account historical perspectives, Richard will consider what the ideal conscious community looks like, why we haven't reached this ideal and why current approaches to changing the World fail to work. Find out what will work and become a weaver of health, sanity, love and functionality in your own community.  For more information visit www.itstimereno.org</description>

      <description>In a dynamic interview, Raffi brings to life the Covenant &amp; Principles of Child Honouring as offering a universal ethic for humanity. Echoing the Dalai Lama’s plea for a universal ethic for the world’s billions, regardless of religion, and Nelson Mandela’s call to “turn this world around, for the children!”, Raffi presents Child Honouring as a “compassion revolution”, a unifying principle for societal change. Child Honouring is a global credo for reducing suffering and maximizing joy. www.raffinews.com</description>

      <description>In this last episode in the Awakening to Conscious Co-Creation series host Peter Tongue reviews and reflects upon the phenomenal insights and information that his guests have shared over the last twelve weeks.  Each one had brought their own awareness and interpretations of the shift in consciousness taking place as we approach the most fascinating time in Earth’s history.  Peter will bring his own understanding of this SHIFT and what he believes we need to do to become conscious co-creators as the Golden Era of Peace unfolds.

      <title>Spiritual Evolution and the True Nature of Reality</title>
      <description>As long as mankind has had conscious awareness, he has yearned to know and understand himself and the world around him. He has sought answers to questions about his true purpose here on Earth. Questions about his existence, and about God and his connection to this infinite Source. Questions about love, reality, life and death. What really happens to us when we die? Are heaven and hell real? And are we alone in this Universe or do other realities exist? One day, in September of 2004, sisters Tina Fiorda and Tilde Cameron were experimenting with a specific divining tool when they were contacted by their spirit guides. They were given instructions to begin meditating daily in preparation for the transmissions that would soon begin. One letter at a time their guides delivered the entirety of  “A Book of Insight.” Tina and Tilde discuss how they were contacted by their spirit guides and the messages their guides wish to impart. www.abookofinsight.com</description>

      <title>Open a Psychic Doorway to the Spirit World….</title>
      <description>That’s exactly what happened to Paul Elder following a near-death experience — a psychic doorway opened and his ordinary life has never been the same. Now, as a result of his spiritual experiences and publication of his book Eyes of an Angel, he will be known as a brave pioneer and outspoken advocate for the personal and scientific study of the spirit world around us. Passing repeatedly through that psychic doorway, Elder returned with a series of stunning revelations as to our true nature and purpose in the universe. Listen as Elder integrates near-death and out-of-body experiences in a way that has never been done before. www.paul-elder.com</description>

      <description>Darryl Gurney will discuss the importance of returning to a truly authentic, loving relationship with ourselves. He will explain exactly what SELF-LOVE is and talk about those unconscious beliefs and programs that prevent us from being whole and healed. Transformative healing modalities are available to release the deeply held, shame-based programs that separate us from the truth of who we are.  Darryl will use his expertise to describe how these healing tools work and why it is critical for us to return to self-love at this time. For more information visit www.health-quest.ca</description>

      <description>An important aspect of conscious co-creation with spirit is our connection with the natural landscapes of our beautiful planet. Richard Leviton uses his clairvoyance and visionary Geography to tune into the energy structures, portals and vortices that exist at sacred sites across the globe. He will discuss how these sites function and interact with and transform human consciousness.

      <title>Indigo Awakening: The Shift in Global Consciousness</title>
      <description>This episode is a “must” for all of parents and children who "don't fit into the regular systems of our world". Dr. Janine Talty, herself an Indigo and author of the well acclaimed book Indigo Awakening, will describe what it was like to grow up not “fitting in” and being unable to do traditional reading, writing and arithmetic. Her book tells the experience of Indigos from the inside out, and shows how their puzzling and painful experiences are paving the way for the emergence of a new way of being, in harmony with self, other, the world and the universe. Janine will share how, using her special gifts, she was able to negotiate her way through the obstacles on her path and become a successful osteopathic physician. Janine will also explain the role that the Indigos are playing in the shift in Global Consciousness at this critical time of awakening on the planet.

      <title>What In The World Is Going On?</title>
      <description>Most people do not understand the current world financial and economic crisis.  Robert Ayres predicted this crisis over three years ago as well as the current bear market rally. This challenging situation can be understood from four different perspectives: economic and financial market fundamentals, astrological cycles, world initiation and the evolution of consciousness, a paradigm shift that will fundamentally change society! We are at a significant crossroads in evolution that will result in change in many areas of life.  To the degree that we understand what is going on, why, and what needs to be done, we can each play our part in realigning our individual and collective lives.  We can choose to be in harmony with the change that is unfolding, or we can stay stuck in our old patterns.  Listen to this episode to learn more!</description>
