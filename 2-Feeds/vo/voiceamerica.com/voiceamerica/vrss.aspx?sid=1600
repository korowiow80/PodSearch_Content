    <title>Awakening Value: Shamanic Technologies of Consciousness and Success</title>
    <link>http://www.voiceamerica.com/rss/show/1600</link>
    <description>Imagine a technology that takes human consciousness to the next level – one that reveals a new understanding of what is valuable and possible in the abundant support of life. &lt;br&gt;
In fact, we already have the technology – the organizing principles of consciousness preserved in the wisdom of indigenous cultures. These principles unlock our highest creative capacities and fuel our leap into evolutionary action, individually and collectively. It's the leap we dream of in this age of global challenge. &lt;br&gt;
We need courageous individuals who have a passion to contribute at a collective level, and are available to learn and apply this technology in their arenas of genius and expertise. What we seek – better ways to create, govern, and live in harmony – will rise as we re-organize our individual and collective unconscious into active collective consciousness.</description>

      <title>Discover Your Patterns of Wisdom</title>
      <description>Anthony Lawlor, internationally known architect and author, joins me this week for the ultimate discussion – recognizing and using our patterns of wisdom. Consciousness, from a human perspective, is a magical weaving of thought patterns, behavior patterns, and emotional response patterns, and for every human being there are reservoirs of unique wisdom encoded in those patterns. Yet it’s hard for us to recognize this because we’ve trained our awareness to focus on the material world, and the patterns themselves, though precise, are intangible. We need a tool set that includes a tangible reference point in order to transit from the limited world of form to the limitless world of consciousness, vision, and innovative possibility. Anthony brings us that tool set in his latest book, The 24 Patterns of Wisdom: Navigating the Challenges and Awakenings of the Human Journey. In an inspired use of symbol, he shows us how patterns of energy and intelligence shape our human experience. Join us!</description>

      <title>Celebrating Your Purpose</title>
      <description>This week Dr. Bob Uslander, founder of www.DoctorsOnPurpose.com, joins me for a practical discussion of purpose, passion, and meaningful service as key ingredients for a fulfilled and joyful life. No doubt we have a plethora of books and seminars – all telling us how to find our calling and achieve happiness as individuals – but very few recognize a key link that makes Bob Uslander’s work unique. His understanding of the relationship between the individual and the collective and his insistence that any solution devised for one must work for the other are the ingredients that bring his work into the arena of consciousness and generate awakened value and success for his clients. In addition to being an experienced MD, he is a natural problem-solver and an entrepreneur – he knows how to deliver ‘prescriptions’ for living well, in joy, personally and professionally. Whether you’re in the health professions or another field, learn how to find your path of celebration and live on purpose.</description>

      <title>Our Place in the Nature of Things</title>
      <description>David McConville, media artist and director of the Worldviews Network joins me this week for a journey into the powers of human cognition and our capacity to know our universe, our place in it, and how our collective actions craft our future. Key to human thriving is our understanding of belonging, relationship, and interaction on all scales. Without this we remain fragmented, and we don’t fare well. In the Dagara tradition of West Africa they say our belonging is half of our identity, and without an experience of belonging there is no ‘home’ for the other half of our identity – our individual genius – to express its value or participate in evolving the world at a collective level. These are focal points for human consciousness – to experience high-level collective membership so individual creativity can contribute to the whole. The key for modern people is to risk the experience – it’s the path to regaining full consciousness – and experience is David McConville’s expertise. Join us!</description>

      <title>The Conscious Entrpreneur</title>
      <description>Malachi Leopold, founder of Left Brain/Right Brain Productions, joins me this week for an in-depth look at the power of entrepreneurship done right. The world ‘entrepreneur’ means being between the give and take. It means being the central driver of value creation and value exchange. It is a dynamic engagement that is at once collective and at the same time requires entrepreneurs to be fully attuned to the deep story and meaning of the arena and relationships that comprise the environment of their business engagements. Looking good isn’t enough; clever slogans aren’t enough; the widget or service alone isn’t enough. It’s becoming very clear in business these days that true change leaders must finally merge their authentic personal and professional selves and become masters of conscious relationship and collaboration. This is full consciousness in action, and as Malachi Leopold tells us, we can address the world’s challenges through conscious entrepreneurship and innovation. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Abundance: A Way of Being</title>
      <description>Jerry Michalski, founder of the REXpedition, joins me to dissolve old beliefs and unfold exciting new perspectives on abundance and how it’s actually created and sustained. In modern cultures we still tend to link abundance to doing the right thing so we’ll have enough to be safe and secure. We’ve woven money and material goods so tightly into our idea of abundance that we can barely separate them. Yet the ‘if I do this then I’ll have that’ approach is purely linear; in fact it’s the only approach we can perceive in linear awareness. It leaves us no alternatives; it doesn’t connect us to support networks or new economies. It’s only in full consciousness that the core organizing principles bring us into dimensional relationship networks whose soul purpose is to create and evolve abundance. Discover what this looks like in business and in life; learn what it is to source from being rather than doing. And tune in to discover the power of the REXpedition and your ability to BE abundant!</description>

      <title>Sufficiently Courageous!</title>
      <description>Join me this week for another engaging talk with Carol Dearborn, President of The Sufficiency Foundation. We’ll go beyond the concept of sufficiency into a discussion of value and authenticity. We are facing great challenges in the world today, and not all of them are being voiced. One of these challenges lies in our tendency to retreat into scarcity mentality, allowing ourselves to be guided by fear. Scarcity and fear are both hallmarks of isolated linear awareness; they rob us of our creative initiative and deplete what value we’ve generated. How do we find our way back to a state where we clearly perceive and generate life-enhancing value, instead of constantly giving up what we value most? To date, our approach has been verbal, and the limits of this are reflected back to us politically, financially, and socially. Talk is the currency of isolated awareness, and we need a new currency – a currency of authenticity, creativity, and courage to move beyond old ideas into new thriving.</description>

      <title>Your Visionary Skill!</title>
      <description>Join me this week for a revolutionary look at our human potential – our potential for greatness in using our innate visionary skills. Most people think of crystal balls, bewitching sticks, and other folk images when they hear the word ‘visionary’. But ‘visionary’ is a word that actually applies to the very human talent for knowing the world with incredible accuracy through the physical senses. This includes our uncanny ability to sense and know the invisible, intangible world of energies. The Dagara elders in West Africa say that we’re given 5 senses because we’re intended to have multiple views of the world at once – all the time. And all views are true at once, a fact that relational consciousness has no trouble with at all. But in the modern world we are using fewer and fewer of our senses to know the world, relying more and more on thought forms for our sense of what is really so, and it is causing us dire trouble. Tune in to find out what we are missing and how to get it back!</description>

      <title>Manifesting Happiness!</title>
      <description>Join me this week for a talk with Jordan Grader, co-founder of The Happiness Institute in San Francisco, where she works to help people explore what makes them come alive. There is a growing dialogue around well-being and happiness as primary ingredients in vital, sustainable societies and productive, meaningful entrepreneurship. Some of this dialogue is spurred by a growing sense that we simply aren’t getting enough in return for our efforts these days, but there is a deeper current that says we need to go about relating and creating in totally new ways – ways that are focused on waking us up so we come fully alive. ‘Coming alive’ means coming into vibrant creativity along with the momentum to manifest our ideas for a better world. That makes us happy! In a world that is increasingly fragmented, we are experiencing a tremendous amount of talent that has no bridge to manifestation. Jordan and her colleagues are building that bridge at The Happiness Institute. Tune in to learn more!</description>

      <title>Valuing the Human Factor</title>
      <description>Francis Cholle, founder of the Human Company, joins me to share his insights on business thinking and strategy, and discuss his tool for navigating the processes of conscious business – the groundbreaking Intuitive Compass™. Francis demonstrates in his work with leading CEO’s and their executive teams that our capacity for relational intelligence is indeed the source of our lasting success and ability to create sustainable value. He refers to this capacity as ‘intuitive intelligence – a new intelligence for the new economy’. The technologies of consciousness tell us that our unique role as humans is to steward the creation of well-being, and today more than ever, we have an opportunity to fulfill that role through conscious business. As Francis says, ‘Business is interrelated with all aspects of life (environment, society, economy) and cannot be thought of as the isolated pursuit of financial achievement.’ Join us for a fresh perspective on business and a unique way to awaken value!</description>

      <description>Jeff Klein, CEO of Working for Good and founding Trustee of Conscious Capitalism, joins me for a fresh look at business and its deepest purpose – to benefit society as a whole. Jeff says, At Working for Good, we believe business is a force for good and can foster flourishing for all.’ Jeff and his colleagues help their clients transform their businesses into aware, responsible enterprises – businesses that run on the same principles that organize consciousness. When your business runs on knowing ‘the process is the product’, knowing that the building of well-connected teams, stakeholders groups, and healthy company cultures is a requirement for thriving and for serving well, knowing that being in business and being human are inextricable, you are engaged in conscious business. You are also poised to participate in the great transformation occurring now, a transformation in the ways we create meaning, generate value, and supply benefit to society at large. Tune in, join the discussion!</description>

      <title>Policies for a Shareable City</title>
      <description>Neal Gorenflo, co-founder of Shareable.net, joins me this week to discuss a remarkable and timely expression of consciousness at work – his new Policies for a Shareable City. Modern humans are becoming city dwellers, community members, which means we have a unique opportunity. If you bring awareness to just a few of the core principles of consciousness – membership, unconditional acceptance, reciprocity, mutually supportive connectivity – you have the foundation for a thriving, sharable city. What’s more, cities are collectives that thrive on a scale where the static forces of large infrastructures do not so easily overwhelm productive decision-making and action. But we need to learn to recognize the opportunity. Neal states, ‘What’s unique here at Shareable is that we believe cities will only deliver on the promise for change if they are conceived as commons, as places to share.’ Tune in! Discover where we’re on the right path and where we stop ourselves from creating a great future.</description>

      <title>Flames of Consciousness</title>
      <description>Burning Man: the mysterious annual desert project created by 50,000+ participants conjures visions of fiery Pagan cults, ragged dust-blown hippies, and wild freeform artists. The reality is ‘Burners’ are people consciously living a life of radical inclusion, self-reliance, civic responsibility, participatory culture, and immediacy. What makes Burning Man unique, and why would you want to travel to a hot, dry alkaline lake bed to witness a 40-foot tall wooden man explode into flames? Independent producer, designer, writer and business owner Geoff Puckett joins us to talk about his recent experience in Black Rock City, the once-a-year name of Nevada's 7th largest urban center. We’ll explore Burning Man's 10 Principles along with the very real, deeply emotional transformation attendees experience. You'll learn how living for a week in a realm absent of civilized masks, and full of genuine love, endless creative outlets, empowers consciousness and gives us new perspectives on our world.</description>

      <title>A Lineage of Thriving</title>
      <description>Renee Baribeau, consultant, author, and founder of Desert Holistic Network, returns to Awakening Value™ to discuss the wisdom traditions and our need for lineage. In indigenous lineages, the knowledge needed for thriving is kept alive through a process called initiation – a multi-stage, guided process that begins with individual maturation, then the gifting of power and knowledge, followed by the initiate using that knowledge in service. Eventually, the initiate becomes the living embodiment of the culture’s wisdom, all the while stewarding its evolution. This is lineage. Young indigenous people now rush to be Western, to benefit from the new things we offer, but these things don’t include the wisdom of thriving. Today, in a globally connected world, we must realize that the wisdom of conscious thriving can’t be withheld or forgotten. It must be transmitted to evolve modern cultures. It is now our responsibility to become the lineage – the ones who remember and evolve ways to thrive.</description>

      <title>Conscious Enterprise, Optimal Life</title>
      <description>Brian Johnson, Chief Philosopher of PhilosophersNotes and founder of en*theos Academy for Optimal Living, joins us this week to focus on the role of the conscious entrepreneur in transforming our world. Discussions of consciousness are on the rise these days. We want to know about conscious business, leadership, economies and more, but do we really know what we’re saying? It’s one thing to learn and repeat some truths of consciousness. It’s quite another to put them into practice, to use their power and nurture the outcomes that are truly awakened and abundant, as opposed to those that only echo the ideas. Wisdom is knowledge embodied; it is the power of an awakened creativity that consciousness uses to generate the next level of innovation, success, and optimal living. Brian is not only a master of embodying wisdom to create conscious business, he is in the business of creating opportunities for you to learn and create in the same way, consciously bringing optimal enterprise to life.</description>

      <title>Getting Radical!</title>
      <description>Environmentalist, economist, and instigator of conscious global action, Manuel Maqueda joins us on Awakening Value™ to talk about ‘getting radical’. As Co-founder of Plastic Pollution Coalition and member of Midway Journey, Manuel tells us we’re destroying the balances on which nature depends by tossing countless man-made products into our environment, oblivious to the damage we inflict. The devastating effects of our discarded plastic items alone are radical, and Manuel tells us that our response must be radical in turn. By ‘radical’ he means returning to the root of our beingness, remembering our place in the great system of life, and acting as conscious stewards of that system. In Manuel’s words, we must heal all of our relationships – with one another, with the environment, and with the whole web of life. He asks us, ‘If we really heal these, what speech will come out of our mouths, what kind of structures will we create?’ Turn on your imaginations, open your hearts, and tune in!</description>

      <title>Wisdom and the Beauty of Being Human</title>
      <description>Join me this week for a profound conversation about wisdom, beauty, and being human. To the indigenous mind, the capacity to create is natural to human consciousness, and mastery of consciousness creates, for a culture and all of its members, both a continuity of identity and a dependable pathway of evolutionary thriving through life’s natural cycles of change and transformation. The word art has its origins in the Old French and Latin ars, meaning ‘craftsmanship’. And it’s intriguing to note that those three letters – a-r-t – are also an Old English form of the verb ‘to be’. Even more intriguing are the many early human languages that had neither the verb ‘to be’ nor a word for art. In fact, ‘being’ was originally understood as ‘being conscious’. If you were alive in this world there was no way you could ‘not be’ and an indigenous Shakespeare would have crafted a much different inquiry.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Being – the Time is Now!</title>
      <description>This week Nosakhare Richard Osabuohien of Help Beyond Borders, and Maureen Kelsey, internationally known global strategy consultant, come to Awakening Value™ to tell you an extraordinary story of compassionate people joining hands around the world to help an infant in need of heart surgery. It’s a story that encapsulates all that is wrong with the world and all that can be set right, beginning now. This story is about our need to flow abundance, to distribute wealth and resources such that everyone is taken care of and no calcified organizational system stands in the way. As an organizing principle of consciousness, fluidity will always speak its own best structure. Now imagine that we simply begin to flow resources where they are needed. Such visionary action will begin to produce well-being, because it is conscious. Such visionary action will surface innovative organizational maps of thriving, because it is conscious. Imagine – now is the time, and this story is the seed. Join us!</description>

      <title>Encore Presentation: What are all the machines for?</title>
      <description>Malidoma Patrice Somé, internationally honored Dagara elder and teacher, joins me this week for THE discussion about technology. We’ve reached a point in our evolution as a species where we’re faced with an extraordinary choice – to lead the next wave of evolutionary growth . . . or not. The cresting edge of this wave lies at the frontiers of consciousness. Yet we’re so fixated on our idea of physical technology as the only vehicle for advancement, we’ve blinded ourselves to the very source of all that machinery – constantly evolving consciousness! Our physical technology is no longer solving our problems. Our ideas are not keeping pace with our challenges. Learning to ‘wake up’, to participate in the evolution of consciousness, puts us in the stream of an energy technology that delivers elegant, efficient ways to produce more abundance and success than we’ve managed or dreamt to date, ways that are at the same time loving, compassionate, and inclusive. No one gets left out. Join us!</description>

      <title>Encore Presentation: At the Leading Edge of Change</title>
      <description>Tune in this week when Alexander Caillet, Partner at Accompli Group, joins us to share his expertise in helping leaders become true change leaders, capable of growing their companies into flexible, collaborative organizations that create abundance through the mastery of change. The world is changing at a fast clip in the 21st century. We often speak of the leading edge of change and our need to ride that edge with skill, because that is where we’re evolving, where our ideas manifest. Only our ability to recognize high-value vision keeps us thriving at our growing edge, and that is an ability we only mature in full consciousness. Alexander is one of those rare visionaries whose natural talent has allowed him to source from the depth and breadth of full consciousness where the organizing principles are at work. He says, ‘Change begins with a different way of seeing. Mastering change requires seeing what is essential.’ Tune in for a remarkable example of full consciousness in action.</description>

      <title>Thriving as a Way of Life</title>
      <description>Jean Russell, founder of Thrivable, Inc, joins us this week for a discussion about thriving as a way of life. Driven by her insight that our lack of collaboration keeps us from flourishing, she has developed groundbreaking programs and learning materials to assist entrepreneurs, social innovators, and business builders in reaching beyond the ordinary to craft high-value collective solutions. With volatile global economies and a world more full of questions than viable answers, the concept of thriving may seem out of reach, but there are truths we must recognize. One truth is that thriving is a direct outcome of full consciousness. In organizing our awareness and interactions by the principles of consciousness we produce environments and collaborative conditions that lead to thriving. Jean Russell’s profound contribution is to make these truths accessible in the most practical and innovative ways. She offers us pathways to creating a world that works.

      <title>Redesigning Consumerism</title>
      <description>Diane Osgood PhD, head of Osgood Sustainability Consulting, joins me this week to discuss new parameters for our most challenging growing edges: sustainability, consumerism, and the far-reaching benefits of transparency. Our patterns in these areas have become fixed, and to investigate alternatives we need to look at the mentality – or consciousness – that holds the patterns in place. As Diane says, we perceive sustainability in terms of limits, not opportunity; and we are consuming beyond our means, which places us not just in financial debt, but in debt to our planet and our communities. No financial advisor would advise us to consume beyond our financial means, so what drives us to do this with our natural and human resources? From new models for business to profound new visions for value creation and consumption, Diane offers us new meaning and models for crafting exchanges that produce truly awakened value and vibrant well-being for business, communities, and beyond. Tune in!</description>

      <title>The New Hero’s Journey</title>
      <description>Join me this week as we continue our discussion of the Hero’s Journey – a deep inquiry into the nature of our modern identities, values, and creative responsibilities. We know we’re faced with unique challenges in the world today, from unpredictable economies, to rapidly reforming value networks, to the sudden dissolution of previously dependable climate patterns and the life/work modalities that have been defined by those patterns. It looks, feels, and sounds as though we’re being called to save the world again, but will our familiar identity of the Hero and our propensity for ‘doing’ be sufficient to the day? Or will we need to drop to a deeper level, where awareness is primary, in order to find the wisdom, strength, and continuity that is required to thrive through radical change? We’ll talk about reshaping the legacy of humankind using our innate genius for achieving states of abundance and well-being – all by allowing ourselves to be claimed by the New Hero’s journey. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Disruptive Technologies: A New Consciousness</title>
      <description>Charlene Li, founder of Altimeter Group, joins me this week for an in-depth discussion of the fast-evolving landscape of new digital technologies and their impact on business today. Called disruptive technologies, these new digital solutions are introducing new ways of connecting, communicating, and measuring success in business, and in the process they are redefining what has value and how that value is created. At Altimeter Group, Charlene and her partners help companies ‘stay on top of disruptive technologies’ by designing digital strategies to enhance company goals. The real brilliance of her work lies in her basic advice: Focus on the relationships, not the technologies. This is a call to return to an organizing principle of consciousness, and it suggests that these new technologies are not so much disruptive as they are dimensional. They are calling for added dimension in leadership, empowerment, and openness of spirit and intent that only full consciousness can support. Tune in</description>

      <title>Encore Presentation: Instinct Always Wins!</title>
      <description>This week Francis Cholle – world-renowned advisor to Fortune 100 CEOs and one of the most creative minds in business – joins me for a deep discussion of our most valuable human asset and the role it can play in launching your business from the ordinary into the extraordinary. This asset is an aspect of human awareness, and we have lots of names for it. We call it intuition, instinct, relational intelligence, or luminous awareness if you’re a shaman. These terms all refer to the same capacity – to know and create in relational awareness – which has always allowed us to achieve far beyond the limits of logic and linear approaches. If you think you just need to ‘gear up’, get things back under control, or simply analyze the plan again, Francis has wonderful, surprising advice for you on how to reinvent your business model, boost innovation, and accelerate profitable change in your company. He is truly a master of the organizing principles of consciousness. Don’t miss this dialogue!</description>

      <title>It’s a Question of Inquiry</title>
      <description>Join me this week for a look at how we ask questions, how we discover, and how we come to know who we are, what’s possible, and what our best choices really are. As humans we are seekers, inventors, and explorers – talented at bringing what we imagine into being, gifted at manifesting dreams. When we’re being successful we’re actually involved in intelligent inquiry that connects us directly to the world, keeping us informed and available to possibility. When we are not successful we are asking our questions and investigating our world in a radically different way – one that confines us to repeating ourselves and blinds us to what is possible. It’s all a question of inquiry, and consciousness, of course. How we seek to discover, to know, and to create is totally dependent on our state of consciousness, and as it turns out we are wired for genius ¬– it’s just that our genius doesn’t operate the way we think! Tune in for a surprising explanation of how we can create success in our world</description>

      <title>Your Genius, Your Hero, Your Open Heart</title>
      <description>Jordan Paul, PhD joins me this week for a heart to heart talk about our most powerful human attribute – our capacity to open our hearts, and in doing so, become a source of connection and abundance in a world too full of disconnection, scarcity, and fear. Indigenous elders will tell you that everything we seek is found through the heart. What we require for a good life is grown and matured through heart connections and evolved to its next expression through love, sheer joy, and a hunger for mystery. There is only one thing in the universe that can hold this level of power and magic – the open human heart – and it is our journey in life to come to know our own sensing, intelligent heart, for only in that knowing can we open to a fulfilled life. Jordan Paul guides us into the heart’s powerful territory as we discuss his book, ‘Becoming Your Own Hero’. Be introduced to the real hero we’re all looking for, the one who draws wisdom and success from failure, the one who lives in your heart.</description>

      <title>Empowering the World: Global US Solar</title>
      <description>I always teach my students that imagination and vision are simply words for our genius in using experiential intelligence. In the moment of imagining a new idea, you’re experiencing it, and if you pay attention, you’ll come to know it enough to act on it. Your vision is your experiential proof. Even so, someone always asks, ‘Can you give me an example of that?’ This week I give you George Galvan, Founder and CEO of Global US Solar, a shining example of full human consciousness in action, with all its genius and generosity manifesting global scale visions to help others, never diverted by doubt or lack of previous proof. In fact, every idea George brings to the fore generates the next abundance-producing idea, along with the positive energy that provides the momentum for manifesting. His story is a story of consciousness in action. He is intelligent, open-hearted, and in the business of generating well-being. If you want to be inspired and see what consciousness can really do, tune in!</description>

      <description>Ross Evans, inventor of the Xtracycle and founder of Worldbike, returns to Awakening Value™ to share his deepest insights on passion and how it seeks to make relationship with us. Here is the simple truth: everyone has a unique genius – some unique talent – and this talent has a life force called passion. Passion is also an organizing principle of consciousness, so when we connect with our passion, we discover our unique talent and simultaneously, are organized into full consciousness, infused with energy! Passion delivers big insights and innovative ideas – the ones we so often push away, telling ourselves it’s too radical, it won’t work, we don’t have time. Yet those big passionate ideas have a way of coming back to us. They track us like a jaguar tracks for food – circling and always returning to get our attention. How do we say yes to this enormous power? Join us for a refreshing and empowering look at human genius, how it speaks to us, and how to let your passion find you!</description>

      <title>The Best Investment You’ll Ever Make!</title>
      <description>Geoff Puckett, expert Experience Producer, joins me this week to talk about the best investment instrument ever – your own imagination! This is the investment we dream of – it produces unlimited upside returns, both in terms of tangible and intangible asset value! Why do I call it an investment? Because unleashing the full power of your imagination requires input – of your awareness, your curiosity, yes, some time, and a certain amount of energy – and it all goes to you. The ROI for this investment in yourself is higher consciousness, higher IQ, greater creativity, more time [we’ll explain that one] and even more energy. Sounds like magic, but it’s dependable magic. Imagination is a vital aspect of consciousness, a technology that everyone is gifted with, and as Arthur C. Clarke reminds us, ‘Any technology sufficiently advanced appears magical’. Tune in for an amazing conversation about the full powers of imagination – what it does for us, and why it’s the one investment we must make.</description>

      <title>The Real Question, The Real Answer</title>
      <description>Tune in this week when Jerry Michalski, thought leader and founder of the remarkable REXpedition, joins me for a look at the one question we really need to be asking ourselves – and answering – now! Jerry is going to pose an astonishing question, and how we answer this question determines how we behave, what we believe, what we can imagine, and what we are willing to do. It is the deciding factor in whether we can actually implement the new insights that are coming to the fore in business, governance, and social action – and it centers on trust. In ordinary states of consciousness, trust follows experience, which leaves us demanding proof of an idea or intent before we take meaningful action. This is slowing us down to the point where we’re unable to keep pace with the forces that are changing our world. In full consciousness, trust is actually an organizing principle. What happens when we have the courage to reorganize our consciousness first? What emerges? Join us this week!</description>

One of the greatest challenges we face today is simply keeping up with the pace of change and the emergence of new information and challenges. If we’re not educated in the ways of full consciousness, we’ll be caught in the limits of linear awareness. We’ll have access to our familiar methods and ideas, but not to our imaginations or collective power. This is what produces overwhelm and blinds us to successful action in our fast-changing world. Laurent and his team have drawn directly on indigenous wisdom to develop collaborative processes for innovation in business. This is the power of collective consciousness, and when it’s unleashed, large-scale collaboration, innovation, and success are the natural outcomes. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Mission Possible!</title>
      <description>Marti gives you some straight talk about living to thrive again – how raising your level of consciousness transforms your life and work, and the world! Join me this week for some straight talk about consciousness and the principles that literally organize us. They organize our perception, awareness, relationships, creativity, and actions in ways that produce only thriving. We talk a lot about sustainability, thriving, and how to make ourselves act in sustainable ways. We even realize that, inherently, nature already does this. Yet for ourselves, we still believe it’s a real Mission IMpossible – nice to imagine but we won’t really change, and there’s too much complexity to produce widespread well-being. However, the essential message on Awakening Value™ has always been that organizing our consciousness by its core principles transforms our visions of a thriving world into reality, without struggle or wasted effort. Hard to believe? Probably . . .</description>

      <title>Remarkable Leadership: A State of Being</title>
      <description>Dr Keith Merron, founder and Managing Partner of Avista Consulting Group, joins me this week for a revealing discussion about leadership – what we know about the leadership position, what makes a leader truly remarkable, and why we have so few great leaders in the world today. In the wisdom traditions, the common understanding is that success rises when we become our knowledge, when the wisdom we gain as we grow expertise in life and work literally becomes our way of being and relating. This truth is not held so much as a goal, the way we think about goal-setting these days, but rather as a deep collective memory of our most natural state of being, a state that produces the most value-filled, resilient, creative, and productive outcomes on an ongoing basis. Keith Merron takes us directly into the gap that lies between our tremendous knowledge of leadership and the results we’re producing. As with all things in consciousness, the space between is where discoveries are made. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: Invaluable Technology the Conscious Collective</title>
      <description>‘We have no choice but to allow ourselves to be reclaimed by the collective.’ This astonishing statement from a Q’ero elder is at the core of our dialogue this week as we reconsider our beliefs about collectives – how they function and the role of individuals who comprise them. We’ll take a look at how the nature of business collectives is changing today, yet we’ll have to reach for the stars to understand this elder’s teaching. We have no choice because the ultimate collective is consciousness itself, and it is rising. Great human collectives are successful in the same way consciousness is successful – always exercising experiential intelligence to create multi-level interconnectivities, which in turn are used to fuel and manifest innovative benefit at all levels within the system, for all parts of the system. Only something with a heart and soul can exercise this kind of intelligence for its own evolution and success. Join me in this discussion of the vital technology of collectives</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: What are all the machines for?</title>
      <description>Malidoma Patrice Somé, internationally honored Dagara elder and teacher, joins me this week for THE discussion about technology. We’ve reached a point in our evolution as a species where we’re faced with an extraordinary choice – to lead the next wave of evolutionary growth . . . or not. The cresting edge of this wave lies at the frontiers of consciousness. Yet we’re so fixated on our idea of physical technology as the only vehicle for advancement, we’ve blinded ourselves to the very source of all that ‘machinery’ – constantly evolving consciousness! Our physical technology is no longer solving our problems. Our ideas are not keeping pace with our challenges. Learning to ‘wake up’, to participate in the evolution of consciousness, puts us in the stream of an energy technology that delivers elegant, efficient ways to produce more abundance and success than we’ve managed or dreamt to date, ways that are at the same time loving, compassionate, and inclusive. No one gets left out. Join us</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: The Art of Convening</title>
      <description>Craig and Patricia Neal join me this week to discuss their new book, The Art of Convening: Authentic Engagement in Meetings, Gatherings, and Conversations. The productive functioning of a collective is dependent on raising the levels of connectivity and consciousness within the collective itself. The indigenous view is that each member of a collective must participate, and in turn, is then acknowledged and nourished by the group. This suggests a unique dimensionality exists in great collective work, an aspect that we usually dismiss in favor of older, more linear ideas of leading and controlling a group’s behaviors and actions. Craig and Patricia bring their decades of experiential wisdom, gained through their brilliant Thought Leader Gatherings series, meetings of great minds that they have convened in Minnesota and California over many years. They will surprise and delight you with their wise and heartful approach to collective work. Tune in; discover the powerful art of convening.</description>

      <title>Reshaping the Hero’s Journey</title>
      <description>As consciousness rises in the world today, new dimensions of possibility are opening up: in the ways we connect, the things we discover, and the technologies we use to shape our world. Yet our state of awareness is not keeping pace. One of the amazing truths about consciousness is that we can be asleep to the dimensional workings of our relational intelligence, yet still be somewhat aware of what it imagines and knows. The problem is, in our usual state of linear awareness we’re in flatland. We just can’t see all the dimensions of our capacity to adapt and grow; we mistake the nature of our journey in life. We call it the Hero’s journey and see it as a linear path to arriving someplace. The truth is that we’re on a dimensional journey of becoming, not arriving. Our individual advancement has been vital, but now our job is to give our genius back into a greater collective, wide awake in all dimensions. Tune in as we use metaphor and poetry to reshape our great Hero’s journey, together.</description>

      <title>You Might as Well be Thinking Big, Part 2</title>
      <description>Join me this week when Carol Dearborn, artist and President of the Sufficiency Foundation, joins me for a new perspective on thinking big. We began our discussion of thinking big last October, and we found that in order to think big you have to see big. This in turn means that we have to remember a critical fact. Thinking is a process that is carried out in relational awareness, and the thought forms we cling to are the end-products of that process. When we ask, as we love to do, how do we do something, or why should we do something, we’re in a state of awareness that is decidedly not big. We are asking where the answers are, but we’re not in the state of awareness where the answers are created! We’re just waiting for them to show up, and such passivity won’t work. We need to finally learn how to shift states of awareness. Then our endless how and why will dissolve and the solutions will actually appear. Tune in for an eye-opening discussion of how we can wake up and truly think big!</description>

      <title>At the Leading Edge of Change</title>
      <description>Tune in this week when Alexander Caillet, Partner at Accompli Group, joins us to share his expertise in helping leaders become true change leaders, capable of growing their companies into flexible, collaborative organizations that create abundance through the mastery of change. The world is changing at a fast clip in the 21st century. We often speak of the leading edge of change and our need to ride that edge with skill, because that is where we’re evolving, where our ideas manifest. Only our ability to recognize high-value vision keeps us thriving at our growing edge, and that is an ability we only mature in full consciousness. Alexander is one of those rare visionaries whose natural talent has allowed him to source from the depth and breadth of full consciousness where the organizing principles are at work. He says, ‘Change begins with a different way of seeing. Mastering change requires seeing what is essential.’ Tune in for a remarkable example of full consciousness in action.</description>

      <title>Human Genius: Creating Cultures of Value</title>
      <description>Wade Davis – world-renowned ethnographer, author, photographer, and filmmaker – joins me this week for a profound discussion of human genius and the invaluable experiential knowledge held in indigenous cultures. If you’re a regular listener to these dialogues, you know that experiential knowledge is collective knowledge – gained through direct experience of the environment, used to create collective states of well-being, and in turn kept alive by the culture it serves. But you’re also learning that we no longer live in a state of collective awareness. We are linear – our models for success are linear, our vision is linear, and we live in opposition to the cycles of nature, unable to perceive the part we play in driving devastating global change, both environmental and cultural. At stake is literally our own survival. What will it take for us to value culture, to learn from the elders who hold humankind’s wisdom for crafting evolutionary success? Tune in for an unforgettable discussion</description>

      <title>Reflections on the Bottom Line</title>
      <description>Join me this week for a fresh look at where we are today in relationship to ourselves, to business, and to our world. Extreme events are occurring all around us, from enormous earthquakes literally moving island nations, to entire populations demanding democratic governance. Such dynamic and radical change demands our attention at much higher levels of consciousness. These changes bring with them larger questions that beg us to enter larger conversations and reflect in ways we’ve nearly forgotten how to do. The primary question is not about how we are to do anything. Rather it is about our ability to hold radically new experiential knowledge in awareness, reflect on it, and create with it. An indigenous person would ask whether our container is strong enough to hear the messages rising from the radical events occurring in the world. Tune in to learn about this container of awareness and how it will help us release our reductionist bottom-line view of the world and move forward.</description>

      <title>Memory, meaning, and love</title>
      <description>Join me this week for an in-depth look at the beauty and power of human nature – our capacity to learn and remember, to infuse experience with meaning, to create, and amazing as it may seem sometimes, to love unconditionally. Of course these attributes of human nature often elude us. They’re not visible or fully accessible when we’re isolated in our linear minds, strategizing and rationalizing our way through the day. Yet even as the ordinary mind tries to reassure us by keeping us focused on the familiar and steering clear of change, it also has a bare memory that we’re meant to explore magnificent frontiers of the heart and mind. Somewhere in our bones we know that to be truly successful and happy in life we must be fully available, negotiable, and open-hearted. We’re wired to learn, create, and thrive. We’re wired to bond in love. We just need to unravel a few mysteries of consciousness in order to remember our deepest genius, purpose, and capacity to evolve magnificently.</description>

      <description>John L. Petersen, founder of The Arlington Institute [TAI], joins me this week for a look at a future full of big change and wild cards, a future arriving on our collective doorstep as we speak. When the shock of unpredictable change shows up, our first thought is usually ‘Wait, I’m not prepared for this!’ and our first question is always ‘What do I do now!?’ But the indigenous response is deeper and broader: preparation alone has nothing to do with the reality of riding the waves of change. Becoming masters of availability and vision are the keys. These skills allow us to craft our responses before the wild cards of change leave us floundering. At TAI, John Petersen and his teams operate on the premise that ‘effective thinking about the future is impossible without casting a very wide net’. And that net operates on the interwoven organizing principles of consciousness. Join us to discover how we can loosen ourselves from the binds of linear awareness and craft a truly great future.</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: Prescription for the World: Your Transformative Sensing Intelligence</title>
      <description>Joining me this week is Emmy Award winning composer and producer Gary Malkin, master of the emerging genre of Transformational Media – unique combinations of music, imagery, and spoken wisdom calibrated to open sensing awareness. This is precisely the same as opening relational awareness, the key to coming alive and living well. Last week we spoke about ‘thinking big’ and found out that it really means ‘sensing big’, but if you’re living in the stress lane, your sensory intelligence is actually off-line. Without a full bandwidth of sensory awareness the human psyche contracts; we become fearful, ill, and we fight against the world, losing touch with the vast experiential wisdom we carry. The only cure is direct sensing itself! Through the art of transformational media Gary has developed astonishing tools for healing, initiating, and maturing our sensory intelligence. With this maturation we regain our multi-dimensional connection to ourselves, to one another, and the world. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Living Your Way to Success!</title>
      <description>This week Sonia Choquette joins me for a compassionate look at our most basic, and most marvelous, human capacities – to be in love with life and to thrive! These are actually organizing principles of consciousness, meaning that in a fully awakened state our natural way of being is to connect and thrive in universal love, to have faith in our sensory perceptions of the world, and to act from the wisdom of primary imagination [often called intuition] knowing it always shows us the path to states of fulfillment. Sonia is a world-renowned vibrational alchemist, intuitive consultant, and spirited teacher who understands the limitations we are subject to in modern consciousness, both individual and collective. She also understands how to help people connect with the world through all six senses and experience the full dimensionality of success life has to offer. Tune in for an amazing journey into the realms of personal transformation and Sonia’s wisdom in the ways of living fully awake.</description>

      <title>Currencies for 21st Century Success</title>
      <description>Join me this week for a fascinating conversation with Arthur Brock, Founder/Developer of The MetaCurrency Project, whose mission is to bring relational intelligence to the design and function of collectives, whether that collective is a software system or the system of people we call a business. The idea of currency enters the picture when we realize that within a healthy system there must be multiple levels of exchange occurring all the time, and each level or type of exchange requires a unique ‘currency’, which has its own ‘measure’. In the modern world, we understand the success of an exchange by applying a linear measure. In business that measure is dollars, a reductionist approach that is all linear awareness allows. We miss the dimensions of value that intangible properties give us; we miss the richness of new interrelationships that can spark innovation and growth. Tune in! Discover the value and power of redefining currency, relationships, and assets for 21st century success!</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: INTENT: the ‘How’ in ‘How do I do that?’</title>
      <description>Do you want to know how to get things done? This week I’ll share with you the secret ‘tool’ shamans have always used to get things done – intent! You need intent to do anything truly powerful in life. You need it to blossom yourself and craft a healed state for your body-mind; you need it to create a great business! In the technologies of consciousness, intent is not an abstract concept, nor is it the least bit subject to your inner critic, or to doubt or opinion. Intent is a tool, a primary organizing principle. In western culture we’re always asking, ‘How do I do that?’ We want the instruction book first, and then we’ll think about giving things a try. This leaves us at the mercy of whoever we turn to for those instructions. It leaves us lacking direct relationship with our own creative genius. Intent will plug you back in to your own best resource, your unique skills and vision. And intent will open you to the collective level of consciousness, which is where things really get done</description>

      <description>This week LaTosha Brown, Executive Director of the Gulf Coast Fund, and Fund Advisor Derrick Evans join me for an informative talk about how to do things right. The Gulf Oil Spill is one of the worst environmental, social, and economic disasters in US history. If you’re following the news, you’ve seen and heard the progression of the blame game, pitting one organization against another, government against industry, leader against leader. This is the outcome of living in linear awareness – we see the parts but have little, if any, unbiased view of the whole and how it operates. We are all ‘collective’ – part of a very large system called life – and what we do affects the value and potential of everything in the system. To thrive into the future we must become collective in our awareness, relationships, and actions. LaTosha and Derrick will guide us through the real story of the Gulf Spill and the lessons we need to learn. Tune in for a rich conversation with these eloquent leaders.</description>

      <description>Language is a unique human skill, one of our most powerful tools for transformation. Join me this week when Renee Baribeau, Director of Desert Holistic Network, and Stephanie Gunning, author, editor, and writing coach, share their expertise on language and the art of self-expression as a tool, not just for personal discovery and awakening, but for unleashing our genius and transforming our lives into journeys of fulfillment. Language, both oral and written, has always encoded our most advanced knowledge. We use it not only to express outwardly, but also to connect, remember, and explore the depths of our consciousness. It is these deep regions that are home to our wisdom voice, our source for transformation. Here we have the power to evolve and maintain continuity because we’re working from the grounded roots of our experiential knowledge. Don’t miss this conversation! From the mystical to the scientific Stephanie and Renee will show you how to unleash your wisdom voice and transform!</description>

      <description>Join me this week for an energizing, optimistic, and practical conversation with futurist David Houle, founder of EvolutionShift.com, and marketing expert Arman Rousta, CEO of Blueliner. We’ll investigate the forces that are rapidly reshaping our world and offer you the smartest ways to put those forces to work on your behalf. Key to positioning ourselves for success in a fast-changing world are keeping a visionary ‘bead’ on the rising forces of change – new meaning and value – and using these forces to evolve the ways we connect, communicate, create, and serve. But to release the old and evolve to the new, we require an underlying source of continuity – not a static source, but one that evolves with us as we go about evolving our world. The creative matrix of the organizing principles of consciousness provides this. David Houle calls for a shift to principle-driven decisions, and Arman Rousta shows us what this looks like when we set out to make a difference in the world. Tune in!</description>

      <description>The year’s end is a time when we reflect on what has been and make promises for what is to come, yet most of us are unaware that there is a way to empower our thoughts and turn them into active engagements in the world. All that’s required is that we actually complete what needs completing! One of the most surprising powers in the technologies of consciousness is the wisdom of cycles of action – gathering insight for innovation, taking action to the fullest expression, and bringing action to its most beneficial completion. In nature you would be hard pressed to find anything that doesn’t live by this technology. In business you’ll find the most successful people doing the same thing. Peter Drucker’s mastery of ‘systematic innovation’ and ‘systematic abandonment’ are examples. Unaware of the requirement for full completions, we end up dragging old energies with us that make each successive attempt to act harder. Instead of breaking a cycle, learn how to complete one! Tune in this week!</description>

      <description>The shamans say that in order to live and relate well, our very beingness must rise from a place of beauty, power, and radiance. With all the depressing news that surrounds us in the media, it may be hard to remember that we still have access to anything like beauty, power, or radiance. Yet at the heart of shamanic technologies of consciousness and success lies a powerful tool that not only connects us with the beauty and grace we long for, but grows our capacity to call in what we dream of – individually and collectively. This simple tool is the exercising of gratitude – and it is truly an exercise that pays you back 10-fold and more. Of course we’re not talking about voicing platitudes. We’re talking about an extraordinary technology of creative communication and exchange that has the potential to stream into your life what you require to thrive, and gift you the miracle of membership in the collective of all living things. Tune in this week and learn how to exercise gratitude!</description>

      <description>This week Philena Bruce, author of the amazing book ‘Know That You Are Loved’ returns to Awakening Value™ to tell us more about her journey into the heart of love. In the Andean traditions the principle of universal love lies at the core of consciousness. It is the bridge to membership, to our belonging in community; it is the secret ingredient in all interactions that gives rise to states of fulfillment. Love is the opener of doorways, the healer, and the magician who brings dreams to life. Yet in modern life love can be so elusive, or at best so conditional that all the joy is squeezed out of it. Philena, through a series of remarkable and courageous personal explorations, literally found Love and realized its true nature. It’s always present, a universal force constantly supporting us, and from the core of our being love infuses our energy and literally connects us to the world. Philena shares her wisdom on how we can always be connected by love in a network of affection. Tune in!</description>

      <description>Jerry Michalski, founder of REX, the Relationship Economy eXpedition, joins me for an invaluable talk about the future of economies and value. We know that a major portion of business value now lies in intangible assets, and it’s no longer just intellectual property. Now we include the actual relationships on which businesses depend, and relationships are becoming a primary currency in a world where societal well-being and support of the common good are gaining in value. The proliferation of connectivity we experience in our wireless world is driving massive social and economic changes, and we need to be awake to the resultant shifts in value. What are the new sources of value? How do traditional commerce and the new economies of asset sharing for the ‘commons’ work together? We’ll always need a currency to formalize our exchanges, and the Relationship Economy gives us a fresh map to explore a new world where the currency isn’t always dollars, and the structures are no longer top-down</description>

      <title>Accounting for Consciousness</title>
      <description>This week Peter Russell joins me for a journey into the question of consciousness itself. As a world-renowned author, speaker, physicist, mathematician, and experimental psychologist, Peter offers us unique insights into human consciousness and its role in the universal scheme of things. Consciousness has become the buzzword of the day. We like to think that we’ve become awakened global citizens, exhibiting new ‘conscious’ behaviors so we’re sure to look the part. Yet culturally, we remain bound in linear awareness, busily mistaking our thoughts for direct experience, ever asleep to relational awareness where all the creativity really occurs – uniquely human creativity that, as Peter points out, has become a driving force in evolution more powerful than genetics. With this much influence, humans are accountable at a level that modern cultures refuse to recognize, and if we’re at the wheel we can’t afford to be asleep! Is our awakening the next ‘product’ of human consciousness? Tune in</description>

      <description>This week we’ll be talking with Ross Evans – inventor, adventurer, humanitarian, and design catalyst. His amazing passion for discovery dissolves the limits of the known world and fully reveals what’s possible at the leading edge of creativity. His inventions have helped thousands of people, given birth to businesses, and inspired other creative geniuses. And he wants to inspire you too! Ross holds the vision of a world organized to receive and support creative ideas, right through the production phase. He is on a mission to help others find their own leading edge of passion and go to work there. Of course, the technologies show us that there is never just one edge – no cliff to fear. There are always complementarities meeting at an active interface where everything required for manifesting ideas will always show up. Ross has discovered this and many other truths about full consciousness. Don’t miss this important conversation with a master of creative multiplicity and awakened value.</description>

      <description>We would all do well to follow this advice from the Sufi poet Rumi. Matthew and Terces Engelhart did just that when they founded Café Gratitude – a pure manifestation of the principles of consciousness, sacred commerce, and human purpose well lived. Matthew and Terces join me this week to talk about their amazing journey into the principle of gratitude and the love, peace, and empowered abundance that rise from it. Core to the experiential intelligence they share with the world is the principle of being – how we ‘be’ is everything. It determines how far-reaching, beautifully ‘foolish’, and creative our contributions to the processes of life are. It determines whether we live in abundance or scarcity, in loving community or in isolation. But as a colleague of mine says, ‘How do we do all this ‘being’ stuff?’ Matthew and Terces can actually answer that question! From their profound 4 Insights to their daily practices for ‘becoming’ they guide us into the world we are seeking. Tune in!</description>

      <description>If you’re seeking clarity – and aren’t we all – tune in this week when Mike Consol, communications expert, joins us for some clear talk on language – how we use it, how we misuse it, and how we can put words to work on our behalf. Language, a uniquely human talent, is a bit puzzling in that a portion of the brain has to slow down by orders of magnitude just so we can use words. It’s stressful to slow down in a fast-paced world, and one of the least understood outcomes of stress is that it cuts off our direct experience of the world – it cuts us off from the very sensory data that we use to create and encode meaning in words – collective meaning that can be clearly understood by others without individual assumptions distorting the communication or disrupting the connection. When language is well-crafted it brings us into the ‘now’ and opens us to possibility. It creates space-time for us to experience one another more deeply, and inspires us to participate in conscious living. Join us!</description>

      <title>Prescription for the World: Your Transformative Sensing Intelligence</title>
      <description>Joining me this week is Emmy Award winning composer and producer Gary Malkin, master of the emerging genre of Transformational Media – unique combinations of music, imagery, and spoken wisdom calibrated to open sensing awareness. This is precisely the same as opening relational awareness, the key to coming alive and living well. Last week we spoke about ‘thinking big’ and found out that it really means ‘sensing big’, but if you’re living in the stress lane, your sensory intelligence is actually off-line. Without a full bandwidth of sensory awareness the human psyche contracts; we become fearful, ill, and we fight against the world, losing touch with the vast experiential wisdom we carry. The only cure is direct sensing itself! Through the art of transformational media Gary has developed astonishing tools for healing, initiating, and maturing our sensory intelligence. With this maturation we regain our multi-dimensional connection to ourselves, to one another, and the world. Tune in!</description>

      <title>‘If you’re gonna be thinking, you might as well be thinking big.’</title>
      <description>The title of this week’s show is usually attributed to Donald Trump, and frankly, I think we all ought to try it on for size. People are gradually realizing that ‘thinking big’ is now required. Our plans and interactions, as participants in life on earth, need to be longer term, broader in scope, and infused with vision and global relevance. Yet we’re constantly caught up in narrowly defined, short-term neediness [if not outright panic], which shifts our values to the short term – and what we value we choose! Short-term solutions have a short life span; they lack the kind of energy and momentum that naturally weave into a developing future the way ‘big thinking’ does. So how do we ‘think big’? We take a leap beyond the world of tangible things and logical action, and we land, wide awake, in relational awareness where it is our nature to think big, solely in support of thriving. Tune in to find out what thinking really is, why context matters, and how to create value by thinking big!</description>

      <title>Empowering the World through Global Exchange</title>
      <description>Dr. Kevin Danaher, co-founder of Global Exchange and the Green Festivals, joins us this week for an uplifting discussion of the innovative, empowering exchanges his organization is spearheading – exchanges that are reshaping how we relate to one another, the planet, and the collective, interconnected nature of doing business in the world today. Global Exchange is on a mission to promote human rights and social, economic, and environmental justice around the world. This is a mission statement that shouts out the full intent of consciousness itself, and Kevin’s organization offers everyone an opportunity to participate fully in the awakening. From Fair Trade practices to political insight to alternative energy policies, Global Exchange offers the world a framework based on value, respect, and just exchange, and is proving on a daily basis that we can indeed awaken values that create not only profit, but well-being for all. Tune in and learn how you can participate in global exchange!</description>

      <title>The Laws of Money</title>
      <description>Courtney Smith returns to Awakening Value™ this week for an exciting talk about the Laws of Money! Money is actually an outcome, which means there is a process involved in creating that outcome. Specifically, money is a result of the value we put out in the world, so it matters how we create value and what actions we take. It matters that we are awake to our own value, and it matters how we relate, not just to one another, but to money itself. Just as we know there are organizing principles of consciousness, there are organizing principles, or laws, of money. These principles describe not only the nature of money, but how it’s accumulated and distributed. The laws of money tell us how to attract it, keep it, and manage it flawlessly for our own benefit and for the benefit of the world. The truth is that money is our exchange medium. Without a currency of exchange we simply cannot thrive. Tune in for Courtney’s amazing wisdom and learn how to achieve peace of mind through wealth!</description>

      <title>Sharing Our Way to Success</title>
      <description>Neal Gorenflo of Shareable.Net joins me this week for a vital look at sharing, an abundance-producing action that lies at the core of collective technology. It sounds simple enough, but as a society we don’t do much sharing. Have you noticed that when the going gets rough we’ve learned to pull away from one another? We’ve replaced sharing – a basic, inclusive principle of exchange and growth – with exclusive notions of competition and status quo. Instead of leaping at opportunities for multiple levels of abundance, we stop. We generate more scarcity. This is what happens in isolated linear awareness – the natural reach of our talents and knowledge pulls in because we’ve lost our full bandwidth of vision. We need relational awareness to see new pathways. Tune in for Neal’s extraordinary insights, examples, and instructions on rebuilding our world through pathways of sharing. He’s a master of the technology of collective action, and he’s teaching the world how to unite for success.</description>

      <title>Fueling Abundant Life</title>
      <description>Rinaldo Brutoco, President of the World Business Academy, joins me this week for a fierce look at the future we’re blindly creating as we cling to short-term, control-based ideas of what’s good for us. In ‘Freedom from Mid-East Oil’, Rinaldo and his co-authors expose the mistakes we’re making in fueling our lives, and define the choices we must make to save our lives and the resources our planet provides. The linear mind alone cannot perceive these choices, so they remain impossible. On Awakening Value™ we’re learning to live in relational awareness where such choices are not only possible, they are perceived as the obvious thing to do now! Rinaldo’s call to action is an exquisite example of an indigenous technique called ‘working upstream’ – using vision to see what is ‘becoming’, determine degrees of probability, and take focused action to manifest only beneficial long-term outcomes. This kind of mastery values the collective; its choice is life, not impending disaster. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Our Earth, Our Ocean, Our Future</title>
      <description>Join me this week for another amazing discussion with John Racanelli, Executive Advisor to Dr. Sylvia Earle’s Deep Search Foundation. With the gulf oil spill already disappearing from the headlines, and no significant change in long-term ocean policy in sight, it’s time we realized that without a healthy ocean there will be no life on the planet. We ought to appreciate the gravity of this statement simply because something has to wake us up, and if this truth doesn’t do it, we are indeed deeply asleep. In the Awakening Value™ dialogue, one of the primary points is this: the parts and the whole are inextricable. We simply cannot work toward individual success, or even business success, without also tending to planetary success, and the oceans are the bottom line. Shamanic technologies of consciousness are the key to unlocking a uniquely human drive that, by it’s nature, creates unlimited success through stewarding the planet and its resources. This is our future! Learn more! Tune in!</description>

      <description>Malidoma Patrice Somé, internationally honored Dagara elder and teacher, joins me this week for THE discussion about technology. We’ve reached a point in our evolution as a species where we’re faced with an extraordinary choice – to lead the next wave of evolutionary growth . . . or not. The cresting edge of this wave lies at the frontiers of consciousness. Yet we’re so fixated on our idea of physical technology as the only vehicle for advancement, we’ve blinded ourselves to the very source of all that ‘machinery’ – constantly evolving consciousness! Our physical technology is no longer solving our problems. Our ideas are not keeping pace with our challenges. Learning to ‘wake up’, to participate in the evolution of consciousness, puts us in the stream of an energy technology that delivers elegant, efficient ways to produce more abundance and success than we’ve managed or dreamt to date, ways that are at the same time loving, compassionate, and inclusive. No one gets left out. Join us</description>

      <title>The Intangibles!</title>
      <description>This week learn the secret of increasing your company’s value! For a modern business, the greater portion of its value lies in intangible assets. Historically, software, patents, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property were the recognized ‘intangibles’. Now we know that other intangibles – people and their talents, corporate culture and its style of relationships, and qualities such as passion and dedication – are definitively adding value to a company’s vision, mission, and service, and profit to the bottom line. In spite of new data proving such statements, it can seem dauntingly subjective to consider strategic approaches to intangible assets. How do you measure passion, or put it on your books? How do you know how much more you’ll make by stewarding a caring corporate culture? The priceless truth about the organizing principles is that they give us a ‘science’ for intangibles – a precise way to establish and grow these assets to new heights of value, profit, and success</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: Reclaiming Our Adaptive Genius</title>
      <description>The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.’ Let this powerful observation from Albert Einstein reverberate through your imagination. What if the sacred gift, our adaptive genius, regained primacy and became our source of awareness again? What if we reclaimed our ability to be in direct relationship with our environment and could heat-seek sources of value to create unerring success? Our environments have changed radically through the millennia – we are no longer people of the forests and the rivers, but of the internet’s landscapes. Yet the skills and potential we’ve developed over the ages of human evolution are still with us, waiting to be tapped in the modern world. Last week we spoke about using these skills to thrive in the financial world. This week we’ll investigate the potential of our adaptive genius to create abundance in a diverse global community. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Evolutionary change – it’s all in the process!</title>
      <description>Jeff Barnum, founder of Reos Partners, joins me this week to discuss one of the Big Challenges confronting us today – reclaiming the art of process. We clearly have an amazing capacity to imagine and make things, and that’s just what we do – we focus our attention and give value to things, the end-product. The process of creating things is perceived as secondary. It’s a distinctly linear view of the world, one path to get from A to B, ASAP. If you’re paying attention, you already see that we’re not creating change. Another widget isn’t going to rebuild an environment or eliminate hunger. It’s time we turned our attention to systems as a whole. Systems that truly generate value – societies, environments, businesses – are living entities that are constantly growing and changing. Our first task in crafting a success-filled future is learning to craft the processes of change that nourish and evolve systems to their highest levels. This is the revolutionary work of Reos Partners. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Getting Something Done!</title>
      <description>Deborah Nelson, Executive Director of Social Venture Network, joins me this week for an honest look at what it takes to get things done, not just to get through the checklist, but specifically to awaken value and enhance societal well-being! We talk about vision, passion, and the role of business in adding value to society – and make no mistake, we’re talking about available power and genius! Yet when it comes to actualizing this power, bringing the genius of vision into action, we tend to lose our way. At Social Venture Network a growing group of visionary entrepreneurs is using the organizing principles of consciousness, bringing the technologies of the collective, wholeness, and highly focused intent to catalyze extraordinary change in the way we do business. Remember two truths: [1] consciousness is always rising, reaching for innovation, success, and higher levels of well-being, and [2] business is now our primary path to consciousness. This is Awakening Value in action. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Sacred Commerce: Coming Full Circle</title>
      <description>Ayman Sawaf, internationally renowned visionary entrepreneur and co-author of Executive EQ, joins me this week for a revealing look at business as a path to full consciousness. Consider the foundational tenet of the Awakening Value™ dialogues: fully engaging the organizing principles of consciousness produces self-evolving abundance and success. Isn’t this what you strive to create in your business? We’ve always known that full consciousness is a sacred state of being. This knowledge is recorded in all the great traditions, yet somewhere along the line we separated the state itself from its active purpose: to generate on-going, evolutionary states of well-being, abundance, and successful growth for all life on the planet. If you consider that your business is a center for the creation and distribution of value and benefit to your stakeholders, you have to know consciousness is the source. Come full circle with us as we reweave the source and the outcome once again as sacred commerce.</description>

      <description>Craig Neal, co-founder of Heartland Circle and author of The Art of Convening: Authentic Engagements in Meetings, Gatherings, and Conversations, joins me this week for a vital discussion of the power and inevitability of collective engagement. Coming together as collectives, awakening our collective consciousness and intelligence – these are among our greatest challenges in reclaiming our ability to thrive. After all, if we manage to wake up in full consciousness, we are waking up in collective consciousness! Any insistence on then proceeding individually, or with ownership of our ideas instead of membership in the greater community, will simply collapse our state of awareness to the limits of linear processes, and we’ll be back where we started. Here’s the amazing thing about consciousness – in ‘waking up’ you find all the resources you need for success. Craig is our expert on gathering those resources by convening with your collective. Tune in for a truly valuable conversation!</description>

      <title>INTENT: the ‘How’ in ‘How do I do that?’</title>
      <description>Do you want to know how to get things done? This week I’ll share with you the secret ‘tool’ shamans have always used to get things done – intent! You need intent to do anything truly powerful in life. You need it to blossom yourself and craft a healed state for your body-mind; you need it to create a great business! In the technologies of consciousness, intent is not an abstract concept, nor is it the least bit subject to your inner critic, or to doubt or opinion. Intent is a tool, a primary organizing principle. In western culture we’re always asking, ‘How do I do that?’ We want the instruction book first, and then we’ll think about giving things a try. This leaves us at the mercy of whoever we turn to for those instructions. It leaves us lacking direct relationship with our own creative genius. Intent will plug you back in to your own best resource, your unique skills and vision. And intent will open you to the collective level of consciousness, which is where things really get done</description>

      <description>This week Francis Cholle – world-renowned advisor to Fortune 100 CEOs and one of the most creative minds in business – joins me for a deep discussion of our most valuable human asset and the role it can play in launching your business from the ordinary into the extraordinary. This asset is an aspect of human awareness, and we have lots of names for it. We call it intuition, instinct, relational intelligence, or luminous awareness if you’re a shaman. These terms all refer to the same capacity – to know and create in relational awareness – which has always allowed us to achieve far beyond the limits of logic and linear approaches. If you think you just need to ‘gear up’, get things back under control, or simply analyze the plan again, Francis has wonderful, surprising advice for you on how to reinvent your business model, boost innovation, and accelerate profitable change in your company. He is truly a master of the organizing principles of consciousness. Don’t miss this dialogue!</description>

      <title>This Thing Called Reciprocity</title>
      <description>This week 2 experts from the world of non-profits, Suzanne Irwin-Wells and Jerry Dahlke, join me for a unique look at this thing we call reciprocity in one of its most powerful modern expressions, philanthropy. Reciprocity is an organizing principle of consciousness. The Quechua word is ayni, and it means more than equal give and take. It’s an active process of sharing and exchange designed to produce collective abundance. Ayni is required for creation, well-being, and the evolution of consciousness itself. The exercising of ayni is our ultimate job. In today’s world wealth has become highly concentrated in certain areas and populations, often at the expense of others. At the same time, we see extraordinary calls to action, such as that made recently by Warren Buffet and Bill Gates, asking for that concentrated wealth to be distributed. Are we seeing an old idea of philanthropy or a new expression of consciousness, awakening to the principles of ayni and new possibility for our future</description>

      <title>Reclaiming Our Adaptive Genius</title>
      <description>The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.’ Let this powerful observation from Albert Einstein reverberate through your imagination. What if the sacred gift, our adaptive genius, regained primacy and became our source of awareness again? What if we reclaimed our ability to be in direct relationship with our environment and could heat-seek sources of value to create unerring success? Our environments have changed radically through the millennia – we are no longer people of the forests and the rivers, but of the internet’s landscapes. Yet the skills and potential we’ve developed over the ages of human evolution are still with us, waiting to be tapped in the modern world. Last week we spoke about using these skills to thrive in the financial world. This week we’ll investigate the potential of our adaptive genius to create abundance in a diverse global community. Tune in!</description>

      <title>Reality Check!</title>
      <description>This week Courtney Smith, Founder of the Investment Mentoring Institute, returns to Awakening Value™ for a marvelous reality check. Are you focused on how bad things are?  Our discussion may surprise you! We’re clearly in a time of great flux and uncertainty – value is suddenly elusive, the old rules are failing us, and our old habit is to pull in, stay small, and look to the past. We ask, ‘Why isn’t it like it used to be? When will it be that way again?’ The truth is that times of great fluctuation and change are times of great opportunity – to create what is more resilient, adaptive, and profitable. These are times to place your focus on what is working now, on what is generating value and profit. These are times to value underlying principles – they are always the ultimate source of new solutions. Even if you’ve never traded so much as one share of stock, the principles we’ll discuss offer powerful insights for everyone’s success. Join us for one of our most important dialogues yet</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: Outcomes of Value</title>
      <description>Courtney Smith, founder of the Investment Mentoring Institute, joins me this week for a spirited discussion of money, values, and the creation of abundance in modern culture. Money is a vital topic – we earn it, lose it, hoard it, need it, but what is it? If you ask Courtney he’s likely to tell you that money is energy. It obeys the laws of energy. It’s the outcome when you learn to see, create, and invest in value. Ask a shaman and he’ll say money is Spirit’s gift to us, to use as our modern exchange medium. Lacking a barter economy, something has to change hands when we sell our services, or purchase someone else’s goods. That ‘something’ in our day and age is money. This is simply an expression of the law of complementarities, one of the organizing principles that fuels creation, growth, and fluid abundance. This suggests that money and consciousness are inextricably linked, and our success with money rises in direct proportion to our state of awakened value. Tune in to learn more!</description>

      <title>Dharma: The True Measure of Awakening</title>
      <description>Jeff Marcous, 2010 Green Business Leader of the Year and President of Dharma Merchant Services, joins me this week for a powerful investigation of what it means to be awake in the world of business. If business is, as we proposed last week, a source point for the creation, exchange, and delivery of value, how does being ‘awake’ help us create a successful business? What’s love got to do with it? Do we ‘dis’ respect in the name of competition? Can one business owner or corporate team member really make a difference? If you’re awake in business, you’re in love – with process, relationship, and the creation of value for the betterment of everyone. Being ‘awake’ means experiencing, relating, innovating, and taking action for the express purpose of generating value and collective abundance. It means allowing compassion and respect to craft your pathways to success. Join us to discover how great a difference you can make, and how much you can benefit, by coming fully awake in work and life.</description>

      <title>My Complex Adaptive What?</title>
      <description>Do you ever feel ‘talked at’ rather than directly included when you hear phrases such as ‘psychosocial infrastructure’ or ‘complex adaptive system’? I hope your answer is yes! Especially in business, we still tend to value using dry, impersonal language that squeezes the light and passion right out of our inspired ideas. There are many insights rising in today’s world – insights into leadership, the character of successful organizations, innovation, value, and profit. The most exciting of these are shining a bright light on the true value of people and the limitless power of human imagination. This in turn is giving rise to new models of leadership, distributed within an organization to steward creativity into action, producing products and services unparalleled in quality and value. This week we’ll investigate a surprising new trio of organizing principles that take us to the heart of collective technologies, empowered leadership, and success. Tune in, call in, join the dialogue!</description>

      <title>Stewarding Leadership for Collective Success</title>
      <description>Join me this week in conversation with Elizabeth Becker, Principle of Becker &amp; Company Consulting, and Executive Director of the Professional Business Women of California [PBWC]. Following our discussion of collective technology last week, Elizabeth and I will explore the role of leadership in successful collective action, from the challenges of stewardship and the intangibles that inspire and weave collectives, to the tangible value that can be crafted as the outcome of a collective’s shared journey. It is vital to remember as we explore the technology of collectives that they are multidimensional, and the inner workings are everything. A great collective does not result from one point of leadership. It emerges when intelligent leadership is distributed deeply through an organization, delivering inspiration, education, and connection in ways that resonate with, and steward, the uniquely skilled individuals who comprise the whole. Elizabeth Becker is our expert this week – tune in!</description>

      <title>Invaluable Technology: The Conscious Collective</title>
      <description>‘We have no choice but to allow ourselves to be reclaimed by the collective.’ This astonishing statement from a Q’ero elder is at the core of our dialogue this week as we reconsider our beliefs about collectives – how they function and the role of individuals who comprise them. We’ll take a look at how the nature of business collectives is changing today, yet we’ll have to reach for the stars to understand this elder’s teaching. We have no choice because the ultimate collective is consciousness itself, and it is rising. Great human collectives are successful in the same way consciousness is successful – always exercising experiential intelligence to create multi-level interconnectivities, which in turn are used to fuel and manifest innovative benefit at all levels within the system, for all parts of the system. Only something with a heart and soul can exercise this kind of intelligence for its own evolution and success. Join me in this discussion of the vital technology of collectives</description>

      <description>Jason Brody, M.S. joins us for a conversation about awakening the most valuable asset you have – your own magnificence. It blossoms as you discover emotional intelligence and authenticity, and Jason’s expertise is uniquely valuable on this great journey. Emotional well-being is vital to success. This applies to everyone and every collective, from families to corporations. Our unique human consciousness, including emotions and their power to influence perception and action, can allow or disallow our living life to its fullest. We are genetically coded to thrive, yet thriving is often blocked by a learned identity given to us by others. The regaining of our authentic self and thrive-ability lies on the path to emotional maturity and release of old identities. We never travel this path alone; it often looks too daunting to step onto, even with company. Jason offers us an amazing methodology, one that can lead you to graceful awakening to a full life with your most valuable asset – you!</description>

      <description>Don’t just tune in this week – call in! Master consultant Richard Whiteley returns for a down-to-earth discussion of the practical applications of shamanic techniques and technologies in business – and we want to talk to you! We’ll discuss our own real-world examples of shamanism in action and we want to hear your questions and experiences. Every great solution to a problem, or response to a challenge, rises from the organizing principles of consciousness at work. Shamanic techniques are the tools that put these principles to work for you. The best way to master them is through real-life example, a bit of mentoring, and direct experience in your own business. Shamanism exists for the most practical of reasons, to create and support conscious, abundant, thriving life. Shamanic approaches are incredibly efficient, saving time, money, and energy as they awaken the limitless power of Spirit in organizations and generate creative momentum that carries you and your company to great success.</description>

      <description>Hank Wesselman, PhD, joins me this week for an eye-opening conversation about shamanic technologies, the value of human experience, and our extraordinary, innate capacity for direct revelation and evolution. The Yaqui masters say that shamanism is a state of consciousness – one in which we discover and actualize everything we require to thrive and evolve. Recent discoveries in neurobiology confirm that every human has the capacity to attain and benefit from this state of awareness, yet we keep losing our link to its value. Where we don’t perceive value, we diminish, deny, or simply don’t perceive at all. We end up believing that matter is separate from energy, humans are separate from Spirit, and only logic, not imagination, can express truth. This leaves us sitting in a rather diminished state, where meaning is lost and possibility recedes from view. Join us as we shine a larger light on traditional knowledge to reveal its true meaning and value for you in crafting a successful life.</description>

      <description>Join me this week in conversation with Julie Motz, ‘radical healer’, as we talk about achieving healed states and emotional freedom. Shamans in all cultures know that the capacity to craft a good life and be part of a healthy community can only arise in healed states. They place high value on processes that clear harmful energies, whether emotional or physical, from the body, mind, and soul of their people. In the modern world we have lost many of these sophisticated techniques and instead live with a great deal of trauma. This not only creates illness. It starves the soul of the culture, diminishes our creative capacity, and cuts our ability to form healthy, productive relationships at all levels. In short, we are incapable of achieving lasting success without valuing proper care of the human energy field. Julie Motz is our expert as we explore the modern human experience, individually and collectively, and investigate how we can turn the tide to create healed states for everyone.</description>

      <title>The Secret of the Golden Tree</title>
      <description>Imagine you dreamt about a magical thing – a Golden Tree – that could solve all your problems. What would you risk to find it? What would you give up or deny in order to claim it? This week we’ll turn to your highest powers, your creative imagination and relational intelligence, to engage the process of finding the Golden Tree and master the challenges of desire and power it brings us. I’ll tell you a great story about denial and acceptance, misperceptions of value and truth, and the loss and reclamation of power and happiness. Using the organizing principles of consciousness we’ll take a look at the collective state of denial we find ourselves in today, blind to the challenges and losses we face economically, environmentally, and socially. It’s a denial that directly threatens our well-being. It leaves us valuing what is ultimately harmful and ignoring what is priceless. Tune in to learn about perceptual errors, becoming a person of power, and mastering the awakening of value.</description>

      <title>Turning the Tables</title>
      <description>This Thursday is April Fool’s Day, and as good court jesters will do, we will be ‘turning the tables’. I will be the guest and Jerry Dahlke, Sponsorship and Communications Director for Awakening Value™, will take the lead as interviewer in finding out how a shaman’s mind really works. It’s all well and good for me to talk to you about shamanic technology, but how do I use it? What goes on in my shaman’s awareness? How do shamans awaken and steward value? It’s important in ‘becoming’ a shaman to develop a full range of skills and attributes, from the keenest vision and technical acumen, to a quality the shamans call being ‘personable’ [as opposed to ‘personal’]. Jerry and I will probe the depths, inquiring into the finer points of the shaman’s awareness and modes of action, the values we hold dear, and the views we have of past, present, and future possibility. Tune in for a very special, and we hope enlightening, conversation on the awakening of value.</description>

      <title>Portals to Truth and Value</title>
      <description>This week Itzhak Beery, publisher of shamanportal.org, joins me in an enlightening discussion of shamanic practice and its role in our changing world. In business we know that our personal preferences are not the key to success; even our best ideas, according to Keith Cunningham, generate a mere 1% of the profit we seek. For the other 99%, it’s the creation of what is valuable to our customers, and the spirit in which we create and deliver value, that makes the difference. This means we are constantly concerned with perception, connection, communication, and truth. It requires a flexibility that allows us to consistently and dependably change and grow with our customers’ changing needs. Shamanic training develops precisely these skills; it presents us a technology that can be used anywhere to create value. In the Yaqui tradition, the masters say that ‘the crux of shamanism is to change our idea of the world’. Tune in! Learn about the portals to this wisdom and how you can participate.</description>

      <description>Join me this week in conversation with Richard Whiteley – world-renowned speaker, writer, and author of The Corporate Shaman – as we use our relational intelligence to understand the intricate world of power that we call ‘business’. Make no mistake – if you’re in business, you’re in the business of power in all its forms, from leadership and management responsibilities, to interpersonal relations, the flow of resources and funds, and inter-professional networks. Through a Western lens it can seem quite the jungle – unpredictable, confusing, and often moving against you. However, through the shaman’s lens, a whole new world emerges, one that is full of collective wisdom and potential. We can experience energies on the move, manifesting realities, and we learn the language of power that constantly informs, reveals, and guides us in the most beneficial ways of being, relating, and taking action. Tune in to learn how you can awaken your inner shaman and discover new pathways to success.</description>

      <title>Oceans of Value</title>
      <description>Tune in this week for an awe-inspiring talk with John Racanelli, Executive Advisor to Dr. Sylvia Earle’s Deep Search Foundation, whose mission is to explore and care for the ocean. In indigenous cultures the ocean is the great teacher of fluidity, and the conversation between the ocean waters and the massive geography that contains them is the source of incredible knowledge about the complementarities of fluidity and structure. In modern cultures the ocean is our metaphor for the ‘subconscious’, which we’re discovering in our weekly dialogues is actually our very awake, very deep, relational mind – the center of our perceptual and creative capacity. To crack this capacity open and thrive into our future we need to get to know it and steward it, just as we must know and care for the oceans. Join us and learn from Grandmother Ocean, magnificent teacher of the real laws of abundance – interconnectivities, positive adaptation, and the continual creation of what is required for thriving.</description>

      <title>The Radical Truth of Sufficiency</title>
      <description>Join me this week in conversation with Carol Dearborn, President of The Sufficiency Foundation, for an eye-opening discussion of value, truth, and the creation of sufficient abundance. There are many radical truths we face in the world today. One of these truths is this: the organizing principles of consciousness, when embodied collectively, automatically give rise to abundance throughout the collective. This abundance is not just monetary, nor is it only for individuals. It includes, by its nature, all of the necessities that sustain and grow families, communities, environments, and the global collective. A primary outcome is that draining dependencies and excesses are replaced with vital, life-enhancing interconnectivities that are as elegantly sufficient as anything in the cosmos. Another truth is this: joy, freedom, and creativity are naturally generated in a system that provides sufficiency for its living parts. Sufficiency is truly an act of consciousness.

      <description>Join me this week in conversation with David Hodgson – co-founder of the IdeaHive, member of the International Futures Forum, and true catalyst for bridging knowledge into viable action. David will talk to us about the power of the Three Horizons, the World Model, and the meaning of true viability as we investigate ways to leverage the collective genius of humankind into meaningful action for today and the future. We know we face global challenges and are being asked to change our ways of life and business. There is actually no shortage of wisdom when it comes to talking about these issues. There is, however, a lack of correspondingly focused, intelligent action, the kind our inner genius would leap at. How do we bridge the gap? By engaging a new concept of collective structure and fluidity – one that is multidimensional and reveals possibility and the fluid results of interactions. Tune in for a new view of the global collective and how you can play a parting leveraging our genius!</description>

      <description>James Balog, nature photojournalist, founder of the Extreme Ice Survey, and visionary for our time, joins us this week for a vital discussion of perception, change, and meaningful action. Since 2007, the Extreme Ice Survey team has been documenting the melting of Earth’s glaciers and ice caps, creating a real-time visual record of global warming from a revolutionary vantage point. Like the physicists who scaled the energy waves of a black hole down to the range of human hearing to discover this giant of outer space singing the note b-flat, James Balog has scaled the immensely long ‘wavelengths’ of change in the ice caps down to the frequency range of human vision so we can perceive – become aware of through the senses – what is actually occurring in our time. James says we have the technology, the people, and the money we need; but we lack the perception we need to take right action. James Balog’s gift to us is the opening of that larger perception. Tune in for a stunning conversation</description>

      <description>Join me this week as we talk with Sophis Dorsainvil, Haitian songwriter and lead singer for the well-known band, Kalbass Kreyol. With the disastrous effects of the earthquake in Haiti capturing the world’s attention, Sophis brings us his unique cross-cultural views of our global response to this devastating event and the opportunities it presents us. We have a chance right now to consider the very nature of our connectivity to one another, and to evolve it. We have the chance to consider the frameworks [infrastructures] we use to build communities and support cultures, and to evolve them. It all depends on our capacity to perceive and act collectively, not personally. This leads us to significant inquiries into the nature of collective action, belonging and grief, and Nature’s requirement that if we give, we must receive. If we can receive in awareness what we’re learning, what can we craft from this great conversation in Haiti between the powerful forces of earth and humankind?</description>

      <description>Join me this week in conversation with Kirby Seid, founder of the Light Labyrinth Project, an in-depth study of the interactions between crystalline structures, light, sound, and consciousness. We’ll continue the discussion of perception – what it is, how we recognize it, how we do it, and how we benefit from the absolute magic that results when we perceive in awareness! Reaching higher levels of consciousness can seem beyond us, but as you experience the wonder of your human capacity to know and to create, you’ll realize higher consciousness is your gift! The truth is that the world as it is holds everything we need to craft a magical, abundant future. To access all of this, we must first, actively sense and connect with the world around us, and second, become conscious of the other half of the equation – structure! The fluidity of perception requires a framework for meaning to be produced and creative actions to manifest in useful forms. Tune in for some powerful new information!</description>

      <description>The Yaqui masters tell us that the core of our being as humans is the act of perceiving, and the magic of our being is the act of awareness. Notice that awareness is active – this is a participatory universe! How many people do you know who have suffered a setback because they didn’t know the next action to take? Success is all about perception – action rises from perceiving. Yet the Yaqui masters have a caution for us. They also remind us that, generally speaking, we are taught what to perceive. If we learn how perception works, and what it looks like in the ordinary world of business, finance, and human relations then we can make a new start. We realize that simply fixing the old ills is not the next best action. Join me this week as we take a look at how we learn what to perceive – what to be aware of – and how this affects the way we go about business, governance, relationship work, and most importantly, the act of creating new solutions and the revitalized world we are seeking.</description>

      <description>Join me this week in conversation with Randall Fontes as he shines the light of consciousness on the secrets of the great human journey. Randall has devoted over 4 decades to research in the fields of consciousness and the interactions of energies – sound and light – with form, in his quest to create an accessible path to full awareness for everyone. Biologically, humans are wired to create, thrive, and awaken, but consider how seriously these attributes are restricted in this day and age. We put so much effort into beating our competition to the next niche that we lose touch with the vastness of the wisdom within us, and its relationship to the powers of the world around us. In order to realize our astounding potential we must re-craft an experiential union of body, mind, and spirit that wakes us up and bridges our creative power out into the world. This is the core of Randall Fontes’ work. Tune in for amazing information and insights on how you can awaken and unfold your potential.</description>

      <title>Harvesting the Power of Completions</title>
      <description>The year’s end is a time when we reflect on what has been and make promises for what is to come, yet most of us are unaware that there is a way to empower our thoughts and turn them into active engagements in the world. All that’s required is that we actually complete what needs completing! One of the most surprising powers in the technologies of consciousness is the wisdom of cycles of action – gathering insight for innovation, taking action to the fullest expression, and bringing action to its most beneficial completion. In nature you would be hard pressed to find anything that doesn’t live by this technology. In business you’ll find the most successful people doing the same thing. Peter Drucker’s mastery of ‘systematic innovation’ and ‘systematic abandonment’ are examples. Unaware of the requirement for full completions, we end up dragging old energies with us that make each successive attempt to act harder. Instead of breaking a cycle, learn how to complete one! Tune in this week!</description>

      <title>Your Most Valuable Holiday Exercise: Gratitude!</title>
      <description>The shamans say that in order to live and relate well, our very beingness must rise from a place of beauty, power, and radiance. With all the depressing news that surrounds us in the media, it may be hard to remember that we still have access to anything like beauty, power, or radiance. Yet at the heart of shamanic technologies of consciousness and success lies a powerful tool that not only connects us with the beauty and grace we long for, but grows our capacity to call in what we dream of – individually and collectively. This simple tool is the exercising of gratitude – and it is truly an exercise that pays you back 10-fold and more. Of course, we’re not talking about voicing platitudes. We’re talking about an extraordinary technology of creative communication and exchange that has the potential to stream into your life what you require to thrive, and gift you the miracle of membership in the collective of all living things. Tune in this week and learn how to exercise gratitude!</description>

      <title>Recognizing the Great Awakening</title>
      <description>Join me this week for a powerful conversation with Paul Hawken, noted author and environmentalist, as we discuss the great awakening that is occurring in the world today. This is the transition we seek. It is the awakening of collective consciousness, delivering to us excellent solutions for a sustainable green economy and a better future. We recognize some of the solutions, and argue whether to implement them, but as long as we persist in our current habit of linear awareness, we can only perceive isolated ideas, the end-products of consciousness, not the dynamic intelligence itself that is rising in the ‘now’. Not only are we in danger of mistaking the isolated solutions for a ‘whole’ and stopping before we arrive, but we are also left with only the past as a reference. We have no view of the future in linear awareness. However, when we learn to recognize what is actually rising, how it is interconnected, and how we can participate, the whole world changes. Tune in! Participate!</description>

      <description>Join me this week for a powerful discussion with film director and visionary Joel Christian McEwen, whose latest film, WalkingThroughWorlds, shines an extraordinary light on the value of human experiential wisdom, in particular the vast amount of knowledge held in indigenous cultures about how to create healed states for the individual and the collective. To quote Joel, ‘What if the path to our survival is not to be found through the evolution of new technology but through evolving ourselves to be more in tune with the already existing ancient knowledge of the planet and our ancestors?’ When indigenous shamans speak of the power of healed states, they are speaking of yet another aspect of consciousness – an organizing principle that establishes sustainable equilibriums of health, well-being, and evolutionary growth for society at all levels, for the environment, the economies of the world, and the future of all life on the planet. Tune in for this eye-opening dialogue!</description>

      <title>Perceiving the Dimensions of Value</title>
      <description>Value is something we perceive, and we know through our dialogues so far that perception is a sensory event. The Dagara elders remind us that we’re given a multitude of physical senses because we’re intended to experience our world in multiple ways at once, to know life through many dimensions. Imagine creating a service or product whose value is directly experienced through many dimensions. ‘The Ultimate Formula For Success’ tells us to ‘find out what they want, go and get, and give it to them’; what we need to know is that these 3 phases are multidimensional and interrelated! Instead of traveling the linear maps of corporate process, assembly line production, and linear delivery to the marketplace, we can invent wholly new levels of creative success by learning to be aware through the dimensions of consciousness. The mastery of relational awareness opens levels of our perceptual capacity that reach beyond the confines of deadlines and milestones. Tune in Thursday to learn more!</description>

      <title>Special Encore Presentation: WHY NOT NOW?</title>
      <description>One of the most important organizing principles in shamanic technologies is  ‘pacha’ – a coordinate in the fabric of space-time, a ‘now’. It means the ‘present’ experienced as a unique moment of consciousness, beyond the limits of linear time and thought. We still place high value on the linear – if this, then that – yet when we engage pacha our consciousness is immediately organized as a great relational intelligence, sourcing from the whole of collective experience. In pacha we know the totality of life as a dialogue of creation, the parts and the whole in constant exchange. This is true awakening. It brings with it the direct knowledge of what has evolutionary value, and this is where our great conversation begins. We’ll use the technology itself to discover what in the world shamans, value, and business have in common. We’ll unveil the map of human consciousness and redefine its technology so you can begin to learn these powerful principles and become part of the evolution, now.</description>

      <title>The Value of Love and Gratitude</title>
      <description>This week our guest is Philena Bruce, a true maestra in the art of achieving a ‘loved state’ and benefiting from all the accompanying miracles. One of the core organizing principles of consciousness is the unconditional acceptance of what is so – the Quechua word is munay; the English word is love. It’s a perceptual state we achieve in the same instant we organize our awareness by the principle of ‘now’. You’ve all experienced this – it is an invaluable state of grace in which everything is truly all right and what you need appears. Unfortunately, we tend to hold our brief encounters with this grace at a distance – as a bit of a fairy tale – so we forget how easy it is to achieve in everyday life. Let’s learn to recognize this powerful technology as it arises in everyday life, to see how close at hand it is, so we can believe in its power and change our ways of living. Join me this week in a truly visionary conversation with Philena as we discuss her latest book, ‘Know You are Loved’.</description>

      <description>Join me this week in conversation with Isabel Maxwell as she reveals the secrets of ‘LLCC’ – her protocol for creating value-filled meaning and connections in businesses around the world. Isabel is an expert in using the organizing principles of consciousness to enrich relationships and communications across cultures. As president of Maxwell-Communications, she knows first-hand the results of one of the greatest losses we suffer being awake solely in a linear world – the loss of depth and clarity in our understanding of one another. Add to that the speed we now demand, especially in communications, and we have even less opportunity to understand one another or the complexities of our world, and less opportunity to create value that has meaning on a broader scale. The technologies of consciousness provide an entire matrix of organizing principles through which meaning is accurately perceived and connections flourish. Join us this week and learn to awaken valued meaning in your business</description>

      <description>This week we’ll be talking with Ross Evans – inventor, adventurer, humanitarian, and design catalyst. His amazing passion for discovery dissolves the limits of the known world and fully reveals what’s possible at the leading edge of creativity. His inventions have helped thousands of people, given birth to businesses, and inspired other creative geniuses. And he wants to inspire you too! Ross holds the vision of a world organized to receive and support creative ideas, right through the production phase. He is on a mission to help others find their own leading edge of passion and go to work there. Of course, the technologies show us that there is never just one edge – no cliff to fear. There are always complementarities meeting at an active interface where everything required for manifesting ideas will always show up. Ross has discovered this and many other truths about full consciousness. Don’t miss this important conversation with a master of creative multiplicity and awakened value.</description>

      <description>One of the best things you can do to be successful in business is to become an expert in your field – find out all the skills and knowledge you need and master them. Then keep learning! Successful business people know that we make good money working within our area of expertise because that’s where our experiential intelligence is strongest – that’s where we have knowledge and mastery. Working outside that expertise we lose money. The reason is simple: we lose because there are things we don’t know. As a member of the human species, you should know that the largest potential expertise you have lies right between your ears! It’s your capacity to be aware – of everything! It’s your sensing brain and its ability to know and create and evolve. To become a master of this capacity, all it takes is dedicated sensory play – no thinking allowed! This week learn more about how shamans play their way to mastery of conscious relational awareness. Tune in, bring your questions, and let’s play!</description>

      <title>THE VALUE OF ‘YES!’</title>
      <description>The technologies of consciousness bring ‘yes’ responses into being by expanding collective awareness and creating collective meaning. From this, the most beneficial, multi-faceted outcomes arise. In modern cultures, for all our efforts to change, we still tend to focus on what is wrong, proud of ourselves for looking a problem square in the face, yet unaware that the quality of our focus is producing ‘no’ responses everywhere. We end up unable to access the matrix of wisdom that gives rise to the new solutions we seek. Instead of saying ‘No, that won’t work’, we must master the technologies of ‘yes’. Discover how to perceive and say ‘Yes, this is worth the investment!’ Yes, that is beneficial to our collective!’ Yes, you are my complementary opposite, and coming together will create the vision and momentum we need to move forward!’ As Rumi says, ‘Say yes quickly if you know, if you‘ve known it from before the beginning of the universe.’ Tune in this week – awaken the value of ‘yes!’.</description>

      <description>This Thursday, we have the honor of speaking with Nick Hardigg, Executive Director of the Alaska Conservation Foundation. ACF is an extraordinary organization whose work is one of the most powerful and successful examples of the organizing principles of consciousness in action. From the principle of complementarities, to the inexorable link between thriving communities and harmonized opposites, to the technology of respectful relationships [yes, it’s a technology!] Nick Hardigg and the ACF team are creating models for local and global change that produce innovative, abundant outcomes. ACF’s leading-edge vision of the value of conservation is founded in the technologies of relationship and process. Focus is beamed on bringing meaning to the value of our resources, opening awareness of the individual’s value to the whole, and stewarding the resulting momentum into actions that benefit everyone and every collective. Join us this week ¬¬– organize your business processes to awaken value!</description>

      <description>This week I’m excited to introduce you to Lincoln Ascott, London filmmaker and accredited healer. Through Lincoln’s work in film, teaching his students to bring their own stories into conscious awareness, we’ll explore the power of imagery. This is the language consciousness, of relational intelligence, and even though we’ve lost much of our connection to it, the minute we’re exposed to great creativity at work our own capacity to sense, know, and share our experiential wisdom cracks wide open. Equally important is Lincoln’s work with land and related structures, healing harmful energies in the earth and in buildings so people and businesses may return to their full vitality. The indigenous technologies of consciousness include land as an organizing principle. Our full consciousness must incorporate the lands we come from and work with. Join me for the extraordinary insights and teachings Lincoln has to offer.</description>

      <description>It can be very hard to get new ideas off the ground these days. There is so much uncertainty when it comes to knowing the value of ideas or the stability of price-to-value relationships, and this uncertainty devours momentum. Yet every day we say that we need new solutions in action, and we need them now. At the same time, we often say we need all our ducks in a row before we launch our something new. The only time you’re likely to see ducks in a row in nature is after the new ducklings have been created and are paddling after their mom along the lake edge. So how in the world do you launch an idea, or add creative power to your current endeavor? How do you apply the technologies of consciousness and value to fuel your ideas and grow your business into the future? In this week’s discussion we’ll answer these questions as we investigate the technical state of ‘wholeness’ and its inherent nature to generate focused momentum. Tune in and bring your questions to the dialogue!</description>

      <description>This week on Awakening Value meet Anthony Sandberg, president and founder of OCSC, a remarkable sailing school located in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Much of Anthony’s expertise lies in corporate team building and leadership training. His unique approach involves taking leaders directly into the conversation between fluidity [wind and water] and structure [the sailboat]. This is a classic example of shamanic technologies in action where implicit learning – the skill of your relational awareness – comes to the fore and does its proper job – informing linear awareness of the best course of action moment to moment, actions literally spoken at the interface between variables in continual motion. As Anthony says, ‘Sailing is an excellent metaphor for business.’  Tune in and learn to apply these principles in your own business and arenas of expertise!</description>

      <description>This week on Awakening Value learn the secret of perception and imagination. Be introduced to your brain’s limitless capacity, and discover how it’s connected to the shaman’s technology of consciousness – a technology that produces value and abundance, visionary solutions, and momentum for evolution. Experience the source within you that already knows how to awaken value in all the ‘right’ places. 
Even though we’re remembering pieces of this knowledge, we’re still looking at our re-discovered wisdom through a lens that separates us from it. We need to shift to a different state of awareness in order to have direct access. It sounds great, but we usually end up asking, ‘but how do we get there’? You’ll find out this week! 
Here are some practices to help you make the shift: Release into the ‘now’ – feel the change. Find complementary opposites in conversation – see totally new ideas or forms rise in the interface. Notice beauty – no thinking or naming, just pure experience.</description>

      <title>WHY NOT NOW?</title>
      <description>One of the most important organizing principles in shamanic technologies is  ‘pacha’ – a coordinate in the fabric of space-time, a ‘now’. It means the ‘present’ experienced as a unique moment of consciousness, beyond the limits of linear time and thought. We still place high value on the linear – if this, then that – yet when we engage pacha our consciousness is immediately organized as a great relational intelligence, sourcing from the whole of collective experience. In pacha we know the totality of life as a dialogue of creation, the parts and the whole in constant exchange. This is true awakening. It brings with it the direct knowledge of what has evolutionary value, and this is where our great conversation begins. We’ll use the technology itself to discover what in the world shamans, value, and business have in common. We’ll unveil the map of human consciousness and redefine its technology so you can begin to learn these powerful principles and become part of the evolution, now.</description>
