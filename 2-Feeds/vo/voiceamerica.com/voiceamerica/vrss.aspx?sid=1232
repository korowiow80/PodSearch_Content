How old were you when you put that schematic together? It is time to take back control of your life. Tune in to Being Here and take off the pressure as you take off in your life.</description>

      <description>"Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend's success."  Oscar Wilde  Most of us have been trained in the win/lose approach to life where somebody else’s success is treated as our failure.  In this lighthearted episode Ariel &amp; Shya will present a fresh perspective where another’s success can inspire you into your own greatness.</description>

      <title>Memories: Fact or Fiction</title>
      <description>Join Ariel and Shya Kane in this intriguing episode as they investigate memories. A common misconception is that our memories accurately represent past events. But in fact they are simply recordings of those events made from a point of view of the person we were at that time.  If we hold our memories as the truth, let them define us, and allow them to filter the way we experience reality, we will surely be misguided. Listen in as The Kanes and callers from their live audience discuss Memories: Fact or Fiction.</description>

      <description>At this time in history we have the blessing of living longer than any of our ancestors. But to have an extended life span without an extended awareness of how to live life and enjoy the fullness of a lifetime’s harvest, isn’t really a blessing at all. Join Ariel and Shya Kane and their special guest Persephone Arbour, internationally acclaimed seminar leader, as they discuss some of the fears, dreams and myths about what it actually means to become ‘an older person.’ With over thirty years experience facilitating workshops and retreats, Persephone mainly, but not exclusively, works with people over the age of 50. Regardless of your age, this episode offers a valuable approach to discovering a less fearful and more relaxed attitude toward ageing and the future.</description>
