									<h3>Ty   Bollinger  </h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Ty  Bollinger  is  a  CPA,  health  freedom  advocate,  cancer  researcher,  former  competitive  bodybuilder,  and  author  of  the  best-selling  book  Cancer  –  Step  Outside  the  Box.  
 After  losing  several  family  members  to  cancer  (including  his  mother  and  father),  Ty  refused  to  accept  the  notion  that  chemotherapy,  radiation,  and  surgery  were  the  most  effective treatments available for cancer patients. He began  a  quest  to  learn  all  he  possibly   could  about  alternative  cancer  treatments  and  the  medical  industry.  What he  uncovered  was  shocking.  There  is  ample  evidence  to  support  the  allegation  that  the  “war  on  cancer”  is  largely  a  fraud  and  that  multinational  pharmaceutical  companies  are  “running the show.”  
  Most importantly, Ty Bollinger is a committed Christian, a devoted husband, and the father of three wonderful children. His website is www.CancerTruth.net.

									<h3>Dr. Bill  Code</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											At 42, Dr. Code was at the height of a successful and challenging career in Anesthesiology when a Neurologist diagnosed the symptoms that had plagued him for fifteen years as progressive Multiple Sclerosis, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the central nervous system, often resulting in severe pain and neurological deterioration.

It was not until 1997, while attending a conference entitled Complimentary & Alternative Medical Choices for Multiple Sclerosis that Dr. Code began to have hope.

Dr. Code began to investigate the integration of organic foods, vitamins supplements and other holistic wellness regimens to facilitate his healing process. It was his own progression over the next few months that drove Dr. Code’s passion in Integrative Medicine, an approach to medicine that encompasses both conventional treatments but also combines natural medicine paradigms.

As an acclaimed speaker and author, Dr. Code has authored numerous books. www.DrBillCode.com

									<h3>Debra  Corbo, BS, PT, CPT</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Debra Corbo, BS, PT, CPT. and Douglas Splittgerber, CPT. have combined their two knowledge bases and two entirely different paths of learning which has resulted in the understanding that they share about the human body and how we, as human beings, were designed to function. They have been honing their understanding of human function and developing the methods and techniques that make up The Alignment Resistance Training Method of stretching and strengthening.

In their 50’s they have no arthritis or back pain and they still have levels of strength and muscle that exceed most 20 year olds. They live what they teach people to do and put themselves up as extreme examples of what the human body can do despite serious complications. 

As they always say, "our body does not wear out from use, it wears out from abuse". The decision is up to each one of us about how we age and the quality of live we have.

									<h3>Dr. Nikki  Lang </h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Dr. Lang was born into this world destined to be a maverick. Although her parents couldn't afford to send her to college, she went anyway, paying her own way through Temple University. She married in her last year of college and gave birth to her first child, followed two years later by her second. Three years later when her marriage failed, she retained custody of her children and entered medical school as a single mother. When she finished her training, she started her own family practice in Center City Philadelphia in 1981.
She was named one of the best physicians in the United States by Ladies Home Journal, Town and Country, and Top Doctors.
Dr. Lang wrote her first book, A Novel Diet, as an extension of her desire to teach, and like the rest of her life, it was unconventional. Publishers told her, "We only publish fiction!" or "We only publish nonfiction!" "I wouldn't know how to market it!" said another publisher. Of course, that didn't stop her.

Unfortunately, many people are not aware of the natural approach that can put them on the road to lifelong health. Dr. Murray has dedicated his life to educating physicians, patients, and the general public on the tremendous healing power of nature.

									<h3>Alan  Smith</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Necessity really is the mother of invention.  

When the Mayo Clinic didn’t have a cure for my health problems I turned to complementary and alternative therapies. It was hard for me to believe that modern medical science didn’t have the answer to every problem, but I was living proof that mainstream medicine has limits.  

As a Baby Boomer I’m used to my generation changing America at every stage of our life so why should aging be any different?   I knew that the current medical situation needed to change too.  There had to be a way to solve my health problem and I was willing to try anything.  

More than two decades of weekly traveling and working in a dying industry had taken a toll on my health but slowly it began to improve along with my outlook on life.  As each day got a little better I wanted to share my discoveries about all of the wonderful health options that are available today.  Fortunately my journalism degree from the University of Missouri and years of media experience gave me the confidence to tackle the challenge of a new health book.

									<h3>Dr. Darren  Wayne </h3>

										<p>
											My father passed away when I was ten years old. I was raised by my mother who taught me every day about food, and not only what to eat, but also exactly how to read labels on food products, so I could decide if it truly is healthy or not. I became very proficient at reading vitamin labels, too. Fast forward to present day and already I have spent over twenty years helping thousands live longer, healthier lives by teaching about the benefits of organic food. With the growing popularity of eating organic, still most people believe organic is just the same as other food and this is what junk food manufacturers want us all to think, which is why only drugs and junk food are advertised, never organic food. Organic Panic reveals the often unnoticed benefits of eating organic food and how the benefits of eating organic food are constantly being suppressed. You need to know this, because now in the 21st century, drugs are depended on more than food itself!

									<h3>T.S. Wiley</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											T.S. Wiley is the author of "Lights Out: Sleep, Sugar and Survival, ". Wiley succinctly and logically argues that electricity and the light bulb put us out of sync with nature as the ultimate "endocrine disruptors".
People spent summers, before electric lights, sleeping less and eating heavily in preparation for winter because the light triggered the hunger for carbohydrates. Now, light is available 24 hours a day. Heating and air-conditioning climate control our hormonal responses to consume carbohydrates now available year round. This is the scenario for obesity, Type II diabetes, and depression.
In Wiley's opinion, sleep is the best medicine.  Her newest work in process is "Manthropology", exploring how medicine and modern life are killing men. Find out more about the study of bio-identical, bio-mimetic HRT on her website, www.thewileyprotocol.com

									<h3>Elizabeth Yarnell</h3>
									<div>
										<p>
											Elizabeth Yarnell, ND, has a mission to improve lives simply by changing the way we eat.
Award-winning author, patented inventor, social entrepreneur, and prolific natural health and nutritional expert, Elizabeth strives to help people identify the foods and lifestyle elements that are healthy for them, and then to inspire new ways to think about living and eating. 
After a 1999 diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis forced her to take a good look at her own diet and lifestyle, she dove into researching the connection between what we eat and how we feel. The infusion cooking technique she subsequently invented and patented not only gave her a way to alter the course of her health, but also offered a deliciously quick and convenient weeknight dinner solution for just about anybody.
