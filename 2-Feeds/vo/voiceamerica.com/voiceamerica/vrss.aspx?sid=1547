    <title>Pit Pass USA with Larry Henry</title>
    <link>http://www.voiceamerica.com/rss/show/1547</link>
    <description>Pit Pass USA is about all forms of racing.  Pit Pass USA prides itself on not just being about Nascar or IndyCar or NHRA, or any one particular series.&lt;br&gt;
Pit Pass USA has conversations, not interviews with drivers, owners, crew chiefs, series officials, crew members and even the media. We want to hear their story, find out what makes them tick, and get their viewpoint on the sport.&lt;br&gt;
One thing that we strive for on Pit Pass USA is bringing the untold story to race fans.  That’s why one of our key goals is to talk to those that may not get much media attention but are working just as hard as the stars of the sport to make their dreams come true.&lt;br&gt;
Pit Pass USA is broadcast live every Wednesday at 4 PM Pacific Time on the Power Up Motorsports Series on the VoiceAmerica Sports Channel.</description>

      <description>Speedweeks kicks into high gear this weekend at Daytona with the Bud Shootout and qualifying for the Daytona 500.  We talk to last year’s surprise winner of the Great American Race Trevor Bayne.

While Bayne won last year, Mario Andretti took victory at Daytona in 1967.  Mario joins us to talk about that victory and more.

ARCA kicksoff its season at Daytona and the question is can anyone stop Bobby Gerhart.  He’s won 7 times at Dayton in 24 tries. He’ll stop by.

And Brian Keselowski was a big story at Daytona last year when brother Brad pushed him into the Daytona 500 during his Gatorade Duel. We talk to Brian about that and now turning into an ARCA team owner.</description>

      <description>The Daytona 500 was one for the record books. Just turned 20 year old rookie Trevor Bayne shocked the world by winning The Great American Race for the iconic Wood Brothers. Eddie Wood, co-owner of the winning car talks to us about what that victory means to them and how they celebrated.

Before Bayne’s victory, the feel-good story of the week was Brian Keselowski being pushed in a Gatorade Duel by his younger brother Brad into the starting lineup for the 500. We catch up with Brian and talk about what that moment might mean for his racing career.

And the NHRA Full Throttle Drag Racing season begins this weekend in Pomona, CA. Mopar Dodge Avenger driver Allen Johnson drops by.</description>
