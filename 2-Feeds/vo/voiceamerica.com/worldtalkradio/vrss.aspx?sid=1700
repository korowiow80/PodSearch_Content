			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon Jun 21 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - We all have areas of influence in our life. From the environment we live in, to the family, friends and people we associate with. Each and every person or situation will have a different type and level of influence that will in some way determine what in our lives, becomes possible. 

One of the more significant influences within life is the group of family, friends and colleagues that determine your circle of influence.

Bill has always tried to identify and understand the circle of influence of the people he works with and the type and extent of each of these influences. 

In this weeks edition of Success in Action Bill will discuss with Lindy his understanding on the topic of Circle of Influence and the role both positive and negative it will play in our journey of life.  And to ad his real life perspective, we will be joined by Craig Hamilton who through his own unforeseen personal experience, now completely understands the necessity and the role of The Circle of Influence.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon Jun 14 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Contests have winners and losers. Incentives have earners and non-earners. Life has success and failure. 

It is sometimes a tough journey.

However there is an on going need to consistently and honestly recognise and reward the small wins along your journey.  And as a result from this recognition and reward there will be a corresponding commitment, discipline and pursuit of what needs to be done to achieve the overall goals you desire.

In this weeks edition of Success in Action Bill will discuss with Lindy why it is important to not only set our milestones along the journey of success, but to also make sure we celebrate them when they are reached.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon Jun 7 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - How fast are you growing? As an individual your life quest should be to become the person you are capable of being and whole lot more. The development and growth of your knowledge, skill, awareness, understanding, and character should be an ongoing focus and therefore a life goal at every turn.

Undoubtedly you realise that continued growth and development is important, but do you live that realisation? 

In preparation for this weeks edition of Success in Action I would ask you to ponder this question: Is your rate of improvement and growth, less than, equal to, or more than that of the environment you operate in? 

Join in as Lindy and Bill provide you with a series of information that will see your rate of individual growth continue to increase. And to ad a completely different perspective to the discussion will be the drummer from Australian Rock Band, Silverchair, Ben Gillies.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon May 31 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Do you ever wonder why some people are able to become all they can be, while others struggle to get off first base? 

Is it desire, motivation, opportunity, discipline, excitement, hunger, incentive or ambition? 

More than likely, failure to achieve goals is due to, too much dreaming, hoping and yearning and not enough clarity, action and purpose.

Personal goal setting is a vital ingredient in the pursuit and attainment of success and positive outcomes. It can be the catalyst for change, the impetus to become better and the driver of achievement. 

True goal getting is never easy, however through listening in to this weeks edition of Success In Action, Lindy and Bill will make it easier for you to better understand what it takes to not only set your goals but how to take the right action so you actually achieve them.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon May 24 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Success is spoken about in relation to so many aspects of life. Sometimes, it becomes hard to focus on everything you need to do to pursue and attain your success. 

Living with a balanced approach so that you can achieve your goals or outcomes, is without doubt one of the great challenges of life.

But for this to happen you need clarity, understanding and perspective, but most of all, you will need commitment and discipline. The most important is a commitment to the discipline of daily action.That is, you are committed, to each and every day doing something that is going to take you that one step closer to the goals, dreams and ambitions that you have set for yourself. Hence Success-One Day At A Time. 

In this weeks edition of Success in Action Lindy will ask Bill to outline how it is we should approach our success one day at a time. And to help you understand the concept. Lindy and Bill will be joined by Quadriplegic Paralympian, adventurer and extreme sportsman Bob Staddon.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon May 17 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Never Give Up is easy to say when things are going well, not too easy to do when things are a little more grim. 

Never give Up should be a philosophy of life, it becomes a state of mind, a constant purpose and focus. So much so, that it becomes ingrained in you and everything that you do. 

But to have a philosophy of Never Give Up what does it take? To find out the answer to this question and to hear a lot more about the foundations from which to build your success join us on Success in Action as Lindy asks Bill to go into detail on the role, purpose and relevance of Discipline, Commitment, Resilience, and Responsibility.

And to bring an unrivaled perspective to this discussion Lindy and Bill will be joined by the true life inspiration for the Lifetime Television's Emmy-nominated original movie Homeless To Harvard,  Liz Murray.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon May 10 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - What is it that makes you reluctant to try new things?  What holds you back from improving or developing certain aspects of your life? What is the single defining factor that stops you from developing or embracing change in your life?

Fear. Yes I said it. And you probably did too.

Each and everyday we continue to hear or produce those excuses that are designed to hide our fear. The fear that stops you from moving forward in life. The fear that helps keep you in your own little zone of comfort. 

In this weeks edition of Success in Action The Queen of Why (Lindy Burns) will ask The Success Architect (Bill  Nelson) to outline how to make things better in your life by understanding why, how and when you should get out of your comfort zone on a regular basis. And to bring another perspective to this discussion Lindy and Bill have called on the services of one of the worlds greatest mountain climbers, Michael Groom to join them in the discussion.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon May 3 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - What is the best way to motivate myself? How can I best motivate my staff? Who is the most motivational person you have ever met? 

Question after question, all different but all with the same answer. Every situation and every individual are completely different.

There is only one commonality in regard to motivation and the people that seek it. 

Real motivation comes from within. True motivation is an internal emotion. An emotion that remains the responsibility of the person that wants to be motivated.

In this weeks edition of Success in Action Lindy will draw on Bill's experience to discuss how it is we should incorporate and benefit from the element of motivation and to ad a very different perspective to the conversation Lindy and Bill will be joined by record breaking solo around the world sailor Tony Mowbray.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon Apr 26 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Does everybody fail at one stage or another? Well, Yes to a certain degree they certainly do. You see the most interesting statistic from reviews on success is that people that pursue success, are not frightened about the thought of not succeeding. 

Why? Because they understand that failure is part of the journey of success.

It has often been said that to embrace success you need to understand failure. The most important lesson that you can learn from failure is that it is never permanent. You will always have the opportunity to learn from it, and to move on to bigger and better things due to your understanding and interaction with it.

In this weeks Success In Action Lindy will lead the discussion on how we work our way through dealing with failure and ask Bill why is it important to understand and value failure. And to help your understanding of the subject we will be joined by an expert in dealing with the element of failure, comedian Damian Callinan.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon Apr 5 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - I am quite sure that we all recognise that the element of change is a regular part of everyday life. You have no doubt heard the saying change only comes out of necessity and that necessity to change is either externally demanded or internally generated. Change either comes from drastic actions or an evolutionary adjustment or adaptation.

The one thing to remember as you go about dealing with change, is that it is happening around you in more areas than you probably care to imagine and in many facets of life. What was the norm yesterday will no longer be relevant tomorrow. (Think about that computer you bought last year?)

Therefore your ability, motivation and process to deal with change has a huge bearing on how change will be addressed and handled within all aspects of your life.

In this weeks edition of Success in Action Lindy will encourage Bill to part with some true life insight and strategies to deal with element of change within our life

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Mon Mar 15 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - We all aspire to greatness in one form or another. We all pursue success to varying degrees. We all attempt to scale the lofty heights of personal accomplishment. 

Each and every day step-by-step, bit-by-bit, you attempt to do what needs to be done to achieve your desired outcomes. 

You prevail through the trials and tribulations. You overcome the obstacles. You develop, exude and apply a level of focus, commitment and discipline to allow you to get to the top. 

But what is the top? What is your Everest? 

How do you view, describe and define success?

In preparation for the first edition of Success In Action take a minute or two and ponder those questions. Take some further time to think through your answers and then listen in as the Lindy Burns (The Queen of Why) and Bill Nelson (The Success Architect) discuss the importance, the purpose, the process and the benefits in defining success on your own terms.
