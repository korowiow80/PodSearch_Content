The baby must be hidden so that evil forces cannot find him/her.  The hero is schooled and shows great promise or knowledge beyond his/her years.  Then the hero travels far with help from friendly spirits.  Then the hero must slay a  monster to prove his exceptional strength and courage.  Then he finds a great truth or treasure and brings it back to his community.  Finally the hero must face death and travel to the underworld.  Finally the hero ascends to a glorious state.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Jul 15 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Dr. Margery Runyan, psychotherapist, discusses the practices of Dr. Carl Jung, a disciple of Sigmund Freud until they separated over theoretical differences. Dr. Jung believed that the unconscious had a collective component composed of symbolic energy nodes known as archetypes. Freud believed that the unconscious was filled solely with repressed personal material. Dr. Mercy contrasts ‘symbols' and ‘signs.'  A symbol belongs to the dream world and intuition; it resonates with deeper levels of meaning as it unfolds within the unconscious and bridges the gap to the consciousness. Signs are equations that have known meanings within the cultural consciousness.]]></description>

Sonya and Tonya believe in their hearts that they are identical. Their mother and father were not sure.  They are very similar in every way and have a strong telepathy which includes feelings each others' emotions and symptoms.  Their lives have also been similar, marrying husbands who were insecure about the twinship, having two children (boy and girl), and staying close until Tonya developed the disease of alcoholism.  The twins talk about this disease, how they coped, Tonya's recovery and their reunification.  Tonya has recently been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver and this second disease has challenged Tonya to remain hopeful and Sonya to face her twin's mortality. Dr. Mercy will speak with them again after a biopsy is performed in August.  Stay tuned.]]></description>

Identical twins offer an incredible resource to study the effect of genes or the environment on diseases like asthma or allergies. Dr. Nadeau discusses the design of her study, how twins can participate, and what preliminary differences they are finding in twins. She also provides the latest information on prevention and treatment of allergies and asthma. Dr. Nadeau became interested in twins as a mom of two sets of twins and shares her personal experiences as well as her clinical expertise.]]></description>

The twins lived together in the 17th arrondissement near the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysee. There Dr. Mercy was introduced to Antoine de Saint Exupery the famous pilot and author of The Little Prince. In ‘Le Petit Prince,' Saint Exupery describes his encounter in the desert with The Little Prince who comes from a tiny planet with three volcanoes and one rose. He tells of his travels to other planets in search of a friend and in the end learns his most important lesson from a Fox. Dr. Mercy tells his story with a depth of feeling reserved for the grandest of all lessons.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Jun 10 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Dr. Mercy discusses the process of synchronicity proposed by Dr. Carl Jung, a disciple of Sigmund Freud, a practicing psychiatrist in Switzerland during the 20th century, and a proponent of the collective unconscious. He used the term synchronicity to describe acausal events that occur simultaneously in the realm of Consciousness. In 'On the Nature of the Psyche,' Jung regretted that synchronicity is bound to the notion of Time. In mathematical terms, Time is the curvature of Space. Thus Jung concluded that the Archetypes have not only psychic reality but also relate in some fashion to the Space/Time continuum. Two events might occur at different times within the Unconscious where Time is distorted and then be linked in the Consciousness as if they occurred simultaneously. Dr. Mercy is thus compelled to speculate that Two Twins may have arrived on earth simultaneously even though in the realm of the Twin Archetype they have been joined outside of the human experience of Time. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Jun 3 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Ana and Isa 39-year-old identical twins have graciously agreed to guest on another program to spotlight their book and movie. Inspired by their 2007 memoir, "The Power Of Two" offers an intimate portrayal of the bond between half-Japanese twin sisters Anabel Stenzel and Isabel Stenzel Byrnes, their battle with the fatal genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) and miraculous survival through double lung transplants. Defying all odds, Ana and Isa have emerged as authors, athletes and global advocates for organ donation, and their connection to the CF and transplant communities provides rare insight into the struggles - and overlooked joys - of chronic illness. The twins' receiving new lungs would have been unlikely in their mother's native country, Japan, where organ donation rates are strikingly low. At the crux of a rising movement to change laws and stigmas, Ana and Isa embark on a tour of Japan to inspire change in the hearts and minds of a culture resistant to transplantation. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri May 20 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - Dr. Mercy will discss the experimental evidence for anomalous retroactive influences on cognition and affect, research recently published by Daryl Bem. The article is relevant to twins who are quite familiar with precognition or premonition of a future event that could not otherwise be anticipated
through any known process. Precognition and premonition are themselves
special cases of a more general phenomenon: the anomalous retroactive influence of
some future event on an individual's current responses, whether those responses are
conscious or nonconscious, cognitive or affective. This article reports 9 experiments,
involving more than 1,000 participants, that test for retroactive influence by "timereversing"
well-established psychological effects so that the individual's responses are
obtained before the putatively causal stimulus events occur.

Dr. Mercy will be discussing the patterns of twinship attributed to the characters in the novel and their importance in the structure of the novel.  Tune in and hear how Wally Lamb, a celebrated fiction writer and teacher, handles the twin theme.]]></description>

Karen is the only daughter of her mother Rae who has a twin sister Kae.  Rae and Kae were born in Columbus, Ohio, third and fourth children after their older sister Sue and brother Billy.  The twins were the last children born to an older mother. The father deserted them due to alcoholism. These two twins later had daughters exactly one month apart, one of whom is Karen.  The daughters were dressed alike and treated often as twins, although truly cousins.  Kae traveled with her husband in the military while Rae and Karen lived in Columbus, Ohio. After Karen graduated from high school she and her mom settled in Lee County, Florida. Rae now lives with her older sister Sue and down the street from her twin Kae. Rae's daughter Karen and her daughters also live nearby, and all benefit from the family support.]]></description>

Mother Margery and another daughter Anne were guests on an earlier Twin Talk program entitled Family Secrets available in the archives. Dr. Mercy speaks about her mother's life and then diverges into a discussion of ‘attachment' in primary relationships. Twins are believed to bond more closely with each other than the mother. Dr. Mercy reviews the attachment theory of John Bowlby, including the types of attachment (secure, ambivalent, avoidant), the problems related to insecure attachment, and methods to ameliorate related issues in psychotherapy.]]></description>

At 48, they are still as youthful and exuberant as always.  They were members of Tennessee Twins Ass'n for years and served as officers and were Chairpersons for the Mid South Fair Twins Contest for 10 years before the fair moved from Tennessee. Currently they are Co-Presidents of the International Twins Ass'n, their fourth time as Presidents. They have been going to the ITA Conventions since 15 when their mom took them to their first one in Memphis, TN.  Dr. Mercy met Linda and Brenda in Tempe, AZ at the ITA convention and fell in love with their spirits. These women are wives and moms. How do their husbands and children handle this amazing bond?  They are going to give us the inside scoop on 'the twin thing.'  The questions they will answer relate to all the fun stuff such as playing tricks on people, liking and disliking twinship, physical and medical similarities, and extra-sensory perception. ]]></description>

Dr. Mercy was recruiting identical twins to provide dreams for her dissertation 'Do Twins Dream Twin Dreams?'  The ITA twins were so extremely kind and helpful.  Dr. Mercy had already lost her twin many years ago and still experienced pain and grief there watching the other twins interact, dress alike, and love each other so much.  She did not have the heart to tell them about the pain of twin loss.  She and Sandy consoled several other twins who had recently lost their co-twins, and their pain was almost unimaginable. Sandy and Dr. Mercy met again at the Twinless Twin Support Group International conference in Denver the next year 2009. Now they are fast friends and will discuss everything 'twinnie' under the sun!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Mar 18 00:00:00 PDT 2011 Show - This program explores research on the embodiedness of body boundaries in the telesomatic experiences
of 20 adult twins. Respondents often experienced trouble making subject-object distinctions between themselves and
their co-twins that resulted in them posing the question, ‘Are we (myself and my co-twin) one body?' Their experiences suggest that sometimes symptoms of one illness are shared between two people. Their experiences also highlight the ethical
nature of individualism in western cultures as twins frequently do not view a greater level of attachment as pathological but as something special. Controversy regarding the status of parapsychological phenomena has resulted in researchers being reluctant to consider these and similar experiences as topics worthy of research.

The identical twin girls kept silent throughout their childhood speaking only to each other in their bedroom where they created elaborate doll fantasies, wrote books and poems, and kept profuse diaries.  They were destined to be confined to a maximum security psychiatric hospital for eleven years of their adult lives following an adolescent crime spree. For most of this time the twins were kept in separate quarters.  Released together in 1993, Jennifer died within hours of a mysterious cardiac condition and June returned to live with her family.  June now speaks.]]></description>

Gnosticism originated in numerous civilizations and ultimately became embedded in Christianity. Gnosis is the Greek word for ‘knowledge' and in this context means attaining the spiritual awareness of God and the intimate knowledge of One's Self as directly connected to God.  Dr. Carl Jung studied early Gnostic writings and gave these sects great credit for their discoveries of the archetypes, the unconscious, and the Anthropos or human prototype. The Gnostics believed in the dual nature of the cosmos, composed of spirit as different altogether from matter which was corrupted by the manner of its creation.]]></description>

His aunt revealed to him late in her life that his twin brother was relatively undeveloped and thus stillborn.  The brother was not named.  This family secret came as a revelation because Bob had always wanted a brother and at times had been sure that he did have a brother somehow somewhere. He did have two younger sisters and befriended many men throughout his life to fill this empty space of brotherhood.  Listen to Bob reflect on his lifetime from the perspective of 70 years of age, looking back on some of the most fascinating changes in society and in his own concept of the meaning of life.  He will discuss the experience of lost twinship, being raised as a singleton and only later discovering his true identity as a twin.  Raymond Brandt the founder of Twinless Twins believes in twin bonding in utero.  Bob will shed light on his missing pieces.]]></description>

She first demonstrates how to compute your own Life Number from your birth date.  Referencing Numerology for the New Age by Lynn M. Buess, she discusses the meaning of the sequence of numbers from one to nine in relation to their vibrations from cycle to cycle.  These cycles can be eras, lifetimes, projects, days, or micro-seconds.  The numbers each have different vibrational frequencies and meanings within the crescendo of each progressive cycle.  Dr. Mercy reviews the meanings of the Life Numbers and their positions within the cycle using the interpretations in Cheiro's Book of Numbers and the Tarot.  The twins of course are two and represent the first division of the Whole or God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Jan 14 00:00:00 PST 2011 Show - These beautiful young adult twins have reached a point in their development that fascinates clinicians and researchers.  They are moving out of the sheltered states of childhood and adolescence and learning to create their own lives.  Moving away from home, relocating to another state, finding jobs which match their credentials, evaluating potential partners, and planning for motherhood are all rites of passage which twins experience in different ways from singles.  Some of these rites occur earlier for one twin than the other, potentially creating stress and strain in the twinship.   The choices that they are making, together and apart, now have adult consequences and as Robert Frost has said in ‘The Road Not Taken' ‘knowing how way leads on to way' these choices will have a fundamental effect on the twinship in later years.  Listen to their points of view and world views on Twin Talk.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Dec 24 00:00:00 PST 2010 Show - If you are a twin, a parent of twins, or close to a twin, you will enjoy the interview with Dr. Barbara Klein, a twin herself and expert in childhood development. Dr. Klein will discuss the strong influences of parenting styles and early childhood experiences on the way in which co-twins relate to each other. These methods of twinning are covered in her book ‘Not All Twins Are Alike.'  She will also answer questions such as; ‘What is it like growing up as a twin? Do twins have difficulty in non-twin relationships? Why do twins fight? Why is twin loss so profoundly difficult for the surviving twin? Why should parents stress the individual differences between their twin children? How can we help gifted and challenged twins? What are the advantages of co-twins being different? Is twin dominance real?' Dr. Klein's twin Marjorie teaches rhetorical writing at Stanford University and Dr. Klein will surely comment on their relationship throughout the life stages of childhood and adulthood.]]></description>

These 10-year-old twins are participants in the study of Chinese twins now underway at the University of California at Fullerton by Dr. Nancy Segal, a fraternal twin herself and contributor to Twin Talk. The article which appears in the November issue of Readers Digest and Newsweek provides a beautiful illustration of ‘twinning.'  The program also covers methods to increase your dream recall and to influence your dreams by befriending your dream images, enhancing your dream pleasures and creating positive outcomes.  Dr. Mercy discusses the terminology and methods of qualitative Jungian dream interpretation and provides examples of dreams of female identical twins who lost their twins from her doctoral research.   ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Dec 10 00:00:00 PST 2010 Show - Pamela Daniel and Dr. Mercy met several years ago at a Twinless Twins conference in Denver, Colorado and became fast friends.  They understand and support each other in a special way that somehow defies explanation.   Dr. Mercy has been befriending twins continuously over the past few months and years.  Is there some special flavor to twins' relationships with other twins?   Why do twins seem to fall into our lives?  Do we have ways to attracting each other and relating that transcend family connections and friendships?  Do second born twins bond with other second born twins?  Do twins find other twins who complement or mirror each other?  What is the nature of the tie?  Of course, twins also twin with other people who are not twins. How does this process of twinning manifest?  Tune in to hear Dr. Mercy and Pamela discuss their experiences with twinning.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Dec 3 00:00:00 PST 2010 Show - These sets of twins from Texas fell in love, went on a double date to Las Vegas, and won thousands of dollars at poker. Sensing they were on a winning streak, they got engaged on the same day, married at a joint ceremony (officially "quarternary marriages"), and built a pair of homes, side by side. Soon afterwards, despite a million-to-one odds, Diane and Craig Sanders went on to have identical twins of their own - Colby and Brady, now nine. Both couples celebrated their 10th anniversaries in November, 2009. Diane and Craig are the parents of three sons, including identical twin boys Brady and Colby born in 2001 and their younger brother Holden born in 2005.  Darlene and Mark Sanders are the parents of two girls, Reagan born in 2001 and Landry born in 2003. Did one marital pair get the male genes and the other the female genes? These families are featured in Nancy Segal's book Indivisible by Two. Tune in to Twin Talk to hear about the 'twin stuff.']]></description>

As a fraternal twin, psychologist and researcher, Dr. Segal has been uniquely positioned to perform ground-breaking studies on twins including her work at the University of Minnesota with twins separated at birth and reunited in adulthood and her most recent study on the development of Chinese twins adopted internationally both apart and together. Her other research has included the behavioral similarities of virtual twins (same age unrelated children raised together) and the behavioral consequences of twin loss. Dr. Segal is considered one of the foremost experts on the nature versus nurture controversy based on her quantitative studies of twins' behaviors. Dr. Segal will be prepared to discuss the nature of twin relationships, twin development, twins accused of cheating at school.]]></description>

You can find her on About.com making practical suggestions to parents, grandparents, teachers, and other care givers who are baffled by the complex choices with multiples at all stages of development.  Should we dress them alike?  Should they be in the same class?  What if they fight over friends?  What shall we do if one excels in school and the other does not?  What if they fight with each other?  Pamela has written four books on these subjects and more.  Listen to Pamela's own experiences with her teenage twins and ask her the questions you have always wanted to ask about raising multiples.]]></description>

How do these healing practices work?  Why are we drawn to them and what do they signify for us in our own healing journey?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Oct 29 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Dr. Mercy and her guests will explore the topic of life stages and discuss whether twins have rites of passage that differ from singles.  The road of life is littered with surprising events when we know that nothing about us will ever be the same and seminal moments when we know that we must go forward because there is no turning back.  These benchmarks on the journey can be marked by rituals, holidays, chance meetings, life-long friendships, marriages, divorces, hospitalizations, incarcerations, spiritual awakenings, growth spurts, rituals, graduations, certificates, and deaths.  Are these states of transformation and maturation experienced in the same way by singles as by twins?  Do the same types of events precipitate change?  Is there an added complexity in the life stages of twins?  Tune in to hear the discussion.  Call if you want to participate!  1-866-613-1612]]></description>

He and Dr. Mercy met each other at Twinless Twins Support Group International during the 2009 annual conference in Denver.  They have since realized that they were destined to meet and create a deeply meaningful relationship as twins are here on this planet to do.  His love for his twin brother Ronnie ran wide and deep and he almost followed him into death and the afterlife.  Theresa's loving care for both twins since the age of 15 brought him back to life on earth.  She found him near death in a hospital where his older brothers had abandoned him to die.  If Theresa can get away from her job responsibilities as an engineer, she will join us briefly on the show to discuss her experiences with these extraordinary twins.  Sometimes love IS enough.]]></description>

They have both raised children, lived together and lived apart.  Kevin has older children and Keith has younger children.  How have their paths as husbands and fathers converged?  What differences have they experienced as husbands and fathers?  What aptitudes and interests do they share and how do they differ?  With luck, Tracy will call during the school day and perhaps the girls will call from their cell phones.  What is it like to be married to twins and have twins as fathers?  The girls are very gorgeous at the ages of 9, 7, and 6.  Tracy is an exceptional wife and mother.  Keith will talk about the experience of being married to an achievement-oriented woman who is working two jobs, raising three children, and completed her doctorate in her spare time.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Oct 1 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Denise and Deanne live on opposite coasts, Denise in New York and Deanne in California. Has this geographic separation taken a toll on their twinship?  One twin was extroverted and sought the companionship of her peers; the other was closer to the family and sought approval there.  They were close in their younger years and supported each other in hard times.  How did they find themselves so far apart in adulthood?  What forces and factors shaped each twin?  How are they alike and different?  How do they communicate now in maturity?  Do they still think of each other as identical twins and how do they express this bond?  This twinship is a fascinating story of twins with primarily non-shared experiences.  Their genes, aptitudes, intelligence, and interests are very similar, yet they have lived in two very different worlds both familiar to them from childhood.  Tune in and hear them discuss the choices they have made as women and identical twins.]]></description>

Does one theory work better than the others?  How do we know what works?  What is evidence-based psychotherapy?  What characteristics of the psychotherapist give the client the experience of getting better?  Several psychotherapists will join the program to discuss what works.  They will continue the discussion from last week with Dr. Barbara Klein about treating twins and share their experiences with twins.  What was the presenting problem and how did the psychotherapy proceed?  Is there any reason to believe that twins can perform psychotherapy with twins better than singles?  Twins may present with separation, loss of the twin, too much closeness, and difficulty resolving parental issues.  Please call if you are a twin in psychotherapy or a therapist treating twins.  Dr. Mercy will discuss ‘the twin in the transference' and share some of her own case experiences.  ]]></description>

If you have been a participant in a twin study perhaps through one of the large registries that exist through the United States and the world, we would love to hear your experiences. Twin studies can be cross-sectional or longitudinal; they often focus on the interrelationship among genetics, shared environment, and non-shared environment in order to determine the relative effects on personality, aptitudes, life experiences, and health. Some studies have been done with MRI technology to measure the size of fetal brains. Dr. Mercy will cover these resources and will also discuss the recent findings that identical twin DNA is not necessarily identical; she welcomes callers to discuss the implications of such results for society and the twins themselves. ]]></description>

A twin herself and expert in childhood development, Dr. Klein also has extensive clinical experience with twins in psychotherapy and would love to take questions from psychotherapists treating twins or twins ourselves on twin transference in psychotherapy, difficulties in adult twin relationships, the cognitive schema of twins, and the unconscious world of twins as expressed in dreams and associations.  She and Dr. Mercy will both dialogue with callers on some of the more complex and challenging issues faced by twins, our spouses, and parents.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Aug 27 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Dolores Nick (74), grandmother of three sets of twins, will describe her experiences. In her words, ‘the identical boy twins Skyler and Spender (18) dress the same everyday. The boys elected to share a college dorm room and want to marry twins. The identical girl twins prefer to dress differently. Sierra and Savana (12), best friends, have been through a lot of medical problems. Sierra is a three time cancer survivor, first diagnosed at three and again at five and six, now cancer free. For both sets of twins, it's never "I" it's always "We;" there is sharing, no personal space, and always someone to play with and talk to. Shane and Shyanne, 10-month fraternal twins, are different as night and day.  They were "womb mates" and little else is the same. They don't interact much with each other, as of yet, but seem to look for each other if one is sleeping and the other is awake.  Shane was supposed to be the "vanishing twin"......but never vanished.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Aug 20 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - In 1984, February 24th, I Pamela sat straight up in my bed at 5 a.m. Within an hour of the phone call, two officers knocked on the door. 
Wayne my twin brother had been killed, shot dead by his buddy, an alcoholic, Vietnam Vet who lived in the basement of his mother country home. He had shot and killed him, because he had a flashback. I have forgiven him; he knew not what he had done.

My life since then has been empty deep within. Perhaps in different mates over the years I have sought out someone to subliminally replace him. I still knew I was a twin, but no longer had one. In 1998 I discovered Twinless Twins Support Group International and was most blessed to be able to spend time with Raymond Brandt, founder of the group. Over the years past, I have lived in Southwest Florida for 12 years on the Gulf coast. Three years ago, I found myself moving back to Maryland to care for my mother and step father. In my spare time I ride and break horses and have a booth at the local antique ma]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Aug 13 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Dr. Susan Mehrtens, President of the Jungian Center for the Spiritual Sciences in Waterbury, Vermont, has been reading astrological charts and teaching the art and science of astrology to learners such as Dr. Mercy for many years.  She uses the Jungian approach to astrology in which the soul chooses its journey in the moment and place of birth.  Dr. Carl Jung studied and revitalized the ancient sciences of astrology and alchemy, and Dr. Mehrtens has also returned to the original sources in Medieval History.  She will discuss the astrological methods that she has adopted and apply them to the study of the astrological charts of twins.  These charts may reveal a deeper meaning of the decisions of twins to make a life journey together and become ‘separated at earth.'  Dr. Mehrtens will describe the similarities and differences in the charts, touching on the significance of the readings for twins in general.  Please join us.]]></description>

She is hoping to connect with people attending the festival during Twin Talk show time to discover what brings them to the festival, what do they love about it, and what experiences do they carry home into their lives.  The festival begins officially Friday, August 6 with a day of activities devoted to twins and their families.  The following two days are open to the public.  Anyone in the neighborhood of Cleveland may want to attend the weekend festivities including a parade Saturday morning, twin contests, and twin talent shows.

The keynote interview with Joan Woodward, author of "The Lone Twin" from London, England, will take place on Friday July 16, followed by Twinless Twin Testimonials and breakout groups: early loss, adult loss, teens, families and significant others of twinless twins. Individual twins attending the TTSGI conference will speak to Dr. Mercy about their experiences at the conference and its importance in their recovery. Testimonials from previous conferences: ‘It is a true miracle of transformation...from all alone in a darkness that only a twinless twin could know, to a family and network of Twinless Twins to start a new, healing journey. Nobody understood when I said how "alone" I felt or expressed that I didn't know how to be one.  No one has a clue what it's like to have half your soul ripped out. After half a century together as one, now I must be merely a half.'

These powers are both learned and innate. Sheilana will discuss the psychic abilities that she has discovered and practiced during her many years of energy healing. She will describe how she developed them and how others can cultivate such powers. The relationship of energetic healing to twins will be covered, and how Sheilana has experienced twinship in her practice.  Do twins have unique powers that connect them?  How is our soul journey different from singles?  How can we maintain a heightened awareness of our energies as twins?  What good can we do in the world?]]></description>

In this program, Playfair will discuss his firm belief in the reality of twin psychic abilities including mental and dream telepathy.  He will report the circumstances under which twin telepathy works best and provide powerful examples of this frequently reported and well documented experience. The scientific establishment has been reluctant to embrace the evidence for such telepathy and Playfair will discuss the continuing breach between rigorous scientific methods and paranormal documentation. He will also elaborate on the Big Five of psychic abilities: telepathy, precognition, remote viewing, telekinesis and spiritual healing in relation to twins. He will give examples of the utility of twin telepathy to families, communities, and society.  ]]></description>

The research compared 164 dreams of female identical twins with the dreams of female norms developed by Hall and Van de Castle to support the content analysis of dreams. Hundreds of researchers have used these scales and norms, making them the most widely used quantitative tools in dream study.  Dr. Mercy will present the methods and significant results with commentary by Dr. Van de Castle. 

Dr. Van de Castle participated in many laboratory studies of dream telepathy and was considered one of the best telepathic senders. He will reminisce about his experiences as lab subject with the greatest dream researchers of our era. He will also present his ideas for future twin research and his own plans as scientist and author.

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri May 21 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Paula Abdullah is the mother of five teenage children living in Decatur, Illinois. Four of the teens are two sets of twins, one set boys and one set girls. Paula will tell her story as a mom and on-going survivor of the twice-twins experience. Her daughter Shalynn is now 19 and will tell her story as the big sister of two sets of twins. OMG.  Paula will share how she managed the shocks, the struggles, the joys, the incredible miracles. How did her husband fare? Did anyone ever sleep? Shalynn will share her experience of being an only child and then inundated with siblings. What role has she played in the family?  Paula and Shalynn will also report on the twins themselves, the relationships within and between the sets of twins, the myths of the first and second born, the good and bad twin, and the dominant twin. How have the twins grown through childhood and adolescence?  And because twins have different inner lives, how has their household been changed by the 'twinning?' ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri May 7 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Program Description: Twin loss triggers the most devastating grief ever studied per Segal (4.9.10 episode). In the first show, two identical female twins still recovering from their co-twins' deaths tell their stories of descent into hell and the quest for acceptance and wholeness as a single twin. The experiences of sudden death by suicide and wasting, lengthy illness will provide a stark contrast in the grief process. They will discuss their twinship bond and how that bond continues to manifest after death. Both women came out as lesbians during their lifetimes while the co-twins remained heterosexual. In the second episode, they will discuss the process of sexual revelation that occurred and their manner of coping with this profound difference in life style from the beloved identical twin. Science has not yet found some of the questions but these women have found their own answers.  They will interweave their stories, finding the similarities and differences in their twin journeys.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Apr 23 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Dr. Jane Greer has lectured across the country on marital/family problems, women's issues, and sibling (twin) issues.  She is frequently contacted by the national news media to speak as an authority on these topics. In her book, The Afterlife Connection, Dr. Greer began with the belief that the bond that exists between the living and the dead including co-twins is not purely a psychological one, but is in fact much more dynamic and empowering. Dr. Greer guides us to learn that transcommunication is not simply a "hello from heaven" but a powerful therapeutic tool that is available to any of us. Through transcommunication, the pain of grieving can be made more bearable, ambivalent relationships can be healed, and a loved one's messages can bring relief and joy. Drawing on her new book, What About Me? Dr. Jane will help us understand the sharing, connection and selfishness that can lead to Twin Rivalry.  Please join her on Twin Talk April 23 at 11am ET.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Apr 9 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - Dr. Nancy Segal, Professor of Psychology and Director of Twin Studies at the California State University, Fullerton, will be discussing her life time of research on twins. As a fraternal twin, psychologist and researcher, Dr. Segal has been uniquely positioned to perform ground-breaking studies on twins including her work at the University of Minnesota with twins separated at birth and reunited in adulthood and her most recent study on the development of Chinese twins adopted internationally both apart and together. Her other research has included the behavioral similarities of virtual twins (same age unrelated children raised together) and the behavioral consequences of twin loss. Dr. Segal is considered one of the foremost experts on the nature versus nurture controversy based on her quantitative studies of twins' behaviors. Dr. Segal will be prepared to discuss the nature of twin relationships, twin development, twins accused of cheating at school.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[60 min. from Fri Apr 2 00:00:00 PDT 2010 Show - If you are a twin, a parent of twins, or close to a twin, you will enjoy the interview with Dr. Barbara Klein, a twin herself and expert in childhood development. Dr. Klein will discuss the strong influences of parenting styles and early childhood experiences on the way in which co-twins relate to each other. These methods of twinning are covered in her book ‘Not All Twins Are Alike.'  She will also answer questions such as; ‘What is it like growing up as a twin? Do twins have difficulty in non-twin relationships? Why do twins fight? Why is twin loss so profoundly difficult for the surviving twin? Why should parents stress the individual differences between their twin children? How can we help gifted and challenged twins? What are the advantages of co-twins being different? Is twin dominance real?' Dr. Klein's twin Marjorie teaches rhetorical writing at Stanford University and Dr. Klein will surely comment on their relationship throughout the life stages of childhood and adulthood.]]></description>
