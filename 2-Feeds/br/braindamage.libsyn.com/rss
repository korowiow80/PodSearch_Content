            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Show #175, Release date: 4. September, 2011</strong><br /><br />I found an amazing recording out of Providence, Rhode Island from Roger's 2000, "In The Flesh" tour. The name of the bootleg is "Devine Providence" and its the source for this podcast.&nbsp; The quality was excellent without tweaking but as usual, it's been doctored up for super sound, big time.&nbsp; In addition to the EQ'ing and whatnot, I removed (as best I could) as much wooo'ing, whistling, and any other annoying crowd noise.&nbsp; I explain more in the podcast but this could totally pass for an official recording. Hope you dig it.</p>

<p>In keeping with the tradiition of featuring each Wall show I've been to, here is the latest (for now).&nbsp; Going to this gig in the West Midlands region of the UK was completely unexpected.&nbsp; ...from the plane to the train in London to the show at the NIA with backpack in hand.&nbsp; I was fortunate to attend and now you too can bask it's sonic bliss.&nbsp; Shortly after returning home I discovered two different recordings.&nbsp; So I mixed the two together and wow... from The NIA, Birmingham, UK, 27. June, 2011.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to post this for a few days but there was tweaking that still needed to be done. I think it's ready now. Enjoy!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Show #163, Release date: 2. December, 2010</strong><br /><br />Okay, it's been a long time no hear... It's podcast time.&nbsp; This was my seventh show and hopefully I'll get to see more but for now this will be the last of 'The Wall Concert Series'.&nbsp; For this, its the 6th of November from New York's Madison Square Garden. It was my first time at MSG and I thought it was interesting (and annoying) how venue's concession people were hawking during the show.&nbsp; You may notice a few "ice cold beers here" and the refreshing sound of one or two being cracked open. The Band sounded great and it comes across nicely on the recording, but it did need a little doctoring up.&nbsp; Enjoy and thanks for being so patient.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Show #162, Release date: 31. October, 2010</strong></p>
<p>Happy Halloween!&nbsp; Continuing on with 'The Wall Concert Series', from Hartford, CT., 15th October at the XL center.&nbsp; Its a very compact venue with a concert seating capacity of 16,606.&nbsp; The venue was formally known as The Hartford Civic Center and was the former home of The Hardford Whalers.&nbsp; Pink Floyd played here back in 1987.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was my 6th time seeing the show.&nbsp; Not many recordings exist of this night and this is one of only two I know of.&nbsp; I explain <em>a few things</em> about the recording and I also provide three easy steps for getting that perfect recording.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you think you might be interested in recording concerts and for more information on equipment and what to do, please visit <a href="http://www.soundprofessionals.com">The Sound Professionals</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A big thank you to RogFan for the recording.</p>

<p>A big thank you to Ravingandrooling for a tremendous capture of a show and for entrusting me with the original files.&nbsp; With those files, I was able to lift the sound during the quieter moments, enhance the space,EQ, and apply few other tricks.&nbsp; I use the car test.&nbsp; If it sounds good in a car, it&rsquo;s going to sound good through anything.&nbsp; Tested and approved... doctored up for supersound!</p>

September 2010.&nbsp; This is the first night of a three night engagement with today off for the band and crew.&nbsp; Roger's last show in Boston is tomorrow before heading off to NYC (Yankees still suck).&nbsp; In case you are wondering about the title, it's "Roger" said yelled in a Boston accentA big thank you to JB and Deb1 for getting this out so quickly.&nbsp; Its an excellent recording but as always I doctored it up for supersound!&nbsp;
If you would like to read more about this and the other Boston shows as well as other past gigs on this tour, check out my friend's blog, "Where ya been, where ya going?".&nbsp; Its an excellent read and its updated constantly as he travels with the band.Photo by: Doc (with an iPhone4 from the Floor, section J, Row 7, seat 10, 30.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Show #159, Release date: 1. October, 2010<br /></strong><br />And so it continues.&nbsp; Perhaps a concert series?&nbsp; Tell me what you think.&nbsp; Anyway, The first US date kicked off in Chicago's United Center, 20. September 2010.&nbsp; I won't post the setlist, BUT Again... the setlist should come as no surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a first time for many seeing this intense production.&nbsp; It was my first time.&nbsp; I have a "no pee during a show" policy but close to the end of the first set, nature called and I couldn't hold it anymore.&nbsp; The cool thing was I felt like Pink during the bathroom scene in the film because of the concert noise in the background.&nbsp; You gotta try it! Anyway, I had such a blast meeting up with everyone from AFG again and I even got to meet some great new people.&nbsp; It was a very special time.<br /><br />For this podcast, I took two recordings and blended them together.&nbsp; One by Ravingandrooling which I doctored up and another by Tapehead2, from his 2nd version.&nbsp; It sounds mindblowing!&nbsp; You be The Judge.&nbsp; Get it?&nbsp; Enjoy!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Show #158, Release date: 19. September, 2010</strong><br /><br />Yeah I know... the title is Gilmour/Floyd but its appropriate.&nbsp; If you are/were unable to visit Chicago for Roger's performance of The Wall, then this is for you.&nbsp; The AFG forum member events are a special thing and sharing the fun with as many people as possible is what it's all about. RonToon of Harvested Records assembled a great collection of Roger Waters' songs, a soundtrack if you will for a dinner gathering at Gino's East in downtown Chicago.&nbsp; I asked Ron if it would be cool to post this as a podcast at the exact same time its played for everyone at the dinner. So in spirit, you too can be with us as well.&nbsp; No playlist folks... for this, we wish you were here.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />Running Time: 2h:15m:52s</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Show #157, Release date: 17. September, 2010</strong><br /><br />And so it begins.&nbsp; The first of many shows from perhaps one of Roger's most anticipated tours since leaving Pink Floyd nearly 30 years ago.&nbsp; The Wall 2010!<br /><br />If you rather not spoil it for yourself, then don't listen but resistance is futile.&nbsp; The recording is decent but it badly needed some tweaking. It was far too bassy, so I fixed that up and doctored it for supersound.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>
<p>Air Canada Centre Toronto, Ontario, Canada, 15. September 2010.&nbsp; I removed the set list but it should come as no surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Musicians:</strong><br />Drums: Graham Broad<br />Guitars: Dave Kilminster, G.E. Smith, Snowy White<br />Bass: Roger Waters<br />Keyboards: Jon Carin, Harry Waters<br />Lead Vocals: Robbie Wyckoff, Roger Waters<br />Backing Vocals: Jon Joyce, Mark Lennon, Pat Lennon, Kipp Lennon</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Show #155, Release date: 16. August, 2010</strong></p>
<p>This podcast is a huge improvement to <a href="http://braindamage.libsyn.com/_echoes_in_the_garden_">Show #56</a> - It took forever to do this.&nbsp; Honestly I'm glad its done but I'm so enjoying the rewards of having a killer sounding recording and now you can too. This one is made up of two sources painstakingly mixed together.&nbsp; You really get a feel for the space.</p>
<p>The Boston Garden was a great place to see a concert.&nbsp; It was built at the cost of 4 million dollars in 1928 by the same people who built New York's Madison Square Garden.&nbsp; It was originally called&nbsp; Boston's Madison Square Garden and eventually "Madison Square" was dropped from the name.&nbsp; The Garden was demolished in 1997.</p>
<p>The Floyd live at The Garden, 18. June, 1975.&nbsp; Most enjoyable are the performances of You Gotta Be Crazy, which is different from both the 74 and 77 Dogs versions.&nbsp; The set also has great versions of Any Colour You Like and one of the last pre-87 performances of Echoes.&nbsp; <br /><br />Before that, I have for you, audio of the video footage from the Hoping Foundation gig featuring David Gilmour and Roger Waters.&nbsp; Please, if you can, give to the <a title="The HOPING Foundation" href="http://www.hopingfoundation.org/">HOPING Foundation!</a></p>
<p><br /><strong>Kiddington Hall, Oxfordshire, UK, 10. July 2010.&nbsp; </strong><br />01. To Know Him Is To Love Him<br />02. Wish You Were Here<br />03. Comfortably Numb<br />04. Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)<br /><br /><strong>Boston Garden, Boston, MA, 18. June, 1975</strong><br /><em>Mixed from two recordings merged together.</em><br /><em>- The Hopkins recording - floor section CC, row 10, seat 14.&nbsp; (<a href="http://prrp-music.org/prrp053/index.htm">PRRP053H</a>)</em><br /><em>- The Lampinski recording - section BB, row 5, seat 6.&nbsp; (<a href="http://prrp-music.org/prrp053/index.htm">PRRP053L</a>)</em><br /><br /><strong>Set 1</strong><br />01.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Show #154 Release date: 25. July, 2010</strong></p>
<p>Actually I didn't frame Roger.&nbsp; Good friend and long time Brain Damaged listener Barry BURBs hit me up with a smashing good mix framed in the proper light.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I'm deeply immersed in my latest matrix project and with Roger making all the buzz lately, this seems rather fitting.&nbsp; I always love when listeners generate content so keep em coming!&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Barry's request and in keeping with his podcasting style there will be no playlist for his one.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fun listen!&nbsp; Don't forget to please leave your comments!&nbsp; Thank you and enjoy!<br /><br />Running time: 1h:21m:23sec</p>

The purpose was to present each track in the best possible quality. The process was long because it was performed on a track by track basis. For each song, we had to compare many different sources in order to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each version and then decide which one(s) to work on. The mastering work was done very carefully, trying to repair every flaw that could be corrected... and there were a lot (tape warble, crackles, drop-outs, incorrect speed, etc)."</em>&nbsp; Enjoy!<br /><br />Note: The Harvested release contains more tracks than whats here.&nbsp; Mmwwahahahaaa!<br /><br />Playhouse Theater, London, 25.

            <description><![CDATA[<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Hello braindamaged listeners...&nbsp; I figured I'd pop in and give a little update just in case you are wondering where/when the podcast is...&nbsp; It's in the works and has been for a while...&nbsp; I am considering posting something in the meantime but I'm so immersed in what I'm currently doing, its hard to think of something else.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Anyway...&nbsp; During the Holiday break I was given a recording of a Floyd gig from the taper himself.&nbsp; Funny thing too is I met the taper at the exact spot where it was recorded 22 years ago.&nbsp; That's a hint by the way...&nbsp;&nbsp; His recording is really good, with little crowd noise but had a lot of hiss.&nbsp; Not long after, I found another recording of the same gig but the sound was much better but had crowd noise and two very wasted girls nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to each intently, I discovered that one recording picked up particular sounds that the other didn't and vice versa.&nbsp; I know the venue very well (there's another hint)&nbsp; and I can tell where each taper was located just from listening...but anyway, it got me thinking how it would sound if I put the two together.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s what I've been working on.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">I already remastered both but more so with the better sounding of the two and I'm using the lesser one as an ambient filler if you will.&nbsp; The process of syncing the two recordings is very tedious due to the recordings being at different speeds and to top it off the speed shifts throughout the lesser recording making the process even more difficult.&nbsp; The result however dramatically adds to the atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't wait to finish it. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;">Thanks for your patience!</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Hello braindamaged listeners...&nbsp; I figured I'd pop in and give a little update just in case you are wondering where/when the podcast is...&nbsp; It's in the works and has been for a while...&nbsp; I am considering posting something in the meantime but I'm so immersed in what I'm currently doing, its hard to think of something else.
Anyway...&nbsp; During the Holiday break I was given a recording of a Floyd gig from the taper himself.&nbsp; Funny thing too is I met the taper at the exact spot where it was recorded 22 years ago.&nbsp; That's a hint by the way...&nbsp;&nbsp; His recording is really good, with little crowd noise but had a lot of hiss.&nbsp; Not long after, I found another recording of the same gig but the sound was much better but had crowd noise and two very wasted girls nearby.&nbsp;&nbsp; After listening to each intently, I discovered that one recording picked up particular sounds that the other didn't and vice versa.&nbsp; I know the venue very well (there's another hint)&nbsp; and I can tell where each taper was located just from listening...but anyway, it got me thinking how it would sound if I put the two together.&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s what I've been working on.&nbsp;
I already remastered both but more so with the better sounding of the two and I'm using the lesser one as an ambient filler if you will.&nbsp; The process of syncing the two recordings is very tedious due to the recordings being at different speeds and to top it off the speed shifts throughout the lesser recording making the process even more difficult.&nbsp; The result however dramatically adds to the atmosphere.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't wait to finish it. &nbsp;
Thanks for your patience!
Doc]]></itunes:subtitle>

			<title>Yet another setback...</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/braindamage/Harddrive_platters.jpg]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<br/>My worst nightmare has come to fruition... A few days ago, one of my 4 year old, raid'ed internal harddrives decided it had enough.&nbsp; In the process of fixing this (having to replace both drives), I accidentally deleted a partition in my external back up drive holding all my production programs, elements and even some music.&nbsp; This caused a massive problem because when a partition is deleted, the machine won't see the drive and all its wonderful data.&nbsp; <br/><br/>I was able to  recover most and I hope all the data which was very time consuming (14 hours) not to mention very stressing on my external drive.&nbsp; The next step is to do a back up again but I have to get another drive (1tb) to do so (hopefully today).&nbsp; <br/><br/>So to make a long boring story short and boring... I'm hosed until further notice.&nbsp; At the rate I'm going, it should not be long but there will be a lot of backing up, reinstalling, reconfiguring, testing and all that happy horse poop.<br/><br/>So, again... (this hasn't been my year) there will be no podcast this week and there is a 50/50 percent chance there will be one the following week.&nbsp; This has turned out to be a costly and time  consuming  process so your patience is much appreciated.<br/><br/>Best,<br/>Doc<br/><br/>]]></description>

A few days ago, one of my 4 year old, raid'ed internal harddrives decided it had enough.&nbsp; In the process of fixing this (having to replace both drives), I accidentally deleted a partition in my external back up drive holding all my production programs, elements and even some music.&nbsp; This caused a massive problem because when a partition is deleted, the machine won't see the drive and all its wonderful data.&nbsp; I was able to  recover most and I hope all the data which was very time consuming (14 hours) not to mention very stressing on my external drive.&nbsp; The next step is to do a back up again but I have to get another drive (1tb) to do so (hopefully today).&nbsp; So to make a long boring story short and boring... I'm hosed until further notice.&nbsp; At the rate I'm going, it should not be long but there will be a lot of backing up, reinstalling, reconfiguring, testing and all that happy horse poop.So, again... (this hasn't been my year) there will be no podcast this week and there is a 50/50 percent chance there will be one the following week.&nbsp; This has turned out to be a costly and time  consuming  process so your patience is much appreciated.Best,Doc]]></itunes:subtitle>

this installment, we go to Municipal Stadium, Cleveland, OH, 25. June
1977.&nbsp; American shows in the summer of 1977 were particularly rowdy,
but this recording is probably most notable for the numerous cries of
“SIT DOWN!” throughout the show. Fortunately, the music on this release
comes out on top for the majority of the show.&nbsp; The occasional
fireworks set off yet Roger manages to keep his cool during this
performance but by this time in tour he was already becoming agitated
by the carefree behaviour of these massive audiences.&nbsp; Roger can be
heard shouting “46&quot; during <span style="font-style: italic;">Pigs (3 Different Ones)</span>
after the second verse, which is one of the identifiers for the
concerts on this tour, however he must have lost count because this was
actually the 47th show.<br/><br/>The podcast kicks off with Jeff Beck live, last week at the Royal Albert Hall with David Gilmour as surprise guest, performing <span style="font-style: italic;">Jerusalem.</span><br/><br style="font-weight: bold;"/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set One:</span><br/>01. Sheep<br/>02. Pigs On The Wing (Part 1)<br/>03. Dogs<br/>04. Pigs On The Wing (Part 2)<br/>05. Pigs (3 Different Ones)<br/><br/><span style="font-weight: bold;">Set Two:</span><br/>06.

<p class="MsoNormal">Halloween has always been a flagship holiday in the jam band
community, second only to New Year's Eve. And with a band like <a href="http://www.mule.net/">Gov't Mule</a>,
expecting something special is more than fair. Phish are attributed with
getting the Halloween spirit going in the jam world with a performance of The
Beatles' The White Album in its entirety on 10.31.94. Years later, we've seen
costumes and covers of all colors and genres. But, on Halloween 2008, Mule
outdid themselves with a second set packed full of Pink Floyd tunes from
throughout the psychedelic pioneers' career.*</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/><b>Show #105 Release
date: 22. February, 2008<o:p></o:p></b><br/><br/>On the 23<sup>rd</sup> of May 1968, Pink Floyd performed
three shows in one evening.<span>&nbsp; </span>One gig was
just outside <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">Amsterdam</st1:city></st1:place>
but the other two were at Paradiso.<span>&nbsp; </span>



<p class="MsoNormal">The venue was once an old church and has high ceilings and a
balcony overlooking the stage area.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Imagine how cool it must have been watching Floyd perform <i>A Saucerful of Secrets</i> with three large
illuminated stained glass windows above the stage.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
















<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p></o:p>These two gigs took place within the first six months of

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Show #105 Release
date: 22. February, 2008On the 23rd of May 1968, Pink Floyd performed
three shows in one evening.&nbsp; One gig was
just outside Amsterdam
but the other two were at Paradiso.&nbsp; 



The venue was once an old church and has high ceilings and a
balcony overlooking the stage area.&nbsp;
Imagine how cool it must have been watching Floyd perform A Saucerful of Secrets with three large
illuminated stained glass windows above the stage.&nbsp; 
















These two gigs took place within the first six months of
Paradiso’s opening as a publicly-subsidized youth entertainment center.&nbsp; It was also one of the first locations in
which the use and sale of soft drugs was tolerated, so space out and enjoy.Show One1. Let There Be More Light2. Interstellar Overdrive3. Set The Controls for The Heart of The Sun4. A Saucerful of Secrets

This podcast features an excellent recording taken from the soundboard on the 9th August, 1969 at The Paradiso in Amsterdam.&nbsp; The gig was recorded by Dutch radio station Hilversum 3 for a future broadcast unfortunately a microphone failure on the bands vocals forced them to perform an instrumental set.&nbsp; As a result the gig never aired.&nbsp; The recording surfaced recently with a short set of four numbers with absolutely no vocals, but the sound quality is amazing.

to jam with Pink Floyd let alone be able to jam with Pink Floyd.&nbsp; 












“Frank Zappa is really one of those rare musicians that can
play with us. The little he did in Amougies was terribly correct. But he's the
exception. Our music and the way we behave on stage, makes it very hard to
improvise with us.? - Nick Mason (commenting on playing with other musicians)











The two progressive rock planets collided on the 25th of
October, 1969 at The Actuel Festival in Amougies,
 Belgium.&nbsp; Recently, in the last year an audience
recording finally surfaced.&nbsp; Its not the
best recording but its all we got.

date: 4. August, 2007
















Roger’s KAOS on the
road tour lasted only three months and was predominately a North American
tour.&nbsp; Many of Rogers’
gigs were canceled due to poor ticket sales perhaps largely in part by the
fact that Pink Floyd was also touring North America
at around the same time. 
















Only two soundboard recordings of live KAOS exist.&nbsp; Both were later broadcast and have FM quality reception so it adds to the &quot;radio&quot;
feel.&nbsp; This podcast is a mix of those two, one being
mostly from Quebec
and the other, recorded two weeks later from Wembley.&nbsp; The remaining gaps were filled using audio taken from an amateur video recording in Quebec.&nbsp; Unfortunately not every song performed was broadcast and there are no complete
soundboard gigs from this tour.&nbsp; Even the audience recordings seem to
be scarce.

date: 11. May, 2007




Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking
was Waters' first solo project and tour. Original demos were done at the same time as The Wall demos were made and when
presented to the band the others rejected Pros
And Cons in favor of The Wall.&nbsp; Its about a series of dreams about a guy
dealing with a mid-life crisis in a motel room.&nbsp;
Sound familiar?&nbsp; We go back to 22.
July 1984 at The Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey.










Before we dive into Pros And Cons, we start this podcast off with three tracks from the &quot;Syd&quot; Barrett, Madcap's Last Laugh
tribute show last night (10. May 2007) at London's
Barbican Centre.&nbsp; Roger Waters performs Flickering Flame.&nbsp; David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason
perform Arnold
Layne. We'll also hear all the artists (except Roger Waters) cap off the
evening with Bike.&nbsp; Remember, you heard it here first.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Show #80 Release date: 16. March, 2007Pink Floyd's stellar performance at the&nbsp;legendary Filmore West in San Francisco, 29. April, 1970.&nbsp;&nbsp;


&quot;Recorded on Pink Floyd's third American tour, this show introduced San Francisco to some of the newer material from the Ummagumma LP, and a taste of things soon to come on the Atom Heart Mother LP, to be released later that year. This San Francisco audience is particularly quiet and attentive, a fact that seems to have facilitated a more intimate, unique and focused performance than other dates on this tour&quot; - Wolfgang's Vault.



Doctored for super sound.&nbsp; Enjoy

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-weight: bold;">DJ shines on with help of Floyd enthusiasts</span><br/></p>







<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">By: <a href="http://www.thedailyaztec.com/" title="Fernando Ramos, Staff Writer" set="yes" _base_href="http://www.thedailyaztec.com/">Fernando Ramos, Staff Writer</a><br/><strong style="font-weight: normal;">Issue date:</strong> 2/1/07 <strong style="font-weight: normal;">Section:</strong>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Podcasts aren't anything new.<br/>
<br/>
In essence, they're audio files that a user downloads onto his computer and
plays on any audio player - most popularly on iTunes, although Winamp and
Windows Media Player also suffice. The topics range from radio-show archives to
commentary tracks for TV episodes. Sometimes, one gets the impression that the
&quot;talk&quot; format has utterly eclipsed the tried-and-true musical format.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, there are also podcasts you can listen to at www.thedoctor.cc, such
as the Pink Floyd-centric show &quot;Brain Damage.&quot; Billed as &quot;The
definitive Pink Floyd radio show&quot; at the start of every episode, it's
difficult to argue with such bold claims. Hosted by &quot;The Doctor,&quot; a
pseudonym for professional <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Boston</st1:place></st1:city>
radio personality Matt Leonard, the show focuses almost exclusively on live
shows and rarely heard demo tapes from the broad spectrum of Pink Floyd's
journey.<br/>
<br/>
As the mastermind behind the album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; -
famous for its 741 week reign on the Billboard Top 200 chart and carrier of the
song from which the podcast takes its title - Pink Floyd requires little
introduction.<br/>
<br/>
A fascinating mixture of furious guitar work, biting social commentary and bold
experimentation in both its aural design and highly stylized visual live shows
that have resisted the test of time, the band has rightfully earned its place
standing tall among the giants of rock. As such, a show such as &quot;Brain
Damage&quot; is nothing short of a gold mine.<br/>
<br/>
The Doctor elaborated on the origins of the show.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The whole thing came about when I was doing a cool rock radio show
playing kick-ass tunes at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Tufts</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype w:st="on">University</st1:placetype></st1:place>'s radio

Floyd feature. Eventually a few listeners and a good friend kept nagging me to
do a regular Floyd show.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was able to take shape when The Doctor was given a lucky break.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was scheduled a huge block of time,&quot; he said. &quot;I ended up
splitting the time into two shows, the later half being a Floyd show. That's
how it all started.&quot;</p>













<p style="margin-left: 40px;" class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, the show was canceled a short while later,
but after much shopping on The Doctor's part to other universities and Internet
radio stations that weren't interested, he still wasn't ready to close his
practice.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I thought to myself, 'Screw it, I'll podcast the show,'&quot; The Doctor
said.<br/>
<br/>
Despite his initial worries of losing his audience from the transition, he
built his own studio from the ground-up.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The first podcast was right on schedule, and my audience followed,&quot;
The Doctor said. &quot;The show (is) now accessible anytime and could be
listened to anywhere.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What followed was a boon for the Pink Floyd enthusiast and classic rock fans
alike. On a regular (usually biweekly) basis, The Doctor injects each podcast
with about a two-hour dose of Floydian goodness.<br/>
<br/>
Each episode has a unifying theme ranging from the complete live performances
to more esoteric &quot;Floyd's Worst Moments&quot; - a collection of various
technical blunders and, most amusingly, singer Roger Waters' infamous temper
tantrums. It's these latter shows that make the podcast so much fun for both
the listeners and the host.<br/>
<br/>
The Doctor says he's proud of quite a few shows, but Podcast No. 67, &quot;One
of Your Turns,&quot; is his personal favorite.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That one featured the audience,&quot; he said. &quot;I asked listeners to
send me their own introduction for the song of their choice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The final effect, hearing the listeners share memories they have associated
with the selections, is similar to a particularly trippy episode of National
Public Radio's &quot;This American Life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One fact that may surprise some listeners, given the continuing controversy
over MP3 distribution, is the Recording Industry Association of America is
mostly hands-off with the show.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They seem not to mind what I'm doing,&quot; The Doctor said. &quot;The
RIAA has no authority over unauthorized material, which is mostly what I
feature, and Pink Floyd doesn't seem to mind. If they tell me to stop, I
will.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn't seem to be anytime soon. Shows are still being updated, and The
Doctor isn't secretive about the fun he has recording it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Meeting the people around the world that all dig a similar interest in
Floyd is most rewarding,&quot; he said. &quot;I get to combine my two passions:
radio and Floyd.&quot;<br/>

DJ shines on with help of Floyd enthusiasts

Podcasts aren't anything new.

In essence, they're audio files that a user downloads onto his computer and
plays on any audio player - most popularly on iTunes, although Winamp and
Windows Media Player also suffice. The topics range from radio-show archives to
commentary tracks for TV episodes. Sometimes, one gets the impression that the
&quot;talk&quot; format has utterly eclipsed the tried-and-true musical format.

Thankfully, there are also podcasts you can listen to at www.thedoctor.cc, such
as the Pink Floyd-centric show &quot;Brain Damage.&quot; Billed as &quot;The
definitive Pink Floyd radio show&quot; at the start of every episode, it's
difficult to argue with such bold claims. Hosted by &quot;The Doctor,&quot; a
pseudonym for professional Boston
radio personality Matt Leonard, the show focuses almost exclusively on live
shows and rarely heard demo tapes from the broad spectrum of Pink Floyd's
journey.

As the mastermind behind the album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; -
famous for its 741 week reign on the Billboard Top 200 chart and carrier of the
song from which the podcast takes its title - Pink Floyd requires little
introduction.

A fascinating mixture of furious guitar work, biting social commentary and bold
experimentation in both its aural design and highly stylized visual live shows
that have resisted the test of time, the band has rightfully earned its place
standing tall among the giants of rock. As such, a show such as &quot;Brain
Damage&quot; is nothing short of a gold mine.

The Doctor elaborated on the origins of the show.

&quot;The whole thing came about when I was doing a cool rock radio show
playing kick-ass tunes at Tufts
 University's radio
station, WMFO,&quot; he said. &quot;From time to time, I'd do an occasional
Floyd feature. Eventually a few listeners and a good friend kept nagging me to
do a regular Floyd show.&quot;

FOB, left of center, inside the stacks.<span>&nbsp; </span>The last half of the first set is my favorite
except for when a member of the audience loses his mind after watching the
video of <span style="font-style: italic;">Leaving Beirut</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>His
screaming of &quot;What about 9-11!&quot; at the end of <i>Leaving
Beirut</i>, continues on through the beginning of <i>Sheep</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Besides that annoying
asshole, there is hardly any talking and the 360 degree sound imaging can be
heard. This is an excellent recording for the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Tweeter</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>This podcast starts off with one forgotten intro

<p class="MsoNormal">Since the<span style="font-style: italic;"> &quot;<a href="http://braindamage.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=103844">Covers</a></span>&quot; podcast, I've had many people ask about <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153); text-decoration: none;">Phish</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">'s</span>
performance of <i>Dark Side of the Moon.<span>&nbsp;
</span></i><span>So I decided to whip up a

on 2. November, <span style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153); text-decoration: none;">1998</span>.&nbsp; <span>Maybe we should call these special, shorter podcasts of <i>Brain

<p class="MsoNormal">Here's the story of how it all came about from <a href="http://www.phish.com/tmiph/index.php?year=1998&month=11" style="color: rgb(102, 204, 204);">Phish.com</a>. <br/></p>







<div style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;Over the years, the band has been known to play particularly
exceptional shows in order to make otherwise under-attended or
remotely-situated gigs more unique. On November 2nd at the E Center in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Salt</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Lake</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
they decided to keep the Halloween &quot;musical costume&quot; tradition alive
for another show - that afternoon, the band requested a copy of Pink Floyd's
Dark Side of The Moon CD. Backstage in their practice room, they began to learn
the recording, note-for-note. The show began and the first set was full of
energy and well-played. Trey was especially talkative with the crowd, and
thanked some of the participants from the Dead Goat Saloon. Set two opened with
Down With Disease which was followed by The Mango Song, a tune that had been
played rarely in recent years. You Enjoy Myself followed and segued into an
even more uncommon Harpua. The narration section consisted of a story told by
Trey about the main character in the song, Jimmy, and his cat Poster Nutbag,
and their journey through the desert to a sold-out show in the hectic city of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Las Vegas</st1:place></st1:city>. Trey
referenced the band's first performance in <st1:city w:st="on">Las Vegas</st1:city>
(December 6, 1996) which had also featured the song Harpua, that time with a
guest appearance by yodelers and multiple Elvi, and continued with Jimmy
getting a ride to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Salt Lake City</st1:place></st1:city>.
According to the narrative, the driver of Jimmy's godsend car was listening to <i>Dark Side of The Moon </i>at which point
Phish front-of-house engineer Paul Languedoc began the taped effects that kick
off the Pink Floyd CD and the band proceeded to perform the album (which they
had learned earlier in the day) in its entirety. Having taken the audience on a
most unexpected journey...&quot;</div>

There's no talking in the podcast except for the beginning.&nbsp; The reason being?&nbsp; Well, there're no words
that can adequately express or describe the sadness I feel.&nbsp; I just can't find the words to say about the passing
of &quot;Syd&quot;.&nbsp; He gave the world Pink Floyd and he's perhaps one of the most influential individules in pop culture.&nbsp; Roger &quot;Syd&quot; Barrett is truly an icon and he lives forever through the music he gave and inspired.<br/><p class="MsoNormal">Thank you Roger!<br/></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Originally Show #19, Air date: 7. August, 2004  - The Boston
Garden was a great place to see a concert.&nbsp; It was built at the cost of 4
million dollars in 1928 by the same people who built <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:state><st1:state><st1:state>New

Today, everything in the photo to the right, is gone.<br/>
<br/>
The Floyd live at The Garden, 18. June, 1975.&nbsp; Most enjoyable are the
performances of <i>You Gotta Be Crazy</i>, which is different from both the 74
and 77 <i>Dogs</i> versions.&nbsp; The set also has very good versions of <i>Any
Colour You Like</i> and one of the last pre-87 performances of <i>Echoes</i>.</p>

ten days ago.&nbsp; The concert was absolutely mesmerizing. <br/>I was
fairly close to the band, nine rows back.&nbsp; It was GREAT, however while
people up front had the better view, anyone towards the back of the venue had
the better sound.&nbsp; This recording was done by Dan Lynch from the rear,
left side of the venue.&nbsp; In less than 24 hours after the show, he had the
concert available on various trading groups on the Internet.<span><br/></span>I raise my beer glass to you Dan.&nbsp; <br/></p>











The sound is excellent!&nbsp; I did however run
it through a cool device to bring it out more.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So if you have a good sound system or headphones... just close your eyes
and you are there.&nbsp; <br/><br/>David was amazing and Rick was incredible.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sucked that Nick
wasn't there and Roger for that matter, but I kept thinking, &quot;This is
at least half of Pink Floyd, or 2/3 of post-Waters Floyd.&quot;&nbsp; Not bad

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Show #55, Release date: 14. April, 2006David Gilmour opened his North American On An Island
tour at New York City's
world famous Radio
 City
 Music Hall
ten days ago.&nbsp; The concert was absolutely mesmerizing. I was
fairly close to the band, nine rows back.&nbsp; It was GREAT, however while
people up front had the better view, anyone towards the back of the venue had
the better sound.&nbsp; This recording was done by Dan Lynch from the rear,
left side of the venue.&nbsp; In less than 24 hours after the show, he had the
concert available on various trading groups on the Internet.I raise my beer glass to you Dan.&nbsp; 











The sound is excellent!&nbsp; I did however run
it through a cool device to bring it out more.&nbsp;
So if you have a good sound system or headphones... just close your eyes
and you are there.&nbsp; David was amazing and Rick was incredible.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sucked that Nick
wasn't there and Roger for that matter, but I kept thinking, &quot;This is
at least half of Pink Floyd, or 2/3 of post-Waters Floyd.&quot;&nbsp; Not bad
considering it's the closest thing you'll get.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set 11.&nbsp; Castellorizon2.&nbsp; This Heaven3.&nbsp; Smile4.&nbsp; Red Sky at Night5.&nbsp; Take a Breath6.&nbsp; Then I Close My Eyes7.&nbsp; On An Island*8.&nbsp; The Blue*9.&nbsp; A Pocketful of Stones10.&nbsp; Where We StartSet 211.&nbsp; Shine on You Crazy Diamond*12.&nbsp; Wearing the Inside Out13.&nbsp; Dominoes14.&nbsp; Fat Old Sun15.&nbsp; Breathe16.&nbsp; Time17.&nbsp; Breathe (reprise)18.&nbsp; High Hopes19.&nbsp; Echoes

<i>In the Flesh</i> concert #61, at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, 6. July 1977, during which the famous spitting incident occurred.  This was the concert that broke the camel's back with obnoxious, large stadium crowds which intern inspired Roger's idea for building <i>The Wall</i>.<br/>
<br/>
This was the last show of the tour and the last time <i>Animals</i> would be performed live by the Floyd.  It was also the last time Roger would perform <i>Wish You Were Here</i> and <i>Money</i> with Pink Floyd until 28 years later for the famous Live8 reunion.<br/>
<br/> 
It's an audience recording from the floor section.  Sound quality is about a 3.75 on a scale of 1 to 5, (5 being the best) and runs 2hrs 35mins in its entirety, unedited.<br/>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Show #50, Release date: 3. February, 2006
Originally Show #1, Air date: 20. March, 2004

In the Flesh concert #61, at Montreal's Olympic Stadium, 6. July 1977, during which the famous spitting incident occurred.  This was the concert that broke the camel's back with obnoxious, large stadium crowds which intern inspired Roger's idea for building The Wall.

This was the last show of the tour and the last time Animals would be performed live by the Floyd.  It was also the last time Roger would perform Wish You Were Here and Money with Pink Floyd until 28 years later for the famous Live8 reunion.
 
It's an audience recording from the floor section.  Sound quality is about a 3.75 on a scale of 1 to 5, (5 being the best) and runs 2hrs 35mins in its entirety, unedited.

<br>
Yep... One ambitious, Fat Old Sun from Geelong, Australia asked me if he could have a go at making his own Brain Damage radio show for me to hear.  I said why not and two weeks later he sent it to me.  After listening to it, I feel it deserves some merit.  After all he throws in some good narration, has a decent selection of songs and even used a music bed to talk over, just like mine.  Fat Old Sun had no intention of this going public but I want to share it with you.  Brain Damage "up above" (the original) will be back on 7. January, 2006.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the surprise podcast and HAPPY NEW YEAR<br>

Aye an a bit o' mackerel, fiddler, rack and fear, And I rutted down by the hade and the furrow. Well, I slipped me in a flop and hit down and I shied, and I cried, cried, cried. The fear of fallin' down aft' taken, never back to rise and then cried Mary and I tucked up Wi' a Claymore out and about, and I run down, down the mechyn sty and back on fiery hore that was fallin' around the feet.  "Never!" I cried! "Never shall ye get me alive ya rotten hound of the Burnie Brae."  Well, I snapped for a blade and a Claymore cut and thrust and I fell down before him 'round his feet.

"Aye!" a roar he cried.  Frae the bottom of his heart that I would nay fall but dead, dead as a can by a feat deah... and the wind cried Mary, Thank you.*  

Sorry for the "slight" delay on this.  I ran into some issues during the mastering process.  No theme for this one.  I'm been so ridiculously busy with my studies I've had little time to squeeze a good one out... hahaha!!  Wait a second, that didn't sound right.  I mean, I didn't spend as much time on this, as I would have liked, but for a last minute effort, this podcast came out well.  Hope you like.

<br>
Originally<br>
Show #29, Air date: 11. March, 2005<br>
<br>
Electric Factory, Philadelphia, Pa, 26. September, 70 - If you close your eyes, you will feel as though you are there in the room.  The Electric Factory, in Philadelphia (as you can see on the photo) is not very big. You can hear peoples' coughs echo off the walls during the quiet moments, it's that small of a "room".<br>
<br>
The performance is excellent and there's a good amount of experimentation going on...
more than usual for a 1970 Floyd show (based on what I've heard so far). Every song is
played beautifully from start to finish.  Interstellar Overdrive was especially "interesting". 
A very spaced out show indeed.<br>
<br> 
Whoever taped this show, where ever you are... I LOVE YOU!!!!! <br>

<br>
Here is the rundown. <br>

2.	Crumbling Land (full mix) <br>
3.	High Hopes (pulse/meltdown)<br>
4.	Julia Dream (stereo version)<br>

Show #39, release date: 9. September, 2005<br>

Okay, you waited long enough, here it is, the first full podcast.  For now this will be a bi-weekly show.<br>

This one runs 121 minutes.  Now I have to say, this is very odd getting used to because it's so different than doing a live show on the air.  I need to sharpen the axe a little.<br>

Deep down I want to thank you for your infinite patience and willingness to wait almost four months for this to kick off.<br>
I hope it wont disappoint you.<br>
<br>
This show features only unique soundboard recordings, most of which are unreleased.<br> 
- A recording from Australia.  Tennis anyone?<br>
- Spooky sounds from Montreux your Mother
warned you about<br>
- Live8 comments from David Gilmour<br>
- An Italian two-fer<br>
- Three farm pigs running free in Berlin<br>
- and lots more<br>

            <description><![CDATA[<br/>This is one of the many hand painted banners that hung from the rafters of Earls Court during Pink Floyd's Division Bell shows back in 1994.  The purpose of the banners was to improve the sound and dampen the echoing effect of the acoustics of Earls Court.<br/>  
<br/>
They measure 20'x18' and you can see this banner and others in <i>P.U.L.S.E.</i> and Storm Thorgerson's hardcover book, <i>Mind Over Matter - Images of Pink Floyd</i> on page 194.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This is one of the many hand painted banners that hung from the rafters of Earls Court during Pink Floyd's Division Bell shows back in 1994.  The purpose of the banners was to improve the sound and dampen the echoing effect of the acoustics of Earls Court.  

They measure 20'x18' and you can see this banner and others in P.U.L.S.E. and Storm Thorgerson's hardcover book, Mind Over Matter - Images of Pink Floyd on page 194.
