    <description>GO ON! ASK US ANY QUESTION AND WE WILL GIVE THE WORLD'S BEST ANSWER!

When one indian soul meets another the world stops to listen to their chat. Eternal discussions include slang-peppered backstabbing! Political conspiracies are spun from the soiled cuffs! Economic crises, neighborhood scandals and paan-flavoured innuendos tumble out of the great indian consciousness!

Chitchat, the greatest boon of mankind, is an indian invention!

Listen to great, eternal, enlightened duo Brother Sue and Bothers You! Their gift is gab! Their talk is boundless! Their language is indiani, a local version of english!

They aptly put it in their typical indiani, &quot;Grass never grows beneath our feet, babu! And yet we gather no moss, swami!&quot;

&lt;b&gt;Our special Musical Episode #2. After encouragement from the listeners the enlightened duo decided to release another special indiani remix. This time it is the classic 'Under the boardwalk!'&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Here are the lyrics of this tuneful classic:&lt;/b&gt;

When the sun beats down
And burns the tar up on the roof
And your shoes get so hot
You wish your tired feet were fireproof

Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

From the park you'll hear
The happy sound of a carousel
You can almost taste the hot dogs
And french fries they sell

Under the boardwalk
Down by the sea, yeah
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be making love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

Oh, under the boardwalk
Down by the sea
On a blanket with my baby
Is where I'll be

(Under the boardwalk) Out of the sun
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be having some fun
(Under the boardwalk) People walking above
(Under the boardwalk) We'll be falling in love
(Under the boardwalk, boardwalk)

&lt;b&gt;Listen to our special musical episode of our take on a song by Eels. This song was in the soundtrack of Shrek 2. Here are the lyrics to this wonderful song:

I need some sleep,
You can't go on like this
I try counting  sheep
But there's one i always miss
Everyone says:&quot; i'm getting down too low&quot; 
Everyone says:&quot;you just gotta let it go&quot;
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
I need some sleep 
Time to put the old hore down
I 'm in too deep
And the wheels keep spining round
Everyone says:&quot;i'm getting down too low 
Everyone says:&quot; you just gotta let it go&quot;
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go&lt;/b&gt;
......end......
