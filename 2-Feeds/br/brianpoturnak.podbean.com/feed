<p><strong>Brian Poturnak Promotes Travel to the Philippines</strong></p>
<p>Brian Poturnak, successful businessman from the City of Makati, has recently launched an awareness campaign, aimed at promoting tourism and travel to the Philippines. The Canadian expatriate has lived there for 14 years and is encouraging others to consider the Southeastern Asian country as a vacation or business travel destination.</p>
<p>“The Philippines is a beautiful country and I want to let others know that it’s a great place to both visit and live,” said Brian Poturnak, father of three and successful entrepreneur.</p>
<p>“With over 7,100 islands, there are a lot of potential destinations that visitors can choose from. The country is not only an excellent tourist destination, but there are also unique business opportunities here as well,” Poturnak added.</p>
<p>Brian Poturnak noted that he is promoting his country of residence because it makes “good business sense” and wants to spur economic and tourist activity. Poturnak also wants others to experience the beauty of the islands.</p>
<p>With volcanic landscapes, vibrant coral waters, beautiful mountains and an emerging economic system, the Philippines has something for everyone.</p>
<p>“I enjoy tennis, golf, jet skiing and hiking &#8212; all of which are readily available,” noted Brian Poturnak.</p>
<p>Much like other countries around the world, he said the Philippines were affected by the recent economic downturn. There are signs, however, that the worst may be over.</p>
<p>“Recent reports suggest that things are bottoming out and are showing signs of an economic recovery. The future looks very bright here,” Porturnak said.</p>

Brian Poturnak Promotes Travel to the Philippines

Brian Poturnak, successful businessman from the City of Makati, has recently launched an awareness campaign, aimed at promoting tourism and travel to the Philippines. The Canadian expatriate has lived there for 14 years and is encouraging others to consider the Southeastern Asian country as a vacation or business travel destination.

“The Philippines is a beautiful country and I want to let others know that it’s a great place to both visit and live,” said Brian Poturnak, father of three and successful entrepreneur.

“With over 7,100 islands, there are a lot of potential destinations that visitors can choose from. The country is not only an excellent tourist destination, but there are also unique business opportunities here as well,” Poturnak added.

Brian Poturnak noted that he is promoting his country of residence because it makes “good business sense” and wants to spur economic and tourist activity. Poturnak also wants others to experience the beauty of the islands.

With volcanic landscapes, vibrant coral waters, beautiful mountains and an emerging economic system, the Philippines has something for everyone.

“I enjoy tennis, golf, jet skiing and hiking -- all of which are readily available,” noted Brian Poturnak.

Much like other countries around the world, he said the Philippines were affected by the recent economic downturn. There are signs, however, that the worst may be over.

“Recent reports suggest that things are bottoming out and are showing signs of an economic recovery. The future looks very bright here,” Porturnak said.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Brian Poturnak Makes Transition from Pacific Northwest to the Far East</strong></p>
<p>Brian Poturnak, successful businessman and Canadian expatriate, has recently explained his transition from growing up in the Pacific Northwest to settling down with his family in the national capital of the Philippines. <a>Brian Poturnak</a> is sharing his trials and tribulations in an effort to encourage others who may be struggling with adapting to their new environments.</p>
<p>“Initially, the transition from Canada to the Philippines was a bit difficult,” admits Brian Poturnak, father of three and a successful area businessman.</p>
<p>“However, my family was very supportive and that made the process much easier,” Poturnak adds.</p>
<p>Born and raised in the Province of British Columbia in Canada, Brian Poturnak never thought he would leave the comfort of Vancouver, which has consistently been ranked as one of the most livable cities in the world. However, circumstance and opportunity necessitated the international move, which ultimately landed him on the islands of the Philippines.</p>
<p>For many expats, relocation is a difficult undertaking, usually prompted by a job or family-related matter. Many times, there is an initial reluctance to settle down in an unfamiliar environment. Adaptability is the biggest challenge to overcome and Brian Poturnak recommends finding other individuals who share the same interests, hobbies and activities.</p>
<p>“I love to play golf and tennis,” notes Brian Poturnak. “Finding others who enjoyed these same activities helped a great deal in getting adjusted to my new environment.”</p>
<p>If possible, Poturnak also recommends networking through organizations or clubs. He also advises others to consider expat networking groups which give the ability to connect with others who are from the same native country.</p>
<p>“If I had to do it all over again, I would,” explains Brian Poturnak.</p>
<p>“Living abroad can bring challenges but is also a very rewarding experience,” he concludes.</p>
