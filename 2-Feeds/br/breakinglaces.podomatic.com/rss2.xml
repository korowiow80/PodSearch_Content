      <title>The Dirty Birdy EP </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1484728/600x600_4392852.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We recorded quite a catalog in recent years.  Listen this unreleased EP recorded in 2007... features &quot;Donkey Punch Gone Wrong&quot; and other tunes (Note... as the name suggests, the other song titles are a little too Dirty Birdy for Facebook, so if you are old enough... tune in online)!

The Breaking Laces Officially Awesome Podcast series will bring you inside the band's circle. You will hear their creative storytelling about life, music and robots. In a few short years, the Brooklyn trio known as Breaking Laces has quietly built a potent body of recorded work and carved out a formidable reputation as a powerful live act. In the process, they've amassed a large and fiercely devoted grass-roots fan base that's been solidified by the group's tireless roadwork. These achievements are all the more impressive in light of the fact that they've been accomplished on the band's own terms, with an absence of outside hype and an old-school emphasis on honest musicianship and irresistibly melodic, emotionally engaging songwriting. www.breakinglaces.com</description>

      <itunes:summary>From Nashville to NYC, we recorded quite a catalog in recent years.  Listen to four live songs from NYC in 2006. Includes &quot;Shack Up SOS&quot; and &quot;Call You Home&quot; from the album Lemonade. Also included &quot;Megan&quot; and &quot;Geek in Love&quot; from the album Sohcahtoa.

The Breaking Laces Officially Awesome Podcast series will bring you inside the band's circle. You will hear their creative storytelling about life, music and robots. In a few short years, the Brooklyn trio known as Breaking Laces has quietly built a potent body of recorded work and carved out a formidable reputation as a powerful live act. In the process, they've amassed a large and fiercely devoted grass-roots fan base that's been solidified by the group's tireless roadwork. These achievements are all the more impressive in light of the fact that they've been accomplished on the band's own terms, with an absence of outside hype and an old-school emphasis on honest musicianship and irresistibly melodic, emotionally engaging songwriting. www.breakinglaces.com</itunes:summary>
