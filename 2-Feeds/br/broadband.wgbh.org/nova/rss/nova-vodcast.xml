<item><title>(refeed) NOVA Short | Soccer-Playing Robots</title><description>They shuffle around, find the ball, plan their next move, and, of course, kick—all on their own. Designed by Manuela Veloso, a computer scientist at Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute and her team, these soccer-playing robots stand at the forefront of machines that can learn about the world and act appropriately. They can sense their surroundings and respond to changing conditions, like the arrival of another player in the vicinity. The long-term goal of Veloso's and other AI labs? To win the World Cup against humans by 2050. But they've got a few bugs to work out of their 'bots—like keeping them upright.

For more, watch "The Smartest Machine on Earth" on Wednesday, May 2, 2012 at 9pm on PBS, or online at pbs.org/nova.

<item><title>NSN Short | Snail Slime</title><description>What do you get when you cross the world's most famous slowpoke with some of MIT's latest high-tech robotics?

Robotics engineers at MIT are looking at snails for inspiration. Nature's famous slowpokes produce a "yield-stress fluid," better known as slime, that has remarkable properties. It can behave both as a solid glue and as a slippery lubricant. A slime-like synthetic substance could one day help tiny robots explore the human body and aid high-tech medicine.
