<item><title>In Defense of Pluto</title><description>After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it enjoyed the title of planet for more than 75 years. But in 2006, that all changed. At a meeting in Prague, the International Astronomical Union adopted a new definition for planethood, leaving the solar system with only eight planets. But not everyone agrees with its decision. In this podcast, planetary scientist Alan Stern talks to us about Pluto’s demotion, and why he thinks it should be back on list of planets.

<item><title>Shaping Skulls</title><description>For thousands of years, people around the world have modified their bodies with tattoos and piercings. But some cultures, like the ancient Inca in Peru, took that practice beyond skin deep. They sometimes used ropes and boards to slowly change the shape of human skulls. It’s a process called "cranial modification" In this podcast, bioarcheologist Valerie Andrushko explains.

<item><title>A Clean Energy Future?</title><description>Steven Chu is the U.S. Secretary of Energy under President Obama. He’s a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, and a big proponent of renewable power, like wind and solar. He says that although they’re essential to fight climate change, that’s only one reason we should adopt them in the United States. Another reason is purely economic—there’s a lot of money to be made in the clean energy market.

<item><title>Toward a Smart Electric Grid</title><description>On August 14, 2003, the biggest blackout in American history struck the Northeast U.S. and parts of Canada. 50 million people lost power, and the blackout showed how vulnerable and even outdated our electricity system is. To fix that problem, some energy experts think it's time to upgrade to a "smart grid," one that uses digital technology to regulate itself. Vijay Vaitheeswaran is energy correspondent for The Economist magazine. In this interview, he explains why we need to take the power grid into the 21st century.

<item><title>The Risks of Automated Flight</title><description>Most passenger jets today fly under computer control, at least to some extent. Usually, those computers make flying safer. But like any machine, they can sometimes break down, leading, in rare cases, to major accidents. In this interview, aviation expert Bill Voss explains why he thinks airlines should put more emphasis on solving computer automation problems during pilot training.

But was there anything to the idea? To find out, we talked to NOVA's senior science editor, Evan Hadingham. He trained as an archeologist and has written two books on Stonehenge.

<item><title>The Origin of Dogs</title><description>New DNA evidence shows that dogs were probably domesticated from wolves in the Middle East about eight thousand years ago.  But wolves are generally fierce animals that travel in packs, and they’re usually afraid of humans. That's pretty far off from the behavior of today's family pets. So how could that poodle in your backyard have come from a wolf? To find out, we spoke to Clive Wynne, who studies animal behavior at the University of Florida.

<item><title>NASA's Forgotten Tapes</title><description>In the mid 1960s, NASA launched the first of five lunar orbiters. Each one transmitted hundreds of images of the moon's surface back to Earth, which NASA recorded onto miles of analog tape. It was state of the art technology for the 1960s. But today, it's mostly forgotten. For the last 40 years, the tapes from the Lunar Orbiter missions have collected dust in a warehouse, and the computer drives that could read them have gone the way of the dinosaurs. In this podcast, we talked to Dennis Wingo, an engineer who's working to recover the images from the now-obsolete tapes.

But he's not after sunken treasure--he's after information. Foley is a marine archeologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He's taking a new approach to the field. Instead of just focusing on a handful of shipwrecks, he wants to take a broad look, finding and cataloging wrecks  in the Mediterranean that date to a wide timeframe.

<item><title>Stuck on Mars</title><description>NASA's twin rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, have been exploring the surface of Mars for more than six years. It's an impressive fact, considering they were only designed to last for three months. But despite this longevity, recent mechanical failures have brought the Spirit rover to a standstill. In this podcast, we talked to Bruce Banerdt, the Project Scientist for the Mars rover missions, about the fate of this now-stationary rover.

<item><title>The Littlest Planet</title><description>In 2006, the International Astronomical Union decided on new definition of a planet--and Pluto didn't make the grade. It was bumped down to "dwarf planet" status.  But it's not alone. It's now one of five known dwarf planets in the solar system. One of them, called Ceres, may hold clues to how life formed on Earth. In this podcast, we talked to planetary scientist Mark Sykes about this tiny world.

<item><title>In Defense of Pluto</title><description>After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it enjoyed the title of planet for more than 75 years. But in 2006, that all changed. At a meeting in Prague, the International Astronomical Union adopted a new definition for planethood, leaving the solar system with only eight planets. But not everyone agrees with its decision. In this podcast, planetary scientist Alan Stern talks to us about Pluto's demotion, and why he thinks it should be back on list of planets.

<item><title>Diving Into Danger</title><description>Scientists are excited about the Bahamas, and it's not just the tropical vacations that have their interest. It's what's underneath the surface of the islands—huge caves systems filled with water. They're called blue holes, and deep inside of them lie clues to past climate change, new species of invertebrates, even human remains from people who lived on the islands long before Columbus visited. In this podcast, hear from Kenny Broad, a researcher who led a diving expedition into blue holes last year.
