<item><title>Archeology in the Deep</title><description>Brenden Foley hunts ancient shipwrecks for a living. But he’s not after sunken treasure--he’s after information. Foley is a marine archeologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He’s taking a new approach to the field. Instead of just focusing on a handful of shipwrecks, he wants to take a broad look, finding and cataloging wrecks in the Mediterranean that date to a wide timeframe. In this podcast, he talks to us about his work.

	<item><title>Life in the Blast Zone</title><description>Ecologist Charlie Crisafulli describes how the ecosystem around Mt. St. Helens is rebuilding itself 30 years after the catastrophic eruption.

Thirty years ago, a violent eruption ripped through the side of Mt. St. Helens in western Oregon. The blast killed 57 people and countless animals, and turned hundreds of miles of forest into barren wasteland. In this podcast, hear from ecologist Charlie Crisafulli on the slow recovery of the Mt. St. Helens ecosystem, and learn how the timing of the eruption actually spared some plant and animal life.

In this podcast, Richardson reflects on the clash of cultures between Pocahontas's people and the English settlers of Jamestown.

To find out, we visited the training center for Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station. Pilgrim is on the Atlantic coast near Plymouth, Massachussets, about an hour's drive south of Boston. It's one of 23 nuclear plants in the U.S. that use the same nuclear reactor design as the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan.

If Dean Alhorn has his way, they'll be powered by light. Alhorn is an engineer at NASA's Marshall Space Flight center. He designs solar sails. They're basically big silver kites in space that are pushed along by the sun's rays. And Alhorn says they might change spaceflight in the very near future.

<item><title>NASA's Forgotten Tapes</title><description>In the mid 1960s, NASA launched the first of five lunar orbiters. Each one transmitted hundreds of images of the moon's surface back to Earth, which NASA recorded onto miles of analog tape. It was state of the art technology for the 1960s. But today, it's mostly forgotten. For the last 40 years, the tapes from the Lunar Orbiter missions have collected dust in a warehouse, and the computer drives that could read them have gone the way of the dinosaurs. In this podcast, we talked to Dennis Wingo, an engineer who's working to recover the images from the now-obsolete tapes.

It was bumped down to "dwarf planet" status. But it's not alone. It's now one of five known dwarf planets in the solar system. One of them, called Ceres, may hold clues to how life formed on Earth. In this podcast, we talked to planetary scientist Mark Sykes about this tiny world.

<item><title>In Defense of Pluto</title><description>After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it enjoyed the title of planet for more than 75 years. But in 2006, that all changed. At a meeting in Prague, the International Astronomical Union adopted a new definition for planethood, leaving the solar system with only eight planets. But not everyone agrees with its decision. In this podcast, planetary scientist Alan Stern talks to us about Pluto's demotion, and why he thinks it should be back on list of planets.

It's what's underneath the surface of the islands&#8212;huge caves systems filled with water.
