<itunes:subtitle>If you have no content, then what are you talking about on social media?</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>In today's podcast, we are joined by Jay Baer. Jay is a social media strategist, author, speaker and President of Convince &amp; Convert. Jay shares incredible insights into how brands and companies can and should be embracing content marketing.  Jay offers practical advice into developing great content and shares why it really comes before social in many cases. Otherwise, you are just talking about yourself! This really ties into to what Jay shared on the latest episode of his own Social Pros podcast.  During the show, Jay also made the bold statement that Google needs to be your most important customer when it comes to content creation. If you are not find-able/searchable, why create the content?  At the end of the day, Jay shares, content marketing and social media are not inexpensive because they are highly labor intensive, but we must find time for them because they are critical for growing your business.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>"The New Price of Doing Well is Doing Good"</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>We recently spoke with David Jones, the Global CEO of Havas (and EuroRSCG). We discuss David's recently published book, Who Cares Wins.  David shares why corporate social responsibility must be at the core of business strategy. In this "age of damage," says David, "companies can't hide."  This is a paradigm shift; consumers are beginning to demand that businesses become more socially responsible. This goes beyond companies simple being responsible in terms of sustainable practices; it extends into companies actually giving back as well.  Moreover, David argues that social media "has taken corporate responsibility out of the silo and into the P&amp;L." David is on the forefront of a global movement and every brands needs to take a listen to what he is saying. Tune in here and pop over to Amazon to buy his must-read book.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>'Everybody has a voice' - Mark Schaefer's Return on Influence</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>We've all heard the word influencers, but they seem to be coming together in what is being called influencer marketing platforms. It's a new category and some brands are looking at it as though it's a new category of media.  Recently, this has become a much debated topic, particularly as it relates to services like Klout, Peer Index, Kred and others. What does the evolution of influence really mean?  Who are these citizen influencers and how can brands connect with them?  In today's episode, we reached out to Mark Schaefer. Many of you know Mark from his incredible work with the top ranked {Grow} community blog, but he is also a globally-recognized business writer, university lecturer, and the author of the best-selling books The Tao of Twitter and Return on Influence.  In today's podcast, we discuss the new ROI (return on influence) and what that really means for brands. You don't want to miss it.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>Marketing in the Round</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> For those of you that don't know Gini Dietrich, you need to make her acquaintance. First, she's one of the nicest people I know and second she is a blogging and content marketing rock star. You may recall Gini's appearance on Brand Fast-Trackers last year, when she made the bold statement that soon, social media will be everyone's job (if it's not already), meaning that social is not going away and brands need to be actively engaging their customers. Gini has a new book out called Marketing in the Round that she co-authored with Geoff Livingston. Geoff is a marketing strategist, fundraiser and the VP of Strategic Partnerships at Razoo, a fantastic organization we will talk more about next week. Marketing in the Round is all about breaking down the organizational silos that exist on both the brand and agency side and how to market in an open, communicative and ultimately more successful business model. There are many books on social media, but this is a honest to good marketing book. Gini and Geoff clearly explain the pros and cons of every single marketing strategy, including social. They guide us through breaking down communication barriers between departments and forming a truly integrated marketing program on multiple levels. For a great review of the book, skip on over to Inkling Media and read Ken's review, posted today. Tune into our interview with Gini and Geoff to learn more and don't forget to buy the book!</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>How Stories can Save the World </itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary> Storytelling is one of the most vigorous tools we have to influence, educate and share, but both for- and non-profit brands struggle with it.  To successfully market your brand, you actively need to think about storytelling and be constantly aware of its importance.  Today we are speaking with Dan Portnoy, the author of The Nonprofit Narrative: How Stories Can Save the World. Dan shares his insights and explains the difference between sharing facts and telling stories.  He also describes the importance of knowing how to create your own story, which parts of it you should tell, and ultimately how to tell it. The best way of getting attention is, according to Dan, connecting emotions to your story. Emotions comes first, attention comes after.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>Why Social Media is a Digital Team Sport</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>Big brands have traditionally turned to agencies for social media and emerging technology expertise. Nowadays, they are bringing developing centers of excellence inside their organizations. In today's episode, we are joined by Adam Kmiec, the Social Media Director at Walgreens. Adam shares his views on social media, and how organizations should relate to it. According to Adam, social media is by definition a team sport. It requires good collaboration, not just within the organization, but also with agency and technology partners. He says organizations need to consider social media as a way of doing business and connecting with consumers, and not as an individual, vertical department. Adam concludes that social media is not only about wall posts, tweets and videos uploaded on YouTube; it is a catalyst for interactivity and engagement between the consumer and the product.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>The Power of Sharing - Thoughts from the creator of the fastest-growing Facebook app of all time!</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>A top goal for most brands, aside from sales, is building and maintaining top-of-mind awareness with their consumers. The best way to "get into your customer's mind" is of course through stories. People can relate to stories, and if those stories relate or signal back to your brand, it is a big, and long-term payoff.  We speak with an early adopter in this new marketing discipline, Jason Zada. Jason is the genius behind Take This Lollipop, the fastest growing Facebook App of all time, with over 13MM likes to date. Take This Lollipop is a social experiment on storytelling and just won Best in Show and the Experimental category at SXSW's interactive awards. Thousands of years ago, stories were passed down from one generation to a next. Today, the level of sharing has dramatically shifted. In today's episode, we get the chance delve into Jason's view of sharing, and also hear his thoughts of being an entrepreneur, following your dreams and reinventing yourself.</itunes:summary>

Historically, a business would see a 30% purchase conversion rate and be pleased with results, but Jonathan points out that what that really means is that 70% of your customers are walking into your store and NOT buying. He discusses how business can improve the customer experience by soliciting feedback from them and measuring it while the customer is in location (in store, website, etc) and use this to make a real impact on sales.  If you are either a business owner or a brand marketer, you need to hear Jonathan's insights.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>There is tremendous data to suggest that social media has fundamentally changed the way we live and communicate.  We send out 35MM tweets per day and spend 700B minutes on Facebook per month - really astonishing statistics when you think about it.  There is no way that usage could not alter how we are communicating and therefore living.  In this podcast, we speak with David Epstein and Steven Revare, authors of Social Butterflies. The process they used to write the book was to speak with the social media mavens who are really shaping how consumers use these mediums. Though the book is not written for brands, we were very curious to ask David and Steven how consumers are reacting to the degree to which brands are utilizing the social media space. I think you will be surprised on what they say.</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>In this podcast Eric presents the important steps in transitioning from an employee to the head of your own company, and the mindset to do it. To launch Method, one of the fastest growing and most innovative companies to date, Eric looked to fill in the gaps of a large market (detergent), in order to meet a consumer need or desire that would otherwise be missed. He inspires all to find that empty space in a market and produce a well-targeted innovative product. Eric makes soap. Really nice smelling soap that's non-toxic and good for the planet. Soap that's really beautiful, too, that makes people want to clean. In 2001, Eric and his high school buddy Adam started Method, from their personal savings and $100 in cash as capital, Eric and Adam started innovating chic green products. They launched the first concentrated laundry detergent, ultimately transforming the $4 billion industry. Other milestones include biodiesel shipping, vegan fabric softener and bamboo wipes. Today, Method has over 100 planet friendly cleaning products that can be found in stores across America, Canada and the UK and has risen to a $100 million brand - a brand that was ranked the 7th fastest growing company in America by Inc. Magazine and as one of the most innovative companies in the world by Fast Company. He's been named an eco-leader by Vanity Fair, a Food &amp; Wine Tastemaker, an eco-revolutionary by Time Magazine, PETA's Person of the Year, and one of People Magazine's Sexiest People Alive. Okay, that last one's not really true, but the others are. Eric lives in Marin with his wife Ingrid and two children Anya and Matias.</itunes:summary>

<itunes:subtitle>For a brand marketer, this is the most powerful tool - rarely used.</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>A brand marketer has one primary job - to influence us. Their marketing strategy is to influence our brain so that we associate some of our most desired feelings and wants to their brand.  How do they do this? Well typically they utilize our sense of sight and hearing within their branding strategies. Think about it. A print ad utilizes, sight, radio and hearing. A television commercial utilizes both.  Question for you, how many print ads do you remember from this past week? TV spots?  Here's another question, ever walk through a mall past Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and notice a unique scent in the air?  Perhaps you have been onboard Singapore Airlines you are struck by how clean it smells?  Cinnabon? Does that smell not make you crave that most unhealthy breakfast on planet earth?  Well that's because our sense of smell is controlled through our olfactory system which is the strongest sense linked to memory. And in the end, marketers are trying to get their brand into our long term memory storage, while associating pleasure to that emotion. Master marketers and business branding experts know that one of the fastest, most powerful ways to do this is by leveraging our sense of smell.   Now obviously categories such as beauty, fragrance, food, beverages, beer wine, liquor all have this as a critical element of their product design - but do they leverage and execute it in their marketing plan? Do they allow you to experience the smell and use it to influence us?  Further, how can other categories like travel, auto, even credit cards use these branding strategies to their advantage?  </itunes:summary>

	<itunes:summary>If you work in a job that you don't LOVE and have PASSION for - the kind of passion that makes you wake up early and stay up late - If you work in a job where you don't make ANYWHERE near what you are worth - If you work in a job, or even if you have a career, and want to do more, create more, make more, give more, do it better, win more frequently, call your own shots, be free, make the world a better place, leave a legacy, meet new people, set out on an adventure or create certainty for yourself and those you care about - Then you may want to read a few more lines.  If that's what you want, you can have it.  You can start part- time. You don't have to quit your job.  Just knowing that you can start part time will open your eyes to opportunities that were always there...but that you simply never saw.  By doing this you will find your idea.  And then you will work.  You will get home from your job at 6PM and work until 10 PM, and every other weekend.  Then you can begin building your business and quit when it's big enough.  Then, once you quit, and focus 100% of your time, passion and attention on that one purpose, amazing things will happen.  You will build it, it will grow, and you will (if you so desire) sell it for millions and be able to share that fortune with those who helped you get there!  At least that's what our guest on this podcast did.  And you can too!  Because SUCCESS LEAVES CLUES.</itunes:summary>

And then you will work.  You will get home from your job at 6PM and work until 10 PM, and every other weekend.  Then you can begin building your business and quit when it's big enough.  Then, once you quit, and focus 100% of your time, passion and attention on that one purpose, amazing things will happen.  You will build it, it will grow, and you will (if you so desire) sell it for millions and be able to share that fortune with those who helped you get there!  At least that's what our guest on this podcast did.  And you can too!  Because SUCCESS LEAVES CLUES.</description>

	<itunes:summary>Clayton Christopher sold medical supplies, but had always wanted to have his own business. So while he had his day to day job, he kept his eyes open, knew he could start his own venture part time. In doing so he found an unexploited niche in a BIG category.  Even though Clayton had no prior experience in the beverage industry, he started Sweet Leaf Tea Co and worked to fill a very obvious hole within the bottle tea category.He selected a few key points of difference:  1) His product would be premium in nature, created with only the best of ingredients.  2) He would build his brand in an authentic way, without traditional advertising.  Fast forward 10 years to 2009 and Clayton has gone from selling medical supplies, to selling a multinational conglomerate like Nestle Waters on the idea of investing in his and his teams well guarded brand...which he just did this past month!  For anyone who is working on a brand or in an agency and has a desire to one day start their own business, Clayton did it...and as always...success leaves clues!</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>A marketing strategy lesson from 1-800-Flowers.com on Mothers Day</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>This brand has the RIGHT to use social media! And is doing it the RIGHT way!  As you are planning for 2010, no doubt every brand strategy out there includes 'exploring' how they can use 'social media'.  At least every brand we work with is.  And for good reason.  If you are, then this podcast is for you.  As 1-800 Flowers was kind enough to post a few guideposts with us...questions they ask themselves to keep the program on track.  A VERY practical lesson for all brands.  1) Is there a LOGICAL link between the brand and the overall concept?  2) Did we create a VIRTUAL VENUE for them to visit to learn more?  3) Did we recruit someone from within the target audience who is an AUTHORITY?  4) Did we give that authority figure some CURRENCY to use?  5) Are we using social media tools that make it EASY for others to share?  Where some brands are struggling is that they are jumping right to #5!  Lets put up a Facebook fan page, a corporate blog and 'TWEET' out some promotional messages and there you go.  This gets you fans (all of which are from your agency) and 10 followers (also from your agency)  Some good, practical, applicable learning for any brand.  Happy Mothers Day!</itunes:summary>

	<itunes:subtitle>Marketing BIG BRANDS online - 101 Lessons from someone DOING it, not TALKING about it.</itunes:subtitle>
	<itunes:summary>In just ten years, internet branding and online advertising has surpassed magazine advertising in terms of total dollars invested by brands.  During that time, there have been lots of people talking about how national brands should be using the web. Basically, a lot of opinions.  Ironically, most of these people have never worked for a big marketer, nor have they ever marketed a national brand.  Today, you'll get an opportunity to hear from someone who has been doing it since the beginning - and his track record suggests that he knows what he is doing!  Seth Greenberg is the Director of Online Advertising and Internet Media for Intuit, marketers of brands like Quicken and Turbo Tax.  On a side note, notice his title...more and more companies are dedicating headcount solely to focus on directing the brand's online marketing and branding investment.  In addition to sharing with us how he sold in Vanilla Ice as the spokesperson for an online tax product, (that in and of itself should tell you that he's a good marketer :) ), you will get an insider's look as to what it's like to be responsible for a major online investment.</itunes:summary>
