 <description>The (douche)Blast from the Past - Despite our best instincts we decide to take a trip down memory lane this week as we revisit the very first show we ever put together. We&#039;re not going to lie it&#039;s a bit of a horror show but it was important for us to demonstrate exactly how much we have changed over the years.

 <link>http://bracknell4show.jellycast.com/node/93</link>
 <description>Rejoice! The show is back! Don&#039;t fret any longer because we&#039;re back in all our glory...well...I say glory...back with a bit of shambolic offering if we&#039;re honest. We are at least back though so that&#039;s one thing. If you can suffer all of the early tripe it&#039;s worth sticking around for the end where we substitute the name Moore into popular TV and film titles...doesn&#039;t sound much but it&#039;s good. If you have any thoughts or opinions you would like to share with us please email craig.podcast@hotmail.com. Thanks x.</description>
