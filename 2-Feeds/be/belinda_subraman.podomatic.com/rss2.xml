      <title>Lucid Play with Yogini, Author, Teacher, Artist, Tantra Bensko</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17764/600x600_5076567.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tantra Bensko plays toward Lucidity in many ways, and has presented some methods and results through formats such as her writing, in a genre she calls Lucid Fiction. She has traveled across the country for decades doing healings, which she learned to do at a distance at 12. Her music, art, acting, Tantra Yoga teaching, and hypnosis combine play, spontaneous movement and sound, writing without pre-composition, and also expansion of the self, as well as a kind of feral wildness, and absurdist humor.

Two new books are recently out, The Cabinet of What You Don't See (ISMs Press) and Lucid Fiction (Night Publishing.) http://lucidmembrane.weebly.com/ Lucid Membrane addresses all levels of the self, from zany realism to explosively meditative. Three stories are hidden within it, one of which speaks directly to the subconscious to nudge it to become more Lucid, able to see truth, through manipulation, and illusion. Readers can put the password found in the book into the website's Secret Womb, and find even more of the book, in new, participatory forms.</description>

      <title>Peggy Kelsy and Her Afghan Women's Project</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17764/600x600_3593034.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peggy was inspired to begin the Afghan Women&#8217;s Project after meeting with a delegation of Afghan women who passed through Austin, Texas during the fall of 2002. The strength, humor and resiliency of these women was contrary to the media image of Afghan women as helpless victims. It inspired Peggy to create The Afghan Women&#8217;s Project in order to share this side of Afghan women with western audiences. This project&#8217;s goal, seeking out wisdom and sources of strength from women who have experienced such repression and hardship, is one of the ways Peggy can merge her love of photography with her interest in human psychology as well as concretely benefit both Afghan women and the viewers.

Peggy traveled to Afghanistan in August and September of 2003, returning with photographs and interviews of 40 women.

      <itunes:summary>Peggy was inspired to begin the Afghan Women&#8217;s Project after meeting with a delegation of Afghan women who passed through Austin, Texas during the fall of 2002. The strength, humor and resiliency of these women was contrary to the media image of Afghan women as helpless victims. It inspired Peggy to create The Afghan Women&#8217;s Project in order to share this side of Afghan women with western audiences. This project&#8217;s goal, seeking out wisdom and sources of strength from women who have experienced such repression and hardship, is one of the ways Peggy can merge her love of photography with her interest in human psychology as well as concretely benefit both Afghan women and the viewers.

Peggy traveled to Afghanistan in August and September of 2003, returning with photographs and interviews of 40 women. They are of various ages and come from differing social classes, ethnic groups and areas of the country. Currently, 23 of the women form an exhibit that also includes their biographies and excerpts from their interviews.

Born in New York City, Mark has traveled the world gaining inspiration for his ideas from artist Andy Warhol, who Mark beneficially watched at work and knew for two years. Warhol encouraged and helped Schwartz cultivate his artistic renderings of shoes while Schwartz was working for Roger Vivier as an assistant designer and creative director. Mark Schwartz is now pioneering a new shade of talent within his work by exploring the grace and eclecticism of footwear as works of art.

Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett began his career in San Francisco writing music for commercials. He has eight released albums on Narada, Epic and Hollywood labels as well as six releases on his own label - including the EMMY 
award winning CD, Ojibwe.  

Buffett also composed and produced the score for the Duncan Group production of WISCONSIN &#8211; AN AMERICAN PORTRAIT, a regional EMMY award winner.

Buffett's theatrical production, Spirit &#8211; The Seventh Fire, originally launched as a successful PBS pledge event, was located on the National Mall for the Smithsonian's opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. As co-chairman of the NoVo Foundation, Buffett helps guide the strategic plan that he and his wife Jennifer will implement with a small dedicated staff over the coming years.

Buffett's theatrical production, Spirit &#8211; The Seventh Fire, originally launched as a successful PBS pledge event, was located on the National Mall for the Smithsonian's opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. As co-chairman of the NoVo Foundation, Buffett helps guide the strategic plan that he and his wife Jennifer will implement with a small dedicated staff over the coming years.

      <title>Tea With Dante: Poetry by Brian Michael Tracy, Music from Andy Hill, Renee Safier and Marty Rifkin</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17764/600x600_1050982.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian had been working on a book of poetry when he attended a Lucinda Williams concert where, between songs, her father Miller Williams read his poetry. Brian thought that Andy and Renee might be the perfect choice to do something similar. The folk/rock duo had carved a niche for themselves in Los Angeles as one of the few acts playing over 200 local and out-of-town dates per year either as a duo, with their band Hard Rain, at their annual Bob Dylan Birthday Party (now in its 17th year), or recreating The Band&#8217;s legendary Last Waltz concert.

This unique performance concept resulted in an Evening of Music &amp; Poetry performed monthly since January 2007 at various venues in Los Angeles.

When his wife introduced him to yoga several years ago, Brian rediscovered his love of poetry and started writing again. Since then his poems have been featured in Gentle Strength Quarterly and several issues of Yogi Times Magazine.

In 2005 Renee Safier&#8217;s blues and jazz vocal chops won the Telluride Blues Festival&#8217;s Acoustic Blues Competition.

Indeed, the Small Press Review declares, &quot;Smith writes the way Tina Turner sings.&quot; Smith's most recent collection, Teahouse of the Almighty , was chosen by Ed Sanders for the 2005 National Poetry Series, and was published by Coffee House Press in 2006. Her three previous books of poetry are, Close to Death (Zoland Books), Big Towns, Big Talk (Zoland Books), and Life According to Motown (Tia Chucha).

      <itunes:summary>Internationally renowned as a performance poet, Patricia Smith is four-time national individual champion of the notorious and wildly popular poetry slam, an energized competition where poets are judged on the content and performance of their work. She is also regarded as one of the few performance poets whose work translates effortlessly to the page. Indeed, the Small Press Review declares, &quot;Smith writes the way Tina Turner sings.&quot; Smith's most recent collection, Teahouse of the Almighty , was chosen by Ed Sanders for the 2005 National Poetry Series, and was published by Coffee House Press in 2006. Her three previous books of poetry are, Close to Death (Zoland Books), Big Towns, Big Talk (Zoland Books), and Life According to Motown (Tia Chucha). She has won the prestigious Carl Sandburg Award, as well as a literary award from the Illinois Arts Council and an honorary degree from the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In 2006, she was inducted into the International Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent, putting her in the company of Zora Neale Hurston, Toni Morrison, James Baldwin, Langston Hughes, Alice Walker, and others.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17764/600x600_1070588.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buffett's full-bodied electronic sound and rock-influenced accessibility make his music a congenial transition between the lighter pop instrumentals that have flooded the market and artists who are pushing the boundaries of modern electronic music with more challenging fare. The Nebraska-born pianist went to Stanford University, where he converted his Bay Area apartment into an efficient recording studio that provides soundtracks for numerous advertising, television, and film companies. Upon hearing of Kevin Costner's plans to create the movie Dances with Wolves, Buffett sent the actor a copy of his album One by One, which featured several cuts inspired by the plight of Native Americans. Costner was impressed enough to use some of Buffett's music in the film. Buffett's four Narada recordings combine a flair for drama and cinematic-style electronic orchestrations with his interest in Native American cultures. His later albums feature a progressively more prominent use of acoustic timbres, both sampled and authentic. ~ Linda Kohanov, All Music Guide

      <title>Jerry Wennstrum on The Inspired Heart</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17764/600x600_780197.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jerry was trained in art, however. &#8220;I went to school for three years at Rockland Community College and the State University of New Paltz, both in New York. One day, the one teacher who believed in me and saw how committed I was as an artist said to me, &#8216;What are you doing here? Why don&#8217;t you just go out and do it?&#8217; He said the one thing that I knew I needed to do, but was afraid to. Even though I had almost completed my degree program, when he said this to me, I walked straight out the door, never to return. I do have an A.A. degree, for those interested in my minimal credentials.&#8221; 

At age 29, he set out to discover the rock-bottom truth of his life. For years he questioned the limits of his creative life as a studio painter. After destroying all of his art and giving away everything he owned, Jerry began a life of unconditional trust, allowing life to provide all that was needed. He lived this way for over 10 years and then moved to the state of Washington, where he married Marilyn Strong and produced a large new body of art. 

Jerry was approached by the publisher at Sentient Publications and asked to write a book about those years, which he agreed to do. The book was completed in 4 months and titled, &quot;The Inspired Heart,&quot; published by Sentient Publications in the Fall of 2002. He and Marilyn have finished an extensive booksigning and lecture tour. (Read sample chapters and foreword by Thomas Moore.) 

Marilyn and Jerry&#8217;s charming Whidbey Island home is now filled with his unique sculptures and paintings. He also built a 40-foot meditation tower, the Flaming Stupa, on his property. 

A video of Jerry&#8217;s life and work, In the Hands of Alchemy, is available from Parabola. Jerry is available for film showings, speaking engagements, and workshops with his wife&#8212;singer and adult education teacher, Marilyn Strong. 

Jerry, Marilyn, and the Flaming Stupa are featured in a chapter of a new book called, &quot;Holy Personal: Looking for Small Private Places of Worship&quot; by Laura Chester, with photos by Dona Demari, and foreword by Thomas Moore (Indiana University Press).

Her poems have appeared in most poetry and literary magazines in the U.S.A., and her work has been included in virtually every major anthology of recent writing by women. She has given more than 700 readings across the U.S.A. and has appeared at Dartmouth and Skidmore colleges, Cornell University, the Shakespeare Library, Whitney Museum, and Huntington Library. Lyn Lifshin has also taught poetry and prose writing for many years at universities, colleges and high schools, and has been Poet in Residence at the University of Rochester, Antioch, and Colorado Mountain College. Winner of numerous awards including the Jack Kerouac Award for her book Kiss The Skin Off, Lyn is the subject of the documentary film Lyn Lifshin: Not Made of Glass. For her absolute dedication to the small presses which first published her, and for managing to survive on her own apart from any major publishing house or academic institution, Lifshin has earned the distinction &quot;Queen of the Small Presses.&quot; She has been praised by Robert Frost, Ken Kesey and Richard Eberhart, and Ed Sanders has seen her as &quot;a modern Emily Dickinson.&quot;</description>

In 2003, he began his column Poetry &amp; Poets in Rags, a Tuesday night weekly that is carried by the InterBoard Poetry Community (IBPC), part of the Web Del Sol site, at http://www.webdelsol.com/IBPC/wire_rags.htm. For the past two years, he has published a companion blog at http://poetryandpoetsinrags.blogspot.com. Poetry &amp; Poets in Rags is essentially a clearing house of links on current poetry articles, keeping the online poetry world informed, connected, represented, and hopefully growing in influence.
 
He blogs his own writings and poetry selections at Clattery MacHinery on Poetry, where his most popular article has been Alley War Poetry: http://clatterymachinery.wordpress.com/2007/09/24/alley-war-poetry. His writing has appeared in online publications such as Aught, Melic Review, The Quarterly Journal of Ideology, and recently in the anthology Best of Cafe&#226;&#8364; Cafe&#226;&#8364;, Summer 2007.

For the past two years, he has been scheduling and inviting the esteemed judges for IBPC's monthly and annual contests. His efforts are for positive change through poetry, and his commitment is to the world community of poets, and specifically online poets, those who participate at the workshops (http://clatterymachinery.wordpress.com/2006/07/19/25-online-poetry-forums-and-workshops), and those who foster the growth of poetry on and through the web.

His 1969 single, &quot;Cherry Hill Park,&quot; peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100.
During the 1980s, Royal scored a comeback with several Top 10 country hits, including &quot;Tell It Like It Is,&quot; &quot;Burned Like a Rocket,&quot; and &quot;I'll Pin a Note on Your Pillow.&quot;
When his rejuvenated career as a country music hitmaker quieted down, he followed up with bookings throughout the 1990s in large country music bars and became a successful act on that circuit. And, he is still making music. His latest release is &#8220;Going By Daydreams.&#8221;  Check http://BillyJoeRoyal.com  for more info.

      <title>GAS 62 Tribute to Robert Burns w/ Janice Hale-Hobby</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17764/600x600_637277.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scotland's National Bard, Robert Burns, gave a voice to ordinary life and was himself as much an inspiration as his poetry. Burns profound belief in the worth of every human being, no matter who they are or what their origins was the most inspiring aspect of the man. He may have endured grinding poverty for most of his short life, but he did not allow hardship to destroy his future.

Nearly 250 years after his birth, the greatest tribute we can pay Robert Burns is to adopt his worldview and recognize that every child is exceptional no matter where they are from or what their circumstances.

      <title>GAs 44 with  Mystical Music of CaDra</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/17764/600x600_637292.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CaDra is a studio project around producer rakenDra Smit and multi-instrumentalist/singer Caroline Beukenkamp. 
In their sound studio in Amstelveen, in the Netherlands, they play and experiment with sounds, vocals, instruments, song structures and words from all over the world. 

Their mystic popmusic seduces the listener to open up. The music, though, is only an excuse to guide the listener towards the end of it, towards the fade-out. The fade-out is a very important element in their music. They take great care in letting a song disappear very smoothly into the big silence. 

In the East they have a certain meditation practice which is called the 'Temple-Bell Meditation'. Early in the morning the monks keep their attention fixed to the decaying sound of a temple bell. These bell sounds last very long and when the last subtle overtone dies out, that's the moment..., that's when you can dissolve in Sunyata, in a state of bliss beyond fear.
