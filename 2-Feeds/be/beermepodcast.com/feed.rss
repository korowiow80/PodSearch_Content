                             <title>Beer Me Podcast Episode 40: Malt Liquor! </title>
		<description> Episode 40 brings with it a no-brainer: The History of Malt Liquor!  We don't drink any 40's though.  Why punish ourselves?  Instead, we dig into Eric Wurm's gift package and pull out the long-awaited Surly Furious.  Enjoy, and make sure to spill a little on the ground for the dead homies. </description>

		<description> Let us just apologize up front for all of the Charlie Sheen-isms that will come spewing forth into your ear sockets when you listen to this week's episode.  Other than that, this one's Brett's Pliny the Younger experience and we drink a growler of Black Market Brewing Company's GABF Gold Medal-winning Rye IPA.  Cheers! </description>

		<description> Just try and keep up with us as we go through the remainder of the Midwest craft beer stash that our fan and friend Eric Wurm sent us.  6 beers in an hour is something you should look for us to do again.  Just don't blame us when we're buzzed to goofiness.  Cheers! </description>

		<description> If you don't have a Trader Joe's store near you, then you're just missing out.  Not that their beer selection is the best around, but what they contract out can be incredible and very inexpensive.  This may sound like a commercial, but really it is a hope that we can get free stuff from them.  So download and hold your breath along with us until they do.  Cheers! </description>

		<description> In the episode, Brett's Dubbel Hangover is tried by Josh for the first time, we talk about the upcoming American Craft Beer Week (May 16-22) and the Southern California Homebrewers Festival.  We then top it all off with a bottle of Stone's Lukcy Basartd (that's not a typo!) that Brett saved for Josh to try before it was all gone for the year.  What a good cousin, huh?  Cheers! </description>

                             <title>Beer Me Podcast Episode 46: The Primitive Wild</title>
		<description> We were lucky enough this week to finally crack a bottle from one of our favorite breweries - Deproefbrouwerij out of Lochristi Belgium - of Flemish Primitive Wild Ale.  First, though, we begin with the Stone/Port/Green Flash Highway 78 Scotch Ale.  We also talk a little news and rejoice in the fact that we got a chance to record and that we still have so many beers in our collection that we're eager to sample.  Look for those soon, but for now, crack one of your finest and join us.  Cheers! </description>

                             <title>Beer Me Podcast Episode 47: Beer Nerdiness</title>
		<description> Somehow, Josh and Brett get sidetracked by tech-talk and we go off the rails.  Maybe it was how good this episode's beers were: Schneider/Brooklyn's Hopfenweisse collaboration and Flying Dog's Raging Bitch Belgian IPA.  Who knows - maybe you'll learn something geeky?  Cheers! </description>

                             <title>Beer Me Podcast Episode 48: Beer Me...QUICK!</title>
		<description> Josh has a moment and we decide to do a quick strike if for no other reason than to have a beer we haven't tried before.  And maybe to help keep us sane as well.  So Brett picked out The Bruery/Cigar City collaboration Imperial Oud Bruin called MarrÃ³n AcidifiÃ© for the special and welcome occasion.  Enjoy our first of possibly many half-episodes. </description>

                             <title>Beer Me Podcast Episode 51: A Tale of Two Flying Dogs</title>
		<description> Brett has been a big proponent of Flying Dog's beer for a while and Josh has been needing to try it.  Today, it all comes together once again.  We delve into some of the interesting history of this brewery and the characters surrounding its creation over 20 years ago.  Find some of this ale, download the episode and join us.  And, as Dr. Gonzo said, " As your attorney, I advise you to take a hit out of the little brown bottle in my shaving kit. You won't need much, just a tiny taste." </description>

                             <title>Beer Me Podcast Episode 52: Schmidy's Tavern</title>
		<description> We've finally done a year's worth of podcasts (if you listen to once a week - any more could be dangerous, so we decided to do something special: GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!  Brent Schmidman, owner of Schmidy's Tavern in Palm Desert, CA, kindly invited us to come down and do a podcast.  And then Greg Nettles, our local Stone Distribution representative, showed up!  We talk craft beer, homebrew, Stone, Beer School and harass random bar patrons (mostly the cute ones).  Beware, it was a busy Wednesday night and there is some music in the background.  Nothing we could do about that.  So to make up for it, we included some new intro and outro clips of Brett's former band, Mr. Jonez.  The intro is from "Where Did You Go?" and the outro is Brett's guitar solo from a song called "Let Me Go."  More podcasts like this to come!  Cheers! </description>

		<description> Josh and I, after battling various palate-debilitating illnesses, get around to opening a couple of beers and giving a new piece of recording equipment a whirl.  Sorry about the noise in advance, but we did what we could when we could.  Ringing endorsement, huh?  Cheers! </description>

                             <title>Beer Me Podcast Episode 55: Schmidy's Time is Here</title>
		<description> It's just after Christmas and we thought it'd be a good idea to visit our favorite local pub for another chat with owner Brent Schmidman at Schmidy's Tavern.  With the help of the lovely Megan and a few pub-goers, we drink some of Brent's fine bottle stash and talk about stuff.  And by stuff, I mean beer.  Cheers! </description>

		<description> Finally, our friend and fellow homebrewer Chris Anderson joins owner Brent Schmidman to talk to us about plans for making our home-pub into a juggernaut, Chris' brewing history and various stories and anecdotes about things.  In other words: we shoot the shit while drinking top-quality beer.  And, thanks to Josh, we have a new intro.  Let us know what you think! </description>

		<description> Josh and Brett have a free moment and try Sierra Nevada's Harvest ales side by side and blended to dissect what we like best in general, and like about both beers in particular.  All the while we do are usual talking.  I'm sure you'll be delighted that this audio podcast does indeed have talking in it.  And beer.  Ready for some stuff?  Start clicking! </description>
