			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is sad to think about writing a <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/jack-lalanne-death-jack-lalanne-obituary.php">Jack Lalanne obituary</a>. However, with Jack Lalanne&#8217;s death, we will remember his generous contribution to the <em><strong>juicing for health</strong></em> industry. </p>
<p>This man managed to introduce millions of folks to healthy living, both through his focus on nutrition and his emphasis on physical exercise.</p>
<p>Many folks believe that the only &#8216;good&#8217; juicer is a Norwalk or a Champion juicer. In the end, though, ordinary people may feel intimidated by the philosophy behind these <em><strong>juice extractor machines</strong></em>.</p>
<p>For juicing newbies, it is often way easier to start with a more ordinary, easy to use juicer. And that is why there will always be a market for the Jack Lalanne Power Juicer Elite or one of the other Lalanne juicers. </p>
<p>As every single <em><strong>Jack Lalanne obituary</strong></em> will emphasise, this man succeeded in inspiring ordinary people like you and me to opt for a more healthy lifestyle. He continued to display an amazing physique and activity level, a testament to the benefits of disciplined, healthy living over many, many years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Jack Lalanne&#8217;s death</strong></em> should bring our attention back to his message. That will be our best tribute to this industry giant!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What to do with all that juicer pulp? Juice for health and you are bound to be left with lots of dry, but somewhat tasteless pulp. So, what are your options? Do you simply throw away the juicer pulp, or is there a recipe for putting it to better use? Let&#8217;s take a quick look at some ideas to point you in the right direction:</p>
<ul>
<li> We love to use the pulp on our compost heap. Our plants thrive on it. This is one of the best ways to create extra compost. Or how about giving an earthworm farm some yummy treats?
<li> Carrot pulp, apple pulp and other fruit pulp can be incorporated into cakes such as carrot cake, a rich chocolate cake or apple pies&#8230;Yum! This process will intensify the flavor. Your friends will all wonder how you did it!
<li> Onion and celery pulp can be used in muffin mixtures and savory breads.
<li> A variety of veggie pulp can be used in dips, soups and sauces.
<li> Meatloaf and hamburger can easily get added flavor and taste in a healthy way by adding pulp. Not to mention the additional fiber!
<li> Some folks add the pulp when making dog biscuits.
<li> Frozen treats can be stretched with the help of pulp. Try yogurt, some pulp and a touch of honey.
<li> You can easily freeze the pulp in freezer bags. Store the bags flat, in order to be able to remove just the quantity you need. Add some lemon juice to keep the colors bright.
<li> Read juicing books such as <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/juice-extractor-book-crocker.php"><strong>&#8216;The Juicing Bible&#8217;</strong></a> by Pat Crocker and Susan Eagles for more tips on using juicer pulp in a variety of recipes.
</ul>
<p>However, remember that most of the nutrients are removed during the juicing process. So, whether you are using the <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/lequip.php"><strong>L&#8217;Equip 110.5 Mini Pulp Ejector Juicer</strong></a> or a <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/breville-juicer.php"><strong>Breville Juicer 800JEXL</strong></a>, you will be left with what is just a fairly dry kind of fiber. </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t feel too bad about not always using the pulp to the full. You are already doing your body a huge favor by getting all those crucial vitamins, enzymes and minerals out of the fruits and vegetables for easy assimilation. Of course the fiber will be beneficial if you can find a way to use it. </p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t stop juicing because you hate throwing away the juicer pulp! The easiest route probably is to integrate it into your garden&#8217;s compost heap.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As part of the cabbage family, the watercress plant is packed with health-creating nutrients. The peppery taste is superb in fresh salads, and will also add zing to a <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/healthy-fruit-and-vegetable-juicing-recipes.php"><strong>vegetable juice recipe</strong></a>. Just don&#8217;t add too much, as it is quite potent and can taste somewhat bitter. Oh, yes, and don&#8217;t forget the popular watercress soup!</p>
<p><strong>Nutritional And Health Benefits Of Watercress</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> A good source of crucial elements such as vitamins B1 and B6, beta-carotene, vitamin E, as well as zinc, calcium, magnesium, iron and vitamin C
<li> It is an excellent way to add fiber to your diet
<li> Being a member of the cabbage family, watercress has anti-cancer properties
<li> The watercress plant is good for your eyes, due to high levels of lutein and zeaxanthin, two carotenoids
<li> It may very well help to keep you younger mentally and physically
<li> Water cress may help to lower your cholesterol
<li> It is also good for your heart and may reduce plaque in the arteries
<li> This green is extremely low in calories, so it can be used freely when juicing for weight loss
<li> As with cucumber, watercress will help to reduce fluid retention
<li> Due to its cleansing properties, it may assist in clearing up your skin problems
<li> Another benefit of water cress is that it helps with digestion, by aiding bile flow regulation
<li> As in the case of parsley, watercress can help to fight bad breath
</ul>
<p>When used in juicing, you can have watercress with other fruits and veggies such as carrots, apples, parsley, celery and beetroot. Don&#8217;t try to drink it on its own. And, remember that you should never take <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/medication-and-juicing-for-health.php"><strong>medication with your juice</strong></a>, as absorption may be affected.</p>
<p>Use the freshest leaves you can find to get the most from these greens. Don&#8217;t store the leaves for more than 2 or 3 days. Keep watercress in the refrigerator. </p>
<p>Research has shown that <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/what-is-watercress-health-benefits-of-watercress-nutrition.php">watercress benefits</a> surpass those of other, more frequently used veggies, such as broccoli.</p>
<p><strong><em>Rika Susan</em></strong></p>
<p>PS: The fun juicing recipe program I use can get you started with watercress recipes and much more. <strong><a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/greatrecipes/">Read about it here&#8230;</a></strong></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Getting just the right juicer machine for your needs may seem like a daunting task at first. When you start out, you probably won&#8217;t know how to compare a centrifugal juicer with a twin gear model. All you want is a collection of <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/healthy-fruit-and-vegetable-juicing-recipes.php"><strong>great-tasting juice extractor recipes</strong></a>. Let&#8217;s take a quick look at some of the basics you need to keep in mind when choosing your first juicer machine.</p>
<p><strong>Ease Of Use</strong></p>
<p>For me, this is one of the most important aspects. If the juicing process isn&#8217;t quick and fairly painless, I know I won&#8217;t be doing it! So, I opted for a <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/breville-juicer.php"><strong>Breville Juice Fountain Elite</strong></a> that is really simple to use. I wanted one with a generously sized feeding chute, in order to minimize preparation time. I don&#8217;t want to waste precious time cutting veggies into smaller chunks. Feeding the produce into this ravenous juicer machine, is also super fast. </p>
<p>Also check that the machine is light enough to handle with ease and that you will be able to assemble it without any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Cleaning</strong></p>
<p>This is another crucial issue. I am sure that, like me, you don&#8217;t have time to spend an hour scrubbing finicky nooks and crannies every time you use your juicer. You probably want to know that the machine&#8217;s parts only require a quick rinse and brush.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrient Retention</strong></p>
<p>The higher the RPM&#8217;s of your machine, the more heat will be generated, leading to loss of nutrients. With a centrifugal juicer, such as the Breville Juice Fountain Elite, this is an unfortunate drawback. Juicers like the <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/norwalk-juicer.php"><strong>Norwalk</strong></a> and the twin gear <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/green-star-juicer.php"><strong>Greenstar juicer</strong></a> claim to create &#8216;healthier&#8217; juice. However, the juicing process is much more complicated and cleaning is more involved. So, I chose to opt for a simple, easy-to-use centrifugal model. Daily juicing is more important than a few enzymes lost here and there&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Juicer Comparison</strong></p>
<p>A centrifugal model comes with a type of shredder that spins at a high speed. The spinning forces the juice out of the fiber and into a container. At the same time, the pulp is separated into a basket. These juicers have fewer movable parts, can manage most fruits and veggies and are generally easier to clean. However, while they allow you to come up with the best <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/healthy-fruit-and-vegetable-juicing-recipes.php"><strong>juice extractor recipes</strong></a>, they don&#8217;t have other functions. Infomercials often promote these machines, as in the case of the <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/jack-lalane-juicers.php"><strong>Jack Lalane Juicer</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The masticating juicers (twin gear models like the Greenstar or single gear machines) operate at lower speeds and are therefore better for nutrient retention. They have a &#8216;chewing&#8217; kind of action. The juicing process is usually slower and cleaning can also be more difficult. They can also be more expensive. A benefit is that many of them come with other functions such as making pasta, baby food making and nut butters. So, they are more versatile.</p>
<p>Of course, you can also opt for citrus juicers, sugar cane juicers and manual wheat grass juicers.</p>
<p><strong>Family Size</strong></p>
<p>If you only have to juice for yourself, you can probably get by with quite a small juicer. For a family of four you need something that is a bit more robust. When juicing for a family, feeding tiny chunks of veggies into a small juicer will take forever and you are likely to discover that the motor isn&#8217;t tough enough to cope with the load. In the long run it will be more cost-effective to opt for a larger model.</p>
<p><strong>Type Of Produce</strong></p>
<p>You also need to consider exactly what you want to juice. For wheatgrass, you may need a dedicated wheatgrass juicer. The same is true for sugar cane. </p>
<p><strong>Noise</strong></p>
<p>Some of the centrifugal juicer machines may be very noisy during use. This is the case with the Breville. Try to see the machine in action, in order to get an idea of the noise level.</p>
<p><strong>Warranty</strong></p>
<p>Juicing can be tough on the motor, so make sure that you get a juice extractor with a good warranty. The warranty period can often be an indication of the quality of the juicer machine.</p>
<p>Judging by the longevity they apparently help to create, centrifugal juicer machines such as <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/jack-lalane-power-juicer-elite.php"><strong>Jack Lalanne&#8217;s Power Juicer Elite</strong></a> retains more than enough nutrients for a healthy body!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right, you have your Breville or Jack Lalane juicer ready to go, but how do you know what to juice? This depends largely on taste. Your palate and digestive system will soon give you an indication of which juicer recipe combinations work best for you. </p>
<p>There are of course also a variety of informative <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/book-buzz.php"><strong>juicing books</strong></a> on the market with tips. Or you may want to make your life a whole lot easier by experimenting with the new, user-friendly <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/healthy-fruit-and-vegetable-juicing-recipes.php"><strong>EZJuice juicing recipe software</strong></a>, as I have.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, carrots form the base of most vegetable juicing recipes. If you are new to juicing, start simple. Experiment with a combination of carrots, apples, tomato and grapes. As you become a bit more adventurous, you can add celery, cucumber and beetroot. I also add some cabbage and broccoli to this concoction, but these can have a strong taste, so use them sparingly.</p>
<p>When juicing carrots, discard the greens (more about produce preparation later on). Oranges need to be peeled, but try to keep as much as possible of the white layer intact. Juicing carrots, tomato, apples and oranges together work extremely well if you are a newbie. The taste is absolutely excellent.</p>
<p>Beet adds a stunning color to the drink, as well as some flavor. However, this is a very potent cleanser and should be used sparingly.</p>
<p>Add green veggies as soon as you can, as these come with the most important nutrients. Start with lettuce and spinach, and introduce cabbage, endive and broccoli gradually. This becomes powerful stuff! You don&#8217;t need to juice spinach more than once or twice per week.</p>
<p>Wheat grass has an extremely strong taste and also is a no-no for many juice extractors. You may have to purchase a dedicated wheat grass juicer. Don&#8217;t start out with this, however. Although wheat grass is packed with valuable properties, introduce it slowly over time, and don&#8217;t give it to young children.</p>
<p>If you want to know my secret for always having <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/healthy-fruit-and-vegetable-juicing-recipes.php"><strong>just the right juicing recipe</strong></a> available for the experiment I have in mind, be sure to read this article&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When choosing between fruit juice and vegetable juice, it is all about balance. Of course fruit juices usually taste better, but always keep in mind that these come with a much higher sugar level. This causes a fairly rapid rise in blood sugar. If you have diabetes or a thrush problem, you need to limit your intake of fruit juice and preferably discuss your juicing program with your doctor.</p>
<p>Concentrate on vegetable juice if you are <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com"><strong>juicing for health</strong></a> and try to vary your intake, as each type has a unique range of nutrients. You should always aim for a balanced intake of vitamins, enzymes and minerals by juicing as colorful a range of produce as possible. Add fruits for taste, but don&#8217;t make them the main ingredient.</p>
<p>If you need to lose weight, vegetable juice is ideal, as it comes at a low calorie cost and is fat free.</p>
<p>If you are healthy, the natural sugar or fructose in fruits can&#8217;t harm you. It is easily assimilated. While it is high in sugar, it has a low glycemic index (GI), so it isn&#8217;t as harmful as far as glucose levels are concerned, as table sugar. You can always dilute fruit juices with water, to lessen your sugar intake. This is also a good idea if you are dealing with children.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have discovered the joys of <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/healthy-fruit-and-vegetable-juicing-recipes.php"><strong>healthy fruit or vegetable juicing recipes</strong></a>, your palate may soon begin to ask for other delicious, fresh taste sensations. I have just discovered the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/series/recipes_for_health/index.html"target="newwindow"><strong>Recipes For Health section at the New York Times</strong></a> and found some tempting food for thought there. Don&#8217;t stop at vegetable and fruit juicing recipes - you must try these as well.</p>
<p>If you are juicing for health, you know that beets are packed with nutritional value. And they can come in many other great-tasting guises - you don&#8217;t have to stick with juicing to make the most of them. In fact, the humble beet is popping up in many a high-end restaurant, according to the New York Times.</p>
<p>How about recipes such as </p>
<ul>
<li> Sautéed Beet Greens With Garlic and Olive Oil</li>
<li> Mediterranean Beet and Yogurt Salad</li>
<li> Beet and Endive Salad With Walnuts</li>
</ul>
<p>We need to get rid of the junk food mentality and learn to taste, smell and see again. Becoming more aware of colors, aromas and textures will help us to be drawn back into natural eating. Juicer recipes can help, but preparing real food for our families is equally important. We can learn to cook healthy, appetizing meals daily.  From family dinner recipes, snacks for kids or Southern Living recipes can be found in the Recipes For Health section of the New York Times. The recipes have all been tried and tested. </p>
<p>Remember, your kids look to you as a role model. Are you teaching them to make smart food choices, or to follow the crowd by eating junk food day after day? </p>
<p>So, by all means start with <a href="http://www.best-juicing.com/healthy-fruit-and-vegetable-juicing-recipes.php"><strong>healthy fruit and vegetable juicing recipes</strong></a>. But also pop in at the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/series/recipes_for_health/index.html" target="newwindow"><strong>New York Times</strong></a> for some taste bud treats. Enjoy!</p>
