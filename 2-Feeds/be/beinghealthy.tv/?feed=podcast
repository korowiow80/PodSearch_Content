<p>We all visit the doctor at some point in our lives, no matter how well we care for our health, whether it be for a check-up or to treat a medical condition.  When we do go, having a positive experience is very important for obtaining the best treatment possible.  Unfortunately, when many people need to choose a doctor, they are unsure how to select the right one.  So, they often just pick the closest one that takes their insurance and is accepting new patients.  And once they&#8217;ve selected a doctor, they don&#8217;t know how to take an active role in their own healthcare.  Neither that patient selection process nor that passive relationship with the doctor is optimal.  So, today I&#8217;ll discuss some considerations when selecting a health care practitioner, how to improve communication and when to seek a second opinion.</p>

<p>As you all know, today&#8217;s fast paced world can be very stressful.  It  pulls us in a million and one directions, and we&#8217;re always rushing to meet an unending string of deadlines and the expectations placed on us by our employers, friends and even our families.  I know that it can often be hard not to get anxious or stressed.  As if it wasn&#8217;t bad enough that all that pressure is zero fun, on top of that, chronic stress negatively impacts our overall health.  It can lead to sleep problems, depression, anxiety, chest pain, high blood pressure, burnout, the inability to enjoy life, etc.  That is why it is important to minimize stress whenever possible.  Because we&#8217;re all striving for a contented life, where we&#8217;re happy, healthy and free of chronic stress, aren&#8217;t we?</p>
<p>So, what should you do if your days are consistently stressful?  Well, the first thing you need to do is learn to manage your stress.  One excellent way to do that is through meditation.  Meditation helps to dissipate tension and bring a sense of calm and inner peace.  Since meditation is such a useful tool for managing stress, I am dedicating this show to the practice of Meditation.  I&#8217;ll cover what meditation is, its benefits and some tips on how you can start meditating on your own.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dining out is fun, but choosing the right foods can be challenging for people trying to eat healthy.  While most people can make nutritious choices when eating at home, they often let healthy eating habits slide when eating out and order items that are high in fat, calories, sodium and cholesterol.   And it doesn&#8217;t help that many dishes offered at restaurants are prepared in a manner that makes them even higher in fat and calories than the same dish would be if it were prepared at home.   However, despite these challenges, eating a healthy meal when dining out is still attainable.   You just need to make sound nutritional choices and know what to order and what to avoid.</p>
<p>So, since most people enjoy eating out, but struggle to be healthy while doing it, I&#8217;m dedicating not only this show, but 12 more shows to what foods to choose and what foods to avoid when dining out at certain types of restaurants.  A new “<strong>Being Healthy While Eating Out</strong>” show will come out monthly for a year.   Each episode will be released on the 4th Sunday of each month. This episode will focus on general tips that will help you to eat healthy no matter what cuisine you will be enjoying.</p>
<p><strong>Announcement: </strong>Being Healthy for Busy People, my audio show, is a <a href="http://podcastawards.com/">Podcast Awards</a> finalist!  Daily voting will run till November 30th.  If you have time, please go and vote for my podcast under Health/Fitness as many days as you can!  Thank you!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When people think of olive oil, they almost always think about the Mediterranean diet.   That&#8217;s because olive oil is a key ingredient in many recipes from the Mediterranean region.   However, because of it&#8217;s wonderful taste and amazing health benefits, olive oil is also growing in popularity outside the Mediterranean.  That is no surprise because olive oil has a way of enriching and complimenting dishes, such as fish, pastas, meats, salads, soups and so forth.  It really is a wonderful ingredient to add to almost any dish.   So much so, that olive oil has become a staple in my household.</p>
<p>So, today I&#8217;m going to share the health benefits of olive oil that led me to fall in love with it and use it in so many of the dishes I prepare.   I&#8217;ll also cover some important tips I learned in regards to choosing and storing olive oil.   And of course, the show wouldn&#8217;t be complete if I didn&#8217;t mention a couple tasty ways that you can add a little more olive oil to your diet.</p>

<p>With winter approaching, the prospect of going indoors to exercise because of cold weather have some people bummed.  They are just not gym people.  But cold weather doesn&#8217;t have to mean the end of outdoor exercise.  With a little planning and preparation, running, cycling or walking can be done during cold weather.  That&#8217;s why, with winter just around the corner for much of the world, it&#8217;s time to talk about how to safely and effectively work out in cold weather.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people who are trying to get fit or lose weight, understand that aerobic exercise is a key component of reaching their goals.  The question isn&#8217;t: “Should we do aerobic exercise?”  It&#8217;s: “How intensely should we do aerobic exercise?”  The answer that we usually hear is that working out at a moderate exercise intensity enables us to get the most out of our workouts.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not exactly sure what moderate exercise intensity is supposed to feel like, you&#8217;re not alone.   Many people don&#8217;t truly understand how exercise intensity is measured.   Today, I&#8217;ll remedy that by teaching you why it is important to exercise at a certain intensity and how to measure it, so that you can get the most out of your workouts.</p>
<p>Here is the <em>Karvonen formula</em> as I promised: (MHR-RHR)*intensity)+ RHR = Target Heart Rate</p>
<p><strong>Announcement: </strong>Being Healthy for Busy People, my audio show, is a <a href="http://podcastawards.com">Podcast Awards</a> finalist! Thank you to everyone who nominated my show.  I am very excited about being a finalist!  Daily voting will begin on November 13th and will run till November 30th.   If you have time, please go and vote for my podcast under Health/Fitness as many days as you can!  Thank you!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Most people who are trying to get fit or lose weight, understand that aerobic exercise is a key component of reaching their goals.  The question isn&#039;t: “Should we do aerobic exercise?”  It&#039;s: “How intensely should we do aerobic exercise?”  The answer that we usually hear is that working out at a moderate exercise intensity enables us to get the most out of our workouts.

If you&#039;re not exactly sure what moderate exercise intensity is supposed to feel like, you&#039;re not alone.   Many people don&#039;t truly understand how exercise intensity is measured.   Today, I&#039;ll remedy that by teaching you why it is important to exercise at a certain intensity and how to measure it, so that you can get the most out of your workouts.

Here is the Karvonen formula as I promised: (MHR-RHR)*intensity)+ RHR = Target Heart Rate

<p>Today&#8217;s show was inspired by a trip that I took to Beijing, China with <a href="http://www.vansunder.com">David</a> about 3 years ago.  I was reminded of the trip a few days ago when I was looking through some of my photos and came across some of the many photos we took during that trip.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful 10 day trip and we had a fantastic time visiting places, such as the Great Wall, The Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, the Beijing Zoo, etc&#8230;  Being who I am, the one thing from the trip that really stuck in my mind, besides the amazing historical sites, was our walk through what I believe was the Temple of Heaven Park.   As we walked through that impressive park, I noticed that there were a bunch of people in the middle of the park performing slow dance-like flowing movements.  When I asked our tour guide what they were doing, he told us that the group of people were practicing Tai Chi. The graceful images of those people gliding through different poses made an impression on me. So, when I came back home I started researching Tai Chi.  I was interested to find out what the practice of tai-chi was all about and how it could be beneficial to one&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>So, in this episode I will share with you my findings.  I will go over what Tai Chi is, the health benefits it provides and how to get started.<br />

<p>It is normal to occasionally feel sad or unhappy with a situation.   Life can be stressful and overwhelming at times and can lead people to feel sad.  Things like breakups, losing a job, getting a pay cut, having an argument with a friend or spouse are all examples of things that can bring on sadness, pain or grief.  However, these negative emotions usually fade with time.  But with depression, those feelings can linger for weeks, months or even years and are more intense than just the normal blues.</p>
<p>Depression is not uncommon though.   It is estimated that about 12 million adults suffer from depression in the United States alone.  That is quite a few people affected.  So, today I will go over how depression is different from normal sadness, what symptoms to watch for, the different types of depression, who is at risk and ways to prevent and cope with depression.</p>

<p>You just started exercising and you felt great, so you dramatically increased the intensity and duration of your workout.  While doing that you felt a dull pain.   Over the next few days the pain recurred intermittently, but it wasn&#8217;t bad enough to interfere with your exercise.   So, you pushed on, ignoring the pain.   As time passed, the pain got to the point where you felt the pain during and after your exercise as well.</p>
<p>This is an example of an overuse injury, specifically tendinitis, which is one of the most common sports related injuries.   Now, in previous shows I covered other types of sports injuries, such as muscle soreness and cramps (<a href="http://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/bh4bp0040/">show 40</a>) and sprains and strains (<a href="http://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/bh4bp0044/">show 44</a>).   But in this show I am going to talk about tendinitis.   I&#8217;ll tell you what it is, who is at risk, ways to prevent it and what to do if you get it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was introduced to rooibos 7 years ago when David and I were celebrating our first anniversary at a fine restaurant in Palo Alto, California.   After we finished our delicious meal, we decided to cap our celebration with some tea and a shared dessert.   Our server suggested that we try their loose leaf rooibos tea to match our dessert.  So, feeling adventurous, we went for it.  And that night we fell in love with the sweet, soothing herbal red tea.   Since then, we have been drinking it nightly, which those of you who follow me on twitter know already.   I am a HUGE fan of rooibos because not only does it taste great, it is also caffeine free, making it an ideal nighttime drink.</p>
<p>So, today my goal is to introduce you to this wonderful herbal, red tea that not only tastes heavenly, but is also very healthy to drink.   So, sit back and enjoy the show!</p>

<p>When your parents said it was important to eat more fruits and vegetables, they were right.  Fruits and vegetables are nutritional powerhouses.   They are loaded with vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants and may help protect us from diseases, such as cancer and heart disease.  But what should you do if your neighborhood store has slim pickings for fresh produce?  Should you head to the frozen section to pick up some frozen or canned produce instead?  Are they just as nutritious?</p>
<p>Those are good questions because if you are buying produce for the health benefits, you want to buy the produce that provides the most nutrition and health benefits.   So, today I&#8217;m going to clear up the confusion a bit and break down the differences between the different options available to you.</p>

<p>Today I am bringing you another Q&amp;A show.   Since the last two have been so well received, I&#8217;m going to continue putting out one of these Q &amp; A shows every month or two, as long as I keep getting lots of questions. Answering them in a podcast seems like the best way to go because if one person has a question, there are probably at least a few more with the same question that didn&#8217;t ask.   This way all of them get the answer all at once.</p>
<p>In this show, we will answer questions about what the perfect running form is and about gaining weight when beginning exercise.  And we also have a comment about the struggle to be healthy when others are trying to sabotage you.</p>
<p>The 2009 Nominations for the Podcast Awards are open!  If you like this show, please head on over to podcastawards.com and nominate it under the<strong> &#8220;Health/Fitness&#8221;</strong> category:</p>

		<itunes:summary>Today I am bringing you another Q&amp;A show.   Since the last two have been so well received, I&#039;m going to continue putting out one of these Q &amp; A shows every month or two, as long as I keep getting lots of questions. Answering them in a podcast seems like the best way to go because if one person has a question, there are probably at least a few more with the same question that didn&#039;t ask.   This way all of them get the answer all at once.

In this show, we will answer questions about what the perfect running form is and about gaining weight when beginning exercise.  And we also have a comment about the struggle to be healthy when others are trying to sabotage you.

<p>This is a common question and the answer given has changed with time, making many people unsure which is the healthier choice.  Is it butter or is it margarine?   This episode will help you to decide before you are confronted with that choice again.  Because the last thing you want to do is spend so much time deciding which spread to use that your bread gets cold before you have a chance to eat it.</p>

<p>Having and working in a garden can play a powerful role in how we feel. The sights and scents of our gardens can soothe us and distract us from everyday stressors.   Gardening has a way of connecting us with nature and the rhythm of life, rejuvenating us and disconnecting us from the more hectic parts of our lives for awhile.   When we garden, we are on garden time, which feels slower than the fast paced regular world.   And we all benefit from slowing down from time to time.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why in this episode I am going to explore the health benefits of gardening and go over whether gardening is a good form of exercise.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us love the flavor and texture of cheese.  It is a tasty addition to a variety of meals.   Plus, cheese can be very nutritious.   It is an excellent source of protein, calcium, vitamin A and phosphorous.  However, on the flip side, most cheeses are also high in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium.   And diets high in saturated fat, cholesterol and sodium can clog our arteries and increase our risk of heart disease and strokes.</p>
<p>So, since many people are partial to the rich and creamy taste of cheese, but are also trying to be healthier, I&#8217;m going to answer the question: <em>Can I eat cheese and still maximize my health? </em></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you constantly complaining to your family, friends or co-workers about feeling tired and worn-out?  Do you have a hard time focusing or keeping your eyes open at work?   If so, you are not alone.  Feeling tired is one of the top 10 symptoms that people mention when visiting their doctor.  Everyone has felt fatigued at some point.   That&#8217;s normal.   It is the body signaling that it is time to rest or sleep.  But if you are persistently tired, then it could be due to an underlying medical problem or the result of a number of unhealthy lifestyle factors working in concert.</p>
<p>Fatigue is an issue for so many people, that I decided to tackle it today, so that at least a few people can get some relief.  So, this episode&#8217;s goal is to help you find ways to boost your energy levels.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our world can be noisy at times and sometimes we have to shout in order to be heard.   That not only changes the pitch of our voice, but can lead to hoarseness.   And some of us work in jobs that require us to use our voices a lot.   Singers, podcasters, teachers, actors and public speakers are all examples of people that depend on their voices in order to do their jobs.   As for me, most of you know that I use my voice quite a bit.   I do 2 weekly podcasts and I work full time as a physical therapist where I use my voice all day long talking with patients.   So, I can&#8217;t afford to lose my voice.</p>
<p>I was reminded of how much many of us depend on our voices in order to do our jobs when I got a little hoarse from all the speaking I&#8217;ve been doing recently.   So, I did some more research on hoarseness and today I am bringing you a few things I learned about how you can protect your voice.   So, sit back and enjoy the show!</p>

<p>There are many things that can cause or aggravate foot problems.   It could be anything from flat feet to diabetic neuropathy to osteoarthritis, just to name a few.   Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately because a lot of you would be bored and stop listening, I don&#8217;t have time to discuss every foot problem.   The podcast would go on forever.   Instead, I am going to focus on 7 common foot problems and give you some tips on how to prevent them.   So, sit back and enjoy the show!</p>

<p>I am a huge fan of nuts!  They are wonderful either as a snack or as an ingredient in a delicious recipe.   I just love eating them in granola, cereal, salads or even on their own.  And the good news is that nuts eaten in moderation can be part of a heart healthy diet.  That is right, I said moderation.  You don&#8217;t want to eat whole cans of nuts, especially the salted kind.</p>
<p>So, since I know it&#8217;s not just me and the squirrels that enjoy nuts, I thought it was time to feature them in the show.   In this episode, I will go over why nuts are heart healthy, why they should be eaten in moderation and I&#8217;ll give some nutritional information on some common types of nuts.</p>

<p>That is why I&#8217;m dedicating this show to convincing the 25% of adults who skip breakfast, that it is an important meal that should not be missed.   I am going to go over why it is important to break your fast (yep that is where the word breakfast comes from) and why you should eat a “healthy, nutritious” breakfast, not a sugary, sweet one. So, sit back and enjoy the show!</p>

		<itunes:summary>Most of us are taught that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.  But it is estimated that about 1 out of 4 adults usually skips breakfast.  I don&#039;t know about you, but that sounds like a lot of people to me!

That is why I&#039;m dedicating this show to convincing the 25% of adults who skip breakfast, that it is an important meal that should not be missed.   I am going to go over why it is important to break your fast (yep that is where the word breakfast comes from) and why you should eat a “healthy, nutritious” breakfast, not a sugary, sweet one. So, sit back and enjoy the show!

<p>This week&#8217;s show, like last week&#8217;s is being recorded in the Fresno area.  So, if you noticed any differences in the sound due to the room acoustics, it&#8217;s the apartment we&#8217;re staying in that&#8217;s causing it.   I&#8217;ll be out here for a few months, so we&#8217;re adjusting our recording setup to minimize echoes.  Bear with us, it should get better.</p>
<p>Many people suspect they have a food allergy when, in reality, they often only have a food intolerance.  The confusion comes because a food intolerance can have some of the same symptoms as a food allergy, even though what causes them is quite different.</p>
<p>Since many people have had an unpleasant reaction to something they ate at one time or another and might have thought it was due to a food allergy, I decided to talk about the differences between food allergies and food intolerances.   In this show, I will cover how to tell them apart and give you some ways to manage them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It feels so good to lift weights and get stronger.  Back in the day, when I owned my own physical therapy clinic, I also did personal training.  You have no idea how many of my clients, especially females, would come in and say, “I don&#8217;t want to lift weights, because I don&#8217;t want to get too big.” In reply to that, I would say “I lift weights and I&#8217;m not big.”</p>
<p>So, today my goal is to put those concerns to rest and convince you to weight train because weight training is an essential part of any exercise program and should not be left out.  So, sit back and enjoy the show!</p>

Some references I used while researching this show are The New Wellness Encyclopedia and sparkpeople.com (http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/fitness_articles.asp?id=964)

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this show, you will be amazed by the improvement in production quality from the first show.  David tweaked a lot of things in post production.  But don&#8217;t worry, we are not done yet.  We have even more changes that we want to make over time to take it to the next level.</p>
<p>Since summer is here, I  thought it would be fitting to cover a popular warm weather goal: Getting a flat belly.   My goal in this show is to teach you the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth about how to achieve a flat, trim stomach.  This is important because many people are not completely happy with their bodies, especially their stomachs.   If it is not as flat as they would like, they are often self conscious about showing it in public, like when they go to the beach.   So, sit back and enjoy the show!</p>

<p>Today is a milestone episode.   We made it to episode 50!   That&#8217;s an episode every Thursday for 50 straight weeks.   Not bad!  And in honor of that, this episode is a listener question episode because I get a lot of great questions and I thought, what better way to thank you all for making the show what is than to dedicate a show to all your questions.</p>
<p>Now I want to remind you that the first episode of the new Being Healthy TV video podcast is coming out this Sunday and every week after that.   So, please <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=319927062">subscribe</a> and, better yet, tell at least one person you know about Being Healthy TV.   The more people that know, the more people I can help!</p>
<p>In this show, I will answer questions regarding exercise induced asthma, suntan lotions with exceptionally high SPF&#8217;s, the accuracy of blood pressure machines in drug stores and the difference between decaf and regular tea.</p>

		<itunes:summary>Today is a milestone episode.   We made it to episode 50!   That&#039;s an episode every Thursday for 50 straight weeks.   Not bad!  And in honor of that, this episode is a listener question episode because I get a lot of great questions and I thought, what better way to thank you all for making the show what is than to dedicate a show to all your questions.

In this show, I will answer questions regarding exercise induced asthma, suntan lotions with exceptionally high SPF&#039;s, the accuracy of blood pressure machines in drug stores and the difference between decaf and regular tea.

<p>Cycling is a great way for people who have no spare time to fit some physical activity into their daily schedule.   And with the price of gas going up, using a bicycle for small shopping trips, commuting, visiting friends or just for the joy of the ride, may help your pocketbook at the same time as it improves your physical condition.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why today, I&#8217;m going to go over the health benefits of cycling, the importance of choosing a properly fitted bike and tips on how to be safe on the road.</p>

<p>I have some exciting news to share with you today!   I am taking my passion for health and helping others to the next level.  In June I will be coming out with a weekly video podcast in addition to the weekly audio podcast.  The video promo will be coming out this Sunday, so look for it and enjoy.  I am very excited to bring Being Healthy TV to you this year!</p>
<p>This is going to be a great year for Being Healthy TV, so make sure to partake of the new video goodness.   I promise you won&#8217;t regret it!   Now on to the show!</p>
<p>When many of us think about losing weight, we automatically think that we need to shun carbohydrates in favor of high protein foods because we heard that sugar is fattening.  But do carbohydrates actually make you fat?</p>
<p>Since carbohydrates have so often been debated when it comes to health, I thought it would be helpful to clear a few things up today.   In this show, I am going to discuss exactly what a carbohydrate is, what types of carbohydrates are best and whether carbohydrates will make you fat.</p>

<p>By the weather outside I can say that spring is definitely here and that summer is just around the corner.  The weather is warmer and the days are longer.  This is the time of year, where a lot of people shed their cold weather clothes and step out of their caves to enjoy the outdoors.</p>
<p>Once outside, the warm weather beckons many people to the beach or poolside to worship the sun and be rewarded with a tan.  And who could blame them?  The sun feels so good on our skin.  Plus, many people think a tan gives them an attractive, healthy look.  But is a tan really a sign of health or are we just fooling ourselves?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s really the latter.  In this show, I am going to discuss why a suntan is unhealthy, the dangers of getting too much sun and tips on how to minimize harmful sun exposure while still enjoying the nice weather.</p>

<p>Do you constantly think about food, find yourself eating when you aren&#8217;t hungry or when you are depressed?   Do you eat in secret or eat much healthier in the company of others than when you are alone?   Do you feel guilty right after eating?   Do you continue to go to the all you can eat buffets even though the reading on the scale keeps rising?   If you said yes to any of these these, you may have a food addiction.</p>
<p>Since many people have some degree of food addiction, in this show I thought it would be useful to go over what makes a person a food addict, and give some tips and strategies to help break the addiction.</p>

<p>It is that time of year again, where many of us start planning our next vacation.  Vacations are a welcome break from the stress and monotony of work.   They&#8217;re an opportunity to rest and recharge from the stresses of everyday life.  Plus, they don&#8217;t have to be expensive, if that&#8217;s a concern for you.   With the economy being the way it is, many people are choosing to go camping or are going on long road trips instead of flying.</p>
<p>In this show, I discuss why it is important to eat healthy on vacation and I also give tips on how to eat healthy while camping or while on long road trips.</p>
<p><span id="more-251"></span></p>
<p>Here are the recipe links I mentioned that were given to me by Adrian Bertolini, my friend from Argentina who inspired the camping portion of the show: <a href="http://www.scoutorama.com/recipe/">scoutoram.com</a>, <a href="http://www.usscouts.org/macscouter/Cooking/">usscouts.org</a> and <a href="http://www.boyscouttrail.com/boy-scouts/boy-scout-recipes.asp">boyscouttrail.com</a>.</p>
<p>For those people who want to know how to eat healthy at restaurants, please go back and listen to <a href="http://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/diningout/">show 28</a>, where I cover that topic.</p>
<p>Some references I used while researching this show are <a href="http://camping.every1loves2travel.com/">camping.every1loves2travel.com</a> and <a href="http://nutrition.about.com/od/foodfun/a/healthyeating.htm">nutrition.about.com</a>.</p>

<p>In some ways, your brain functions like a muscle.   If you don&#8217;t use it, you lose it.   If you train it though, it works better.  The more you challenge your brain, the better you are able to process and remember information and the better your memory is.   So, if you think you have poor memory, there is still hope.   You can take steps to improve it.</p>
<p>This episode is the second part of a two part series on memory.   For those of you that are new to this podcast, make sure to download and listen to last week&#8217;s show, <a href="http://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/bh4bp0037/">#37</a> first.  In this show, I will give you tips and strategies to sharpen your mind and improve your memory.</p>

In some ways, your brain functions like a muscle.   If you don&#039;t use it, you lose it.   If you train it though, it works better.  The more you challenge your brain, the better you are able to process and remember information and the better your memory is.   So, if you think you have poor memory, there is still hope.   You can take steps to improve it.

This episode is the second part of a two part series on memory.   For those of you that are new to this podcast, make sure to download and listen to last week&#039;s show, #37 (http://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/bh4bp0037/) first.  In this show, I will give you tips and strategies to sharpen your mind and improve your memory.



Other episodes referenced in the podcast are:

	* Dealing with Stress: Parts 1 and 2 (Shows #31 (http://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/stress_part_1/) and #32 (http://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/bh4bp0032/))
	* Trouble Sleeping? (Show #15 (http://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/bh4bp0015/))

Some references I used while researching this show are The New Wellness Encyclopedia, www.fi.edu  (http://www.fi.edu/learn/brain/exercise.html) and helpguide.org (http://www.helpguide.org/life/improving_memory.htm).

<p>Our culture is obsessed with weight.   It seems that every person has a bathroom scale in their house and many people weigh themselves as part of their daily routine.  Any weight gain is perceived as a change for the worse.   And the media doesn&#8217;t make it any better.

<p>But we need to change the way we think about our bodies.   It is important to make weight loss goals reasonable.  The most important thing is to be healthy, not to look like a model.  Those models might look healthy, but on the inside, many of them are not really that healthy.</p>

<p>This week we are going to do something different with the show.   A few weeks ago on <a title="Show #26" href="ttp://www.beinghealthy.tv/archives/talli_journey/">Show #26</a>, I talked about my journey to becoming healthier.   That show got a really positive response, so I thought that it would be interesting to all of you if I interviewed a guest occasionally and discussed how they fit being healthy into their busy life.</p>
<p>In this show, I interviewed Tee Morris who is an author, podcaster and an <em><strong>extremely</strong></em> busy person.  We discussed some of the challenges Tee faced on his journey to becoming healthier and how he met them.</p>
<p>Here are the best places to find out more about Tee Morris and all the wonderful things that he does:</p>

<p>Today&#8217;s episode is the first in a two part series about stress.   Now is an appropriate time for this topic because these are tough and stressful times for many people.   Unemployment is up, home foreclosures are high and the stock market is way down.   Some people have lost their jobs and others are worried that they might lose theirs. There are a lot of people worrying about whether they can continue to pay their bills and mortgages.</p>
<p>In this show, I discuss what stress is, describe some unhealthy coping behaviors, talk about why it is important to manage stress in a healthy manner and explain how exercise plays an important role in relieving stress.</p>

<p>I know it seems like everywhere you go, people are telling you the healthiest thing you can do is to go vegetarian.  I also know that many of you enjoy a nice, juicy steak or hamburger once in a while and don&#8217;t plan to give it up anytime soon. Others are vegetarians or vegans who often enjoy a tasty meatless substitute, such as meatless chicken, meatless beef or meatless turkey. However, whether you choose to eat meat or meat substitutes, not all options are created equal.  Just because it doesn&#8217;t have meat in it, doesn&#8217;t mean that it is healthy.</p>
<p>In this show, I am going to delve into the world of beef, for you meat lovers, and the meatless meat world, for you veggie lovers.  I am going to discuss what is healthy and what is not so healthy to consume.</p>

<p>A lot of people either don&#8217;t like to or feel they don&#8217;t have the time to cook or wash dishes.  After a busy day at work followed by taking the kids to all their activities, the thought of cooking on top of all that seems like too much.  Sometimes, we need a reprieve from our daily work and dining out is one way of getting that.  The problem is that if we resort to eating out too often, our health can suffer due to the predominantly unhealthy food that is available at many restaurants.   But, while eating out is almost always less healthy than preparing your own food, your healthy diet doesn&#8217;t have to go out the window when you go out to eat.  You can still eat healthy when dining out, if you make better choices.</p>
<p>So, in this show, I discuss ways to have healthy meals when eating out.   I go over breakfast, lunch and dinner and some general guidelines when dining out.</p>

<p>I end the show with a voicemail from Megan from <a title="podcastjunky.com" href="http://www.podcastjunky.com">podcastjunky.com</a> and <a title="meanmommiesclub.com" href="http://www.meanmommiesclub.com">meanmommiesclub.com</a> about how to get kids to eat properly on a vegetarian diet.  For more information on this subject, check out the <a title="Mayo Clinic" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vegetarian-diet/HQ01596 ">Mayo Clinic</a> article.</p>

<p>Many people out there are always searching for the fountain of youth. They&#8217;re looking for ways that they can stay young, stop the aging process or prevent disease.  Americans spend billions of dollars every year on magic potions, miracle pills or expensive surgeries to stop or hopefully reverse the aging process.

<p>Happy New Year, everyone!  This podcast comes out on New Year&#8217;s Day, which is the time of year when many of us reflect on the year that has passed and make our resolutions for the year ahead.  Since the journey to being healthier seems difficult to a lot of people, I thought that while I was reflecting on how far I&#8217;d come, it would be a fitting time to share with you the story of my journey to better health. That way, you can see how I got to where I am today because, believe it or not, I wasn&#8217;t born like this.<br />
<span id="more-139"></span><br />
So, in this show, I discuss my life&#8217;s progression to healthier eating. I start with my childhood, then discuss my college years, then the changes after starting work and getting married and on to the present. </p>

<p>For many, alcohol is considered a pleasurable and even essential part of any party or gathering.   Luckily, alcohol does have some health benefits when consumed in “moderation” (moderation is the key word here).  However, people often take drinking too far during parties and wake up with a hangover the next day.  When consumed in excess like this and on a regular basis, alcohol becomes toxic to our bodies and adversely effects our health.  And that is what we don&#8217;t want!</p>

<p>The holidays are upon us and the food and sweets are coming at a fast and furious pace.   A lot of us during this time of year indulge ourselves in foods that are rich in saturated fats and cholesterol, like eggnog, cold-cuts, ham, turkey, pies and sugar cookies to name a few.</p>
<p>For someone who has elevated cholesterol levels, this might be a difficult time of year.   Now, more than ever, it is important to watch what we eat, especially if we are worried about our blood cholesterol levels.   In this show, I discuss what cholesterol is, where it comes from and ways to control or lower your cholesterol levels.</p>

<p>In the last few shows we&#8217;ve talked about the importance of eating healthy breakfasts, lunches and dinners.  What haven&#8217;t we talked about yet? Snacks.</p>
<p>Almost everyone eats snacks between meals, including myself.  It is nothing to be ashamed of, if done right.  Actually, it might even help some of us lose weight, by preventing us from binging on food during mealtimes.  In this show, I discuss the negatives of certain common snacks and how to choose healthier ones.</p>

<p>Next, I jump right into the show.  On last week&#8217;s show, I talked about ways that you could eat a healthy lunch,  despite your busy schedule.  This week I concentrate on preparing healthy dinners.  Dinner tends to be the biggest and most important meal of the day for many people.  That is why it is so important to eat a healthy meal that is not full of sodium, fat and cholesterol.  In this show, I help you find ways to prepare a healthy dinner.  I discuss ways you can reduce your intake of sodium, sugar and fat while increasing your intake of vitamins, minerals and fiber.</p>

So, please head on over to <a title="podcastawards.com" href="http://www.podcastawards.com">podcastawards.com</a> to vote for this podcast. Thank you so much for your support!</p>
<p>Next, I jump right into the show.  A lot of us are trying to lose weight and are looking for ways to help us lose those excess pounds. But, some of the things that we believe are helpful, actually don&#8217;t work at all. In this show, I discuss 15 common myths related to weight loss in depth. Some references that I used were <a title="webmd.com" href="http://www.webmd.com/digestive-disorders/features/nine-surprising-facts-about-your-stomach ">webmd.com</a> and <a title="abclocal.go.com" href="http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/food_coach&amp;id=6334454">abclocal.go.com</a>.</p>
<p><span id="more-80"></span></p>
<p>For those of you that want to hear a little different side of me or who want to listen to a great personal podcast, I was interviewed on Tuesday, October 14th by Erk for the Erk Pod podcast. I really enjoyed being on the show and had a fun time being interviewed by Erk and discussing health issues with him. A couple of times we had a little trouble understanding each other because of Skype, but it is a really good listen. For anyone who is interested I recommend you check it out at <a title="erkpod.com.au" href="http://erkpod.wordpress.com/2008/10/15/erk-pod-147-erk-gets-serious-and-educated-at-the-same-time-interview-with-talli-van-sunder/">erkpod.com.au</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">This show sponsored by: <a href="http://www.nmteaco.com/?AffId=1">New Mexico Tea Company</a></p>
<p>This show is dedicated to the wonderful world of tea. After water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage around the world. In this show, I discuss in great depth the four main &#8220;true&#8221; teas: <em>White tea, Green tea, Oolong tea</em> and <em>Black tea</em>. They are called true teas because they are all harvested from the same tea plant, Camilla Sinensis whereas other teas aren&#8217;t.<br />
<span id="more-55"></span><br />
I go over where these teas are mainly produced, how they are processed, what they taste like, some of their varieties and how to make a perfect cup of that tea. I also lightly touch on how herbal teas differ from true teas. Some references that I used were <a title="Wikipeda" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea">Wikipedia</a>, <a title="about.com" href="http://coffeetea.about.com/od/typesoftea/a/whitetea.htm">about.com</a> and <a title="oolongtea.org" href="http://www.oolongtea.org/e/">oolongtea.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you like the show, please head on over to <a title="iTunes" href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=285124681">iTunes</a> and give me a nice review.

This show is dedicated to the wonderful world of tea. After water, tea is the most widely consumed beverage around the world. In this show, I discuss in great depth the four main &quot;true&quot; teas: White tea, Green tea, Oolong tea and Black tea. They are called true teas because they are all harvested from the same tea plant, Camilla Sinensis whereas other teas aren&#039;t.

I go over where these teas are mainly produced, how they are processed, what they taste like, some of their varieties and how to make a perfect cup of that tea. I also lightly touch on how herbal teas differ from true teas. Some references that I used were Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea), about.com (http://coffeetea.about.com/od/typesoftea/a/whitetea.htm) and oolongtea.org (http://www.oolongtea.org/e/).

If you like the show, please head on over to iTunes (http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=285124681) and give me a nice review. It’s a great way to give me some good exposure and can help me get more listeners. Thanks for listening everyone!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, I start off the show by discussing whether the Wii Fit can actually get you fit. The Wii Fit is an exercise video game made by Nintendo for the Wii console. I go over what the Wii fit entails: the equipment used, what is measured and the exercise options available. Then I delve into the advantages and disadvantages of this game by referencing a review done by <a title="CNET" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/wii-games/wii-fit-wii/4505-9993_7-32513029.html">CNET</a> on the Wii Fit.<br />

<p>Next, I move on to talking about the importance of eating breakfast.  Since you are busy, I give you six tips to make your mornings easier, so that you are able to include breakfast in your morning routine.</p>
<p>I end the show with a comment from Dave and a mention of my guest post on Mark Salinas&#8217; <a title="Healthy Living Today" href="http://blog.marksalinas.com/2008/08/31/talli-van-sunder-and-omega-3-fatty-acids/#comments">Healthy Living Today</a> website.</p>

<p>Next, I move on to talking about the negative effects of consuming too much salt in your diet.  I also give a few tips on how you can decrease the amount of sodium in your food.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As promised on show #5, I start this week&#8217;s show discussing some abdominal exercises that you can do in the comfort of your own home.  I look at the traditional crunch, the bicycle crunch and the abdominal crunch on the exercise ball.<br />
<span id="more-30"></span></p>
<p>Then I head into the meat of the show by talking about whether sunscreens actually protect us from harmful UV radiation. I reference articles from <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Sunscreen#Sunscreen_cancer_issue">Wikipedia</a>, <a title="Environmental Working Group" href="http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/special/sunscreens2008/summary.php">Environmental Working Group</a> and <a title="lawsuitsearch.com" href="http://www.lawsuitsearch.com/news/other-lawsuits/sunscreen_lawsuit_deceptive_sales_sy.aspx">lawsuitsearch.com</a>.</p>
<p>After that I go into discussing the importance of food journals for individuals looking to lose weight and/or incorporate healthier eating habits.  Food journals are tools that help you make a habit of thinking about what you eat before you eat it.</p>
<p>I end the show by discussing how smoking adversely affects your health.  To illustrate my point, I mention some smoking statistics that I found on <a title="hubpages.com" href="http://hubpages.com/hub/dangersofsmoking">hubpages.com</a> and <a title="quitsmoking.com" href="http://quitsmoking.about.com/od/tobaccostatistics/a/tobaccofacts.htm">quitsmoking.com</a>.</p>

<p>Then I head into the meat of the show and discuss a new popular fad diet, called the Flat Belly Diet. This diet was created by the editors of Prevention Magazine.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this week&#8217;s show, I concentrate on the topic of stress, especially related to work and being in debt. I start off discussing what stress is and how it can be damaging to our bodies. I reference an article from the <a title="American Institute of Stress" href="http://www.stress.org/americas.htm">American Institute of Stress</a> when talking about this topic.<br />
<span id="more-24"></span></p>
<p>Then I jump into my next topic related to stress, which is how to manage stress on the job. I look at an article from <a title="www.helpguide.org" href="http://www.helpguide.org/mental/work_stress_management.htm ">helpguide.org</a> about stress management.</p>
<p>Finally, I conclude the show by looking at an article from <a title="www.msnbc.com" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25060719/">msnbc.com</a> related to how debt stress can affect your health. I recommend people who have debt listen to another great podcast called <a title="Millionaire or Bust" href="http://www.millionaireorbust.com">Millionaire or Bust</a> to help them find ways to decrease or get rid of their debt, because no debt is synonymous with less stress and better health.</p>
