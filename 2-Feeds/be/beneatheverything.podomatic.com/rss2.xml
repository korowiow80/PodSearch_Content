      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1230958/600x600_6159153.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this weeks show felt so super interactive. so many people mentioned us on Twitter during the recording. got a considerable amount of hits to the blog by people wanting to see wtf was going on. it was a crazy blast. so much fun. im drunk as well...i even spelled most of my tweets correctly...first time for everything. this week we had Wendy Summers on the show. we had to do two versions of the interview because it got a bit sticky. so above is the censored version and below is the #NSFW version. we played a lot fo good stuff, all pick by you the listeners. wow! another week is over...time to get back to the drawing board and whip out another for y'all. thank you all for the support &amp; i hope you enjoy the podcast as much as i did recording it. tell a friend too

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1230958/600x600_6159153.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for the sake of this conversation, i'd like it if you would think of me as being amazing. like i could fly or some shit. this weeks show may not of been filled with a grip of cool things but i believe this might be the best show i did today. seriously. this week we had the band Automatic Toys on. for some reason when i type &quot;automatic&quot; i want to put a space after &quot;auto&quot; backspace button you are so helpful. i got ripped and fielded a few twitter questions during the inbox. i also even delt with what might have been an attempt to make things better, but im not to sure that did the job. i may be able to get drunk enough to do some seriously &quot;f'd&quot; up stuff but i have limits. time will tell. i know one thing though. things have changed indeed. for the better idk but the show felt very cathartic to say the least. next week will be the true test. this weeks show was fun. i hope you enjoy it as much as i did recording it. enjoy!</description>
