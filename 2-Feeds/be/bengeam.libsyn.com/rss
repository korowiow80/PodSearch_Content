        <description><![CDATA[TWIG - The Word Is Grace is brought to you by The Carpenter's Shop, located at 1201 East Elmore Street in Crawfordsville, Indiana. Our Sabbath services begin at 3:30 every Saturday afternoon. Listen with us as Bible teachers Jim Denman and Tim Terry examine our faith in Messiah Yeshua (Christ Jesus), with a Hebraic perspective. What did Jesus eat? How did He dress? Is the Torah still valid to believers today? Did He really say that there are only two laws that we have to follow now? Did God change His requirements for salvation after the cross? Is the Sabbath on Sunday or Saturday; was it changed? Join us as we seek answers to these questions, with balance and a humble reverence for God's Word.

			<title>One Law for the Native-Born and the Stranger - Parsha 54 with Haftarah</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thewordisgrace.com/one-law-for-the-native-born-and-the-stranger-parsha-54-with-haftarah]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp; There was a "mixed multitude" who came out of the land of Egypt. It wasn't just Hebrews who made the journey out of the land. There were foreigners, sojourners, and Israelites who came out. The Passover&nbsp; was to be observed by the "entire congregation of Israel." The stranger had to do something first though - he was to get circumcised, and<em> come near. </em>Just like Ruth, they had to make Israel's people their people, and Israel's God their God.</p>
<p>&nbsp; We believe that the Word of God is very clear in telling us that we have responsibilities as believers - we have a standard of righteousness that we are expected to live by. Please, <em>don't misunderstand what I am saying; we can not do anything to secure our own salvatio</em>n, nor can we become 'more saved' by obeying the instructions of Torah. We believe that we are to obey Torah<em> because we are saved. </em>As 'grafted in' people, we agree with Paul when he tells us that we are not supporting the root, but the root (Israel) supports us (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2011:16-18&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">Rom 11:18</a>). We have the same life-source, which is Torah; God's Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Most of us are <em>not </em>Native Born Israelites; but we can "<em>be as the Native Born."</em> All it requires is for us to draw near to God the Father through Messiah. His ways become our ways. His poeple become our people. His Father becomes our Father. We get adopted by Hashem, and as an adopted child of the God of Israel, doesn't it make sense that we would be expected to follow the instructions given to the Native Born? Not to be a child of God... <em>but because we are.</em></p>

			<title>Concerning Our Father Abraham - Parsha 53 with Haftorah</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thewordisgrace.com/concerning-our-father-abraham-parsha-53-with-haftorah]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning Father Abraham...<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp; We all know the song; "Father Abraham had many sons, many sons had Father Abraham. I am one of them, and so are you, so let's just praise the Lord" Most of us sang it in Sunday school when we were children, but have you ever thought about the message of those words? We know that the scriptures say that we are considered the 'Seed of Abraham' but do we actually know what that means? Do we live our lives as the Seed of Abraham? In <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%208:37-40&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">John 8:39</a>, Jesus was speaking to the men who claimed Abraham as their father. The conversation went like this; <span>&nbsp;</span>'<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%208:37-40&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">"Abraham is our father," they answered; and Jesus replied, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do the things Abraham did.</a>' The obvious question then is, '<em>what did Abraham do</em>'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When we look at the life of Abraham, what sticks out the most is his believing, and it being accounted to him as righteousness. Abraham simply believed, and God called it righteousness! What a witness to all of us, who even in 2010 can simply <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%2010:9&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">confess with our mouths, and believe in our hearts, and we will be saved!</a> But wait; don't stop there - keep digging. In <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ge%2026:5&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">Genesis 26:5, Moses writes of Abraham that he followed all of the Laws and statutes of God. </a>How can this be? What does that mean for Gentile believers today? After all, Abraham wasn't a Jew, but a Gentile. A 'called out' Gentile; just like us. It's no wonder he is used as our example so many times throughout the apostolic writings!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next couple weeks, we will be discussing why we believe commandments and the Festivals of the bible, starting with Passover are for Christians today; and what it means to be the "Seed of Abraham."</p>

			<title>Jacob Adopts Two Gentiles? (Parsha) - Gen 48:1 - 48:26</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome back to The Word Is Grace! We have been gone for a while, so let&rsquo;s get caught up. For starters, due to some technical difficulties, we have been rather quiet on the Internet for a few weeks, but we are back now. However, we will not be going straight into the second book of Thessalonians just yet. This week, we are going to pick up in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2048:1%20-%2049:26&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">Genesis 48:1 - 49:26</a>. For those of you on who are familiar with the Triennial Parsha Cycle, you will notice that this portions is from a few weeks back - August 28th to be exact, and taught by Aaron Benge.&nbsp; We will also be posting the haftarah and Apostolic portions as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This week, we will see Jacob blessing his sons, and adopting Joseph&rsquo;s sons, Ephraim and Manasseh. Like Gentile followers of Yeshua today, they are grafted into Israel. As heirs, Ephraim and Manasseh are expected to follow the God of Israel (Jacob), their adoptive father. His rules are their rules; his God is their God. Just like the natural born sons of Israel, they are expected to live, talk, eat, dress, and act a certain way. Are we any different? The mainstream thought is that we are very different! We strongly disagree. As followers of Messiah, the Messiah of Israel, the Son of the God of Israel, we believe that just as the expectations of Jacob&rsquo;s adopted sons are the same as his &ldquo;true&rdquo; sons, so too are our expectations the same as those laid out in the Torah for God&rsquo;s people. That is why we obey His Torah instructions! Not to be saved... but because we are.</p>

			<title>Community Or Congregation... That Is The Question - 1 Thess 5:12-28</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thewordisgrace.com/community-or-congregation-that-is-the-question-1-thess-5-12-28]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As we wrap up the book of 1 Thessalonians, some pretty difficult topics come up. First, those who are leaders in the body of Christ are accountable for their actions, and those who are not leaders are required to call out false teaching, and sin that may show up; which includes when it is found within leadership. Second, but certainly not last, we, as the body need to make up our minds as to whether or not we are a community or a congregation. What's the difference, you might ask? A congregation goes to church each week, and when their brother or sister in the LORD starts to make poor decisions, the mindset of the congregation is to let the Pastor deal with it - stay out o fit for the sake of not hurting feelings. A person in a community goes to the person with the problem in love and gets involved. A community looks out for the community members. If you are sitting there thinking, &ldquo;that sure sounds like the pastor's job&hellip;&rdquo; then you may have a congregational mindset. We, as sheep in the same flock should at the very least bleat when we see trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where are you today? Is your church simply a place where you show up each week, without really investing in the lives of those who go there, or is it truly your family? As 'Messianic,' or 'Hebrew Roots' believers, are we looking out for our brothers and sisters? Even if you are not yet convinced that we are to be obeying Torah - are you? Are we, as followers of Messiah Yeshua, Jesus Christ, investing in the lives of the men, women and children that make up our community?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp; Welcome back to The Word Is Grace! For those of you who listen to the podcast on a regular basis, I would like to apologize for the sparse uploads. This summer has been a time for family trips, and in Tim&rsquo;s case, heavy duty farming. We are currently between the books of 1<sup>st</sup> and 2nd Thessalonians, and will not start with the latter for another two weeks or so. I didn&rsquo;t want to insert teachings that are off topic between the books, and have chosen rather to put one up every two to three weeks instead. If you would rather I fill the gaps with topical, or weekly Torah portion teachings, please let me know in the Comments section below.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp; </span>Having said that, this week we are in the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thess%204:17%20-%205:12&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">fifth chapter of Thessalonians,</a> and Paul is going to use the word &ldquo;harpazo.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;ve never heard the word haprazo, it is the Greek word that is usually translated &ldquo;rapture.&rdquo; We know that Paul mentions our being raptured, and he speaks of the Day of the LORD, but what was he bringing these things up for? Was he teaching deep doctrine about what to expect when the LORD comes back? &hellip;Not exactly. Paul was reassuring the Thessalonians, who were going through serious tribulations. He was comforting them because some were beginning to believe that they may have missed the return of Messiah! Things were <em>so bad</em> that they thought that they were experiencing the tribulations of the last days. When this important fact is taken into account, the meaning behind Paul&rsquo;s message becomes a little clearer. Paul didn&rsquo;t intend to lay out new theology concerning the coming of the LORD; in fact, he reminds them that he already went over those things when he was with them. He was comforting them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp; </span>The whole idea of the rapture has been blown out of proportion in the church today. Paul was referring to a gathering together of God&rsquo;s people; to meet Him in the clouds&hellip; but not to stay there! We will be gathered together. We will meet Him in the clouds. We will be with Him forever, but not in &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; as we have heard it mentioned for so long. There will be new heavens and a new earth. A new earth where our King, Messiah Yeshua will rule and reign form the throne of David.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>In that Day, the graves will open up, the dead will rise, we will meet Him in the air, and forever be with Him in hea-&hellip;<em>&nbsp; Israel</em>? &hellip;But I thought we were going to forever be with Jesus in <em>heaven</em>! Well, not exactly. That is if you are going by the scriptural account of His coming.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ezekiel says (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel%2047:22-23&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">Ezekiel 47:22-23</a>) that the sojourners will have a portion Israel&rsquo;s inheritance &ndash; even to the point of being able to choose which tribe they want to be joined with. Guess what&hellip; we are the sojourners! Those of us who are in Messiah Yeshua are going to choose our tribe &lsquo;in that day.&rsquo; It sort of makes you wonder if we will all choose Judah, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the very least, let this week&rsquo;s podcast challenge you in your thinking about the afterlife. Where will we go? Will we all have harps and halos, floating around on clouds; or will we end up forever being with Yeshua, the King of kings who will rule and reign from the throne of David in Jerusalem? You might be surprised at what the bible has to say.</p>

			<title>Let’s Talk About Sex – 1 Thes 4:1-12</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thewordisgrace.com/let-s-talk-about-sex-1-thes-4-1-12]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:View>Normal</w:View> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:Compatibility> <w:BreakWrappedTables /> <w:SnapToGridInCell /> <w:WrapTextWithPunct /> <w:UseAsianBreakRules /> </w:Compatibility> <w:BrowserLevel>MicrosoftInternetExplorer4</w:BrowserLevel> </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[endif]--></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirty years ago, sex was not talked about in public &ndash; and especially not in church. Sex was thought of as a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; subject; far too taboo for the pulpit. In a lot of ways, sex was viewed as a result of The Fall. Within the confines of marriage, these views could not be further from the truth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>God made sex. He made it exclusively for a husband and wife. Within the confines of marriage, sex is a good and healthy thing.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have a twisted view of sex today. We look at homosexuality and broken marriages as if they were normal, and in a sense they are, as far as the world is concerned. We, as the bride of Messiah should not allow the world&rsquo;s view of sex infiltrate our communities. It is only because of wickedness in man&rsquo;s heart that sexual immorality can become the norm in a society. The &ldquo;normal-ness&rdquo; that our society attaches to homosexuality or adultery is not new to our generation. Quite the contrary is true! Many a great nation has fallen due to sexual sin. Paul warns the people of Thessalonica that they &ldquo;&hellip;should abstain from sexual immorality.&rdquo; He tells them that it is the will of God for them to be sanctified &ndash; we are to be set apart from the world. We, as disciples of Yeshua should be different! If we are taking on the opinion of the world where sexual relations are concerned, we are in trouble. Remember, that we are the bride of Messiah &ndash; and we owe it to our Messiah to be spotless before Him when He comes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20thess%203&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank"> </a></span><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20thess%203&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">In chapter 3 of 1 Thessalonians</a>, Paul states that he is very concerned for the people of Thessalonica. We know that there were very serious troubles for believers in his day. <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=act%2015:18-21&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">In Acts chapter 15, James makes the statement, &ldquo;&hellip;For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in  every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.&rdquo; </a>James is implying that the believers are expected to go to the synagogue each Sabbath to continue to learn Torah. The synagogue was where the people of Thessalonica were meeting the most opposition. Paul may be alluding to the fact that the Thessalonians were being persecuted, and driven out of the synagogues; after all, we know that the leadership of the Thessalonian synagogue was hostile toward Paul, and those teaching in the name of Yeshua.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&nbsp; </span>In America, we are blessed, in that we don&rsquo;t suffer too much affliction for our beliefs. We live in an &lsquo;anything goes&rsquo; society for the most part. Of course,, things may not, and most likely will not always be that way. Yeshua Himself said that we are &ldquo;going to have tribulations,&rdquo; <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2016:33&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">(John 16:33) </a>and we, today, are no exception. Persecution is more than likely coming to a town near you. Are you ready? Do we have the right frame of mind to make it through? Do we stand on a firm enough foundation to withstand it? Revelation &hellip;&hellip;&hellip; says that those who make it through are those who have the testimony of Jesus Christ... and keep His commandments (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev%2012:17&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">Rev 12:17</a>, <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev%2014:12&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">Rev 14:12</a>).</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span>We must, like Paul says in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20thess%203:13&amp;version=NKJV" target="_blank">1 Thess 3:13 allow Him to &ldquo;establish [our] hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at  the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.</a>&rdquo; Let this be an encouragement to you all! Our King is coming back, and we are going to forever be with Him.</p>
