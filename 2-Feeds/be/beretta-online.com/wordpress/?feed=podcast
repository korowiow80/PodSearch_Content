		<itunes:summary>Here it is, the last podcast episode for 2011. This time I&#8217;m looking at &#8220;the &#8220;evil god challenge&#8221; as posed by Stephen Law in a fairly recent article by that name. Isn&#8217;t the evidence for a good God really no better or worse than the evidence that an evil god? In short, no. Here I explain why I think (as I suspect many may think) that the evil god challenges has major philosophical shortcomings, in spite of being an argument worthy of our attention.

		<itunes:summary>This episode is a very late addition to the series &#8220;In Search of the Soul,&#8221; looking at the various options that exist in philosophy of mind. In the original five part series I was very conscious of the fact that I was leaving out the view of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, and this addendum is my penance for that fact. As promised in the episode, here are just a few suggestions for further reading, from authors who defend &#8220;hylemorphic dualism.&#8221;
David Oderberg, Real Essentialism
David Oderberg, &#8220;Hylemorphic Dualism&#8221; in Ellen Paul, Fred Miller and Jeffrey Paul (eds), Personal Identity
Edward Feser, Philosophy of Mind: A Beginner&#8217;s Guide

		<itunes:summary>Episode 42 presents the âminimal factsâ approach to the resurrection of Jesus.
This episode doesnât just present the argument in order to persuade you, itâs also meant to show you what the argument is like so that you can use it yourself (if you find it persuasive of course). It starts out with four facts granted by the majority of New Testament critics, and then works towards an explanation of those facts.
In this episode I refer to other blog posts and podcast episodes, and as promised here are links to those:
Merry Mithras!
Episode 19:Â Osiris and Jesus
 Is there No Evidence that Jesus Even Existed?
 Is there No Evidence that Jesus Even Exited?Â Part 2
 Is there No Evidence that Jesus Even Exited? Part 3

		<itunes:summary>NOTE: In this episode I call it episode 40. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s episode 39.
The podcast is back. Actually, episode 39 was going to be on another topic, but then someone suggested this one to me, so as I already had a document called &#8220;episode 039&#8243; I called this &#8220;document 040.&#8221; And then when I started recording it I thought &#8211; &#8220;Hey, this is the 40th episode. Cool!&#8221; and I made a big deal of it in the recording. And then after I uploaded it I realised that since I skipped over the episode 39 that I&#8217;m writing, this isn&#8217;t really 40 at all, it&#8217;s episode 39! So that was an epic fail.
So no sooner do I release another podcast episode, I am making excuses for it! This episode is based on a lecture on divine command ethics that I gave a few years ago. Enjoy!

Here&#8217;s episode 36, in honour of the recent retirement of Alvin Plantinga as the John O&#8217;Brien Professor of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. It&#8217;s sort of a &#8220;nuts and bolts&#8221; podcast episode on Alvin Plantinga, introducing the listener to his account of belief in God as a properly basic belief &#8211; a belief justifiably held, but not held on the basis of evidence or argument.
Enjoy.

		<itunes:summary>Episode 35 is an analysis of a recent talk given by Sam Harris on science and human values. The talk was part of a TED conference, and you can see part 1 here. Harris thinks that he has argued that moral facts are actually scientific facts. I think he has failed, and here I offer an explanation of how I think he has failed. In brief, I think his entire presentation is an exercise in circular reasoning.
Harris has a new book on the subject, The Moral Landscape, which is to be released later this year. If you&#8217;d like to order a copy, please use this link and the Book Depository will look kindly on me.

		<itunes:summary>Time to go to Sunday School. I was prompted to write this one just because the doctrine of original sin is one that I have never personally heard a sermon on in all the churches that I have attended. Now that&#8217;s not to say that these churches reject the idea, but it does mean that for a lot of Christians, they haven&#8217;t been directly taught about it. I don&#8217;t want to presume to teach people stuff they already know, but at the same time I thought it couldn&#8217;t hurt to do my part to make sure that Christians actually understand their theological heritage. So here&#8217;s my take on the doctrine of original sin.

		<itunes:summary>Here&#8217;s the fourth installment onÂ my series on the mind-body problem.
In this episode I look at the argument against physicalism from the afterlife. Here, some dualists argue that if physicalism were true, then the resurrection of the dead would be logically impossible. Their argument is:

The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead entails that people will be raised back to life who are the same people who died long ago. In other words, they will have the same identity.
 Sameness of identity requires unbroken metaphysical continuity (that is, the continued, uninterrupted or ânon-gappyâ existence of whatever thing the functioning person is, whether a physical thing or an immaterial mind).
 In physicalism, it is logically impossible for there to be unbroken metaphysical continuity between a physical person who died a hundred years ago and a person who will be raised to life in the future.
 Therefore if physicalism is true, the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead is logically impossible. Stated differently, a physicalist cannot consistently believe in the resurrection of the dead.

How might a physicalist respond to this line of argument? Listen to find out. As promised in the episode, here are a few pieces of work by Trenton Merricks that relate to some of the material I cover:
&#8220;How to Live Forever Without Saving your Soul,&#8221; in Kevin Corcoran (ed.) Soul, Body, and Survival: Essays on the Metaphysics of Human Persons (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2001), 183-200
&#8220;There Are No Criteria of Identity Over Time,&#8221; NoÃ»s 32:1 (1998), 106-124.
&#8220;The Resurrection of the Body and the Life Everlasting&#8221; in Michael J. Murray (ed.), Reason for the Hope Within (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1999), 261-286.
Enjoy.

Think of this as a consolation prize while I (very slowly) finish the next episode in the series In Search of the Soul. Hey, if you want me to get these things done faster, then hire me.

		<itunes:summary>This episode is a recording of a talk I gave last week at the University of Canterbury on abortion.
As promised in the episode, here&#8217;s a summary of some questions and answers that followed.
Q: What would you say about cases like rape or incest, where the women is going to give birth to a reminder of what was done to her?
A: That&#8217;s the hardest type of scenario I think. There are a few kinds of answers I&#8217;d give. Firstly, one thing to bear in mind is that even if I said that I thought that rape was a good enough ground for an abortion, that still only allows a very small number of abortions. The proportion of all abortions in New Zealand where the pregnancy is alleged to have resulted from rape is very small.
Secondly, what would we say to a woman with a two year old son who was born because she was raped, if she said that she was going to kill her son because he reminded her of the rape? Although we might feel sorry for her and want to help her in some way, we wouldn&#8217;t think it was alright to kill the child. So it seems to me that the idea that it&#8217;s alright to kill the unborn child in these cases is trading on the fact that we have a tendency not to be as aware of the status of the unborn child, or the moral factors that I&#8217;ve discussed when I gave reasons for deeming abortion immoral. Because the unborn child is , so to speak &#8220;out of sight, out of mind,&#8221; on a psychological and emotional level we don&#8217;t form the same attachment to it, so it&#8217;s easy for us to see why killing the two year old is wrong but to at least partly overlook or not notice that wrongness in the case of abortion.
Sometimes when wrong things are done to a person (like rape), there&#8217;s no defensible way out of it, even when that involves suffering. That may sound a little harsh, but let me put it this way: Let&#8217;s not punish the son for the sins committed by the father. The fact that something terrible was done to you doesn&#8217;t give you right to do absolutely whatever it takes to get out of that situation, like by deflecting that harm so that someone else bears the brunt of it, which is what happens when we kill the unborn to alleviate the emotional pain inflicted on the woman.
Q: In your talk you refer to a fetus. Would you go further? Would your argument also apply to an embryo?
It would, yes. there&#8217;s no logical reason for it not to. I am numerically identical with an embryo that once lived. The only reason that I refer to a fetus in this talk is that most abortions in New Zealand take place from 8 to 12 weeks&#8217; gestation, which just happens to be in the fetal stage.
Q:You say that abortion should be illegal. Do you think people who carry out abortion should be punished for murder, in the same way a murderer would be?
I don&#8217;t know. Saying that it should be illegal is not, of course, to say that it should be murder. The law already treats, for example, infanticide as a distinct crime, not because we think it&#8217;s not wrong, but I guess it&#8217;s out of recognition of the psychological factors that might come into play. I think that&#8217;s really a technical legal question. You have to look at all the relevant way one act might compare to another, there are epistemological questions involved of what the people involved could be expected to know and so forth. So I don&#8217;t make any firm claim there. For now I leave that to the lawyers.
ADDENDUM: Although to be clear, I want to say that I lean on the firm rather than lenient side of how serious the repercussions should be.
Q: Some have said that prior to legalisation there were a number of police officers who were willing to accept bribes to look the other way and ignore illegal abortion. So if we make abortion illegal it will increase corruption in the police force. What would you say to that?
A: I think that corruption in the police for is wrong in its own right and needs to be addressed in its own right. This is[...]</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Here it is (at last!), part two of the series on philosophy of mind, In Search of the Soul. In this episode I introduce the viewpoint called emergentism, and I explore the argument for dualism from free will.
It&#8217;s not the most exciting of episodes, but it&#8217;s worth including and listening to if you&#8217;re wanting to get a decent overview of philosophy of mind because it lays out a major position (emergentism) and examines a pretty common argument for dualism. In episode 28 (I&#8217;ve decided that the whole series will be no more than five episodes long), I&#8217;ll look at William Hasker&#8217;s (among other people) objection to physicalism from the possibility of an afterlife, which I think will be a lot more interesting.

		<itunes:summary>In this episode of the Say Hello to my Little Friend podcast I start a four part series on philosophy of mind. I know I recently said that it would be a three part series, but hey, even four parts isn&#8217;t really enough to give the subject the full treatment it deserves. In part one I start with the dualist end of the spectrum. Today it&#8217;s Cartesian/Platonic dualism, which I take to be the most popular variety.
After recording the episode I thought maybe I should have thrown this in, so I&#8217;ll add it here. It&#8217;s a rather witty wee argument offered by Kevin Corcoran in the book that this series gets its name from, In Search of the Soul: Four Views of the Mind-Body Problem. The argument appears in his reply to Cartesian dualist Stewart Goetz:
Stewart Goetz sometimes kisses his wife.
Stewart Goetz&#8217;s substantively simple soul never kisses anyone. (It has no lips!)
Therefore, Stewart Goetz is not a simple soul.
If you&#8217;re not yet familiar with what the term &#8220;simple&#8221; means in this context, listen to the episode, then come back and read Corcoran&#8217;s argument. Also in this episode I have my first ever &#8220;caller,&#8221; Joe Johnson from the &#8220;Watching Theology&#8221; podcast. You too can call into the show by emailing me an audio clip of your comments and questions. Send them to peoples dot glenn at gmail dot com.
Enjoy!

		<itunes:summary>Here it is, the first podcast episode for 2009, complete with my summer hay fever voice! Kicking things off for the year is a discussion of what lies beyond the grave. The resurrection of the dead is the hope of the New Testament for our eternal life, yet popular Christian theology has come to place a lot of weight on the hope of going to heaven when you die. Short story: It has to stop and we need to adjust our focus.

		<itunes:summary>After much delay, here&#8217;s the next episode. This time I&#8217;m discussing the claim that scholars have uncovered Gospels other than Matthew Mark, Luke and John, other Gospels that deserve to stand alongside the four canonical Gospels as having equal historical legitimacy, but which the churchTM has unfairly suppressed in its quest for dominance over the Scripture and what it is permitted to contain. These include the Gospel of Thomas, the Secret Gospel of Mark and others.
It&#8217;s the middle of the night, but some time in the next few days I&#8217;ll edit this post and add the reading list that I promised in this podcast episode.

		<itunes:summary>Is Jesus just Osiris with a new face? In Episode 19 I look at the sceptical argument claiming that Christianity was really just a collection of beliefs borrowed from pagan religions, and that Jesus was just a re-hash of one or many other Messiah or god-man figures. As there would be no way to deal with all of these other religions in one episode, I&#8217;ve chosen to use the example of the ancient Egyptian deity Osiris. In short, the sceptical argument is not particularly well supported by the facts.
HERE is a transcript of this episode.

		<itunes:summary>Here it is, Episode 18. Here I draw on the work of the fourth century bishop of Alexandria, Athanasius. His work called The Incarnation of the Word is my all-time favourite work from the Church Fathers, and I think it gives us excellent theological reasons for adopting annihilationism. Along the way, it invites a theological storm over what it meant for Christ to become subject to death as one of us.
As always, comments are more than welcome. I&#8217;m also on the lookout for someone who might be interested in co-hosting the occasional show with me. Drop me a line if you&#8217;re interested!

		<itunes:summary>It&#8217;s back!
The last month has been pretty crazy for me: changing job and moving house being among the main culprits for this state of affairs. But after much ado, here it is, Episode 15! This time I&#8217;m asking a simple question: Why be an atheist? And if you&#8217;re not one, why become one? And if you are one, why try to persuade other people to become one?
I&#8217;ve started a new trend with this episode. Some previous episodes were just too long for a lot of listeners, so I&#8217;m making a fairly strict rule that episodes shall not exceed forty minutes. This one&#8217;s just under twenty eight minutes, so I&#8217;m off to a good start. Also, I&#8217;ll only be putting episodes up each fortnight rather than weekly, just because I don&#8217;t have quite as much time as I did before &#8211; plus with all these people downloading an episode every week I literally couldn&#8217;t afford the bandwidth!
So here it is, enjoy. As always, comments either here or by email to be discussed on the show are more than welcome. And as always &#8211; subscribe using the iTunes store if you can.

		<itunes:summary>This episode is a sermon/talk that I delivered on Sunday the 27th of July at our church, Grace Bible Church, here in Dunedin, New Zealand.
I was asked to preach on Mark 13, the Olivet Discourse. Yes, the whole thing. In one sermon. That meant I had to be pretty simplistic about it, and I couldn&#8217;t go into a huge amount of depth. It was an introductory talk to an audience that had never really looked at the issue before (at least, it had never been spoken about in church). So basically, it&#8217;s an introduction to Mark 13, and therefore an introduction to preterism.

		<itunes:summary>Here&#8217;s part 2 on my series on hell. In this episode, I look at some key arguments against annihilationism and for the doctrine of eternal torment, and why those arguments fail.
As this episode ended up being longer than expected (there are plenty of bad arguments to cover!), I&#8217;ve decided to present a third episode in this series, where I will cover the remainder of the main arguments for the traditional view. But at least this time I managed to squeeze in my regular &#8220;This Week in History&#8221; segment.
The next episode will be a little shorter.

		<itunes:summary>We&#8217;ve made it to five episodes! This one is part one of a biblical and theological (mostly biblical) discussion  about hell, the doctrine of eternal punishment in Christian theology. It&#8217;s a two part presentation. In this part, I present my position on the subject, a view called annihilationism. In the next show I&#8217;ll be looking at argument against my view and in favour of a more traditional view of hell as a place of the eternal torment of the damned.
As I promised in the Episode, here&#8217;s a list of some prominent Christian thinkers who hold (or held &#8211; some of them are dead) to an annihilationist point of view:

John Stott
Michael Green
Clark Pinnock
Philip Edgecumbe Hughes
John Wenham
Dale Moody
Edward Fudge
Graham Scroggie
Edward White
Basil Atkinson
E. Earle Ellis
Homer Hailey

That&#8217;s what I came up with in 2 minutes. Now, come on in, the water&#8217;s lovely!
&#160;

		<itunes:summary>Episode 4 already. One more episode and I&#8217;m halfway to 10!
The main feature of this show is an audio dialogue, &#8220;A New Euthyphro.&#8221; This dialogue is a re-make of part of Plato&#8217;s Euthyphro dialogue, with a twist: This time Socrates&#8217; is armed with a little more philosophical acuity than the bumbling Euthyphro that Socrates gave us. This time, the so-called &#8220;Euthyphro Dilemma&#8221; fails abysmally as an attack on divine command ethics.
