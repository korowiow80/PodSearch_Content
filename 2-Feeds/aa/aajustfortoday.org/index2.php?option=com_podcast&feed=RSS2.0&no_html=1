still go wrong. Turbulence and trial will happen in life and in
sobriety. Just because we are working the 12 steps, the program, and

            <description> This show talks about where expectations, unreasonable or otherwise, can 
lead us. Don't set yourself up for disappointment. Sobriety isn't the 
solution in and of itself. The ups and downs in life still exist in 
Sobriety, they are just a lot less magnified.

            <description> Dan talks about how to tell people that you are close to about your decision 
to do something about your alcoholism, and how doing it for yourself is 
key in sobriety. They probably already know you have an alcohol problem, they have 
seen us in action. The best way to tell them you&amp;amp;#39;re a recovering alcoholic is to show them.

Dick aslo talks about how Christians mistakenly view AA as not being a God-centered program and might discourage or be discouraged from joiing the fellowship. DICK B.

            <description> In honor of Easter, Dan talks about letting the alcoholic die so that you may live. A raging alcholic is a lot like a zombie - dead to the ways of life and the ways of properly dealing with its ups and downs. When things are good, an alcoholic celebrates by getting drunk. When things are bad, and alcoholic hides from the emotions by getting drunk. They become a zombie. Let that zombie die so that the clean and sober human being which you were born can come back to life and live it to the fullest.

            <description> In the early stages of sobriety, and throughout life, there are bound to be challenges to your sobriety. As time goes on and you learn how to properly deal with the challenges that life throws at you, those temptations become weaker and have less and less power to threaten your mental health, happiness and sober living. Eventually you should be able to get to the point where no matter what life throws at you, you can say,  Is that all you&amp;amp;#39;ve got?

            <itunes:summary> In the early stages of sobriety, and throughout life, there are bound to be challenges to your sobriety. As time goes on and you learn how to properly deal with the challenges that life throws at you, those temptations become weaker and have less and less power to threaten your mental health, happiness and sober living. Eventually you should be able to get to the point where no matter what life throws at you, you can say,  Is that all you&amp;amp;#39;ve got?

            <description> This episode is about living Step 11
from the Alcoholics Anonymous Twelve Steps which is about about continuing to improve our conscious contact with a higher power. It&amp;amp;#39;s not about asking for what we want, but about being willing to want what&amp;amp;#39;s right for us. AA is a fellowship of people who
work together towards sobriety while accepting that our lives is better off in God&amp;amp;#39;s control than our own.

            <description> Bob and Dan continue to discuss a wide range of topics. They talk about
helping other alcoholics who have recently reached their rock bottom
and how the first few AA meetings tend to be uncomfortable to people
and are met with some denial. Also, they discuss how the fellowship of
AA works to get people sober and help them stay that way. The movie
 Groundhog Day  comes up as fable of which the moral is each day is a
chance to change.

talks to Bob J., a Southerner who has been transplanted to Boston. In
his upbringing Bob was exposed to a drinking, pot smoking culture which
enticed him to join in the fun. Into adulthood Bob realized alcoholism
was not fun at all. Bob has been sober for seven years and began his recovery
midlife. Bob and Dan discuss a wide range of topics such as pride and
asking for help, getting to meetings, losing and keeping jobs,
gratitude, bouncing back, and enjoying life again.

once again from his own life experiences, Dan shows how being in a
state of denial about some problem in your life will slowly lead to
nothing but trouble and take away your sobriety.

This is the last in series of interviews with AA historian Dick B.
Having suffered from depression well into the fifties, Dick says that
Bill Wilson began to venture into the worlds of spiritualism and
psychedelic drug use including LSD. As Dick&amp;amp;#39;s story winds up, Doctor
Bob agrees to the incorporation of the 12 Traditions into the fabric of
Alcoholics Anonymous for among other reasons to assure the ongoing work
of AA after Bill and Bob were gone. Dick talks more about the original
tenets of the Oxford Group and the Akron group and how they have
evolved though various revisions to become what AA is today and he
talks about his feeling that the Biblical roots of AA have been watered
down to appeal to a larger audience. DICK B. BOOKS. (index.php?option=com_content task=view id=49 Itemid=)

Anita S. is interviewed in this segment of AA Just For Today. She
discusses with Dan her drinking problems as a young adult in college,
suicide attempts, and a marriage, and then her sixteen years of
sobriety. She and Dan talk at length about how surrender to a higher
power is necessary not only at the beginning of the road to sobriety,
but along the way as well. Anita also talks about how when you are
ready for a teacher, the teacher appears, meaning that until you are
ready to surrender to solutions outside of yourself, you cannot see
those solutions even though they may be right in front of your face.

A disappointing first release of the Big Book and religious differences
are shaping the future of AA and other programs at the turn of the
decade in 1939. At that time a man named Clarence Snyder comes into the
picture, solidifies the various camps somewhat and achieves a period of
strong growth for Alcoholics Anonymous. Even still, Dick says, Bill W.
spends the next decade in depression. Dick also mentions  The Four

            <itunes:summary> 
A disappointing first release of the Big Book and religious differences
are shaping the future of AA and other programs at the turn of the
decade in 1939. At that time a man named Clarence Snyder comes into the
picture, solidifies the various camps somewhat and achieves a period of
strong growth for Alcoholics Anonymous. Even still, Dick says, Bill W.
spends the next decade in depression. Dick also mentions  The Four
Absolutes,  early developed principles of AA. (Please note that Dick

Dick B. gets into the turbulent times that surrounded the formation of
AA in the late thirties with tales of Nazis, communism, the Bible, the
draft, Rockefeller, and the Salvation Army. He also lays out a
fascinating seven point synopsis of the principles of Alcoholics
Anonymous penned at that time by Dr. Bob and Bill Wilson, et al. Dick
also draws connections between Bill&amp;amp;#39;s incorporation of AA, the
evolution of the Big Book, and the omitting of the religious rituals
used by other groups. (Please note that Dick has broken his lecture

Dan gets personal today and shares some of his own challenges. Having
gone through a a period of being in a sub-standard mood, he can share
first hand how things can build up and send you down the wrong path a
little at a time until you suddenly realize you&amp;amp;#39;ve lost your way and
you sobriety - that is if you don&amp;amp;#39;t realize what&amp;amp;#39;s happening before
it&amp;amp;#39;s too late like Dan did. The message is this: When life seems to be
giving you grief that&amp;amp;#39;s the time to take a hard look at yourself and
see that you are probably not accepting and trying to change things you
cannot change. The resistance life gives you should tell you something.
You&amp;amp;#39;re swimming against the tide. Turn around.

fathers, and its connections to their religious experiences and

how Alcoholics Anonymous got started and how it grew into the
organization that it is today. Dick starts by talking about how he came
to take on researching the history of AA and his feeling that no one

account starts with Dr. Bob and Bill W. and the writing of the Big Book
and the Twelve Steps and points out the connections between the bible
and the basic tenets of Alcoholics Anonymous. DICK B. BOOKS. (index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=49&amp;amp;Itemid=)

Dan talks to Sandy B., a woman who didn&amp;amp;#39;t begin drinking until she was
30 years old after a drama-filled breakup with an adulterous husband.
Along the way she has lost much including a job and a lover. After
hitting bottom and feeling as if her spirit had died, she put her faith
in her higher power and began attending local AA meetings. She has been
sober for 19 months as of this interview. Do you have a sobriety
milestone coming up? We would like to mention it on the air as
congratulations and encouragement for those just starting out in AA.

sobriety with Cindy G., a wife and mother of two teenage children. A
self-proclaimed party girl in her younger years, Cindy didn&amp;amp;#39;t begin
drinking regularly until her middle years. She&amp;amp;#39;s had suspected she
might have a problem a couple years ago. It wasn&amp;amp;#39;t until a recent
blackout which her son had to point out, Cindy realized she had too
much to lose to continue to let alcoholism endanger her health and her
home life.

In the earliest stages of recovery, many alcoholics require medical

change their minds. Early treatment options include rehabilitation
centers, hospitalization, medication, counseling, and of course,
Alcoholics Anonymous. Dan also talks about how the support of your
friends and family can be crucial if you do not enter a detox/rehab
