&lt;br /&gt;
On this episode, I sit down with an old friend from college, playwright and actress Suehyla El Attar. She will be leading two workshops at the 2012 WV Writers Summer Conference which are not only helpful for playwrights, but storytellers, poets, writers and any form of creative endeavor. Suehyla bases her workshops on work she did with movement storyteller Celeste Miller. She explains Celeste&apos;s approach. &lt;br /&gt;

In honor of April being National Poetry Month, the WV Writers Podcast returns from a long hiatus (explained within) with a recorded live reading captured at the 2011 Literary Tea Poetry Edition at the Greenbrier Valley Theatre in Lewisburg, WV.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
(In case you&apos;d like a hint as to why the podcast has been gone so long, this episode was recorded atop a hill in a county other than Mercer County.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&apos;s a good thing.)</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
One of the guest presenters at this year&apos;s West Virginia Book Festival was author Jaimy Gordon.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Her books include &quot;Bogeywoman,&quot; &quot;She Drove Without Stopping&quot; and &quot;Shamp of the City-Solo.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But it is her most recent novel, Lord of Misrule, that has gained the most acclaim, being the winner of the National Book Award for Fiction in 2010.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It’s a novel set in West Virginia, amidst the world of horse-racing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 Jaimy was gracious enough to sit down with us for a conversation with fellow WV Writers member Dr. Edwina Pendarvis. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks go out to Phyllis Wilson Moore for arranging this interview.</description>

This week we present a recorded live reading from the 2011 WVW Summer Conference featuring Susanna &quot;Granny Sue&quot; Holstein. She’s been a featured storytelling performer at events from Bellingham, Washington to Boston, Massachusetts and points in between. She&apos;s especially well known, however, for being a West Virginia storyteller, focusing much of her repertoire on WV history, ghost stories, Appalachian tales and ballads.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Way back in June, we put out a call for our listeners to submit Dear City Letters to help drum up some publicity for National Public Radio&apos;s State of the Re:Union paying a visit to our state. With the Dear City letters, people were invited to write a letter to their city, expressing love, anger, frustration, humor and beyond, addressing the likes and dislikes or breaking misconceptions. We passed the letters we received on to NPR. This podcast is our chance to finally play them.</description>

&lt;br /&gt;
Podcast Episode 45 is a landmark recorded live reading of the Woodland Press Writing and Publishing Panel from October 23 at Taylor Books on Capitol Street in downtown Charleston.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is a panel designed to be a brief overview on publishing using a variety of methods from traditional to self-publishing as well as some of the ins and outs of the publishing business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Featured in the panel are Woodland Press authors Karin Fuller, Geoff Fuller, Eric Fritzius, Michael Knost, Jason L. Keene, Frank Lanerd and Brian J. Hatcher.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The panel is led by 2010 Bram Stoker Award winner Michael Knost, co-founder of Woodland Press.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taylor Books, by the way, is a fantastic bookstore and they stock not only titles by Woodland Press but also WV Writers own anthology Seeking the Swan.</description>

            <title>Dear City Letters Still Wanted for Upcoming Podcast</title>
            <description>Back in July, we worked with a producer of National Public Radio&apos;s show State of the Re:Union to drum up support for their &quot;Dear City&quot; letters segment to help them find material for their upcoming show based in West Virginia. We thought it would be fun to do something similar for our podcast and, with their consent, are going to do so.

The Dear City Letters are basically what they sound like: people writing a letter TO their city. These can be written from a place of love, anger, humor and beyond, addressing the likes and dislikes or breaking misconceptions. As part of our collaboration, the WV Writers Podcast opened its voicemail hotline to listeners to phone in such letters. We forwarded those we received to State of the Re:Union and are planning to also use them for an upcoming podcast.

If you would like to participate with your own Dear City letter, please do so, for there is still time.

Here are your instructions:

    * People can feel free to be as creative as they&apos;d like... the only constraint is to keep it under 400 words.
    * All the letters should start the same way with &quot;Dear _____ [your town name here],” i.e. if you live in Parkersburg, you should start “Dear Parkersburg.”
    * Also, remember to refer to your home in the second person (You). We want these to sound like you&apos;re speaking directly to your home.
    * Once your letter is written, phone up the WV Writers Podcast voicemail hotline so we can record it. The number is 304-661-9745.
    * When you call, you will have 2:45 sec to record your dear city letter. If your letter runs longer, feel free to call back and record the rest.
    * If you mess up, just say 3…2… 1 and start where you left off; we can edit out the errors.</description>

            <title>Episode 34 - Pitching to Agents 101 with Christine Witthohn</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_MSxF8lkMamk/TA5dIktGH9I/AAAAAAAAAGU/h9CjViOU3aw/s1600/wvwp-episode34.jpg"><img width="200" height="200" alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_MSxF8lkMamk/TA5dIktGH9I/AAAAAAAAAGU/h9CjViOU3aw/s1600/wvwp-episode34.jpg"></a><br />
<br />
This week we present our much heralded interview with Christine Witthohn from Bookcents Literary Agency in Charleston. Christine is a guest at this coming weekend’s 2010 WV Writers Summer Conference. There, she'll be joining fellow agent Kelly Mortimer and Sourcebooks, Inc, editorial manager Peter Lynch to take pitches from conference attendees for potential representation or publication.<br />
<br />
To prep our attendees for the sessions, Christine and one of her clients, writer S.G. Redling, will be leading a workshop on Saturday morning on how to pitch to agents and editors. However, I thought it would be good to get a podcast preview of that information here so that our listeners who want to pitch can go into the conference with a heads up on the process. Christine also explains what kind of material she is looking for at Book Cents.<br />

To prep our attendees for the sessions, Christine and one of her clients, writer S.G. Redling, will be leading a workshop on Saturday morning on how to pitch to agents and editors. However, I thought it would be good to get a podcast preview of that information here so that our listeners who want to pitch can go into the conference with a heads up on the process. Christine also explains what kind of material she is looking for at Book Cents.</itunes:summary>

            <title>New Blog Address</title>
            <description>Since the beginning of this podcast, nigh on a year back, we’ve repeatedly given out our web address so that you can find us online. Thanks to some technobabble-worthy issues behind the scenes, though, our address has had to change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the old address will still get you here (at least after 30 seconds, when it forcibly bounces you), the new address for the show is now and will hopefully forever more be Podcast.WVWriters.org. Similarly, address for the West Virginia Writers blog has also changed and is now Blog.WVWriters.org.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&apos;re not complaining, as this is a simpler address to remember than our old one and the move has allowed us to do lots of modification on the site that would otherwise have been more difficult to do. Expect some visual changes and new features (not to mention a sidebar that gets updated more often) on both the podcast page and the blog.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of the old posts of both the blog and the podcast are now in place at the new addresses and feed service will soon resume. So if you have us bookmarked anywhere, please change to the new addresses.</description>

Our 8th bonus show is extry short, but is important if you're going to be in the Charleston area on February 13 and if you're interested in improving your writing.<br />
<br />
The Writer's Toolkit event will be taking place at the cultural center, featuring free writing workshops for fiction, nonfiction, poetry and nonfiction research. The event is brought to you by the WV Division of Culture and History in collaboration with the WV Library Commission. You can find specific details about it at our <a href="http://www.wvwriters.org/2010/02/reminder-about-this-weekends-writers.html">BLOG</a>, but get an overview by listening to the bonus show. <br />
<br />
PLEASE NOTE: According to the Charleston Gazette, State Poet Laureate Irene McKinney will not be able to attend the annual Writers' Toolkit as originally scheduled due to weather concerns, but the program will still continue with the authors below and poet and essayist Doug Van Gundy will step in to take the workshop spaces left by McKinney.<br />
<br />
As an added bonus to the bonus, you also get to hear the host of the show play his brand new cigar box guitar and the cohosts of the show supply their critique.<br />

            <title>WV Writers Podcast: Ep 24 - Keith Pitzer Tribute with Pops Walker</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<i>"It’s with a heavy heart that I write to you today, for we have lost a great friend and performer, Keith Pitzer. Keith passed on this morning after a courageous fight with cancer. His wife Joan, and his four grown sons mourn the loss of their loved one, as do I, Bobbi, and anyone who knew Keith."</i> -- Pops Walker<br />
<br />
This is the opening paragraph from a letter written by Keith's friend and our podcast composer, Pops Walker. Written on December 22, the day Keith passed, it is how many of us first learned the news. Keith was not only a friend of this podcast, but he was a friend of our organization as well.<br />
<br />
I thought for today’s special double-sized podcast it would be nice to speak with Pops in tribute to Keith. I wanted to get Pops' perspective on Keith the man and hear about his tireless work with Friends of the Cheat, and also hear of his skill as a musician. We'll also hear some of the outtakes from my interview with him last June, including some of the amazing music he made alongside his wife Joan.<br />

                <![CDATA[<img alt="" border="0" src="http://www.wvwriters.org/uploaded_images/syc-791775.jpg"><br />
This week we present a special double-sized podcast episode in tribute to WV Writers founder Shirley Young Campbell, who passed away August 17, 2009. For this special episode, we interview Kirk Judd, Dr. Barbara Smith and Dolly Withrow, each counted among the charter members of WV Writers and longtime friends of Mrs. Campbell.<br />

We speak to them about Mrs. Campbell's many accomplishments in promoting the writing and writers of WV, her role as the driving force in the creation of West Virginia Writers, Inc., her co-founding of Mountain State Press, her own writing career and many publications, what she was like as a person, and her role in mentoring many of the finest writers of our state and beyond. <br />

A POEM FOR SHIRLEY YOUNG CAMPBELL<br />
BY BOYD CARR<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shirley Young Campbell ~ 8-19-09<br />
<br />
i was a budding writer in her fold ~<br />
when i got into My.th day/nights<br />
i would send her my papers ~<br />
<br />
at the wvw ink i would sit with her<br />
& go over them ~ she said two things ~<br />
a thousand years is not a very long time &<br />
<br />
do you think if i had gone to the<br />
university of virginia i could understand<br />
your My.th ?<br />
<br />
when i had my hernia Repaired she held<br />
her second Hill & Valley party ~ i phoned<br />
her & declined ~ she said that in her business<br />
<br />
a hernia was not even considered a disability ~<br />
i stayed home & sulked ~<br />
she said she used to have a public speaking<br />
<br />
voice but when i knew her it had cracked ~<br />
Ed ~ her husband ~ gave me a walking stick<br />
with a head carved on one end ~ i can see it<br />
<br />
now in the cane &umbrella stand ~one day<br />
i said to Shirley ~ i am being discovered ~<br />
she Replied ~ you have already been discovered<br />

            <description>Welcome to Episode 15, in which we talk to storyteller Susanna &quot;Granny Sue&quot; Holstein. She’s been a featured storytelling performer at events from Bellingham, Washington to Boston, Massachusetts and points in between. She&apos;s especially well known, however, for being a West Virginia storyteller, focusing much of her repertoire on WV history, ghost stories, Appalachian tales and ballads.

We speak to her about her origins in the art of storytelling, the fluidity of the artform, the skills required to do it correctly and, of course, we&apos;ll hear one of her more famous stories.

You can see Granny Sue for yourself at: the WV Book Festival (October 10-11); at the Patchwork Storytelling Festival in Beckley (October 23-24); at Tygart Lake State Park in Grafton for a program called Scary Stories after Dark (October 24); in Athens, Alabama, at the Storytelling Festival Ghost Stories Concert as a featured teller (October 30); and at Tellabration! WVU Mountaineer Week, Morgantown, WV, (November 14).

And be sure to stick around for the end credits for a special announcement concerning bonus features of this podcast that are in the works and which will debut as soon as next Friday. Plus we&apos;ll offer a preview of the next two weeks of podcasts.</description>
