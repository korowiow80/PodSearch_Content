ORIGINALLY RECORDED ON 15-NOVEMBER-2011

This week, Sam Toles and Greg Maratea discuss the meaning of the results of the Off Off Year election, the Republican 2012 Nominating Contest, Bill Clinton, Obama 2012, and the clearing out of the Occupy movement.

Will Newt Gingrich take the nomination?  Will Obama run a Rove-like re-election campaign?  Why is Bill Clinton just so darned good at politics?  And... What happened to the right to free speech for the Occupy movement?

Greg and this week's co-host, Sam, break it down for you.

      <title>Episode 29 - Huntsman, Romney, Hilary, Weiner, Debt Ceiling, Rinse, Repeat</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1188570/600x600_4623692.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Episode 29 of &quot;What's Left&quot;

ORIGINALLY RECORDED 12-JUNE-2011

This week, Sam Toles and Greg chat about the prospects of John Huntsman or Mitt Romney or Michele Bachmann taking the Republican Presidential Nomination and/or prevailing over 44 - Barry Obama in 2012.  It doesn't seem probable with the current crop of Republican candidates, until you read Obama's numbers in the battleground polls.

Also covered are the hot topics of the week - the United States' Economy v.  Republican Austerity Measures, the game of chicken being played with the Debt Ceiling,  the trial balloon of Hilary Rodham Clinton as the head of the World Bank, (thankfully briefly) Representative Anthony Weiner (D, NY-9), and the latest in Cathedral City CA self governance.

Folks, it is time to turn left, What's Left.</description>

      <title>Episode 28  - The Other Side of Fair and Balanced - 2011</title>

ORIGINALLY RECORDED 14-APRIL-2011

Sam Toles returns to discuss the week in politics &quot;Other Side of Fair and Balanced&quot;-style, including, the Paul Ryan/GOP proposal to balance the budget, the Obama response, and the 2012 Republican Presidential field.

Donald Trump, Michele Bachmann, Mitt Romney, Iowa, Ohio, Taxes, The Bond Market, Glenn Beck, and Election Year 2012 - - how will it all fit together?


Also, especially insightful is Sam's take on California Governor Jerry Brown's proposal to balance the CA State budget, in-part, by cutting redevelopment funds to local government.  Being a member of the City Council of Cathedral City, Sam's view is informative and instructive.

      <title>Episode 27 - 2010 Year In Review</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1188570/600x600_3807191.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to Episode 27 of &quot;What's Left&quot;.

ORIGINALLY RECORDED 12-31-2010

This week Ryan and Greg review the year in politics for 2010 and the shadow the Mid-Term Elections and the Lame Duck Session will cast over 2011.

Obama got Gays in the Military, a Nuclear Arms Reduction Treaty, and a second (larger) stimulus bill through Congress.  All victories that make 44 look Presidential.  Republicans got the House and the fire from the Tea Party. Senate Democrats running for re-election in 2012 are scared of the GOP momentum.

Which will influence the coming year(s) more?

Thank You for listening.  Happy 2011 to you all.

This week, among all of the stories to cover, one stands above the rest, Sarah Palin is running for President.   Admittedly, Sarah has not declared officially, but she is thinking about it, and she believes she can beat Barry.

Hate it or love it the under dog's on top.

Of course, also discussed are Barack Obama, the Lame Duck Session, handicapping the new political reality, the countdown to 2012, and the weekly features &quot;Reagan or Carter&quot; &amp; &quot;Richter Scale&quot; predictions.

Am I falling back in like with George Walker Bush?  Can Barry Obama pivot and survive?  Is Sarah Palin going to be the next President of the United States of America?

Not since election year 2008 could you, would you - possibly - hear a discussion of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Sarah Palin all making news in the same political week.  Of course, there is the Debt Commission preliminary recommendations, the Obama trip to India, G20, and Asia, and Much Much More.

This week, it's all about the November 2, 2010, California Ballot Initiatives.

Ryan and Greg discuss Sexy and timely issues such as, California Redistricting, Legalizing Marijuana, paying $18 for parks, and much, much, more.

One of the rare episodes with less conjecture and actual information.  The boys actually have researched the initiatives, explain them in relatively open minded fashion, and opine from a relatively factual point of view.

Even if you 180 degree disagree, you will walk away with a better understanding of the issues before you, the likely California Voter.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Welcome to Episode 22 of What's Left

This week, it's all about the November 2, 2010, California Ballot Initiatives.

Ryan and Greg discuss Sexy and timely issues such as, California Redistricting, Legalizing Marijuana, paying $18 for parks, and much, much, more.

One of the rare episodes with less conjecture and actual information.  The boys actually have researched the initiatives, explain them in relatively open minded fashion, and opine from a relatively factual point of view.

Even if you 180 degree disagree, you will walk away with a better understanding of the issues before you, the likely California Voter.</itunes:summary>

Realizing that we are way past the tipping point, with Republican momentum still yet to peak, the discussion revolves around the following:

Wake Up Democrats, V O T E !

How can there be an enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans?  If you are a Democrat, and if you are disenchanted with Barry, wait until Speaker Boehner arrives on the scene.

If you are a Democrat and disappointed in the 44th President of the United States, wait until there are Tea Partiers not only in the house, but in the Senate...  Six years of at least two, possibly three Senators Tea Party...


Some of the side show events that pass for candidates and/or political news are also discussed.

Yes indeed, Greg fell for Obama's rallying cry, and wonders aloud if the Democrats are as bad off as they obviously are.  Are you ready to walk down &quot;suspension of disbelief lane&quot; with Greg, or are you sure there will be Speaker Boehner?

Of course, there is a bit of Christine O'Donnell,and Krystal Ball (and the Phallic Holiday Costume).

Spend some of the last minutes of the Democratic Party's, and possibly Barry Obama's, Glory Days with Ryan and Greg.

Sorry folks, but this week is dominated by the resignation and emancipation and media fascination with... Sarah Palin.

Steve and Greg debate the possibilities for (soon to be former) Governor of Alaska. 

Also discussed are California and Prop 13 - the race to the bottom, Obama's summit with Russia, Robert McNamara, Iran, Al Franken and the myth of the Democratic Super Majority.

BONUS MATERIAL: Hear the entire Palin resignation announcement and Rush Limbaugh's reaction, in total, at the end of the podcast.

 It's a lively inter-weaved discussion of the week's political events.

This week, Steve and Greg dissect Gallows Politics.  It is not &quot;it's almost as if&quot;, it's Cheney IS wishing that the U.S. will be attacked again in order to make his point.

Along with Bush 43 admin v. Obama, the boys discuss presidential approval poll numbers and whether or not the Obama honeymoon is over, Left and LGBT dissatisfaction with Obama, Obama Doing Too Much Vs. Obama not Doing Enough, the Iran Election, North Korea, and our weekly favorites - Sarah Palin and the Grand Old Party of No.

      <title>Episode 10 - Chris Burnet Sets The Boys Straight</title>

The discussion is wide-ranging, touching upon U.S. Empire, climate change, the environment, the power structure inherent, capitalism, and whether or not Obama will actually change anything that matters.  

Chris is a pioneer in the independent media movement, one of the founding members and catalysts in the creation of killradio.org, and the host of &quot;Indymedia On Air&quot; on KPFK 90.7 in Los Angeles.  Extraordinarily well read, well thought out, Chris brings a perspective that penetrates deeper than the first dog, pirates, or Navy Seal snipers.
