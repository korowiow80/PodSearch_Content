  <title>Moonlight Sonata - 4m37s</title>
  <category>Classical</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-moonlight-sonata-4m37s-p-1784.html</link>
  <description>White Beetle proudly presents its very own recording of Beethoven's first movement of the &lt;i&gt;Moonlight Sonata&lt;/i&gt;. It is hard to believe this timeless classic is now over two hundred and ten years old. The piece is actually called &lt;i&gt;Piano Sonata No. 14 in C-sharp minor "Quasi una fantasia", Op. 27, No. 2&lt;/i&gt;. So it is a sonata in the manner of a fantasy but the popular title &lt;i&gt;Moonlight Sonata&lt;/i&gt; was actually penned after Beethoven's death by a German poet who compared the first movement to moonlight hitting and reflecting off water, not everyone agrees and some find the title over romantic for a piece that is more of a funeral march than a sonata for ships that pass in the night. The name, however, did stick as the public seemed to warm to moody nocturnal imagery coupled with the melancholic air of this classic piece of music.
&lt;p&gt;
The Moonlight Sonata is made up of three movements, Adagio sostenuto, Allegreto and Presto agitato. This royalty free music version is taken from the first movement &lt;i&gt;Adagio sostenuto&lt;/i&gt; and has a running time of four minutes and thirty seven seconds. This music is suitable for all types of media productons.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Composed by Ludwig van Beethoven.

  <title>Time Machine - 3m33s</title>
  <category>Electronic</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-time-machine-3m33s-p-1782.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Time Machine&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary electronic track with great developing momentum and use of sounds.  Built around repetitive synthesizer sequences and ethereal chord movements there is a very moreish and trance like quality to this track as the composer opens up the rhythm with heavier power beats and then skilfully stripping the piece bare again.
&lt;p&gt;
Futuristic, slick and dark, this track oozes a nervous energy as if depicting the debut of a new dangerous journey that is both full of trepidation and excitement. Elements of the early &lt;i&gt;Nine Inch Nails&lt;/i&gt; or perhaps &lt;i&gt;Massive Attack&lt;/i&gt; as the synth bass and well written sequences show of the drum machines and dirty synth lines.
The running time is three minutes and thirty three seconds and the tempo is medium.
&lt;P&gt;
This is a dark and evocative music underscore that media producers will find useful in modern/sci fi film/television and video game productions

  <title>The Ruthless Guitar - 2m14s</title>
  <category>Rock Instrumentals</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-the-ruthless-guitar-2m14s-p-1781.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Ruthless Guitar&lt;/i&gt; is a very cool laid back instrumental Rock music underscore that is centered around a taut tremolo-ed guitar chord. The track does not wander up or down and instead keeps a level of tension constant through out. Picture the opening scene in a &lt;i&gt;Tarantino&lt;/i&gt; flick with unsavory characters milling about or even a modern day Cowboy film, you cannot escape the the unruly, ruthless and menacing edge to this piece of royalty free music. 
&lt;P&gt;
This is a spooky track with menace creeping around under the surface, hip break beat drums and and a second haunting electric guitar melody help to develop this tense track. The running time is two minutes and fourteen seconds and the tempo is medium.
&lt;P&gt;
This is a dark and evocative music underscore that media producers will find useful in modern day film/television and video game productions

  <category>Electronic</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-the-girl-is-crazy-2m20s-p-1780.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Girl Is Crazy&lt;/i&gt; is a hybrid electronic track that incorporates analog synthesizer sounds with octave bass, moody guitars and sparse melodic piano parts. The running time for this modern slick sounding piece of royalty free music is two minutes and twenty seconds and the tempo is medium. At times there is an eighties/nineties &lt;i&gt;Depeche Mode&lt;/i&gt; feel to this track, obviously the synths help but the awkward and surreal feel of the track also contribute here. It has that weird, strange and slightly twisted sadness about it so an ideal music bed for depicting scenes in social dramas and documentaries.
&lt;p&gt;
The combination of the electronic break beat and swirling pads create an uneasy calm while the guitar and piano add a human and emotional element. This is a dark and haunting piece that media producers will find useful in modern day film/television and video game productions

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Take My Heart&lt;/i&gt; is a mellow Latin/bossa nova styled instrumental piece of royalty free music that displays a soft romantic feel. The running time is just under two minutes and the tempo is moderate.
&lt;p&gt;
Acoustic piano leads this pleasant track with elegant melodies and the electric guitar occasionally adds jazzy melodic flurries. The soft feel of the jazz brushes on the drums and the gentle upright bass help this smoochy track amble along on its smooth jazz, easy listing bossa nova way.

A sensitive royalty Free music bed for depicting sunny holiday scenes, beach scenes, night time  bar scenes and more.

&lt;p&gt;
Underpinned by cool percussion track, &lt;i&gt;Strange Events&lt;/i&gt; features an off chord slightly spooky electric piano part, with a funky electric bass guitar holding down the unresolved feel.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Mad Technology&lt;/i&gt; is an agressive industrial sound music score full of suspense, strangely dark and tense. With a running time of two minutes and fifty seven seconds, this  mechanical and metallic sounding track has quickish tempo with a hard hitting percussion track. Ominous and scary, the music builds in a repetive and monotonous manner remaining firmly in one key at the root.
&lt;p&gt;
Echo on the bass and a massive kick give this piece a sci fi or horror feel, as if something is out there looking for you and leaving nothing it its wake. Primitive and tribal this piece of royalty free music is suitable for technology shows, futurisitic/Sci Fi productions,  fast moving action films scenes, and video games.

Melodic but not demanding, this track is the perfect underscore for many applications, documentary and voice overs easily spring to mind as well as films scenes and advertising.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Dangerous Chemistry&lt;/i&gt; is an ambient, unsettling and nervous piece of royalty free music for use in film or television. Contemporary in style it layers a repetitive electronic rhythm with what sounds like plucked guitar harmonics to create an uneasy and disjointed feel. Eerie high pitched synthesizer pads, occasional metallic percussion hits and a hypnotic swinging sound help fortify this weird and cold sound track. Thoroughly uneasy and pensive &lt;i&gt;Dangerous Chemistry&lt;/i&gt; has a running time of two minutes and thirty one seconds.
&lt;p&gt;
Useful for for crime investigation/ thrillers, horror films, dark drama and documentary, this underscore cue is an excellent scary piece and shows good production skills from the composer.

  <title>Bolivian Carousel - 1m50s</title>
  <category>Children &amp; Comedy</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-bolivian-carousel-1m50s-p-1749.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Bolivian Carousel&lt;/i&gt; is an old fashioned and childish piece of music played with Bolivian pipes and has a sound very reminiscent of the &lt;i&gt;Calliope&lt;/i&gt; which you still see at amusements fairs. The Calliope is a musical instrument that sends steam or gas through a series of whistles in an automated way to create music. Often the Calliope had a little steam engine for producing the steam and would be mounted on a decorated horse drawn cart or carriage. This piece of music is playful, cheerful and has a nineteenth century sound to it.
&lt;p&gt;
Useful for animation, comedy and any kind of children media this nostalgic and bright piece of music has a running time of one minute and fifty seconds and could also be useful for the background music of a fair etc.

  <title>Below Expectations - 5m48s</title>
  <category>Piano</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-below-expectations-5m48s-p-1748.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Below Expectations&lt;/i&gt; is a piano led film underscore that is five minutes and forty nine seconds long. This is a high quality composition and presents itself as a comtemporary and melancholic piece of music that is aimed at video and film producers. The piece alternates between a sparse, melodic and slightly bitter piano arrangement which has some acoustic guitar harmonics added for ambience, and a more robust and modern arrangement with electronic filtered drums and a low rumbling bass. The result is serious and cinematic, sparse throughout with understated emotions lurking under a rather hypnotic piano line which incoporates slightly discordant moments into what is quite a melodic if not sad piece of music.
&lt;p&gt;
The theme is serious, sad, reflective, emotional and bittersweet and the cinematic edge to this piece of royalty free music is stunning and this is mainly due to the excellent production skills employed by a very talented composer. Serious and cinematic throughout. &lt;i&gt;Below Expectations&lt;/i&gt; will work very well as a music bed for a number of media applications particularly in film and video games. The quiet suspense enhances the feeling of emotional sadness while all the while there is an ominous undercurrent making it perfect for war and fantasy video games, action adventure, fighting/combat programs and video games.

  <title>Vivaldi in 21st Century - 2m04s</title>
  <category>Baroque</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-vivaldi-in-21st-century-2m04s-p-1746.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Vivaldi in 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a modern interpretation of &lt;i&gt;Antonio Vivaldi's&lt;/i&gt; "Le quattro stagioni" otherwise known as "The Four Seasons" which was composed in 1723. Possibly the most famous passage of Baroque music in the world, "The Four Seasons" consists of four concerto's all relating to one of the seasons. This adaptation from Alex Khaskin, which has a running time of two minutes and four seconds and a moderate tempo, draws from the "Spring" concerto, with a gentle string and harpsichord arrangement blended with a modern pop backing track including modern pop instruments such as electronic drum samples and synthesizer.  The result is very pleasant indeed.
&lt;p&gt;
Venetian born Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (1678 - 1741) is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the Baroque period. Though he scored over 40 operas, he is best known for his violin concertos and it may come as no surprise that he was also a virtuoso violinist. As we all know "The Four Seasons" is his most famous series of violin concertos.
&lt;p&gt;
This piece of royalty free music features quality arrangement skills and a contemporary sound and feel that make this music an excellent opportunity for the media producer to bring out the best in his or her production. Suitable for all kinds of media productions, especially Film production, comedy dramas, animations, video games, documentaries, radio shows and radio jingles.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Verdi in 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a modern interpretation of one &lt;i&gt;Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi's&lt;/i&gt; "Triumphant March ". With a running time of two minutes and four seconds and a medium tempo this grand and proud piece of royalty free music has a bold modern feel and arrangement. Blending orchestral instruments with modern pop instruments such as electronic drum samples and synthesizer sounds proves to be a successful collaboration here in this rousing theme.
&lt;p&gt;
Composing mainly operas, Giuseppe Fortunino Francesco Verdi (1813 - 1901) was an Italian composer of the Romantic period and is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the nineteenth century.

  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-tchaikovsky-in-21st-century-2m04s-p-1744.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Tchaikovsky in 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a modern interpretation of one of &lt;i&gt;Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky&lt;/i&gt; music themes. With a running time of two minutes and four seconds and a moderate tempo this glistening and enchanting piece of royalty free music has a gentle but very accomplised modern feel and arrangement. Blending orchestral instruments with modern pop instruments such as hip hop drum samples and synthesizer bass sounds proves to be a stylish hit here in this very slick production.
&lt;p&gt;
Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840 - 1893), the famous Russian composer wrote during the Romantic Era and although he knew the rather nationalistic group of composers known as "The Five" he was not one of them, he was however a very "Russian" composer and is considered to be the greatest Russian composer of the nineteenth century. His training was very formal, Western-orientated, but he remained well connected to Russian folk and song and was the most successful in bridging his formal training and techniques with the expression and experiences he drew from his much loved culture and country.

With a very Spanish flavour and led by Flamenco styled nylon strung guitar parts this piece of music is an eclectic mix of Iberian flavoured classical music cliches and the more folk like influences from the flamenco guitar. With a strong break beat drum beat, orchestral effects, obligatory trumpet and added street voices, &lt;i&gt;Spanish Matador of 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; presents itself nicely as a contemporary sound track with Classical and Spanish themes.

  <title>Chopin in 21st Century 1 - 2m04s</title>

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Chopin in 21st Century 1&lt;/i&gt; is a modern interpretation of &lt;i&gt;Frédéric François Chopin's&lt;/i&gt; "Prelude in C minor, op. 28 no. 20". With a running time of two minutes and four seconds and a medium tempo this adaptation has a dreamy ambient style with choral sound effects and delicate piano treatment. Nicely sequenced, the arrangement includes an array of modern sythesizer sounds and sampled instruments as well as a grand piano. This piece slowly builds with subtle yet complex counter melodies fortifying the piece as it progresses.
&lt;P&gt;
A little about the composer, Frédéric Chopin is the most famous virtuoso pianist/composer of the Romantic period. He is also regarded as the greatest Polish composer in history. He was born in 1810 in the Duchy of Warsaw to a French father and a Polish mother and began playing the piano at an early age and it soon became clear that he was a gifted pianist. At the age of twenty he moved to Paris where he made a good living teaching, composing and performing. Sadly he died of tuberculosis in Paris in 1849 at the young age of thirty nine.

  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-rossini-in-21st-century-2m05s-p-1741.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Rossini in 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a wonderful and moderd adaptation of musical themes from Gioachino Rossini. Gioachino Rossini (1792 - 1869) was a prolific Italian composer best known for writing operas, thirty nine in total.

  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-pachelbel-in-21st-century-2m03s-p-1740.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Pachelbel in 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary adaptation of Johann Pachelbel's beautiful &lt;i&gt;Canon In D major&lt;/i&gt;. Pachelbel was a German composer from the Baroque period. Sadly much of Pachelbel's work was lost and &lt;i&gt;Canon In D major&lt;/i&gt; was only rediscovered in the twentieth century and subsequently became a popular piece on Classical CD compilations as well as being played at weddings. Musically, this piece is interesting as it employs the "Canon" technique which is where several voices play the same music but in an ordered sequence.
&lt;p&gt;
With a running time of two minutes and three seconds a moderate tempo this gentle tune has been brought to life again with a ballad pop style backing track of piano, bass guitar, drums, percussion and Hammond organ.

Suitable for all kinds of media productions, especially Film production, comedy dramas, animations, video games, documentaries, radio shows and radio jingles.

&lt;p&gt;
Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714-1787) mainly composed operas in what is regarded as the early classical period as is acknowledged to as being highly influential in reforming and modernising opera so that is equally represented music and word and focussed on drama, love and passion.

  <title>Flight Of The Bumblebee - 1m13s</title>
  <category>Classical</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-flight-of-the-bumblebee-1m13s-p-1734.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Flight Of The Bumblebee&lt;/i&gt; composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, at the end of the nineteenth century, is an orchestral interlude for his opera "The Tale Of Tsar Sultan". This piece of music has a quick tempo and a running time of one minute and thirteen seconds. Legend has it that rock guitarist &lt;i&gt;Tiago Della Vega&lt;/i&gt; became the world's fastest guitarist playing &lt;i&gt;The Flight Of the Bumble Bee&lt;/i&gt; at a whopping three hundred and twenty beats per minute only to be outgunned by an American guitarist, John Taylor, who managed it at 
six hundred beats per minute: OMG!
&lt;p&gt;
Long has &lt;i&gt;The Flight OF The Bumblebee&lt;/i&gt; been a challenge to the ego of many a musician with its complex combination of sixteenths and chromatic runs set against a fast tempo. This version prepared by Alex Khaskin has very much the full orchesteral treatment and is wonderfully executed. This piece of royalty free music has a European Classical sound and feel and is a excellent opportunity for the media producer to bring out the best in his or her production. Suitable for all kinds of media productions, especially Film production, comedy dramas, animations, video games, documentaries, radio shows and radio jingles.

  <category>Classical Remakes</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-brahms-in-21st-century-p-1733.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Brahms in 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a modern interpretation of Johannes Brahms' &lt;i&gt;Hungarian Dance No.5 in G Minor&lt;/i&gt;. "Ungarische Tänze" or Hungarian Dances consists of twenty one mainly upbeat dance tunes based on Hungarian themes.  No.5 in G Minor is without doubt the most well known of Brahms' Hungarian Dances and is an energetic and romantic rollercoaster of a tune.
&lt;p&gt;
With a running time of two minutes and a fairly quick tempo this lively piece has been brought to life again with a rock baroque style. Based around electric violin and electric guitar, the backing from bass guitar and drums is very rock but the chorus sections have a more &lt;i&gt;Polka&lt;/i&gt; style feel with strings and Balalaika playing intricate harmonies over the rock guitar and drums.
&lt;p&gt;
Never too far from the fray is the orchestra waiting to pounce and the intro and ending provide magnificent contrast and colour to this lively piece. This piece of royalty free music has a contemporary European sound and feel and is a excellent opportunity for the media producer to bring out the best in his or her production. Suitable for all kinds of media productions, especially Film production, comedy dramas, animations, video games, documentaries, radio shows and radio jingles.

  <category>Classical Remakes</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-borodin-in-21st-century-2m05s-p-1732.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Borodin in 21st Century 1&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary interpretation of an extract from Alexander Porfiryevich Borodin's &lt;i&gt;Polovetsian Dances&lt;/i&gt;. The keen eared amongst will also recognise the piece of music to be the same as &lt;i&gt;Stranger In Paradise&lt;/i&gt; from the musical "Kismet" which Robert Wright and George Forrest adapated from Borodin's &lt;i&gt;Polovetsian Dances&lt;/i&gt;. 
&lt;p&gt;
Borodin, himself was a Russian composer and also an important chemist, of all things. He was well known for his symphonies, his opera &lt;i&gt;Prince Igor&lt;/i&gt;, and giving the musical inspiration, of course, for the musical Kismet. Debussy and Ravel were both highly influenced by his evocative and exotic music style.
&lt;p&gt;
With a running time of two minutes and five seconds and a medium tempo this easy going piece has been brought to life again with a modern jazz/bossa nova/classical style. Based around the pretty melody from the classical guitar and the typical bossa rhythm guitar, this instrumental feutures a very smooth arrangement with strings, harp and other orchestral instruments pitching in with delicate cameos. 
&lt;p&gt;
This piece of royalty free music has a cultured and contemporary sound and feel and is a excellent opportunity for the media producer to bring out the best in his or her production. Suitable for all kinds of media productions, especially Film production, comedy dramas, animations, video games, documentaries, radio shows and radio jingles.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Bizet in 21st Century 2&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary interpretation of an extract from the exotic and passionate sounding opera, "Carmen", composed by Georges Bizet. More precisely, this piece of royalty free music is adapted from the "entr' acte", literally the piece of music played between the acts in an opera, and is actually the &lt;i&gt;entr' acte&lt;/i&gt; between act three and act four of Carmen. This is a lively and inviting piece with the melody being led by violins and driven by a Latin feel.
&lt;p&gt;
With a running time of two minutes and two seconds and a medium tempo this lively piece has been brought to life again with an eclectic modern style incorporating rock, jazz and classical. Based around the slippery melody of violins the main instrumentation includes electric piano, drums and percussion, electric bass guitar, classical guitar and electric guitar.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Bizet in 21st Century 1&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary interpretation of the exotic and passionate sounding aria from Georges Bizet's famous opera, "Carmen", often known as &lt;i&gt;Habanera&lt;/i&gt;. A habenara is a type of Cuban dance music that was popular in the nineteenth century. To confue things a little more this aria is also referred to as &lt;i&gt;L'amour est un oiseau rebelle&lt;/i&gt;. The piece has very much an Iberian/Latin American feel and in fact Bizet adapted the habanera from a Spanish composer, Sebastián Yradier.
&lt;p&gt;
With a running time of two minutes and two seconds and a medium tempo this lively piece has been brought to life again with a jazz style arrangement based around piano, pizzicato strings, double bass, jazz drums, brass, accordion and glockenspiel.

  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-beethoven-in-21st-century-2m03s-p-1729.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Beethoven in 21st Century&lt;/i&gt; is a contemporary interpretation of the extremely famous piece "Beethoven Sonata no.8 Pathetique - 2nd Movement". Ludwig van Beethoven wrote Piano Sonata No.8 at the age of twenty seven in the year 1798 and dedicated it to a Austrian royal, Prince Lichnowsky, who was a friend and supporter of Beethoven, until they fell out around the year of 1806. It is thought the movement was perhaps inspired by Mozart's "Piano Sonata K. 457". Interestingly, Lichnowsky also knew Mozart whom he had loaned a substantial amount of money that was never paid back. Some of you may recognize this piece as the chorus of Billy Joel's &lt;i&gt;This Night&lt;/i&gt;, but I think you will find Beethoven got there first.
&lt;p&gt;
With a running time of two minutes and three seconds and a moderate tempo this beautiful sonata has been brought to life again with a soul pop music style arrangement using acoustic and electric guitar, bass, paino, synthesizers and drum samples as well sampled orchestral instruments. This piece of royalty free features quality arrangement skills and a contemporary sound and feel that make this music an excellent opportunity for the media producer to bring out the best in his or her production. Suitable for all kinds of media productions, especially Film production, comedy dramas, animations, video games, documentaries, radio shows and radio jingles.

  <description>This piece of royalty free music, &lt;i&gt;Bach in 21st Century 4&lt;/i&gt;, is a contemporary interpretation of the extremely well known Bach/Gounod piece "Ava Maria".

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Bach in 21st Century 3&lt;/i&gt; is a modern take on &lt;i&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach's&lt;/i&gt; "Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068". Most poeple will instantly recognise this piece as "Air On A G String" which was actually an adaptation of &lt;i&gt;Orchestral Suite No. 3 in D major, BWV 1068&lt;/i&gt; by a nineteenth century violinist named August Wilhelmj. Funnily enough he came up with the title "Air On A G String" because he changed the piece's key from D to C Major and transposed the melody down an octave which meant he could play the whole piece on one string only on his violin, that string not surprisingly being the G string. Bach's orchestral suite was written in the early eighteenth century for his patron, Prince Leopold of Anhalt.
&lt;p&gt;
With a running time of two minutes and four seconds and a moderate tempo this well known Bach classic has been brought to life again with a gentle pop music style arrangement using synthesizers and drum samples as well sampled orchestral instruments. This piece of royalty free music features quality arrangement skills and a contemporary sound and feel that make this music an excellent opportunity for the media producer to bring out the best in his or her production. Suitable for all kinds of media productions, especially Film production, comedy dramas, animations, video games, documentaries, radio shows and radio jingles.

  <description>A modern interpretation of &lt;i&gt;Johann Sebastian Bach's&lt;/i&gt; "Overture No.2 In B Minor: Badinerie". With a running time of one minute and fifty nine seconds a medium tempo this well known Bach classic has been brought to life again with a dance music style backing track using synthesizer bass and drum samples as well sampled orchestral instruments. The piece opens with the unmistakable and unsettling church organ sounds of Bach's &lt;i&gt;Toccata In D Minor&lt;/i&gt; before settling into an energetic rendition of &lt;i&gt;Overture No.2 In B Minor: Badinerie&lt;/i&gt; in a very 21st Century style.

&lt;p&gt; and it is thought that its origins are the Spanish Central Americas around about the time of the early sixteenth century.
In terms of music a Sarabande is in triple metre whereby thesecond and third beats of each bar are often tied and this give the dance a distinctive rhythm of quarter beats and eighth notes in alternation.

  <title>Welcome The New - 3m12s</title>
  <category>Soft Underscores</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-welcome-the-new-3m12s-p-1710.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;Welcome The New&lt;/i&gt; has a running time of three minutes and twelve seconds and a medium tempo of one hundreds and fifty beats per minute. A very attractive smooth jazz piece led masterfully by the acoustic piano's twists, turns, motifs and delicious right hand work. The piano really makes this soft and friendly workout sumptous, welcoming and a cut above. Featuring acoustic piano and guitar, electric piano, electric bass guitar, drums and percussion, &lt;i&gt;Welcome The New&lt;/i&gt; is romantic, sophisticated and very easy on the ear.
&lt;p&gt;
Top musicianship and production skills put this piece of royalty free music in the top drawer. Subtle and tight backing from the drums, bass and guitar leaves the piano space to breathe, the smooth ride cymbals and cheeky electric piano add an restained and tasteful layer, while the contrast brings all the instruments together very neatly. Will suit many types of media applications including film, drama, documentaries, day time television shows, advertising and reality shows.

  <description>&lt;i&gt;Visions&lt;/i&gt; has a running time of two minutes and twenty two seconds and a medium tempo of one hundreds and forty three beats per minute. A lightly orchestrated underscore featuring acoustic piano, acoustic guitar, vibes, orchestral strings and French horn. Very alert and knowing tune perfect for problem solving, crime thrillers and fictional dramas. There is a tense feel to this guitar led piece, the music develops in terms of building the orchestration while the main pensive and slightly uncomfortable melody remains constant.
&lt;p&gt;
A contemporary film underscore with classical and jazz leanings, that develops pace and interest around a single musical theme so very useful for media producers requiring a music bed that reflects a point of focus. Will suit many types of media applications including film, documentaries, thrillers, detective and crime investigation series.

A balanced, secure and  meditative ballad with acoustic piano, acoustic guitar, f horn, clarinet, cello and acoustic bass. Upbeat and encouraging, &lt;i&gt;Trust&lt;/i&gt; has enough movement and contrast to underscore many emotional moments in media productions.
&lt;p&gt;
So a warm and friendly piece of inspirational music with one two twists in the tail. Its nice Americana feel will suit all types of media applications including day time television shows, childrens televsion programs, comedy shows, documentaries, advertising and reality shows.

  <category>Jazz</category>
  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-the-muse-3m55s-p-1707.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;The Muse&lt;/i&gt; has a running time of three minutes and fifty five seconds and a medium tempo of one hundred and twenty five beats per minute. A lightly orchestrated, eccentric and energetic jazz piano tune accompanied by cellos, violin, bowed basses, electric bass guitar, flute, marimba and acoustic drums.
&lt;p&gt;
Witty and colourful this engaging jazz work out remains odd and quirky throughout and helped by its clever orchestration keeps building up until the final note. Chromatic rises and falls seems to take you on a topsy turvy journey through space and time with off the wall piano licks and well organised chord and rhythm movements. Very witty this piece could, at a canter, illustrate a very busy market place or dare I say it the crazy roundabout surrounding the Arc De Triompe.

  <link>http://www.whitebeetle.com/royalty-free-music-my-friends-2m43s-p-1706.html</link>
  <description>&lt;i&gt;My Friends&lt;/i&gt; has a running time of two minutes and forty three seconds and a medium tempo of one hundred and twenty six beats per minute. This delighful tune is written in a very conscise and economical way, a simple and infectious melody is developed throughout with careful additional instrumentation and added light harmony. Acoustic piano and guitar share a childish melody while ukelele provides an offbeat rhythm, freinds arrive, namely double bass and syncopated electric piano and all of a sudden you have a light and enticing jazz piece that swings and hits all the right notes.
&lt;p&gt;
So a wonderfully warm and friendly two-beat jazz tune full of mirth and whimsy that will certainly put a smile on many peoples faces. Its nice Americana feel will suit all types of media applications including day time television shows, childrens televsion programs, comedy shows, documentaries, advertising and reality shows.

A song for contemplation and hope with led by acoustic piano and supported by ukulele, flute, marimba, electric bass guitar and acoustic drums.
&lt;p&gt;
Optimistic and a little introspective this piece is delicately arranged to provide the media producer with a piece that relates to people of all ages with a nice Americana feel that will suit all types of media applications including day time television shows, documentaries, advertising and reality shows.
