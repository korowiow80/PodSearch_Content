	<itunes:summary>In the beginning, there was Jack, and Jack had a groove.
And from this groove came the groove of all grooves.
And while one day viciously throwing down on his box, Jack boldy declared,
“Let there be HOUSE!”
and house music was born.

I’m sure all of you that have read the above quote know it as one of the most infamous house acapellas ever to have graced the house dance floor…. Every true house head and DJ on the planet has either heard it played or has it for that one special moment….
I know I sure know I do!

Jackumentory, is something of a vision, a documentary if you wish to call it, of this acapella and everything that has ever evolved out of house music… everything from the Chicago Jack’in, acid, Latin, tribal/tech house genres that many know and love today the world over…. It’s mission is revive this culture that has taken a back seat in the clubs with the emergence of electro and minimal dance music not that there anything wrong with electro or minimal, it is something that has saturated our clubs, radios and our lives leaving no room for the house music that so many people love… Most of all Jackumentory is about choice, freedom to dance to inspire many to open their minds and hearts to let there be HOUSE!

Call this a revolution! A revolution to inspire many, to restore the great feeling of house music to our beloved play grounds, where we love to dance and let go from daytime routines… a revolution to educate the minds of many new comers to those play grounds of it’s roots and culture… Its sounds… the 4×4 beats and baselines… The Funk! And the heart wrenching vocals that has had its minions raise there hands to the sky with pure emotion screaming because house is a feeling, a way of life, a movement that represents one nation under a groove!

Not only does it represent the history of house music from the past, it is also a vessel for the present and the future of House music…. So expect to hear music that will warm the heart and soul with its funk groove movement… Welcome to the revolution kids!

Houze4Houze!

<p>Hay Peeps,</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s last wednesdays edition of the Jackumentory Experience Radio Show that is broadcast live from London, on www.chicagaohousefm.com. This show was our christmas stocking filler with plenty of umph to get you in the groove!</p>
<p>We were supposed to have a special for you but our guests Nick Dare and Demarkus Lewis both pulled out on the day due to illness, but we are working on rearranging the show for sometime in the near future, so look out for the posts and Facebook event change. Either way it will be on the podcast the day after <img src='http://jackumentory.beatmaven.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />  (or a couple of days after at least).</p>
<p>On my last post I said that I was putting together my big 10 for 2010, and to be honest, this year its been almost impossible to pick my 10 out of all the great releases this year. I might just make it a 20, or even an 11 <img src='http://jackumentory.beatmaven.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  At the moment I&#8217;ve wittled them down to 26 out of the 400/500 + tracks that I have bought during 2010. It might not sound like a great ratio but to be fair, even back in the day when I was out hunting vinyl weekly, sometimes I could go through 300 records in a month and only buy 10 pieces. In a nut shell its been a challenge and that in my book has been a good thing!</p>
<p>So until the next show house heads, happy holidays and all the best as we enter 2011!</p>
<p>Peace Out</p>
<p>MrHun</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wat up peeps!<a href="../files/2010/12/Robb-Swinga1.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="../files/2010/12/Robb-Swinga1-687x1024.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>I hope all is well with you beautiful people and your getting into the festive vibes as Christmas approaches.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I have had a guest on my show and this week’s guest has got me all excited! Robb Swinga, from the big apple, NYC, has kindly given the Jackumentory Experience a super-bad guest mix that really shows his core roots that emanates from the house music that flows out of his home state of N&#8230;ew York! And yes, we are talking about that unmistakeable NY sound, now house music is house music no matter where it is from in the world, and yes, Chicago is the epicentre for our beloved genre of electronic music that has quite literally inspired the world. But we can’t really forget about the contribution NY has made to making house music what it is today on a global scale. If we did then we would be discrediting pioneers like, Tony Humphries, Kenny Dope &amp; Louis Vega (MAW), Mood2Swing, Armand Van Heldon, Todd Terry, and also today’s bad boys the 1200 warriors! Robb Swinga for me fits right in with those guys there, not only does he showcase this with his guest mix, it’s also apparent in his production, especially with his dance floor favourite “Uptown Hoedown” (1200 Traxx) and the more recent EJ’s Groove from the “Northstar EP” on Grovin’ Records. Robb currently has an upcoming release on 1200 Traxx and has remix on the new House Inspectors “Hands UP EP” on Australia’s “Central Music”, which is out now! Check the Link below <img src='http://jackumentory.beatmaven.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>http://www.centralmusic.com.au/</p>
<p>Here’s a 5 for 5 Q&amp;A with Robb Swinga along with his “classic top 10” and a top 10 of “Da Nu Joints”</p>
<p>Da 5 of 5  -</p>
<p>1.1 &#8211; Where do you draw your inspiration from?</p>
<p>My inspiration comes from anywhere really&#8230; people&#8230; situations I’m in&#8230; the music I’m listening to&#8230; the vibe in a club&#8230; the way u can tell is if u see me zoning out.. lol</p>
<p>1.2 &#8211; When did you start producing and DJ&#8217;ing?</p>
<p>I stared DJ’ing house parties when I was 15 years old and released my first production in 2000</p>
<p>1.3 &#8211; If you could be a fly on the wall and sit in on a studio session, which song/artist would you choose and why?</p>
<p>The Roots (Questlove), the way they bring their live feel to what they do appealed to me from day one and then they brought in the Tuba player and I was like WTHA!..lol just an FYI.. I’ve seen them in concert twice, and I don’t really do concerts..lol</p>
<p>1.4 &#8211; Who do you rate in the house scene at the moment?</p>
<p>I see the house scene getting back to where it was appreciated! I see a lot of people getting back to the scene, it’s just about knowing what came before, that’s why I’m glad I see and hear a lot of the classics back in rotation and remixed</p>
<p>1.5 &#8211; Tied in with Q3, what’s your fondest musically moment?</p>
<p>Hearing UPTOWN HOEDOWN in an packed club for the first time in NYC and seeing the crowd go wild..I tell you.. Seeing and feeling the crowd appreciate what you do is something that you take away with you for life!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Surprise!!!</p>
<p>Hey Peeps, is been a very long time since i&#8217;ve posted a show and I wanted to post this weeks show because I finally feel back to my game! I say this because the last 5months have been an up hill task and I&#8217;ve thrown myself into my day job focusing on everything that at the time was important, and then work has been hectic, challenging and something of a self realisation. 10 weeks ago I was drafted into a project team to complete a rebuild project of 1000 computers, yes I work in IT&#8230;. That don&#8217;t make me a geek, I just like messing with technology! ok that does make me a geek, but aren&#8217;t we all?? Anyway, this project&#8230;. I had heard that this project was in the pipeline at work and deep down, I secretly wanted it so I did what I could to be able to get offered to do it&#8230; well it didn&#8217;t happen the way that I expected but apparantly the big boss man heard my name and said &#8220;Ive never met an Attila before, I like that name, lets have him on this&#8230;.&#8221; so I was asked to do it, not for my work eithic nor my unmistakeable people skills charismatic charm&#8230;. But because of my name! Lol Oh well&#8230;. Regardless of this I rouse to the occasion and took the challenge as this was a high stakes project, if it went wrong, things could go really bad&#8230;. If things went right and it was a success, the the opertunities from it where mine for the taking and we&#8217;d have a happy customer! Plus I need it&#8230;. I needed it because I had felt so unchallenged and had being feeling like I was just exsisting and not progressing. I knew I could do it, I knew what was at stake but I just wanted to prove it to myself that I could make it a true success&#8230;. Ive been working in IT for years and done various projects but never anything on this scale and for it all to be completed in the amount of time that was set out, made the task even more challenging&#8230;. never the less the it took just over 7wks, with working anything upto 18hrs a day to oversee and complete each days target across 4 different cities, and what a relief when it was finally over&#8230;. Ive never felt so exhausted&#8230; it took me over a week to recover but also, I realised a lot about my self and have realised that things can improve when you put your head down and just work at it. Yes, theres plenty of points during the whole experience where I could have done better, things we could have done better as a team, but thats part n parcel with projects, or anything we do in life&#8230; I felt that I had grown and made a big personal achievement to tally on to the rest of the great things I have done during my lifes work <img src='http://jackumentory.beatmaven.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> &#8230; but I missed so much of what is important in my life&#8230;. I missed my home, my cats, my music, and most importantly I missed my wife&#8230;. My 1st show back highlighted how much Ive missed doing my radio show and most of all how much I have missed chicagohousefm, I had been without all of these things because I wanted to go out and do this project, achieve something at work, something that I can stand back and say &#8220;I did that&#8230;.&#8221;&#8230;. Thats how I used to feel about all the things that I loved doing and after having some proper time to relax after completing the project, i began to look at my radio shows archieves and thought, I did that too&#8230;. It felt good again! Proud even, the fire within was stoked and rawing&#8230;. I guess I just felt like me again but new, with objectives&#8230;. Its great to be back, and I cant thank all the elements involved enough for bringing me back to this point&#8230;. thanks to all and you!</p>
<p>Anyway, Tonights show was a bit of a last minute shens as Sista Strokes BCH guest Robb Wu was in studio still and I suggested that we go back to back for the show just because we could and it would be hella fun too! And it was just that&#8230;! Good fun, no egos just 3 house heads going 3 for 3 doing something we all love doing, playin music! I let the show do the talking, but I will say this, I was truely honored to have a proper opertunity to spin a couple of tracks with a Robb, the dude is a very down to earth guy and is genuine a lover of music! Its not often you meet good people and Robb is deffinately one of those good people. I hope you enjoy the show people! Many thanks to Robb and Sista Stoke for this one!</p>
<p>Until next week family!</p>
<p>Peace</p>

<p>Goood Eeeeevening All!</p>
<p>I hope everyone is well and happy in their days, and I guess most of all taking full advantage of the summer weather. Let me tell you its real hot here in London and it is looking like holding out and I hope it does because people are happier when the sun is out <img src='http://jackumentory.beatmaven.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>Speaking of heat, this weeks special guest mix is from Brasil&#8217;s 3rd biggest export after football and coffee, we are proud to present to you, ANHANGUERA!!</p>
<p>Anhanguera have a fearsome rep for pleasing crowds all over the world with their energetic dj sets; Dudu and Decio hold true to this by delivering a hot cha-cha-cha of hip swinging beats that even the late  latino beat king Tito Puente would loose his mind too. They are also amoung the new breed of producers to have establised themselves on the underground house scene that are not just firm favourites to the likes Mark Farina, Phill Weeks, Hector Morales, DJ Heather, Bear Who, DJ S, Sista Stroke and yours truely, but to nearly every house dj and dancer out there in the world.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy the mix just as much I did and I thank the boys from Brasil for providing 60mins of joy&#8230;.. So crack open the patrone and get ready to shack out!</p>
<p>Take care PeEpS!</p>
<p>Until Next week&#8230;. 9pm to 11pm GMT on <a title="ChicagoHouseFM" href="www.chicagohousefm.com" target="_blank">www.chicagohousefm.com</a></p>

<p>Here is a recorded show that well, never left the shelf, its fairly recent with some new jams from some of my fav tracks at the moment. It didn&#8217;t make it of the shelf becaus the organ grinder has got me dancing to a tune thats got me working a sweat from dawn till dusk. Sucks, but it dont suck half of much as me not being able to post my podcasts, and most of all, from doing my show!!! You see, over the past few weeks, well actually, 6 weeks infact, my internet service provider has been lame in fixing a fault with my connection, and its got to a point where it drops every couple of hours it just cuts out and then they take for ever sorting it out&#8230;.. VIRGIN MEDIA YOU SUCK! Thanks for all the crap and thats all I am gonna say on the matter.</p>
<p>Although this show is a week or so late, I just couldn&#8217;t go another week not given you anything to listen too, so I have called this show, the Unreleased and Unleashed Edition of the Jackumentory Experience&#8230;.! So I hope that you will enjoy listening just as much as I love doing my shows week in and week out, because without your ears and support I wouldn&#8217;t be fullfilling a dream of mine!</p>
<p>Thank you so much, happy is as happy does!</p>

<p>Hey House Peoples!</p>
<p>Yeah I know it’s been a while since I have posted my show, and I know its lame as I know some of you faithful podcatchers have been deprived of your house musix&#8230;. Well, I think I have made up for it with last week’s show and I think that you will agree once you have heard it, as we had Beatmavens very own Space Academy’s Captain, DJ S, join us for some intergalactic body rocking house grooves&#8230;.</p>
<p>DJ S heralds from the mecca of House, Chicago, where he, like many that embark on an exodus there, learned his trade as a fierce DJ that boldly goes where no man has gone before! lol&#8230;. Right now, you can fellow the man weekly with The Space Academy podcast blog and also, if you happen to be in Seoul, South Korea, you can catch him rocking dance the floor at his weekly residency the Love Lounge with the rest of his Academy compardrez.</p>
<p>DJ’s was kind enough to give us an intriguing interview into how the growth of dance music culture has developed in the far east and how Seoul compares to its neighbouring big brothers, Beijing and Tokyo. Not only that, when I say he graced us with a stellar guest mix&#8230; This guy really laid it down and bare! Now, for thoughs that where listening in to the live show, we had some issues with our internet connection and the broadcast was cut short, which we apologies for and hope to have it sorted soon, but I didn’t want to hold out and deprive you from DJ S’s mix.</p>
<p>So here it is folks, I hope you enjoy it just as much as I have!</p>
<p>And heres his play list!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howdy Peeps,</p>
<p>Here is this week’s instalment of the Jackumentory Experience Radio Show recorded live on <a href="http://www.chicagohousefm.com/">www.chicagohousefm.com</a>.</p>
<p>It was all fun and games on the show despite the technical issues experienced on the night, which again we apologies for, these things happen right! What can you do huh?</p>
<p>Over the past month or 2 (or maybe 3) I have been able to look on the brighter side of life; even though with working and plotting my next step, it’s been a challenge and a welcomed challenge too, so don’t get me wrong, as I am not complaining at all. I just think it’s kinda funny that we each find ways to adapt differently to the situations we all live through, whether it good or bad. I have to admit, but this time last year I was walking a very new road in my life, and looking back I can honestly say that I have discovered a totally new side to myself, it’s more of a trait that my Dad has to be honest which I have adapted to myself, but it’s definitely made me realise a little more about me and the new lessons that I have learned coupled the experiences that I lived through. Strangely, I am glad that I lived through the difficulty of being made unemployed and trying to hold a house together, the debts mount up, but ultimately my perseverance to turn things around to avoid things getting really out of hand and losing all that I have achieved. I mean, I’m married now, have 2 cats, bills, rent and all those other responsibilities that come with it. I’ll be honest with you, I had no idea that things would change the way that they have, but mind you, I never knew what it was like to be walking in the shoes that I am now. And at the moment, I feel that I have a way to go, I like my job and where I work, I am really liking my music and starting to take it a lot more seriously than ever, and I am working on building on these attributes by looking to push myself that much more than ever. This is why I say that I have been able to look on the brighter side of life, because I have found myself in a place where I feel I can really make something happen that will improve the quality of my life without having to feel that I have to fight for it, now I just have to work for it! And that’s something I have never felt before&#8230;.</p>
<p>Thanks for downloading and being part of my groove! See you next week, same time same channel J</p>
<p>Peace and Happiness&#8230;</p>
