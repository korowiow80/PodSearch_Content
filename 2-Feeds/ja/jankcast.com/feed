We went to The Forge Midwest and played a bunch of games. We discuss them. 

Important stuff for you to think about:

RPG Podcast Survey
Jank on Demand! May 19! Come and have fun!
Glitter Guild Benefit Show! May 26! Come and have fun, again!

Main topic (11:22): Forge Midwest Recap
At the Forge Midwest, we played Inspectres, Lady Blackbird, Lords of Waterdeep, House of Cards, Monsterhearts, Final Girl, Psi*Run, Fiasco, and The Sword, The Crown, and the Unspeakable Power. We give a rundown and these games, and talk about the con in general (spoiler: we had fun). 

Rants (1:22:30):
Megan: Don&#039;t Cheat at Games.
Joe: G+ has been killin&#039; it.
Todd: My apartment made me leave Forge Midwest Early.

Took me almost a month to get it up because I&#039;ve been busy with work, but here&#039;s our final session of In a Wicked Age!

We begin with a quick plug for Forge Midwest from Willow Palecek.

Then, at 2:00 we have character creation.
The game itself starts at 36:21.
Finally, we have a short discussion about the game starting at 2:54:59.

Enjoy!

Please note, we get a little punchy by the end, by which I mean folks get their drink on.</itunes:summary>

This is a bonus one-shot we did of Meg Baker&#039;s sweet new game Psi*Run.

The game starts right away after a short intro by Todd, then we play for about 2 hours and end with a review/discussion of the game that starts at 2:07:35.

The game is about amnesiacs who wake up remembering very little about who they are, but discovering that they have psychic powers and are being chased by some nefarious force who wants to do them harm. The mechanics revolve around trying to answer a series of questions the players have about who their characters are.

Joe GMs (which in this game means he plays the chasers and frames scenes) and Megan, Scott, Timo, and Todd play the totally anti-social bunch of jerks who are the amnesiacs in this game.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>There is a trend in games to have a core mechanic that creates a real thing:  A map, a story, a written set of relationships.  There&#039;s this interesting thing about having a real record, some object that comes out of the game that you can refer back to you.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>Sometimes gaming can be a great therapeutic resource.  The cast goes in to a conversation about how that looks and what drives that kind of play.  We have on Sarah Lynne Bowman.  Sarah received her PhD from the University of Texas at Dallas in 2008. McFarland press published her dissertation in 2010 under the title The Functions of Role-playing Games: How Participants Create Community, Solve Problems, and Explore Identity. Her current research focuses upon understanding social conflict within role-playing communities and applying Jungian theory to the phenomenon of character immersion.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>So this week we did something a little different: Todd did a cast with his group which started via school, several of whom weren&#039;t gamers until recently and the rest of whom hadn&#039;t gamed since high school. Most gaming podcasts, understandably, feature people who have been into the hobby for a long time. We thought it would be an interesting take to get to hear from some people who are brand new to the hobby or just got back into it after a decade or more away to get a somewhat different perspective on this little thing we call role-playing.

		<itunes:subtitle>Gaming Advice and the Conversation on Gaming</itunes:subtitle>
		<itunes:summary>Timo read some interesting blog posts about the nature of the conversation about gaming after the explosion of Independent games and brought the conversation to the table.  As part of that conversation we end up talking about the whole blowup that happened surrounding the rise of Forge Game theory and &quot;System Matters.&quot;  The conversation goes longer than usual, but we end up talking about the role of gaming advice and what character it takes.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>The cast sits down and talks about how character flaws are handled in game.  We discuss some of our favourite types of flaws, how we play to or against them, and how different games make use of them.  At some point, wild accusations are made, and we have a guest appearance by a Ethan, a local who was in the store creating a character as we were recording.</itunes:summary>

Main topic: Breaking/Broken games (28:50)
We love our broken games, but that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re perfect.  And even the most well designed game can be broken, if you put your mind to it.  It&#039;s fun to sometimes push the boundaries, to test the engine and see how it chugs along.  We discuss some of the characteristics of broken games and the breaking of games, and how it&#039;s different from drifting rules.

		<itunes:summary>Here is the actual actual play portion of the actual play. 

If you didn&#039;t listen the the character/world creation posted yesterday, you might be a little confused (hell, you might be confused even if you did!) so here&#039;s a quick rundown:

-Todd is GMing, which means in Misspent Youth that he&#039;s &quot;The Authority.&quot; The Authority we created for our game is a sort of hyper-capitalist oligarchy called &quot;The Board,&quot; who are making everyone update their &quot;social stock tickers&quot; (the little watches which measure how much a human being is worth) to 2.0 soon.  

-Timo is playing Levi, the rich son of a board member who likes to rebel against his father&#039;s authority.

-Rob is Jet, a punk hacker who&#039;s gotten in trouble for messing with people&#039;s social stock tickers.

-Charles is Samara, Jet&#039;s innocent little sister, ignored by their parents.

-Megan is Kira, an arty, misfit girl from the wrong side of the tracks, with &quot;part-timer&quot; parents. 

-Reek is Warner, a handsome and popular kid with an attitude.</itunes:summary>

		<itunes:summary>We talk a little about that weird thing that one person has to do in most games:  Gm.  It&#039;s fraught with a lot of responsibilities and is treated differently in a bunch of different games.  What do we see as the characteristics of the GM (or whatever his name might be), and how do they affect or guide the story at hand?

Main topic: What is a GM  (28:35)
Playing games which spread the Gming among players makes Megan more willing to GM (29:15)
GMing like you&#039;re a director not a storyteller (30:10)
The fun ringleader (31:20)
Name calling and what they imply: Dungeon Master, Games Master, Storyteller, Master of Ceremonies, the Authority, the Fool, and others (32:00)
Break in action to discuss Lexx&#039;s HS football picture (34:10)
Effective/defining things GM&#039;s do (35:35)
Using film terminology: screenshots, montage ending in Fiasco, Zombie Cinema. (40:00)
Scenes-based games: Misspent Youth (42:20)
non-film descriptiveness (43:00)
comic and cartoons: increased importance, increased detail a la Scott McCloud&#039;s Understanding Comics (44:00)
Megan&#039;s living 1st ed game: what are good advice for new GM&#039;s? (48:15)
The Authority in Misspent Youth is not very Gm-like (59:15)
More authority the GM has, the more a player can focus on their character: Remember Tommorrow as an example (01:00:25)
the stereotypes: Trad versus Story gaming (01:01:30)
Last word from Scott:  Gm is not God, God is one of the GM&#039;s NPC&#039;s (01:02:40)

Rants (01:03:00)
Scott: I&#039;m very interested in characters because it&#039;s hard to find new stories.
Megan: Let people play their own games.
Todd: Fuck you, Vegas Wedding Planners.</itunes:summary>

For this episode, we were SUPPOSED to talk about character death with a full cast, but some people cancelled (coughMajdicough) and other people didn&#039;t show up (coughJohnKellycough).  At first, Lexx and Todd said &quot;maybe we should just call it.&quot;  Then they looked deep into each others eyes in the most manly of ways and realized that true heroes, real heroes, carry on no matter what.  Like a couple of Vikings they went into battle, recording a full cast with just the two of them.  Bards will sing of this heroic tale for generations, calling it &quot;the greatest accomplishment ever by two humans.&quot;

Too much?  Yeah.  Okay.  Mostly it&#039;s just Lexx and me shooting the shit about the current games we&#039;re playing.  If that sounds interesting to you, listen and enjoy, if it doesn&#039;t, we&#039;ll be back next week with a full cast episode.

		<itunes:summary>The Love Cast is a little old place where we can get together.

Love Cast, baby.

Hosts: Cass, Courtney, Famous Game Designer Majdi Badri, JOHNKELLY, Todd


Bumper: Chair in your pocket/giant bird

Banter: Chair in your pocket, cont.  JohnKelly doesn&#039;t get a free donut.  Todd is a liar and JohnKelly is a drunk.  Majdi bought Clue.  Star Wars Guess Who.  Star Wars 3D.  Captain EO/Courtney Likes Disney/Disney Hall in 3D/Closet Adventures (we&#039;re on a roll!).   Courtney doesn&#039;t want to be here and thinks Majdi and JohnKelly are assholes (Todd is making this up).   Majdi&#039;s ladyfriend may or may not exist.  Majdi is THE INFEKTOR!  Famous Game Designer Majdi Badri&#039;s next game will be &quot;Dr. Touchem.&quot;  Max Cadwell.  Peter is confused.  Courtney wonders why Courtney has a microphone.  Toddworth.

What did we play this week?
JohnKelly: Nothing, because Matt is stupid.
Famous Game Designer Majdi Badri: Pathfinder
Todd: Sorcerer and Vampire
Courtney: Battleheart
Cass: Nothing (but D&amp;D is coming up)

Topic: Gaming with significant others.

How has Famous Game Designer Majdi Badri tricked his ladyfriends into gaming?
Courtney likes to levelgrind so JohnKelly suggests 316.
Make your significant other comfortable if you want them to game with you.
A spoonful of booze makes the game go down.
Magic + Logic = A whole different game.
Collaborative boardgames.
Nerdy media = nerdy gamers.
Forbidden Island, the game to sucker your significant other into gaming with.
Problems with gaming with a significant other: myth or reality?
Rants:
Courtney and Todd: Your friends suddenly turn conservative when you get old/No grades = no grammar.
JOHNKELLY: Columbia College, Under the Bus.
Cass: Dunkin Donuts doesn&#039;t have turkey sausage, but says it does.  Jerks.
Majdi: No Angry Birds in the dark.

Today, in response to the Walking Eye&#039;s recent episode on rules drifting, we tackle the subject.  I won&#039;t say we did it better, but our cast definitely had 100% more of Scott&#039;s mustache.  

Bumper: Timo.  What a maroon.   

Banter: Timo is late.  Megan&#039;s show.  Todd gets internet yelled at.  Super Sweet 16 sucks.  Bobcat Godthwait will kill those girls in a movie.  Birthdays.  We make fun of Timo more.  JohnKelly does a surprisingly good impression of him.  Can we edit Timo into the cast from older casts?  Scott&#039;s mustache of power (aka, the SLEAZSTACHE).  

What did we play?
Megan: Magic, Lady Blackbird, Nightfall
JohnKelly: Fiasco (but wrong)
Scott: Battletech
Todd: Lady Blackbird, Serenity
Timo: Lady Blackbird

Topic: Topic, topic, topic, topic, topic.  Where were we?  Oh yeah.  Rules and house rules.  We are in dialogue with the Walking Eye who did a convo on drifting the rules with Ryan Macklin, John Wick, the awesomely named Eddy Webb, and our arch-nemesis WEIIIIIIIIISEEEEEEERRRR!

What is a rule?  Mechanics?  Advice?  Social contract?  All three?  Anything in the book, including &quot;the&quot; and &quot;and&quot; is a rule.  Also- don&#039;t be a dick.  
You have drifted the rules, which is 100% okay, if you change the setting.  
We get a little glimpse into JohnKelly&#039;s psyche.
The Golden Rule- Change what you want.  
Todd didn&#039;t know that West Side Story is based on Romeo and Juliet.  But he did.  He&#039;s lying.  
No one seems to care if people drift rules.  Does everyone do it?  
Does it make a difference if you&#039;re playing a &quot;trad game&quot; or an &quot;indie game&quot;?  Why drift the rules in Lady Blackbird, for example?  
Shouldn&#039;t you give them game a try the way it is?  
Todd wants to know if a game is broken.  
JohnKelly thinks you can&#039;t mess up Call of Cthulhu.  
What can you mess up?
Does anyone run D&amp;D with the rules totally straight?  
It&#039;s always combat that gets drifted, isn&#039;t it?
Slowing the game down.  Is it momentum or time we&#039;re worried about?
Narrative and mechanics coming together, for example, Dogs in the Vineyard.  If you can drift the rules and not affect the narrative at all, what does this mean?
Role-playing is, in effect, a drift.  
Transparency.
Why wouldn&#039;t anyone change the grapple rules?  
To demonstrate this, Scott grapples JohnKelly.  
Run it as right as you can, first, then change it.
Rules are there for a reason.  
If you&#039;re drifting the rules of a game, there&#039;s probably a different game you can play that would do what you want it to do.  Go buy it.  
Two comes after one.

Rants: 
Megan: Magic!  Know your audience.  
Timo got rid of his TV for free.  What&#039;s wrong with America?
JohnKelly: Gary Gygax tells you what to do from the afterlife.
Todd: Fuck Terry Jones.  Seriously.  
Scott: Condolences to Jolly Blackburn&#039;s family.  See below.

Auction for Jolly&#039;s Family
Cosplay for a Cause at Pressure!

Hosts: Ben, Lexx, Megan, Rob, Scott


Show notes: 

Bumper: Canadians.  

Banter: Putting unpleasantness behind us.  SuckerPunch is dumb, but pretty.  Feed your head!  I should sue SuckerPunch.  Sounds good to me.  Squids.  Autotuning.  Happy birthday Nathan Fillion.

Topic: Anthropomorphic gaming.  Like, serious non-humans.  

Question one: Sex.  Obviously.  
Sentient free willed beings that want GOOOOOOOOLD!!!!!
Archetypes or arbitrary types?  Are non-human characters just a focus on one aspect of humanity?
We&#039;re still dealing with things that are mostly human.
Human/animal hybrids.  
Isn&#039;t this just what roleplaying is?  
What&#039;s interesting about this: we can explore the dualism of humanity.  Rational/animal.  
Was Whitewolf was going for this conflict in Werewolf?  
Rob likes to play characters that have an animalistic side because he likes to role-play something that isn&#039;t him.  
Dawg the RPG: Canine Compulsion rules.  
Lexx is rigid.  Ben is open to the secrets of the universe. 
Watership Down, the cartoon.  
&quot;A strange desire for carrots and sex, not necessarily in that order.&quot;  
Rob puts his book learnin&#039; to good use: KAFKA!
JANK CAST: MAKIN&#039; IT UP!
Sorcerer = What Kafka could be.  
The danger of playing an alienated character.  
Act out because you have an interesting character, not because you want to be transgressive for the sake of transgression.  
The sociology of animals.
Inevitably, dolphins come up.
Ratten!

Rants: 
Ben: Manly commercials think men are stupid and women are harpies.  This seems incorrect.  
Scott: The circle of death.
Rob: Sykpe group video blew it.  
Lexx: Furries.  
Megan: Everyone at the fest got the flu.

Also: Megan will perform nerd themed burlesque at GenCon.  Woot.

Banter: Todd&#039;s neighbors bring the funk.  Scott&#039;s back from China and he brought show and tell!  IHOP has fried chicken and waffles.  Sweet.  Halal KFC leads to CHICKENGEDDON!  Sweet Chinese mugs.  We&#039;re not sexist here on the Jank Cast.  We get our Pocky on.  TROLLJERGEN!!!  The Windy City Burlesque Fest: Megan brings the boobs to Chicagoland.  Coming attractions on the Jank: THE CAST OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BOOBS!  Kids these days.  Majdi is a celebrity and is, hence, too good for us now. 

What did we play?
JK: D&amp;D and Stratego
Scott: Wrath of Ashardalon
Todd: Lady Blackbird, Serenity, Zombie Cinema
Charles: Lady Blackbird, Zombie Cinema, Dresden Files

Main Topic: As part of our Media and Gaming series: COMIC BOOKS!  
Scott talks about C2E2
Scott claims that Corey Glover from Living Colour is Danny Glover&#039;s son.  He isn&#039;t.  But it&#039;s a sweet rumor, so just keep telling everyone he is.  Either way, click here for awesomeness.    
Scott&#039;s definition of a perfect woman.  
What can comic book storytelling teach us about gaming?  
It&#039;s a discrete story.  
We&#039;re going to talk about Batman.  A lot.  
Comic books can give visuals but also text description.  
What&#039;s so Civil about War anyway?
They have a very complicated world with lots of characters.
Our Valued Customers
We can use them as inspiration for how to plot a game.
Understanding Comics by Scott McCloud: Aspect to Aspect Storytelling.
The arrangement of panels on a page is a part of storytelling.
Locke and Key
Usagi Yojimbo: Telling a story just with visuals.  
Blah Blah Blah: our new game.  
Don&#039;t attack Superman&#039;s strengths, attack his weaknesses.
Who is the Villain?  
Favorite superhero systems to play.  Suggestions:
Godlike/Wild Talents
BASH
Mutants and Masterminds
Capes
Mutant City Blues
Marvel Superheroes
Aberrant
Heroes Unlimited
How do you balance a superhero system?  Should you even bother?  JohnKelly says maybe.  Todd says no, just skip the realism and balance and go right to outcomes.  
Todd says &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; but means &quot;Wonderman.&quot;  
We complain about some of the superhero posters on the wall of Chicagoland Games.  

Rants: 
JohnKelly: Have you seen this Majdi?
Scott: Future trains!
Charles: Most positive rant ever.  
Todd: Wonder Woman is having a rough time

We start out talking about when you&#039;re playing a game where the &quot;party&quot; isn&#039;t a &quot;party,&quot; so to speak.  This shifts to a discussion about how system fits into this along with how a balance of character goals vs. group goals shape this.  Also: Canada.  

Shhhhhhhhnotes:

Bumper: OH CANADA!

Banter: Todd resealed his Dunkin&#039; Donuts coffee.  This makes sense because of, you know, filth.  Toilet propaganda: know your system, know yourself.  Somehow we get talking about something being broken and RPG karaoke.  I have no idea what this is all about.  The Jank Cast hasn&#039;t jumped the shark, but we&#039;re definitely Chasin&#039; Steve.  Finnish people have issues with women.  Black Metal.  Scandinavians hate each other.  The Z-axis of comedy.  

What we played:
Ticket to Ride
Dixit
Jewish Apples to Apples
Dragon Age II
Serenity  

Tangent: Peepsville.

Topic: Games where the characters aren&#039;t a &quot;party.&quot;  

Does a game&#039;s mechanics drive your towards party play or non-party play?  We say some games do.  For example: Fiasco, Shock, and The Mist-Robed Gate drive you away from party play with their conflict/audience mechanics.  

Story-telling vs. Task oriented gaming?  

Social norms around the table: are you the audience if your not &quot;in scene?&quot;  

Human Contact- Coming out soon!  

Remember Tomorrow: a task oriented game where you&#039;re probably not a party.

Timo has a threeway with Pluto and Pluto (the dog and the planet, respectively).  

Timo doesn&#039;t like Gwenyth Paltrow.  Reek doesn&#039;t either, apparently.  Why are we mad about Gwenyth Paltrow?  Who knows.  

The Wire is character driven storygaming.  

Does the game need you to have a &quot;balanced party&quot; and shared goals or not?  D&amp;D often does.  Zombie Cinema?  In a Wicked Age?  Not so much.  

Apocalypse World and creating PC-NPC-PC triangles.  Dogs in the Vineyard, too.  Vincent Baker is good at this.  Reek loves Vincent Baker but doesn&#039;t want to admit it, so he decides he has a new enemy.  BAKER!    

We discuss definitions of sexuality and Reek attempts to be a gentleman in front of a lady, for a change.  

Todd says &quot;rim planet&quot; and all hell breaks loose.  It takes Reek two minutes to contain himself.  

What do people expect from the game?  How do you give it to them?

Canada: The RPG.  Rob, painted in blood, chasing people with a machete.  NOW THE HUNT BEGINS!  

Rules again: what do they let you do as far as attacking someone, talking to someone, etc.  

Does a system give you the freedom to do exactly what you want with your character narratively, or are you shackled to realism?  Fiasco lets you do whatever you want.  Godlike didn&#039;t.  

How do you GM a character driven game?  In the same way you play a character as a PC.    

Lady Blackbird as a great example of a game that lets you decide the fate of your character.  

Static relationships vs. dynamic relationships.  Is this a result of having an external goal?  

Sorcerer: goals that don&#039;t intersect at all.  This allows you to create dramatic irony at the table.  

We become more convinced this is all about how much the group has a goal which unites them vs. how much the individual characters have conflicting goals.  

Party games are fun, rewarding, and you can do awesome character stuff in them.  That&#039;s not the issue.  

Rants:
Timo: Try a new game, people!
Rob: Interviews suck.  
Reek: Carrie.
Todd: Fuck plate tectonics.  Also: wait a few minutes before you start making the bad jokes about tragedy.  Assholes.

Donate to the Red Cross by texting REDCROSS to 90999.

In this episode, we discuss how to manage your work/gaming balance.  And Megan is tired.  Very, very tired.  

Show Notes:
Banter: The worst show ever.  LOOK AT MY TEXT!!!  OH MY GOD!!!!  We&#039;re tired.  Todd&#039;s ladyfriend&#039;s parents are in town and he&#039;s too embarrassed to introduce them to the people on the cast.  The other &quot;Megan Pedersen&quot; gets thrown under the bus.

What Games Did We Play? (10:10): We finished up Godlike.  The less we used the mechanic, the better it was.  Greg Stolze agrees, interestingly enough.

12:30- THE SNEEZE!

The other Spider Man Musical. 

Kickstarter.com is a thing.

The Robocop Statue.

In the future... there will be Huck Finn.

Main Topic: Work/Game balance (19:00)
Todd Doesn&#039;t have time to do high prep GMing anymore.  Neither does JohnKelly (so he just doesn&#039;t GM).
Work never ends for most of us so we have to schedule fun around work.
We almost never miss the weekly game, even when we&#039;re busy.
Reek&#039;s life.  Beefquest.
Tangent: Steven Tyler sucks hard.
JohnKelly wants to do one game a week, at least.
Gaming to escape?  Gaming as a creative outlet?  Do you want to get something out of gaming that you don&#039;t get out of work?
Megan is highbrow.
What does &quot;escapist&quot; mean?  Are we really trying to &quot;escape&quot; from work?
&quot;Gaming with Strangers.&quot;

Rants! (51:30)
Todd: A Public Service Announcement
Megan: Bad student interview
Reek: All work and no play makes Reek a something something
JohnKelly- Drive Angry (what Todd&#039;s friend Marnie calls &quot;NIXSPLOITATION!&quot;).  Nicolas Cage flips his shit!

Gaming and theme are an interesting thing:  It may or may not be a thing that is strongly expressed, desired or even present.  But what role it takes in game play and how it affects the game and the players is an interesting topic, and one that we try to address with some breadth and depth.  We may or may not succeed: We might just end up punning.  It will be upon you to find out.

Word of warning, the quality is a little poorer with this one simply because we did not have our microphones and were using a laptop microphone.  Also we eat some delicious delicious food as we cast.  Behold, our majesty!

Banter: Themeless writing, we realise we&#039;re bantering,  We then turn what we played in to big discussion of creative agenda kind of stuff.

What we played this week (3:50)
Megan: Godlike, Magic:The Gathering, Mansions of Madness
Todd: Arkham Horror, Serenity

Main topic: Theme (21:59) 
Vincent Baker&#039;s post on Anyway (22:10)
Misspent Youth has theme, issues, situation (24:10)
Choice leads to theme: preconceived theme a la Darths and Droids (25:50)
Gaming to affirm a theme (28:50)
Character theme or leitmotifs (30:40)
interplay between personal and overarching theme (33:00)
Is it worthwhile to force a common theme? (35:45)
The Wire as an example of changing theme(37:00)
Different medias express theme differently (38:40)
Do players (not characters) have themes? (40:30)
Theme of our Apocalypse World game (43:30)
Looking for theme in gaming is rough (45:40)
So what&#039;s the point of theme in gaming? (48:00)
System working with and against theme (49:30)
Gaming is not a genre (aka Todd throws down some big words) (52:15)
George Polti, gaming as communal storytelling (54:15)
Rob lays down the etymological knowledge (55:35)

Rants (57:00)
Reek: No homo?  what the fuck?
Todd: Being asked for autographs is an aweful experience.
Megan:  Come up with a signature (Behold the Ravening Maw!), Megan is coming down to Kansas
Rob:  I don&#039;t rant, I&#039;m Canadian
Charles and Akure don&#039;t like to rant, but they make awesome hosts
Timo: What&#039;s wrong with my hair? interposed stories about the neighbours sexlife, why isn&#039;t there more bird-of-prey sex?

In which we discuss Doctor Who and how it may relate to gaming.  We&#039;ll do this sort of thing from now on.  Spoiler alert: there are spoilers!  You&#039;ve been warned.

1:06- Oh yeah?  Why don&#039;t you go blog about it?
2:30- Facebook v. Boobs.
4:23- Welcome to the Jank Cast!  It&#039;s the Doctor Who cast and JohnKelly didn&#039;t show up, even though it was his idea.  We make-a-the-jokes.
5:00- Show might be a little loud because of a store event.
We&#039;ll post the 12 hours of actual play.
5:30- What&#039;d we play?  UMLAUT: THE GAME OF METAL!!!  How do you play a whole band?
6:55- Min-maxing your band: Raw Black Metal bands are hosed!
10:45- Megan played Magic: the Slouching.
11:10- Serenity.  We need to talk.  Everyone&#039;s character is too damn libertarian.
12:24- HOORAY FOR PLAYING GAMEZ!!!!!!
12:30- Talking about Doctor Who.  Todd whistles the Doctor Who theme.  Why does no one stop him?  Insert Tardis Noise here.  Todd doesn&#039;t.
13:00- Kicking off a new series: nerdy media and what we can learn about gaming from it.
13:40- John Kelly is the voice of a new generation.  At least according to his superfan.  Shout out to JK&#039;s superfan: what&#039;s up, dude?
14:20- The Doctor Who Roleplaying Game- good gateway game.
15:00- Primeval game?  Neat.
15:10- Megan is watching every Doctor Who episode she can from the beginning.  Hey, look at all the retconing!
17:25- Consistent World vs. Character Dramady?
18:30- Megan likes the episodes where The Doctor goes to random historical locations.
19:00- Joe doesn&#039;t like Doctor Who because shit ain&#039;t real.
20:40- The Doctor teaches us how to do good character moments.
21:20- Megan don&#039;t like time-travel.  In Doctor Who it&#039;s a MacGuffin, though.
23:08- &quot;I&#039;m sorry.  I&#039;m so, so sorry.&quot;
24:30- Relationships between aliens and humans: similar, or different?  Scott thinks humans are pets.  Porno for Pyros agrees.  NINETIES FTW!
25:40- Alien morality &lt; human morality.
27:05- How do you use power?
27:20- Humans shouldn&#039;t be able to make decisions.
28:28- When you don&#039;t get your props it can be romantic.  Huh?
29:00- Choices have consequences.
30:05- The Whoniverse is atheist, and thus takes life experiences very seriously.
31:45- Pregnancy in L5R
33:10- Favorite companion?  Martha Jones.  Obviously.
34:45- Doctor Who villains.  Single minded, non-human logic.  Delicious.
41:45- Permanence and consequences.  Heavy, man.
