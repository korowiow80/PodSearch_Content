			<itunes:author>Mixed by Otto and Adam</itunes:author>
			<description>Jamjar Session 010. The Final Mix - It’s been a while but then so has the last time Adam and Otto played a Jamjar set. In April 2009 we once again joined the Deep Rooted crew at Anam Bar in Islington, London for what was to be our last set together as Jamjar Sessions. Lucky for you, we had the good foresight to record the set. So here then is Jamjar Session 010 The Final Mix, recorded live!</description>

			<title>Jamjar Session 009</title>
			<itunes:author>Mixed by Otto</itunes:author>
			<description>Jamjar Session 009. It's been a long wait, but the wait is finally over, Session 009 is here! This Jazz inspired warm-up set gets things going at a gentle 106 BPM and peaks at a toe-tapping, jazz hands in the air, 123 BPM. Inspired by my discovery of Wouda, who seamlessly introduces traditional jazz elements into his productions, this mix features three of his tracks! (highly unusual for Otto). The rest of the mix is littered with jazz elements. Look out for some classic St Germain too! </description>

			<itunes:author>Mixed by Otto</itunes:author>
			<description>Our first Jamjar Session is mixed by Otto. As our resident warm-up junky, Otto usually delivers mid tempo deep house or downtempo lounge sets. This time round, however, he delivers a very tech, almost progressive set, yet always remains deep. With rich padded synths, steady progression and flawless mixing, those who know Otto’s sound may be surprised by his latest offering. Enjoy!</description>
