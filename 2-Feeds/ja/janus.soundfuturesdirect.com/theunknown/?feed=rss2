<p>NEW ORLEANS: circa 1838. Founded in 1718 by the Spanish, the Gulf of Mexico port city of New Orleans was a thriving center of commercial and social activity. With heavy Spanish, French and Native American influences, the city was well known as the slave trade center of the New World. West Africans, Haitians and other Caribbean cultures were being forced into the disgusting slave market, a blemish on the history of man. After a successful revolution in Haiti, many free black plantation owners relocated to Southern Louisiana and re-established their operations near New Orleans as well.</p>
<p>It was a city of immigrants, including German, Irish, Cuban, French and Spanish; a city where pleasures could be bought and sold for a price and where a strange mix of ancient religion with Catholic overtones was emerging. From magical spells and potions to more sinister dark magic rituals, New Orleans had become a troubled and superstitious city full of chance opportunity and horrible repression, a contrast of all things good and all things evil. Amid the ranks of the Creole came a legendary woman, Marie Laveau, who became the infamous Queen of Voodoo, and far worse, an initiate of Laveau, socialite Delphine LaLaurie, who crafted her way into the local history books with acts of unreasonable cruelty and unfathomable acts of horror and dark magic.</p>
<p>On All Hallows Eve, join us for a remarkable and true story of the Voodoo Queen and socialite who came to be known as the Devil&#8217;s Wife&#8230;accented by an original score from the accomplished composer Janus&#8230; Lock the doors tightly, and don&#8217;t listen alone.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT</span> PLEASE READ</p>
<p>We are delighted to announce the following very special notice.</p>
<p><a href="http://soundfuturesdirect.com">Mind Quest Radio</a> has just been officially launched today.It is the dream-child and creative partnership of author, writer and broadcaster Logan Hawkes and composer and recording artist  Janus.Both already recognised as leading lights and pioneers in their respective professions, their vision of combining their love of the old style radio theatre dramas and of bringing them straight into the 21st century for audiences to immerse themselves into again.As a direct result of this exciting development this supersedes the existing Unknown Radio Show series and the forthcoming  shows from this particular site.All future shows and productions from today onwards will now appear when available at the new official <a href="http://soundfuturesdirect.com">Mind Quest Radio</a> site.Please join us there where our journeys continue further into the unknown from now on.Mind Quest Radio is located at <a href="http://soundfuturesdirect.com">http://soundfuturesdirect.com</a></p>
