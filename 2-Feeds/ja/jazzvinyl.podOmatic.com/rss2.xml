      <title>Early jazz piano solos from Fats Waller </title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/40890/600x600_1377337.gif&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Jazz Vinyl Lovers,

Finally I've managed to find another piece of . At last...!

&lt;strong&gt;::: Rediscovered Early Solos from Fats Waller ::: 1923 - 1927&lt;/strong

The  vinyl was released in New York City by Bill Grauer Productions. 

The dozen solos on the record were made as player-piano rolls, between 1923 and 1927, by a young musician named &lt;strong&gt;Thomas Waller&lt;/strong&gt;, the son of a Harlem minister. Young Waller was barely beginning to make a name  for himself in Harlem theaters, at small clubs and at the fabulous rent parties of that era.

But all the qualities that were to make him one of the major figures of jazz are already in evidence - the vibrant power, the exuberance, the intricate imagination, the sudden dazzling runs. Fats was never to become much better than this; he was just to become very much more appreciated.

One of the most rewarding of these piano-roll discoveries, this collection actually serves to emphasize an aspect of Fats' genius that has been somewhat obscured by his subsequent fame as a singing showman: his remarkable skill as a jazz artist. Enjoy ;-)

Tracklist:

- Squeeze me
- You can't do what my last man did
- Laughin' cryin blues
- Don't try to make my man away
- Got to cool my doggies now
- Nobody but my baby
- A new kind of man with a new kind of love for me
- Tain't nobody's biz-ness if  I do
- 18th street strut
- Your time now
- Papa better watch your step
- Snake hips

Yours truly,

Fresh Sounds

      <title>Sidney Bechet - Le Disque d'Or Vinyl</title>

I am proud to let you know that the Jazz Vinyl Podcast has passed over 85.000 subscribers! Again, thank's for listening &amp; commenting on the podshows! I hope from my jazz heart, that I can share more jazz vinyl jewels with you... also I have to admit that sometimes it's quite difficult to find new pieces. I'll keep on searching for you!

Enough talking/writing...let's celebrate the high subscriber rate with another jazz vinyl jewel from.... Sidney Bechet. I've found this album from him a while ago: &quot; Le disqe d'Or de Sidney Bechet&quot;. A nice compilation piece of vinyl.

Combined on this record are the biggest successes of the time when Sidney was in France, that is to say, the time when this extraordinary artist was an exceptional improviser and a wonderful composer.

On this record, the memory of Sidney Bechet still lives on as the orchestra of Claude Luter and Andre Reweliotty play his biggest successes, for it was with Claude Luter and Andre that Sidney played for the last ten years of his live.

::: Sidney Bechet - Le Disque d'Or :::

Tracklist:

- Petite fleur
- Promenade aux Champs Elys&#233;es
- Passport to paradise
- As-tu le cafard?
- Marchand de poissons
- Si tu vois ma m&#232;re
- Les oignons
- Premier bal
- Dans les rues d'antibes
- Temperamental
- Roses de picardie
- Summertime

      <title>Basie's Best - Count Basie and His Orchestra Jazz Vinyl</title>
      <description>Dear Jazz Vinyl Lover,

It took me some time to find another Jazz Vinyl Jewel.. but finally I can share another one with you ;-)

I recently found a record from Count Basie, titled &quot;Basie's Best - Count Basie and His Orchestra&quot;

As you all know, Count Basie has directed one of the finest jazz dance bands in history. His music is so powerfull that it has survived through the years when the &quot;Big Bands&quot; were dropping by the wayside.

This collection contains some of the Count's priceless recordings for listening - and they are also very danceable. For added value there are some classic blues solos by Mr. Blues himself, Jimmy Rushing. 

So enjoy the cream of The Count in the Forties - and there ain't nothing any creamier!

:: Basie's Best - Count Basie and His Orchestra :: 

Tracklist:

- One o'clock jump
- Red bank boogie
- It's sand man !
- Jimmy's Blues (vocals: Jimmy Rushing)
- The mad boogie
- Avenue c
- The king
- Taps miller
- Rusty dusty blues (vocals: Jimmy Rushing)
- Rambo

Enjoy ;-) 

Yours truly,

Fresh Sounds

Dear Jazz Vinyl Lover,

It has taken me some more time to get a new Jazz Vinyl Jewel posted...so I'm proud to present you a new one this week from the King of Jazz Piano: Erroll Garner.

Trackl list:

- Body and soul
- Laura
- Red sails in the sunset
- I can't believe that you're in love with me
- Stardust
- More than you know
- All of me
- All the things you are
- On the sunny side of the street
- Penthouse serenade
- I only have eyes for you
- I surrender dear
- Confessin'
- September song
- I'm in the mood for love
- Rosalie
