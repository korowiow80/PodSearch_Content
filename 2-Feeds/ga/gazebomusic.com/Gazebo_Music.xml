<title>Outta Sight Holiday Show 2007!</title>
<itunes:author>Nathan Moomaw</itunes:author>
<link>http://www.gazebomusic.com</link>
<description><![CDATA[It's that time of the year again.  Yes, you've got it right, The Holidaze!  I've already started gaining weight so I can fit into my Santa suit a little bit better.  And to celebrate myself and the other fellahs at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/outtasightnight" target="_blank">Outta Sight</a> hosted a holiday show the day before Thanksgiving here in San Francisco.  It was a wonderful night filled with ... well booze, but music, too, some technical difficulties and the rest of the expected lovelies that the Outta Sight nights come with.  It truly was a merry time at the Edinburgh Castle.  If I do say so myself, this podcast has got to have some of the worst sound quality of any that I've ever done.  HOWEVER, it's fantastic, and I heartily encourage you and gather around your computer with your family this holiday season and warm chestnuts on its screen.  And rest assured, the sound quality does improve some by the end of the recording.  Unfortunately we did suffer some losses, and due to the technical difficulties I'm missing the songs of a few of the wonderful performers (including Blue Rabbit, Il Gato and Andrew Burmester.. sorry kids!)  But as I mentioned above, this is still a wonderful capture of holiday songs!  Here's a tracklisting:<br /><br />

[1] Nathan Moomaw (me) leads off the night with a cover of LWIII's "Wine with Dinner"<br />
[2] Raul Sanchez follows with a sweet version of Gloria<br />
[3-4] Aubrey Anderson then plays wonderful covers of Elton John's "Step into Christmas" and Elvis's "Blue Christmas<br />
[5-6] Dusty DiMercurio and Ben Kasman take us on a Peanut's filled trip into "Silent Night" and then "Christmas Time is Here" featuring Amanda from Blue Rabbit<br />
[7] Tory Ford gets the crowd going with a rocking "You're a Mean One Mr. Grinch".  Why all the laughing?  Well, besides the fact that the holiday spirits were flowing heavy, Tory had some amazing backup dancers with her<br />
[8] Ken Blackwood closed out the holiday songs with a nice original holiday tune]]></description>

<title>October Tour 2007 pt. 1 - NYC</title>
<itunes:author>Nathan Moomaw</itunes:author>
<link>http://www.gazebomusic.com</link>
<description><![CDATA[This past October Miwa Gemini and I embarked on a nice little jaunt up north to Quebec and Ontario.  I did what I could to try to capture some of the great acts that we got to play with while on the road.  I also recorded Miwa, who (strangely enough) has never been featured on Gazebo Music yet.  What I came up with was really some bits from 3 of the shows that we played.  Unfortunately I can't capture everything at shows I attend due to factors such as crowd noise, battery life of my recording device, and my current intoxication level.  Regardless, I think I got some really great stuff from this tour.<br /><br />
This first installment of the series is from our show at Banjo Jim's in NYC.  It was a really great night.<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/miwagemini" target="_blank">Miwa Gemini</a> appears first on this podcast with her song 'Charlie Chaplin', followed by a fantastic cover of 'Que Sera Sera'.<br />
<a href="http://www.myspace.com/bigcream" target="_blank">Big Cream</a> also played with us at this show.  They had a great set and I captured their cover of Leonard Cohen's 'The Partisan', followed by 2 Big Cream originals.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The very first in a series of live music shows in San Francisco.  This is a selection of songs from the 3 lovely acts that graced the memorable night.  Starting off with the heartbreaking sounds of Lesser Lights we hear 2 beautiful folk country songs.  Picking up the pace, Pancho Sanza play what I believe was their first show and delight the night with inventive indie pop (3 songs).  The last 2 songs are chosen from The Aerosols' wonderfully jangly psych rock wrap up of the show.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<a href="http://myspace.com/adamsmithacousticproject" target="_blank">Adam Smith</a> is an old friend of mine.  He plays pretty country-folk music down in LA.  This is a great song of his I recorded earlier this summer while at a backyard show down in Santa Monica.  You can hear the birds chirping.  It's pretty groovy.]]></description>

<title>Winechuggers @ The Makeout Room 10-15-2006</title>
<itunes:author>Nathan Moomaw</itunes:author>
<link>http://www.gazebomusic.com</link>
<description><![CDATA[The Makeout Room (San Francisco), although it's a fantastic bar and a great venue, is also notoriously chatty for quiet bands such as <a href="http://www.myspace.com/winechuggers" target="_blank">Winechuggers</a> (<a href="http://arenarock.com/winechuggers/biography.htm" target="_blank">Arena Rock</a>).  This night was no exception, but 'The Wine' chugged right along and played a great set.<br />
<br />
I had alot of fun at the show and I tried to capture the night with these selections.  I like the song about horses.  The drummer, Charlie, did the best job of matching tie to cowboy shirt possible in this here universe.  And the fact that he was wearing it all starting at 8:30am brunch is phenomenal.<br />
<br />
So sit back with a pint or a glass of whiskey and enjoy this beautifully noisey recording of one of SF's finest country-tinged indie bands.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[This is a really rough practice session I did tonight in my living room.  The sound quality is pretty shot, but we can pretend that that's endearing.  Below are the songs I sing:<br />
1. Cedarhurst<br />
2. 3 Men<br />
3. Mary Jane Blues<br />
4. Dance Slow]]></description>

<title>Gazebo Music House Show #1</title>
<itunes:author>Nathan Moomaw</itunes:author>
<link>http://www.gazebomusic.com</link>
<description><![CDATA[The beginning of Gazebo Music in the form of a red wine soaked show at my house in San Francisco.  DUSTY DiMERCURIO and myself (NATHAN MOOMAW) start off the show and I kept all the songs that didn't clip out too bad (I'm still working on getting the recording process down).  Lots of great music from Dusty though (and lots of random Santana jokes...).  At around 32:30 I get a request to do some sort of psychadelic freestyle and I drunkenly do so.  Immediately after that Ed, UFO!, steps up and lays some music on the crowd from his laptop.  Crazy.  Then collaborated beats from Ed and DAVE DUBOIS and a couple of songs from Dave on the guitar and collaboration from the room.<br />
<br />
Check out the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/nathanmoomaw/sets/72157594312883084/show/" target="_blank">Flickr Photostream</a> of the show!]]></description>
