			<itunes:author>GameCrashers Radio</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[I was going to name this episode "The Times, They Are A'changin" but that sounds too negative.  Sure, there are some changes coming, but they're all good things, and one really crazy thing.  We can't say much, but here's a hint: cake...on...face...

- Rob argues "$10 Pass" is a bad solution and Gamestop is to blame

			<itunes:author>GameCrashers Radio</itunes:author>

The Rundown:
Game of the Week:  Rob:  Dead Space, Infinity Blade, Red Dead Redemption, Greed Corp
Stupid News: 
- Gamestop lists PSP2 for $999
- Geohotz (PS3 hacker) ordered to turn over computers, flash cards, hard drives, and PS3s
- Video Game Health Labeling Act: Round 2

			<title>GameCrashers Ep.68 - The 2nd Annual LIVE Crashstravaganza</title>
			<itunes:author>GameCrashers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Another year has come and gone, so it is time for us to break out the Special Reserve, don our headsets, and beat the #&@^ out of each other as we decide which games from 2010 deserve all the credit and which ones deserve all the scorn.

This show was streamed live in front of a Ustream audience (1/8/11)

The Rundown:
- The Rules
- The Best of the Best
- The Honorary Awards
- The Dubious Awards
- GAME OF THE YEAR!!
- The Unusual Awards
- 2011 predictions

Note: due to technical difficulties and my incredible knack at ripping the power strip out of the wall, one category from the list did not make the final recording (Best New Main Character).  On the plus side, I think we've just about had all the snafus we need for a full year...yep.

			<title>GameCrashers Ep.60 - LIVE from Monaco...and the End of the Universe!</title>
			<itunes:author>GameCrashers Radio</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[It's our first live show since E3.  Clearly, we still have an issue with brevity.  Joining us on this episode of the "cast" we have special guest Andy Schatz, the mind behind the indie title 'Monaco'.  We also talk stealth games and take your skype calls!

Amazingly, Skype only plummets into a black hole four or five times during the broadcast.  Which is a win for us!

The Rundown:
- Minecraft hype is infectious...and unexpected
- Hydrophobia is damn good fun
- Brickman calls out "The Sterling" and "Destructoid"
- Special Guest Andy Schatz answers our questions on Monaco (your questions, too)
- Our awesome listeners and fellow podcasters 'crash' our show
- We talk about our favorite (and less-than-favorite) 'Stealth Games'
- Live show OUT!

Musical Breaks:
Super Mario World, Mega Man, Front Mission, 007 Goldeneye, Mirror's Edge, MGS3 Snake Eater, Mega Man 2 (DnB Remix)

Special Music Info:
Monaco - Composer: Kevin MacLeod

Please subscribe on iTunes, follow us on Twitter, and check us out on Facebook.  Every little bit brings us closer to getting away with it (and getting out of Monaco alive).]]></description>

			<itunes:author>GameCrashers Radio</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Today our special guest Jon Barrickman helps us tackle the fall of print journalism, the death of used games, and how this industry thinks way too highly of itself (and takes itself way too seriously).

The Rundown:
Game of the Week:  Final Fantasy XIII, Yakuza 3, Fuel, The Humble Bundle
Valve has a sense of humor
A day at Metacritic
Stupid News:
Facebook to save PC Gaming? (Epic Games)
EA's bid to kill used games
Paying more for games
Discussion Topic: Print vs Web - Physical vs Online
Upcoming guests on GC

Update: so now Ubisoft is eyeing EA's pay model.  It starts!

			<itunes:author>GameCrashers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Warning: This episode contains references within that may prove to be too funny for some.  You may even find yourself laughing hysterically at how many lines we can cross in one episode.  Turn back now...you have been warned!!!

On this episode of GameCrashers we delve into places and topics that most video game podcasts have the good sense to steer clear of.  But we didn't learn those lessons in congeniality school...in fact we missed those classes altogether.  (stay in school, kids).

THE RUNDOWN:
- Game of the Week: MLB2K10, MGS4, Starcraft II Beta, Darksiders, Deadly Premonition
- Famitsu controversy
- $49 versus $59 for PC games
- Ephemeral?  Etherial? E Pluribus Unum!?
- Discussion Topic: Replay Value in video games
- Listener Responses
- Emails
- Lost: Via Domus (and why it exists)
- GameCrashers: A History
- Why MegaMan and I are not on speaking terms
- And some casual conversations we'd probably be better off forgetting (but decided to record for a podcast o.O)

We apologize for everything we've said, everything we're saying currently, and everything we'll most like say henceforth.  We appreciate your business.  Try the veal.]]></description>

			<itunes:author>GameCrashers Radio</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[As seen LIVE on Ustream, we recap the crazy events from day two of PAXEAST as well as celebrate our induction into the VGEVO podcast network.  Oh yeah, we get a bit drunk, too.  

The Rundown:
More and More games
More interviews,
More problems with big crowds and rampant crowding
More disappointments,
More surprises
More technical difficulties
And more PAX!!

We want to thank VGEVO for bringing us onboard and giving us the opportunity to be part of the Network of Podcasts.  But don't worry...we'd never sell out (pulls out a stack of hundreds and starts counting).

Stay tuned next week as we have our wrap-up show for PAX EAST.  We discuss the last full day of the show, we give our final assessment of the inaugural Beantown PAX, we talk about the Post-Pax Stupid News, and we'll be doing the whole thing LIVE!  That's right.  Our last PAX show will be live, Sunday night at 8pm EST.  We'll be trying, one more time, to take some calls from our awesome audience.  Don't miss it!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[GDC is over and the 'move' has been tested.  Well, not by us, but by those other 'journalists'.  What do we think of it?  Well, you'll have to listen to the show to find out.  Also, we talk about a collection of games containing Roman Numerals, we argue about the importance of unlockables, Boris attempts to rationalize "casual racism", and Jason, Brian, and I try to figure out why games are so damn hard to finish these days.

The Rundown:
Game of the Week:  Final Fantasy XIII, Batman AA (PC), Mega Man X
Gamepocalypse Ep.2 Preview - Jumper: Griffin's Story
Discussion Topic:  PS3 "Move" and OnLive

			<title>GameCrashers - Ep.36 - Valve&apos;s a Mac</title>
			<itunes:author>GameCrashers Radio</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Yes, we know about what happened at Infinity Ward.  Of course we haven't overlooked Brickfest2010.  But, seriously, Steam games on the Mac?  Portal 2!?  A new ending to Portal 1?!?!  These things cannot be ignored.

The Rundown:
- We read gamers responses to Jason's "Alan Wake" article
- The Stupid News:
   - Activision ousts Infinity Ward heads Zampella and West
   - Reaction to ApocalyPS3.
   - Valve tweaks end of Portal 1, announces Portal 2 and Mac Support
   - Emails and Comments
- Game of the week:
   - Heavy Rain, Battlefield Bad Company 2, Mega Man 9, Dante's Inferno, Stalker Shadow of Chernobyl, Bayonetta

Also, Final Fantasy XIII is out this week.  As such, the musical breaks for this episode include some of our favorite battle themes from the entirety of the series.

Next week: the "Slashrospective!" - a look back at the God of War series, the brawlers, beat'em'ups, hack'n'slashes, and more that created the genre, as well as GoW's place in it.

Bon Appetite! ]]></description>

			<title>GameCrashers - Ep.34 - Alan Wake hates on the PC</title>
			<itunes:author>GameCrashers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[So the PC is too intimate for you, eh Alan?  So you think you can't be all moody and depressed anywhere except a living room flat-screen TV?  Well, Jason doesn't buy your shenanigans, Microsoft!  Rob and Dave are forced to agree (it's in our contract).  

The Rundown:
Rob screws up the date...again
A very brief Game of the Week
We allude to the Gamepocalypse
Alan Wake axed on PC, excuse feels contrived
One Console Future: Listener Reactions
   - OnLive, Competition, New Consoles, Cloud Gaming, Boxed copies
Dave loses his train of thought...several times, in fact.

A short show for a short week.  Don't miss the first episode of the Gamepocalypse and the special "cross over" episode later this week!

Check out http://ocremix.org for more great video game remixes like the ones featured in this week's episode.

			<title>GameCrashers - Ep.27 - Best and Worst of &apos;Aught-Nine&apos;</title>
			<itunes:author>GameCrashers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[We made it to the end of the year!  Is someone recording this?  For our last show of 2009, Dave, Rob, and Jason trudge through the best and worst of the year to give you their 'awesome-est' damn podcast yet.  Stuff that in your stocking!  Happy Holidays!

The Rundown:
The Best and the Worst of 2009
Note:  Game of the Year was held at gunpoint, robbed, beat up, and left for dead in front of an ATM in Utah (who gets robbed in Utah?  They don't even DRINK THERE!).  Expect it to return on the Live show Jan. 3rd, 2010.  Preshow starts at 6:30pm EST, Live show starts @ 7:00 EST.

Don't miss it.  Missing our live show will cause an angel to have his wings chopped off, lose his job, find out his wife is cheating on him, cause him to start drinking again, and eventually result in his throwing himself off a bridge.  Do you really want to be saddled with that kind of responsibility?

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!]]></description>

			<itunes:summary>We made it to the end of the year!  Is someone recording this?  For our last show of 2009, Dave, Rob, and Jason trudge through the best and worst of the year to give you their &apos;awesome-est&apos; damn podcast yet.  Stuff that in your stocking!  Happy Holidays!

The Rundown:
The Best and the Worst of 2009
Note:  Game of the Year was held at gunpoint, robbed, beat up, and left for dead in front of an ATM in Utah (who gets robbed in Utah?  They don&apos;t even DRINK THERE!).  Expect it to return on the Live show Jan. 3rd, 2010.  Preshow starts at 6:30pm EST, Live show starts @ 7:00 EST.

Don&apos;t miss it.  Missing our live show will cause an angel to have his wings chopped off, lose his job, find out his wife is cheating on him, cause him to start drinking again, and eventually result in his throwing himself off a bridge.  Do you really want to be saddled with that kind of responsibility?

			<title>GameCrashers - Ep.26 - God of &apos;Dante&apos;s Inferno&apos;</title>
			<itunes:author>GameCrashers</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[So how much like GoW is it?  Dave gives us his first impressions of the demo.  Also I gush over the greatness that is Torchlight, Sean avoids talking about Grim Fandango, and Brian stays classy.  Just leave the tip on the counter before you leave.

The Rundown:
Game of the Week: Torchlight, Dante's Inferno Demo (Scythe versus Dual Swords), Grim Fandango, System Shock 2
Is Half Life Episode 3 ever coming out?
David informs the rest of us what a Thai Slush (yeah, I've never heard of it either)
The Stupid News:
- Healthcare providers offer virtual cash to derail healthcare bill
- Michael Atkinson responds to Aliens Vs Predator being denied classification
- David Jaffe thinks fighting the Australian Govt. on ratings is a losing battle
- Our response to 'Sheep Man' in Mega Man X

Yep, another short show.  But next week is our Best of/Worst of 2009 show.  It should be our grandest show yet (another way of saying a nightmare to edit!)  Send us an email at theblog@gamecrashers.net telling us what your best game and most disappointing game of 2009 were.  We'll read it on the next show.  Until then, Happy Holidays!]]></description>

The Rundown:
Responses from Ep.24
Question of the Week: Best/Worst video game holiday memories
Preview of Best of and End of the Year Show
Preview of Sean's new segment: Starting off on the Wrong Foot!

It's a short show this week, but it's filled with double the amount of sarcasm and wit to make up for it.  Hey, we love you guys (in a totally a-sexual kind of way).]]></description>

Topics we discuss on the show:

- Fallout 3, Battlefield 1943, Prototype, Super Mario Bros. 3, Sphinx and the Cursed Mummy, Quake Live, Unreal Tournament
- Double fine Countersues Activision
- Beyond Good & Evil 2 speculation creates more speculation.
- Town deadlocked on renewal of video game license for a Chuck E. Cheese
- ESA sues CTA for banning video game posters on Chicago buses
- Unreal Tournament 3 developer Epic Games says "don't expect a new UT any time soon"

It's all fun and games until someone rocket jumps your face.

			<title>GameCrashers - Ep.7</title>
			<itunes:author>GameCrashers.net</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[This week on GameCrashers radio, Soundtrack burns a hole in the space time continuum that is so deep it destroys our first attempt at recording Ep 7 and causes one of our guest hosts to disintegrate before our very eyes.  What's left is a collection of impatient, groggy, and battered podcasters who muster up whatever strength they have left to deliver up the mediocrity you're about to enjoy.  Hey, at least we aim high.

Topics we discuss and speculate on:

- Game of the Week: Fallout 3, Final Fantasy X-2, Ghostbusters, Ratchet & Clank Future, Paper Mario
- Do videogames need violence to tell compelling stories?
- Will Apple ban drug dealing game
- Midway bought by WB, RIP Midway
- Miracle on the Hudson flash game played 4.6 million times
- Eidos commits PR Sepiku regarding Batman: Arkham Asylum

And yes, I mispronounce Shenmue several times during this podcast.  Would you like a tissue?
