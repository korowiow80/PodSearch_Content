 <title>Talkie - listener voicemails, wistful reminiscing</title>
 <link>http://www.gapodcastnetwork.com/episodes/7756</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gapodcastnetwork.com/blogs/rusty-tanton/2009/07/27/georgia-podcast-network-long-term-plan&quot;&gt;deciding to shut down the Georgia Podcast Network sometime within the next year&lt;/a&gt;, we decided it was also time to call it a day with Mostly ITP as well. It&#039;s been a great run the past three years, and one episode isn&#039;t enough to say how much it&#039;s all meant to us. But that doesn&#039;t stop us from trying! Seriously, this is long as shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first play listener voicemails from Joseph, Jen and Grayson, and then the rest of the time is spent talking about running the site and the show, what we&#039;ve learned, how things have changed, fun stuff, etc. We said we&#039;d link to our appearance on the Cup O&#039; Joe radio show that led to us coming with the idea for this site, so &lt;a href=&quot;http://cupojoe.blogspot.com/2005_12_01_archive.html#113357473919242905&quot;&gt;here you go&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may update the notes later if I remember there being more stuff we said we&#039;d link to, look up, or explain. Or if you want to leave more voicemails at 678.389.9441.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks y&#039;all.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Chicken Episode!</title>
 <link>http://www.gapodcastnetwork.com/episodes/7622</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a huge episode with three separate interviews packed into a little over 40 minutes, all centered around chickens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part one features Barry Peavey, chairman of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildchickenfestival.com/&quot;&gt;Fitzgerald Wild Chicken Festival&lt;/a&gt;, and Winfred Tucker, who runs the Chicken House. We discuss the wild chickens which roam the streets of downtown Fitzgerald and the festival created to honor them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In part two, we interview Stephanie Van Parys, executive director of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://oakhurstgarden.org/&quot;&gt;Oakhurst Community Garden&lt;/a&gt; about the Garden&#039;s history and the chickens kept there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the final part we ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://atlantachickenwhisperer.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;the Chicken Whisperer Andy Schneider&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/chickens/&quot;&gt;the Atlanta Pet Chicken Meet-up&lt;/a&gt; and his recent &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ajc.com/news/content/metro/northfulton/stories/2009/04/11/chicken_giveaway.html&quot;&gt;Chicken Stimulus Package event&lt;/a&gt;, among other topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that comes up in all three interviews is the idea of keeping chickens in the back yard, which is something Amber and I have been interested in. Listen in for some different perspectives on why that may or may not be a good idea, and for a lot of other chicken-related information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&#039;re done listening to the podcast, be sure to also check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OXlKPvSkyA&quot;&gt;a short video I shot&lt;/a&gt; of some of the wild chickens in Fitzgerald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love voicemail! Leave us one by calling &lt;strong&gt;678.389.9441&lt;/strong&gt;. You can also follow me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rustytanton&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and Amber &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/amberlrhea&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Interview - Decatur bloggers Nick and Dave, proprietors of Decatur Metro and inDecatur</title>
 <link>http://www.gapodcastnetwork.com/episodes/6660</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;DeKalb County, particularly Decatur, has one of the more vibrant hyperlocal blogging scenes in Georgia. We discuss why this is the case and more in this interview with Dave Kell, proprietor of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ndecatur.com/&quot;&gt;inDecatur&lt;/a&gt; blog, and Nick, who runs &lt;a href=&quot;http://decaturmetro.com/&quot;&gt;Decatur Metro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The origins of their respective blogs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Atlanta Journal vs. Atlanta Constitution vibe between their two respective blogs, and the nature of their (friendly?) competition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://decaturmetro.com/2009/02/14/more-annoying-blog-reflection/#div-comment-8469&quot;&gt;tedious topic&lt;/a&gt; of what will happen when newspapers go belly up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advantages and disadvantages of partial anonymity versus full public disclosure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/carl&quot;&gt;Carl Black&lt;/a&gt; seems to be everywhere. (Now he&#039;s in our podcast too)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ve known Dave through other various functions in the past, but this was the first time we&#039;d met &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/amberlrhea/statuses/1196161987&quot;&gt;the elusive Nick&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first interview they&#039;ve given together. You heard it first on the Georgia Podcast Network!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(little joke there, you&#039;ll have to listen to get it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love voicemail! Leave us one by calling 678.389.9441. You can also follow me on Twitter &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/amberlrhea&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and Rusty &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/rustytanton&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Video - My Great Aunt Jane remembers the Winecoff Hotel Fire</title>
 <link>http://www.gapodcastnetwork.com/episodes/5159</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve been trying to make good on a goal I set more than a year ago to record more family history. My mom and I went to visit my Great Aunt Jane this past Saturday to shoot video of her telling stories about her life. We knew she had been a nurse, but we didn&#039;t know until Saturday she had been a night supervisor at Grady Hospital in Atlanta on December 7, 1946, the night of the Winecoff Hotel Fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Winecoff Hotel Fire was the worst in history at the time, and remains the worst in U.S. history, with 119 fatalities. In this video, she recalls her experience working in the morgue.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>LIVE Talkie - Election &#039;08, Waffle House Museum, sleep fetishes, social media, and more</title>
 <link>http://www.gapodcastnetwork.com/episodes/4686</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;[The title of this episode reveals my affinity for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma&quot;&gt;Oxford serial comma&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this live talkie, recorded Sunday, October 26, we cover many topics, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; More voicemails from Jen and Tony. Always entertaining - keep &#039;em coming! And that goes for the rest of you, too. Call in!
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony on hold with Sprint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tony calls in from the UGA game (part 1 and 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jen scolds Tony for drinking all the boxed wine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Rusty had wisdom tooth surgery recently and survived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/rustytanton/sets/72157608361919671/&quot;&gt;Waffle House Museum&lt;/a&gt; and want to go back and do a video tour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Who should we interview?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; We ramble a bit about the value of social media and what it means to be &quot;professional.&quot; (Shades of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beingamberrhea.com/2008/09/29/blogorlando-wrap-up-part-1/&quot;&gt;my BlogOrlando session&lt;/a&gt;.) Here&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beingamberrhea.com/2004/09/02/pontification/&quot;&gt;my post with the quote I was referencing&lt;/a&gt;; the original post I quoted is gone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; There&#039;s an election coming up. We endorse Obama, and Rusty describes an anti-Jim Martin mailer he received. It was put out by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.savejobs.org/&quot;&gt;Americans for Job Security&lt;/a&gt;. Images &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/rustytanton/2976183277/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://flickr.com/photos/rustytanton/2977038896/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; I had a photo shoot for my birthday and was Empowered&amp;trade; by it. Here&#039;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/groups/atlantaprisonfarm/pool/&quot;&gt;Flickr group&lt;/a&gt; for the location where it was done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Sleep fetishes: what&#039;s the deal?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love voicemail! Call us at &lt;strong&gt;678.389.9441&lt;/strong&gt;.
