			<title>Show #19.5 Session Report: The Lonely Mountain, the Lair of Smaug the Dragon</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://gameopolis.libsyn.com/show-19-5-session-report-the-lonely-mountain-the-lair-of-smaug-the-dragon]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this Session Report show, we "Point-5" one of the games we discussed during our Lord of the Rings Extravaganza of Show 19.0.</p>
<p>This Session Report is based on a friendly game of ICE's Lonely Mountain: The Lair of Smaug the Dragon, that we shared with our good friend Bill. This is a light discussion of some of the strategies each of the three of us employed, and also of some of the unforeseen events that threw a wrench into most of our strategies. While this play example was quite atypical for a couple reasons, we still got some fun insights into this game, and so we hope you enjoy hearing about some of the surprises that awaited us deep in Smaug's Lair.</p>
<p>We always love to hear from you, so please post a comment to this blog entry (at www.gameopolis.org or gameopolis.libsyn.com), or send us an email at info@gameopolis.org!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for Show 20.0, on its way to you very soon.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://gameopolis.libsyn.com/show-19-lord-of-the-rings-extravaganza]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>It is HERE! Our much-anticipated Lord of the Rings Extravaganza episode! Well...much-anticipated by US, anyway. As always, we start things off right on this "whole-number episode"...by opening up a Dusty Old Box, although in this case it is more accurately described as a Dusty Old THING.</p>
<p>After the Dusty Old Box segment, we launch into our LOTR Extravaganza, starting with a couple games from the early 1980s, then one from the mid-90s, and finishing off with a couple more recent releases. Our angle on this comparison is focused on how well we think each game embodies the LOTR theme. Our opinions range from one extreme to the other, so we hope you enjoy listening to what we think of them. We end this episode with a return of our segment "Mark's Personal Gaming Trivia", in which Mark describes an old gaming-group slang term that sounds so much more violent than it actually is.</p>
<p>We'd love to hear how&nbsp;your experiences compare with our opinions of these LOTR games, so please post a comment to this blog entry (at www.gameopolis.org or gameopolis.libsyn.com), or send us an email at info@gameopolis.org!</p>

Since this is a "whole-number episode", they start things off right...by opening up a Dusty Old Box! This Dusty Old Box takes us to places we haven't been before, and then brings us back again.</p>
<p>After the Dusty Old Box, Jeff talks a bit about Pizza Box Baseball, published by the On The Line Game Company. Jeff goes through the rules for all four complexity levels of the game, starting with the most basic ("A-league") and then building through Double-A, Triple-A, and finally "Pro-Ball" level. After Jeff's discussion of Pizza Box Baseball, Marks tells us about Days of Wonder's Cargo Noir. Mark describes the game rules, and then discusses some of the common arguments surrounding the theme of this game, and how the theme contributes to the play experience.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>In this session report, Mark and Jeff talk about a play session of Fantasy Flight Games' re-issue of DungeonQuest. They give an overview of the session's events, and focus a bit on some of the updates to this 3rd edition of the game: the combat system and the player character characteristics and abilities.

			<title>CarCast 01: Pirates vs Witches, RPGs vs Action Figures</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://gameopolis.libsyn.com/car-cast-01-pirates-vs-witches-rp-gs-vs-action-figures]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>This is the first of a spin-off series that we are calling the Gameopolis CarCast. The idea behind the CarCast is that whenever Mark and Jeff are commuting in the car together (talking about games and related topics, as always) we'll record the conversation --AND, if it sounds like a discussion we think our listeners would be interested in, we'll post it up here as a CarCast. Our CarCasts are completely independent of the regular Gameopolis podcasts, and are brought to you totally unplanned, and largely unedited (we only cut out the part where we argued about whether to go straight here and circle around the park, OR hang a left at this intersection and then turn right at the Gas Station). Also, there won't be any schedule for releasing the CarCasts, so you may detect some anachronisms in dates we refer to in the CarCasts relative to the shows' release dates.</p>
<p>We'll be back with the next regular installment of Gameopolis --Show 17.5-- very soon. Until then, we hope you enjoy the random musings of the Gameopolis CarCast!</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[This is the first of a spin-off series that we are calling the Gameopolis CarCast. The idea behind the CarCast is that whenever Mark and Jeff are commuting in the car together (talking about games and related topics, as always) we'll record the conversation --AND, if it sounds like a discussion we think our listeners would be interested in, we'll post it up here as a CarCast. Our CarCasts are completely independent of the regular Gameopolis podcasts, and are brought to you totally unplanned, and largely unedited (we only cut out the part where we argued about whether to go straight here and circle around the park, OR hang a left at this intersection and then turn right at the Gas Station). Also, there won't be any schedule for releasing the CarCasts, so you may detect some anachronisms in dates we refer to in the CarCasts relative to the shows' release dates.
We'll be back with the next regular installment of Gameopolis --Show 17.5-- very soon. Until then, we hope you enjoy the random musings of the Gameopolis CarCast!

<p>Our Halloween Episode! Since it's a whole number episode, we start off as always by opening up a Dusty Old Box. This Dusty Old Box turns out to be a blast from BOTH Mark's Past AND Jeff's Past. After the Dusty Old Box, Mark and Jeff dig into their main topics. Marks starts us off with a humorously scary&nbsp;Halloweeny treat: Kill Doctor Lucky (and His Little Dog Too): a lighthearted game of murderous intent. Afterwards, Jeff provides some Halloween-free fun with his coverage of Commands and Colors Ancients --which he miraculously does WITHOUT making a single "Borg assimilation" joke!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>It's finally here! Our long awaited Podcast of Hate! In this show, Mark and Jeff field listener comments about the things they hate, dislike, or otherwise do not savor in the gaming world. Before we dive into the cauldron of embitterment, our Dusty Old Box segment features an unusual --a VERY unusual game that is "kinda-sorta" like some other games but is really unique in many ways. In actuality, today's Dusty Old Box is not a box, but...a Dusty Old Thing.</p>
<p>Once Mark and Jeff dive into the hate, they cover discussion topics ranging from poor sportsmanship to game company publishing practices, to game group dynamics.</p>
<p>Before signing off, Jeff does a quick segment to describe the game Cube Fame, published by Cheapass Games. This is a very high-level description of the game, and gives us something to "Point-Five" next time, and so we'll dig into Cube Farm a bit more deeply the next time&nbsp;we plug-in our headset mics!</p>
<p>Lastly, Mark surprises everyone --including Jeff-- by spontaneously introducing a new show segment: Mark's Personal Game Trivia, which is certain to inspire many a wrinkled brow.</p>
<p>If you have any comments that you would like to share, please feel free to write in via email or blog entry. We'd love to hear from you!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>At long last, Mark and Jeff shake-off those summertime blues to don the ole headset mics, for a double-header session report. We start off with Rio Grande's Race for the Galaxy. We have some high level discussion of which civilizations -and&nbsp;which overall strategies- we played, and our overall impressions of the game. From there, we move onto a session report of Kosmos' and Rio Grande's Dracula. Once again, we stick to the overall flow and feel of the game. Additionally, we discuss a couple aspects of game play that surprised us upon our first play.</p>
<p>Lastly, we send out one last reminder for our listeners to send-in discussion topics for the upcoming Podcast of Hate (companion podcast to last year's Podcast of Love). You can post your thoughts to this show's comments or email to info@gameopolis.org.</p>

			<title>Show #14: Dracula-For-Two, and Race For the Galaxy</title>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our Dusty Old Box segment features a blast from the past --Mark catapults Jeff back to junior high school days with this one. Mark then polishes-off the Dusty segment --not with a box, but with a...thing...a...Dusty Old Thing.</p>
<p>Once Jeff recovers from his temporal shift, we dig into our main topics. Unlike our typical main segments, in which one of us presents a game we know well and love, we thought it would be a fun change of pace to present two games that were totally brand-new to BOTH of us. Jeff starts us off by covering the game Dracula, a two-player game that is part of the Kosmos "Games For Two" series. Afterwards, Mark covers his most recently-acquired card game: Rio Grande's Race For the Galaxy.</p>
<p>Before signing off, Jeff brings up a "did ya ever notice?" observation about games involving a lot of dice rolling, and after some brief banter, Mark and Jeff ask for some assistance and/or guidance for YOU, our beloved Podcast Nation. You can post your contributions to this show's comments on the blog page, or you can email them to info@gameopolis.org.</p>
<p>As a reminder, we still need your comments and contributions to make the Podcast of Hate become a reality! As always, you can post your contributions to this show's comments on the blog page, or you can email them to info@gameopolis.org.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Our Dusty Old Box segment features a real treat that Jeff has been holding-off for a special occasion. Since this is our 25th episode --our "Silver Anniversary Episode"-- Jeff decided now was the time to break it out! After the Dusty Old Box, Mark and Jeff dig into a full docket crammed with gaming goodness. Jeff starts us off by covering not one game, but a gaming genre: Historical naval miniatures in the American Civil War era. Jeff's M.O. is a side-by-side comparison of three of his favorite rules sets: one very simple set, one quite complex, and a third rules set somewhere in between. Jeff compares and contrasts the game mechanics used in each of these three rules sets. After Jeff brings us back from the 19th century, Mark covers one of his family's new favorite card games: Gloom.</p>
<p>Before signing off, we listen-in on&nbsp;our interview with Niko White: the designer of the newest expansion card set for the Battleground Fantasy Warfare game, The Dark Elves. Niko tells us about some of his design rationale and his motivations behind this cool and edgy new expansion for one of our favorite games. Thanks again, Niko!</p>
<p>We put in another quick call for discussion topics for the Podcast of Hate (companion podcast to last year's Podcast of Love). Come on!!!

            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: x-small;">&nbsp;</span>Happy New Year from your friends at Gameopolis!</p>
<p>We start off this episode with our Dusty Old Box segment, which features a game in a 5-sided box. Inside the strange box is a very old game from a very old game company. After the Dusty Old Box, Mark and Jeff get down to business with an efficient, back-to-basics show. Mark starts us off with coverage of Samurai Swords (originally known as Shogun), which was part of Milton Bradley's GameMaster series. Then, Jeff describes Your Move Games' Battleground Fantasy Warfare. We'll put some pics up on the <a title="gameopolis flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39904564@N05/" target="_blank">Gameopolis Flickr Page</a>!</p>
<p>Lastly, Mark and Jeff roll out our first call for discussion topics for the Podcast of Hate (companion podcast to last year's Podcast of Love). Come on!!! We all have pet peaves and things that otherwise get under our skin. Here's your chance to get up on your soapbox and put us all back onto the straight-and-narrow!!!

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[&nbsp;Happy New Year from your friends at Gameopolis!
We start off this episode with our Dusty Old Box segment, which features a game in a 5-sided box. Inside the strange box is a very old game from a very old game company. After the Dusty Old Box, Mark and Jeff get down to business with an efficient, back-to-basics show. Mark starts us off with coverage of Samurai Swords (originally known as Shogun), which was part of Milton Bradley's GameMaster series. Then, Jeff describes Your Move Games' Battleground Fantasy Warfare. We'll put some pics up on the Gameopolis Flickr Page!
Lastly, Mark and Jeff roll out our first call for discussion topics for the Podcast of Hate (companion podcast to last year's Podcast of Love). Come on!!! We all have pet peaves and things that otherwise get under our skin. Here's your chance to get up on your soapbox and put us all back onto the straight-and-narrow!!! You can post your thoughts to this show's comments, or email them to us&nbsp;at info@gameopolis.org.
Even if you don't have any feedback for the Podcast of Hate, we'd still LOVE to hear from you --our beloved podcast nation-- so please post a comment to this blog entry, or send an email to info@gameopolis.org!

We'll be doing a couple more sessions of this one when the opportunity presents itself...and YOU --our Podcast Nation-- will benefit from our future play experiences in the form of brief field reports.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Mark and Jeff cover almost every aspect of the life of a boardgame in this show, we discuss a dusty old game box...then a game store...then a game...and lastly, a game convention!!!</p>
<p>Our Dusty Old Box segment focuses on something we believe few --if any-- of our listeners have encountered --a rare, Trademark game of space warfare potentially worth over $65,000! Or not. From here, we move on to our latest installment of our new segment, As Far As Possible Game Goes Kaupankaynti. Mark tells us about his game store-hunting in Washington DC, and then we strap into the Way-Back machine to revisit Jeff's recent trek to Game Empire in San Diego, CA. After hearing about Game Empire, we dig into our main segment for today's show: the game Those Pesky Humans, by Minion Games. This is primarily a 2-player game of human marauders perpetrating horrible injustices against the innocent monster home-owner who is just minding his own business. Lastly, we go into a brief recount of Jeff's experiences at the Carnage 2010 gaming convention. Lots of pics on the <a title="Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39904564@N05/" target="_blank">Gameopolis Flickr Page</a>! We LOVE to hear from our listeners, so please post a comment to this blog entry, or send an email to info@gameopolis.org!</p>

<p>Arrrgggghh!!!! Those two wharf rats that go by the names-o-Mark and Jeff be runnin out thar cannons ta take on thar olde rival -ye Black Privateer! It's time for our second annual International Talk Like a Pirate Gameopolis Podcast. Mark and Jeff sail from port to port in search of a number of eclectic gaming related topics. After starting with the Dusty Old Box --a dusty olde treasure chest to be more exact-- we address some Listener Feedback and then launch into our first main topic --our Pirate themed Talk-Like-A-Pirate game: Cheapass Games' Captain Treasure Boots. Jeff gives us a brief over view of Capt Treasure Boots and describes his tricked-out copy featuring little teeny tiny pirate ships purchased from an online jewelry supply store. We'll post pictures of these teeny tiny square-riggers on the <a title="Gameopolis Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39904564@N05/" target="_blank">Gameopolis Flickr Page</a>. Next, Mark and Jeff set sail in search of games ported from the tabletop to the portable electronic device. We span old and new games that have "crossed over to the other side". Lastly, we flip this topic on its head and discuss games --one in particular-- that has made this trek in the opposite direction: Skirmish Wars Advance Tactics. Jeff talks about his version of SWAT that he will be taking up to the Carnage 2010 Gaming Convention. And so this episode ends with a teaser for Carnage 2010.</p>

<p>Mark and Jeff take the Session Report format back to its roots in show 9.5. This Session Report is true to our original vision: an overview of the <em>feel of the game</em>, our general impressions, the main thoughts and choices we had in a typical game turn. We talk about what we liked and didn't like about it. At 18 minutes 10 seconds, this show is just long enough to listen to while enjoying a couple slices of pizza! Check out some pics of Pizza Box Football on our <a title="Gameopolis Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39904564@N05/" target="_blank">Gameopolis Flickr Page</a>.</p>

Mark and Jeff take the Session Report format back to its roots in show 9.5. This Session Report is true to our original vision: an overview of the feel of the game, our general impressions, the main thoughts and choices we had in a typical game turn. We talk about what we liked and didn't like about it. At 18 minutes 10 seconds, this show is just long enough to listen to while enjoying a couple slices of pizza! Check out some pics of Pizza Box Football on our Gameopolis Flickr Page.

<p>It's a really big show....really...BIG. It's also our First Anniversary Show. And Mark and Jeff cover a lot of ground here -from introducing a new recurring segment --to closing-out the First Gameopolis Challenge --to addressing errata from previous shows --to 2 really fun games (one old and meaty; one new and light).</p>
<p>We start you off by opening up a Dusty Old Box...a Dusty, Deteriorating, Deciduous Box with an awesome game inside.</p>
<p>Then, we announce the five winners of our First Gameopolis Challenge. If you are one of the winners, be sure to email us at info@gameopolis.org to give us your physical address so we can send you your fantastic Gameopolis Coffee Mug!</p>
<p>In the show's main segment, Mark covers the Avalon Hill game History of the World. Mark covers the nuts and bolts of the game as well as some basic strategic considerations.</p>
<p>After Mark's coverage of HOTW, Jeff talks about a relatively new release from the On The Line Game Company: Pizza Box Football. Jeff tries to give you a basic feel for the game, its mechanics and some of the main gameplay options.</p>

<p>In the show's main segment, it's the Podcast of Love. We talk about what some of you --our beloved listeners, our Podcast Nation-- truly LOVE about the hobby of gaming. We read out several blog postings and emails that we've received on this topic, and comment on each of them.</p>
<p>In a second segment (actually a mini-segment), Mark talks about a brand-new release from Gamewright: Forbidden Island, which we'll talk about again in the upcoming session report, Show 8.5.</p>
<p>Lastly, we put out another invitation to you all to participate in our Gameopolis Coffee Mug Challenge, which we first rolled-out in Show 7.5. We play samples of eight (not nine) different sounds from the beeping, buzzing, whirring 1980s boardgame Dark Tower.

<p>Your voice has been heard; your vote counted!!!!</p>
<p>All hail Gameopolis as a paragon of Democracy!!!!</p>
<p>Okay, so we're probably overstating this a bit, but rest-assured your voice WAS HEARD. Our Surveymonkey survey on monaural vs stereo sound was tallied, and due to overwhelming vote, we are switching back to monaural sound (both of your ears will hear the exact same thing). For now, here is a re-release of show 6.5 re-mixed for monaural sound. If you already downloaded 6.5 and are okay with it in its original format, then you need not download this file. But if you downloaded 6.5 and were disappointed by the stereo effect, then this file will fix the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your feedback. We'll be talking to you again very soon!</p>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This evening, I (Jeff) had the joy that all parent/gamers look forward to: I played my first entire, complete, start-to-finish game with my older (4-year-old) son.&nbsp; This event was remarkable --and holds Gamer interest that goes beyond the mere "doting dad story"-- for a few reasons, detailed below.</p>
<p>Now, in full disclosure, this was not the first time I had played a game with my older boy.&nbsp; We have many partial games of Chutes and Ladders and Candyland under our collective belts.&nbsp; Tonight was different.&nbsp; My FIRST surprise of the evening was that tonight, the game was my son's idea!&nbsp; In the past, it was always I that was trying to encourage my son into a game-of-something.&nbsp; In contrast, my son told ME that he want to play a game! So we went into the family play room and started scanning the shelves of assorted toddler games, but as I ran my pointing hand past the Candyland, the Chutes and Ladders, and the Hi Ho Cherry-O, my son said, "No! Daddy Games!" --and this was my SECOND surprise of the night-- My son pushed my pointing hand up to the highest shelf that is home to all of my boardgames from when I was a kid: my original Battleship set, my original Monopoly and Clue games are on this shelf.&nbsp; Tonight it was NOT going to be Candyland or Chutes and Ladders; it was going to be Dungeon Dice.&nbsp; While this game is not a deep well of strategy, it is not a toddler game by any means.&nbsp; The box reads "Ages 8 and up".&nbsp; "Okay", I said, "we can play Dungeon Dice."&nbsp; My son followed me proudly as we carried the game to the dining room to set it up, all the while saying "Boardgame Night! Boardgame Night!"&nbsp; (As an aside, one night&nbsp; a month, I host my gaming group for boardgame night --which I hold in the dining room-- so my son was apparently very excited about having his own Boardgame Night with daddy.)</p>
<p>Now before I tell you about my third and final surprise of the evening, a quick word about Dungeon Dice as a game.&nbsp; This is basically a dice rolling game as you'd guess from the title.&nbsp; Each player represents a prisoner in a dungeon trying to dig their way to freedom.&nbsp; You extend your escape tunnel by rolling matching sets of symbols on the game dice --which are 6-sided dice whose 6 sides depict symbols of five different types of escape tools (shovels, lanterns, daggers, etc) or the Guard!&nbsp; The Guard is bad; more on the Guard later.&nbsp; You collect tunnel cards by rolling 3-of-a-kind or higher: 1 tunnel card for 3-of-a-kind; 2 tunnel cards for 4-of-a-kind; 3 tunnel cards for 5-of-a-kind, etc.&nbsp; Build a tunnel of 8 tunnel cards and you win.&nbsp; Very simple.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few additional rules that force a bit a light strategy into the dice rolling, but you get the picture.&nbsp; This is basically Yatzee-Lite-with-fantasy-chrome.</p>
<p>Now, this sets the stage for my THIRD revelation of the evening: this kid can SERIOUSLY roll dice!!!&nbsp; The first game (we played twice, and my son won both games) my son took his first turn rolling the six dice and right-off-the-bat rolled four daggers!&nbsp; As per the game rules, those four dagger dice are set aside and he gets the option to re-roll the remaining dice to try to better his score.&nbsp; He took the remaining two dice and rerolled them producing a fifth dagger!&nbsp; One turn; three cards!&nbsp; This kept up, and I think in four or five turns, he won the game.&nbsp; The top picture shows the game board at the end of play.</p>
<p>My son then told me he wanted to play again! Maybe he really enjoyed it, or maybe he thought he was forestalling bedtime.&nbsp; Anyway, the second game was much closer.&nbsp; In fact, on two consecute turns, my son rolled 3 Guards and ended his turn without collecting any tunnel cards, which allowed me to take the lead. Then, my son took the dice and rolled...yep, you guessed it... Five-of-a-kind, and won the game (bottom picture).</p>
<p>So, as I reflect on this evening,&nbsp;I am very glad that my son has finally taken to gaming (before bedtime, he asked for assurance that we can play again tomorrow, which as many of you can appreciate, will be one of the things that I will dream of tonight).&nbsp; I am also glad that my son apparently does not share his dad's misfortune with the dice (I have got to have the worst dice rolling abilities of anyone I know, and I am glad that my son is not stricken by the same affliction).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I need to check the regs of any tournaments that I consider entering to see if they make provisions for "Designated Rollers".&nbsp; If it is at all possible, I want my son to do my dice rolling for me!</p>]]></description>

<p>Mark and Jeff get back to the topic of the&nbsp;Dusty Old Box...this time with Jeff's super-double-secret extra-special dusty old box --which for a change is actually dusty! Afterward, Mark tells us about Rio Grande's Stone Age, a light and colorful game of community-building set in the dawn of human civilization. Next, Jeff's talks about Home-Brewed Boardgame Expansions: home rules sets complete with additional game components added. The point is to add some functionality to an already-great game.&nbsp; To illustrate, Jeff talks about his home brewed expansions to Steve Jackson Games' Car Wars Card Game, and Avalon Hill's Monsters Menace America.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We are calling out to all our listeners because we'd like&nbsp;your feedback.&nbsp; In Show 6.5, we experimented with Stereo sound --Mark's in your left ear, while Jeff is in your right ear.</p>
<p>We are interested in knowing how all of you like the change from mono to stereo.&nbsp; We realize that while stereo sound is nice and can give you that realistic,&nbsp;"actually-in-Gameopolis" feeling, it is not always practical.&nbsp; Maybe you normally listen to podcasts with a single earpiece and are only hearing one side of the conversation...maybe you listen in busy, noisy places and like having the steady, unchanging sound of a mono recording.&nbsp; Or, maybe you are embracing the change to stereo, and are anxiously awaiting the day when we will switch to surround 5.1 and will offer 3D holographic video so Mark and Jeff will appear right there in your own living room!!!</p>
<p>Please take a moment (trust us --it really is one moment...it is&nbsp;only one question) to&nbsp;visit our survey and let us know what you prefer for future Gameopolis episodes.&nbsp;</p>

</span></span></p>
<p>Mark and Jeff talk about a totally indispensable part of any game collection: the humble "Filler Game". Filler games --which Mark and Jeff loosely define as games that can be played in less than an hour-- are great for keeping us entertained and/or occupied when we are waiting for the day's main event to start or for when the main event ends a little too soon for everyone's taste. Mark and Jeff cover four filler games in this episode. We will return to this topic in the future, so we are calling this 'Fillers part 1'.</p>
<p>Before our discussion of filler games, we&nbsp;ask for&nbsp;Listener ideas for our Podcast of Love, making its premier soon!</p>

<p>We start this show off with a rather atypical opening of a dusty old box. Mark has several different approaches that keep everyone --including himself-- on their toes. We prove that Gameopolis is a better buy than a trip to the movies, and we even supply a picture of an explosion in the show notes so Gameopolis is every bit as exciting! We may add more explosions to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/39904564@N05/" target="_blank">Gameopolis Flickr account</a> for added excitement.</p>
<p>After that, Mark covers Days of Wonder's Mystery of the Abbey, a cloistered Who-Done-It.&nbsp; He covers all of the main game mechanics and strategies.</p>
<p>Then, we shift over to Jeff for his segment on Mayfair Games' Domaine --a game of Land, Wealth, Power, and Prestige. Jeff gives the basics of play, and some starter strategy and insights.</p>

			<title>Extreme Parcheesi</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://gameopolis.libsyn.com/extreme-parcheesi]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<font size="1"><span lang="EN"><p>I started thinking about this project when my 3 1/2 year old son (not quite ready for structured boardgames) insisted on a family game of Parcheesi. Now just a little background info...my son is extremely high energy --even for a 3 year-old. He also has a long standing fascination with dice, and so to preserve dad's dice collection I have gotten my son his own dice pouch with his own collection of polyhedrals (big ones, so not a choking hazard).</p>
<p>With my son's current attention span, any game that we attempt lasts for maybe 2 or 3 turns, after which it quickly degenerates into bouts of: a) dice being thrown to intentionally knock over pawns; b) pawns being picked up stuffed into my son's pants pockets; or c) my son grabbing and rolling any polyhedral dice that strike his fancy rather than the dice that come with the game. It was in this degenerative phase of our family Parcheesi game that it occurred to me that this entropy could be harnessed for cause of Good. And so I started considering how one might mod Parcheesi into what (for the moment) I am calling &quot;Extreme Parcheesi&quot;. Here is what I have so far.</p>
<p>1. Dice: Each turn one player is designated the &quot;leader&quot;, and the role of leader rotates clockwise each turn. <em>(Use a special unique token, marker, banner, funny hat, or viking hemlet to designate who is the current leader.)</em> At the start of each turn, the leader decides what type of dice will be rolled that turn for movement (any two dice as a combination of d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20 --no &quot;tens&quot; d10s marked &quot;10&quot;, &quot;20&quot;, etc are allowed). All standard Parcheesi die rolling conventions apply. So if you have entered all of your pawns and you want to minimize your opponents' chances of entering their pawns, declare 2d20 when you are leader and your opponents have much lower odds of rolling a 5.</p>
<p>2. Blocking spaces: This standard Parcheesi rule --that you can block a space by positioning two of your own pawns on it-- is removed and replaced with Combat rules (below)</p>
<p>3. Stacking limits: There is now no limit to the number of your pawns that may occupy a space, and no limit to the number of different players that may occupy a space.</p>
<p>4. Combat: Whenever you land a pawn on a space containing one or more opponent pawns, combat is initiated. Every player with one or more pawns on the contested space rolls one d20 for every pawn they have on the space. The attacker --the player that most recently entered the space-- gets one bonus d20 to roll. The player who has the high roll (that is, the single d20 showing the highest result) gets to send one opponent pawn of the winner's choice back to its starting space. If combat is between only two players and the high roll is tied, the defender automatically wins. If &gt;2 players occupy the space and the high roll is a tie, then there is a roll-off to determine the winner. NOTES: Combat ALWAYS uses d20s regardless of what die combination the leader has declared for the current turn. Combat lasts only one round, not until all opponent pawns are eliminated. If pawns of &gt;1 player occupy the same space at the beginning of any player's turn, no combat ensues unless a new pawn enters the shared space.</p>
<p>5. Species enemy (optional). Each player has a &quot;natural enemy&quot;, and he/she will always get an extra bonus die (d20) to roll in combat when that natural enemy occupies the contested space. This option is more intuitive when you are playing the <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/51681" target="_blank">2001&nbsp;Milton Bradley &nbsp;release</a> that uses animal miniatures as pawns. If you are playing with a traditional Parcheesi set, then refer to the colors in parentheses.</p>
<p>Tiger (red) gets a bonus against Water Buffalo (green)<br/>Water Buffalo (green) gets a bonus against Camel (yellow)<br/>Camel (yellow) gets a bonus against Elephant (blue)<br/>Elephant (blue) gets a bonus against Tiger (red)</p>
<p>If you are using a set with colors different than the ones I list here, just come up with a combination that all players can agree on.</p>
<p>Try it out and let me know what you think!</p>

After that, in Mark's segment, Mark covers the original (1985) release of Warrior Knights, a medieval combat/political.&nbsp; He covers all of the main game mechanics and strategies.
Then we zip forward in time to the distant ( or not-so-distant) future, for Jeff's segment on Legions of Steel, an out-of-print Sci-Fi tactical combat game.&nbsp; We've put up a few pictures on the Gameopolis Flickr Page, so check them out!

Thanks again to everyone who has taken the time to write in or post comments.&nbsp; We hope you enjoy this show.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Gameopolis -The Gaming Podcast with Mark and Jeff!&nbsp; This project is in its infancy.&nbsp; Mark and I are putting together our show notes, our intro and outtro audio, and figuring out some final details.&nbsp; As soon as we get our first show together, we'll have it up here, and we will&nbsp;get the word out among the gaming podcast community.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For now, if you have found this site, please check back often.</p>
<p>If you are interested in what this podcast will be about, we are planning a podcast focusing on boardgames, strategy games, role-playing games, and maybe some card-based games as well.&nbsp; We will likely touch occasionally on some computer games, but this will not be the focus of this podcast, and since Mark and I tend to lean toward&nbsp;fantasy and strategy&nbsp;computer games, the occasional computer game topic will likely be&nbsp;within these genera.</p>
<p>Mark and I are both family guys, and we strongly support gaming as a family activity.&nbsp; Therefore, we'll&nbsp;make sure&nbsp;our&nbsp;MP3 files are suitable for a general audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am NOT implying that&nbsp;we are planning&nbsp;any shows on the topic of &quot;Candyland&quot; or&nbsp;&quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot;, just that&nbsp;Mark and I want this podcast to be one that you could listen to with children present if&nbsp;you wanted to.</p>
<p>In Show #1, Mark and I will visit a topic that is commonly discussed in gaming podcasts: the formative games in both of our gaming-lives.&nbsp; Stay tuned, Gameopolis is coming!!!</p>
