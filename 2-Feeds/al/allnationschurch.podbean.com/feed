			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re really happy to present our ‘Build Me Up’ section. From time to time we will update this section with a 5 minute track (approx) from what we believe to be the core of a key message. These may be a highlight or a compilation of a message that has previously been released as a podcast episode but presented here in a shorter format. The hope is that these short tracks will encourage and build you up as you listen to them in your car, on your PC or on your MP3 player - be stirred in your most holy faith!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our main theme of teaching for 2010 is ‘Life in the Spirit’.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit has been impressing upon us, in recent days and weeks, that when we gather together &#8216;Everyone Has&#8230;&#8217; (1 Corinthians 14:26).</p>
<p>On this particular Sunday we gathered unto the Lord to glorify Him, to hear testimonies of what He has been doing in the lives of the people and to give Him thanks and praise. This weeks podcast is a compilation of the gathering. There is an exhortation from Jonathan Cooper, prophetic Word, the Song of the Lord and the cry of the people to save this wonderful City - &#8220;Cardiff for Christ!&#8221;</p>
<p>Join us each week as we learn what it is to live day by day in the fellowship, anointing, fruit and power of the Holy Spirit. Life in the Spirit is for everyone, for every Christian for as Romans 8:14 tells us: “…those whose way of life is the Spirit are the sons of God.”</p>

These may be a highlight or a compilation of a message that has previously been released as a podcast episode but presented here in a shorter format. The hope is that these short tracks will encourage and build you up as you listen to them in your car, on your PC or on your MP3 player - be stirred in your most holy faith! </span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We’re really happy to present our ‘Build Me Up’ section. From time to time we will update this section with a 5 minute track (approx) from what we believe to be the core of a key message. These may be a highlight or a compilation of a message that has previously been released as a podcast episode but presented here in a shorter format. The hope is that these short tracks will encourage and build you up as you listen to them in your car, on your PC or on your MP3 player - be stirred in your most holy faith!</p>
<p> (Music ‘I Now Will Come&#8217;’ from the album &#8216;Maranatha’ by Ben Woodward)
