<description>Many people ask, "How am I to make the surrender of myself to God?" You desire to give yourself to Him but you are weak in moral power, you're imoral, you're in slavery. The Lord says if you doubt God you're damned, and you will be damned. To Satan you're controlled by the habits of your life, the sin, by the power of Satan that is living in you.</description>

<description>The Bible states He owns us. Jesus owns us, because He bought us with His own blood. He saved our souls. He forgave our sins with His blood, so then He purchased us with His blood and in injuring him you sin against God because Christ owns them and lay off! Christ owns them who is also your creator and their creator and your redeemer and their redeemer.</description>

<description>As you see the enormity of your sin as you see yourself as you really are. You're praying, God reveal myself, give me a clean heart, do not give up to despair when the Lord shows you that you're a sinner. What you're supposed to do is repent and forsake, now people say we repent, we repent, but they never forsake the sin. That's part of the same sentence folks because no sinner shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven.</description>

<description>Pride feels no need to repent. So it chooses to close the door on their salvation. They close the door of their heart and who do they close it against? They close it against Christ and the infinite blessing that he came into this world to give them.</description>

<description>When the Lord came into the earth as a man, God came to earth as man, it says so in chapter 1 of John. Now Reverend Hagee says He had different flesh than we do, different blood.

And He began showing me that there's something more in this world than just living a care free life. Living the way we want to. You can enjoy yourself all throughout your life but then all of a sudden God pulls you into reality next to himself and unfortunately some people that doesn't happen to until they die.</description>

You people full of pride which is the same spirit of blasphemy.</description>

Why would you not be thankful for the blessing and the glory and the wisdom that God has given you that He has and if you're in Him you're the fullness of the Lord and that He's thankful. He's thankful for every soul that enters into the Kingdom of Heaven and believes Him.</description>

The Lord is sending thunder now on this earth to wake the people up. Why, because the Lord doesn't want anyone to go to hell and the lake of fire and that's where they are going if they don't receive the things that are being preached here today and the things I preach every day.</description>

And you wonder how, you say, come on everything couldn't be of the Vatican, even though the Lord says so; she's the cause, the mother of every abominable thing that's going on the earth. Everything is set up for them to take over the world, this dictatorship which they call democracy.</description>

They hate the deeds of these people that are attempting to make it look like Jesus never really rose from the grave. They say that Christ hasn't risen and that is such false doctrine to cause peoples souls to not believe the Bible.</description>

If you do that and don't favor them but you favor Him, then your daughters and your sons, your fathers and your mothers will be saved because they see the strong stand that you make for the Lord.

<description>There's people in churches you go in and they say did you know that Tony Alamo is a cult. They picked that up from the Vatican from the Roman Catholic Church. The third letter that John wrote to the church is a personal note to a Pastor about other Pastors who refuse to accept other Pastors into their church but prefer to gossip about them.</description>

<description>The Bible says that were not to know anybody but the Lord if we want to go to the Kingdom of Heaven and stay out of hell. He says in His word love not the world, because everything in the world is lust. The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh and the pride of life, everything.</description>

<description>The fear of the Lord and understanding and that you can't lie you dirty filthy scum. Well how can a Pastor call people dirty filthy scum. The Lord calls you if you've left the Lord a vomit eating dog. You think that wallowing in sin is going to be acceptable of the lord. At no risk of loosing you, you can leave the church and the church will be blessed more by having no sign of any scum bucket in the church. You sure don't preach like other preachers. Right.</description>

<description>If you have the faith to witness to people then you're going to have praise honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ when he comes back to earth. Because the trying of your faith is much more, much more, abundantly more, precious than gold that perishes even though it's tried with fire. That's how gold gets strong is because it's put through the fire and it takes all the dross out of it and it becomes pure. If you keep the faith you're going to go through some fire.</description>

And given you the power of God within you to be able to keep the commandments from now on and you still keep sinning.

<description>But now He hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the earth only but also heaven. So I am not only going to shake the earth again I am going to shake the earth and heaven. I'm going to find out who could be shaken away and the ones that will stick and stay and make it pay. Verse 27 and this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken like people that fall away. There is a great falling away they've been shaken away from salvation. They were saved but they're not always saved if they can be shaken away by temptation, by some kind of lust out in the world or lust in their flesh.  Because they never allowed the Lord to take their flesh over, they never surrendered completely to Him.</description>

<description>We should never be discouraged. We should just take it to the Lord in prayer. If we have trials and temptations, take it to the Lord in prayer. The Lord didn't say worry always or worry without ceasing. It doesn't do any good to worry. But it does a mountain of good if you pray to the Lord about your situation.</description>

We hear so many people say bless you, bless you, their blessings don't mean anything if they're not saved. It's just a phrase that they coined to make people believe that they're Christians.</description>

<description>You can not send my spirit in to Hell. You're not going to pressure me like you're trying to do with Buster White. Pressuring him saying if you don't go to Tony's church anymore this will go away all this persecution that we re doing to you. Because they don't want anyone to come to my church. But they do anyway, that's defiance to the devil. Yes we are defiant to the devil and you comply with Satan therefore you haven't got a chance to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.</description>

<description>verse 6, But this I say, he that soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly. You people out in the world that are hanging onto your money because you don't trust God enough to know that if there is a gas crisis or whatever else is going on that your going to prosper by saving your money and as your saving it, it's dwindling down anyway. The best thing to do is seek the Lord to see if He wants you to tithe some of it, if He does do it. Because He'll send back 100 fold.</description>

<description>They knew the Jews were the first Church. The true Church of God started on the day of Pentacost. They were all broke they didn't have any money. But when Peter a Jew, he was the only apostle that had a wife that we know of and Pope's don't have wives they're homosexuals and Peter was no homosexual. Priests most of them are homosexuals and child molesters. That is the most satanic cult on the face of this earth and the Lord said in his Word that they are the mother of every abomination on the face of this earth. Either believe God or the news media. The media is Satan's mouth.</description>

<description>The New Testament is written in the blood. So the life is in the New Testament. When we're reading the Word of God you're drinking the blood. And you're doing it in remembrance of Jesus. He showed this cup to Susie that she had drink. She had to go from this world into Heaven. He asked her, will you drink this cup and Susie said yes. Drink it and it will be quite awhile and you will raise from the dead and you and Tony will be the two witnesses.</description>

<description>When people don't want to listen to God, they don't want to walk with him. But, there was a man in the world that walked with God. His name was Enoch and he must come back to earth soon. Because he walked with God, God took him without having him to die. So he has to come back to earth in order to die. Because the Word of God states it is appointed unto man once to die. Just like Elijah who came in the form of John the Baptist. And he said that he wasn't Elijah but he was. I believe without any shadow of a doubt that I am Enoch.</description>

FLDS children are taken to a Catholic orphanage and you know Catholic Priests are child molesters.</description>

<description>Wherefore receive you one another. It's a commandment of the Lord. As Christ also received us to the glory of God. How does God get glory for that? Because He gets more sons and daughters. It honors God when you show Satan and the rest of the world that you keep God's commandments.</description>

<description>Dee and Harvey were in charge of a little motel in Tempe Arizona. Harvey didn't look to the left or right when he shot out into the street, he did the same thing again. The Lord said he would get killed or seriously injured. A few days later I get a call and a big mac truck was coming down the road and he shot out in front of it and it knocked his life string loose. She is paralyzed for life. They can't move. When he's eating snot is coming out of his nose. The Lord was telling me to tell him and it came to pass.</description>

You can be angry at me and say that I'm doing all kinds of evil things and I'm not doing them. So what you're doing is attempting to curse me for something I'm not doing wrong. I'm not doing anything that the Lord didn't tell me to do. So bless them which persecute you. I'm blessing you, I'm telling you what the Word of God says.</description>

<description>Satan obscures the way that we're supposed to be in order to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. So he hides how to get into the Kingdom of Heaven He causes distractions. When you go in to pray to the Lord the phone will ring or something will happen. You've got to contact God. Satan is doing everything he can to hide or to put out of focus the way into Heaven. This is what Satan does that's his job.</description>

But God is starting to raise heaven to them. He sent us into the world to preach the gospel to you ignoramuses and because you don't listen He's pouring out his wrath over in Missouri, Arkansas, Texas and all over the world. We're not going to join together with you bunch of heathen. You must join us if you want to go to heaven.</description>

I would suggest that you really don't have more than one wife, because if you have more than one wife you're going to have more than one mother-in-law. And some peoples mother-in-laws are ok I guess but if you had 10, 15, 16, 25 wives then your going to have 10, 15, 16, 25 mother-in-laws.</description>

<description>Lord you said that those police officers and all those different people that are taking the children away from their parents that you're going to take their children away. They said ha, ha, that isn't going to happen. Just like Pharaoh did when you destroyed Egypt and opened the Red Sea. They forget about all these things. Whatever you sow you're going to reap.</description>

<description>I've got a very strong message from the Lord it's prophecy against the government and the news media. The Lords going to take the first born of everybody that is involved with the taking away of the children in Texas and loves to see the children separated from their mothers. The Lords going to take them. If this doesn't come to pass well then you'll know I'm a false prophet. Brace yourselves you evil ones out there for something that you're not going to like. God said He's going to rejoice over you when He starts taking your kids away from you.</description>

<description>I believe the government and media is condemning the FLDS Church for not being a part of this satanic society that we happen to be living in. We're in it but we're not a part of it. We're like lambs and they are like lambs among wolves. How does it feel for you people out there to know that God calls you wolves and for God to call the government the beast and for God to call the antichrist cult in Rome the great whore? The mother of every abomination on the face of this earth. Oh, that must make you feel proud.</description>

<description>Jesus showed us that He was compassionate to those that love to keep the commandments and He was telling people they're going to hell. He called them devils, He called people vipers, snakes, dogs, and pigs and He fashioned a whip. People don't like to receive the gospel the way that it really is. But God is the way the Bible says He is.</description>

<description>The Bible says people would betray one another in the last days. They did this in Germany when they wanted anyone to, if you see a Jew let us know immediately so we can capture them and put them in prison and then take them into the ovens or the death chambers to the places where we burn them. This is the Vatican, folks, is the most dangerous organization on earth. They are not of God.</description>

<description>While in jail I went on a fast because I wanted to get an answer from the Lord. All the people of the Lord when there was something like this happening to them they started fasting but the news media said I was attempting suicide. They're a filthy bunch of liars they just make up anything they want to say in order to have a sensational story so people just listen to them and people have itchy ears to hear any false thing about anybody that's really doing a good job for people and a good job for the Lord. Why would I want to commit suicide when I know I am innocent.</description>

<description>Polygamy is fine with the Lord. But not 'serial polygamy' where you divorce a woman that you have and then you get another one.  The Lord gives recompense to the type of people that believe that lighting a candle or saying 'Hail Mary' and all these ridiculous things or people that preach 'God is all love' and there's no recompense for preaching sin, all these people are going to hell.  Baptists and Catholics go out and commit fornication all the time. Polygamy was NEVER condemned by God.</description>

We have to turn completely from the world and give our hearts to the Kingdom of Heaven. All that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.</description>

<description>All the people of the earth are going to bow down before the Lord. Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess when the Lord's coming back, thou art God, thou art God, thou art God. As though that's going to please the Lord. They knew that before but they just wanted to live their own life and impress their wives.</description>
