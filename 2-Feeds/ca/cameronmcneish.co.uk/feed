			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHEN people think of the National Trust for Scotland I&#8217;m sure they automatically tune in to country houses, gardens and castles but the Trust is responsible for looking after some of the mountain properties in Scotland. Iconic properties indeed, like Glen Coe, Torridon, Kintal, Affric, Ben Lawers, the Cairngorms, Arran and in the Borders.</p>
<p>Many of these areas exhibit some of the finest examples of footpath maintenance you&#8217;ll find anywhere, indeed the NTS has always been instrumental in the training and promotion of footpath skills, but such activity is hugely expensive and the NTS, like everyone else, doesn&#8217;t have unlimited cash.</p>
<p>I know the difficulties. After chairing the Nevis Partnership for a number of years I&#8217;m more than aware how difficult it is to compete for funding these days and it&#8217;s very rare for hillwalkers and climbers to be asked to help support organisations like the Nevis Partnership and the NTS.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve happily endorsed a wee scheme from the NTS to try and raise some money to help this vital work in their mountain properties. It&#8217;s called One Wee Step and you&#8217;ll find more about it <a href="http://oneweestep.org/Home.aspx">here</a>. I hope you can take that wee step and help us.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SPENT an interesting weekend filming with the Adventure Show. Regular presenter Dougie Vipond was taking part in the Snow Roads Audax, a massive 300km ride with 16500 feet of climbing over some of the classic &#8217;snow roads&#8217; in the eastern highlands - the Cairn o&#8217;Mount, the Cabrach, the Lecht, Gairnshiel and Glenshee.</p>
<p>Dougie did brilliantly - the furthest he had ridden in a day before was 120 miles so bumping that up to 180 miles, with all that climbing thrown in for good measure, was quite an achievement for him. He did it in 18.5 hours and despite having problems with his chain, his derrailleur and his guts, he coped magnificently.</p>
<p>What I found most interesting was the general camaraderie amongst these audax enthusiasts. Someone described an addax to me as a cycling event for middle-aged men with beards and rickety old bikes with mudguards and lights, and while there may be an element of truth in that I found the Snow Roads event to be exactly the kind of event I would want to take part in, an event where people looked out for each other and actually helped each other complete the course. There were incredible parallels with the TGO Challenge in that sense.</p>
<p>Dougie had some problems with his chain in the first few miles and that put him back a bit in terms of time, so he was playing catch-up all day. When it was obvious he had a broken link in his chain a little group suddenly appeared with all kind of tools and toolkits and soon had him on the roads again. He bought a new chain in the bike shop in Banchory. Several times other cyclists mentioned to me that they would make sure Dougie made it and certainly, at all times, there were little groups waiting for him, supporting him and encouraging him, all the way to the end, especially when he went through a pretty bad patch when he had been sick and had some pretty severe stomach problems.</p>
<p>I knew very little about audax events before this weekend and I was really, really impressed. Might even consider doing one myself in the future!</p>
<p>We were filming the whole thing for a future Adventure Show which will probably be broadcast later in the year. Look out for it, should make some good and interesting television. And well done Dougie Vipond, a very impressive performance</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE title reminds me of a Willie Nelson song and it comes to mind as I pack the the camper van for a week, literally, on the road.</p>
<p>Down the road to Edinburgh this evening for a night at Mortonhall and a bright start tomorrow to attend the launch of <em>Yes Scotland</em>, and the campaign for the independence referendum. The politics stuff is also fairly new to me, or at least the politics stuff with a large P. I&#8217;ve been involved in conservation politics for as long as I can remember but I&#8217;ve realised very quickly that the best way to influence politics is to get involved. Should be an interesting launch with the other pro-independence parties, the Greens and SSP, taking part as well. Not sure who&#8217;ll be there - the press are making a big thing of the world&#8217;s best known Scot being there (no not me). Sean Connery has been a staunch supporter of the SNP and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll love to see an independent Scotland in his lifetime.</p>
<p>Incidentally, someone tweeted me from Englandshire earlier today and asked why there had to be winners and losses in an independence referendum. Why can&#8217;t we all be winners? I firmly believe Scotland can thrive as an independent nation and the other parts of the UK could thrive too. Indeed, I think England in particular could regain some of its national identity which in recent times only seems to surface at internation football or rugby names. The song <em>Roots</em>, by the south-west folk duo Show of Hands, sums it up well.</p>
<p>Following the campaign launch I&#8217;ll be driving down to the Borders, or may be even the Lake District, so I can get a bit of a hill walk in on Saturday morning for after that I have to drive to Oxford. The Camping and Caravanning Club have an excellent site there and I&#8217;ve booked in for the night leaving me relatively short drive next day down to Portsmouth and a lunchtime ferry to the Isle of Wight. I&#8217;ll be there for 2 or 3 days while some work is being done on my camper van.</p>
<p>Why Isle of Wight? Well that&#8217;s where the Romahome factory is and the guys are doing some major conversion work for me. I took the camper back to the factory last year for some work and Gina and I had a great couple of days walking on the island, with a lot of help from <em>Wight Walks. </em>This time I&#8217;ll be on my own so I plan to get a couple of walks written up for TGO Magazine while I&#8217;m in the deep south. Killing several birds with one stone if you like.</p>
<p>After that it&#8217;ll be a fairly quick drive north again for next weekend I&#8217;ll be supporting my pal and colleague Dougie Vipond as he attempts the massive Snow Roads Sportive over the Lecht and over the Glenshee hills, a real marathon of a road race. Can&#8217;t miss seeing Dougie suffering&#8230;</p>
<p>So apart from all the driving involved it should be a good week, especially if this superb weather keeps up. Fingers crossed&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here in Badenoch summer seems to have arrived. Enjoyed my breakfast in the garden this morning. Birds singing, grass growing at last and blue skies overhead. It even felt pleasantly warm. Lovely.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at the same time I sat outside our camper van in the camp site at Keswick and similarly enjoyed the sun, along with dozens of others. Keswick was jam-packed at the weekend, a testament I think to the ongoing popularity of the Keswick Mountain Festival. Well done to Kate and her team for another great event.</p>
<p>Although it was warm andy sunny yesterday Saturday was a pretty mixed bag. 15 Festival-goers joined me for a guided walk up Skiddaw, a walk that saw us huddled together for warmth on the summit of the hill. It was freezing - the trig point was frosted up and there were bits of ice in the wind, a gale force easterly. Thankfully the weather improved on the descent and we came out of the mist just above Skiddaw House. Stopped there for a bit and had a brew with the wardens. What a great little youth hostel this is. Of the traditional kind of hostel, I think I must plan a weekend there sometime in the future. Great atmosphere, lovely people and a terrific location, Back o&#8217; Skiddaw.</p>
<p>Many thanks also to everyone who came along to my talk on Friday night. It was a busy night with myself, Helen Skelton and Monty Halls talking. Nice to meet Helen and Monty and hear of their adventures and thanks also to everyone at Nordic Outdoor for the drinks and roll-mop herring after the talk. It was great to wind down and simply have a blether with like-minded people before heading along to the Old Keswickian for fish and chips. Rounded off a grand day.</p>
<p>A busy week ahead. Book writing will keep me indoors for much of the week before the TGO Challenge dinner on Thursday evening. On Friday I&#8217;ve been invited to attend the big launch of the Independence Referendum in Edinburgh - hope to maybe meet the likes of Sir Sean! After that it&#8217;s a long drive down to the Isle of Wight for some repairs to my campervan at the Romahome factory. Time permitting I&#8217;ll get a couple of good coastal walks done on the island before the long drive home again. Phew - I&#8217;m knackered even thinking about it all. Have a good week.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>I wonder if anyone else thinks the BBC has made a massive cock-up in having Julia Bradbury and Richard Hammond as presenters for Planet Earth live? Julia Bradbury is just incredibly lightweight, no doubt a very pleasant person, and how can Hammond make the jump from Top Gear, one of the most anti-enviroment shows on the telly, to discussing saving wild elephants? Essentially he can&#8217;t. He sounds completely hypocritical and false. Why didn&#8217;t the BBC ask Simon King and Gordon Buchanan, for example, to present the show. Both respected naturalists and bloody good television presenters. Bradbury should stick with daytime television and Hammond should go back to driving cars.</span></p>
<p>I have had a relatively small scale television career but I&#8217;ve always been careful to stick with what I know. A number of years ago I was asked to present a series about caravanning, but turned it down on the basis that I knew nothing about caravans. Similarly, I&#8217;ve been asked to appear on various quiz shows and reality shows but have always said no simply because I want to stick with what I know and love most, climbing mountains and exploring wild places.</p>
<p>I find it sad that there are so many talented naturalists around who don&#8217;t get an opportunity to present their knowledge on telly - I could name a handful here in Scotland who are great television presenters, but the BBC has this thing about celebrity presenters, like Bradbury, Hammond, Kate Humble and others, who know very little about the activity they are so supposed to be presenting. Look at the difference with the presenters who have knowledge, presenters who are involved first and foremost in the various activities because they love to do it. People like Nick Crane, Monty Hall, Simon King and Gordon Buchanan. Even Bill Oddie, bless him, is a first and foremost talented and hugely enthusiastic ornithologist who must have been really pissed off having to appear with someone as apparently clueless as Kate Humble. At least when Gryff Rhys Jones presented the series Mountain he didn&#8217;t claim to be a mountaineer. Far from it, he downplayed his own ability.</p>
<p>It really is time the BBC stopped pandering to mass public opinion and stopped using these celebrity types in what should be specialist roles. It just doesn&#8217;t do the BBC any credit - and makes for boring television.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;M looking forward to heading down to my favourite English town later this week for the Keswick Mountain Festival. I&#8217;m giving a talk on Friday (and there are still tickets left) and leading a walk to Skiddaw on Saturday morning (fully booked I&#8217;m afraid) and in between I&#8217;m sure there will be a good bit of socialising going on.</p>
<p>I always enjoy these events. It&#8217;s a great time to meet old friends and make new ones, catch up on the outdoor scene in general and enjoy that feeling of tribalism, that we belong to a large bunch of enthusiasts from around the country, indeed, around the globe, who can get together every so often and share experiences, fun and laughter. And a few beers to boot.</p>
<p>And Keswick is the ideal place for this kind of event. Never mind what they say in other places Keswick is the adventure capital of the UK - it&#8217;s always full of hill goers and climbers, no matter the time of year, and it&#8217;s a friendly town with some great pubs and restaurants.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not yet sure what the weather forecast holds for the weekend but if it looks good then there&#8217;s plenty going on out of doors on the fells around Keswick. If the weather is shitty then there&#8217;s still plenty to of with a wide array of talks and films to enjoy. Chris Bonington, Mick Fowler, Pauline Sanderson, Monty Halls and Helen Skelton are the speakers this year, and me of course, and there&#8217;s a bunch of stuff happening about mountain biking too. So, if you have nothing else in your diary you could do worse then come along to Keswick, a lot worse. For anyone who&#8217;d like to come to my talk on Friday night at 6pm then you can book here: <a href="http://www.keswickmountainfestival.co.uk/programme/speaker-programme/cameron-mcneish/">www.keswickmountainfestival.co.uk/programme/speaker-programme/cameron-mcneish/</a></p>
<p>See you there?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HAD an excellent meeting during the week with Scottish Natural Heritage about the Gore-Tex Scottish National Trail we&#8217;ll be launching later in the year.</p>
<p>I would emphasise that this is not a new trail we are developing but a route that uses existing trails and paths as much as possible between Kirk Yetholm in the Scottish Borders and Cape Wrath in the far North-West highlands. Inevitably there will be areas where there are currently no recognised paths so SNH have been really helpful in offering advice, plus details for all the trail managers and local authority contacts.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already started filming the project for two television programmes to be broadcast over Christmas and New Year later this year and I&#8217;ll shortly being going into purdah to try and write the book. Could be a long summer&#8230;</p>
<p>For anyone interested I&#8217;ve written out the route below but I should say that it is not cast in stone just yet. There are one or two other options war are looking at and some of the points have to be checked out with landowners, local authorities and the various trail managers but this route will give you a rough idea of the line we are taking.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WE woke this morning to wind and rain. Would you believe it? Fortunately by the time we had breakfast the front had moved through and the sun dried everything up in no time at all. I was more than a little concerned because we had planned to film an ascent of a Via Feratta today, the steepest and most sustained &#8220;iron way&#8221; in the area, and the last thing I would have wanted to do was climb the thing in the rain. Limestone becomes very slippery when it&#8217;s wet and I guess the metal rungs would have been pretty slippery too.</p>
<p>By the time we drove round to the base of the crag the weather had improved dramatically and we were joined by Jose&#8217;s long standing pal, Jamie. Jamie finished in 14 th place in a recent Tour of Mont Blanc fell running race and is a keen and talented outdoors guy. As is Jose. I should say a word or two about Jose before I tell you about the Via Feratta.</p>
<p>I first met Jose away back in 1999 when I came over here with a group of journalists to see what his company, Terra Ferma, was getting up to in the Sierra Aitana area. I came back with Gina a couple of years later and we had a fantastic week in the nearby Marina Alta, just along the coast. Since then Jose has started a new company called Aitana Adventures and he does a lot of work with trekking companies like Exodus, as well as being part of a cooperative farm here in Sella. He&#8217;s a cracking lad and a first class guide and I had no hesitation in agreeing to climb this Via Feratta with him.</p>
<p>The route in question is 250m in length and is pretty vertical for almost all the way. It was established 6 years ago by a couple of local climbers and it was paid for by the local town hall. It doesn&#8217;t cost anything to use, which surprised me a bit, and there is no &#8216;policing&#8217; of it in the sense that anyone can do it if they have the proper equipment and experience. There are warning signs at the foot of the crag pointing out the dangers to those who perhaps are not experienced enough.</p>
<p>I loved it. Via Feratta take hill walkers like me into climbers territory and this one in particular takes you into the world of the vertical. It begins steeply, climbs over a prominent bulge, then stays steep and sustained all the way. There were only really two points where it was feasible for Simon to stop and film us; one was a little niche in the rock where he could just squeeze past us and the other, higher up, was a little section of narrow ridge connecting two very steep noses. It was exciting stuff with amazing views out to sea and towards the skyscraper skyline of nearby Benidorm.</p>
<p>I must admit I rather enjoyed the via Feratta but I&#8217;m still not convinced about them from an ethical/environmental point of view. I think I can state categorically I wouldn&#8217;t like to see them developed in Scotland. I don&#8217;t think we have the size of crag or the scope of terrain that would allow for any decent route and I rather think it could be the thin end of the wedge to taming the likes of the Cuillin ridge or the Aonach Eagach. Having said that, I did enjoy this one and via ferattas appear to be accepted here as part of outdoor tourism. Have a look at the programme when it comes out, probably sometime in June, and see what you think. The Adventure Show, BBC Scotland.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I suppose you could call it Sod&#8217;s Law or tempting fate or the climate change gods revenge for flying to Spain but we woke to a day of threatening rain. Would you believe it? At least it was mild.</p>
<p>Jose Miguel drove us round the mountain to Benifato where we parked the car and climbed up through lovely almond terraces to the mixed scrubs and screes just below the long ridge of the Sierra Aitana. From there we climbed up to the ridge with a little bit of scrambling thrown in for good measure before squeezing through a gap that the English guidebook describes appropriately as Fat Man&#8217;s Agony. I was delighted not to suffer so maybe I have slimmed down a little on the recent End to End bike ride.</p>
<p>Just as we reached the summit it began raining so we had to film our summit shots pretty rapidly before heading down. Needless to say the rain went off as we descended.</p>
<p>It was a good walk nevertheless and on the way back Jose pointed out the route of our via feratta for tomorrow. Looks pretty steep and sustained, real rock climbing territory. I know Simonnis a little concerned about how best to film it but I guess without any abseil ropes to dangle from he&#8217;ll just have to climb below us, or shoot us from above. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll work it out.</p>
<p>Back at Sella things were in full swing with the annual Paella Festival well underway. Various families and groups from the village cook paella and compete with each other for the best. I didn&#8217;t realise it but paella is a local Valencian speciality and there is a great pride in being vote the best. Needless to say we tried some, washed down with some local,wine and beer, and filmed the whole shebang. It was great fun, lots of music and enthusiasm and by the time we got back to our digs at Casaroc we were knackered.</p>
<p>During the festival I met up with a couple of old friends, th writer and poet Terry Gifford and his partner Gill Round. They told me I must visit them but I spent about 40 minutes looking for their house only to discover it was only a couple of doors down from Casaroc. And they weren&#8217;t in, probably still enjoying the paella festivities&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had about an hour just showering and relaxing and now we&#8217;re heading for the bar for a meal and a beer or two. Filming the via feratta tomorrow could be a long day, and we really need to be fresh for it.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IT was raining in Glasgow this morning and the weather forecast is suggesting cold and snow for the May Bank Holiday weekend. At the moment I&#8217;m sitting in a balcony in the Spanish village of Sella overlooking a fabulous mountain called the Puig Campana and at 7 at night it&#8217;s still warm and balmy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with Simon Willis and we&#8217;re working on a piece for BBC Scotland&#8217;s Adventure Show. The idea is that you can leave Scotland on a Friday, have an adventure filled weekend in the Costa Blanca and be back in Scotland on Monday. Most folk associate the Costa Blanca with sun sand and sangria and we had a quick visit to Benidorm to film some of that but the contrast with the mountains behind the town is amazing, as is the contrast in the weather between Scotland and Spain. It&#8217;s a different world&#8230;</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve met up with my old friend Jose Miguel who runs walking and climbing holidays in this part of Spain. We&#8217;ll be doing a bit of hiking in the Sierra de Aitana and having a go at a new Via Ferrata that&#8217;s been created here but there&#8217;s also a paella making competition going on this weekend and I&#8217;ll be keen to visit that. But what has been really interesting today is looking over an organic finca, or farm,that Jose operates with 14 others. It&#8217;s run on a cooperative basis and they provide enough eggs and veggies to do them all year round. What&#8217;s more the cooperative operate on a barter system where someone might supply wood for log stoves in exchange for eggs while someone else might do a day&#8217;s painting in return for a day&#8217;s babysitting. With a 25% unemployment rate in Spain, yes, 1 in 4 out of work, this cooperative system could be seen as something of a green revolution.</p>
<p>If anything good can come out of the current economic situation then surely it has to be a quiet revolution like this. It&#8217;s also a kick back against consumerism, globalisation and the corporate greed that sees large supermarket chains decimating small retailers throughout the country.</p>
<p>We filmed with Jose in his farm, had a fabulous lunch of some of the organic produce and we&#8217;re just about to hit the bar for some beer and tapas. Is it organic tapas? I&#8217;m afraid I have absolutely no idea. I&#8217;m only going for the beer.</p>
