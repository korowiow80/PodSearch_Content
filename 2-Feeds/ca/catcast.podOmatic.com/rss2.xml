      <title>Vidcast #48 - JaiDee Nearly Grown Up!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/26243/600x600_6385469.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is little JaiDee (Good Heart in Thai) at eleven months old. She is still as playful as she ever was as a kitten. She is beautiful and affectionate! Although she is pure Persian she is a small female. One of my favorite things about JaiDee is that when you carry her in your arms she simply relaxes and gazes into your eyes, listening to your every word. My wife says she is her favorite cat, which is saying a lot because Persia and Simba were our gentle giant Maine Coon Cats. But we had to leave them with friends in Australia. So sad. We never thought we would love again, until JaiDee came along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems that the majority of you really like this video series. But please let us know if you want to go back to a few more audio podcasts occasionally as well.

      <title>Vidcast #44 - Pixie Bob Kittens</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/26243/600x600_4044686.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pixie-Bob breed seems to have everything going for it: an intelligent, playful personality, a strong resemblance to the American Bobcat and an origin clouded in mystery and legend. Thought to be descended from matings between bobcats and house/barn cats, DNA testing has so far failed to prove a link to a wild ancestor.

Pixie Bob History
The Pixie-Bob is an American breed. The first Pixie-Bob was believed to be the issue of a random mating, between a small Coastal Red Bobcat and a short-tailed polydactyl barn cat. Carol Ann Brewer,
of Washington State, purchased a male polydactyl kitten from the resulting litter in 1985. Because of the many legends, surrounding such matings between wild and domestic cats, she dubbed this first kitten a &quot;Legend Cat&quot;. Within a year, Ms. Brewer had acquired a few more of these cats and began to establish the Pixie-Bob breed.

One female kitten, named Pixie, became the dam line and namesake for the breed. The Pixie-Bob was accepted into TICA as &quot;new breed and color&quot; in 1995 and for Championship status in 1997. Currently, only TICA and CCA accept the Pixie-Bob for registry.
It should be noted that there is also an &quot;American Bobtail&quot; breed,
accepted as a separate cat breed by TICA and recognized by the CFA as well. This breed has a different breed history, but it does share some physical characteristics, notably the bobbed tail.

The Pixie-Bob is muscular, with a heavy bone structure. Males will typically mature to 12-26 pounds, with females a bit smaller. The coat is double one and can feature spots, broken bars and rosett
Colors are shades of brown or russet, with silver or black t is short (a minimum of two inches) and is carried high. Ey deep-set. Brown and gold colored eyes are preferred but accepted. Many Pixie-Bobs also have lynx-pointed ear tuft is common, with a maximum of seven toes per paw. This i breeds wherein polydactylism is accepted for registry.

The Pixie Bob is a hardy breed with no special care needs. Some breeders have raised concern about the effect of certain vaccines may have on cats of this breed. Pixie Bob cat o consult with both the breeder and veterinarian about their cat's vaccine plan. &lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/26243/600x600_3620033.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Munchkin Cat is a naturally occurring domestic cat with short legs. Because they originate from a domestic cat, they come in all colors, can range in height, and will weigh anywhere from 5 to 9 lbs full-grown. Although they were not introduced into the cat fancy until the 1980's, they were seen dating as far back as the 1940's.&lt;br&gt;
The personality of a Munchkin could be described as playful, sweet, social, and easy going. They like to spend time with their owners and enjoy lots of attention. They seem to have magpie tendencies, and love to hide things. One of my favorite Munchkin quirks is when they play or just want to look at something; they stand on their rear legs similar to a Prairie Dog.&lt;br&gt;
Grooming a Munchkin is no different from grooming any domestic cat. Short hair Munchkins should be brushed once a week to help shed dead hair, and the long hair Munchkins should be brushed twice a week to get any tangles or mats out. Like any cat, they need a good quality diet, regular vet visits, and kind human attention.&lt;br&gt;
The Munchkin does not have any specific health problems that are associated with the short legs. A common misconception is that they have the same spinal weakness as the Dachshund dog. Because cats have such a flexible spinal column this does not pose a problem for the Munchkins. The short front legs do not hamper them in any way. They can run, walk, and jump just like a normal cat would. You will find them jumping onto counter tops, climbing cat trees, and running through the house just as you would most cats.&lt;br&gt;

They can run, walk, and jump just like a normal cat would. You will find them jumping onto counter tops, climbing cat trees, and running through the house just as you would most cats.

      <title>Vidcast #41 - Scottish Fold Kittens</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/26243/600x600_1077018.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the beginning of a new series on pure bred kittens. Have you ever wanted to know what these lovely pedigree felines look like in &quot;munchkin&quot; season. Well, stay tuned to Kitty Cat Cast as we will be bringing you the cutest little kitten cat breeds in video to dazzle the eyes and touch the heart!&lt;br&gt;In its early years, this unique breed of folded eared cats was met with scorn at its native British Islands but has since rapidly progressed to become one of the top ten most popular breeds in the world. Today, the distinctly round face with forward folded ears charms cat lovers everywhere.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Scottish Fold Cats - Breed History&lt;/b&gt;
The Scottish Fold breed originated from Susie, a cat that lived on a farm in Perthsire, Scotland during the early 1960s. Susie was a white mixed breed cat with one exceptional feature - her ears were folded.
William Ross, a local shepherd with an interest in purebred cats, noticed Susie and obtained one of her kittens, another ear folded cat. Shortly after that Susie died, leaving behind only one more folded kitten - a neutered male. Ross contacted Pat Turner, a London breeder with an interest in feline genetics, and so a breeding program for folded eared cats was established.&lt;br&gt;
At first, British cat fancy associations rejected the breed on the grounds that the folded ears gene was compromising the health of these cats. In the early 1970s a breeding program was established in the United States and by the end of that decade, the Scottish Fold gained championship status at the cat shows.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Scottish Fold Cats - Breed Description&lt;/b&gt;
The most prominent feature of any Scottish Fold cat is of course the ears, which must fold forward and downward. The ears are usually small and tightly folded, giving the cat's head a unique round silhouette. The head shape itself is also round, with prominent cheeks, a short nose and well rounded large eyes.&lt;br&gt;
Scottish Folds are medium sized cats and can be either short haired or long haired. All colors and patterns are acceptable except for pointed patterns that suggest hybridization with Siamese or Himalayan cats.
These cats are considered to be sweet tempered and intelligent. These docile cats are not very vocal and form deep attachments with their loved humans.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Scottish Fold Cats - Special Needs&lt;/b&gt;
The gene responsible for the folded ear mutation is a dominant gene. This means that if the gene is passed from one of the parents, it is enough to produce a folded kitten. If both parents contribute the folded gene, the kitten is likely to suffer from congenital osteodystrophy, a genetic condition that causes deformities of the bones (especially fused tail vertebrae and thickened legs). That is why responsible breeders never breed one Scottish Fold to another - all Scottish Folds must be constantly outbred to prevent the birth of sick kittens.&lt;br&gt;
Healthy Scottish Folds appear not to have any special health or grooming problems. These cats are not particularly prone to ear infections or ear mites, as was suspected some years ago.

It has a nice balance between the unique personalities of cats and the deep love and affection that they create in their owners. Enjoy! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LYRICS:
I got this little kitty about 2 months back
he was the nicest little kitty, now a pain in my crack
This little kitty is a ninja, always stalking my feet
This little kitty is a warrior you know what I mean
&lt;br&gt;
he's an evil little kitty look what he did to my hand
tries to get in trouble in any way that he can
I could give this cat a toy, but he'd rather have the wrapper
and I will always give him water, but he still drinks from the crapper
&lt;br&gt;
You could lock him in a closet and he just won't care
kitty chews on my shoes and he licks my hair
always scratching on my favorite chair and jumping on the couch
playing in the window sills and tearing through the house
&lt;br&gt;
He's so full of energy and easily amused
kitty will attack anything that moves
Causing trouble, starting battles just so he could be a little part of
he's a meanest little kitty so we named him sparta
&lt;br&gt;
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite
&lt;br&gt;
Where'd you go
are you stalking me?
are you under the couch, quite possibly
ears laid back so you don't get caught
ready to pounce my leg with everything that you got
&lt;br&gt;
I know you're probably watching me from across the room
concentrating contemplating on attacking me soon
You're not invisible kitty, I'm gonna find you first
Come out come out before I make things worse
&lt;br&gt;
I've seen where you hide and I know where you've been
Hey kitty why don't you give in
Even if you try to sneak up on me, I'm prepared
Cause I've got my safety gear on and I'm not scared
&lt;br&gt;
I think I hear a kitty cat under the bed
I know your making noises just to mess with my head
You can stalk me all you want, but I'm not your pray
cause you always seem to find me first, but not today
&lt;br&gt;
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
Come on out, I'm gonna get you now
&lt;br&gt;
I've got 'em cornered
and now he's mine
He's not gonna get away this time
I'll snatch him up fast before he can blink and then...
Aw man! He's asleep in the sink
&lt;br&gt;
What is with this cat? I'm confused
He's got a bed, but it's never been used
In every waking moment, kitty's out for the fight
then [fart] next minute kitty's out like a light
&lt;br&gt;
How could I let this creature live inside of my home
I gotta keep an eye on him when I'm on the phone
I'm a little afraid to leave this cat all alone
this kitty may destroy everything that I own
&lt;br&gt;
Look at him now, I kinda feel bad
He's the best little cat that I've had
and the one big thing I forgot to mention, was that
He wasn't fighting, he just wanted attention
&lt;br&gt;
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
little bitty kitty wanna bite bite bite
Hey little sparta what is with all the fight
showing love, that's all this kitty does

      <title>Special Episode - Maine Coon Companions - pdf</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/26243/600x600_812887.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maine Coon Companions Special Report:

The Maine Coon is unique. Most owners agree that the easy going temperament and clownish behaviour are characteristics associated with the breed. The distinctive look of the cat with its long &#8220;racoon&#8221; tail and &#8220;lynx tip ears is well known.  
 
In order to give the best care to these special cats, we need to know what specific issues and concerns to look out for. As an owner of two purebred Maine Coon boys, I&#8217;ve found advice on health care specifically tailored for the breed, a little difficult to come across at times. The local veterinarians I&#8217;ve personally consulted have had little knowledge of Maine Coons as a breed, as they do not see enough of them to see patterns and common problems. Over time I&#8217;ve gleaned information from a variety of sources on the kinds of special care and attention the gentle giant needs to maintain optimum health. 
 
The truth is that Maine Coons do have specific requirements in addition to certain conditions that have been found in the breed that owners need to be aware of. This especially applies to people looking for Maine Coon kittens and those new to the breed.  There are certain things you need to know as a caring owner.

This is like lying in wait for &quot;Big Foot&quot;, never knowing exactly when he would do his thing! Well, finally it happened! I have caputre a bit of the amazing sounds that this wonderful breed of kitty cat can make. Certainly there are many more sounds that he makes regularly, but these are some of the weirdest! In a future podcast I hope to capture him singing to the whole household or announcing to us all that he is about to go to the bathroom! Yes, there is never a dull moment with Simba!  Oh, and by the way, we just celebrated his 5th birthday on the 24th of January. Meow...&lt;br&gt;
