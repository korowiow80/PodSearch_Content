It was called the Rock n Roll Museum, for some reason, but it did little to disguise the fact that it was a merch house, a place to purchase Clash pencil cases, mod target tea-cups and &lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/101_3645.JPG"&gt;Queen belts&lt;/a&gt;. I maintain that we only spent a few minutes there, but I'm sure Missy Laur insists we spent hours walking around, fondling every item from every section, from Britpop to Hair Metal. I only wish I'd bought something. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; It's rare to get excited about band merch, although I can recall instances where I have marvelled at an excessively priced item at a gig (navy blue tshirt at Coldplay, 2003; light blue tshirt at the Faint, 2004; navy blue tshirt at New Order, 2012). I often bemoan their lack of originality, either the band tshirts are so incredibly large that they can comfortably house 2-3 males (black tshirt at Pet Shop Boys, 2007) or in the case of female tshirts, they shrink and rise up (black tshirt at Bloc Party, 2005).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I like to imagine that there is a marked increase in the creativity of band tshirts. Sure, many of Ben Sherman's licensed Beatles t-shirts still mirror their album artwork but there are also more obtuse references to the band in their collection. My favourite is a print from the opening moments of the film Yellow Submarine: men standing on rooftops, wearing trenchcoats and bowler hats, holding umbrellas. It's only a momentary shot but those who have seen it, know it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XPi9Uv-ASo0/T5peV5nnTZI/AAAAAAAACH0/OiBLGqrs7aw/s1600/DSC00038.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-XPi9Uv-ASo0/T5peV5nnTZI/AAAAAAAACH0/OiBLGqrs7aw/s320/DSC00038.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; For now, I must pack my bags as I honestly have no time left. I'll pack my various band tshirts, my Beatles, Queen and my favourite Pet Shop Boys tshirt (with the artwork from their 1987 single, Heart). I'm unsure whether Japanese passers-by will recognise such references brandished across my chest, but then, that's not really the point: I get it. But then I have to remind myself that it's not always the point, after all there was that time I accosted a poor Korean girl atop the Capitoline Hill in Rome. I stopped to marvel at &lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/DSC02631.JPG"&gt;her stunning Style Council tshirt&lt;/a&gt; and she had absolutely no idea what I was talking about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I've decided to leave you all with a podcast in celebration of our momentary jaunt to Japan!

I contemplated his arrogance, I analysed his appeal. I read journal articles about notions of masculinity and the "semiotics of Robert Plant's bare chest" (no, really). I returned to the same iconic live images, again and again. I never could quite articulate why it appealed to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Driven by my motivation to find out why, I set about constructing a radio documentary about the showman phenomenon. In my research efforts, I interviewed the most aggressively narcissistic person of my acquaintance. We didn't even make the five minute mark before he insulted me and I walked out of the interview. However, I did manage to extract something useful out of him in that short space of time. He told me that all expression of confidence is ultimately fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ever since that discussion, I have been looking for that &lt;i&gt;fakeness&lt;/i&gt; he was talking about, those subtle indications of doubt. Often, it is a vulnerability that is not apparent within the stage show itself. It becomes apparent in interviews, when a musician expresses a sad wail of frustration that they cannot get a gig at the Marquee. I see it where I had never seen it before, in the lyrics for Queen's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiPobLbB3ik"&gt;In the Lap of the Gods (Revisited)&lt;/a&gt;. Words that reveal a sadly universal fear, &lt;i&gt;no one believes in what we do&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hdc9lrSFbu4/T4aafr7ylVI/AAAAAAAACFQ/OnBwZjHF_eQ/s1600/tumblr_lhv0u5iilq1qdslbvo1_r1_500.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 229px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hdc9lrSFbu4/T4aafr7ylVI/AAAAAAAACFQ/OnBwZjHF_eQ/s320/tumblr_lhv0u5iilq1qdslbvo1_r1_500.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5730437445035660626" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://fuckyeahmercury.tumblr.com/"&gt;Fuck Yeah, Freddie Mercury&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a teenager, it would have been near impossible for me to have imagined Freddie nervous and in doubt. He was my perennial showman, the eternal signifier of what it meant to be choc-full of drive and confidence. I suppose you could say that my desire to be driven and confident was the source of my fascination. I can safely say that it's likely that it's this innermost desire that is central to the fascination of many other fans, who eagerly clamour to the railings of the stage to gape at their musician's antics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, my fascination with confidence doesn't seem to be as compelling as my fascination with doubt. Many of us may consciously (or subconsciously) desire to possess the arrogant bravado of a cocky showman. Perhaps it's not to the extent that we wish to flounce about stage in a Harlequin leotard, sure, but there is a lot to be said for having faith that there is value in who we are and what we do. I suppose I yearn for those subtle indicators of doubt in those I admire, as a reminder that although these doubts are universal, we are all capable of achieving great things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Yé Yé Podcast #42&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Leslie - Les Filles C'est Fait Pour Faire L'Amour&lt;br /&gt;Jocelyne - A La Fin Tu Gagneras&lt;br /&gt;Marie Laforêt - A Demain My Darling&lt;br /&gt;Carole Robert &amp; Improvistas - Le Fruit Defendu&lt;br /&gt;Anne Kern - Tant Pis, Tant Pis, Entre Donc (Come On In)&lt;br /&gt;Stella - Pourquoi Pas Moi&lt;br /&gt;Nino Ferrer - Mirza&lt;br /&gt;Richard Anthony - La Terre Promise&lt;br /&gt;Frank Alamo - Heureux Tous Les Deux&lt;br /&gt;Adèle - Je Ne Veux Plus D'accordéon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Yeye%20Podcast%20%2342.mp3"&gt;Download (38.4 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-6240256905914498960?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/6240256905914498960/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=6240256905914498960' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/6240256905914498960'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/6240256905914498960'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2012/04/i-had-long-been-consumed-with-confident.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hdc9lrSFbu4/T4aafr7ylVI/AAAAAAAACFQ/OnBwZjHF_eQ/s72-c/tumblr_lhv0u5iilq1qdslbvo1_r1_500.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-8805373025088871538</id><published>2012-03-28T06:05:00.008+11:00</published><updated>2012-03-28T07:59:43.394+11:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mix Tapes'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Funk'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Soul'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Erasure'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Order'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Depeche Mode'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>It's the only cassette we've been playing in the car for some time now. It's a special cassette, in that a facsimile copy of it exists on MiniDisc. It's also special, in that it has survived what could only be described as "chocolate-powder damage", sustained from residing at the bottom of my navy blue school-bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's the tenth year anniversary of this cassette, &lt;i&gt;El's Formal Tape&lt;/i&gt; and although I cringe when I am reminded of the unbelievable hype that accompanied this event, I cannot help but feel slightly warmed by the memory of its construction. After all, it was all done at the request of my date, TAFKATC, who insisted it was my task for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was an exceedingly important task, preparing a selection of songs for that 15-minute car ride together. On the scarce occasions when we did speak, we only ever bonded over 1980s synth pop... but they were terribly significant conversations and I had the tendency to retain them, as I had the tendency to retain everything. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, both myself and my best friend, Missy Laur had to deal with this problem, this &lt;i&gt;scarcity of time&lt;/i&gt; issue that tended to pervade every aspect of this absurd (and thoroughly implausible) partnership. Missy Laur and I whinced and made endless lists. We aggressively crossed out song names and with every strike-through came three new "consequential additions". It was a list that was impossible to cull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps if the car-ride had been 1,115 minutes long instead of 15, I could have included all the songs TAFKATC was responsible for. All that New Order, Erasure, Depeche Mode, The Smiths and The Cure. But this was my task and my challenge. It was an ordeal to deal with the technological restraints of his feeble MiniDisc and my rickety 90-minute cassette, but I loved it. I would have made more: &lt;i&gt;The Formal Mixes - Volumes 1 to 250&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now when I drive and listen to this cassette, I am baffled by some of my song choices. Paul Van Dyk's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNqT3yLZ9aw"&gt;For an Angel&lt;/a&gt;? Basement Jaxx's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bp5cTGcl2Qc"&gt;Bingo Bango&lt;/a&gt;? Really? Some other song inclusions make more sense, such as the brilliant New Order megamix and Erasure's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cy7nMlp18ZU"&gt;I Love Saturday&lt;/a&gt; from their 1994 album, &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Erasure-I-Say-I-Say-I-Say/master/18881"&gt;I Say, I Say, I Say&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was TAFKATC's objection to the degenerated sound quality of I Love Saturday that sticks out most in my memory of that whole car-ride. You see, Missy Laur and I had dubbed that song from my mix-tape to her mix-tape to my mix-tape (and so forth). It was emblematic, it somehow signified the love and reverence both she and I shared for this song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I was naive in thinking that this kind of connection could have existed for both him and I? Was I mad in imagining such a thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uB-0D-gV8mY/R7e-mpUZSRI/AAAAAAAAG4M/ppCTqaapFnQ/s1600/new%2Border"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nothing in this world can touch the music that I heard...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only I could have imagined what would follow, some ten years later. TAFKATC sent me an email with the subject line, &lt;i&gt;FAC&lt;/i&gt;, requesting my company to see New Order at Festival Hall. My 15 minutes had been extended to a full 90 minute set and I couldn't help but giggle as we sent texts to each other, dreaming of what songs they should play (and what cover band we'd inevitably form when Barney fails to meet our expectations).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to let my memories slip by when I think of TAFKATC. I am far too embarrassed to acknowledge the youthful flirtatiousness I once had... but then I can't help but feel it still when he looks at me, when he entertains my musings. I don't care to ever forget the moment before the band even started, when he handed me his plastic cup of beer to sip: "You're still 17." He smiled. I could hardly disguise my grin in response.

A book that would be definitive in its scope, a book that would have your name printed on the front cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I passed the link onto friends, we laughed and contemplated the albums we would dissect. We offered up the recordings that we knew absolutely, the ones which have become so thoroughly familiar that they course easily through the veins with every repeated listen. Every solo, every harmony, every lyric can be predicted and yet it manages to induce an unassailable rush of endorphins. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what to chose? &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Queen-Queen-I/master/5598"&gt;Queen I&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Queen-Queen-II/master/31526"&gt;Queen II&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Blur-The-Great-Escape/master/94767"&gt;The Great Escape&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Erasure-The-Innocents/master/18601"&gt;The Innocents&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Sean-Lennon-Friendly-Fire/master/276847"&gt;Friendly Fire&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Stills-Logic-Will-Break-Your-Heart/master/262335"&gt;Logic Will Break Your Heart&lt;/a&gt;? Mai god, &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Ace-Of-Base-Happy-Nation-US-Version/master/129586"&gt;Happy Nation (US Version)&lt;/a&gt;! There's just too much, too much...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I considered what it would be like to assemble a 40,000 word manuscript, I wondered how analysis would alter my pre-existing attachment to a terribly significant recording. Would I feel that same charge, that same rush of endorphins having ruthlessly dissected every aspect of the creative process? Would such an endeavour interfere (or even damage) the personal value of these recordings?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are resources available to the listeners who are interested enough to explore the history and development of a recording. There are endless interviews with &lt;a href="http://www.erasureinfo.com/news/blog.php"&gt;artists, producers, technicians and teaboys&lt;/a&gt;. There are sketchy &lt;a href="http://roxbytes.atw.hu/"&gt;demos on Casio keyboards&lt;/a&gt; which trace the development of a single song. In the instance of the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/events/60sseason/documentaries/sgtpeppers.shtml"&gt;40th anniversary of the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&lt;/a&gt;, there are even artists who go about recreating the entire recording process. Same studio, same equipment, same engineer, everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gxn4SY9FRGw/T0af5IrvP9I/AAAAAAAAB_I/E9YXjGb2kEA/s1600/tumblr_lthsgy0i2W1qah2gqo1_500.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 214px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gxn4SY9FRGw/T0af5IrvP9I/AAAAAAAAB_I/E9YXjGb2kEA/s320/tumblr_lthsgy0i2W1qah2gqo1_500.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5712428981298347986" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Tomorrow Never Knows&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet to my mind, the recording of an album appears to be a largely intimate process. After all, only few were privy to the goings-on of those small sound-proof rooms in North London, New York City and Gothenburg. We can only get so close to understanding the creative process of another person. That understanding seems to be diminished especially when it touches upon the creation of something that we hold in considerably high esteem. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I am alone in my failure to imagine the creative process. The truth is that I love these recordings to such a great extent that it floors me to imagine rehearsals, arguments or lyric sheets. Perhaps it is a foolish admission, but for me, it is as if these songs are so perfect that I cannot even imagine them being conceived. Perhaps if I could imagine it, I could believe and maybe even anticipate that potential that exists in us all: the potential to create something meaningful and significant to a great many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inasmuch as I fear the prospect of growing weary of these terribly important recordings, I cannot help but think that the only way to answer this conundrum is to commit to that one album and start writing. I can only hope that whatever propaganda, knowledge or damage that may result will be worth it, and that my words may be strong, truthful and effective enough to faithfully honour these silly songs which tend to mean so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Indiepop Podcast #40&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stills - Changes are No Good (Grand National Remix)&lt;br /&gt;Eugene McGuinness - Lion&lt;br /&gt;Jay Reatard - In the Dark&lt;br /&gt;Ra Ra Riot - Oh, La&lt;br /&gt;Alpine - Villages&lt;br /&gt;Real Estate - It's Real&lt;br /&gt;Sea Wolf - Black Dirt&lt;br /&gt;Sean Lennon - Would I Be the One?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Indiepop%20Podcast%20%2340.mp3"&gt;Download (44.7 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-4994031645994271728?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/4994031645994271728/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=4994031645994271728' title='7 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4994031645994271728'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4994031645994271728'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2012/02/it-was-brought-to-my-attention-that.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gxn4SY9FRGw/T0af5IrvP9I/AAAAAAAAB_I/E9YXjGb2kEA/s72-c/tumblr_lthsgy0i2W1qah2gqo1_500.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>7</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-4733245428302332431</id><published>2012-02-11T12:00:00.003+11:00</published><updated>2012-02-11T12:51:00.035+11:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Covers'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='The Smiths'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Musical Criticism'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Italo Disco'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='New Order'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>It was my kind friend, Adam of &lt;a href="http://pretendinglifeislikeasong.wordpress.com/"&gt;Pretending Life is Like a Song&lt;/a&gt; who suggested the proposition: "There's an argument that The Smiths' best song is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIg22ibTbeQ"&gt;Back to the Old House&lt;/a&gt; on Hatful of Hollow (1984) and their worst song is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiFzKNmeeSw"&gt;Back to the Old House&lt;/a&gt; on Louder than Bombs (1987)." I was more than willing to agree with him: Hatful of Hollow &gt; Louder than Bombs. There is something remarkable about that acoustic interpretation, the resonance of Johnny's guitar, Morrissey's breathtaking vocal delivery, I'm sure many others would agree. Yet, it surprises me to admit that, because I heard the version on Louder than Bombs first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6EWXT1P7ALs/TzUuYiTRXkI/AAAAAAAAB-s/sg3OzVna45E/s1600/distortion.jpe"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 188px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6EWXT1P7ALs/TzUuYiTRXkI/AAAAAAAAB-s/sg3OzVna45E/s200/distortion.jpe" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5707519101821345346" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;You never knew how much I really liked you, because I never even told you - oh, but I meant to.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The realisation made me reflect upon that unspoken tendency to prefer the first version of a song we hear. The "first version" manages to become the more definitive interpretation with every repeated listening. This may occur even though the "first version" may, in actuality, be the more illegitimate. It may be a cover, demo or in the case of New Order's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed7dMj76CHU"&gt;Brutal&lt;/a&gt; (2000), unduly sped up and distorted to shit. Familiarity with the "first version" may result in a difficulty to accept the qualities of another version. We come up with irrational pronouncements, like  &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChEhZOFO2rQ"&gt;Mito&lt;/a&gt;'s epic Italo anthem Droid (1982) cannot begin to compare with its cover by &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-rAEtxs5tQ&amp;feature=related"&gt;Hypnosis&lt;/a&gt; (1987): the cover is that much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A part of me thinks that musical familiarity has much to do with the subconscious. So often, I find myself inexplicably drawn to specific Italo tracks, only to discover I had heard them years before, included in &lt;a href="http://zyron.c64.org/mixinfo.php?mixid=12&amp;t=classic-italo-disco-mix-1"&gt;DJ Zyron's Classic Italo Mix&lt;/a&gt;. I recognised Catcall's track, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1li2V_4oEc"&gt;Swimming Pool&lt;/a&gt; (2010) during her support performance of CSS, not because I had heard the song on the radio, but because my sweet friend Louise of &lt;a href="http://nightclothesandheadphones.blogspot.com/"&gt;Eton Mess Life&lt;/a&gt; sang it in passing, well over a year before. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that there exists this subconscious desire to find a version, a "first version" in an attempt to obsessively revisit and ferociously defend. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, it is somehow more vindicating to discover a "second version" which far surpasses the first. It obliterates the comfort that comes from musical familiarity, however conscious. Such a discovery suggests that there continues to be a process of engagement, a process of assessing a song on its merits. Sure, it may never be possible to emulate the dizzying high: that initial moment where an interpretation becomes the first and absolute definitive. But, in spite of all attachments, it may be possible to fall in love with a song, over and over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Italo Disco Podcast #39&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big Ben Tribe - Tarzan Loves the Summer Nights&lt;br /&gt;Michael Bedford - More Than a Kiss&lt;br /&gt;Hysterical Fit - Come and Make Me High&lt;br /&gt;Albert One - For Your Love (Another Version)&lt;br /&gt;Buzzer - Complications (Moar Cowbell Mix)&lt;br /&gt;Hot Cold - I Can Hear Your Voice&lt;br /&gt;Mozzart - Malice and Vice&lt;br /&gt;Ken Heaven - The Calling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Italo%20Disco%20Podcast%20%2339.mp3"&gt;Download (64.9MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-4733245428302332431?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/4733245428302332431/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=4733245428302332431' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4733245428302332431'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4733245428302332431'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2012/01/it-was-my-kind-friend-adam-of.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6EWXT1P7ALs/TzUuYiTRXkI/AAAAAAAAB-s/sg3OzVna45E/s72-c/distortion.jpe' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-2734650883018652712</id><published>2012-01-31T15:24:00.005+11:00</published><updated>2012-01-31T17:31:34.587+11:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Folk'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Violin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Baroque Pop'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Melancholy'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Motivation'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>I always wondered how she knew: "You haven't practiced this week..." It was never an accusation, as such. It was a statement of an undisclosed truth. Perhaps it was apparent that I struggled with unfamiliar fingering or else the passage sounded weak and uncertain. Perhaps it was both, I could never be sure. I only knew of the embarrassment I felt when I disappointed my violin teacher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started violin lessons with her when I was seven years old. I remember watching her walk down the front path before my first lesson. I had absolutely no understanding of what was to follow. I wish I had known, in the same way I wish I could have been a child prodigy, a three year old, naturally inclined to bang out Beethoven on the piano. But alas, it was never to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still think of those early days with great affection. I was particularly fond of the rounded corn pad that was affixed to my bow, to ensure my right pinky finger was curved and in place. I also liked the yellow dots, splayed across the fingerboard in a seemingly random pattern. I struggled with some things. I was overjoyed when, after so much practice, I actually managed to pluck a string with my left pinky finger. Years later, I was dismayed to discover that this was a completely redundant skill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure anyone who's been there knows there is too much to recall: Gussie G-String and Dora D-String, scales, arpeggios, double stops and harmonics. It would be the greatest thrill for her to affix a silver star at the top of the page, next to the title. It would be the greatest compliment for her to pencil a line across a tick, making a cross, indicating that I had mastered the piece and it was time to move on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was this definite sense of progression, being introduced to third position and trying to wobble my wrist in a feeble attempt to do vibrato. She'd cry out: "You're doing arm vibrato! That's so much harder to do than wrist vibrato!" I would later struggle with vibrato as a teenage violinist. As contemporaries could produce a heartfelt wobble on cue, I could only ever tense up and move my finger quickly in a small, uneven shake. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn't help but feel guilty, as my teacher continued to investigate all different types of exercises and methods to help with my "vibrato problem". In all my years of playing, all my concerts, recitals, exams and lessons, I never managed to cure that glitch. Perhaps I never practised enough, perhaps my heart just wasn't in it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I must have loved it, didn't I? I did, I'm sure I must have. As I glean these recollections, I can't help but wish that my feelings were more resolute. That I absolutely loved everything associated with playing this instrument, that I was naturally inclined to play it and I was obsessed with it, as I am obsessed with analysing popular music. Everything could be conveniently sincere: the adoration  of both instrument and teacher would be unequivocal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I convince myself that it was all to satisfy the whims of others, I think of &lt;a href="http://imslp.org/wiki/Chanson_de_Nuit_and_Chanson_de_Matin,_Op.15_(Elgar,_Edward)"&gt;Edward Elgar's Chanson de Nuit&lt;/a&gt;. It changed everything somehow, my phrasing, my tone, even my vibrato appeared to be more convincing. It took on the guise of being dark and isolated, much like the freedom and the loneliness that comes from staying up all night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002710914/"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YinjGYTJJv8/TyeIv3sEtLI/AAAAAAAAB98/syVY8UNeuOQ/s1600/09526r.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 237px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YinjGYTJJv8/TyeIv3sEtLI/AAAAAAAAB98/syVY8UNeuOQ/s320/09526r.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5703677809072059570" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She insisted that everything came together with Chanson de Nuit, she declared that it was "my song". I had always hoped one song, any song would take on that dimension for me. I could never decipher the nature of my motivation to play, just as I could never determine the veracity of my affection for the instrument.

I can't quite understand why I feel this way, after all, musicians, like artists, are sensitive folk. Surely if their music is unfairly assessed, if their performances are unduly slated or their business decisions duly dissed, surely the musician has a right of rebuttal. Yes? Maybe? I don't think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I refer to a time when there was scant information available online about Bloc Party. Of course, there was the stylish and minimal official site which reflected the artwork of their first EP. Typically enough, there were also angry music snobs saying unkind things about the band on &lt;a href="http://drownedinsound.com/"&gt;Drowned in Sound&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be the first instance where I'd witness a band member defending their music. The bassist addressed the indifferent, he implored them to &lt;i&gt;just give them a chance&lt;/i&gt;. I thought it a rather desperate move to make, but then as a fan and rather naive music listener, I harboured a belief that the music should be assessed on its own merits. Should it really have to come down to begging?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reminded of this instance when it was brought to my attention that &lt;a href="http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/30683/Tim-Rogers-responds-to-bizarre-Townsville-review"&gt;Tim Rogers replied to a rather unfavourable live review in the Townsville Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;. The complaints were unsurprising: bad sound, sloppy stage show, the needless heckling and the jeers, "I'll be the one your girlfriend is thinking about later tonight!".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although eloquent, Tim's response seemed pointless and self-satisfied. He assures the writer, Amanda Gray: "I need to make it clear to you my writing has nothing at all to do with whether you think our band is rubbish or that I am a complete tool." He goes on to defend his banter, to explain that his sexual bravado is something of an in-joke, that he finds bad language to be so "bewilderingly exciting".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flecked throughout is his gratitude to be a professional musician, to have toured the world for twenty-two years, "with this humble self-satisfaction intact". Yet, all this carefully drafted posturing makes me wonder why, if Tim Rogers &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; so successful and self-assured, why does he feel compelled to even read the reviews of some small town paper? More to the point, what does he get out of addressing the grievances of this one unimpressed critic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that it is difficult to accept that universality: not everybody is going to like you. I suppose the point I am trying to make here is that you cannot convince someone to like you by obliterating them in an essay about how good you are. Tim, may I suggest that you take solace in the support of those who do appreciate your music and stagecraft. Although the lengthy rebuttals may amuse some, they ultimately come across as needy and insecure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Mod Podcast #37&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kinks - All Day and All of the Night&lt;br /&gt;The Drums - Book of Stories&lt;br /&gt;The Pipettes - Because It's Not Love (But It's Still a Feeling)&lt;br /&gt;Francoise Hardy - Il est tout pour moi&lt;br /&gt;Gerry and the Pacemakers - It's Gonna Be Alright&lt;br /&gt;The Beatles - All I've Got to Do&lt;br /&gt;Wishful Thinking - Step By Step&lt;br /&gt;The Jam - Happy Together&lt;br /&gt;INXS - Wishy Washy&lt;br /&gt;The Chords - Maybe Tomorrow&lt;br /&gt;The Monochrome Set - Monochrome Set&lt;br /&gt;The Coctails - Whoopsy Daisy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Mod%20Podcast%20%2337.mp3"&gt;Download (50.7MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-2482469426466575562?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/2482469426466575562/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=2482469426466575562' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/2482469426466575562'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/2482469426466575562'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2012/01/i-find-it-strange-when-musician.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><thr:total>4</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-9064472354258531712</id><published>2011-11-27T21:20:00.005+11:00</published><updated>2011-12-07T06:53:29.973+11:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Dance'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='1990s'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>I had lived with the frustration of not knowing the artist name or the song title. I had lived with the annoying possibility of not ever knowing. More often than not, such feelings attached themselves to anonymous reggae-pop dance hits of the early-to-mid 1990s. They were never particularly good songs, as such, but they contained a memorable quality which compelled me to seek them out. They sometimes featured on home-made mix tapes, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5EqiCaD7lE"&gt;dubbed from the radio&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, they lived on subconsciously, as thumping drum beats or &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6LhWbQthAI&amp;ob=av2n"&gt;neverending sustained notes&lt;/a&gt;. I only recently realised that I managed to conquer that impossible task: I had discovered the artist name and song title of every lost song, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a grand and thoroughly challenging task, requiring hours of painstaking research online. It was sometimes stupidly impossible, having to google and regoogle lyrics which had no semblance of originality: &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IiLZ0dvDWU"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh yeah, baby&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, the song title would feature a spelling mistake, à la &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Malcolm-McLaren-Presents-Worlds-Famous-Supreme-Team-Show-The-Operaa-House/master/68660"&gt;Malcolm McLaren's Operaa House&lt;/a&gt;, or the song title would be entirely omitted from the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8cy5Xn42Ymo"&gt;lyrics altogether&lt;/a&gt;. There could be any number of reasons why these songs became lost. The fact is, we all have lost songs. Songs that haunt and taunt us, that compel us to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smmtzejfpZ8"&gt;sing to confused friends in Maths&lt;/a&gt;, in the hopes we might one day achieve that moment of clarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thought it would be this way forever, as we would so frequently ask each other, "what was that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sPUpKGI1Z4"&gt;videoclip&lt;/a&gt; where Stalin's face morphed into Thatcher's?" But as time went on and as more people contributed videos, lyrics, questions and answers online, the number of lost songs we were looking for diminished dramatically. Not only that, the application Shazam provided a hassle-free, almost instantaneous service to identify lost songs. Upon discovering my last lost song, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBcX5SErQ-g"&gt;Marcella Detroit's I Believe&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed that there weren't more to be found. Inasmuch as it is intensely satisfying to be able to identify lost pop, there is nothing more exciting than knowing there is more left to be found. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qCT03nyKHeU/TtIhetv5uuI/AAAAAAAAB8I/D6h_CNl2Np0/s1600/snap2.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 198px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qCT03nyKHeU/TtIhetv5uuI/AAAAAAAAB8I/D6h_CNl2Np0/s320/snap2.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5679638891627920098" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Early 90s Dance Podcast #36&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technotronic - Pump up the Jam&lt;br /&gt;Milli Vanilli - Ma Baker&lt;br /&gt;Snap!  - Rhythm is a Dancer&lt;br /&gt;KLF - Justified and Ancient (Stand by the Jams)&lt;br /&gt;Jon Secada - Just Another Day&lt;br /&gt;Janet Jackson - Love Will Never Do (Without You)&lt;br /&gt;Elisa Fiorillo - On The Way Up&lt;br /&gt;The Shamen - Ebeneezer Goode (Beat Edit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Early%2090s%20Dance%20Podcast%20%2336.mp3"&gt;Download (57.9 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-9064472354258531712?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/9064472354258531712/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=9064472354258531712' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/9064472354258531712'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/9064472354258531712'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2011/11/i-had-lived-with-frustration-of-not.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qCT03nyKHeU/TtIhetv5uuI/AAAAAAAAB8I/D6h_CNl2Np0/s72-c/snap2.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-2308220175775080104</id><published>2011-10-10T17:14:00.005+11:00</published><updated>2011-10-11T00:19:04.891+11:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Britpop'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Subcultures'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Authenticity'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Indiepop'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>"You wouldn't believe this conversation I had with this dude tonight. He was trying to convince me that the Kooks were &lt;i&gt;more indie&lt;/i&gt; than the Arctic Monkeys." As soon as he said it, I couldn't help but pull an expression of bemused disgust. It was a baffling thing to consider, the prospect of an actual &lt;i&gt;scale of indieness&lt;/i&gt; where some artists rank higher than others. The worst part of it was that I felt compelled to construct a counter-argument, citing the significance of dancingmonkey.com in the early promotion of the Arctic Monkeys. It was a site with white background and black text, featuring a list of links to MP3 demos. It appealed to the idea that &lt;i&gt;the music could speak for itself&lt;/i&gt; and the incredible interest generated was achieved independently of record company interference. The Kooks would later post their demos onto Megaupload in early 2006, yet irrespective of the charm of &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttMYHoCIb_Y"&gt;Lonely Cat&lt;/a&gt;, the distribution of their demos could hardly be described as a significant landmark in the history of indie music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I regained my composure, I asked him how the actual argument unfolded. What became apparent was this person had a completely different idea of what indie meant. Once, the term indie was short for independent, encompassing groups without an affiliation with a record company (or else, groups with an affiliation with an independent record company). However, for this person, the term &lt;i&gt;indie&lt;/i&gt; simply meant &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt;. For me, it seemed wildly inaccurate to associate such a loaded term with a single word (and a superlative at that). But then again, I had to consider that for many, the term &lt;i&gt;indie&lt;/i&gt; is synonymous with &lt;i&gt;credibility&lt;/i&gt;. It is suggestive of being a lone independent artist, creating in retaliation of commercial appeal. The discernible fan, too, is required to maintain a certain degree of credibility. Cultural commentators such as &lt;a href="http://www.pitchfork.com"&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.flavorwire.com"&gt;Flavorwire&lt;/a&gt; establish their own credibility by dissecting the term ruthlessly and bemoaning the idea that &lt;a href="http://flavorwire.com/211210/the-10-things-that-are-killing-indie-music-in-2011/10"&gt;fashion, cynicism and laziness are killing indie music in 2011&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are times when a faithful adherence to indie culture can go terribly wrong. The infamous viral video of &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/switch/them/amy.shtml"&gt;"I'm Amy and I'm an Indie", from BBC Switch's Are You One of Them?&lt;/a&gt; is cringeworthy, to say the least. She comes across as suffering a complete lack of discernment: although she would obsessively adhere to every code associated with indie culture, she would do so without any real understanding of its significance. She would still manage to make some blunders, indulging in music in direct conflict with the indie credos, namely Razorlight and &lt;i&gt;ahem&lt;/i&gt;, Ronan Keating. Although she is a rather innocuous 17 year old girl, it is embarrassing to watch her identifying the silly customs of a highly pretentious and highly protective subculture. It is embarrassing to watch her, because her heightened awareness of every nuance of the subculture reveals how indie kids assimilate, silently and without question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zQ6InZGdCUw/TpLoRJxAE9I/AAAAAAAAB7Y/Bj9yYirgY1o/s1600/REP.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px; height: 188px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zQ6InZGdCUw/TpLoRJxAE9I/AAAAAAAAB7Y/Bj9yYirgY1o/s320/REP.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5661843062935000018" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From time to time, I arrest my desire to examine the meaning and currency of this feckless term.

Yet it seems no matter how many songs I listen to, there appears to be tens of thousands of songs to go. It is easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer number of songs produced in this musical era, inasmuch as it is easy to be confused as to why this genre has never been properly analysed or adequately documented. If you spend enough time with it, it's possible to garner an impression of the most significant dancefloor anthems, but much of the my personal enjoyment of this genre is predicated on taste. The act of actually listening to the songs, far removed from its original context, and finding that moment of perfect resonance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For others, it is the act of collecting Italo records which is the most enjoyable thing. For any noob, detecting what is obscure in a genre full of obscurities is somewhat problematic. However, the knowledgeable Italo collector never seems to have any difficulty in that respect. I've known of their plight for a long time, the risks they take in pursuing vinyl obscurities. In their pursuit of the &lt;i&gt;Holy Grail of Italo Records&lt;/i&gt;, the collector would sometimes part with hundreds of dollars in the hope that the record would arrive safe and intact in their letter box. However, the seller's account would duly disappear, along with the collector's money and any hope that the record ever existed in the first place. &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;How I felt for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bb9nS9mEciQ/TmoFYOyyMrI/AAAAAAAAB7Q/vbn0wDWTPmw/s1600/DSCF2304.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 303px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bb9nS9mEciQ/TmoFYOyyMrI/AAAAAAAAB7Q/vbn0wDWTPmw/s320/DSCF2304.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5650334596335809202" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://brittneycampagnaart.blogspot.com/"&gt;50 Works Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My search for perfect Italo had largely taken form in MP3 format, so I never had to deal with unscrupulous dealers. However, as my obsession with these songs dramatically increased, I considered how cool it would be to have &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Dharma-Plastic-Doll/master/5970"&gt;Dharma's Plastic Doll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Alexander-Robotnick-Probl%C3%A8mes-DAmour/master/14966"&gt;Alexander Robotnick's Problèmes D'Amour &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href="http://www.discogs.com/Jimmy-Susy-Come-Back/release/235393"&gt;Jimmy &amp; Susy's Come Back&lt;/a&gt;. No doubt my desire for these records coincided with my longing to hold a club night for the masses, where we would all dance to such songs (imagine, Rose's clip for &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjiJua6AAXs"&gt;Magic Carillion&lt;/a&gt;). Yet, still cautious and wary of the many horror stories of experienced Italo collectors, I only ever opted to click on the very cheapest records available. I didn't wish to be another casualty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ashamedly, my collection shows few signs that I've become so entrenched in this genre. There's a shamefully small handful of records; a Michael Bedford 7", a Den Harrow 7", a Laserdance 12", a Tom Hooker 12", a Fuzz Dance compilation, a ZYX boxset purchased from Stockholm. I still look on Discogs, not only to shop, but to research. For in a genre so free of narrative, it offers much insight into what is rare and valuable. When I have come across one of those records, &lt;i&gt;1 for sale from €800&lt;/i&gt;, I feel compelled to stake out that song and listen carefully. I attempt to assess its musical value and whether it correlates with market forces. It is a great relief to find the song is average at best and any chance of completely surrendering my bank account to this obsession can be laid to rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I present to you a podcast that will convert your bedroom into a darkened discotheque from the back alleys of Genova, circa 1986. I hope there, free of any external influence (ahem, aside from my own), you can fall in love with the sound of Italo and its unique pop immediacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Italo Disco Podcast #34&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clio - Eyes&lt;br /&gt;Mania - Shine Shine Shine&lt;br /&gt;Mister Black - Monnalisa&lt;br /&gt;Scotch - Pictures&lt;br /&gt;93rd Superbowl - Forever and a Day&lt;br /&gt;Joy Peters - Don't Loose Your Heart Tonight&lt;br /&gt;Swan - Don't Talk About It&lt;br /&gt;Ross - Coming Up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Italo%20Disco%20Podcast%20%2334.mp3"&gt;Download (70.3 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-8618993408037465196?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/8618993408037465196/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=8618993408037465196' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/8618993408037465196'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/8618993408037465196'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2011/09/ive-been-getting-swept-up-in-italo.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bb9nS9mEciQ/TmoFYOyyMrI/AAAAAAAAB7Q/vbn0wDWTPmw/s72-c/DSCF2304.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-7684872563267562738</id><published>2011-08-02T20:02:00.005+10:00</published><updated>2011-09-30T05:24:28.668+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Yé Yé'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mods'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>The 1960s Yé Yé movement was a beautiful thing, with its gentle pop overtones, delicate orchestral arrangements and Parisian pretensions. The idea of &lt;i&gt;Frenchness&lt;/i&gt; has since become so central to the Yé Yé sensibility, at least to its listeners who do not speak French. The greatest irony is that Yé Yé was initially perceived to be a parody of Anglo-American rock'n'roll. First coined by sociologist Edgar Morin in 1963, the term Yé Yé was seen to imitate the rock'n'roll catch-cry, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoF-7VMMihA"&gt;"yeah yeah yeah!"&lt;/a&gt;. The outsider influence can be observed in the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYr9EFJkh-o"&gt;astounding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcFyIBlsCC4"&gt;number &lt;/a&gt;of &lt;a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?mzg0n9kpyxc"&gt;French-language&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lo52G_MX6RY"&gt;covers &lt;/a&gt;produced throughout the Yé Yé era. It was as such that the singer Stella openly criticised the French obsession with American music. In an interview with &lt;a href="http://www.chachacharming.com/article.php?id=23&amp;pg=1"&gt;Cha Cha Charming&lt;/a&gt;, she attested that the biggest casualty of the American rock'n'roll invasion was French music: "all traces of France's musical history had vanished once American pop influences infiltrated France". Yet, this purported lack of cultural patriotism seems lost on the modern day, English-speaking listener. Now that everything seems to be shrouded in an Anglo-American pop influence, that which is unique about Yé Yé is contained within the very sound of the French language. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gOBMqPNm4Qg/Tjf-YCv2WQI/AAAAAAAAB6U/aHg8k-2PDow/s1600/tumblr_l7olmlyibV1qah2gqo1_500.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 290px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gOBMqPNm4Qg/Tjf-YCv2WQI/AAAAAAAAB6U/aHg8k-2PDow/s320/tumblr_l7olmlyibV1qah2gqo1_500.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5636253147685345538" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps Yé Yé carries a greater appeal to those who do not understand French. A few recognisable words may float past, &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;l'amour&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;le garçon&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;pourquooooi?&lt;/span&gt; However, the English-speaking listener develops an impression through the music itself, in its key, tempo, mood and delivery. If the listener is curious enough, they may be compelled to search and translate. If the listener is lucky enough, the lyrics (ou les paroles) may contain a poetic beauty, detectable in both French and English. France Gall's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73DHsJrfe1w"&gt;Faut-il que je t'aime&lt;/a&gt; (1966) contains one such moment: "C'était lui que je quittais mais c'était toi qui me manquais"; meaning, "It was him that I was leaving but it was you that I missed". At times, the song may completely lose its lyrical potency in translation. Such a discovery may lead you to believe that it was better to listen in ignorance, to learn and sing the song, happily, proudly and off by heart, not unlike a French poetry competition at school. Perhaps then, and only then, may you be at liberty to burst into song on L'Avenue de Gobelins and startle strangers with your bombastic rendition of Patricia Carli's &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsJnj-xKBOg"&gt;Le Lion&lt;/a&gt; (1967). But I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always, I will now leave you with this week's podcast. I ask you to reflect upon what it is to have a musical impression, to have an understanding of a song that is thoroughly your own invention. Is it possible to create "meaning" from a song, without knowing what the lyrics are about? Is it possible to appreciate words that rhyme, in a language you don't understand? Moreover, is it ever possible to detach pop from the ideology of nationalism?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Yé Yé Podcast #33&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stone - Le Jour, La Nuit&lt;br /&gt;Delphine - A Bientôt Sans Doute&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Carli - Le Lion&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline Taieb - La Fac de Lettres&lt;br /&gt;Denise Brousseau - N'écoute Pas Les Idoles&lt;br /&gt;Jany L - Herald Tribune&lt;br /&gt;Petula Clark - L'Agent Secret&lt;br /&gt;France Gall - Bébé Requin&lt;br /&gt;Valerie Sarn - Quand Je&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday Weld - Are you the boy&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Holloway - Tu N'es Pas Venu&lt;br /&gt;Les Fléchettes - Je Vends du Rêve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Yeye%20Podcast%20%2333.mp3"&gt;Download (43.6 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-7684872563267562738?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/7684872563267562738/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=7684872563267562738' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/7684872563267562738'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/7684872563267562738'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2011/08/1960s-ye-ye-movement-was-beautiful.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gOBMqPNm4Qg/Tjf-YCv2WQI/AAAAAAAAB6U/aHg8k-2PDow/s72-c/tumblr_l7olmlyibV1qah2gqo1_500.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-6715147219349519636</id><published>2011-07-11T03:46:00.006+10:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:10:59.015+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mods'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Icehouse'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Live'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Australia'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>If ever there was a pithy demonstration of what it is to be musically devoted, then surely waiting for hours in a non-moving queue would be just that. I'm well-acquainted with the pointlessness of such a venture, for only 24 hours ago, I stood outside St Kilda's Esplanade Hotel for an hour and a half in the hopes of seeing Icehouse perform live. The bouncer shouted at the queue, stretching back towards Victoria Street: "There's no chance any of you will be getting in tonight! It's full! The band are just about to start! Go home!" But in spite of his warnings, few punters relented. Andrew smirked at me, "I don't believe a thing that guy says."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth of it is that I can hardly claim the title of the world's most ardent Icehouse fan. My enthusiasm for their music derives from an attachment I have to a mythical 1980s Australia that only seems to exist on the old VHS tapes stored in our downstairs room. Icehouse also remind me of the brother(s) who influenced me immeasurably, who duly culled the Triple M canon and introduced me to Australian Crawl, Hunters &amp; Collectors, Crowded House and INXS. I was grateful to Andrew for that reason and so I was prepared to stand for as long as he was prepared to stand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew that my passion (and indeed, my knowledge) for the group would be tested by the devoted few who stood around us, shivering. Queue-mate Simon boasted that he managed to see Boom Crash Opera and Icehouse at the Venue, only a few metres down the street, some twenty-five years before. I offered a non-descript anecdote about how &lt;i&gt;Hey Little Girl&lt;/i&gt; was recorded in fragments and was largely constructed in post-production. Andrew, however, managed to serve up an in-depth account of Icehouse's then-synthesizer of choice, the Prophet-5. His account impressed the queue-mates surrounding us and as a result, it managed to secure our rightful place within the queue, among the cold and fanatical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There would be moments, in between the boasting and complaints where we would look at the Victorian bay window above us. We could only see blue and pink lights flicker across a roomful of silhouettes. Occasionally a member of the audience would turn to survey the queue below. It was hard to tell whether he was curious or sympathetic, we could not sustain his interest long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would all listen closely, "Hey, isn't that &lt;i&gt;Walls&lt;/i&gt;?", one of us would say. We would bow our heads in concentration, tentatively singing along with the band and with each other. These moments would not last long though, the noise band in the bandroom downstairs would start up again just as we were getting into it. We weren't angry or upset or even that frustrated, really. We were actually kind of elated to be standing together in such a way. I don't ever wish to forget a queue-mate's story of how, in spite of her enthusiasm for Icehouse, she accidentally kept on singing Mental As Anything songs as she primed herself for the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approaching the front of the queue was perhaps the most irritating part of the whole venture. I stood there as quietly and patiently as I could manage it. I was forced to survey a steady stream of people walk out that venue, down those steps and out onto the street. There was no semblance of a "one-in, one-out" policy, indeed the bouncer seemed intent upon completely ignoring me. I looked back at the queue earnestly and I then realised that their entry became dependent upon my entry. Perhaps if I exploited something, a charm or a physical attribute, I could get in, we could all get in. Perhaps then, I could save my left hand from frost bite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was at 12.30am when the bouncer finally gave up. Still refusing to meet my gaze, he requested my driver's licence. Once permitted, we bound up the steps to hear the last half of &lt;i&gt;Nothing Too Serious&lt;/i&gt;, their last song. You had to stand on tippy-toes to make out Iva Davies against a backdrop of LED lights. As the crowd bellowed for the band's return to the stage, our queue-mates chortled, "At least we got in!". Icehouse did come back to the stage, to play tight covers of the Easybeats' &lt;i&gt;Sorry&lt;/I&gt; and David Bowie's &lt;i&gt;Jean Genie&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the encore, queue-mate Simon insisted Icehouse would play &lt;i&gt;Don't Believe Anymore&lt;/i&gt;. With drunken enthusiasm, he said this over and over again, each time scrambling the name of the song. His mistakes triggered something within me, a part of me which demands that recollection of names, dates and releases be perfect and accurate. For a hasty and ironic moment, I quietly questioned &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; devotion to the band. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the lights came up, we said goodbye to our new queue-mates. We laughed and exchanged cards and nudged our way towards the door. As we poured out of the venue, down those steps, past the smokers and belligerent bouncers, I thought about that question of devotion and the tests and meanings which fans construct. I wondered whether the queue could ever accurately display devotion, knowledge or enthusiasm. After all, we can all stand in line. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dj7JAqQ458/ThoVuTzGN-I/AAAAAAAABq0/CXOceMEqMK8/s1600/theFansYouDontLiveHere.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 250px; height: 250px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dj7JAqQ458/ThoVuTzGN-I/AAAAAAAABq0/CXOceMEqMK8/s320/theFansYouDontLiveHere.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5627834569685612514" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Mod Podcast #32&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neon Hearts - Venus Eccentric!&lt;br /&gt;Graham Parker &amp; the Rumour - Stick to Me&lt;br /&gt;The Donkeys - Don't Go&lt;br /&gt;The Fans - You Don't Live Here&lt;br /&gt;The Spectors - In Your Room&lt;br /&gt;The Red Squares - All Over Town&lt;br /&gt;The VIPs - Boys of the City&lt;br /&gt;The Namelosers - Do-Ao&lt;br /&gt;Sound Sandwich - Apothecary Dream&lt;br /&gt;The Ramones - Do You Wanna Dance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Mod%20Podcast%20%2332.mp3"&gt;Download (45.7 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-6715147219349519636?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/6715147219349519636/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=6715147219349519636' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/6715147219349519636'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/6715147219349519636'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2011/07/if-ever-there-was-pithy-demonstration.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3Dj7JAqQ458/ThoVuTzGN-I/AAAAAAAABq0/CXOceMEqMK8/s72-c/theFansYouDontLiveHere.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-8863520145753769887</id><published>2011-05-02T03:09:00.006+10:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:12:05.774+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Britpop'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Semiotics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ratcat'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sexuality'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Feminism'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>I was randomly perusing &lt;a href="http://alsmusicrant.blogspot.com/"&gt;Al's Music Rant&lt;/a&gt; when I came across an article published in June 2009, &lt;a href="http://alsmusicrant.blogspot.com/2009/06/goodbye-female-audience.html"&gt;How To Lose Your Female Fanbase In 7 Easy Steps&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he apologised in advance for evaluating the physical appearance of a bunch of sexy musician-girls. The assessment could have been sexist, but he qualified the process by saying they were as attractive as they were talented. Such a qualification made me reflect upon my own wanton desire for a rather fetching, rather unstable &lt;a href="http://www.google.com.au/search?q=syd+barrett+mick+rock&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=JXe&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;prmd=ivnso&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Yci9TZOhFpGOvQPk3pHIBQ&amp;ved=0CCIQsAQ&amp;biw=1024&amp;bih=578"&gt;Syd Barrett&lt;/a&gt;. Mick Rock's portraits of the kohl-smeared Barrett haunt me still, but I would be the first to admit that I care little for his music. Silly, lustful, shallow ol' me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought of other musical crushes of yesteryear. John Lennon circa 1964, Freddie Mercury circa 1973, Morrissey circa 1986, Per Gessle circa 1991. It is perhaps odd to mention it, as I had &lt;a href="http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2008/05/there-are-moments-where-i-do-believe.html"&gt;once declared&lt;/a&gt; that my love of music was completely divorced from any notion of sexual attraction. At the time, I had been greatly influenced by Cheryl Cline's &lt;a href="http://books.google.com.au/books?id=10GznmSA3w4C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=rock+bitch+essays+that+bite&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H3qcygMuei&amp;sig=dORjYnL8WJoOnySz6HkSsunOf6o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cZi9TaDKFZGougPBsam7BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=rock%20bitch%20essays%20that%20bite&amp;f=false"&gt;Essays from Bitch: The Rock Newsletter With Bite&lt;/a&gt; and I was keen to evolve into a pseudo-secure pop-feminist who engaged with music on a purely cerebral level. That meant relinquishing the gushing, the fanfic and even the very idea of a pop image. It only followed that my obsession with faceless, anonymous mod-revivalist groups meant that my engagement was solely based upon the music itself (and not upon the physical appearance of any musician involved).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays, I am far more likely to acknowledge the prevalence of sexuality in pop. I audibly applaud the grotesque contortions of Shakira. I feel great unease about the gender roles represented in Jessie's J's Like a Dude. I admit genuine concern when I insist that Ke$ha really needs a shower. It is far cry from the rueful swooning and blood-thumping obsession of a 16 year old girl, but I am compelled to speak frankly of the most profound of musical crushes past. Perhaps it is because I now accept that doing so will not diminish the sincerity of my relationship with music. It will not undermine my authority to speak about it, neither will it reinforce a stereotype that women cannot connect as men can: (cue stock footage of Beatle fangirls at Shea Stadium) &lt;i&gt;they scream, cover their glowing cheeks, then faint...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8tbO2zxG8Bs/Tb28VIzOrHI/AAAAAAAAARk/DGrjq25imZA/s1600/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8tbO2zxG8Bs/Tb28VIzOrHI/AAAAAAAAARk/DGrjq25imZA/s320/0.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5601840582844394610" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Simon Day: Cautious&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I speak of the most profound of musical crushes past, I speak of the introductory moments of Ratcat's video for &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IAQPKds034"&gt;That Ain't Bad&lt;/a&gt;. At first, Simon Day's face is obscured by shiny black curls. When he tousles his loose curls from his face, it reveals a flawless, almost iridescent complexion. His cheek bones are sharp and his teeth are straight. I watch the clip again. He is too feminine to be masculine and yet too masculine to be feminine. Even as a 6 year old, I was mesmerised by his beauty. My attraction to him was only exacerbated by the arguably requited lyrics: "Ye-e-e-e-eah, I love you!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fascinating thing about That Ain't Bad is that Simon plays the role of the lovelorn. All his friends have warned him not to be with her, after all, she has a bad reputation. Unfortunately, Simon cannot heed to such warnings because he cannot see why she is so "bad". However, the imagery of the video would suggest that Simon is actually a "bad-boy" himself. He dons a leather jacket, manhandles a sizable tomato-soup-coloured Gretsch guitar and climbs through a wire fence with his mates in a dodgy part of town. Following this, I find it a little hard to believe that Simon would ever feel so vulnerable as to protect his heart from a callous femme fatale. Come to think of it, Simon is exactly the kind of boy our friends would warn us about... and much like Simon, I would duly ignore their every word of warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is perhaps ironic that the most significant live recording of That Ain't Bad features not Simon singing, but a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeRAQUvs-Jw"&gt;crowd of hysterical teenage girls&lt;/a&gt; singing over him at Melbourne's Metro. It makes absolute sense when they sing these words, you can hear them smile and shriek and carry on. You cannot help but smile too when you hear their yelps: &lt;i&gt;OH MY GOD! OH MY GOD!&lt;/i&gt; There is something wonderful about it. To me, it acts as an implicit pledge, en masse, to abandon all sense of caution, to ignore all sensible advice, to lust in vain. I long for a feeling like that again. I long to shriek mindlessly without qualm or qualification, along with a song and a man I really, really loved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Britpop Podcast #31&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mclusky - To Hell With Good Intentions&lt;br /&gt;LR Rockets - Renee Loves Losers&lt;br /&gt;Carl Barat - Je Regrette, Je Regrette&lt;br /&gt;The Good, The Bad and The Queen - History Song&lt;br /&gt;The La's - Liberty Ship&lt;br /&gt;Tim Tin Yen - Girl Number One&lt;br /&gt;The Divine Comedy - The Pop Singer's Fear of the Pollen Count&lt;br /&gt;Frankie &amp; Heartstrings - Hunger&lt;br /&gt;The Holloways - Reinvent Myself&lt;br /&gt;The Vaccines - Wreckin Bar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Britpop%20Podcast%20%2331.mp3"&gt;Download (45.2 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-8863520145753769887?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/8863520145753769887/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=8863520145753769887' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/8863520145753769887'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/8863520145753769887'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2011/05/i-was-randomly-perusing-als-music-rant.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-8tbO2zxG8Bs/Tb28VIzOrHI/AAAAAAAAARk/DGrjq25imZA/s72-c/0.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-4280445655687264698</id><published>2011-03-07T16:56:00.013+11:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:12:34.079+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Subcultures'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Italo Disco'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>It was one curious afternoon, months before I cancelled my gym membership. I was half-heartedly ambling on a treadmill, listening to &lt;a href="http://www.artrocker.tv/radio/"&gt;Paul Artrocker's radio show&lt;/a&gt; on my then-intact iRiver. I had made the habit of listening to Artrocker in places that were completely incongruent with the &lt;a href="http://www.artrocker.tv/"&gt;Artrocker&lt;/a&gt; credos. This music was clearly intended for the emaciated cool kids of Camden. I had visions of them in their dimly-lit squats, hungover and hungry, sniffling and sitting on green milk crates. I wanted a place to sniffle and sit with my own fold of Camden cool kids. Instead, I could only listen to songs and details of their antics, as I ambled alone with an alarmingly high heart rate, half a world away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite aside from my desire for a milk crate, Paul Artrocker happened to indirectly touch upon a frustration which I felt so keenly, one that was so relevant to my own isolated listening practices. Paul was to report of all the goings-on for the week in London. He was to detail all the gigs, instore appearances, club nights and related musical antics, but alas there was nothing to report. Nothing was going on in London town. As he appealed to the good listeners of &lt;a href="http://resonancefm.com/"&gt;Resonance FM&lt;/a&gt; to email with their forthcoming events, I couldn't help but detect that hint of dissatisfaction in his tone. It made me wonder whether it was even possible that my favourite city could be completely bereft of musical activity. Perhaps Paul had grown weary and disenchanted with the scene? It made me wonder: &lt;i&gt;what can we possibly do when we think we're over it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EoDtD7bq42g/TXUZ0O9T3NI/AAAAAAAAAPA/FGCAK_-CwDE/s1600/jimmy_susy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 305px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EoDtD7bq42g/TXUZ0O9T3NI/AAAAAAAAAPA/FGCAK_-CwDE/s320/jimmy_susy.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5581395698354740434" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prospect of &lt;i&gt;getting over&lt;/i&gt; music is commonly brought up by those who don't really care about anything. Occasionally the words &lt;i&gt;getting over&lt;/i&gt; would be replaced with the words &lt;i&gt;growing out of&lt;/i&gt;, almost to suggest that engagement with pop culture has something to do with being a hormonal adolescent. It is a fearful and offensive prospect, to imagine that something so central to our existence is merely a phase. After all, to those who really care about music, it dictates who we spend our time with, how we spend our time and how we spend our money. Perhaps even more obviously, it is a sign of heartfelt allegiance. It is an indication that we identify with a gang who shares our tastes and ideals. We can wear badges on our blazers, indicating that we're a mod or a punk or even an artrocker. We can protest that this allegiance will be forever, but there is a part of us that can never truthfully guarantee it will always be this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I admit now, as I have admitted on previous articles on C&amp;CM that there have been genres I have grown weary of. There have been times where I have lost my direction and focus. I can see now that my loss of passion had nothing to do with the scene, as such, but my unwillingness to further explore the recommendations of others. I know, particularly from the construction this week's Italo Disco podcast, that a scene need not have local gigs or club nights. It may be a scene that could be accurately described as "extinct", but even still, the mere act of discovering undiscovered music can be one that is so exciting and so thoroughly stimulating. The prospect of discovering the undiscovered is one that we should hold onto, tightly and to our chests, when we ask that question: &lt;i&gt;what can we possibly do when we think we're over it?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Italo Disco Podcast #30&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B.W.H. - Livin' Up&lt;br /&gt;Hugh Bullen - Alisand&lt;br /&gt;Barry Leitch - Lotus Turbo Challenge II&lt;br /&gt;Grant Miller - California Train&lt;br /&gt;Jimmy &amp; Susy - Come Back&lt;br /&gt;Savage - A Love Again&lt;br /&gt;Rose - Magic Carillon&lt;br /&gt;Esavu - Sia Siou (Breaking Up)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Italo%20Disco%20Podcast%20%2330.mp3"&gt;Download (61.2 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-4280445655687264698?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/4280445655687264698/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=4280445655687264698' title='6 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4280445655687264698'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4280445655687264698'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2011/03/it-was-one-curious-afternoon-months.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EoDtD7bq42g/TXUZ0O9T3NI/AAAAAAAAAPA/FGCAK_-CwDE/s72-c/jimmy_susy.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>6</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-2825885453102406928</id><published>2011-02-23T22:14:00.007+11:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:13:02.350+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vintage'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Electro'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Melancholy'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Collection'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>It was fitting that I was in a vintage clothes shop when the thought crossed my mind. It was a wry thought, an admittedly sarcastic thought about old things: If only people were slightly more sentimental, every home would be a vintage clothes shop. All this naff peculiar stuff wouldn't be so strange and expensive. It would be stockpiled in your cupboard, waiting, free, along with all your other weird miscellaneous tat. Only then the vintage clothes shops of this town wouldn't have a monopoly upon your thoroughly unique postmodern aesthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone coming to our house for the first time would be overwhelmed by the amount of "stuff" we have. Shelves and shelves of books and records, VHS tapes and DVDs, computers and antiquated appliances. Our interests vary from opera scores to Amigas, guitars to Petit Tom books, violins to cassettes, girls annuals and blazers. We collect, compare, research and rejoice whenever one of us would make a stifling discovery. But, whatever the artifact, no matter how precious, it always seems to be relegated to our pile of "stuff".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a tremendous desire to store and access the past. Our love of memory tends to manifest itself in different ways. Andrew likes to organise his photos on Picasa while I record every passing thought and memory in any number of half-empty notebooks. There is a kind of grim sentimentality attached to such behaviour, a kind of sickly unease that we don't tend to share. Perhaps I am the only one who feels it, that no one can ever really value the past, at least, not as it ought to be valued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29311242@N06/2737572671/"&gt;&lt;img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3042/2737572671_b660e4a4bf_m.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Picpus est inquiet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There have been times where I have seen a duplicate object, often in passing in a vintage emporium on Smith St or else a science museum in Oxford: &lt;i&gt;It's our bread bin! It's our slide rule!&lt;/i&gt; But even behind glass, it all seems so worthless when stripped from its context. If you could even call context "a drawer full of crap". Yet it is that decontextualisation which makes these objects so romantic to others. It is weird and unique and consequently, obscenely expensive. I feel uncomfortable with the newfound value of these objects, my objects, any objects. No one should unduly profiteer from our attachment to "stuff". It is a cruel thing to prey upon, our desire to share, laugh and collect the things we love. What makes it even more cruel is that all stuff is really quite useless. We really don't need anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Electro Podcast #29&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keane - Spiralling&lt;br /&gt;Annuals - LOXTEP&lt;br /&gt;Reverend &amp; The Makers - Sundown on the Empire&lt;br /&gt;Music for Animals - If Looks Could Kill&lt;br /&gt;The Virgins - Teen Lovers&lt;br /&gt;Games - Strawberry Skies (feat.

For one thing, I am a little cynical of the whole Christmas venture and I find it all so embarrassingly irrelevant, especially come latterday reflection. But I admit that I enjoy the private rituals that tend to accompany this time of year. Listening to Queen's Live Killers and Ace of Base's Happy Nation (US Version), maybe sometimes even The Bridge. Reading Enid Blyton's Five Go To Smuggler's Top and fragments of Roman poetry from the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sweetness-Honey-Sting-Bees-Mediterranean/dp/1556706804/sr=1-1/qid=1164042707/ref=sr_1_1/103-3240365-8666260?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"&gt;Sweetness of Honey and the Sting of Bees&lt;/a&gt;. Every year I unintentionally take up new habits. Last year, for instance, I was obsessively listening to Yeasayer's Tightrope. The year before, we listened to Aqua's Candyman in my car. You emphatically insisted you didn't like it, even though it became increasingly apparent that you did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose it's a time that calls for tradition and for me, at least, a recreation of events passed. Yet at the same time, there demands a certain degree of reflection. A contemplation of the songs that meant something to us during the year. Hence the heady influx of 2010 lists, summaries, countdowns and other things that involve dotpoints, numbers and paragraphs with few words. It used to &lt;a href="http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2008/12/cassettes-chocolate-milk-mod-podcast-11.html"&gt;annoy me&lt;/a&gt; considerably. The compilation of lists and summaries is not my idea of sentimentality, but I understand it. I see how it offers a really neat way to view that which has passed. It is an easy way to sort and compartmentalise everything within an inch of its life. I also understand how that act of musical list-making is, in itself, a kind of tradition. In the same way that I return to my 1954 edition of Smugglers Top.

Growing up as a musical obsessive, I indulged in my passion for collecting such things. There was some satisfaction in developing an understanding of a group's live stage show: the costumes, lighting rig and stage set up, the setlists (and its occasionally odd inclusions) and the gig itself. Many of those shows were remarkable and simply by name-dropping the venue, city and the year, it was possible to conjure up all those references. You could insist that the London's Earls Court 1977 show had the most impressive setlist or the Osaka's Kosei Nenkin Kaikan 1976 afternoon show had the most electrifying atmosphere. I would gladly agree with you, adding that I would have done anything to be at the London's Rainbow Theatre in 1974.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I was attracted to bootlegs because I so desperately wanted to be there. I wanted to be pushed up against the railing, breathless with friends and fans alike. I always seemed to suffer with an eternal frustration that I had missed it all. My annoyance was further exacerbated by the fact that my father was in the UK for every year of the 1970s, with exception to 1978. He had the opportunity to attend such events, to be squished and suffocated in the many musical haunts of my phantom heyday, but he did not care for pop music. Operas from the mid-1830s were more his bag. So I had to be satisfied with these recordings and those momentary discussions with friends who felt the same way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story doesn't end there, oddly enough. I had the opportunity to rectify my annoyance. I had the chance to attend a gig that I never thought would happen, in a place I never thought I'd be. The idea of seeing Roxette perform live had become a complete impossibility to me. Marie had been so unwell and Per said that they would never collaborate again. I remember what disappointment I felt, reading their Wiki. But I would continue to listen to my collection of their early T&amp;A demos, typically after band practice. I was fascinated with the way Per would structure his songs. I would think about his lyricism and how frequently his heart would be run over by a runaway train. I would compel my friends to listen too, frequently commissioning covers of (I Could Never) Give You Up and I Do Believe. We would always laugh about it, but I loved it, all the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TQoE0XF4rcI/AAAAAAAAAN0/uqC840OM4ns/s1600/8799.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TQoE0XF4rcI/AAAAAAAAAN0/uqC840OM4ns/s320/8799.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5551254788285967810" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A crowd, awaiting Roxette in &lt;a href="http://forum.runtoroxette.com/live_in_skanderborg_smukfest_08082010-t6391.0.html"&gt;Skanderborg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would keep up to date by reading the &lt;a href="http://www.dailyroxette.com/"&gt;Daily Roxette&lt;/a&gt;. There would be a slight murmur of activity and I would typically feel extremely resentful that I could not in be Stockholm to witness Roxette related events. Perhaps the worst thing was when Per performed in London to promote his Party Crasher album. Going to London is a reasonably viable thing for an Australian to do, after all, it has become a national pass time to haunt the hostels of Paddington. It was additionally painful because I was actually quite fond of that album, not in a way that I would bully my friends to record covers from it, but it was really very, very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The activity of the Daily Roxette seemed to increase. Progressively, they started to report news that Marie and Per were talking again. They had performed for the Prince and Princess of Sweden. They were rehearsing for a tour. &lt;i&gt;A TOUR??&lt;/I&gt; Surely not! It had been nine years since Per and Marie had embarked upon such a venture, surely it was not possible. It was a coincidence that their four tour dates miraculously coincided with my brother Andrew and I being in Europe. I remember sitting in his room, discussing the prospect of going to Sundsvall or Anderstorp. How could we possibly get to the north of Sweden? How could we find accommodation when the two hostels and four hotels that served the town appeared to be completely booked out? My other brother Tomy said it could not be possible, but Andrew was determined that we make it happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan was this: we would board a Ryan Air flight from Brussells Charleroi to Stockholm Skavsta, where would would board a Flygbussarna bus that would take us to Stockholm Central Station. From there, we would board a sleeper train, where we would doze on beds suspended ten feet in the air and disembark at Sundsvall at approximately 4am. Dizzy from glee and exhaustion, we would roll our bags across town and up a mountain to our hotel, which by-the-by greatly resembled Monash Clayton. Upon our 8am arrival, we would watch the Nanny, nap and generally recoup in anticipation for Roxette, where we would have to take a bus to Norrporten Arena. I remember playing Look Sharp! loudly before we left, but it was too surreal to even contemplate what was about to go down. I knew I had to bootleg the show, for it was the only way I could be sure that it ever really happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TQoJKCu3QwI/AAAAAAAAAN8/z9hOJiP6-Cw/s1600/DSC02338.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TQoJKCu3QwI/AAAAAAAAAN8/z9hOJiP6-Cw/s320/DSC02338.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5551259558824329986" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Roxette in Sundsvall, El-Cam&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the largest chunk of my travel diary attempting to describe every detail of that performance. How we shrieked upon the introductory chords of Joyride, how we swooned upon hearing Silver Blue, how we sang with Per and Marie. Loudly. In real time. I described the crowd, the moderately raucous South American fans causing a scene down the front and the bleach-blonde bitches who would push in by grinding up against unsuspecting men. I recalled about how we made friends with the people around us, a family, a couple, the two brothers. I told them how Tomy saw Per a number of years ago, it was his first ever gig. He was so incredibly proud to even be in attendance, but then his pride faltered when he realised his high-school chums were Per's support act. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smile when I think of seeing Roxette live. It was a surreal experience, a truly perfect evening. I have to explain to those who hear the story that I did not go &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; to see Roxette, there were other things too. European things. Interlaken, record shops and the Pet Shop Boys. The unfortunate irony of it is that as much as I loved that experience, I know that I could never appreciate it as I would a 1974 bootleg. Perhaps that is something do with my feelings of possibility and impossibility, reality and the nature of imagination. Could anything be as great as a temporal impossibility? I can never really be sure. I will never know if the gig could have taken on that mythical dimension, as I will never know the effect of hearing my bootleg of that night. I lost the show, without ever hearing it, when I dropped my iRiver on a hard-tiled floor in Rome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Swedish Pop Podcast #27&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mando Diao - Gloria&lt;br /&gt;Lykke Li - Get Some&lt;br /&gt;Hell on Wheels - The Soda&lt;br /&gt;Corduroy Utd - Little Elvis&lt;br /&gt;Hardy Nilsson - Hela Hjärtat Mitt&lt;br /&gt;Roxette - Fingertips (MTV Unplugged)&lt;br /&gt;Ace of Base - Lucky Love (Acoustic Version)&lt;br /&gt;Acid House King - Are We Lovers or Are We Friends?&lt;br /&gt;The Legends - He Knows the Sun&lt;br /&gt;The Tough Alliance - Silly Crimes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Swedish%20Pop%20Podcast%20%2327.mp3"&gt;Download (51 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-4479142198529064861?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/4479142198529064861/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=4479142198529064861' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4479142198529064861'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4479142198529064861'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2010/12/i-havent-forgotten-purpose-or-effect-of.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TQoE0XF4rcI/AAAAAAAAAN0/uqC840OM4ns/s72-c/8799.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-7954597253668787382</id><published>2010-12-09T13:22:00.009+11:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:15:24.632+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Britpop'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Indiepop'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>I have always taken great pride in remaining on good terms with my musical past. On some level, I know that I act in cultural retaliation. I do not like it when people diss the bands they used to like, in the same way that I do not like it when people chastise themselves for their poor decision-making ability. Personal and musical empathy is important, which is why I encourage everyone to keep a diary. It's harder to diss tastes and motivations when it's penned with Winston Churchill's pen, with purple ink: 1994-2010.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention this because I haven't been getting on well with one aspect of my musical past, Britpop. It may seem a baffling revelation, given everything I've just said, but I have been feeling uneasy about it for a while. For all the genres I do like, there is nothing as contentious, nothing as contextually provocative as Britpop. To produce podcasts on the subject introduces so many questions of clarification and classification. What was once a rolling field for discovery has since become a place where we argue about the purported breadth of the genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I understand that if I am to be a purveyor of decent music, I should present it in a way that is true and accurate. Slapping the descriptor "Britpop" on a product generally suggests that said product should contain moderate chunks of actual Britpop. Blur. Oasis. Supergrass. Pulp. Elastica. There is that implicit freedom of showcasing lesser known Britpop artists. Salad. Gene. Menswe@r and the like, but it all seems so insipid to me. Why should I feel compelled to put you through that? Simply because they reveled in the latter-day popularity of the coveted Britpop tag?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TQBI5GuqAyI/AAAAAAAAANc/ueo6L0mtqoI/s1600/DSC01208.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TQBI5GuqAyI/AAAAAAAAANc/ueo6L0mtqoI/s320/DSC01208.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5548514886816498466" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rough Trade West&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prospect of finding a song that fits into the narrow definition of Britpop has put me off constructing that kind of podcast altogether. Perhaps it is the prospect of getting told off by those who know more than me. Perhaps I have grown tired of the genre. In truth, I certainly hope I don't really mean that. It was the genre we once swooned over. We analysed it endlessly and we understood it to encompass far more than that handful of bands in the mid-90s. We saw the tag as descriptive, not prescriptive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not really bothered to make any more Britpop podcasts, not for a little while yet anyway. I'm sorry if this disappoints listeners, but I am not so inclined to promote that what everybody seems to know about already. Neither I am so inclined to include token obscurities to fit the bill. In its place, I will produce a broader, "Indiepop" podcast which will obviously betray my Britpop tendencies but also contain memorable pop from other locales and eras. I do so in a cursory acknowledgement of that thankfully unexplored argument of "what is indie?".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope I will restore my relationship with Britpop in time, only because it is important to remain on good terms with it. I don't wish to be so caught up in the definitional issues of the genre anymore, just as I don't wish for it to be a platform to assert cultural superiority. That's not how we should listen to music. For all of the misdefinitions, misrepresentations and misunderstandings, all I ever wanted to do was share good music with you. I'm sorry if it caused offense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Indiepop Podcast #26&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingeborg Selnes - Open Your Heart&lt;br /&gt;The Drums - Let's Go Surfing&lt;br /&gt;Indochine - Miss Paramount&lt;br /&gt;Mason Proper - A Chance Encounter&lt;br /&gt;This is Ivy League - London Bridges&lt;br /&gt;Malajube - Montréal -40C&lt;br /&gt;The Chills - So Long&lt;br /&gt;Cut Copy - Take Me Over&lt;br /&gt;The Bird &amp; The Bee - Man&lt;br /&gt;Gyllene Tider - Det är över Nu&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Indiepop%20Podcast%20%2326.mp3"&gt;Download (49.9 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-7954597253668787382?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/7954597253668787382/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=7954597253668787382' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/7954597253668787382'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/7954597253668787382'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2010/12/i-have-always-taken-great-pride-in.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TQBI5GuqAyI/AAAAAAAAANc/ueo6L0mtqoI/s72-c/DSC01208.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-4739829664947485575</id><published>2010-12-02T18:25:00.007+11:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:16:17.093+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Electro'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Synthpop'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>Recently, I was invited to express an opinion about "guilty pleasures". I had to chortle at the prospect of doing so, after all, I had evaluated my understanding of trashy pop music years ago. I had made a short, almost &lt;a href="http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2007/06/i-thought-that-there-was-no-better.html"&gt;momentary&lt;/a&gt; radio documentary on the topic. It yielded a neverending parade of friends describing how alienated they felt by their taste. It was through talking to so many people about guilty pleasures that I realised that the shame originated from a number of sources: an acknowledgement that the music is tacky, meaningless and disposable; identifying a violently flamboyant visual aesthetic or else realising that the music conflicts with your outward persona. I also read somewhere that a guilty pleasure shows that you actually "know" about music... and there's nothing more embarrassing than knowing about music, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't even realise that my views on such things had changed. As Mini pasted &lt;a href="http://www.accessallareas.net.au/blogs/EkllpVyVyAFdaxfVno.php"&gt;slabs&lt;/a&gt; of text to me, describing his love for Michelle Branch and Delta Goodrem, I noticed that he defended his passion in such a careful and sensitive way. It made me realise that guilty pleasures are simply not relevant to me anymore. I said to him, "Perhaps every thing I like is a guilty pleasure?" It is true to some extent, my cultural choices may be dismissed and ridiculed by the stealthy guardsmen of good taste. They don't even have to say anything, whoever &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are. I understand what is fashionable, what is indie and credible, as opposed to what is trashy, silly and ridiculous. I was once told that there would be a time when I would not care what &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; thought. I was once promised that I would be comfortable and honest enough to celebrate what I love without fear of reproach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how did it come to be like this? I believe much of it has to do with the construction of the online identity. It is possible to conceal those things that make you uncool. You do not need to feature Milli Vanilli in your list of Favourite Artists on Facebook, you do not need to incessantly mention Ace of Base on Twitter. Instead, you can associate yourself with a kind of wispy, bearded indiepop subgenre that has considerably more gravitas and far greater kudos than Space Disco. I can't identify when it happened exactly, but somewhere between that momentary whiff of a documentary and this very day, I learned to embrace and project all that I would otherwise be ashamed of. Irrespective of any glitchy sound or cheesy attitude, I think it is the greatest thing to find that song that resonates with you. It's not fair to celebrate that discovery in isolation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given up defending the music I love because I no longer take the cultural guardsman seriously. He is like an insecure hipster to me, running from one token endorsement to another. He once held such conviction in his taste, but since it has fallen out of favour with a key indie stakeholder, he feels compelled to snarl, dismiss and ridicule. He is desperate to assert his own cultural superiority, but when he does, it is almost as if he is dismissing a fragment of his musical past, a part of himself that found a rare affinity in something as beautiful and ephemeral as pop music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is stupid. We should never be ashamed of our taste. We should learn to trust our cultural sensibilities. Cool or otherwise, we should celebrate in rejoice in the discovery of truly great pop.

I made a mistake on C&amp;CM Mod Podcast #1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TO5UVskd6ZI/AAAAAAAAAM8/Se2APfYY3sg/s1600/birrr4.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 243px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TO5UVskd6ZI/AAAAAAAAAM8/Se2APfYY3sg/s320/birrr4.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5543460923057760658" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was only by reading the &lt;a href="http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com/2010/08/were-from-bradford.html"&gt;Wool City Rocker&lt;/a&gt; that I discovered my mistake. It was an accidental discovery, as I didn't think I would find anything of material relevance to C&amp;CM. Although occasionally alienating, I like reading of the mod revival antics of Bradford in the early 1980s. The Wool City Rocker is considerably more composed than any of my other zines. It was written in a fine hand and it carefully described and predicted the success of groups such as the Negatives, Terminal 3, Middle 8 and other groups you've never heard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is to be contrasted with other zines, &lt;a href="http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com/2010/07/sniffin-glue-and-other-rock-n-roll.html"&gt;Sniffin' Glue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://si-site-nogsy.blogspot.com/search?q=intensive+care"&gt;Intensive Care&lt;/a&gt; and the like, which refer to many of the well-trodden traditional punk songs typically associated with the movement. There are photocopied bits of photocopied photocopies, jagged lines and thick capital letters, akin to that very keen, DIY punk aesthetic. The rants have a real, detectable voice, a growl perhaps and an aggression you can never really take seriously. They gruffly declare who is in and who is out: "The Stranglers are not included in our list!!!!!" They are to be loved, for the nuances of personal taste are so often ignored in the latter-day documentation of punk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, as an outsider, there are moments when you don't quite get the musical references. It happens particularly in mod revivalist zines which focus upon the more local, esoteric groups who never produced anything more than a home-made demo in 1979. It is frustrating, as I want to know of all the releases of the Negatives, Terminal 3 and the other one. I suppose it serves to demonstrate the fragmented nature of scene. It makes me wonder if every street had their own little mod revival band. Like a group of dapper town priors with Rickenbacker guitars, tight suits, thin ties and glowing-white socks. You could only imagine such a phenomenon with such reviews as, "they’re practically as good as the Chords!" or "they’re nearly as good as the Jam!". I could imagine those excitable kids reading those reviews. "A locally-produced, fat-free alternative to our musical heroes? Right here in Hull? Surely not!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must assure you that no musical reference is ever truly lost. The education is swift and stimulating, thanks to a veritable smorgasbord of mod sites: &lt;a href="http://punkmodpop.free.fr/index.htm"&gt;the ModPopPunk Archives&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://musicruinedmylife.blogspot.com/"&gt;Music Ruined My Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://lowdownkids.blogspot.com/"&gt;Low Down Kids&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://shortsharpkickintheteeth.blogspot.com/"&gt;Short Sharp Kick in the Teeth&lt;/a&gt; and other sites I adore but fail to mention. From there, singles can be downloaded, lineups can be obtained. All the data is there to be accessed and I use that word carefully, &lt;i&gt;data&lt;/i&gt;. Yet, we are so often left to ask one another, how can we find Colin Swan and Geno Buckmaster? How can I be sure that XL, who wrote the World to Me is the same Excel that wrote Summer of '42? Who the hell were the Mystery Guests? For these questions, we must turn to the frantic, flaming and occasionally shambolic zines of March 1980. For without the zines, we cannot understand the songs and without the songs, none of this would be worth our time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ohes. And that mistake I made? The City Limits had nothing to do with the Squares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Mod Podcast #24&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virgnie Rodin - Commando Spatial&lt;br /&gt;Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti - Bright Lit Blue Skies&lt;br /&gt;Gents - Honor Bright&lt;br /&gt;Rotjoch - Ghostride&lt;br /&gt;Excel - Summer of '42&lt;br /&gt;Jacqueline Taieb - Le Coeur Au Bout Des Doigts&lt;br /&gt;Erick St Laurent - Le Temps D'y Penser&lt;br /&gt;REM - Carnival of Sorts (Box Cars)&lt;br /&gt;Backdoor Men - Out of My Mind&lt;br /&gt;The Heartbeats - Funny Anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Mod%20Podcast%20%2324.mp3"&gt;Download (39.4 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-5677067368291930383?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/5677067368291930383/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=5677067368291930383' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/5677067368291930383'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/5677067368291930383'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2010/11/i-made-most-horrific-discovery-only.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TO5UVskd6ZI/AAAAAAAAAM8/Se2APfYY3sg/s72-c/birrr4.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-4153031464602889319</id><published>2010-10-24T10:50:00.008+11:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:17:22.530+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Baroque Pop'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>We were sitting in a train, somewhere between Antwerp and Bruges. Perhaps it was even Bruges and Brussels, I can't even be sure. It was an unlikely situation. We sat on the fold down, dark blue vinyl chairs of the spacious baggage area. There wasn't any other place we could sit. I was thinking of important matters, namely Petit Tom and Baroque Pop. The paradox of Baroque Pop to be precise. I sat with the baby laptop on my knees and described the situation to my brother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"You see, Baroque Pop is a paradox, because it is the pairing up of two incongruent genres. Baroque should have nothing to do with Pop."&lt;br /&gt;My brother remained distracted, staring at the sleeping man sitting across from us.&lt;br /&gt;"OK."&lt;br /&gt;"It just doesn't make sense. I don't understand how it could have emerged, the blending of high culture and low culture. I mean, it clearly started in the mid sixties with the Left Banke, the Cake and the Kinks and so forth. It was obviously popularised by the harpsichord interlude of In My Life and who could forget Eleanor Rigby?"&lt;br /&gt;He remained blank.&lt;br /&gt;"Alright."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We remained silent for a few moments as I tried to develop something of a coherent argument.&lt;br /&gt;"There's something in the sound. There's something about the instrumentation of Baroque Pop which makes it seem as if pop music had some kind of historical basis in classical music, when it was simply never the case."&lt;br /&gt;He flinched his brow.&lt;br /&gt;"It wasn't?"&lt;br /&gt;I paused for a moment.&lt;br /&gt;"Well, pop obviously originated from rock n roll, but that had little to do with the classical tradition."&lt;br /&gt;"But some pop musicians can read music. Some." He trailed off. The man across from us slumped deeper in his chair. "I think the problem is that I don't know what you're talking about."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled out my then-functioning iRiver. It was happy and intact, well before I dropped it on a tiled floor in Rome. I pressed some buttons strategically and passed him his set of headphones.&lt;br /&gt;"Listen to this."&lt;br /&gt;We sat in silent concentration and listened to the Kinks' Village Green. I knew he would like it, after all we both dug the harpsichord sound and ideas of a lost England. After it finished, he handed the headphones back to me.&lt;br /&gt;"Maybe they used classical instruments because it just sounded nice."&lt;br /&gt;I looked back at the slumped man and curled my lip in resignation.&lt;br /&gt;"Maybe you're right."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TMN6ZW6i9rI/AAAAAAAAALM/nsC04PqFTpo/s1600/tumblr_l4064yx40b1qz4s3wo1_500.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 241px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TMN6ZW6i9rI/AAAAAAAAALM/nsC04PqFTpo/s320/tumblr_l4064yx40b1qz4s3wo1_500.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5531399343407560370" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Baroque Pop Podcast #23&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Morning Benders - Excuses&lt;br /&gt;The Kinks - Village Green&lt;br /&gt;Blur - Clover Over Dover&lt;br /&gt;Eddie Howell - Man from Manhattan&lt;br /&gt;Split Enz - My Mistake&lt;br /&gt;Jeremy Messersmith - Organ Donor&lt;br /&gt;Patrick Wolf - The Libertine&lt;br /&gt;The Magnetic Fields - I Don't Really Love You Anymore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Baroque%20Pop%20Podcast%20%2323.mp3"&gt;Download (28 MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-4153031464602889319?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/4153031464602889319/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=4153031464602889319' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4153031464602889319'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/4153031464602889319'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2010/10/we-were-sitting-in-train-somewhere.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/TMN6ZW6i9rI/AAAAAAAAALM/nsC04PqFTpo/s72-c/tumblr_l4064yx40b1qz4s3wo1_500.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-5962489577015832786</id><published>2010-05-08T03:52:00.014+10:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:17:56.504+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Britpop'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Post-Punk Revival'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Scenesters'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>There is something strange about realising that your culture doesn't seem to exist anymore. We can revisit the music and the places which once meant so much, but their potency has somehow diminished. Things are no longer as they were: we have grown up. We now listen to other music. There are moments of comfort though, when either you or I heave a great gust of retrospection. I so love it when you write to tell me how much you miss the &lt;i&gt;excitement&lt;/i&gt; of our time. The post-punk revival that happened all of five years ago. I sometimes imagine it's what being a first generation punk would have been like. The jagged guitar lines thrashing our back and sides. The hurtling drum beats governing our every movement. The rally cries we shouted in boisterous unity and wholehearted sincerity. When I think of it we are dancing, happy and lost in the depths of Fitzroy. If Fitzroy had any depths...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don't wish to think of how it came together or how it fell apart. The time exists as some kind of pretentious mirage. &lt;i&gt;O God&lt;/i&gt;, what it would be like to be a part of a gaggle of post-punk scenesters. &lt;i&gt;O God&lt;/i&gt;, what it would be like to anticipate the move and motive of every British musical publication. &lt;i&gt;O God&lt;/i&gt;, how it would be to undermine the rules and tacky guidelines ascribed by Mr Kingsmill and his suitably trendy honchos. We developed such an intense manner of assurance in our cultural sensibilities. We knew we were onto something, so we desperately campaigned for their popularity in any way we could. Slightly flushed, we discussed whatever tenuous links we had with members of the band. Slightly flustered, we emphatically insisted that we &lt;i&gt;discovered them&lt;/i&gt; months before anyone else. We savoured that bittersweet irony: we so wanted them to be popular, but we would come to resent them in the very attainment of that popularity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's so easy to see it when we stand so far away. I understand why that music meant as much as it did. Even though the music possessed an unspeakably rare breed of pop charisma, its consequence was not contained within the music itself. It was the &lt;i&gt;sharing of the music&lt;/i&gt; which created this community, this sense of unified enthusiasm for the movement. It's difficult to remember the musical climate but all this happened at a time when there was no Myspace, no Facebook. There were no MP3 blogs. There were a &lt;a href="http://betterpropaganda.com/"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.epitonic.com/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://www.insound.com/mp3s.php"&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; which provided free new music downloads. It was an intensely frustrating time to find &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; song by &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; band... and you could forget walking into Polyester Records to ask for that EP because they wouldn't have a clue what you were talking about. Believe me, it really happened. It was inevitable we would have to find one another in a forum, there was no other way we could find this music alone. It was just too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recall going to extreme measures just to get a single song, ripping a streaming radio session or a live show online. I know that so many others had to resort to similar measures, simply due to the scarcity of resources at that time. This practice, however, is not discussed in light of its associated legal ramifications. Perhaps people are scared, perhaps people don't wish to acknowledge their downloading practices online. These are completely valid concerns. However, it is a terrible farce to deny these practices ever existed within the community. To ignore its prevalence would completely dismiss the love, dedication and &lt;i&gt;motivation&lt;/i&gt; of the devoted few. We would go to such lengths to share our passion and in turn, we had an unyielding desire to indulge each others' every recommendation. It is a shame, because I know it is this very aspect of the culture which will be forgotten in time: that intense desire to share and to explore &lt;i&gt;our&lt;/i&gt; music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My attached podcast explores many of the songs that, at one time, made our &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoJQquyCKQk"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt; dance. Let's not think of how it all fell apart. Let's not recall how the jagged guitars and hurtling drums became so tiresome. Let's not think of how easy it became to find the music we wanted. It's a cruel thing that the interwebs had to become as amazing as it did. No longer are we compelled to chase individual tracks so desperately, albums leaks are now available so readily. Sordo and What.CD made us so inconsequential to one another. We no longer needed each others recommendations. We are now so-called independent tastemakers, cruelly susceptible to the hype and tacky guidelines by Mr Kingsmill &amp; co. It fills me with a sense of utter complacency, really. I feel no desire to keep up with any of it, just because they insist I should. I'd rather retreat to 1982, where so many more things remain to be discovered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/S-SC9fxHWsI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/AIkehLiE08k/s1600/bp7.bmp"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 223px; height: 320px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/S-SC9fxHWsI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/AIkehLiE08k/s320/bp7.bmp" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5468639840545757890" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Don't trust art, don't trust culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cassettes &amp; Chocolate Milk: Britpop Podcast #22&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rakes - Terror (Extended Mix)&lt;br /&gt;Bloc Party - Staying Fat&lt;br /&gt;Franz Ferdinand - 40'&lt;br /&gt;Maximo Park - Once, A Glimpse&lt;br /&gt;The Futureheads - Meanwhile (Acoustic)&lt;br /&gt;The Cribs - Things Aren't Gonna Change&lt;br /&gt;Battle - Tendency&lt;br /&gt;The Cloud Room - Blackout!&lt;br /&gt;Radio 4 - Absolute Affirmation&lt;br /&gt;Lily Allen - Nan You're a Window Shopper (Demo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/17868629/C%26CM%20Britpop%20Podcast%20%2322.mp3"&gt;Download (52MB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/23062516-5962489577015832786?l=cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com' alt='' /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/feeds/5962489577015832786/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=23062516&amp;postID=5962489577015832786' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/5962489577015832786'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/23062516/posts/default/5962489577015832786'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://cassettesandchocolate.blogspot.com/2010/05/there-is-something-strange-about.html' title=''/><author><name>Eleanor</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/01059714155210664700</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v318/GOAT2G/ellyvision.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/S-SC9fxHWsI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/AIkehLiE08k/s72-c/bp7.bmp' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-23062516.post-4020850541476454239</id><published>2010-04-26T19:22:00.007+10:00</published><updated>2011-07-16T06:18:29.537+10:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Podcasts'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Italo Disco'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>Dear Italo Disco,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I been so totally besotted and bemused by a single genre. I scarcely know what to say when people ask what's going on between us, because the fact is that it's impossible to define what we have. It's not that I am ashamed of you... well, OK, yes, I am ashamed of you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don't be downhearted, I think you're still great. I still want to stay up until 3 o'clock in the morning, listening to Italo megamixes. But I just don't know what people will say when they find out the truth about us. I used to have some credibility endorsing jangly guitar music on the interwebs, but I seem to be endorsing more and more music of a dubious quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that fans have been talking about you behind your back. They say that your music is tacky and disposable. They say that your singers don't understand what they're singing about. They say that the entire thing was engineered by recording labels. It's not fair that they should treat you so bad, Italo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's still hope for you yet. There could be a revival, you gotta believe me. Pitchfork could write a hyperbolic endorsement and you could be ironically adored by scenesters the world over! Then I could get all aggressively and territorial and claim that I loved you first! El stylee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I don't want you to act out but I think it's best we don't see each other for a while. It's nothing personal, Italo, I've just sort of overdosed on you.

It is a reflex response whenever we encounter something unnecessarily depressing or melodramatic, dark or self-conscious. These are the dismissals of an outsider, based upon the impressions of a subculture that can be so easily characterised and lampooned. I do it myself, I admit. I secretly chortle at the misunderstood few, draped upon the steps of Flinders Street Station. I secretly bemoan the seemingly endless stream of emo tweets and status updates, desperately crying for sympathy. It is only in recent times that I realised how carelessly callous that insult is. Its broader connotation alarms me, because that insult somehow manages to dictate how we view, value and evaluate personal expression. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must clearly acknowledge now that I will never write a treatise in defense of emo music, simply because it is horrible. But I will forever defend the value of personal expression, whatever the ghastly sentiment. I know that many of us create in fear that we may be unnecessarily depressing, melodramatic, dark or self-conscious. I know, too, that so many of us have abandoned creative projects upon the very thought: &lt;i&gt;"This is too emo, this is too emo."&lt;/i&gt; What incredible work could have been produced if only we hadn't been discouraged by that invisible electrical fence. What if we could have seen the value in our own work and recognised its merit, quite simply because it is an unspeakably courageous thing to put our feelings into words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the prevalence of this insult suggests that we live in a time where it is simply not appropriate to be so personal, so painful, so &lt;i&gt;completely wretched&lt;/i&gt;. I suppose it makes sense, you could be doing something much more productive with your time, like reading a book or chasing a cat. But then again, I can't help but think that it reflects this embarrassed attitude we have towards depression among the community at large. I don't quite understand why, but it still seems to be something of a taboo subject. Incidents of melancholy are recounted in hushed mutterings and shameful retorts. &lt;i&gt;Nobody is meant to know about it, nobody else is meant to deal with it but you.&lt;/i&gt; It shouldn't be this way, it really shouldn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/S6epCIVD4NI/AAAAAAAAAJw/I0ZCK7Gtm9c/s1600-h/manray.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 246px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/S6epCIVD4NI/AAAAAAAAAJw/I0ZCK7Gtm9c/s320/manray.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5451511728015925458" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Man Ray makes emo beautiful&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I urge you, my loving peeps. The next time you dismiss someone as emo, think about the meaning behind that expression. Remember it takes an awful lot of courage to wear your misery like a stripey scarf.

It seems as if their geographical background is secondary only to the name of the group. Once you know that, then you have to know their lead singer's name, their recording label and the ultimate reason for their demise. It makes for a wildly comprehensive understanding of the places these people are singing about and how they interacted with other bands from the same place. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In saying all that, you can never really escape from something like Morrissey's Manchester. It's all so relevant and I wonder why. Is that sense of locality real, in that these singers make a very deliberate attempt to allude to these places? Strangeways Prison? Ancoats? Whalley Range? The Moors? Are their rural accents exaggerated and if so, for what purpose? What is the consequence of Paul Smith singing with a Geordie accent? Or else is the British musical press reinforcing this idea of &lt;i&gt;history&lt;/i&gt;, creating a messy, elaborate web of creative relationships, to be mythologised at length for decades to follow?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A part of it is just me, maybe. I like thinking about Freddie and Roger, queening it up on Kensington High Street, the Beatles performing upon the Apple rooftop or the Sex Pistols mucking about at the 100 Club. Maybe it makes it all the more real. If you know about the significance of these places then there is that very remote possibility of pilgrimage. There is that ultimate inevitability, of course, that once you get there, it will be just a street, it will be just a building. You will go to Wardour Street and there won't be "A" bomb there are at all. &lt;i&gt;There is nothing special there so why bother?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/S1NR1sMu9sI/AAAAAAAAAJo/KfW2v83FTCo/s1600-h/DSCF9365.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_zR6ukJBqIr4/S1NR1sMu9sI/AAAAAAAAAJo/KfW2v83FTCo/s320/DSCF9365.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5427771958751065794" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Beatles' Love, in Las Vegas of all places&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But there is something special, in some way. It's quite indecipherable. There is an idea that such pop songs, such perfect musical encounters took place in such ordinary places. Council houses, schools, night clubs or electronics shops in the case of the Pet Shop Boys. It is the ordinary nature of it that is so special and it may well touch upon that unspeakable, selfish hope that one day, the ordinary places you frequent could be filled with a similar kind of consequence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I leave you, my friendlings, with a related C&amp;CM Britpop Podcast.
