class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7838" title="Joe Farace Photography" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/CB5-333x500.jpg" alt="Joe Farace Photography" width="333" height="500" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">There is much more to black and white photography than simply an absence of color. Maybe I wouldn’t feel this way if the very first photographs had been made in color but that didn’t happen and, like many photographers, I grew up admiring the work of W. Eugene Smith and other black and white photojournalists who photographed people at work, play, or just being themselves. As a creative medium, traditionalists call it “monochrome” while digital imagers may prefer “gray scale,” but as Billy Joel sand “it’s still black and white to me.”</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Black and white is a wonderful media for making portraits because the lack of color immediately simplifies the image, causing you to focus on the real subject of the photograph instead of their clothing or the surroundings.  Sometimes the nature of the portrait subject demands that the image be photographed in black and white. Arnold Newman’s portrait of composer Igor Stravinsky could never have been made in color and have the same impact that is has as a monochrome image.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">There are also the trendy aspects associated with creating images in black and white. MTV, motion pictures and fashion magazines periodically “rediscover” black and white as a way to reproduce photographs that are different from what’s currently being shown. Right now, many professional photographers are telling me that they’re seeing a higher than normal demand for black and white portraits— even for weddings—than previously was the case. Individual and family portrait purchases like these are driven by these same trends.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Most SLRs that offer a monochrome option also usually offer color digital filter effects that mimics the effects created by on-camera filters and while you could use real color filters on your camera to archive the same effects,  there are major advantages of using digital filters. While most in-camera metering systems automatically take “filter factors” into consideration, you still have to look through and compose through a colored filter whose factor might range from three and five.  In addition, a purely digital solution is an easier one to live because the exposure for no filter is identical to one with the dark red filter.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><em>Tip: Filter Factor? Any light lost due to absorption depends on the type of filter being used in front of your lens and is expressed as a filter factor and is usually marked on the filter ring. A 2X factor means exposure must be increased by 1 stop, and 3X means one and one-half stops. When using several filters at the same time, filter factors aren’t added but are multiplied. Today’s camera metering systems automatically takes filter factors into consideration.</em></p><p

style="text-align: justify;">That&#8217;s right it&#8217;s now for sale in the eBook store!  After much hullabaloo and promise of getting this out sooner, I&#8217;ve finally crossed the T&#8217;s and dotted the I&#8217;s to the satisfaction of counsel and review teams, which means it&#8217;s ready for you!  So, what is the Prequel?  Well, as you may recall the DIY Legal Kit was a bundle of forms created by yours truly with a professional licensed copyright attorney &#8211; including such things as an event contract, a licensing form, model releases (adult and child).  It got a lot of positive feedback, with one minor (but important) note &#8211; there was no explanation of what each form was, and when to use them.  Enter the DIY Prequel!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7831" title="DIY Legal Prequel" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/cover02.png" alt="DIY Legal Prequel" width="500" height="500" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The DIY Legal Prequel not only addresses what each form is, but discusses the background of what the legal principles are that surround the entire realm of legal expectations in the photography world.  Everything from Copyright to Right to Privacy, Fair Use and more is covered in here.  It&#8217;s a pretty detailed discussion too &#8211; covering 12 pages of content.  It&#8217;s nicely broken up with questions, answers and short narratives surrounding each concept and is designed specifically with the photographer in mind!  Wanna know the best part?  You can get it for <strong>FREE!</strong></p><p

style="text-align: justify;">Yup, it is available for a limited time as a free eBook when you get the Legal DIY Kit along with it.  Just use the discount code <strong>DIYPREQUEL</strong> when you go to check out!  For those of you who may be thinking &#8220;Ok, but what if I don&#8217;t need (or already have) the DIY Legal Kit.  There&#8217;s a discount code for you too!  To save 20% off just the DIY Legal Prequel by itself, use discount code <strong>CBPREQUEL</strong>.</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">As if that&#8217;s not enough, I also went a little off the deep end (don&#8217;t ask me why), and decided to offer an incredible discount to anyone who might want to just get the entire collection of eBooks &#8211; with an <strong>ALLIN</strong> discount code to save 10% off everything!  The best part here?  You can use the<strong> DIYPREQUEL</strong> and the <strong>ALLIN</strong> discount codes in conjunction with each other, for some huge savings!  That includes the DIY Legal Prequel, the DIY Legal Kit, and 49 Tips, Volumes I and II!  Combining the discounts is pretty sweet too&#8230;$5 of the total, then 10% off the remainder all adds up to some substantial savings!  But ya gotta act fast &#8211; this is only good through Sunday, the 10th!</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">Photography projects are a great way to keep the creative juices flowing and to keep your skills active.  Just like anything else, if you don&#8217;t practice your photography regularly, things can get rusty, so avoid the atrophy with these fun summer projects:</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Summer Foods!</strong>  Some foods are very stereotypical of summers, including hotdogs, bratwurst, watermelons, and salads (chicken salad, macaroni salad, potato salad, etc.)  Heck, even beer at a baseball game can make for some photo ops!  Try to come up with excuses to make the foods and then let your creativity whirl when capturing the images!  The best part is when you&#8217;re done shooting, your appetite is easily whetted and gratified!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/baseballbeer.jpg" rel="lightbox[7795]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7796" title="Summer Food!" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/baseballbeer-500x333.jpg" alt="Summer Food!" width="500" height="333" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Summer Themes</strong>  Lots of fun themes surround summer &#8211; school letting out, graduation, independence, traveling, sunny beaches, fireworks, etc.  Pick a theme and look for ways to capture images of your own.  Obviously some will be more time sensitive (are you ready for July 4th fireworks?), so plan your timeline accordingly.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/fireworks.jpg" rel="lightbox[7795]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7797" title="Summer Fireworks" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/fireworks-500x500.jpg" alt="Summer Fireworks" width="500" height="500" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Summer Sunrises and Sunsets</strong> Yes, they are the intrepid photos we see all the time from all the world over, but every one is different, and every photo can tell a unique story, so stay out late one night or get up early one morning and find out where these classic shots can best be had in your area.  The nice thing about doing this during summer is that you don&#8217;t have to get up as early, and for the latter, you can usually wait until after dinner for your photo excursions &#8211; long days of summer give us extended times to approach the classic shots!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/sunrise.jpg" rel="lightbox[7795]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7803" title="Summer Sunrise" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/sunrise-500x234.jpg" alt="Summer Sunrise" width="500" height="234" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">This is just three ideas, of course, and you likely know where I&#8217;m going from here:  what ideas do you have for summer photo projects?  Share your own experiences and thoughts in the comments!</p><div

style="text-align: justify;">It&#8217;s kind of an unusual week here at the blog.  First off, I&#8217;ve been traveling all week.  First was a work trip, now a bit of personal time spent in upstate NY.  Combine that with the launch of the latest eBook from the folks at Craft and Vision (which I touted <a
title="Craft &amp; Vision - EyePhone" href="http://www.canonblogger.com/2012/05/23/mobile-phone-ography/" target="_blank">here</a> on the blog Wed., supplanting the regular &#8220;Wordless Wednesday&#8221;).  Now, having done all that, I am playing around with one of the secrets tipped off in said eBook &#8211; the photo app called Camera+.  It&#8217;s a cool little app and makes your pictures pop quite a bit over the standard camera app.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">I figured it&#8217;d be better to mention this now though over later, because apparently the price for the app is going to go up, and it can be had now for typical App Store rate of 99 cents!  Al Smith, author of EyePhoto, mentioned a few neat tricks to using the app and I am finding even more as I play around with it.  Here&#8217;s some sample shots I took with my mobile and processed straight through the app itself:</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Photo-May-22-7-06-05-AM.jpg" rel="lightbox[7782]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7783" title="Coffee Swirls" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Photo-May-22-7-06-05-AM-375x500.jpg" alt="Coffee Swirls" width="375" height="500" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: center;"><strong>Coffee Swirls</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">I took this shot at the hotel after downloading the app.  It was my first shot, and yes, was way over-processed, but I quickly figured out how to dial things in.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Photo-May-25-10-04-51-AM.jpg" rel="lightbox[7782]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7785" title="Floral Wall Decoration" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Photo-May-25-10-04-51-AM-375x500.jpg" alt="Floral Wall Decoration" width="375" height="500" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: center;"><strong>Floral Wall Decoration</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">With the strong shadows from the wall and the intricate detail of the floral piece, this kind of shot was made for dramatic processing, and Camera+ is ideal here for a dramatic shot on the go!  Processed using the Clarity option 2x in Camera+</p><p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Photo-May-25-10-36-56-AM.jpg" rel="lightbox[7782]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7786" title="Contemporary/Modern Chair" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Photo-May-25-10-36-56-AM-375x500.jpg" alt="Contemporary/Modern Chair" width="375" height="500" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: center;"><strong>Contemporary/Modern Chair</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">My folks got a new chair, and it just struck me as an interesting piece for the shape and angles.  Nothing extraordinary on the processing, except that I was able to add brightness to the seat area which was not in the original shot using the Shadow option.  (It&#8217;s a pretty comfy chair too!)</p><p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Photo-May-24-8-11-27-PM.jpg" rel="lightbox[7782]"><img

style="text-align: center;"><strong>Southern Tier Expressway</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;"> I used to drive this road before it was an Interstate back and forth between home and college, so became very familiar with the Southern Tier Expressway.  I&#8217;d seen a sign earlier, and had a bit of nostalgia, so promised myself if I happened to see another one and the light was decent enough, I&#8217;d pull over and try a shot using Camera+.  The sun just happened to be setting as I rounded a corner on the new &#8220;Interstate&#8221; and I saw this.  Processed using the Clarity button 2x  in Camera+.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">If you&#8217;ve not bought the eBook yet, it&#8217;s available over at <a
title="Craft &amp; Vision - EyePhone" href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=88199&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=97073" target="_blank">Craft and Vision</a> for only $4 through Sunday ($5 after that).  Make sure you use the discount code: <strong>EYEPHONE4</strong>.  Then, with the buck you saved on the eBook, hop over to the <a
title="Camera+ in iTunes" href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id329670577?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4" target="_blank">App Store</a> and get Camera+  I did and am totally geeked about mobile phone photography now!  Probably more mobile phone photography coming up this weekend too! <img

align="justify">Okay, I am breaking two of my own rules today.  The Wordless Wednesday one is the first that I am pulling out of order, primarily because time is limited on this news.  The other reason I am breaking the rules is because this actually knocked my socks off!</p><p><img
height="439" style="margin: 5px" width="918" alt="" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/eyePhone-CoverSpread-NEW2.png" /></p><p
align="justify"><a
href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=88199&#038;c=ib&#038;aff=97073" target="ejejcsingle">Craft And Vision</a> has released their latest eBook, called EyePhone!  Normally I am particular to David DuChemins line of writing, but this time Al Smith has surpassed even his standard because this eBook was just amazing.  I know this sounds gushing, but really&#8230;.no joke.</p><p><img
height="439" style="margin: 5px" width="918" alt="" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/eyePhone-Spread1.png" /></p><p
align="justify">So, remember when Chase Jarvis published &quot;The Best Camera&quot;?  It was a book extolling the virtues of using your iPhone (or mobile phone for Android fans) for photos&#8230;he shared photos and basically inspired you to just make sure you are out there taking photos with any camera &#8211; as long as you have one with you.  (Hence the title.)</p><p><img
height="439" style="margin: 5px" width="918" alt="" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/eyePhone-Spread2.png" /></p><p
align="justify">Well, Eyephone takes this to the next level.  Rather than just saying to take a camera with you, or even share photos extolling the virtues of doing so, Eyephone actually gives you explicit instructions on how to take and make better pics with your mobiel phone.  Everything from camera functions, to Apps to download, and little secrets that are what I would call the &quot;Insider Scoops&quot; of the mobile phone photography phenomenon.</p><p><img
height="439" style="margin: 5px" width="918" alt="" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/eyePhone-Spread3.png" /></p><p
align="justify">So, in typical fashion, the folks at Craft and Vision offer it at an amazing price of only $5 for nearly 50 pages of photo tips, tricks, and inspiration!  As if that&#8217;s not cheap enough for you, for a limited time you can save another buck through Saturday and get it for only $4!  Just use discount code EYEPHONE4 to get the deal.  Likewise, bundles are available too.  For instance, to save the same 20% on bundle deals, use EYEPHONE20 for bundles of 5+ eBooks.  Lastly, David&#8217;s own lines can be had for nearly 50% off the 7 book bundle &#8211; use discount code DAVID19 there to get the series for $19 (which is normally $35!).</p><p><img
height="439" style="margin: 5px" width="918" alt="" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/eyePhone-Spread4.png" /></p><p
align="justify">In case you missed the link upthread here&#8217;s another one (it goes to the same landing page)&#8230;  Go <a
href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?cl=88199&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=97073" target="ejejcsingle">here</a>, go quickly, learn, save, and then (of course), DO!  I did and already am taking better camera shots!</p><div

style="text-align: justify;">A little birdie had told me a while back that Walgreens is now offering very affordable ink refills for you at $13 per cartridge!  The nice thing I noticed is that they offer service on this while you wait &#8211; they simply inject new inks into your cartridges.  It almost seems too good to be true, and while I am hesitant to take the risk for my gallery prints coming off the Epson R1800, I am seriously considering taking it for a test drive with my everyday use printer &#8211; an HP Deskjet 1050.  Since it&#8217;s kind of photo-related, figured it&#8217;d be worth polling the readership to see if anyone else has taken the leap with this sort of offer!  Have you used any ink re-filling services?  If so &#8211; who have you used?  Were they adequate to your tasks?  What sort of printing did you expect from it?  Gallery prints or everyday use documents like email, boarding passes, etc.?  Would love to hear your comments, thoughts, feedback and ideas in the comments&#8230;</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/walgreens.png" rel="lightbox[7764]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7765" title="Walgreens Refills Inks!" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/walgreens-500x257.png" alt="Walgreens Refills Inks!" width="500" height="257" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">I&#8217;m seriously considering it when the alternative for the regular refill cartridge is $30 versus $13.  It&#8217;s over a 50% savings!  Something tells me to be cautious because something just doesn&#8217;t sound right.  An old saying I always use (and have had repeated to me is that &#8220;If something is too good to be true, it usually is&#8230;&#8221;  Since it&#8217;s only a $40 printer, the refill cost seems rather disproportionate to the cost of the printer, and I&#8217;d hate to throw away a printer simply because I was too chincy with the ink replacement needs&#8230;but this savings seems almost too good to pass up!  What say ye all?</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">As many of you know, I have been moving fast and furious since starting a new position as a Professional Trainer some nine months ago.  As we started ramping into the busy season, I announced that the schedule may have a trickle-down impact to the blog here, and the last few weeks have definitely seen that to be the case.  To wit, I announced, but have still not shipped the prize for the winners of the March contest (sorry Aimereen and Spike), much less made an announcement of the winner for the April contest, and now, the May contest schedule seems to be in jeopardy.  Unfortunately, the winds of change have sufficiently thrust me off the course of creating useful content here on the blog for some time now, and the can is empty yet again.  That&#8217;s right &#8211; I&#8217;ve got nuthin&#8217;!  Well, that&#8217;s not entirely true &#8211; I do have some news to share and a photo or two, so I&#8217;ll share the latter first and the former second.  With the latter, I was having some fun with a set of archives and noticed that this one looked particularly intriguing with two of several crops going at it.  I tried one, and think I like this the best!  How does it strike you?</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/playground.jpg" rel="lightbox[7743]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7749" title="Arvada Playground" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/playground-333x500.jpg" alt="Arvada Playground" width="333" height="500" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">I will ship the March prize out tomorrow (I promise!).  As for May, enough time has passed that running a contest for a mere two weeks (and change) would likely not give people sufficient time to submit images&#8230;so, call it author prerogative &#8211; I am making a slight adjustment to the contest schedule:  <strong>The May contest is now the Summer Contest!</strong>  I will take images from now until the end of June, and the lucky winner will get not one but two DVD&#8217;s of learning resources from yours truly &#8211; one from Ibarionex R Perello and one from Chris Orwig!  These are phenomenal DVD&#8217;s and the educational value alone is priceless.  Retail costs alone are easily in the $150+ range.  I am not sure what they run as the DVD&#8217;s were gifts to me from my good friend Joe Farace, fellow Colorado Photographer, and author of more books than I&#8217;ve even read on the subject of photography (thanks Joe!)</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">As for the April winner &#8211; well, that will have to wait until Friday now, because I need to take a bit of time and review the images (truthly &#8211; I&#8217;ve not looked at all yet!).  Wednesday has become quite popular as a &#8220;Wordless Wednesday&#8221; item, so I don&#8217;t want to disrupt the little bit of consistency I&#8217;ve developed there.  Thanks to everyone for understanding as the wind truly has blown me onto an entirely new course.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><em>ETA:  As an off-topic note, my new course is now focusing intensely on designing, developing, and delivering training curriculum content for higher education, K-12, and corporate clients, with the K-12 audience being primary in my scope right now.  I am clawing my way up the learning curve here in various programs like Adobe Captivate, Articulate, and much more.  As my ID (Instrucional Design) knowledge and experience expands, I hope to bring this experience back to CB in the form of even better educational and learning resources for the readership &#8211; so rest assured, there is a long term positive here!  The cheesy intros of past videos will likely be replaced, learning objectives will be spelled out, and I hope to also incorporate much of my newly learned content preparation techniques both in digital and DVD form!  (That&#8217;s right, you will be able to order DVD&#8217;s of resources from me &#8211; hopefully not to far into the future!).  For now though, thank you for your patience as I wean myself from the suckle of self-education!</em></p><div

style="text-align: justify;">Repeat after me&#8230;is the one you have with you!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">While traveling recently (my DSLR is just too bulky for most of my travel lately), I was at a wedding in OH and did not have my gear with me.  A few snaps went around on the phone before I just tucked it away and played the part of spousal arm candy.  Once tucked away, those of us circa 1980&#8242;s started getting our groove on.  At one point out of the corner of my eye, the disco lights were dancing across the ceiling and something inside me just said&#8230;&#8221;Hmmmmm.&#8221; <strong>SNAP!</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a

style="text-align: justify;">Sure, it&#8217;s no masterpiece, and was taken from my iPhone, but something about it just makes me chuckle.  The point being?  Always have <strong>a </strong>camera with you.  Any camera.  If there&#8217;s nothing there, you&#8217;ll not capture a thing.   This will never sit in the Louvre, but I got a kick out of it.  And I took it on my phone camera!</p><p

class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7722" title="Bogen/Manfrotto Tripod" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/548524.jpg" alt="Bogen/Manfrotto Tripod" width="500" height="500" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">When traveling recently, I decided to take along my tripod, mount, and video camera to record the training trip (sort of a milestone goal, so it had to be done at some point).  That means on the trip out, I had three items:</p><ol><li>Laptop bag</li><li>Carry-on bag</li><li>Tripod (in its own tripod bag</li></ol><p
style="text-align: justify;">The gate agent noticed I had the tripod with me and suggested I gate check it as the flight was nearly full and there might not be room for it in the overhead.  Okay, fine.  On the return trip, the gate agent told me I was over the two-bag limit and one would have to be checked to my final destination.  My understanding had always been that tripod bags are not counted against the two-bag limit, but whatever.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Then I was informed that my suitcase would not fit in the overhead bin, and I would have to gate-check that as well.  So now I am going from three bags down to two, and finally one bag in flight.  Huh?  Well, no worries, it&#8217;s a non-stop direct flight, what can happen?</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">On arrival, I get my gate checked suitcase, and mosey down to baggage claim.  After waiting for about an hour in case it got missed in the initial sweep, realized that it either never got taken off and took off for the next destination, or someone forgot to enter it into the belly of the plane and my trusty tripod was still in Kentucky.  So, I head over to the claim counter.  They said it could take up to five days.  If not found in 5 days, I can submit a claim for a replacement.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Assuming the tripod is not found, I need to get a new one, and it will obviously be covered by United.  I have a couple options here:</p><ol><li>Give an estimated value for the tripod, ball head, and umbrella, get a check from them and go shopping</li><li>Go find the closest make/model, buy it and send them the receipt? (They don&#8217;t make my particular model anymore)</li></ol><p
style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What would you do?</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">My other concern is over the inconsistent policies applied&#8230;is that worth writing to UA about to let them know?  I obviously will be compensated if the tripod is lost, so not sure I am really &#8220;harmed&#8221; here or that it&#8217;s worth even raising a fuss about it.  In the past my knee-jerk has been to write and vent, but anymore (maybe because I am getting older) it seems like it&#8217;s hardly worth the effort.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What would you do?</strong></p><div

style="text-align: justify;">Guest post by Joe Farace</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CB6.jpg" rel="lightbox[7708]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7709" title="Joe Farace Sports Photography" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CB6-500x305.jpg" alt="Joe Farace Sports Photography" width="500" height="305" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Some of following suggestions about photographing any kind of motorsport event may seem obvious to some of this blog&#8217;s readers but if you follow them I’ll guarantee that it will result in your capturing better images because there won’t be any non-photographic distractions.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Park your vehicle in a designated parking spot. The last thing you need to hear when you are getting ready to photograph a championship event is the race announcer calling “will the owner of the orange Gremlin, please move your car or be towed.”</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Remain behind safety barriers at all times. But safety barriers are not set up everywhere so use your judgment when choosing a place to photograph the races. If you’re not sure about the location you have selected, chances are a safety worker will shortly arrive and ask you to move. Be nice to them; they have a tough enough job.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">It may not be hot at the track but it surely will be loud. Bring earplugs. If you don&#8217;t have a set, most tracks’ concession stands sell inexpensive earplugs but plan ahead and make sure to have several pair in your camera bag. They are easy to loose but are inexpensive to replace. As Emeril always says: &#8220;Make a friend.&#8221; Share with someone who forgot theirs.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Be alert while in the pits because there will be many scooters, 4-wheelers, motorcycles, or golf carts transporting people around. Be alert for cars getting ready to enter the staging area. Racecars don’t have horns like the family jalopy but you should hear them coming—even with earplugs.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">As with most professional sport facilities, photographers are typically only allowed to make video or still pictures of the vehicles for personal use and they may not be sold or marketed without having a prior arrangement from the speedway and/or the sanctioning body. Save yourself any legal hassle but taking care of this when obtaining your track credentials. That doesn’t mean you can’t sell photographs to the teams and racers on the track, which can help make you a few bucks.</p><p

My friend Matt Staver is a talented, young photographer who often asks me “what was your objective in making that photograph” but I seldom have a good answer for him.</p><p>At the FOTOfusion conference a few years ago I conducted a workshop called “Right in Your Own Backyard” which was based on the premise that you needn’t travel halfway around the world when great photo ops are closer to home. When showing an image made, literally, in my backyard, one of the students asked, “What prompted you to make that picture.” Answering was difficult because it addressed the thought processes going on while an image is created but I never got that question out of my head and so decided to show you how a specific photograph was made.</p><p><a

class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7689" title="Selective Toning by Joe Farace" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CB.4-400x162.jpg" alt="Selective Toning by Joe Farace" width="400" height="162" /></a></p><p>This portrait of my wife Mary was made in my real back yard (in a former residence, not on Daisy Hill where I now live) using a Hasselblad Xpan film camera and is the full image of the camera’s 35mm panoramic frame. In this case, the portrait was created as a homage to the work of Phil Borges who is not only an extremely gifted photographer but is also a humanitarian. One of the techniques Mr. Borges uses is called “selective toning” which is different from split toning although the effect is similar because the image maker gets to determine which specific area of the photograph is toned in different colors or tones by using masking techniques.</p><p>In the traditional darkroom the effect can be achieved by coating the areas of the print that you do not wish to tone in that particular color with liquid rubber cement. You apply carefully this goopy stuff with a brush, let it dry and then immerse the print in the toner solution. After washing and drying the rubber cement peels off easily you can then apply rubber cement to the areas that you just toned and then re-tone the print in another color of toner. If all that sound complicated and messy, it is, but the effects can be dramatic. This same technique is much easier to accomplish using digital techniques and layers. After scanning the panoramic images, I created two layers; one was toned, was not. Then I erased everything on the “toned” layer but Mary’s face. To finish it off and give the portrait a real film look, I applied one of Kevin Kubota’s Sloppy Borders effects.</p><p>You can follow Joe on his own blog, <a

style="text-align: justify;">A friend recently asked me why his camera was so slow to focus.  The answer naturally started with (as do most answers in photography) my standard phrase, &#8220;It depends&#8230;&#8221;  I realized after my conversation with him that this would be an excellent topic for exploring here on the blog.  So, today, we&#8217;ll be taking a look at focusing concepts in your camera gear.  To start off, it probably makes the most sense to identify that there are focusing features both on your camera, and on your lens.  On cameras, it&#8217;s most often referred to as the &#8220;auto-focusing system&#8221; or AF.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><strong>AF Systems</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/E7D/E7DA4.HTM"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7677" title="Canon 7D AF System" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ZAFPOINTCOVERAGE-400x329.jpg" alt="Canon 7D AF System" width="400" height="329" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The above AF system comes from the Canon 7D, but generally speaking, newer cameras will have better AF systems than older cameras.  What makes them better is the presence of more AF points.  The more points the sensor has, the easier it is to identify a point to focus on.  The AF system identifies these points based on contrast between light and dark, so reflected light does matter to a degree as well. The bottom line though is that with more focusing points, more focus detection, better contrast algorithms, etc. and better sensitivity to light will allow a camera to find a subject quicker than its older counterpart with fewer AF points.  Of course, the AF system is only as good as the lens that it connects to, and the lighting conditions you are in.  If you have a great AF system (camera body) and a slower lens (an aperture in the range of f4 or f5.6), you will still be limited by light.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><em>The upshot:  More AF points = Better Camera (in general)</em></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">While there are always exceptions and nuances or unique scenarios for specialty gear, focusing speed is really more a function of the lens than the camera body.  What you will find in bodies though, is that you get better target acqusition and tracking on the higher end bodies than the entry-level models (say an Xsi versus a 1DMark II).   The camera basically does the job of saying &#8220;here&#8217;s the point to focus on&#8221;, and then transfers the job to the lens of actually making that point the sharpest one in the picture.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">One question that I often hear though is &#8220;So, what defines how fast the focus locks &#8211; the AF system or the lens?&#8221;  The answer is that the AF system does the focus lock &#8211; the &#8220;lock&#8221; is really just defining the point to focus on&#8230;it&#8217;s just a fancier way of saying it.  If you have no point locked in, even the fastest lens will just search and search and not bring anything sharp because it doesn&#8217;t know <strong>what</strong> to make sharp.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">I would be remiss though if I didn&#8217;t acknowledge that newer cameras do work better in lower light too though, because they do.  Here&#8217;s why:  you will get better low light performance on a higher end body, simply because the sensor is larger, and more sensitive to light.  But when we start talking about light, we have to actually give more of a nod to the lens.</p><p><strong
style="text-align: justify;">Lens Focusing</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Where camera bodies pull their weight in target acquisition and tracking, lenses pull their weight when it comes to operation in lower lighting conditions.  The larger your aperture (the smaller number actually means a wider open aperture, remember?), the better it will perform in low light because you are simply letting more light get to the sensor.  That lens that opens to f2.8 will let more light in regardless of the body it is connected to!  This is why expensive lenses that can open t f2.8, f2.0 or even wider are referred to as &#8220;fast glass&#8221; because they let such a large amount of light onto <strong>any</strong> sensor.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The other part of what really gives a nod to lenses over bodies is that lenses are what actually <em>does</em> the focusing.  Adjusting the focus to something that is &#8220;sharp&#8221; is done by the lens.  Where the camera said &#8220;Hey, cool, I&#8217;ve found the point to focus on&#8221;, here, the lens uses the AF points from the camera body and basically says &#8220;okay, I am going to focus in on this point that you&#8217;ve defined.&#8221;</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The last point to bring up here is to mention the focusing motor of the lens.  Terms that are often bandied about include USM, HSM, and other similar terms.  This is where it can get really confusing because each vendor uses unique terms, and even within a specific vendor, the same letters can mean different things.  Here&#8217;s (since it&#8217;s the <em>CanonBlogger</em> site), I am going to stick to the Canon nomenclature for now, which is the USM.  In the Canon family, USM is seen in many lenses and has quite a history.  It started in the body before the digital camera revolution.  When Canon introduced the EF lens mount in 1987, the technology was available to put the USM on the lens, which allowed it to operate even faster.  They never looked back!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, USM is bandied about within the Canon family, and you have to be careful now, because one is used to identify a lens feature, while the other is more marketing and hype (in my opinion anyway).  The one that really matters are the ones that refer to the Ring USM.  These lenses are more expensive, heavier than their counterparts, are much quieter, and also tend to bring the subject into focus faster.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><a

class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7676" title="Canon USM Feature Explained" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/caption_001-400x309.png" alt="Canon USM Feature Explained" width="400" height="309" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The alternate motor or Micromotor Ultrasonic Drives are the ones used in cheaper lenses, which by comparison are lighter, noisier, and focus more slowly on the subject.  Most kit lenses are of these variety.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">What did we learn here?  First off, hopefully you&#8217;ve come away with a better understanding of body AF systems versus lens focusing.  On the most simple of explanations &#8211; a camera AF system says where to focus, and the lens is what actually does the focusing.  It should come as no surprise though, that both tie in very tightly to <strong><em>light</em></strong>.  In the body, better sensitivity to light allows for better contrast in the AF points, while in the lens, the wider aperture can bring more light in under conditions where a narrower opening would not suffice.  So, higher sensitivity and wider openings can impact contrast and focusing speed in bodies and lenses respectively.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The bottom line:  neither does this task independently, but when  it comes to speed &#8211; most of this comes from your lens, not your body!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">*****</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">Let’s face it – we have a lot to keep up on these days.  On top of managing our own social media footprints, there are magazines to read, forums to attend to (building and engaging with your own community of colleagues and friends), gear reviews, software tutorials, tech conferences, and then of course all the other life activities like laundry, cooking, cleaning, and all that other fun stuff that takes all of our time away from what we really enjoy doing:  creating content!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">But if you look at all the other stuff that goes on instead of creating content, what it boils down to is that we spend most of our time consuming content.  Thus begins the debate over how much time should be spent on consumption versus creation.  It’s a question creative ask themselves all the time:  “why does it seem I spend only X% of my time creating and Y% doing other stuff?”</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The answer to the question of consumption versus creation is because we are always learning.  Anyone who stands up and says they know everything about any subject is feeding you a polished pile of…well, you get the idea…  We are always learning.  If you are reading a magazine, you are learning new material.  If you are perusing another artists portfolio (yes, even your friends)…you are learning about what inspires others (and may in turn inspire yourself).  Watching tutorials?  Yep, that’s learning new tips and tricks too!  Notice a trend here?  Hopefully by now you see that consumption is just another word for learning!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">So, never be afraid of saying that you are consuming more than you are creating – consuming is just a fancy word for learning, and learning is good!  What are you consuming today?</p><p

Both Joe&#8217;s schedule and my own are just not playing nicely, so be on the lookout for details to be announced as we get closer to May.  In the meantime, make sure you catch yesterday&#8217;s guest post from Joe about <a
