title="Lightroom Four " href="http://www.canonblogger.com/2012/01/10/lightroom-4-beta/">here on the blog</a> (albeit in Beta format), but now that the hubbub has all died down, it was great to take a step back and really look at the nitty gritty details of the application with the calculating eyes of Laura Shoe!  For those of you that don&#8217;t know Laura &#8211; she&#8217;s an educator and trainer and has released her own DVD and Video resource manual for everything you need to know about LR4.  I invited her on the show to share some thoughts and insights on a deeper level for everyone.  We talk about our favorite features,and look at the roadmap for the program.  Can there possibly be more?  What has Adobe missed or should we expect to see in the future?  We also tackle a few listener questions, so be sure to get the latest from <strong>The Learning Digital Photography Podcast!</strong></p><p

style="text-align: justify;">The latest episode of the Learning Digital Photography podcast is now ready for your listening enjoyment.  This month we talk with Dave Seeram, editor of the popular online magazine, <a
title="PhotographyBB" href="http://www.photographybb.com" target="_blank">PhotographyBB</a> about what he (and most editors) look for both in photographs and in written work (for you photo journalists) before going to press.  It&#8217;s a great show and there&#8217;s lots of useful information there, so download and enjoy episode #67 of the Learning Digital Photography Podcast today!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">In other blog and podcast news, after the absence of a contest for February, we&#8217;re back and ready for photos in March.  Joe Farace, writer of a popular column in Shutterbug magazine, and fellow Coloradan gives away not one but two copies of his Studio Lighting Anywhere book.  Standard contest rules apply.  Here&#8217;s the particulars:</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">1. One photo per person<br
/> 2. Must be work-safe/family-friendly<br
/> 3. Posted to this Flickr thread<br
/> 4. Largest side must be no more than 800px or less than 600px (this is only so that the winning image can be displayed well&#8230;)<br
/> 5. Taken within the last 60 days (preferably during the contest window)<br
/> 6. Images must be done by Saturday, March 31st.<br
/> 7. Theme is  <strong>PEOPLE</strong><br
/> 8. And most importantly, have fun!</p><p

style="text-align: justify;"><a
href="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3rdgen.png" rel="lightbox[7501]"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7502" title="3rd Gen Cameras" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/3rdgen-400x295.png" alt="3rd Gen Cameras" width="400" height="295" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The latest and greatest from the podcast laboratory is a discussion with my good friend Kerry Garrison, and we tackle this hot topic of 3rd generation cameras.  Are these for real?  What is the deal?  What to look for,  pros and cons&#8230;and a teaser about the DIY Prequel!  All that bundled into a great episode of <strong>The Learning Digital Photography Podcast! </strong>(Episode #66).</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">For another bit of maintenance, I was reminded that the January contest ended and I never launched the February contest, so apologies to all who waited so patiently!  Bragging rights for January (and February I guess), go to:</p><p
style="text-align: center;"><span
style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Evelyn B</strong></span></p><p
style="text-align: center;"><a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/36214837@N04/"><img
class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-7503" title="EvelynB" src="http://www.canonblogger.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/EvelynB-400x266.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="266" /></a></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Evelyn gets to pick the theme for the March contest!  And it&#8217;s with great excitement that I share the news there will be two winners for the month of March!  My new friend Joe Farace (fellow photographer and Coloradan, as well as an esteemed journalist and long-time writer for Shutterbug magazine) has contributed not one but two copies of his book titled &#8220;Studio Lighting Anywhere&#8221;!  You can read reviews and catch a sneak peak of his book over on Amazon, or simply submit your photo to the March contest thread, which is <strong>open early!</strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">So, get shooting, and look for the word from Evelyn (hopefully in this thread) on what our theme will be.  Standard contest rules apply!  The thread will go live hopefully by the end of the weekend (this also gives Evelyn some time to both brag about her win and think about the theme!)  Before we sign off for the weekend though, here&#8217;s the show notes for the 75 minute podcast with Kerry!</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">The first podcast of 2012 is now ready for your listening pleasure!  I had the distinct honor of talking with long time photographer and author Joe Farace!  A contributing writer for Shutterbug Magazine, and author of several blogs, it was a great way to kick off the new year!  We had a great chat for about 45 minutes (on the record anyway)&#8230;and talked about everything from posing models, to lighting them, as well as some travel photography&#8230;heck, we even talked cars for a bit too!</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">When confronted with a new field of study, one is often thrust into the deep end of the pool both figuratively and literally.  It&#8217;s tough to learn to swim quickly.  You will likely learn the bare bones to keep your head above water (i.e. flapping your arms about madly will  usually create enough energy to keep you afloat), but you certainly won&#8217;t learn to become an Olympic caliber swimmer on your own.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Self-study may even get you to a point where you can cut through the water relatively easily, but imagine how much easier it would be if when you first started learning to swim, you had a coach.  Someone there to stand at the pool, shouting out encouragement and instructions:  &#8220;Reach out with your hands!  Kick your legs!  Good job!  Keep going!&#8221;</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Coaching always makes learning anything easier, whether it&#8217;s swimming, science or photography!  One of the things I&#8217;ve noticed as progressing on my own learning curve is that much of what I gathered would have likely been learned moer quickly if someone had been there to say &#8220;Hey, the Rule of Thirds works nicely with landscapes&#8230;put the sun in one of those cross-sections!&#8221;  or other axioms common to learning the nuts and bolts.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">This raised a question in my mind, and is actually one of the fundamental reasons why I started this blog &#8211; to share experiences as I learned them to help others hopefully reach those levels of understanding sooner.  When someone asked me once how long I had been mentoring other photographers is when it dawned on me that I actually had become something of what I had needed!  Talk about a sense of fulfillment!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">These thoughts and experiences were recently shared with my good friend Kerry Garrison of <a
title="Camera Dojo" href="http://www.cameradojo.com" target="_blank">Camera Dojo</a>, and as we talked about the whole concept of mentoring, decided this would be a great podcast topic!  So, enjoy the latest episode of the LDP Podcast (#63):  <strong>Choosing a Mentor</strong>:</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Show notes:  What to Look for in a Mentor</p> <address
style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1.  Desire to Help</strong></address> <address
style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2.  Previous positive experiences</strong></address> <address
style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3.  A Good Reputation</strong></address> <address
style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4.  Time and Energy<br
/> </strong></address> <address
style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5.   Someone who stays current</strong></address> <address
style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6.  Willingness to Learn themselves</strong></address> <address
style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>7.  Good managerial skills</strong></address><p
style="text-align: justify;">We go into all of this in much greater detail in the show, as to why each trait is important, and we even throw in a few bonus considerations for you too, so be sure to catch the show!  Thanks again to Kerry for participating &#8211; it was a great discussion and sure to be one that will draw a lot of attention!  Be sure to stop over to Kerry&#8217;s blog to find out the latest activities there too at <a
title="Camera Dojo" href="http://www.cameradojo.com" target="_blank">Camera Dojo</a>.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Food for thought:  As you listen to the show, consider the following talking points&#8230;have you ever had a mentor?  Been a mentor?  Wanted a mentor?  Had one that worked or did not?  Think about what did and didn&#8217;t work, and why.  What would you want to see in a potential mentor?  As is always the case, we share our own ideas, but would love to hear from others on what their own experiences are, so please let us know in the comments and/or via email, social media, etc.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Happy shooting!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">*****</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">A couple short reminders for this week:</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">1.  We are in the last week of the Monthly Contest Series for September.  This month you can win a year of membership to NAPP (existing members can extend for an additional 12 months!)!  It&#8217;s free, just share your best image in the Flickr thread <a
title="LDP Monthly Contest Series - September!" href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/ldp_podcast/discuss/72157627612162798//" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">2.  The Worldwide Photo Walk is coming up this weekend, so if you&#8217;ve not registered in your nearest city yet, be sure to check out where the closest place is.  It&#8217;s a lot of fun, and is totally free too, so get out and shoot with fellow photogs, socialize, and network!  Oh yeah, and a ton of books are being given away &#8211; something from the Kelby arsenal of education will go to one lucky photographer in each city!  (If you live in the Denver Colorado area, there&#8217;s still room in the <a
title="Worldwide Photo Walk - Louisville CO" href="http://worldwidephotowalk.com/walk/louisville-co-united-states-harper-lake/" target="_blank">Louisville walk</a> too where you can walk around with yours truly!)</p><div

style="text-align: justify;">One of the best parts of blogging is getting a chance to meet other photographers, both far and wide.  Through innovations like Skype, webinars, and teleconferencing I&#8217;ve been able to reach out to California, across to the East Coast, and even across the pond to the UK and as far as Sweden.  Then, it dawned on me that I&#8217;ve not featured local photographers on the blog that much, if at all.  Just like photography, there are photographers everywhere to learn from, and Arvada Colorado is no exception.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">To that end, today&#8217;s podcast ventures a mere 10 miles away, where I caught up with fellow NAPP member, Michelle Hedstrom!  We actually met for a face to face and of course, the audio was recording&#8230;for podcast #62 &#8211; Grinding it Out!  We talked about everything from getting started in photography, to sports and concert photography, and what it takes to really succeed in this business.  In a nutshell &#8211; just grinding it out!  For all the details, check out the show!</p><p><a

style="text-align: justify;">For those of you who might not know who Dave is &#8211; he&#8217;s one of the original &#8220;Photoshop Guys&#8221;, and has been teaching Photoshop classes since version 2!  He is currently the Senior Developer, Education and Curriculum for NAPP, a Certified Photoshop Instructor through Cs4, and  Certified Technical Trainer.  With several books under his belt, and a 2009 inductee to the Photoshop Hall of Fame, he is certainly no stranger to the world of Photoshop!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Here&#8217;s the nuts and bolts of our discussion, but to get the full schmear, grab the podcast either from here or in iTunes!</p><p
style="text-align: center;"><strong>Talking Points:  Shooting with Photoshop in Mind</strong></p><ul><li>What&#8217;s the point of Photoshop:  Fixing photos or creating visions?</li><li>Compositing Photos in Photoshop</li><li>Story boarding, green screens, extracting &#8211; options galore</li><li>How do you get there from here?</li><li>Fine Art versus Business</li><li>Learning Workshops versus Seminars</li><li>Watching versus Doing</li><li>HDR:  Art form or a Solution?</li><li>Links<ul><li><a

style="text-align: justify;">It was so fun talking to Dave about such a wide variety of subjects and we really hit on quite a bit for only 40 minutes of talk time!  Do check out his web resources there as I think the smaller sized workshop setting he has set up in Tampa will become the trend-setter of things to come.</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">As a final reminder for the podcast and website a couple things wrap up this week:  The month long <a

title="DIY Legal Kit (and other eBooks) Page" href="http://www.canonblogger.com/education/ebooks/" target="_blank">DIY Legal Kit</a> was released, and then work got busy, and yesterday was Tracy&#8217;s birthday, so we spent the evening doing fun stuff for her (shopping, eating at her favorite restaurants, movies, etc.)  Suffice to say, I did not even get the show notes together for the podcast here with Andie &#8211; but at the very least I did want to get the podcast itself up&#8230;so the show notes should follow probably tomorrow (yes, a Sat. post!)</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">One final little trailer teaser here for ya, since I had my last two podcasts with my good friends Andie and AJ (they live like ten miles from each other), figured to give him some linkage too &#8211; his new podcast is live now in its second episode, so stop over to <a
title="AJ Wood Lightroom Blitz" href="http://ajwood.com/2011/06/i-create-content-2/" target="_blank">AJ Wood</a> to check it out &#8211; fun, fast, and informative!</p><p

style="text-align: justify;">For those of you that may not have heard of him, Kevin Mullins hails from across the pond to get together on a podcast and talk shop on photography.  A well-established wedding photographer in the UK, Kevin is probably one of the most talented wedding photographers I know.  He joins me in the latest episode of the Learning Digital Photography Podcast to talk about the documentary style of photography and the impact that has on how you both shoot and manage your business.  You can download it from iTunes or directly from the website via the following links.  Below the links are the show notes&#8230;enjoy!</p><ul><li><p

style="text-align: justify;">Twitter, Facebook, microblogging, blogging, Audioboo, websites, statistics, logos, graphics, web design and more!  It&#8217;s a lot to take in and more often than not photographers who are just getting started ask me &#8220;Which ones should I choose?&#8221;  It&#8217;s a tough question because there&#8217;s no unilateral catch-all answer that will fit everyone.  As always, the answer starts with &#8220;It depends&#8230;&#8221;</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">So, to better address the question I decided to bring in a pro who deals with this stuff all the time.  That&#8217;s right ladies and gentlemen, we have <strong>another podcast! </strong>This is episode #56 of the LDP show, and I shared about an hour or so with Kirsten Wright talking about social strategies and best approaches and practices.  It&#8217;s an entire industry, and there are some who claim to know and then those who really do know their stuff.  Kirsten comes with some impressive credentials and a fresh outlook/perspective that many of us need.  It&#8217;s a good kick in the&#8230;well, a good way to get motivated to get going in the right direction!</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Make sure you check out her site over at <a
title="Wright Creativity" href="http://wrightcreativity.com/blog/" target="_blank">Wright Creativity</a> and make sure to add her on your <a
title="Kirsten on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/kirstenwright">Twitter</a>, Facebook, LinkedIn feeds, and everything in between.  She&#8217;s got gems and nuggets of brilliance galore to share.  I&#8217;m booking her soon here to help me get things streamlined (in case you haven&#8217;t noticed, my schedule has not been as consistent lately as I&#8217;d like it to be &#8211; Kirsten is my kick in the #$%^!)</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">If you need some focus, direction, and a good reality check, Kirsten is the one to give t to you.  Get it for free here in the latest episode of Learning Digital Photography:  Is Blogging Dead? with our guest of the hour &#8211; Kirsten Wright!</p><p

style="text-align: justify;"><em>Editor Note: Episode #53 of the podcast is ready for your holiday listening enjoyment!  This should have gone out last week, so my apologies.  System problems with the post production delayed the publication, but better late than never is my motto!  Anyway, enjoy!<br
/> </em></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">Many notable photographers have spoken and alluded to this idea of shooting photography with passion.  The idea is to approach photography with your creative voice, and a vision of what it is you want to accomplish.  So, what do you do when the voice is silent, or the vision is blinded?  Re-igniting the passion for photography is something we all face, and while we can all agree that shooting with passion is always a good thing, the question really is how to achieve that intangible in your work.  Tune in to the latest podcast here with Andie Smith as we broach the subject head on.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">We also tackle some really engaging listener questions, so be sure to listen in &#8211; yours may be answered!</p><p

We also tackle some really engaging listener questions, so be sure to listen in &#8211; yours may be answered!</itunes:summary> <itunes:keywords>Announcements, photography, podcast</itunes:keywords> <itunes:author>Jason Anderson</itunes:author> <itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit> <itunes:block>no</itunes:block> </item> <item><title>Episode #52 &#8211; Why We Charge!</title><link>http://www.canonblogger.com/2010/11/09/episode-52-why-we-charge/</link> <comments>http://www.canonblogger.com/2010/11/09/episode-52-why-we-charge/#comments</comments> <pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2010 07:30:56 +0000</pubDate> <dc:creator>Jason</dc:creator> <category><![CDATA[Announcements]]></category> <category><![CDATA[Learning Digital Photography Podcast]]></category> <category><![CDATA[News]]></category> <category><![CDATA[photography]]></category> <category><![CDATA[podcast]]></category> <category><![CDATA[web links]]></category> <category><![CDATA[audio]]></category> <category><![CDATA[learning digital photography]]></category><guid

style="text-align: justify;">As we start drawing into the fall, time becomes an increasingly precious commodity, I am hoping to sustain the full length feature podcasts, but in case timing doesn&#8217;t permit that, some podcast shorts will become available.  These will be short audio commentaries on a number of topics, all seeking to encourage debate and discussion.  Sometimes they will touch on volatile topics, other times, not as volatile, but hopefully equally interesting.  Today, the first of likely many audio shorts expands on the lighting post from last week.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;"><span
id="more-4843"></span></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">For those of you that are picking these up via the iTunes feed, not sure if the recent changes in feed format will report this short an audio piece, but it should be there eventually.  If not, it&#8217;s less than five minutes time, and is easily listened to while in your browser.  Also, you can pick it up from the non-iTunes feed here as well, so give it a listen&#8230;for those wishing to comment/respond to the inquiry, here&#8217;s the post that I am talking about:</p><p

style="font-size: large;">First up, the podcast&#8230;</span></span></strong></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">I had another great chat with Kerry Garrison about a week ago about when and why to upgrade your camera body.  With the 60D now in the market, and Photokina just starting yesterday, there&#8217;s going to be lots of opportunities to buy.  When looking at all the options of whether new features are worth the upgrade.  Check it out!  The show notes are more detailed, so will likely go out tomorrow separately, but wanted to let people catch it today because of a special sponsor&#8230;</p><p

style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Drobo 3-Day Sweepstakes Giveaway</strong></span></span></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">For some time now I have been working on getting some preferred vendors in line for the monthly podcast series and the regular contest over on Flickr.  One of those sponsors I have been working with is Data Robotics.  I received word yesterday that some advertising dollars were still available for 3rd quarter, and if I could act fast, we could run a giveaway for Canon Blogger readers and podcast listeners.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">So, the blog post for the podcast got bumped so I could add an intro there about the giveaway, (you can get all the details about the 3-Day Giveaway <a

style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>David Ziser Denver Seminar</strong></span></span></p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The other news item of note was the David Ziser seminar I attended on Monday.  This is his 2010 tour, titled <strong>Captured By The Light</strong>, and I had an opportunity to assist as a volunteer for the show&#8230;taking registrations, assisting with product sales, and setup/breakdown.  The seminar was probably one of the best I have attended (and I&#8217;ve taken in a few&#8230;).</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">The sheer quantity of material was amazing&#8230;and with the added door prizes, I can totally see the value behind this event.  He had over $6000 in door prizes!  In addition to the swag that was given to every attendee, including free months of memberships for things like Kelby Training,  a free 1 year membership to WPPI, 20% off discounts for things like the Spyder3Pro, Animoto discounts, 4-month subscription to Professional Photographer.</p><p
style="text-align: justify;">It was just a great time.  It was an honor to participate, and I would like to take a moment here on the blog to thank David and his staff for their down-to-earth and welcoming approach.  For more information on the Captured By The Light Tour and to see if he&#8217;s coming to a city near you, check out the details here:  <a
