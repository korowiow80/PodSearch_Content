This is Mystic Babylon broadcasting from near Haight Street with the best of San Francisco poetry. Today we have some poetry from two other poets besides me. First I have some poetry from a poet who asked me a long time ago to record some of her works named Lenore Weiss. She gave me a disk of what she called cell-phone poetry and I extracted one small snippet from that recording. 
	After that I have some poetry from a poet named David Alpaugh. He also runs a small press. David Alpaugh&#8217;s works have appeared in more than a hundred literary journals and anthologies. His first collection, Counterpoint, won a prize, and is published by Story Line Press. He has had chapbooks published by Coracle Books and Pudding House Publications.
His new book HEAVY LIFTING has just been published by Alehouse Press. Order it direct from the poet for $15 postpaid: Small Poetry Press Distribution, P.O. Box 5342, Concord, CA 94524, or go to: 
http://www.alehousepress.com . He has his small press at: http://www.smallpoetrypress.com . 
	May I remind you to read and buy our books. My poetry book is: Spirits of Bondage and Inherent Transcendence, and my new novel is called: Little Bird Told Me. My voice-over for that book is almost finished and as soon as I get it submitted to Audible.com in its full version, for sale, I will start posting it chapter by chapter over a whole year. 
     David's picture and part of the cover from his new book is above.

This is Mystic Babylon Open Mike Poetry Podcast broadcasting from near the Haight. Today we have two poets besides me. These poets are H.D. Moe and Doug Reese. H.D. Moe has many, many books out which can be purchased from numerous places, the main one being his web site at: http://www.hdmoe.com . The second poet, Doug Reese is a close friend of Moe&#8217;s and has some very good poems here. 
     I, being much like the Huichol Indians in Mexico who eat Peyote, don&#8217;t have curse words in my vocabulary, (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huichol), but I try not to rationalize and censor, when people want to use them in their poems, so, I have permitted a few to slip under the wire. Even when censoring serves its purpose it is also a form of rational analysis based on preset values that impose upon the freedom of the mind. I have thusly put explicit on this particular podcast in iTunes, whatever that must mean.
	May I remind you to buy the author&#8217;s books. My book is, &#8220;Spirits of Bondage and Inherent Transcendence&#8221;. It is fun buying books to put on your shelves. I am waiting, for instance, for Donovon&#8217;s newly published autobiography: &#8220;The Hurdy Gurdy Man&#8221;. My new book, &#8220;Little Bird Told Me&#8221; might delay a little bit, but be patient, and it will be out soon. </description>

	May I remind you to buy the author&#8217;s books. My book is, &#8220;Spirits of Bondage and Inherent Transcendence&#8221;. It is fun buying books to put on your shelves. I am waiting, for instance, for Donovon&#8217;s newly published autobiography: &#8220;The Hurdy Gurdy Man&#8221;. My new book, &#8220;Little Bird Told Me&#8221; might delay a little bit, but be patient, and it will be out soon. </itunes:summary>

      <title>Mystic Babylon Open Mic Poetry Podcast: No. 26</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/9079/600x600_627900.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, this is Mystic Babylon Open Mike Poetry Podcast recording from near the Haight in San Francisco. Today we have only one poet besides me, but we have a special treat today. We have Judith  Barnett who works at the Beat Museum in the North Beach area of San Francisco near City Lights Bookstore where the Beats came from. The URL of the Beat Museum is: http://www.thebeatmuseum.org  . I met her at the open mikes that they hold there regularly. 
     I have one proverb to state as we approach the end of this intro that I hope you consider worthy. Why do we fight battles in Iraq where more people die, when we could fight battles on Cancer right in the U.S. where fewer people would die? As you might notice in Judith&#8217;s poetry she talks about her fight with Cancer. Let&#8217;s hope that she wins. I remember reading a book when I was about ten years old about cancer called &#8220;Death Be Not Proud&#8221;, by John Gunther. I recommend it. 
Judith has a book coming out hopefully in February. It is called &#8220;Critics and Other Lovers&#8221;. Please by it if you can. You will probably be able to buy it through the Beat Museum. </description>

This is Mystic Babylon Open Mike Poetry Podcast broadcasting from near the Haight with as usual, for my audio podcast, two other poets. The two poets are Joanna Planteen whose pen name is Monique Marquisa de Magdelena, and the other poet is Dorothy Walters.  Joanna, or Monique, as she calls herself, is going to have an all-female poetry collective with a first show Dec. 2nd. Info about this can be found at: http://www.thebeatmuseum.org ,  or  http://www.thewordparty.com . From what I understand, it will be at the Beat Museum at 7:00 pm the aforementioned day. You can hear some of Monique&#8217;s  early all-girl band at http://www.inflatableboyclams.com  .  She hopes to have a web site running at http://www.moniquepoet.com  within a few weeks or so . 
	Dorothy Walters has two books out. She is into Kundalini awakening, and writes about it in her books. Her poetry book is entitled: &#8220;Marrow of Flame&#8221; which are poems of a spiritual journey, and she has another book, a spiritual auto-biography, called &#8220;Unmasking the Rose&#8221; which she describes as a record of a Kundalini Initiation also with some poetry in it.  She has a blog at http://kundalinisplendor.blogspot.com . 
	Must I remind you to buy our books. My book is available from most on-line bookstores and is called: &#8220;Spirits of Bondage and Inherent Transcendence&#8221;. I probably will only read 60 or 70 of the poems online from that book which has a total of about 180 poems in it so please buy it, to read the rest of the poems.  I want to publish another book of poems that I have, but I need your support so I can afford it. At least, thanks for listening. The photo is an image of Dorothy Walters.</description>

Today we are having two poets besides me. They are James Frame and J.R. Jimmy Hammond. James Frame grew up in Sonoma California, lived in San Francisco most of his adult life, and was a Combat Medic in the Vietnam War. He was influenced by the beat poets, and Robinson Jeffers as a young man. He remembers reading in open mikes way back in the 70&#8217;s, in North Beach and in the Haight at the &#8220;Blue Unicorn&#8221;. The 70&#8217;s doesn&#8217;t sound that far back, but I guess to this generation it is. 
     J. R.  Jimmy Hammond is a big fixture in the San Francisco open mikes, and was a district winner in the Poets Eleven Contest in San Francisco, which is to a large extent run by the poet laureate of San Francisco, Jack Hirschman. He was influenced by Bukowski.
     These two poets I connected up with at the 3300 Club at 30th and Mission. 
     I will as usual read 3 of my poems from my book, &quot;Spirits of Bondage and Inherent Transcendence&#8221; . 
     I hope you like the little icon banner I posted above this intro. Enjoy the open mic poetry. The photo of Jimmy Hammond is courtesy of Clara Hsu.</description>

We have two poets reading on this near Memorial Day Podcast. These two poets are James Tracy and Jeanne Lupton. You can buy one of Jeanne's chapbooks by writing her at : Jeany98@aol.com . James tracy's web site is at: http://www.molotovmouths.com/ , and Jeane Lupton's website is at: http://www.jeannelupton.com.
     This Podcast came out a combination love/war podcast, this time. Note my tongue in cheek comment/pun at the end. I do respect the lives lost in war though, even though I am pacifist, but since all the poets in this podcast do feel the way we do feel, I feel, that I, as a creator of this podcast,shouldn't also, wear a piece of tape over my mouth. Peace to all humans, and if you can, believe in the abrieviation, BOB, (Buy Our Books). The book above is James Tracy's and the photo is Jeanne Lupton</description>

It is a mixed bag of poetry from the Bay Area this time. Some of it is from someone whose alias is Dr. Concrescence, who reads in the Fillmore district, known mainly for its music, and also I returned to Berkeley to get one poet from there named David Gollub. The web site associated with him is http://www.angelfire.com/poetry/wordbeat/ . I hope you enjoy this open mic poetry. It takes a lot of work to get it. I bought some new sound equipment so hopefully my sound will be improving once I tweak it. I, John R., posted the cover of my book above. It has 12 illustrated poems in it similar to the cover and is 8x11. The photo above is David Gollub.</description>
