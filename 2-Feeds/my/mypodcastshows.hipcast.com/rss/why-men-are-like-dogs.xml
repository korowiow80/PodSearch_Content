    <link>http://www.on2url.com/app/adtrack.asp?MerchantID=151406&amp;amp;amp;AdID=438657</link>
    <description>Ladies, are men REALLY like dogs? Personally, I love dogs and I love men. They're both protective, loyal and lovable. The problem today is we have too many &quot;wild dogs&quot; running around (not acting like gentleman),and hurting the hearts and souls of women. Why? Brace yourself ... Because of the way we (as women) are behaving. Yep, we can't escape this one. How we act influences the way men act! LADIES, isn't it time we helped men become more of what we want in a relationship? Isn't it time we dated and married  &quot;gentle &quot; men and not  &quot;wild dogs?&quot; Men are wonderful, protective, playful and lovable. They just need us to show them how to behave towards us. Well, look no further. You've come to the right place. Hi, my name is Mandy Pratt and I'm the author of WHY MEN ARE LIKE DOGS. Together, we'll unveil why men act the way the do, how woman can learn to act more like &quot;Classy Ladies&quot; and as a result? Attract the kind of &quot;Dream King&quot; we women deserve to date and ultimately marry. Won't you join me? Join the CLASSY LADY REVOLUTION!</description>

      <title>Why Men Are Like Dogs (Debut Podcast)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Now, throughout this radio show series, ladies, you’re going to learn why men act the way they do and how you can literally attract that DREAM KING right into your life. That is, date the kind of man you’ve always dreamed of dating and ultimate marrying; and, if you’re married, how to keep your husband hungry for you for the rest of your lives together. Now, who doesn’t want that? Exactly. Also, on the show, and from time to time, I’m going to have several guests pop in (now and then) to help discuss any number of subjects related to love, romance, dating, sex, marriage, communication (between couples), getting out from under “relationship b.s.” (and avoiding it) and a lot more. One of my guests will be a man, (ruff), who is the author of LAWS OF THE BEDROOM: WHAT MEN NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX AND PLEASING A WOMAN. The author of that book is none other than BART SMITH. So, stay tuned for episodes where Bart’s on the show with me. Now, that you’ve heard a little bit about who's going to be on my show from time to time, let’s kick off this debut podcast show with HOW I came up with the title WHY MEN ARE LIKE DOGS (AND HOW WE CAN LOVE THEM). So many people ask me, "Are men really like dogs?" I mean, why dogs? Where did the whole dog-thing come into play?]]></description>
