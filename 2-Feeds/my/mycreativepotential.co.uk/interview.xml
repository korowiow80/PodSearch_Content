            Best-selling author and comedian Tony Hawks, hosted an improv-style ‘flashscribing’ event that saw crowds of people co-create a new short book – each person volunteering a word or sentence following on from the last in a ‘tag-writing’ format.  The crowd decided the book’s heroes, plotline and overall story genre ending up with a classic girl meets boy story with a modern twist on the pitfalls of dating.  An editor recorded the developing story, edited it in real-time and uploaded chapter summaries on to a giant screen to keep the crowd up to date and stimulated.  The completed book will be available on the microsite mycreativepotential.co.uk with each contributor getting a credit.
