<p>Have you ever known better and actually wanted to do better, but didn&#8217;t have the stamina, focus or courage to make it better?</p>
<p>Nicole Steele, author, speaker and Executive Director of  Diamond In The Rough, strongly believes that one of the biggest things that hold WOMEN back from fulfilling their God-given purpose and destiny, is having feelings of inadequacy. They also struggle with unworthiness, fear and regret that often come from having been broken at one point or another.</p>
<p>At the 2012 <em>Helping Women Succeed in Atlanta Summit</em>, Steele shared a vivid account of her personal struggles in dealing with brokenness as well as insights and tips to help others go <em>From Broken to Brilliant</em>. Her presentation included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suggestions on how to transform personal pain into purpose</li>
<li>Identifying the six primary types of brokenness</li>
<li>Ten (10) practical tips on living the life of brilliance that was created just for you</li>
</ul>
<p><span> If you missed the event or are interested in the full presentation, add the complete message to your audio library by ordering the CD, which is available at <a href="http://www.ditr.org/"><strong>www.ditr.org</strong></a> or <a href="http://www.apricelessgem.com/"><strong>www.apricelessgem.com</strong></a><strong>.</strong></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p><center><img class="size-full wp-image-13510  aligncenter" title="Dr. Nancy J. Williams - Natural Healing in Atlanta" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Dr.-Nancy-J.-Williams-Natural-Healing-in-Atlanta.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="550" /></center>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dr. Nancy, holistic doctor and CEO/Visionary of First Fruit Natural Healing Home, had a fear of heights, so she tackled that fear head-on by jumping out of a plane.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“Initially it’s one of the most fearful and terrifying feelings you can have, hanging off the wing of a plane and then your instructor instructs you to let go,” she explains. “But once your parachute opens and you are gliding, you feel a peace and internal stillness come over you.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That wasn’t the first time Dr. Nancy faced down her fears and took a leap of faith. She worked for nearly 20 years as an air traffic controller, becoming the first African American female to be certified at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Although she was earning six figures, she walked away from her corporate job to follow her path of divine purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“I was going through a time with a lot of stress, sickness, and depression,” she says. “I started learning about the holistic approach to wellness and applying that to my own life.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">After discovering how to start healing her mind, body, and soul, Dr. Nancy made it her mission to help others do the same. She established her healing home on five beautiful acres located in Lithonia, Georgia, just outside Atlanta. Dr. Nancy is also a motivational speaker, educator, and author.  In addition, she hosts her own radio show on Love860, Mondays and Wednesdays from 2pm – 3pm.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">“I’ve seen people go from sickness, depression, stress, frustration, and a lack of finances to a life of joy, peace, happiness, and prosperity,” Dr. Nancy says. “It’s very fulfilling to see that transformation take place. People are created for greatness. As long as there is breath in their lungs, it’s never too late to change what they’re doing and make a difference in their lives and the lives of others.”   Visit Dr. Nancy J. Williams at <a href="http://www.drnancyjwilliams.com/">www.drnancyjwilliams.com</a> or contact her at 770-484-4745.</p>

<p>Women business owners are the key to the economic success of our country. On October 7th 2011, <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em> hosted their 2nd Annual Business Superstars’ Awards Breakfast. This  awards breakfast is dedicated to shining the spotlight on ALL women  business owners, celebrating their brilliance and recognizing their  humanitarian contributions to society.</p>
<p>Managing Director, president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation and  global head of Corporate Engagement has stated that “Ninety percent of  all revenues that women gain in their enterprises are reinvested into  society, into educating their children, into healthcare programs … it’s a  very interesting moment in this issue of investing in women and in  women’s empowerment globally.”</p>
<p>At <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em>, we feel honored to be  in a position to help women get more exposure in the marketplace,  thereby making a positive impact on their business success.</p>
<p>We’d like to thank all of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.259774087393663.57778.102559713115102&amp;type=3">attendees</a> who came out to help us celebrate this beautiful moment in time to uplift WOMEN. You are appreciated!</p>
<p>Above all else, we’d like to thank our <em>Platinum Sponsor</em>, <a href="http://www.surgicalhealthcollective.com/">Surgical Health Collective</a> for believing in the work we do and for helping us to make this event a reality!

Her presentation is entitled, <em>The POWER of Dreams!</em></p>
<p><strong>Lisa Nicole Cloud</strong> has been able to help people reach  their financial goals and dreams, including five people who became  self-made millionaires. She has also helped dozens to earn five-figure  monthly incomes. Lisa’s secret: It’s all about the attitude.</p>
<p><strong>The path hasn’t been an easy one for Lisa.</strong> Eight  years ago, she hit a low point in her life both financially and  personally. After majoring in psychology/pre-med at Emory University and  completing the prestigious Leadership Development Program at Johns  Hopkins University, she was on the same insecure road as many Americans  today, worrying she would be downsized from her corporate job. However,  inspired by her mother who pursued many entrepreneurial ventures and was  a shining example of what was possible, Lisa didn’t give up.</p>
<p><strong>Today, Lisa is an  incredibly successful award-winning businesswoman</strong> who inspires people to  fulfill their dreams. Because of her  perseverance, positive attitude and belief that anything is possible,  Lisa has conducted several hundred high-energy leadership trainings and  sales seminars throughout the US and abroad in which she impacted and  trained thousands of representatives in the areas of Direct Sales,  Personal Development and Professional Networking. She has provided  consulting services in the areas of Marketing Strategy Development &amp;  Implementation and Organizational Development for companies in various  business sectors such as Healthcare, Sports Entertainment, Information  Systems, Pharmaceuticals, and Telecommunications, just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t let her small stature fool you, Lisa is a Little Dynamo!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dynamic, Captivating, Charismatic, Passionate, and Genuine,</strong> are often terms used to describe her. Lisa’s mission in life is to help  people identify their God-given talents so they can do more, be more,  achieve more and impact our community in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>“It’s not what happens to you in life, it’s how you respond,”</strong> Lisa boldly states. “Life is 10 percent of what happens to you and 90 percent of how you respond.</p>
<p><strong>As well as being the author of Live Your Dreams… It’s Possible,</strong> she is also a wife and a proud mother of two beautiful children who inspire her and always keep her smiling.</p>
<p><strong>There are no clouds on Lisa Nicole Cloud’s horizon.</strong> Future plans include another book, a new magazine, and a TV show. “My  hope for 2011 is to continue living my life with passion, purpose, and  power,” she states positively.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.womensuperstars.eventbrite.com"><strong>Get your tickets to the 2nd Annual 2011 Business Superstars’ Awards Breakfast</strong></a> and be inspired by Millionaire Maker, Lisa Nicole Cloud on October 7,  2011, where we will be celebrating the brilliance of all WOMEN in  business!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #333399;">-Publisher of People You Need to Know Magazine-
</span></h2>
<p><strong><img class="size-full wp-image-11259  alignleft" title="Spark Plug Speaks" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Spark-Plug-Speaks.jpg" alt="Spark Plug Speaks Spark Plug ~ Publisher of People You Need to Know Magazine" width="169" height="209" />Spark Plug’s upbeat attitude, positive outlook on life,</strong> charismatic personality, and boundless energy have all contributed to  his success in every sales arena. In 1984, while working for one of the  nation’s leading sporting goods organizations, John Smith, the  president, was so impressed with his sales ability, energy and  enthusiasm that he bestowed upon him the nickname, “Spark Plug.”  It was  a perfect match for his personality because another definition for  spark plug is “a person who inspires or energizes”– and the rest is  Spark Plug history.</p>
<p><strong>Spark Plug has sold everything from pots and pans</strong> from the trunk of his car to advertising space in business directories,  magazines and newspapers.

I’m your host, Spark  Plug, publisher of Metro Atlanta’s premier businesswomen’s spotlight  magazine. At <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em>, we’re proud to  promote women in business and give them world-class recognition along  the way. Tune in every week as we introduce you to some of the most  knowledgeable, helpful and creative businesswomen in America. Our show  today is brought to you by our new official corporate sponsor, Staples,  “That was easy.”</p>
<p>In this segment, we’re going to be talking about personal brand  leadership, what is it, and why it should be important to you. My guest  today is a native of Fayetteville, North Carolina, and a graduate of  Northwestern University. Currently, she is president of Atlanta-based  Velvet Suite Marketing Consulting Group. They are a global consulting  and leadership training company designed to empower and inspire  individuals and enterprises to be great leaders in times of change. We  are honored to have on the show today, the current <em>People You Need to Know Magazine </em>Person of the Week, Ms. Melissa Dawn Johnson. Welcome to the show.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Melissa Dawn Johnson:</span></strong> Oh, thank you. I am so excited to be here. Happy, happy Wednesday to you, how are you today?</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Spark Plug:</span></strong> Fantastic and I’m trying to get better. Melissa, are you ready to talk about personal brand leadership?</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Melissa Dawn Johnson:</strong></span> You know I’m always ready to talk about personal brand leadership. I  find that what I’ve discovered is my life’s work, so it’s very easy for  me to talk about what I love, what’s my passion and, so I’m ready.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Spark Plug: </strong></span> Well, let’s get right into it, okay?</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Melissa Dawn Johnson: </strong></span> Alright, let’s do it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Spark Plug: </strong></span> For some of our listeners, what is personal brand leadership?</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Melissa Dawn Johnson: </strong> </span>Well,  you know I think it’s very interesting because right now the word  “personal branding” is one of the hottest buzz terms, and so you hear it  from how to get more followers on Twitter, to how to get more exposure,  to how to better network to get the job, to start the business to get  the next client, and I think all of those things are great, but I really  believe and have the philosophy of <em>personal brand leadership</em>.  It is a little bit more than that. It really is about discovering your  authentic value and positioning that value consistently over time that  allows you to make choices that will ultimately make a difference for  your life and those around you and those choices are not necessarily  always easy. But it’s about leadership, it’s about positioning yourself  to be someone who is standing in character, standing in integrity, and  ultimately at this time — I think a <em>great time</em> for personal  branding leadership to happen because there’s so much going on and  people are looking for answers. There are so many problems and having  the conviction to stand up and say, “This is what I stand for –  this is  what I believe is my passion, it’s to solve someone else’s problem, and  I will go through whatever it takes. I will be a leader in order for  that to actually become true and real and ultimately make a difference  in my life and the lives of others.”</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Spark Plug:</strong></span> Well, I think you kind of answered my second question, but you might  want to take it a little bit deeper for us. Why is personal brand  leadership so important especially today?</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Melissa Dawn Johnson:</span> </strong></span>It  is critical, Spark Plug, because I believe that we’re living in a day  and age where we have more problems than we have solutions. If you look  at the economy, if you look at the environment, if you look at our  educational system, if you look at politics, if you look at the realm of  energy, there are so many.  You can watch TV, watch the nightly news,  you know I’m on CNN weekly and part of the reason why I do my segment  called, <em>Morning Motivation</em>, is to give people some inspiration and motivation to move forward in a very difficult time <em>economically</em>, and all the other factors I shared with you. And so I think why it’s so critical now is that brands are about solutions.</p>
<p>Brands are about … now, I’ll give my clarity of authentic branding  because I really believe … with my background in developing brands —  I’ve developed the brand Swiffer. I worked on Mr. Clean and Victoria’s  Secret and Nationwide. I’ve done the rebranding of Nationwide.</p>
<p>This is a part of what I’ve been educated to do, but it’s also within  my practical experience and the lessons that I’ve learned that are  practical for today that really answer that question — it’s about  authenticity. It’s about standing up and having a conviction and an  answer for a real problem that people are going through. It’s about  being able to position yourself — to be at the right place at the right  time to meet opportunity. And a lot of people need that today because  the way that we thought it would work, with the jobs that we thought we  have, with the things that we banked on in terms of our investment and  where we were going have changed. So now, we have to reposition  ourselves to meet new opportunity and we have to have persistence. I  think that’s very critical now, because it’s not easy and the reason why  in my book that I wrote, Brand Me: Make Your Mark: Turn Passion into  Profit, I talk about the passion and the profit. The passion and the  profit — you know it really is not just about, “This is what I love to  do,” but the passion gives you an ability to persevere. And more than  anything, people now need to know that they are going to have to  persevere and we’re going to get through to better times, but it’s going  to take time and the passion is going to keep you going in the  meanwhile.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Spark Plug: </strong></span>Well, Melissa, where does an individual begin in creating a personal brand?</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Melissa Dawn Johnson:</span> </strong></span> You know, it’s very easy to recognize that branding is really about the  mark that you’re making, so the truth is you already have established  the mark. The question is if it is positive or negative. And in a very  fundamental way, people usually make their mark immediately. The  statistics say within the first three seconds of someone meeting you,  they’ve made up their mind about your value and who you are, and within  the next ten seconds, they’ve changed their mind multiple times. So  you’ve got to be so proactive. We all have to be more proactive about  managing our message. What we say is less than 80% of that. Eighty  percent of that is what we do and how we show up. So it’s so important  right now to start off with the fact that, “Okay, I have value,” and I  say you’ve really got to internalize that.</p>
<p>What we talk about at Velvet Suite is branding from the inside out.  You’ve got to start with understanding what is your core value, meaning  who are you and then from there, you can brand that into the image that  people see, whether it’s how you dress, whether it’s what you talk  about, if it’s your business card, if it’s the services that you provide  in your company, if it’s how you go about working on projects on the  job, you’ve got to begin to be consistent in order for you to become  branded by the message.</p>
<p>If you think about our President, you know for 18 plus months, he  went around the country talking about “Yes, we can,” but it wasn’t until  months later after touching people in the market, after being on media,  after consistently giving his message over and over and over again that  that message branded him. So we all have to be more intentional. We’ve  got to understand who we are, package our message, be consistent in the  image that we give and ultimately, we’ve got to deliver. If you are not  someone who can execute it, if you don’t do what you say you do, you  lose all credibility no matter what you look like and no matter how you  package your message.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Spark Plug:</span> </strong></span> Well, how does a person reinvent their brand?</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Melissa Dawn Johnson:</strong></span> You know, I think many people are in the process of reinvention. I mean  from my personal story, that’s really what happened to me.  I had the  education and worked at like over five different global brands, Fortune  500 brands, all in branding, brand development and communication. And I  had a situation that happened to me in my life that really had me put my  life on pause. It’s one of those defining moments. I had a tragic loss  and I said, “You know what, really, what is life going to mean for me?   What’s my purpose?” And I didn’t want to just be defined by a great job,  and I had many accolades and a great resume. That’s all fine and good,  but really I said, “I want to understand a deeper purpose in my work,”  and I really reinvented myself as an entrepreneur. I did what I needed  to do. I did my homework, that’s one of the principles.</p>
<p>Number one, I think, before you even do your homework is you’ve got  to really ask yourself some tough questions, “Is what I’m doing  counting? Does it matter? Am I fulfilled? Am I financially fulfilled?”  And what I preach and what I talk about is that you can make a living  doing what you love, but it takes some thoughtful strategic direction.  It takes getting advice and counsel from others.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Spark Plug: </strong></span> Well, Melissa, before we bring this interview to a close, where can we  find more information all about you, your book, when you’re on CNN, your  company, and more importantly how can you be reached?</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Melissa Dawn Johnson:</strong></span> Absolutely. Velvet Suite Marketing was my first company that I launched  in 2006 and you can find out about us on the Internet at <a href="http://www.velvetsuite.com/">velvetsuite.com</a>.  That’s for established companies and established individuals where we  do full service brands, consultation and marketing execution. And then  my Reinvention was after I wrote the book, Brand Me, I realized that it  didn’t matter if you are CEO, if you’re a clerk, if you are a student,  if you are an entrepreneur or someone in between, everyone wanted to  know how to build an authentic brand. And Myles Monroe wrote the  foreword to my book.  He said, “Melissa gives what companies pay  millions for and she gives it to the masses.” And so I began to see the  opportunity for a second business called, Brand Me International. And  that is <a href="http://www.brandmelive.com/">brandmelive.com</a>.  We have a social network community. We feature expert bloggers in  different areas. We’re going to hopefully get Spark Plug on our radio  show that happens on Wednesdays on Blog Talk at noon.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>Spark Plug: </strong></span> Alright, well, Ms. Melissa Dawn Johnson, President of Atlanta-based  Velvet Suite Marketing Group. Thanks for spending some of your most  valuable time with us today.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Melissa Dawn Johnson:</strong></span> No, thank you so much for the opportunity and I wanted to just say  congratulations to you for what you are doing, and the difference you’re  making in featuring women who are changing things right now because we <em>are</em> making moves and we’re doing great things and it’s because of you that we get to let the world know what we do, so thank you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-10290 alignleft" title="Be-Ready-for-Change" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Be-Ready-for-Change.jpg" alt="Be Ready for Change Change: The Key to Growing, Evolving &amp; Reaching Our Full Potential" width="332" height="230" />Very few people actually love the element of change. It breaks up the  monotony of life, causing us to slow down and pay close attention to  what is going on in our surroundings. Life’s shifts will often bring  unease and unrest to the lives of many.</p>
<p>In business, change is definitely a fact of life. Today’s climate may  have an employee working in the office today, but that same employee  may be terminated tomorrow. Long gone are the days when corporations <em>expected</em> to keep an employee for years on end. That time has passed.</p>
<p>Most people know that even if they <em>are</em> employed, they must  work as the CEO of their own life because there are no guarantees and  they must be prepared for whatever comes their way.</p>
<p>When faced with change, our first response is usually resistance. We  do this by fight or flight. Just tell your team members that something  new is coming down the pipeline, and you’ll probably hear 10 reasons why  the change should not take place. On the other hand, in extreme  situations, people have been known to exercise the flight response and  clean out their office on the very same day a new administration takes  charge because they are not willing to deal with certain new changes that might occur.</p>
<p>Change can be a bridge to something better and more exciting. It can  also lead you down a path that really wasn’t your choice; nevertheless,  you should still be on the lookout for opportunities along the way.</p>
<p>We are more flexible than we realize and I believe that without  change, none of us could ever reach our full potential. So embrace  change, and be willing to get uncomfortable in order to keep growing,  changing and evolving.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-9889  alignright" title="People You Need to Know " src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/People-You-Need-to-Know-Turner-Chapel-Expo.jpg" alt="" width="319" height="311" /><strong>Not many men are willing to say that WOMEN </strong>are smarter than men, but <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em> (PYNTK) publisher, Anthony “Spark Plug” Thomas, isn’t one of them. His business magazine shines the spotlight on the education, talent, beauty and brilliance of women.</p>
<p><strong>“After working with women in professional settings</strong> for more than 25 years, I’ve found women are smarter than men,” he says without apology. “They are better leaders, better team players, more creative, better listeners, more willing to work for the greater good, and more likely to share their wealth, time, knowledge, information, and ideas. In addition, women are using their <em>female advantage</em> to create millions of jobs.”</p>
<p><strong>For anyone who contests Spark Plug’s point of view,</strong> good luck. Statistics convincingly back him up. According to Forbes.com, women are America’s new job-creating power force. There are 9.1 million women-owned businesses which employ 27.1 million people and contribute an astounding 3.6 trillion dollars to the U.S. economy. According to The Center for Women’s Business Research, the Metro Atlanta area alone has 185,313 women-owned businesses which collectively generate 39 billion dollars in revenues annually. The National Association of Women Owned Businesses (NAWBO) found that in spite of the recession, women-owned businesses continue to grow in Georgia.  For Spark Plug, these compelling numbers are an indication that the 21<sup>st</sup> Century woman is on a momentous rise to the top and determined to uplift others along her way. She is showing and proving her worth in this male-dominated society in an undeniable way.</p>
<p><strong>Spark Plug says, “One reason I believe most men are slow to </strong>recognize a woman’s true worth is because of their deep-seated insecurities and fear that it will somehow take away from their own power.” This concept is one which he elaborates on in his new speech entitled, “A Woman’s Worth: <em>What Men are</em> <em>Afraid to Admit They Know About Women.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Spark Plug believes “Men of influence should do everything </strong>in their power to give women the recognition they so richly deserve,” which is why his publication, <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em>, is Metro Atlanta’s premier business spotlight magazine for women. Their yearly circulation of 500,000 highlights women business owners and professionals, giving them the kind of exposure that is typically reserved for Hollywood celebrities and Fortune 500 CEOs. The support is something that women business owners really appreciate in metro Atlanta, where women are starting more businesses than ever before.</p>
<p><strong>Entrepreneur and Atlanta Business Celebrity, Stormy Wellington,</strong> is one of those women who is thankful for the magazine and Spark Plug’s assistance. “You can&#8217;t even imagine how much you have helped me to build my business,” said Stormy on Spark Plug Radio. “And women, if you are out there as entrepreneurs, you definitely want to get with Spark Plug because he will take your business to a new level.”</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;Spark Plug and the People You Need to Know Network</strong> is an amazing vehicle to promote your business and market your brand,” agrees new client, Taunya A. Lowe, PhD, owner of The Resurgent Group of Metro Atlanta. “I was ready to take my business to the next level but wasn&#8217;t sure exactly how. The following week, I met Spark Plug and did not hesitate to get my business featured in <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em>.” Lorie Johnson, MD, President of Just For You Women’s Healthcare says, “I’ve seen my business <em>grow</em> by advertising in <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em>.”</p>
<p><strong>PYNTK is not a magazine that sells conventional advertising</strong>, it’s much more than that. Since 1993, they have offered entrepreneurs and businesswomen hope, inspiration, opportunities, credibility, trust, and most importantly, recognition. Spark Plug’s favorite quote and the driving force behind his magazine is, <em>“When women succeed, the nation prospers.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Spark Plug was inspired to support businesswomen</strong> because of the positive influence women have had in his life. “My wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, sister, aunts, have all been a positive influence in my life,” he says. “I am a better man today because of them. I honor women business owners as a way to say “thank you” to all the women, past and present, who have helped me on my journey.”</p>
<p><strong>Spark Plug is a member of the Atlanta Press Club and won “Best Promoter”</strong> at the New America Media Conference and has been the recipient of the Phoenix Award, Atlanta’s most prestigious honor for community service. He is also a US Navy Veteran, author, radio talk show host, motivational speaker, and world traveler. <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em> can be found in the metro Atlanta area at Kroger, QuickTrip, Whole Foods stores and <a href="http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1qj5y/PeopleYouNeedtoKnowM/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sparkplugpeople.com%2Fadvertise%2F">online</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-full wp-image-10908   alignleft" title="India.Arie" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/India.Arie_.jpg" alt="India.Arie  Why the World Will Always Need Music ~ Tracey Roper" width="304" height="289" /><strong>We human beings are emotional creatures.</strong> We are  moved by creativity, and we have the inherent drive to be creative  ourselves. We are instinctually drawn to rhythm. The measures and the  melodies we prefer might differ, but our fascination with them is  universal. Before we ever draw our first breath of air, we are soothed  by the rhythmic sound of our mother’s heartbeat while inside the womb.  Practically every person we may come across will have their favorite  music that inspires them, but we would be hard pressed to find someone  with the capacity to hear and feel it, who does not enjoy any form of  music at all.</p>
<p><strong>How bland and dull life would be without music.</strong> It  is a phenomenon that is able to powerfully stir our emotions. It impacts  us on numerous levels; emotionally, socially, spiritually and  physiologically. It is quite amazing how something that cannot be seen  or physically grasped can have such a profound impact on our senses.  Like the wind that rustles the leaves on a tree, music resonates with  the fabric of humanity and compels us to pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>It is an increasingly evident fact that music significantly</strong> contributes towards mental and emotional well-being. It is used in  psychotherapy and psychiatry to restore balance and calm to  psychological conditions that disrupt our body’s natural equilibrium. It  is able to soothe and calm, and bring about restoration in facets of  life that no surgeon’s scalpel can reach. Listening to our favorite  songs transports us back to memorable moments in our lives . . . moments  that define our experience and even our identity to a degree. The song  to which lovers first danced. The track that was playing when we were  first kissed. The lullaby our mother or father sang to us as we fell  asleep cradled safely in their arms. Just imagine our favorite movies  without their accompanying soundtrack . . . how robbed of energy and  feeling they would be. Birds without song, lyrics without melody . . .  it all makes for a very depressing picture.</p>
<p><strong>Music is integral in helping us identify</strong> our  personal social niche. It helps us form bonds and relationships with  those who share our tastes and interests, thereby inspiring community  and a sense of belonging. It documents the progression of shifts in  culture and society, and is itself in a constant state of evolution as  old sounds and technologies are blended with new ones, steadily  reshaping the present and catapulting us towards the future. There is  also an increasing degree to which music influences other disciplines  like cinema, fashion and art . . . even politics. The civil rights  movement in America and the rebellion against the apartheid regime in  South Africa are just two examples of profound cultural, social and  political chapters in world history in which music gave voice and  expression to the laments of the downtrodden. It strengthens, motivates  and comforts.</p>
<p><strong>As long as the human being experiences</strong> feelings and  emotions that need expression, music will be a crucial component of  giving voice to those sentiments. There are those who believe that music  is the result of heaven kissing earth, and that it is one of the  supernatural and eternal gifts that we carry with us from this life into  the next.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft" title="NancyLewis-PeopleYouNeedtoKnowinAtlanta.jpg" src="http://myideas1.podbean.com/mf/web/issd64/NancyLewis-PeopleYouNeedtoKnowinAtlanta.jpg" border="0" alt="NancyLewis-PeopleYouNeedtoKnowinAtlanta.jpg" width="328" height="246" /><strong>When women gather together to talk about business</strong>,  you’d better believe there will be excitement in the air and you will  leave with some valuable information that can be applied  immediately.</p>
<p>Once again, this held true on June 3, 2011. <a href="http://www.clubcorp.com/Clubs/Commerce-Club-Atlanta">The Commerce Club</a>,  Atlanta’s elegant and stylish meeting place for people who are making  things happen in the metro area was the site for the quarterly  Transforming Women Entrepreneurs (TWE) symposium presented by Progressive Techniques, Inc.</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Lewis, (pictured above) the Founder of TWE</strong> and the President of <a href="http://www.progressivetechniquesinc.com/">Progressive Techniques, Inc., </a>was the host of this much-anticipated and inspiring quarterly event, <em>especially</em> designed to help women entrepreneurs succeed. Nancy is one of the newest members of the <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em> Network of first-class women-owned businesses in metro Atlanta. Her  company, Progressive Techniques Inc., is a leader in “Developing a  Better You” and her A-list clients such as Delta Airlines, AT&amp;T,  Chick-fil-A and many more, rave about her energetic, uplifting and  inspiring presentations. Nancy Lewis is a leading  motivational/inspirational speaker, trainer, business coach and author.  She is well-connected and immensely respected in the metro Atlanta  business community.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-10823   alignright" title="Transforming Women Event" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Transforming-Women-Event.jpg" alt="Transforming Women Event Transforming Women Entrepreneurs Event Focuses on Marketing" width="368" height="116" /></p>
<p><strong>At <a href="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com"><em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em></a></strong><a href="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com">,</a> we  were honored to be a media partner at this phenomenal event. The topic  for the morning was “Leveraging Sales &amp; Marketing for Profitability  and Business Success.”</p>
<p><strong>The program began promptly at 8:30am</strong> with Nancy  Lewis welcoming and thanking everyone for coming out to the TWE  quarterly meeting. She also gave special recognition to her sponsors for  supporting her in her efforts to make a difference in the lives of  women entrepreneurs.</p>
<p><strong>At 8:50am, a delicious classic plated American</strong> breakfast was served to the esteemed guests and at 9:25am, Nancy  introduced one of Atlanta’s favorite personalities, Ms. Tawanda Black,  Director of Community Affairs for KISS 104.1 FM in Atlanta. Ms. Black  took over as the moderator for the rest of the program. She did an  outstanding job introducing the panelists and keeping the program moving  along smoothly.</p>
<p><strong>The first panelist to be introduced was Shani T. Godwin,</strong> President of <a href="http://www.communique-usa.com/Who-We-Are/Default.aspx">Communiqué</a>.  Her company offers Strategic Marketing for growing businesses. Shani  spoke about “Building Brand Equity.” She believes that building a brand  is the same as building any long-term investment. Ms. Godwin pointed out  that you should never compromise your brand, and that consistency is  essential to your brand building success.</p>
<p><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-10828" title="TWE - Transforming Women Entrepreneurs" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/TWE-Transforming-Women-Entrepreneurs.jpg" alt="TWE Transforming Women Entrepreneurs Transforming Women Entrepreneurs Event Focuses on Marketing" width="288" height="216" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>Shani shared her list of low-cost ways to <em>invest</em> </strong>in  your brand. First, she suggested that when it comes to your brand, you  must be consistent with your colors. If your colors are red and white,  be sure to stay consistent with everything you do in your branding  efforts. Secondly, have key messages that build upon your brand’s  strength. Third, make sure<em> everyone </em>in your organization speaks with a <em>united voice</em> about your product or service. Fourth, create messages that <em>resonate</em> with your audience. Fifth, create brand guidelines. Sixth, ask yourself  — who do you want to be in the future? Seventh, understand that you  don’t have to be everything to all people. Eighth, create marketing  materials that have the <em>same</em> look and feel. And last but not least, know who you are when it comes to your brand.</p>
<p><strong>The second panelist to be introduced</strong> was Marilynn Mobley, Senior Vice President/Strategic Counsel at <a href="http://www.edelman.com/">Edelman</a>,  the world’s largest PR Firm. Edelman has 3,600 employees in 53 offices  worldwide. They were named Adverting Age’s PR Firm of the decade.  Marilynn talked about “What it Takes to<em> Get the PR</em> to <em>Get You What You Want</em>.” She said that after all is said and done, what people really want more than anything else in business is <em>significance</em>.  People want to feel like they really do matter. She encouraged the  attendees to be thought leaders. Marilynn did a great job of revealing  to the group what the media outlets ultimately want . . . which is, what  can you contribute that will make them look really smart? The media,  she says, are more interested in helping their readers and viewers, and  not just you. Her remarkable insight into the PR world was very  informative.</p>
<p><strong>Marilynn believes that media is merging and converging; furthermore, </strong>as  a result of this new paradigm that we are experiencing today, reporters  are looking for reliable sources who know what the trends are, who  understand that as <em>thought leaders</em> you must stay in front of  reporters because they are very busy, and they are also looking for  people who embrace the power of social media. Reporters are getting  their sources online at sites like Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, and  more, she noted. She told the attendees to think of themselves as a  resource for clients and media. When it comes to your industry, Marilynn  says that you should find out who covers it, and who <em>writes </em>about  your industry and subject matter. In addition, find out what’s  interesting to a reporter and figure out how you can be of service to  them. In closing, she suggested to the attendees that they follow the  media as well as pay attention to <em>how</em> the media is changing.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-10825  alignleft" title="TWE" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/TWE.jpg" alt="TWE Transforming Women Entrepreneurs Event Focuses on Marketing" width="372" height="201" /></p>
<p><strong>The final panelist to be introduced was Tamiko Leverette, MPA,</strong> President, <a href="http://www.nonprofitdreams.com/">Nonprofit Dreams, LLC</a>.  Ms. Leverette also produces a weekly television show called Dreams Are  Not For Profit. Tamiko’s presentation was about how for-profit  businesses can work with non-profits to save on their marketing. She  said business owners should find non-profits to work with or start one  of their own. Furthermore, her past experience with non-profits taught  her that there are great opportunities for marketing partnerships and a  chance to save money and support your community at the same time. It’s a  win-win for the non-profit and the business owner because the  non-profit gets much needed financial assistance and the tax benefit is <em>great</em> for the business owner because they can write-off the financial contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Ms. Leverette noted that <em>Cause-Related Marketing</em> </strong>is  always great for business. What Cause-Related Marketing does is let  people know that your organization supports a particular cause such as  Habitat for Humanity or the United Way. Tamiko encouraged the audience  members to partner with non-profits in their small business marketing  efforts because they may have the additional resources that <em>your</em> small business may not have, especially during these unstable economic times.</p>
<p><strong>A memorable quote she shared with the attendees</strong> was,<em> “The non-profits’ mission is not to make money, but that is not to say they<strong> can’t </strong>make money.”</em> Tamiko stated that there are 65,000 non-profits in the state of  Georgia, and when deciding to partner with a non-profit, it is extremely  important to <em>target</em> groups you’re trying to reach. For instance, If you’re trying to reach teachers, target non-profits that work with teachers.</p>
<p><strong>In closing, she said when it comes to non-profit partnerships,</strong> most for-profit business owners really need to take a closer look at how this relationship could really help <em>grow</em> their business.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-10851 alignright" title="TWE - Sebrena Sumrah-Kelly" src="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/TWE-Sebrena-Sumrah-Kelly.jpg" alt="TWE Sebrena Sumrah Kelly Transforming Women Entrepreneurs Event Focuses on Marketing" width="298" height="223" /></p>
<p><strong>At the end of the panel presentations,</strong> the audience  members were given the opportunity to ask the panelists a few questions.  And after the question and answer session came to a close, it was time  for the door prizes to be given away. Nancy Lewis picked the lucky  winners of the door prizes by drawing names on business cards from a  basket. All sorts of prizes were given away, from make-overs, coaching  sessions, gift-bags, books, skin care products and more.</p>
<p><strong>As usual, our <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em></strong> display table was set-up and ready to welcome all who stopped by to  visit with us. One of the first people to stop by our table to say hello  was Ms. Sebrena Sumrah-Kelly, (pictured left) President of <a href="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/business/events/grow-your-business-with-caribbean-and-american-business-connections/">Caribbean-American Business Connections</a>. Sebrena is one of the newest members of the <em>People You Need to Know Magazine</em> Network of first-class women-owned businesses in metro Atlanta. She will be featured in our upcoming <em>Leading Ladies in Business</em> edition. At the end of the program, many of the attendees stayed around  for awhile to network/make new business contacts, and several wanted to  find out more about our magazine.</p>
<p><em>We’d like to give special recognition to a few people whom we had the pleasure of meeting at the event …</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Joanne W. Trawick, Beauty Consultant/President-Aularale Skin Care &amp; Cosmetics</li>

<p><em>Photograph: Marco Longari/AFP/Getty Images </em>

</p><p>As we enter the month of February, a month dedicated to the remembrance of our pilgrimage from being enslaved in the land of the FREE &#8230; a pilgrimage that still has open wounds &#8230; wounds that have been<em> hard</em> to heal &#8230; we cannot afford to turn our heads or close our eyes to what is happening in Egypt. The piercing words which Dr. Martin Luther King wrote in his <em>Letter from the Birmingham Jail</em> are still warm and will never grow cold. He reminded us that &#8220;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.&#8221;</p>
<p>We cannot turn away from the horror we&#8217;ve witnessed in Egypt. Blood-soaked clothing of people on the streets, screams of those who are injured and in excruciating pain, those wrapped in sheets in the morgues, or the thousands upon thousands camped out, calling for their 30 year iron-fist leader, Hosni Mubarak, to &#8220;LEAVE NOW&#8221; are all etched in our memory. We cannot deafen our ears to these familiar voices. The voices of those who are &#8230; tired of being oppressed &#8230; tired of police brutality and corruption, tired of not being able to feed their families because of a lack of employment &#8230; these voices cannot be silenced. Even when employed, the wages received are barely enough to survive because of the rising prices of food and other living expenses. A man&#8217;s dignity is linked to being able to adequately support his family.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, virtually all Internet access was shut down, temporarily interrupting the protestors&#8217; freedom of speech so the rest of the world could not witness what was happening.</p>
<p>Our fate remains intertwined. There will always be people in power who claim to love their country, but not love ALL of the people in it. To me, this is an oxymoron because what is a country without the PEOPLE? And what is the point of having a ruler if there are no people? Furthermore, what kind of love leaves people struggling from day to day without having access to equal opportunities?</p>
<p>As you view these videos, and many others on YouTube, remember &#8230; the thread of humanity does not have any breaks in it, we are all tied together as ONE.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=235394">The Tehran Times</a> reported, &#8220;According to Nasrallah (Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah) the world is witnessing a real, patriotic, and popular Egyptian revolution in which Muslims and Christians are participating as well as various movements.&#8221; Nasrallah said “In this revolution, all Egyptians are taking part, including children, women, men, intellectuals, scholars, workers. But the major and strongest element in this revolution remains the youth generation. That’s why we can say that we’re before a complete revolution.”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Egypt reminds us that when people grow weary of being oppressed, abused, and denied basic human rights, they will eventually come together, rise up and rebel out of desperation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Egypt <em>is not</em> far away. The people are not far away. Egypt is in our homes via television and newspapers. Egypt is in our hands via technology. Some of us have relatives in Egypt and for many of us, Egypt will remain in our hearts because of our common humanity.</p>

Whatever your dreams may be, I hope you can keep your heart in the mix, for it is then that your joy will spring forth and be as refreshing as water on dry desert sand.

<p>So . . . as you break open this new package, this new marker of time that is given to us, I hope you follow your heart and find joy along the path. Most of all, may you never lose the desire to share your joy with someone else.  As the seconds, minutes and days continue to zoom by, please remember, you hold the key to your own happiness. Believe it.</p>

But taking a moment to assess your tax situation <strong>NOW</strong> could pay off big in 2010. Here are some year-end tax tips that could drastically change your tax situation.</p>
<p>Tips for Business Owners:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Get Current</strong>.</span> One of the most important tax tips I can give is to make sure your accounting is up-to-date. It is important that you have a complete understanding of your financial situation. Scheduling a year-end planning session with your accountant is a good idea and a good start.</li>
<p></p>
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Procrastinate</strong>. </span>I know this may sound crazy, but hear me out. If (and only if) your cash flow can sustain it, then wait until January to bill those end of the year clients. Any cash you receive in December must be included on your 2009 tax return as income, but if you wait just a few more days you can defer payment of taxes on that income for another year.</li>
<p></p>
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Shop ‘til you drop</strong>.</span> Purchase items that your business will need in the near future. Again this is if your cash flow permits. Some things you should consider are office supplies, equipment purchases or pay some bills early (i.e. business cell phone bill, utilities, etc).<em> This year the sales tax and excise tax charged on qualified motor vehicle purchases is deductible.  So if you are in need of a new vehicle, it would be beneficial to do so by year end</em>.</li>
<p></p>
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>More blessed to give</strong>.</span> We’ve all heard the saying, “it’s more blessed to give than to receive”. And it’s true in more ways than one. Push an early 2010 charitable donation back to 2009, which allows you to take the deduction in 2010 instead of waiting until 2011. Be sure you get a receipt to support the tax deduction.</li>
<p></p>
<li><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Sock it Away</strong>.</span> This is a great time to make payments to your retirement plan or setup one to reduce your business income before the year ends. Meet with your financial planner to verify the contribution limits and deadlines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips for Individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Job-related moving expenses</li>
<li>Job-skill improvement classes (including travel)</li>
<li>Professional and investment publications</li>
<li>Union or professional dues</li>
<li>Job-hunting expenses (including travel)</li>
<li>Child care expenses</li>
<li>Home office deduction – working from a home-office</li>
<li>New or used clothes, toys, and household goods given to charity</li>
<li>Fees for tax or investment advice and tax return preparation</li>
<li>IRA fees</li>
<li>Client gifts</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: These year-end tips will apply differently to each individual’s situation and accounting method. Seek professional advice to determine the best strategy for your transactions for tax purposes.</em>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Who is going to know </strong>that your business exists unless YOU tell them about it, render the type of service and quality to get others talking about it or pay someone else to get the word out for you? And the <em>quickest</em> way to do that is to invest - yes, invest - in <a href="http://adage.com/">advertising</a>.</p>
<p><strong>But where should you </strong><a href="http://www.sparkplugpeople.com/">advertise</a> and how much of it should you do? How much should you spend? How often should you advertise? What form should it take?</p>
<p><strong>Lots of questions.</strong> Let’s look at some of the answers. And please note: Every advertising plan is unique, so these answers are just possibilities - suggestions - and should not be construed as YOUR plan. You will need to investigate the possibilities for your product and your target market and come up with your own plan before you begin.</p>
<p><strong>Where you advertise</strong> depends on your type of business and the area you want to cover. You might choose local magazines and newspapers, or publications that are distributed free at local supermarkets and other retail and private outlets. You might also consider radio spots or press releases to augment print ads, try online videos, banners, etc., take the plunge into social media or sponsor events in your community.</p>
<p><strong>We’ve already established </strong>that advertising is essential to identifying you as a player in your market. How much advertising you do depends on your budget. You must decide how much you can afford in order to get your name out. Since advertising is an investment, you will need to put a pencil to your finances to determine how much you can spend. Once you’ve established an advertising budget, begin by contacting potential advertising outlets. Ask what they charge for various ad sizes. Ask about circulation numbers and deadlines for placement. Print ads will be priced by ad size, circulation numbers and, sometimes, the location of the ad within the publication. Keep in mind that ads usually cost more if they run in color.</p>
<p><strong>Radio ads are generally sold</strong> as packages - a certain number of ads of a certain length played in certain or various time slots - for a package amount. Because their advertising rates are audience driven, radio stations charge more for what is called “drive time” - the hours in the morning and afternoon when a lot of people are commuting to and from work.</p>
<p><strong>Before you commit to a radio package,</strong> be sure to ask each station how many listeners they report for various times of day. Also, smaller stations charge less than larger ones because they generally have smaller audiences. Research the size of the stations and the audiences they tend to attract. For example, if your product is aimed at people between the ages of 15 and 24, you will want to choose stations with programming that attracts that age group.</p>
<p><strong>You can also consider television</strong> advertising. However, television advertising is more expensive and requires you to produce a commercial. This production will add to your upfront cost. Like radio, television advertising is priced by ad length and the time of day the ads are played. In addition, it is vitally important that any ad you produce looks very professional. It is tempting to think you can reach a large audience through TV, but if you produce an unprofessional ad, the audience will know and the result will be negative rather than positive for you.</p>
<p><strong>In all cases we’ve talked about,</strong> you will have to supply words that describe your product, business or offer. Of course you won’t need art for radio, but you will need top-notch professional art and/or video for print or television advertising. You will incur an additional cost to produce that art - either through the publication/TV station or another source.</p>
<p><strong>The bottom line is</strong> getting other people to say your name in as many ways as possible to make your “Brand” stick and bring more business to your door! No advertising method is outdated. As long as you can capture the attention of an audience and get them to respond, you have succeeded. As a matter of fact, depending on the service offered, people are still able to get my business using flyers.

		<title>eBay Craze: Taxable or Not? - Bernadette Johnson-Hairl</title>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="BernadetteJohnson-HairlPodcast.jpg" src="http://myideas1.podbean.com/mf/web/5ejfjn/BernadetteJohnson-HairlPodcast.jpg" border="0" alt="BernadetteJohnson-HairlPodcast.jpg" width="288" height="347" /><strong>If you are anything like me,</strong> you love eBay! At one point in my life, I was hooked on eBay. In fact, I was on a first name basis with the UPS carrier. I&#8217;ve bought brand new shoes, leather coats and even textbooks on eBay! My ten year old daughter even makes her way to the site every now and then to “check-out” the deals. But I’m not just an online shopper; I&#8217;ve also had some luck in unloading an item or two. It beats having a garage sale and hoping someone will show up. We all have something better to do with our Saturdays.</p>
<p><strong>eBay and other online auction sites</strong> are still today’s hottest trends. And if you&#8217;re like me and many other Americans, you may have caught the <em>online auction</em> bug. Whether you are posting unwanted items from your attic or basement or have intentions of becoming a virtual entrepreneur, you should be aware of the tax rules that apply to your sales proceeds.</p>
<p><strong>So I’m sure you are asking,</strong> what’s the deal? Is it taxable or not? Well, the old baby furniture or the unused treadmill generally do not have any tax consequences. In these cases, the amounts you receive for these items are generally less than what you paid for them so there’s no gain on the sale. The most you get out of the sale is cash to buy more junk and a little more space in your garage. And that, my friend, is not taxable!</p>
<p><strong>If the items you are unloading </strong>are considered an antique or collectible item, then a different set of rules are applicable. In this case, you generally will receive more for the item than what you paid for it, creating a gain on the sale. The tax treatment on this sale will depend on whether or not you’ve had the items for a year or more. The general rule of having the item for less than a year deems it as a short-term gain and is taxed at your ordinary income rate. However, if you’ve had the item for a year or more, then it’s considered a long-term gain and you may be eligible for favorable tax rates.</p>
<p><strong>So if you have made any online sales</strong> or are considering such sales we will be happy to advise you on the proper handling of your transactions for tax purposes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="TraditionalMarketing.jpg" src="http://myideas1.podbean.com/mf/web/yjca5q/TraditionalMarketing.jpg" border="0" alt="TraditionalMarketing.jpg" width="288" height="151" /><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Recently, I came across a blog article</strong> </span>about how social media marketing can recession-proof your business. Interesting, I thought. All I have to do is join the social media bandwagon and my business will be sure to grow despite the economical issues surrounding all other businesses on the planet. Well, I just had to read further.</p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><span>As I read the blog article,</span> </strong></span>I found that the content didn&#8217;t really tell me what I thought it would. It merely gave two steps to take to get involved in the social media landscape.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>First, monitor what is being said about you</strong> </span>and second, begin networking - online. What the article failed to mention, however, is that social media alone is not the final word in marketing these days. It&#8217;s not the ONLY way to market either. Social media should be used as a companion method of marketing alongside your traditional marketing mediums such as newspaper ads, print mailers, phone book, flyers, joining the Chamber of Commerce, participating in face-to-face networking/leads groups. And if you have the money, advertising on the radio and TV is still a great medium.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>I guess I had a few moments of time on my hands</strong> </span>so I began reading some of the comments. One comment was from a young gentleman - now I have no way to know if he was young or not, however, his many posts made me believe that he was not only young, but a very naive entrepreneur. One of the posts made was regarding advertising in the phone book. This young man&#8217;s comment was something like, &#8220;Do they still print the phone book?&#8221;</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>My response to him was this:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>I agree that so many more people are using social media</strong></span><span style="color: #333399;"> </span>to make connections and market their business - however - print marketing is not dead. There are still people around the country who don&#8217;t even have a computer - much less an Internet connection. I know it might be hard for the younger GEN X and GEN Y Generations to understand that, but it is true.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>And even if they are hooked up, not everyone has joined </strong></span>the Social Media Revolution. My 28 year son in law doesn&#8217;t have a clue about Facebook, Twitter, blogging, etc. It&#8217;s just not something which interests him. He&#8217;s actually the only one in the house who DOES use the phone book!</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><span>That said&#8230;.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong><span>When marketing via social media we must NOT </span></strong></span>forget that we still need to integrate the traditional marketing/advertising mediums. And if it means joining your local Chamber of Commerce and face-to-face networking groups, or even advertise in that big yellow book, then that&#8217;s just what we need to do.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>Just like each individual needs to be well-rounded</strong></span><span style="color: #333399;"> </span>in their lives - personal and business - the way we make business connections and build relationships need to be well-rounded as well.</p>
<p><span style="color: #333399;"><strong>When planning your marketing campaign - add in</strong></span> as many of the elements you can and then you will experience the growth you are seeking. Don&#8217;t overlook the traditional mediums of communicating with your prospective customers. You just might be overlooking a goldmine&#8230;and you&#8217;ll never know it because your competition - who understands diversifying - will sign him on.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://twitter.com/pyntk"><img class="alignright" title="twitterbutton.jpg" src="http://myideas1.podbean.com/mf/web/77z85a/twitterbutton.jpg" border="0" alt="twitterbutton.jpg" width="175" height="81" /></a>If you had told me a few months ago that I would be stuck on <a href="http://twitter.com/PYNTK">Twitter</a>, I would  have told you that you were definitely reading me wrong. But over the past few weeks, I’ve really been enjoying  this micro-blogging service and its benefits. Yes, I’m a Twitter Fan.</p>
<p>So who&#8217;s responsible for my new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">micro-blogging</a> adventure? The credit goes to <a href="http://twitter.com/AYellowHouse">@AYellowHouse.</a> I was very hesitant about joining, but Dori convinced me to jump in and give it a try. So…a couple of months later, I gathered up the courage to take the plunge and I’ve become a better person because of it. The people who have helped me grow are too numerous to mention and I&#8217;m very thankful for each and every one of them.</p>
<p>One of my favorite benefits is the fact that you can talk in real-time to <a href="http://beta.twittervision.com/">anyone in the world.</a> From authors, CEOs, activists, musicians, graphic designers, you name the profession, there’s someone you can  talk to 24 hours a day and seek advice.</p>
<p>Another great benefit it offers is that it actually helps you with your writing skills. You’ve got to be clear about what you’re writing since you only have <a href="http://140conf.com/">140 characters</a> to get your message across. I don’t have a big problem with that because I’m not a big talker so that part was rather easy.</p>
<p>To help us become more comfortable with Twitter, Corvida Raven (<a href="http://twitter.com/corvida">@corvida</a>), was gracious enough to be our guest on <a href="http://tiny.cc/rvcqE ">Spark Plug Radio.</a> She gave us the goods on Twitter basics. Her interview basically answered the question…What’s the Big Deal About Twitter? After her interview, it didn’t seem so overwhelming but a very simple concept indeed.</p>
<p>To me, Twitter is similar to a <a href="http://www.vladimirpetkovic.com/blog/category/design/">Lego brick</a>. It starts out very simple. However, if you keep building and building, connecting and connecting, you just never know what’s possible, but it helps to <a href="http://www.brickartist.com/large-sculptures/cello-1.html">have a plan</a>. So far, I’ve been pleased with the rewards I’ve received from my experience. Keep in mind, if you’re self-centered, only wanting to push your own agenda, you’ll get turned off very quickly because it’s all about sharing in the community.</p>
<p>Feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/PYNTK">follow us</a> on Twitter. If you haven’t joined, at least give it a try. Have fun!</p>
<p>~ Jacqueline <img src="http://www.podbean.com/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.lumaxart.com/"><img class="alignright" title="Unity.jpg" src="http://myideas1.podbean.com/mf/web/4mfhj9/Unity.jpg" border="0" alt="Unity.jpg" width="288" height="288" /></a>On September 9, 2009, Morrow police were called to the Cracker Barrel Restaurant on Southlake Plaza Drive at 7:30 p.m. It was reported that a woman had been savagely beaten by a man, 6&#8242;2&#8243;, 215 pounds.</p>
<p>Her seven-year-old daughter had chosen the Cracker Barrel Restaurant as a place for them to go and have a nice meal, but as most of us now know, they never even had a chance to sit down.</p>
<p><em>Edmund Burke once said, “The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing!”</em></p>
<p>Anthony &#8216;Spark Plug&#8217; Thomas, a local motivational speaker, and publisher of <a href="http://content.yudu.com/Library/A12wlt/PeopleYouNeedtoKnowA/resources/index.htm?referrerUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.yudu.com%2Fitem%2Fdetails%2F32944%2FPeople-You-Need-to-Know">People You Need to Know,</a> decided to do <em>something</em> and launch what he calls a day of Joy &amp; Pampering for the mother and daughter. After hearing about this in the media, he believed that the metro Atlanta business community would want to do <em>something</em> collectively to reach out to Ms. Hill and her young daughter, who was also traumatized.</p>
<p>So, he contacted several local businesses and most were eager to donate their services because they wanted to show, especially the daughter, that she still lives in a world where strangers care.</p>
<p>Ms. Shamone Green, sales manager at <a href="http://www.mtilimos.com">MTI Limo &amp; Shuttle Services </a>didn&#8217;t hesitate to donate two days of limousine transportation for Ms. Hill and her daughter as well as offer additional assistance.  <a href="http://www.sweetsuccesssalon.com/index.htm">Sweet Success Salon</a> volunteered to style their hair, and <a href="http://www.marykay.com">Mary Kay</a> Beauty Consultant, Atrice Baker will give the mother a complimentary facial and make-over. <a href="http://www.spasydell.com">Spa Sydell</a> in Buckhead donated a manicure and pedicure for them and the <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/atlmq-atlanta-marriott-marquis/">Atlanta Marriott Marquis</a> has given them a night of luxurious accommodations at their hotel.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fernbankmuseum.org/imax/now_showing.aspx">The Fernbank Museum of Natural History </a>is giving them tickets to their <a href="http://www.fernbankmuseum.org/imax/now_showing.aspx">IMAX® Theatre </a>as well as two free passes to the Museum. <a href="http://www.hillstone.com/#/restaurants/houstons/">Houston&#8217;s</a> Midtown restaurant on Peachtree is providing complimentary lunch or dinner for the mother and daughter. Additionally, the <a href="http://www.thrillist.com/atlanta/midtown-mediterranean-diner">Midtown Mediterranean Diner</a> is offering breakfast, lunch or dinner. Mr. Patel with <a href="http://www.brusters.com/">Bruster&#8217;s Real Ice Cream </a>in Morrow, Georgia, is giving them a gift card for free ice cream.</p>
<p>Spark Plug says, &#8220;I&#8217;m getting tired of seeing crimes being committed against women in our country and around the world. They give birth to us all and spend most of their time nurturing us in our formative years, literally holding up the world without getting the credit they so richly deserve. As men, we need to do a better job of protecting them and not hurting them.  Without women, where would this world be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this day of Joy &amp; Pampering gives Ms. Hill and her daughter something more positive to focus on for a long time.&#8221;

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="Manners.jpg" src="http://myideas1.podbean.com/mf/web/82zr96/Manners.jpg" border="0" alt="Manners.jpg" width="120" height="155" /><a href="http://www.palmbeachetiquette.com"><strong>Sherry Thomas</strong></a> is a leading Etiquette and Life Skills Expert. She credits her attention to manners to her Southern upbringing and to her wonderful mother who placed her into Etiquette classes at an early age. Coupled with her Psychology training at Clemson University, she brings real life situations to real people.</p>
<p><strong>She has worked with many</strong> people that you see on television each week in the areas of Etiquette, Public Speaking, Image Consulting, Media /Press Coaching and Life Skills. She often incorporates video into her training, affording a client the opportunity to view ‘befores’ and ‘afters’. Video, she says, is the only way for us to see ourselves <em>as the world does</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sherry believes that proper Etiquette</strong> in all areas of our lives is an integral part of how we’re perceived, thus affecting our advancement in the workplace and our overall well being. She has coined the phrase <em>Public Persona Optimization</em>, meaning that if you practice certain techniques long enough in order to maximize your public perception, eventually those techniques and changes become a natural part of who you are, thus optimizing your <em>private persona</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sherry’s clients include </strong>Corporations, new Socialites, Athletes, Children, Adults, new Graduates, people from all walks of life – all seeking to master the polish and skills required to ‘get ahead’, ’seal the deal’ or ‘make a favorable impression’. She has been featured in magazines and newspapers, on radio shows,  and has had many etiquette articles published.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Confidence without arrogance” is her favorite mantra.</em></p>
<p><strong>Sherry loves children and can often be seen</strong> in the middle of the floor with kids and teens of all ages, participating with them, instead of staring down at them.</p>
<p><strong>In addition to Etiquette, Sherry is a Writer </strong>and Video Producer, having produced Commercials, Infomercials, Corporate Video, and Elite Weddings. She is President of Breathless Video Productions. Based in South Florida, her international video company shoots anywhere in the world!</p>
<p><strong>Having been a New York City actress,</strong> she can still be found, occasionally, on the stages of South Florida, performing . . . <em>just to keep the acting blood warm</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to her interview below</strong> and learn how etiquette can help as well as hinder your progress.

In particular, she was interested in successful Latina women who have overcome obstacles to provide inspiration to others and remind them that anything is possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://powerfullatinas.com">PowerfulLatinas.com</a> launched its first project, an interview series, to compile a storehouse of wisdom from Latinas who have reached successful peaks in their lives. The project is an exciting one and geared to provide inspiration, personal growth and motivation for Latinas and others nationwide.</p>
<p>The goal is to motivate and inspire women – young, old, and everything in between– to learn from others’ life lessons.</p>
<p>Her own life story being one of inspiration, Aurelia understands what it means to overcome obstacles. After becoming pregnant at 15, she graduated from high school a year early and went immediately to college where she received her B.A. in Sociology. She received her law degree from Stanford Law School and then was awarded a post-graduate Fulbright Fellowship to study in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Aurelia has been practicing corporate law for the past ten years, first at a prominent law firm and now for a Fortune 300 company where she specializes in intellectual property.</p>
<p>As a young woman, Aurelia personally found a lack of positive role models in her life. The scope of possibilities and opportunities that were known to her was very narrow.</p>
<p>During the course of her own academic and professional life she found the lack of guidance and experience a hindrance to her at various points in her life. She believes it would have been great to have had role models to look up to.</p>
<p>Aurelia wants to offer a learning opportunity to other women who might find themselves in similar shoes. She strongly believes women can learn from other women, no matter where they are in their career or life path.</p>
<p>Aurelia volunteers for various non-profit organizations, and sits on the Board of the San Diego Museum of Art. She is a proud mother and her son now attends Georgetown University.</p>
<p>Tune in below to listen to Ms. Aurelia Flores.  She will be sharing some benefits about her life-changing organization, <a href="http://powerfullatinas.com">PowerfulLatinas.com</a>.  Her office can be reached at (858) 569-0710.

The combination of the witty and wise New Yorker teachings of her parents and the sweet, Southern hospitality of her childhood gave her the best of both worlds, and shaped her into who she is today.</p>
<p><strong>Ingrid began her college career</strong> at Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida. She completed her degree in Communications at Oglethorpe University.</p>
<p><strong>A new business owner, and founder of <em>The Party Makers</em>,</strong> Ingrid Priscilla Wiggberg is quickly making a good name for herself and her company in the metro Atlanta area.

<p><strong> Excited about taking it to the next level, </strong>Ingrid plans to follow in her mother&#8217;s footsteps by making the most of the &#8220;gift&#8221; for event planning that her mother passed on to her.</p>

<p><strong>The mission of Festival Peachtree Latino</strong> is to serve as an integrating path between Hispanic audiences and businesses, fostering development, strengthening commercial relationships, and culturally responding to the modern and traditional activities of their community.</p>
<p><strong>The first thing that is evident</strong> when arriving at Festival Peachtree Latino is its sheer size! Although a majority of visitors are Hispanic, people of all cultures attend Underground Atlanta to watch or participate in the festivities. This demonstrates that the Festival is an excellent resource to reach out to new customers. It is a great opportunity to showcase your products or services to all who attend, while enjoying a cultural experience of music, food and other exciting activities that the Festival has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Two stages featuring </strong>international performances, a parade, exhibition booths and an arts &#038; crafts showcase are held in the Underground Atlanta area. In only 5 years, Festival Peachtree Latino has become a long awaited and ever-expanding event not only for Hispanics, but for the rest of our diverse community as well. The attendance has tripled from its beginning in 2000, to the present with a record of over 80,000 visitors in 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Join us as we participate</strong> in this festive event on Sunday, August 23rd.  For more information visit the Festival Peachtree Latino <a href="http://www.festivalpeachtreelatino.com">website</a>!

<p><strong>Even though we are literally</strong> wrapped up in the age of emails, blogs, video conferencing, streaming videos, podcasts, Twitter, Facebook, etc., there are still throngs of people who prefer basic face-to-face marketing or networking instead of online social networks.</p>
<p><strong>For instance, your initial business</strong> contact with Spark Plug, publisher of People You Need to Know, would probably never be through an online social network, but <em>on the phone</em> or face-to-face.  He prefers the <em>old school</em> way of communicating.  He says it helps him get to the heart of the matter more quickly when it comes to doing business.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand,</strong> I&#8217;m ashamed to admit that I&#8217;m addicted to Twitter.  Though I enjoy events,  meeting face-to-face to do business is a last resort because I believe I can do everything I need to do online.  So, considering the various habits and  social preferences of people, there is still a large audience looking to meet primarily at Expos, conventions and other events.  The spirit at these face-to-face gatherings is inspirational, uplifting and motivational, but more than anything else, the opportunities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>As a matter of fact,</strong> we use face-to-face marketing frequently to promote the people in our network and to distribute our publications.  We probably participate in events throughout each year totaling more than 1 million people in attendance.  We have a chance to further strengthen the brand of our clients, give people a chance to ask questions, look into their eyes or invite them under the People You Need to Know tent for a chat.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of Face-to-Face Marketing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Meeting people who can use your product or service</li>
<li>Generate new clients or get referrals</li>
<li>It gives your business more credibility</li>
<li>Become more than a voice, business card, flyer in the mail or Tweet</li>
<li>A chance to really show just how professional your product is to those who are not familiar with it</li>
<li>Distribute new and updated information via one-pagers, brochures, product samples, etc.</li>
<li>Collect business cards from potential clients to contact after the event</li>
<li>Run into old friends you haven’t seen in years because you’ve been too busy working</li>
<li>And if you’re lucky, you can get your product photographed and placed in the local newspaper for even greater exposure or better yet, online!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I hope you consider doing more</strong> face-to-face marketing or networking. The experience can be priceless and the opportunities are endless. In addition, it will give you a chance to get out of the office and breathe some fresh air.

<p>I am often asked how to lose weight quickly and easily.</p>
<p>Of course no one wants to listen to a lecture on the importance of healthy eating coupled with a solid exercise routine. That would preclude the quick and easy part.</p>
<p>So in a world where two thirds of all adults are overweight or obese, and some doctors predict that we will soon see a generation with a lower life expectancy than their parents due to obesity related diseases, I&#8217;ve come up with a solution that is both quick and easy. (Drum roll, please.)</p>
<p><strong>Stop eating fried foods. (Gasp!)</strong></p>
<p>Fried foods, despite having little to no nutritional value and being loaded with fat and calories, have become an accepted indulgence in our society. So accepted that many restaurants serve fries or chips alongside every meal.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that fried foods are the number one thing that most people crave – they are salty, addictive and plentiful.</p>
<p><strong>Are Fried Foods Really That Bad?</strong></p>
<p>In a nutshell, yes, fried foods really are that bad for you.</p>
<p>Take an average potato, bake it and you have 110 calories and 0 grams of fat. Take that same potato, turn it into French fries and you have 380 calories and 18 grams of fat.</p>
<p>Frying food is the easiest way to dramatically increase the calorie and fat content. And you know that extra calories and fat end up as extra body fat.</p>
<p>Other disasters that fried foods put you at risk for include: Heart Disease, Diabetes, Clogged Arteries, High Blood Pressure, Obesity and Acne.</p>
<p>Fried foods have also been known to trigger Acid Reflux and IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). Need I say more?</p>
<p><strong>Going Fried-Free</strong></p>
<p>Giving up fried food may not be easy, though it will arguably be one of the best things you do for your health and appearance. You will lose weight and improve your health by eliminating fried food from your life.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that, like all habits, the first thirty days will be the toughest. Make things easier by staying away from situations that place you in front of a big basket of fries or plate of donuts.  Call now to get started on changing your eating habits and get fit in 90 Days. 770 719-8881

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>When Facebook first came</strong> online back in 2004, I viewed it, as I know many other people did, as a personal communication site for the college age demographic. I remember my daughter telling me about being “face-booked” by a childhood friend who had moved away, or a former classmate who had gone to college in another state.</p>
<p><strong>Due to their high accessibility </strong>and relative ease of use, more people began to utilize internet based sites to form relationships, not only for personal, but for political and business use as well. A shift was created in how people were locating, reading and sharing news, information and content. This union of sociology and technology has become known as social media. Facebook, one such social media site, has kept pace with and emerged as a global giant in this changing trend.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook is free </strong>for individuals and businesses to join. The individual user sets up a “Profile” where they can share information about themselves, become “Friends” with other users, and there is even a chat feature for real-time communication. Each time a friend posts their status, new pictures, or an item of interest, it is visible to you through the news feed function.</p>
<p><strong>Businesses can set up</strong> a Facebook “Page” which is publicly available and accessible for indexing by search engines. Businesses invite individuals to become a “Fan” of their page, and benefit from viral growth through the fan’s recommendation of the business to other friends. Through the news feed, businesses can push information out to their fan base. Any individual that is a friend of that fan, can also see the information the business distributes.</p>
<p><strong>Other ways to form relationships </strong>and promote your business on Facebook include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joining Networks which are based around a region, workplace or school;</li>
<li>Joining or creating Groups relative to your industry or niche;</li>
<li>Utilizing the Events application to broadcast an upcoming event or gathering;</li>
<li>Creating your own fun Application that friends and fans can interact with, sponsored by your company;</li>
<li>Purchasing targeted ads based on CPC or CPM basis (cost per clicks or impressions).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Like many, I originally joined</strong> Facebook to make connections with friends, past and present. I recently attended a cook out hosted by an old chum from my middle school days, and his wife. I had not seen them in 30 years! They are the people, along with another friend who I also reconnected with through Facebook, that you see with me in the picture featured at the top of this post.</p>
<p><strong>I have also made many new</strong> friends by connecting with people who have similar interests or are looking to network or cross promote. You simply cannot place a value on the importance of this type of social interaction, both personally and professionally. People want to be known and appreciated, and tend do business with people they trust.</p>
<p><strong>Companies worldwide are leveraging</strong> the power of social media sites to improve customer relationships, create interaction, and increase brand awareness. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/skittles">Skittles</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/zappos">Zappos.com</a> are two examples of companies who use their Facebook pages to actively engage with consumers. By making it a more personal experience for the user instead of an outward marketing ploy, Skittles and Zappos have earned priceless credibility and gained a very loyal fan/customer base.</p>
<p><strong>Regardless of a company’s</strong> size, product or service, creating or enhancing their online presence through social media should be an important component of their overall marketing strategy. With resounding statistics, such as the ones below, it is easy to see why Facebook has become an integral part of social media marketing campaigns for businesses large and small alike:</p>
<ul>
<li>More than 100 million users log on to Facebook each day;</li>
<li>The fastest growing user demographic is those 35 years of age and older;</li>
<li>More than 6 million users become fans of Pages each day;</li>
<li>More than 1 billion pieces of content (web links, news stories, blog posts, notes, photos, etc.) are shared each week;</li>
<li>More than 30 million active user groups exist on the site;</li>
<li>More than 50 international translations available on the site, with more than 40 in development;</li>
<li>More than 30 million users currently access Facebook through their mobile devices; *</li>
</ul>

U.S. Paralympian April Holmes. Tune in to hear her live; <strong>7/31/09 9:00 am EST</strong> on our new<em> <a href="http://blogtalkradio.com/wecangrow">Grow Through It &amp; Lead</a></em><a href="http://blogtalkradio.com/wecangrow"> </a>inspirational/motivational radio show.</p>
<p>Since her career in Paralympic track &amp; field began in 2002, Holmes has continued to succeed, improving each and every step of the way. Her latest feats include breaking her own world records in the 100m and 200m dashes at the 2006 U.S. Paralympics Track &amp; Field National Championships in Atlanta, GA. She then led a strong US delegation to the IPC World Championships in Assen, Netherlands where she excited the crowd with commanding gold winning performances in the 100 and 200 meter races.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 2001 when Holmes was involved in a train accident that resulted in the loss of her left leg below the knee. While she lay in her hospital bed, a doctor told her about the Paralympic Games and a new goal was firmly implanted in her mind.</p>
<p>Off the track, Holmes runs the April Holmes Foundation, a non-profit organization tasked with assisting people with physical and developmental disabilities in every day life. Having recently completed her MBA in Marketing, Holmes plans to use her education to improve the awareness of persons with disabilities while eventually testing her entrepreneurial skills in event planning.
