			<title>Episode #55: Lookout Records Tribute, Interview with Larry Livermore</title>
			<itunes:author></itunes:author>
			<itunes:subtitle></itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>&#13;
 &#13;
Last week, the  important and influential punk&#13;
label Lookout Records annoucement that it&#13;
will be no longer by the end of this year.&#13;
 &#13;
To pay tribute to this label that shaped not only&#13;
the genre but the thousands of lives that listened&#13;
to the tunes of bands they released records for&#13;
such as Green Day, Operation Ivy, Screeching&#13;
Weasel, The Queers and many more, I decided&#13;
to dedicated this entire episode to the great music&#13;
that it has released over the years.  You hear from&#13;
some of the well known bands like the some listed&#13;
above, but also some of the lesser known acts on&#13;
Lookout that released gems such as Monsula, The&#13;
Smugglers and The Hi-Fives.&#13;
 &#13;
What makes this tribute episode special is that&#13;
Lookout co-founder Larry Livermore was kind&#13;
enough to take some time out to be on the show.&#13;
He talks about such topics as the rise and fall of&#13;
Lookout, what his transition away from the label&#13;
was like, how Green Day didn't live up to his&#13;
expectations, what he thinks of the punk rock&#13;
of today and much, much more. &#13;
 &#13;
Check it out to hear this special interview and&#13;
the amazing tunes!&#13;
