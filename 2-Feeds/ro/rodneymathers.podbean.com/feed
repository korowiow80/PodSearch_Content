			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to this week&#8217;s show!</p>
<p>Sometimes it helps me to look at other people&#8217;s situations in order to keep my situation in perspective. Despite doing 7 years, 11 months in prison and another 25 months on S.I.P. parole, the resulting employment issues&#8230;..and all the issues and hurdles I face every day because of my stupid mistake, It sometimes helps me to realize that things could be worse.</p>
<p>My guest this week, Dave Custance, has written a book about his sister that certainly puts adversity in perspective. Listen to the interview and I think you will agree that life is what we make of it regardless of the obstacles we face. The book is called:<strong><em> <a href="http://www.sammyknowsitall.com/">Sammy Knows It All</a></em></strong></p>
<p>Remember, if God is for you, who can be against you?

<p>My guest this week, Trish Jenkins, has been where we have been. A successful business woman and mother of three little girls, Trish was living well in Australia. Unfortunately, Trish made some bad decisions and the resulting consequences landed her in prison.</p>
<p>What I like about Trish is that she has since pulled herself up and once again become successful by reinventing herself.</p>
<p>Her story just may have some ideas you or a loved one can use in the reintegration process.</p>
<p>Be sure and check out Trish&#8217;s web page.  She has several great books out and I encourage you to take a look at those as well.  I read her book, <strong><em>Treasures of Darkness</em></strong>, prior to our interview and I found it to be excellent for ex-offenders.  Just Click here: <a href="http://trishjenkins.com.au/">Trish Jenkins</a></p>

<p>Shanna has fantastic advice on things like goal setting and time management skills.  Although Shanna has directed her work toward helping women realize their dreams, I found much of her discussion useful for men as well!  I also found Shanna&#8217;s advice to be right on target for ex-offenders</p>

<p>Ted Adamson spent years addicted to heroin and suffered great consequences. He also tried to kick his addiction several times.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s interview, Ted describes what his life was like during his strung-out years. He includes all the dirty little details that those who have had similar addictions know all to well. He also gives frank opinions of the various treatment techniques he experienced and describes how he ultimately obtained a sobriety that has lasted over three decades.</p>

<p>Wow! We had some some major technical issues with the show this week but no way are we going to let that stop us! We kept trudging along because this week&#8217;s guest is must for the show.</p>
<p>Jan Coates stops by this week to deliver a powerful Christian based message concerning &#8220;attitude&#8221;. I think Jan is right on target as she addresses the issues relating to our attitudes, despite our situations. This is a great show and you don&#8217;t want to miss it!</p>

Wow! We had some some major technical issues with the show this week but no way are we going to let that stop us! We kept trudging along because this week's guest is must for the show.

Jan Coates stops by this week to deliver a powerful Christian based message concerning "attitude". I think Jan is right on target as she addresses the issues relating to our attitudes, despite our situations. This is a great show and you don't want to miss it!

<p>Have you ever stuck your foot in your mouth? We all have and my guest this week, Marie Dubuque, has some advice on how to smooth a situation like that over. That&#8217;s just the tip of the ice berg when it comes my discussion this week with Marie. Marie specializes in the navigation of the social interactions we all encounter.</p>
<p>As ex-offenders, we already have a strike against us as we start new relationships, date, and generally move through our social lives. Marie Dubuque has some great advice and we touch on a variety of subjects during this week&#8217;s interview.</p>
<p>After the show be sure and check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/mariedubuque">Marie&#8217;s videos on You Tube</a> along with the hundreds and hundreds of followers who have found her advice helpful.</p>

<p>Like a good book? How about a good book which not only has a riveting story line, but a good book that provides examples and advice for dealing with all sorts of problems that are of interest to ex-offenders.</p>
<p>My guest this week, Kenneth Weene, writes fiction but within the stories are examples of how people deal with life&#8217;s issues.</p>
<p>Before becoming an author, Kenneth Graduated from Princeton and and became a Psychologist. Along the way he became an Ordained Minister as well. He uses this platform of experience to write fiction and poetry in a skillful, sometimes humorous way, to both entertain and show how people exercise their demons.</p>
<p>His materials are great reading for the ex-offender and the families and friends of ex-offenders. Check <a href="http://www.authorkenweene.com/"> Kenneth Weene</a> out and take a look at his materials. You will be happy you did.</p>
<p>Remember: If God is for you, who can be against you?
