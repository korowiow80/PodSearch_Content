<p>Be sure to check out <span style="font-weight:bold;">&#8216;The People Who Touch Ryan Byrne&#8217;</span> at NextFest this weekend. It&#8217;s an entire hour of Ryan&#8217;s projects and such. I believe he&#8217;s doing a Question &#038; Answer period so, I encourage you to come and ask him deep personal questions. For example you could ask &#8220;Hey Ryan, who do you feel about living with a crippling alcohol addiction?&#8221;, &#8220;How drunk are you right now?&#8221; or &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just kill yourself?&#8221;. Well, think about it, it should be fun. <a style="font-weight:bold;" href="http://www.nextfest.org/index.php?page_id=691">The People Who Touch Ryan Byrne @ Nextfest </a> </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ryan, Trent Wilkie, Evan Isbister and myself (jesse) shot a few sketches to enter in Rapidfire&#8217;s 2012 Online Video Competition. The entry is at the bottom of this article, if you like it on youtube, comment, share it with your friends I will offer you the most non-sexual of hugs. </p>
<p>For those of you unfamiliar with Rapid Fire Theatre, I suggest you explore their <span style="font-size:16px;"><a href="http://www.rapidfiretheatre.com">website</a></span> and <span style="font-size:16px;"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/rapidfiretheatre">facebook page</a></span>. They&#8217;re known for churning out many talented improv actors and their crew has been producing some pretty solid web videos over the years. <span style="font-size:16px;"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/rapidfiretheatre">(Youtube)</a></span>.</p>
<p>
Anyhoo, Ryan and Trent whipped together some sketches for me to shoot, so I dusted off the cheapo led lights I bought a few months ago and grabbed Evan to record sound. It was only the second time I had ever shot comedy, first time using those cheapo lights and most importantly the first time we&#8217;ve ever had a real sound guy (Evan). Anyway, as usual, I&#8217;m beginning to ramble, I just wanted to say I&#8217;m super pleased with how it all worked out, I think everyone involved did a bang up job and the end product shows it. I hope it doesn&#8217;t sound too much as if I&#8217;m patting myself on the back, I did the very least to make this, Ryan and Trent wrote some good stuff and performed the crap out of it. That and also our sound was the most consistent and clean of all our shoots, Thanks Evan!</p>
<p>As of this second we look to be in the lead (by about 50) with 1,183 youtube views and a crapload of thumbs up. There are still two days left with some very stiff competition so, my guess is the scales will probably tip out of our favor anyway, but we&#8217;re still super pleased with the support. Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s given us views/likes, especially to those who&#8217;ve shared and retweeted about our video. I can say I&#8217;m blown away at how supportive and welcoming our indie film network is being here in Edmonton. THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!</p>
<p>If you still haven&#8217;t checked out our video<a style="font-size:14px; font-weight:bold;" href="http://youtu.be/d-d_KE3Iq9g">(Cliche TV)</a>, please do. Well, if you like it, post a comment on youtube, maybe a thumbs up&#8230; or thumbs down I suppose if you don&#8217;t. Also, our former co-host Chris Hill made a video for this competition he shot out in Toronto, which I&#8217;m going to say is my favorite of the competition so, I&#8217;ve posted it as well(the first link).</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey, Jesse here, don&#8217;t worry, I miss you too and I&#8217;m sorry about the break. Do you think we can try again? Start off fresh? It&#8217;ll be different this time, I promise&#8230;.. yadda yadda, I only hit you because I love you baby and so on.</p>
<p>So yeah, the hiatus will soon be concluded. The plan was to break for a while, as I&#8217;ve noticed how ulcer inducing the summer can be with addition of my seasonal weekend job, so I just decided. Turns out as soon as the season started calming down, I still had more than enough work to do with my other projects and day job. It really doesn&#8217;t matter, the show must go on, so like many of my failed relationships I&#8217;ll proceed even if it means I&#8217;ll be a shitty boyfriend&#8230; pardon, shitty host. </p>
<p>Ryan, Nathan and I have lined up some super neato guests and we&#8217;re always looking for more. So, if you want to be on the show, drop us a line.<br />

So, this time around we rambled a little loosely around UBB (Usage based billing), a CRTC ruling that was throw out earlier this year as it clearly kills the independent internet providers ability to compete with Rogers, Bell, Shaw and Telus.

This Episode is dedicated to the family of the late Ryan Byrne, shortly after the recording of the show he fell into a coughing fit, collapsed and was presumed dead at 9:18PM, June 30th&#8230;. the coroners report said the cause was consumption&#8230;. actually, I&#8217;m only assuming all of this, because you&#8217;ll notice upon listening he coughed heavily throughout the episode&#8230; and you&#8217;d be a huge jerk if you said something bad about the audio&#8230; someone died here you asshole. Anyway, before dying we interviewed Simon Glassman, the creator of the popular web series felt up, and as you can imagine it was awesome&#8230;.. enjoy.</p>
<p>Also, sorry again for any forced racism, nobody seems to react anymore&#8230; as if it&#8217;s ok&#8230; that&#8217;s terrible.<br />

Hey Gang, this episode Nathan Chris and Ryan talk getting locations, actors and extras&#8230;. meanwhile I spent a lot of my time doodling in my notes. I showed up about an hour and a half late which meant everyone was tanked by the time I showed up. Oh, weird note, hyperphontonic media was there when I arrived, according to facebook I believe that&#8217;s what Tito is calling himself these days. Anyway, he took off as soon as I started plugging in the headsets, I suppose he felt he would be intruding.  The four drunk&#8230; hardly even friends drinking and bitching about nothing does seem very formal I imagine. Anyway, enjoy.</p>
