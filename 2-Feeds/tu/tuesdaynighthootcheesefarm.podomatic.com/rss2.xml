      <title>Episode 30: Brandon Reilly</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1235133/600x600_6482928.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week our host have on Mr. Brandon Reilly. Brandon is the lead singer and guitarist of Nightmare Of You. http://nightmareofyou.com/ We had a chat about him being a new dad, his history, the bands history, being musically minimalist,  and how the band is releasing new songs. We play Out Of My Mind and we also play We Will Play The Victim. Go to their website and buy their music.
After the interview we discuss that Goin Places sent us a care package with t-shirts, buttons, stickers, and their first CD Girl Song Writing 101. http://goinplaces.bandcamp.com/ and finally in another plug the great people over at Merman Records http://mermanrecords.com/ sent us a copy of the Dan Vapid and the Cheats split with The Jetty Boys.
Once all the plugging was done we talked about Indiana Jones movies, Sam did a synopsis of The Social Network that was spot on even though he didn't see the movie. Jeromy visited his grandma for mothers day but not his mother. The  term &quot;poverty chips&quot; made an appearance and Jeromy and Sam share a wine glass of whiskey. Enjoy.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1235133/600x600_6053137.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week brings us some feedback. Thank you Allie and Megan. We played a song done by listener Allie when she was 15. There are some sound issues going on and I apologize for that. Donate on our podomatic site so we can get some new stuff. http://tuesdaynighthootcheesefarm.podomatic.com/

We had a new segment called Whiskey of the Week where we take a shot of whiskey we never had before. Nick saw Henry Rollins over the weekend, we discussed the Ben Weasel VS. Fat Mike feud. After the break Nick is lit and apparently is funny. Nick shares his embarrassing moment with a homeless man.

We want ideas for our next top 5 and you can be involved tuesdaynighthoot@gmail.com or Twitter: @TuesdayNightPod have the best idea and we will have you on the to discuss your 5. Sam and Jeromy share their late night stories. Finally Jeromy wants a tattoo you can vote where he should get it on our facebook page.  http://www.facebook.com/tuesdaynighthootenanny

Thanks and see you next week.</description>

Chatted about China&#8217;s new softer billboards about having children.  Jeromy tried to get us a plug on the show Pop Sickles http://popsickles.podbean.com/   We played the clip and they assume we might be racist and rapey and joked about it. Called out Patrick Stump from Fall Out Boy for being a P@$$y cause no one likes him anymore and is not fat. Laughed at a guy who was arrested and channeled Hulk Hogan as he was taken to jail.  Congrats to Jenn Duke for winning the poster.  See you for our big 20th episode.</description>
