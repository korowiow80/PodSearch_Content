I got into some ol vinyl as promised and am happy with what I pulled out of the box.  Maybe once a month I will do these vinyl sets.&lt;br/&gt;This Friday coming up we have a party worth coming out to in Toronto, we are pulling DR. Trance out of retirement, and bringing in the heavy artillery for our Reunion Rave that is being held at Nocturne @ 550 Queens Street West on Friday May 11, 2012.  We have alot of big names like Grimace, Dominik, Flex to name a few.... I would make it your business to be there for this chance of a life time party.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So as I mentioned this is a vinyl set, no laptops, no MP3’s, no if ands or butts, just good music via 2 1200’s and a mixer.  The way it used to be.  I was a little rusty... but got the job done.  Hope you enjoy and we’ll see you next week!!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Make sure you follow me @dj_redeyez&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Please visit me on Facebook and ‘Like’ my page to keep up to date with all the dates and locations of where I’ll be playing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/officialdjredeyezpage&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/officialdjredeyezpage&lt;/a&gt;</description>

I could not believe the turn out at this show... There were tons of people there.  I wanted to know where they all came from cause in the small town I live in, people just seem to love Top40.  Now that I’ve seen all these people, I want to start a proper House night up in Barrie... Who is in?</description>

I love my wife, I love my kids, I love my family, and I love House Music!  I got hooked on House Music when I was about 14.  I somehow ended up at an all ages night at a nightclub in Toronto called Club Focus located behind City Hall.  I remember the pounding bass lines rushing through my body, looking around and seeing people with their eyes closed and in a trance like state of mind, feeling every molecule in your body move in sync with the music.  I have listened to all different styles of music since and nothing can compare, well... let me rephrase that, nothing can make me feel like House Music does.  It is now part of my soul, it is infused in my blood, it is me, and I am House Music.&lt;br/&gt;I did this show yesterday on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.radio4by4.com/&quot;&gt;www.radio4by4.com&lt;/a&gt; and I wanted to post it as soon as I could.
