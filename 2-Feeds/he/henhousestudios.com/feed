<p>Peach has a grittiness, a raw energy and sheer lust for experience rarely seen in modern blues. Their sound reaches back to Big Mama Thornton and Janis with stunning vocals and rich brass, but with a 21st-century sensibility and velvety undertones that will blow you out of the water. Peach makes good use of the slide guitar, the B-3, the organ, and much more to give it’s audience a full dose of the blue experience.</p>
<p>Peach is lead by Peach, the band’s singer songwriter and plays guitar. She has tons of experience, playing and touring for years on end. Her right-hand man is Paulie Cerra, who is Peach’s music director and plays the sax as well. Peach and Paulie are accompanied by Maria Martinez on drums and percussion, Hardy Eason on B-3 and piano, Lynn Keller on bass, Joey Delgado on guitars, Lee Thornburg on trumpet and Gina Segall, Peach’s very young daughter, a musical prodigy who plays kickass blues percussion like she just returned from a midnight deal at the crossroads.</p>

<p>Excerpt from article:</p>
<p><strong>MJ: </strong>What about something totally outside your genre?</p>
<p><strong>GM: </strong>I like to think there&#8217;s no outside; that I can hear  whatever has a claim to make, but if you&#8217;d asked me if I were interested  in poetry set to music, I&#8217;d probably say no. When I heard Ellyn Maybe&#8217;s  &#8220;City Streets&#8221; on KALX in Berkeley I had no idea what it was, just that  I was transfixed. I called up the DJ, went to Amoeba Records, couldn&#8217;t  find it, wrote away—and after listening to Maybe&#8217;s album <em>Rodeo for the Sheepish</em> (Hen House) half a dozen times, I had no idea who the people behind it  were—a poet, and a musician/singer who sounds like many of himself, or  for that matter her-himself. But there&#8217;s a pathos cut with  self-lacerating humor that makes this the most surprising and painful  music I&#8217;ve come across.</p>

<p>I have started to write something about you for your site several  times,  and each time I am struck by my inability to describe what you  do in  terms beautiful enough, original enough to do you justice. But  it’s  always been this way. Who has ever been able to say in other words  what a  song says? Maybe it’s why I like your poems so much, they say  what can  only be said in exactly the way you say it. The best way of  turning  someone on to you is to play you for them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://henhousestudios.com/going-down-the-river-in-a-hayloft-coffin-the-evocative-years-of-robert-peters">A CAREER OF EVOCATIVE YEARS</a></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">by  Michael C Ford</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>My</strong> initial thought was to decline an invitation to comment on these 49 spoken word tracks. As an associate producer at <strong>Hen House Studios</strong>, during the gestation period of this recorded document, there might have been some danger that the subjective nature of my prose would take on the PR complexion of a pinch  of low grade salt. That being said, however, as someone who studied the important facets of the creative process with Kenneth Rexroth, Kenneth Patchen and, later, with the poet and translator Jack Hirschman at UCLA, I have better chance of identifying with what’s concerned the Robert Peters compendium of five decades of literary contributions than, perhaps, most anyone. And I/m really  talking about gifts which comprise his prolific catalogue, and how his many works have been assimilated into realms of the World Culture.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">One has only to listen to Peters, on tracks like <em><strong>Father, Son, Cousin, Country-Western Band or Home-Made Saw-Rig</strong></em>. With a combination of rhapsody and lament he invites us to experience the  rural landscapes, as well as the interior terrain of the years of his Wisconsin youth. Then, as with cuts like  <em><strong>Memory Loss In A Parkinglot</strong></em>, we’re  hearing him go onward,  into an undeniable poetic maturity. It should be noted that executive producer Harlan Steinberger is responsible for the competently composed, engaging and thoroughly complimentary musical backdrop.</p>
<p>As a hyphenated American poet-playwright- essayist-critical analyst, Peters has been continuously, acknowledged as an author of evocative, imperious perceptions, generally,  involved with the whole of international literature.<span id="more-3719"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Now, this 2009 set of aural genetic poetics, in their entirety, are every bit the perfect recorded companion to a Peters volume of print entitled <strong><em>Familial Love and other Misfortunes</em></strong>: certainly an indicative collection produced by <strong>Red Hen Press</strong>, in 1999, and still available via their website.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since, 1974, I/ve been aware that Robert Peters, as an artist who, through his differentiable talent, possessing both an illustrative image mind and the sense of dynamics to interpret character lives in one-man performances of his staged  monologues, has proven time and time again all deserved accolades for the wide and “evocative” nature, on so many levels, down the long years of his transcendent career.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The voice on this CD/MP3 reminds one of how grateful so many of us should be that Peters has never allowed his dark, poetic vision to lose sight of his writer/s integrity. The scalpel he’s used to probe into the, occasionally, vile body of University-sanctioned poetry never got dull, Nor did he ever drop the sutures covering the wounds of warrior poets he, more than once, went out of his way to encourage and defend.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">He accomplished his literary goals without chasing after tainted poetry prizes, so often achieved by too many of the mainstream clones beating drums for the Yuppie poets of distinction. It now, seems to be a perfect time, indeed, to put Robert Peters between your ears, harvesting your very own hay and evoking any necessary personal transportation container to oblivion.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>J. Glenn Evans of <a href="http://www.kser.org/content/poets-west"><em>Poets</em>West</a> writes:</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.kser.org/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3665" title="Picture 4" src="http://henhousestudios.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture-4.png" alt="Picture 4" width="237" height="156" /></a>&#8220;A new DVD released by Hen House Studios in Venice, California. Curated by Michael C Ford, the DVD is a feast of memories of poets, their friends and two members of the Rexroth family who also read from the works of Kenneth Rexroth. The passion and feelings of the poet are mirrored through the voices of the participants. Several of them gave credit to Kenneth as a personal mentor. His widow, Carol Tinker, and his daughter, Mariana Rexroth, a spark of fire off the old genius in her performance, was there. Michael C Ford did a marvelous job hosting this fast-moving, entertaining and engaging program. The program is a panorama of a passing scene of poets and memories that would have been lost had this wonderful high quality DVD not been produced. Our thanks to Hen House Studios and Michael C Ford for its production.</p>
<p>The DVD features Morgan Gibson, Kerry Tomlinson, Lewis MacAdams, Philomene Long, Eloise Klein Healy, Aram Saroyan, Bonnie Tamblyn, Sprague Grayden, Bob Brandts, James Cushing, Doren Robbins, Uri Hertz, Ruben Guevara, Carol Tinker, Brad Dourif, Mariana Rexroth and Michael C Ford.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: small;"><strong><span style="color: #000000; font-size: small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-weight: normal;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">For  Ellyn Maybe, a Los Angeles poet whose first full-length book was    published by Henry Rollins’ 2.13.61 Publishing, and who recently    released a poetry CD, “Rodeo for the Sheepish,” with musical    accompaniment, the addition of music to a reading is a serious artistic    choice.</span></span></span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>“I think performing with music can heighten  different  moods,” says  Maybe, “inspire new phrasing and bring out  different,  more outgoing  aspects of oneself. I reference music quite  often in my  work, so it&#8217;s  fun to actually work with music. For  audiences it can get  interactive as  sometimes people dance, sing along  and shake the fruit  shakers at the  shows!”</p>
<p>And it’s not just  the poets who see  artistic value in the collaboration  between art  forms. It also adds  dimensions for the musicians involved.</p>

<p>Raices, meaning roots in Spanish, was one of the largest groups that The Hen House has recorded to date. Consisting of 14 members, Raices is a full ensemble with a Latin flavor. This extensive cast of musicians was lead by Miles Perlich.</p>
<p>Miles not only produced and arranged the tracks, he played the congas, coro, percussion and a bit of spoken word as well. He was accompanied by Ravi Carman on flute, baritone and tenor saxophone, Merlo on bass, Adam Topol on drums, timbales and itotele, Dixi Ipina on quito, bongos, clave and percussion, Luke Alberti on keyboards, Mark Bagasao on tenor saxophone, Adam Rundquist on trombone, Allan Valladares on trumpet, and David Gaeta on cuica, agogo, chekere, bata drum, and percussion. Miles also featured special guests Bobby Matos on lead vocals, Trevy on coro, Juliete Flores on spoken word, and last but not least, Michael Sanchez with party noises. This is Latin music played with a respect and honor for tradition. As musicians and fans, this group understands and loves the music they play. This talented band was assembled for a one time only chance to record something truly special. Enjoy this unique opportunity.</p>

<p>Shotgun No Challenge is a young band with a lot of talent. Still in high school, these guys find time to practice and record their music even with homework and curfews. In fact, the drummer had to leave the Hen House early one night because his mother wanted him home. Shotgun No Challenge is lead by Andy Chen who sings and plays guitar. Ken Sugihara provides vocals and guitar. While Daniel Ogier plays bass and Joe Herrera is on the drums. They all rock hard. The drums kick, the bass bumps and the guitars slash. It’s plain to see that these young men love playing music. Westchester, LA based Shotgun No Challenge’s slogan is “westside softcore established 2001.” This band plans on taking their music to the top. Their next stop is the Sunset Strip.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://henhousestudios.com/the-mynzeer">The Mynzeer</a></strong><strong> </strong>is a very special group. It’s six members come from all over Los Angeles County. From Malibu to Redlands to Long Beach, this band travels many miles each week to play and rehearse. But these guys don’t mind because the music of The Mynzeer Ensemble is based on friendship, respect and expression. Self-described as “new-world music”, the group’s sound ranges from African to Indian to Jazz to Cuban and Western Classical.</p>
<p>The Mynzeer Ensemble is lead by Miles Shrewsbery on hand drums and percussion. J.P. Maramba accompanies him on acoustic bass, along with Brad Colton on hand drums and percussion, Patrick Richey on hand drums and percussion, Michael Birnbryer on tenor sax and flute and Matt Zebley on C horn and alto clarinet.</p>
<p>If you can imagine three guys jamming on hand drums, while two other guys blow melodic lines on horns and yet another guy playing thick bass notes, then you’ll have some idea of what The Mynzeer Ensemble sounds like. But to really understand, you’ll have to hear them play. So feed your curiosity and appetite for good music.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3409" title="Picture 1" src="http://henhousestudios.com/wp-content/uploads/Picture-13.png" alt="Picture 1" width="105" height="135" />Arguably one of the most talented and respected artists of his generation, Kenneth Rexroth was not only a venerated poet, but an essayist, literary critic, translator and painter. Perhaps most significantly, Rexroth was considered the instigator of The San Francisco Renaissance.</p>
<p>“The Signature of All Things” serves as a passionate ode to the artist, documenting a magical night of tribute to the genius of Kenneth Rexroth on the 100th anniversary of his birth.  Held at Beyond Baroque, the notoriously avant-garde Literary Arts Center in Venice Beach, this standing-room-only celebration attracted an eclectic and eccentric roster of participants extolling Rexroth’s impact on an art form.</p>
<p>By turns exuberant and bitter-sweet, this film memorializes Rexroth with wild recitations and wry reminiscences from the assorted friends, family members, former students, writers, music archivists, performers and poets who knew him best.  This documentary expresses, in its unassuming artistry, a lasting impression of an American original.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8966236"><strong>JOHN ROGERS</strong></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/8966236">LOS ANGELES (AP) </a>— Poetry readings have always been a blast for S.A. Griffin, but the tour that the venerable Los Angeles poet plans this spring may be his most explosive.</p>
<p>This time the author of such collections as &#8220;Unborn Again&#8221; and &#8220;One Long Naked Dance&#8221; will be packing his poems inside of a Cold War-era bomb and taking them on the road. The idea is to create the constructive from the destructive.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m taking one of the most iconic images of destruction of the 20th century and turning it into something positive,&#8221; says the strapping Griffin, who at 6-foot-3 is nonetheless dwarfed by the gun-metal gray performance-art companion that rises more than 7 feet tall when tilted on end. He found the dummy bomb, which contains no explosives, on the Internet and bought it for $100.</p>
<p>His plan: bring the bomb to a city near you, dropping rhymes and free verse by the hundreds on audiences everywhere from Atlanta to Montana, Oregon to North Carolina and points in between. His aim is to get people to wake up to poetry.</p>
<p><span id="more-3375"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;What I&#8217;m really doing here is like publishing poetry in a journal,&#8221; says Griffin, who is also coeditor of the 1999 journal &#8220;The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry,&#8221; a sprawling opus of 720 pages that contains the works of everyone from the beats&#8217; Allen Ginsberg and Gregory Corso to modern-day writers like Luis J. Rodriguez and Jimmy Santiago Baca.</p>
<p>&#8220;But when you publish poetry in a journal, usually the only people who pay any attention to it are other poets,&#8221; adds Griffin, 55, a member of the so-called outlaw generation of American poets that followed Ginsberg, Corso and the other beats of the 1950s.</p>
<p>Oregon-based poet Scott Wannberg, who has sent along a submission inspired by the bomb, agrees it&#8217;s likely to get more attention than any of the work he&#8217;s had published in nine volumes over the years.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s more devastating, a good poem or a good bomb?&#8221; Wannberg asks with a laugh.</p>
<p>Griffin has spent decades attempting to bring poetry to the masses, placing poems on the sides of buses, on billboards, in beer bottles. Several times he&#8217;s crisscrossed the country in a vintage Cadillac convertible with a loose-knit group of fellow poets called The Carma Bums, giving readings at coffee houses and small theaters around the country.</p>
<p>He plans to go on the road for five weeks beginning in April, making more than a dozen stops around the country, but with just the bomb in tow this time.</p>
<p>He has collected more than 100 poems so far, many penned especially for the tour. They range from Wannberg&#8217;s whimsical &#8220;Sorry About That Bomb Falling On Your Head&#8221; to Ellyn Maybe&#8217;s gentle anti-war lament, &#8220;Someday Our Peace Will Come&#8221; with these opening lines: &#8220;One day poetry dropped from the sky/and the animals grew iambic pentameter tails/and the people breathed in stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s inspired, a really beautiful idea to transform something like that into something poetic,&#8221; said Maybe, cited by Writers Digest as one of 10 poets of the millennium to watch.</p>
<p>Anyone, poet or otherwise, can send Griffin a poem and it will be included. He plans to take poems from the bomb and read them to people along the way.</p>
<p>All submissions must be delivered by snail mail, not computer — &#8220;I want to see that people made an effort&#8221; — and be no larger than 8½ by 11 inches.</p>
<p>Griffin isn&#8217;t sure what the Poetry Bomb Tour will cost him. He says he&#8217;s raised about $3,000 in contributions over the Internet so far, but spent $6,000 just for the 1995 Ford Econoline van he plans to travel with the bomb in. He may sell the van when he returns home.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I break even, I figure I&#8217;ll have come out ahead,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Over the years, Griffin has supplemented his poetic life with work as a character actor, appearing in scores of films and TV shows as everything from a cop to a drag queen. He was the hoodlum Arnold Schwarzenegger beat up in &#8220;Twins,&#8221; the Marine war hero whose wife Patrick Dempsey&#8217;s young Lothario romanced in &#8220;In the Mood&#8221; and one of the evil cowboys Clint Eastwood killed in &#8220;Pale Rider.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bomb&#8217;s previous owner, Robert Demott of Huntington Beach, acquired it nine years ago from a Hollywood movie prop house that was going out of business. For years he kept it in his front yard, in L.A.&#8217;s bohemian beach-front Venice neighborhood, just to shake up people.</p>
<p>Its provenance before the studio got hold of it isn&#8217;t known, but Demott likes to think it could have been stolen from a military base where dummy bombs are dropped for target practice. It appears to have been an old MK series &#8220;dumb bomb&#8221; that was popular with the U.S. military during the Korean and Vietnam wars.</p>
<p>By the time Griffin is done customizing it, the bomb won&#8217;t look all that deadly. He plans to paint it a flashy color (he hasn&#8217;t decided which one yet), pinstripe it like you would a classic car and install a portal with a window under its nose.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I get pulled over by the cops I want them to be able to stick their heads in there, look around and be able to see just what it is, an art object.&#8221;</p>
<p>Already, he has drawn some concerned reactions, particularly when people have ignored his instructions and mailed their poems to his post office box with the words &#8220;The Poetry Bomb&#8221; on the envelopes.</p>
<p>When he showed up to collect a stack of poems at the post office, an angry postal worker told him they &#8220;don&#8217;t like stuff with the word bomb on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After I told him what it was, he was cool with it,&#8221; Griffin said. &#8220;He laughed.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://www.thepedestalmagazine.com/gallery.php?item=10085">The Pedestal Magazine</a> Reviews Ellyn Maybe&#8217;s Rodeo for the Sheepish</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3335" title="ellyn_maybe_cover_small_hen_house_studios" src="http://henhousestudios.com/wp-content/uploads/ellyn_maybe_cover_small_hen_house_studios1-150x150.png" alt="ellyn_maybe_cover_small_hen_house_studios" width="150" height="150" />Reviewer: JoSelle Vanderhooft</p>
<p>Of all the things I review for Pedestal, spoken word CDs are my favorite, both because of their rarity (few poets, after all, have the resources to put one together) and the ingenuity with which they blend visual art, music, and, of course, poetry read aloud. The best of these CDs blend all of these disparate elements to make something that is neither music nor poetry but which uses the common roots of each to create something bold, new, and frequently difficult to categorize, save for the term “performance.” Indeed, the successful spoken word poet is one who does not just read his or her work, but performs it as if it were a stand-up routine, a monologue, part of a “Happening,” or simply as something meant to live beyond the confines of the page.</p>
<p>Ellyn Maybe is a poet who knows how to do just that. Not only a strong poet on paper, she is also a consummate performer with a warm, full voice that is as friendly and inviting as it is delightfully quirky. Few poets—indeed, few performers of any stripe—have the personality, honesty and, yes, unabashed geekiness which Maybe displays in her readings of the ten poems on Rodeo for the Sheepish. Her voice is not only entrancing but unforgettable; indeed, I would very much like to hear her perform live someday.<br />
<span id="more-3334"></span><br />
Happily, Maybe’s poems are not only uniformly strong, but also lend themselves to being spoken so readily that they appear to have been written with performance in mind. Maybe begins the CD strongly with “All My Life I’ve Wanted a Great Love,” in which she enumerates ideal qualities for a lover that are just as unusual as her voice: “Someone who cries at least once a year,” and “Someone whose eyes are not remembered by color, but by every film he’s ever loved.” Maybe then caps this inventive lift with a line that is every bit as wistful as it is funny and ultimately heartbreaking: &#8220;Ever since junior high, I thought this person existed. Now I believe more in cows jumping over the moon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe skillfully and wittily dissects the struggles and joys of her profession in “Being an Artist” and pays a touching, illuminating, and off-beat tribute to Sylvia Plath in a long poem named for her, and in which Maybe tackles not only the horror of Plath’s treatment at the hands of a sexist culture, but also the importance of her work to young artists, whom she still touches “through tin can lines we walk through.” But my favorite pieces on Rodeo for the Sheepish were the three in which Maybe speaks of women whom U.S. society frequently casts aside or overlooks because they are overweight (“Picasso”), quirky and intelligent (“There Were Two Girls Who Looked a Lot the Same”), or, as with the subject of “City Street,” just lonely, socially awkward, and perhaps depressive. While the poem is best read and listened to in its entirety, these stanzas are some good highlights (rendered in prose-poem format):</p>
<p>She dreams in psychedelic colors, fuschia and periwinkle. When she sleeps, the voices stop. Her voices are loud today. It’s the you’re not normal alto blended with the you’ll never find love baritone. This is her morning coffee. This is what wakes her up.</p>
<p>Today might be different. She whispers words of encouragement but because her ear is bruised from this lifetime, instead of hearing love she hears of and instead of hope it’s nope.</p>
<p>The girl looks at her finger. There was a diamond. She got it when she was 6. Her grandma said no matter what the world thought of her, she deserved beautiful things.</p>
<p>Someone shouted hey baby. It momentarily distracted her from the symphony of lonely conductors playing in her brain.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>When asked where she’s going she says the library. Her friend smirks and says you need to get out more…books can’t give you an orgasm.</p>
<p>She responds you aren’t pressing right then. Books have a double life. Just like readers.</p>
<p>While I don’t want to spoil the experience for listeners, the poem does end with a sort of transformation for the subject which is at once moving and exhilarating. Suffice it to say, then, that this poem spoke directly to me as someone who has often felt alone and several steps behind the pacing and concerns of the world around me. I dare say the poem will resonate with several women who have felt the same—whom I assume to be the silent majority of women.</p>
<p>Maybe’s choice of subject matter is not the only thing that makes her poetry sing. She is also profoundly skilled with language. Note above the succinctness and muscle of her lines and her tight control over them (“Her grandma said no matter what the world thought of her, she deserved beautiful things.”). Note also that the poetry in this excerpt uses such tools as metaphor and simile sparingly. Instead, Maybe gives her poetry force through pithy dialogue (“Books have a double life. Just like readers.”) and through powerful, unexpected imagery (“the symphony of lonely conductors playing in her brain.”) This succinct quality makes her poetry ideal for speaking aloud and also beautifully conversational and down-to-earth, two qualities which also make it enormously accessible and relatable—not in the sense that Maybe “dumbs down” any of her subjects, but that she manages to tap into such truly universal feelings as social awkwardness and isolation.</p>
<p>For the most part, a spoken word CD is made or broken by its musical accompaniment. Here, Maybe is extremely fortunate to have found ideal partners in Harlan Steinberger (who also produced Rodeo for the Sheepish) and Tommy Jordan (who doubled as art director for the CD booklet’s striking black and white photographs). Steinberger and Jordan’s instrumentals—of saxophone, drums, guitar and amplifier, to name but a few— complement Maybe’s voice, underscoring rather than overwhelming her words in such a way as to bolster the poems’ themes and ambiances. The trombone, drum licks, and harp of “City Streets,” for example, give the poem an even more awkward and unusual feel, which helps evoke its strange, sad protagonist. The steel guitars in “Sylvia Plath” likewise evoke the sorrow of the poem, just as the electric guitar wails and drum beats in “Picasso” evoke a mood of sexiness, appropriate for a poem about the beauty of large women’s bodies. Interestingly, sometimes Jordan (who provides the tracks’ vocals) will sing a line from the poem during intervals between words or a refrain that, while extraneous to the text, nevertheless complements it well, as the refrain “City streets criss-cross inside me” does in “City Streets.” Together, poetry and music create a unique experience that neither could achieve by itself. While the most obvious name for this experience would be theater, for some reason I find it much closer to visual art, if only because the mental images evoked for me by the words and music of Rodeo for the Sheepish were so bright and vibrant.</p>
<p>Fans of spoken word CDs and lovers of slam poetry with a nerd-girl edge should seek this CD out as soon as they finish reading this review, as should anyone curious to see the highs to which this blended art form can aspire. I cannot recommend Rodeo for the Sheepish enough.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-3315" src="http://henhousestudios.com/wp-content/uploads/webcp-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /> I&#8217;ve never been that big of an advocate of &#8220;oral&#8221; poetry (in fact it suggested sex to my dirty mind).  Nor did I care that much for &#8220;voice&#8221; or &#8220;performance&#8221; poetry, which always suggested to me a way to present otherwise dull poetry where everyone bows their head to the grave task of &#8220;understanding.&#8221; I thought of it as more arts org decoration because no one knew what real poetry was when funding it, so applause would thus take cues from Jerry Springer with all the slam and &#8220;stuff.&#8221; I am old fashioned enough to know that in black ink the love of poetry still shines bright. So what do I get in the mail but the new wave of the future of publishing: a cd of the recorded voice; a little booklet of poems; the photo of the poet&#8217;s life all in one neat little package! i revised my thinking on the topic. Maybe it WAS important to hear the old Celtic tremble of Yeats, or the dramatic sculpted prosody of Pound in recordings. So here is the gift of the voice of Robert Peters, Professor Emeritus who is probably the last academic scholar and real voice in American poetry to be heard.<br />
<span id="more-3316"></span>His accomplishment in critical analysis would awaken a Ford Maddox Ford. For decades he has made the academe tremble with his witty iconoclastic, intense and diverse critical work on American poetry, its poets, its pedagogy, its ultimate aesthetic. He has shown no mercy. I remember the subliminal courage he gave to my colleague, John Norton, a slight man tough as nails, on a cane since birth, who with me went to hear Robert Penn Warren read from his new volume imitating Native Americans to a packed hot house of academic elites. When Josh and I were classmates in Baltimore&#8230;I whispered to Josh that it was very stuffy breathing all that dead air and a window should be opened. After the esteemed poet finished one of his heady poems, Josh got up and banged his cane demanding fresh air in the room. Josh had read the Peters&#8217; essay on Penn Warren classifying his new volume as UGH poetry!<br />
Peters&#8217; many books of criticism such as Hunting the Snark, classification and commentary of American Poetry at the century&#8217;s end, or Where the Bee Sucks: Workers, Drones and Queens of Contemporary American Poetry were examples of his many books that have been methodically suppressed over the years out of fear of what he might have said about his contemporaries. Just before I picked up his cd book in the mail, I had been visiting college classes and had given a poetry reading. When I walked down the dead halls of the English Department, I saw again, the image I had known through the years when a poet visited and professors peeked from cubicles and offices through trolling doors with oblique glances at the alien among them. I had to laugh to myself thinking of the time Robert came to visit us in the D.C. area when I was teaching part time in the area&#8217;s colleges, that semester at the two Georges: Washington and Mason, where he was embarrassed by the pink round wintered co-ed bodies in the first spring sunlight practicing ballet. Instead of dining with the faculty he suggested we stop at an Asian vegetable stand and get some items, He proceeded to eat the raw head of cabbage like one eats an apple.<br />
Still amused at my thoughts of him I visualized his large daunting figure striding through the halls of the English Department in California on his way to class carrying his briefcase and an armload of books while timid professors poached and peeked with averted glance. I laugh and visualize him thusly as the Vikings in the ad on TV &#8220;What&#8217;s in Your Wallet!&#8221;<br />
Also in the mail was my alumni magazine and I thought again of Robert Peters when I read an article about Professor Gildersleeve, John Hopkins first teacher, who had heard in a hotel in Baltimore, Poe recite &#8220;The Raven.&#8221; He said his voice was pleasant, nothing dramatic about his recitation and was sensitive to the music of his own verses that he emphasized in his delivery. This made me think what a valuable thing to hear the old poets, the masters&#8217; voices in Peters, Yeats and Pound and others that would have been otherwise lost of not available as in Poe.  I was reminded of Peter&#8217;s scholarly essays examining his subjects prosody calling attention to half rhymes and devices of which I was unaware even in my own work. What a reward to hear the old poet&#8217;s voice.<br />
It is also rewarding to hear Peter&#8217;s selections from his immense repertoire. His many volumes that always take on something new. His &#8220;seance poetry&#8221; that Michael McClure calls his brilliant award-winning volumes of the voices of Ann Lee, the Shaker leader, King Ludwig, the Blood Countess of John Dillinger. For this new format he has selections too, from his many volumes. He&#8217;s the last scholar I know who is hip to every gimmick in modern poetry and has tried it all and in this set even digs into his biographical works, into the maw that makes the squeamish wring their hands. He knows the found poems, the ego poems, the catatonic Surrealist poems all the ones he has written about, labeled and many times practiced what he preached. He connects it all from the poem of antiquity to found poems of the scraps we pen today. I&#8217;m reminded of him again in the words of the first professor Gildersleeve who said: &#8220;Scrap knowledge is the band of many scholars. Not to see a thing in its connections is to not see it at all.&#8221; Peter&#8217;s greatness was not seen for the reasons I have suggested that shape contemporary poetry. In this new format, he throws a lifeline to those who are drowning in the scrap heap of today&#8217;s poetry. -Charles Plymell</p>

<p>(Hen House Studios, 2009) Ellyn Maybe got her moniker because she was too shy to commit when she signed up for the open mic list—“Ellyn,” she’d write, “maybe.” She’s an LA phenomenon, published by Henry Rollins, the lovechild of Gertrude Stein and Allen Ginsberg, a lyrical poet in hippie couture, a one-of-a-kind. Now, with <em>Rodeo for the Sheepish</em>, she shows she’s ready for Las Vegas. Brilliant settings by producer Harlan Steinberger, superlative vocal backtracks by Tommy Jordan—all of a sudden, she’s gone Motown and you can hear the sheer force of Poetry vs. Pop music in an arena the size of Radio City Poetry Hall. Humor, poignancy, universality, individuality—like all great artists, how she does it is a mystery, but Ellyn Maybe is for real.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><a href="http://planetgreen.discovery.com/feature/instrumental/ride-rodeo-sheepish-interview.html">Ellyn Maybe and Tommy C. Jordan Ride in a &#8216;Rodeo for the Sheepish&#8217; </a></h1>
<h2>Poet Ellyn Maybe talks about her new album of spoken word fused with music.</h2>
<p>I had never heard of Ellyn Maybe before a chance meeting in Los Angeles. Shame on me, considering her poetry pedigree is practically second to none. With her latest project, a spoken word/music album, Rodeo for the Sheepish, it is easy to see why she was named one of ten poets to watch in the new millennium by Writer’s Digest.</p>
<p>What’s particularly delightful about this album is that in addition to hearing her perform her poems, the album is also full of the vocal stylings of Tommy C. Jordan, of whose band Geggy Tah David Byrne once said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Geggy Tah are so post modern that they’ve come out the other side.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had a chat with both Ellyn and Tommy about making the album, inspiring social change through words, plus got a little insight into what both artists are working on next.</p>
<p>PG: What gave you the idea to do an album of spoken word set to music?</p>
<p>Ellyn Maybe: Since I reference music so often in my work it seems natural to do a spoken word/music album. This amazing opportunity came about when I reconnected with my cousin Harlan Steinberger who is wonderfully talented and he suggested we go in the studio and record a few poems with a click track and the album evolved very quickly.</p>
<p>We recorded everything at that first recording and then I went back after the music was finished and rerecorded some poems once I knew what the musical accompaniment was as that affected the reading.</p>
<p>We’re working on turning Rodeo for the Sheepish into a movie musical and hopefully a live stage show too. If anyone wants to create images for a track or a vignette for in between the songs they should please write me at ellynmaybe@aol.com.</p>
<p>We’re open to live action, animation, photography, painting, sketching, dance…</p>
<p><span id="more-3267"></span></p>
<p>PG: How did working with Tommy C Jordan come about?</p>
<p>EM: Tommy has known Harlan a very long time and I loved what he brought with his vocals, hooks and how that shaped things. Tommy did the art direction for the CD and that turned out fabulous!</p>
<p>PG: Is there an underlying theme behind the album?</p>
<p>EM: Interestingly 5 of the 10 tracks are poems written while I was in Prague studying film at FAMU for two school years. There are definite things that go through my body of work. Love of music and the other arts, feeling a bit different that sort of thing, what’s going on in the emotional landscape.</p>
<p>PG: I had heard some mention that you went to Prague to study…</p>
<p>EM: I’d been getting more and more interested in learning about film and also heard such amazing things about Prague. I ended up getting the Benjamin A. Gilman Scholarship from the U.S. Department of Education which made the experience possible. I only expected to be there one school year but ended up staying two!</p>
<p>PG: How do you see poetry as a force to help inspire people towards social or personal change?</p>
<p>I think because I reference different stuff in my work, as well as there being a social justice thread quite often in my poetry, people listening to it might get inspired to look into things. One can go to an open mic and hear very topical poems.</p>
<p>Consequently, the art that resonates most is timeless because though the names and faces change, unfortunately, the human condition is pretty consistent.</p>
<p>Since I began reading my work I’ve gotten a lot of wonderful feedback thanking me for my candor, people have resonated with the work big time. Art is a very natural part of my life, the fact that I was so shy and never expected to read in public but that I do has inspired others.</p>
<p>I have a poem called &#8220;A Day in the Life of a Working Poor Xylophone Maker,&#8221; which talks about a lot of stuff but like most of my poems that deal with social issues it is also surreal, imagistic, and has humor.</p>
<p>One thing I think that people enjoy is the mix of emotions and moods. I think the subtlety is appreciated and since my poetry is a natural gift, I just am very grateful.</p>
<p>PG: Picasso is one of my favorite pieces/poems in that it addresses a feeling that I think a lot of women probably struggle with. Basically the &#8220;standard of beauty&#8221; which stood for hundreds of years has basically eroded in one lifetime, making a lot of women uncomfortable in their own bodies. Can you talk a little about that?</p>
<p>EM: I think your intro to the question basically nailed it!</p>
<p>PG: Is there a favorite track on the album for you?</p>
<p>EM: Wow, tough question. There Were Two Girls Who Looked A Lot The Same is certainly one which I feel very strongly about but fortunately I feel the whole record came out really great. Deep gratitude to everyone who had a hand in making it. People were so incredibly dedicated at every level of the process. Now we’re beginning to rehearse for live concerts, very exciting!</p>
<p>PG: What drew you to this project?</p>
<p>Tommy C. Jordan: Harlan, the producer, is an old friend. He drew me into the picture.<br />
After meeting Ellyn i realized it is a moving picture.</p>
<p>PG: You’ve written some of my favorite songs over the years and I wonder, what’s it like coming into something where the words/music are already there, and injecting your own self into that?</p>
<p>TCJ: It felt fun. Sometimes strange. Strange fun. Fast.<br />
i love sopapillas.</p>
<p>PG: How did your own creative process work in this album?</p>
<p>TCJ: It was a Rorschach test to sound beds rather than inkblots.</p>
<p>What’s your favorite track on the album? Any of the poems really stand out and connect with you…affect you?</p>
<p>TCJ: Ellyn affects me in surprising ways. When words stop being words, its hard to say.<br />
My favorite songs are the songs that stop being songs, and become vehicles of transportation.<br />
City Streets makes me cry.</p>
<p>PG: What’s next for you? New Geggy Tah anytime soon?</p>
<p>TCJ: I am on a quest to ride in an actual &#8220;Poetry Rodeo.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Saturday I’m performing a wedding march I wrote for some friends. A good many friends have been sending Mendelhson’s &#8220;Here Comes the Bride..&#8221; to the showers; inviting fresh ceremonial tunes into play.</p>
<p>Geggy Tah?<br />
Luaka Bop (David Byrne’s label) now and again inquires about releasing a &#8220;Best Of &#8220;. Sometimes I find my finger wet and in the air glistening. – By <a href="http://planetgreen.discovery.com/accounts/persona.html?member=115262541">Alan Graham</a></p>

<p>Raised in New York City and Los Angeles, <a href="http://henhousestudios.com/metis-cole-with-bravo-and-second-son"><strong>Metis Cole</strong></a> brings a true bi-coastal flavor to his music. He started making beats and writing lyrics as a young teenager. In fact, Metis has been teaming up with Second Son and Bravo for over ten years.</p>
<p>A decade later, Metis Cole’s rhythm and poetry have evolved into one of the most complete hip-hop sounds around. Let his slamming beats move your body but don’t forget to follow the lyrics. Because Metis’s verses, like those of Second Son, are the crême de la crême of rap music. Look out for Bravo as well. This is a man possessed!</p>

<p>Why call this radio show “It Might Not Be Poetry”?</p>
<p>Because it suggest that what we will be doing here might just not be what we have learned to accept as the narrow standard the poetry establishment may have pre-defined for us. The program title is a fait d complie giving us a blank check to present elements of all current art forms.

The group was formed in 1992 by band members Mikey Gamboa and Edgar Gonzalez. Mikey is on lead vocals and rhythm guitar and Edgar plays the drums. Isouljahs also features Chris Bibler on bass and Chuy Gallegos on guitar. This band is true to the conscious roots Rasta reggae that they play and love.

<p>They are the best “homegrown” reggae band around. They have shared the stage with such reggae greats as Burning Spear, Culture and Bunny Wailer. Isouljahs is roots reggae music at its best. Their conscious lyrics and heavy rhythms are ancient vibrations coming from the past and headed for the future</p>

<p>Founded in 2001, <a href="http://henhousestudios.com/">Hen House Studios</a> is an independent record label, and documentary film/video production company located in Venice, California.<br />
During the first five years of the company’s existence, Hen House recorded bands for free in the exchange for the right to film them. (The Hen House Experience)<br />
Director Harlan Steinberger describes this time as extremely fruitful as there was no exchange of money between Hen House and the musicians who recorded there. “What we were left with was a pressure free, extremely creative environment that led to not only great performances but to one heck of a good time.”<br />
Today, Hen House Studios no longer records bands for free and but still concentrates on developing musicians, making music and videos and its ever-evolving music label.</p>

<p><a href="http://henhousestudios.com/fatal-charm">Fatal Charm</a> emerged from the echoing halls and banging locker doors of a Los Angeles high school in 1996. Orlando Ravelo and singer / guitarist George Nakhla joined with classmates Steven De Luna on bass and Michael La Penza on guitar to form a bulwark for the Zero Tolerance generation (and generally raise a little hell in the process). Influenced by bands such as Korn and the Deftones, they began creating emotionally-charged hard-core music drawing from both the commonality of their American experience and from their Mexican-Indian, Egyptian, Italian, and Cuban backgrounds. Four years of intensive practice and study later, Fatal Charm graduated from school and struck out for the Hen House with their new sounds.</p>

<p>Their sound is not  reminiscent of the traditional twangy guitar surf music of the 1960’s, but rather a reflection of the modern surf movement. The ideals of this new movement in their song “Kali4na” where Crash sings “I gotta worn ya, this is California”, a song that expresses surfers’ territorial rights to the best waves and at the same time their frustration with the increasing pollution of the ocean’s water.</p>
<p>The band got it’s name from the famous surfing scene from the movie “Apocalypse Now”. In the scene, Colonel Kilgore (Robert Duvall) commands a California surfing champion named Freelance Johnson into the waves even as the enemy continues to shell the beach. In one way, this band is a lot like Freelance Johnson from the movie, in that they will stop short of nothing in order to play their infectious music and ride the next big ocean swell.</p>

</a></p>
<p>-Based in Southern California, <a href="http://henhousestudios.com/boom-shaka"><strong>Boom Shaka</strong></a> is keeping roots reggae music alive and well. Founded just after the peak 80’s reggae Renaissance (lead by such notables as <em>Black Uhuru</em> and <em>UB40</em>, by singer/songwriter <a href="http://henhousestudios.com/trevy">Trevy Felix</a>, <strong>Boom Shaka</strong> has developed a serious following over the years with their brand of Peter Tosh-inspired sounds. Unlike some reggae, which leaps from genre to genre and primarily extols the virtues of a laid- back “party all the time” lifestyle, issues in <strong>Boom Shaka</strong>’s social and political landscape sculpt and shape their lyrics, giving them the raw intensity and emotion of a Dominican tenement.<strong> Boom Shaka</strong> has toured the world and have released a series of albums since their inception. Trevy Felix is the lead singer and plays guitar. He is accompanied by his brother Bass-I on bass, Lester Fari on lead guitar, Shaka Man on drums and Little George on keyboards. The result is a potent distillation of message and music, draped in harmonies and rhythm.</p>
