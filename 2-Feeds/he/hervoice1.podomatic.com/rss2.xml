      <title>Pimps? Eeeeewwwww</title>
      <description>&#8220;Cuz I&#8217;m a pimp&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Pimps up hoes down&#8230;&#8221; and all of those other things that praise this whole pimp thing that we at Her Voice struggle to understand. From the Playaz ball granting awards to pimp of the year to Bishop Don Juan, pimp turned preacher, we really can&#8217;t understand what mentality it takes to make a woman not only stand on the corner to sell her body but let a man reap the benefits of her blood sweat and tears. Tune in as Dee, Shanda, and Renee weigh in on two heavy topics: Pimpizm and Female Self esteem. </description>
