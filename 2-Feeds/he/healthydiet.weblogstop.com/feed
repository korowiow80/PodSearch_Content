			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/carrot-tops.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-342" style="margin: 6px;" title="Carrot Tops" src="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/carrot-tops.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="231" /></a>The carrots planted in our winter garden are still coming to fruition and the end of March has already passed. The carrot seeds, being so small, were sown directly into the prepared garden bed. We chose an heirloom mix with three different colored carrot roots: orange, purple and white. They have a mild and sweet flavor.</p>
<p>As beautiful as carrots are, it’s the carrot tops that really get your attention. The lush, green, parsley like foliage is so gorgeous, it’s a shame to just cast it into the compost pile like it doesn’t have anything of value to offer.  So before I decapitated those fluffy green tops from the long, stocky and stubby roots they were attached to I did a quick search on the internet to see whether they were edible. What was discovered is that indeed, carrot tops are quite edible and full of nutrition, especially vitamin K, but also minerals and proteins. Use caution however, especially if you have skin sensitivities, apparently there is some evidence that people can get a skin irritation from eating carrot tops called photo dermatitis.</p>
<p>The good news is you don’t have to discard your beautiful carrot tops anymore, instead use them like any other green. Therefore they can be used either raw or cooked; in soups, salads, juice and green smoothies. I decided to use mine in our salad tonight as well as in a new recipe called mean greens I came across from the Happy Healthy Human raw food restaurant in Indian Harbour Beach, Florida at 1869 South Patrick Drive.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday we looked at the new (it&#8217;s not really new for those Sardinians that are on it) <a title="Sardinian Diet" href="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/2009/10/21/sardinian-diet/">Sardinian Diet</a> and one of its main components, and extremely dark red wine full of anti-oxidants. Today we are going to look at another important component that allows dieters to get their protein. You are going to love this one.</p>
<p>It turns out that those partakers of the Sardinian Diet eat a lot of cheese, but it isn&#8217;t just your average cheese you buy in the dairy section of the local supermarket, it is a special cheese that is made by using milk from grass fed sheep. The cheese is called <strong>pecorino sardo</strong> and it is high in omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
<p>The Sardinians also eat another cheese that contains maggots (pretty disgusting) and I was a fan of the diet until I found this out. It turns out that Sardinian men eat this kind of cheese to prove they are tough and it may contain some kind of bacteria that aids in digestion and does its longevity magic. I don&#8217;t know how long I want to live if I have to eat maggot infested cheese.</p>
<p>In summary the Sardinian diet consists of very dark red wine, the cheese known as pecorino sardo, nuts, fruits, vegetables and very little meat including fish. Also the wine must be included while eating the meal to get the full benefits of this diet and hopefully help you live as long as possible.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been saying for a long time here at the Healthy Diet Podcast that meat, especially red meat, is associated with a whole host of diseases and the latest results of the Sardinian way of eating, while not scientific, certainly bear looking at. You can&#8217;t deny the hard results of living longer and living healthy while enjoying those extra years.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard of the recently discovered <a title="Sardinian Diet" href="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/2009/10/22/sardinian-diet-part-2/">Sardinian Diet</a> because ABC&#8217;s Good Morning America just did a segment on it this morning featuring the author of <em>The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who&#8217;ve Lived the Longest</em>, Dan Buettner. Dan has studied longevity across the globe and has come to some startling conclusions about those of us humans that live the longest.</p>
<p>Once again, as we have been saying all along on the healthy diet blog for years, it&#8217;s all about what you eat rather than how much you eat or how many pills your doctor may prescribe for you. As Dan found out, the secret of longevity is in the diet and one of the better ones he has found in the world is known as the Sardinian Diet. And you&#8217;ll be surprised at how simple this diet is. But remember, when we say diet, we aren&#8217;t talking about a fad-take-a-pill-and-lose-weight type deal that you do for 3 months, we&#8217;re talking about a complete lifestyle change.</p>
<p>One of the main components of the Sardinian Diet is that the people of Sardinia drink very dark red wine. It is so dark that they call it black wine and it is ultra high in anti-oxidants that supposedly scrub the arteries of cholesterol and other bad things. But you can&#8217;t just drink the <strong>Sardinian wine</strong> whenever you want, it must be consumed with the meals in the diet for its full benefit.</p>
<p>The diet also requires that you consume a lot of fruits, vegetables, nuts and not a lot of meat, not even a lot of fish. The Sardinians keep their meat consumption down to a treat like frequency of about once a week which is a whole lot less than what we are used to here in the United States.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also another component to the diet that helps individuals who subscribe to it get their protein. Believe it or not it&#8217;s in a special cheese that comes from goat milk, but you&#8217;ll have to come back tomorrow to learn more about that.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hammer has finally come down on <a title="Acai Berry Scams" href="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/2009/01/23/acai-berry-diet-scam-really-is-a-scam/">acai berry scam</a> and other health products using Dr Oz and Oprah Winfrey likenesses and supposed endorsements. The plain fact is that Oprah and Dr Oz have <strong>never endorsed these products </strong>even though Dr Oz has been on the Oprah Show several times and has talked about the benefits of acai berry. The pair is now suing some 50 companies for misrepresenting their images and businesses. The products include teeth whiteners, colon cleansers, resveratrol supplements, anti wrinkle creams and other dietary supplements.</p>
<p>Both Oprah and Dr Oz say their professional reputations have been injured by these scam products because the companies that put this stuff out use their voices, pictures and endorsements to sell their products, many of which are scams. Consumers are given a supposed free trial for around $4.95 for these products and then their credit cards are charged upwards of $80 a month without them being aware of it until the bills start showing up.</p>
<p>Many people have made a lot of money with these garbage healthy products from either the manufacturing side or the affiliate marketing side producing leads for these companies. The problem is that most of these products don&#8217;t even work and they are doing nothing for the consumer but ripping them off.</p>
<p>Harpo Inc, Zo Co., and OW Licensing Co. filed papers in New York Wednesday to stop what they say is &#8220;unauthorised and unlawful use&#8221; of Dr Oz&#8217;s and Oprah&#8217;s pictures, voices, and trademarks. Hopefully this action by Oprah will soon put an end to the acai berry scam products and other like it that are so prevelant across the internet. Several months ago the social network Facebook stopped all advertising of these products. It will be interesting to see if Google, MSN and Yahoo do as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All the rage right now is about the recent announcement of the <a title="Ruch Limbaugh Diet" href="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/2009/08/03/rush-limbaugh-diet-qwl-quick-weight-loss-centers">Rush Limbaugh Diet</a> as he modeled it from QWL or the Florida based Quick Weight Loss Centers. The diet supposedly uses supplements, an appetite suppressant, protein balancing and calorie counting and calorie restriction to help Rush lose weight.</p>
<p>While Rush has lost some 80 pounds in a couple of months according to him he claims to feel great and says he is the healthiest he has ever been. Several years ago Rush lost a bunch of weight and then gained it all back so he is now on the QWLC diet and is continuing to lose weight.</p>
<p>Do get me wrong , it&#8217;s great that Rush has gone on a weight loss program, but is what he is doing the best way to lose weight and be healthy? The problem with these kind of programs where you actually go on a diet is that at some point you have to go off the diet. Then what are you faced with? If you don&#8217;t change the way you eat on a permanent basis you will never be able to keep the weight off.</p>
<p>Weight loss and staying healthy is not about going on a diet, it is about eating a <a title="Healthy Diet" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/">healthy diet</a> every day, not just when you are overweight. If you want to stay healthy, you have to eat healthy all the time as a matter of lifestyle instead of dieting. It&#8217;s all about the mindset of how you treat your body instead of eating anything you want at any time and thinking that it&#8217;s okay because all you have to do is go on some calorie counting diet.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fool yourself, while the Rush Limbaugh diet at Quick Weight Loss Center may help you lose weight, it probably won&#8217;t help you keep it off. If you&#8217;d like to try some great tasting food full of nutrition that you can eat all the time, check out the <a title="Healthy Recipes" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/healthy-recipes.html"><strong>healthy recipes</strong></a> section of our website.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-319" title="Sprouted Rye Bread" src="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/sprouted-rye-bread.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="216" />Reminiscing the other day about one of my favorite treats as a child gave me the inspiration for this sprouted bread recipe.  Specifically, memories of my dad bringing home a freshly baked loaf of rye bread from Bangor Rye Bread Company still make my mouth water. Their rye bread was better than dessert. I especially liked the hard, chewy crust. And the caraway seeds were like icing on the cake.<br />
 <br />
To satisfy my desire for rye bread, I decided to experiment with the <a title="Sprouted Bread Recipe" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/sprouted-grain-bread.html" target="_blank">sprouted bread recipe</a>, which you can find on our website, by substituting  rye berries for the wheat berries. Otherwise the bread is made the same way :</p>
<p>First sprout  the grain for 18-24 hours, then process it in the food processor until it creates a ball, next shape the dough into a ball, placing it in a small Pyrex type bowl, place the bowl  in your crock pot, cover and cook on low for 6-9 hours depending on the size of the loaf and the consistency you like. And voila! You have a wonderful, dark, sweet sprouted rye bread that is packed full of nutrition.</p>
<p>The only thing the bread was missing was the caraway seeds….next time.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My wife Jean and I were watching Oprah last night (okay I admit it, I do watch O once in a while) and one of the stories she was featuring was about the world&#8217;s most extreme yo-yo dieter. The morbidly obese Michael Hebranko was a guest by Skype yesterday with Oprah and he has lost and gained more than 3,000 pounds in his lifetime. He once tipped the scales at 1,100 pounds, lost 902 pounds and then, amazingly, gained it all back.</p>
<p>Hebranko claims that at one sitting he ate 24 pork chops, 2 pounds of bacon and 3 dozen eggs and I assume that he has to eat somewhere near that amount on a regular basis to get to the kind of weight he was carrying and keep it on. That&#8217;s a huge amount of food and it also must have cost a good chunk of change to buy that amount of groceries. A quick calculation tells you that meal just for the food alone, not counting cooking an storage costs, would set you back somewhere between $45 and $50.</p>
<p>At one point in Hebranko&#8217;s life he was bed ridden for 3 years. Yes, that means he never got out of bed for a period of 3 entire years. Besides the obvious problems of cleaning and toileting himself there&#8217;s another problem no one ever seems to discuss in these cases. It&#8217;s incredibly obvious, but still, no one ever talks about it.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m referring to is how was Hebranko able to buy, prepare and eventually consume that much food without someone helping him? He had to have an enabler to allow him to get to the weight that he did. He was bedridden for 3 entire years. He had to have someone go to the grocery store for him and buy enormous amounts of food, more food than any large family would eat. Someone had to cook the food, bring it to him and then clean up after him. And that someone is equally responsible for his huge weight gain.</p>
<p>Hebranko&#8217;s enabler or enablers also had to make enough money to feed him as well. Even if you spent $50 a day to feed that kind of food addiction we&#8217;re talking about spending $350 a week or more than $18,000 a year for food for a single person. Those that weigh that much and are bedridden obviously can&#8217;t work so someone else has to foot the bill for food and everything else for them. Imagine taking $1,500 every month out of your paycheck to feed your overweight relative. Would you do that?</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the point of this whole post, who in their right mind would allow someone they love to eat that much food, especially when they are the one that has control over the situation because they are the one that has to prepare the food for them? We eat a mostly raw diet, but If I told my wife I wanted to eat a salad that took 3 heads of lettuce, a pound of tomatoes and a pound of carrots to prepare just for myself, she would think I was mad.</p>
<p>An enabler that allows their relative to gain that much weight is like the enabler who goes to the liquor store and buys a case of booze when their passed out husband, father, brother or mother can&#8217;t get to the car to drive themselves to get their own poison.</p>
<p>An enabler doesn&#8217;t have to necessarily be the one that goes to the store because their relative is to fat to go themselves. Maybe they&#8217;re the one that insists those at the table take another helping of mashed potatoes when someone says they are full, or insists someone eats a piece of grandma&#8217;s special apple pie when someone says no thanks, or makes 10 servings of spaghetti when their family only needs 5 helpings. Enablers are at every level of the overeating process, not just assisting those that are morbidly obese.</p>
<p>Please Oprah, let&#8217;s get to the heart of these matters and do a show that examines the issue about those that enable their relatives to almost kill themselves. Maybe we could save a few people from going down this path of morbid obesity.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-301" title="Vegan Burger recipe" src="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/vegan-burger-recipe.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="195" />Our latest menu in the LeStourgeon household will include a delicious vegan burger recipe also known as veggie burgers. This burger recipe is very simple and easy to make, but, as with most raw recipes it requires the family chef to plan ahead. To assemble on Sunday evening, so your family will have them available for eating throughout the week, start soaking the grain on Friday night. (for a sweeter flavor, try rye berries instead of wheat.)</p>
<p>In addition to soaking and sprouting the rye berries in an Easy Sprout (which takes 18-24 hours), begin soaking your walnuts and sunflower seeds at least 8 hours before you plan to use them. After the nuts and seeds have soaked for 8 hours, drain, rinse and cover with purified water and then place in refrigerator until ready for use. I soaked mine Saturday night since I wanted to be making vegan burgers Sunday evening.</p>
<p>As you can see from the picture, I used our 7 cup kitchen aid food processor to process all the ingredients together:</p>
<p>1.5 cups sprouted rye berries<br />
½ cup sunflower seeds<br />
2/3 cup walnuts<br />
½ sweet onion<br />
1 medium carrot<br />
1.5 stalks celery<br />
¼-1/2 tsp. herbamare<br />
1 tsp braggs aminos</p>
<p>When the ingredients have been processed to the consistency you like, spoon onto teflex sheets. To make a 3 inch  patty that is 3/8 inch thick (after dehydration) spoon mixture into 1/3 cup measuring cup and invert onto teflex sheet.  Next take the back side of a spatula and press down to form a patty that is about ½ inch thick. This vegan burger recipe makes 6-8 patties. Place in your Excalibur dehydrator on high for the first hour, then lower heat to medium low. Flip vegan burgers about half way through the dehydrating cycle. Total dehydration time is 4-6 hours depending on how you prefer them done.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Check out these healthy <a title="4th of July recipes" href="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/2009/07/01/4th-of-july-recipes4th-of-july-recipes/ ">4th Of July Recipes</a>. Traditionally burgers and hot dogs are the standard fare at most July 4th picnics with maybe a little coleslaw thrown in and of course potato chips and soft drinks such as Coke, Pepsi and the like. However, these recipes for the 4th are healthier and mostly raw, so you can have a great time celebrating our nation&#8217;s Independence and be healthy at the same time.</p>
<p><a title="Veggie Burger Recipe" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/veggie-burger-recipe.html" target="_blank"><strong>Veggie Burger Recipe</strong><br />
</a>What&#8217;s a 4th of July celebration without burgers? With these veggie burgers made from sprouted wheat berries and veggies, you can have burgers without all the harmful fat and cholesterol.</p>
<p><a title="Garlic Mashed Potatoes" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/garlic-mashed-potato-recipe.html" target="_self"><strong>Garlic Mashed Potato Recipe</strong></a><br />
Don&#8217;t worry, these potatoes aren&#8217;t raw, they&#8217;re fairly traditional garlic mashed, but without the added fat of sour cream and butter. We use safflower oil as a substitute for butter.</p>
<p><a title="Roasted Potato Recipe" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/roasted-potato-recipe.html" target="_blank"><strong>Roasted Potato Recipe</strong></a><br />
Here&#8217;s another potato recipe that&#8217;s delicious. This recipe is for creamer potatoes, but you can use different potatoes and cuts to make them more like french fries if you&#8217;d like.</p>
<p><a title="Cole Slaw Recipe" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/cole-slaw-recipe.html" target="_blank"><strong>Cole Slaw Recipe</strong></a><br />
You can&#8217;t have a 4th of July cookout or picnic without coleslaw. My wife Jean loves slaw and this recipe uses sesame oil and our famous <a title="Cole Slaw Dressing Recipe" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/cole-slaw-dressing-recipe.html" target="_blank">spicy oriental coleslaw dressing</a>. I&#8217;m sure you will love it.</p>
<p><a title="Red Cabbage Recipe" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/red-cabbage-recipe.html" target="_blank"><strong>Red Cabbage Recipe</strong></a><br />

<p><a title="Green Salads" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/green-salads.html" target="_blank"><strong>Green Salad Tips</strong></a><br />
This isn&#8217;t a recipe, but it&#8217;s just some good tips on how to make your green salads much more appealing. A lot of variety in your salads is the key to not letting them get boring.</p>
<p><a title="Homemade Ice Cream" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/homemade-ice-cream-recipe.html" target="_blank"><strong>Homemade Fruit Ice Cream</strong></a><br />
the 4th of July is a great time for ice cream and this ice cream recipe is made from nothing other than frozen fruit using a Champion Juicer. For a patriotic ice cream you can use bananas, strawberries and blueberries or blackberries for those traditional red, white and blue colors. This is a great treat and contains zero fat.</p>
<p>That about does it for our healthy 4th of July recipes. We hope you enjoy them and hope you have a safe and healthy 4th of July celebration.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-293" title="Beet Salad" src="http://healthydiet.weblogstop.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/beet-salad.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="188" />As lunch time rolled around today and I began to think about what to fill my hungry stomach with, I remembered the fresh beets I bought a few days ago at our local organic market. With Alan blogging out in the community today, leaving me home to enjoy the peace and quiet of our small suburban home, I realized this is the day to thoroughly enjoy my beets without offending my hubby.  Alan is pretty much disgusted with beets.  “They taste like dirt!” he says whenever they’re mentioned.  But to me, it’s the earthy flavor of fresh raw beets that is so truly palatable.  </p>
<p>This <a title="Recipe for beet salad" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/beet-recipe.html" target="_self">recipe for beet salad</a> is on our website and in our <a title="Vegan Meal Planner" href="http://www.ezhealthydiet.com/vegan-meal-plan.html" target="_self">vegan meal planner</a>, but it’s worth mentioning here because it is so quick and easy.  For a single serving, peel one fresh, small beet. Next, julienne with a sharp knife or mandolin. Then, toss in a small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, Bragg’s apple cider vinegar and honey. For extra flavor, sprinkle with sea salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Summer’s the season for beets. So if you’ve only ever eaten cooked or pickled beets, don’t miss the opportunity to enjoy fresh beets raw with this quick and easy beet salad recipe.</p>
<p>To your health!</p>
