			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="http://www.herbmentor.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/sean-donahue1-90x90.png" border="0" alt="" align="right" />Sean Donahue is a traditional herbalist and poet.  Sean’s primary teachers have been the wild and  feral plants growing in the forests, fields, and swamps around him. He  has trusted his own health completely to the plants since they first  began helping him begin to heal the asthma he struggled with since  childhood.  For Sean, magic, medicine, and poetry are all expressions of a deep  connection to the living Earth, and personal, cultural, and ecological  healing are inextricably linked. He is currently working on his first  book, a guide to plants for the underworld journey.  He identifies  deeply with the traditions of the edge dwellers – those who live in the  places where the human and wild meet, bridging the worlds.
