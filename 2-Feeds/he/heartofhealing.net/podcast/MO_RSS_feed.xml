<title>Music for Meditation and Relaxation</title>
<itunes:author>Mary and Richard Maddux</itunes:author>
<description><![CDATA[In response to requests, this episode is a track of music alone, without a guided meditation.  This is the last track on our Pure Relaxation CD. You can use this music while you do your own meditation or simply as a background as you work or relax. You can also use the music as a meditation by listening to it with your full attention.  Sit or lie down, close your eyes, and bring your attention to the music.  Whenever you find your attention has wandered, bring it easily back to the music.  As always, don't strain or try to force your mind to follow the music, just be easy about it and "take it as it comes".We love hearing from people listening to our podcasts -- visit www.meditationoasis.com and email us your questions and comments!]]></description>
