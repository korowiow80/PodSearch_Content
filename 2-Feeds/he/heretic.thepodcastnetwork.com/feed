			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The final countdown is here &#8211; there are only six episodes left of HERETIC, book one of the Templar Chronicles!</p>
<p>A heavy work load and some prior illness has kept me from keeping my originally hoped-for weekly schedule, but I&#8217;m determined to give all of you dedicated fans the last six episodes before the end of the year.  So this morning I&#8217;ll be posting three new episodes for you &#8211; Episodes 26, 27, 28 &#8211; and make the final three episodes available over the next two weeks.  During that time, I&#8217;ll also have some news as to what&#8217;s next for our podcast.</p>
<p>Thanks for staying with me and with the podcast.  I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the story as much as I have!</p>
<p>All the Best &#8211; Joe Nassise</p>

<p>In <strong>Episodes Seventeen through Nineteen</strong> Cade and his teammates journey to Otter Lake to meet with Knight Commander Stone, the leader of the Custodes Veritatis, a secret organization within the Order itself.</p>
<p>My thanks to all who waited patiently for the latest episodes. Renovations of my home (which took down my recording studio), writing deadlines, and a major illness in the family has held up production for a few weeks. Hopefully we&#8217;ll be back on track for the future.</p>

<p>In addition, several of you have written in with suggestions on how to even out the audio quality of the feed.Â  I really appreciate that and will put your suggestions to work while developing the episodes for next week.Â  Keep the suggestions and comments coming!</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be back next Wednesday (April 5th) with the latest two episodes of HERETIC: The Templar Chronicles!</p>

<p>In <strong>Episode Six</strong> we get our first look at the enemy in the character of Simon Logan, the Necromancer. In the midst of an attack on another commandery, Logan uses dark magick to try and resurrect a long-dead Templar, turning a once faithful spirit to his own nefarious purposes.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Horror Channel Teams with The Podcast Network for Episodic Release of Heretic</p>
<p>For the first time ever, a novel currently available on bookstore shelves, released by a major New York publisher, will be podcast in its entirety beginning January 31st. <a href="http://www.thetemplarchronicles.com/">HERETIC </a>(Pocket Books, Mass Market Original, October 2005) is the first volume in a new dark fantasy series known as The Templar Chronicles, written by International Horror Guild Award nominee, Joseph Nassise. The complete novel will be released in a free, thirty-episode, weekly podcast read by Nassise and sponsored by The Horror Channel and The Podcast Network.</p>
<p>In HERETIC, the Holy Order of the Knights Templar has been resurrected as a secret combat arm of the Vatican and is charged with defending mankind from the supernatural. Knight Commander Cade Williams is in control of the prestigious Echo Team, a special forces-type unit that is called in to investigate when an unknown enemy begins assaulting Templar strongholds.</p>
<p>Bestselling author Clive Barker called HERETIC &#8220;a first-rate, stylish work,&#8221; while the Trades Entertainment Magazine summed it up as &#8220;Hellraiser meets Delta Force by way of George Romero.&#8221; With the Templars back in the public view thanks to books like Dan Brown&#8217;s DA VINCI CODE and Hollywood films like NATIONAL TREASURE, readers are eager to experience more from this historical sect that is rooted in secrecy and myth.</p>
<p>Podcasting, the ability to offer syndicated audio content direct to listeners for use on their iPods or other portable media device, has grown exponentially in the last year. For Pocket Books, podcasting seemed the perfect way to introduce a wider audience to this exciting new series. &#8220;As a cross-genre thriller, HERETIC will appeal to a wide variety of readers,&#8221; says Amy Pierpont, Senior Editor at Pocket Books. &#8220;Podcasting will allow us to break down genre barriers and introduce Joe&#8217;s work to a broader audience than just the typical horror fan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cameron Reilly, co-founder of The Podcast Network and a co-sponsor of the event, is also enthusiastic about such marriages between podcasting and publishing. &#8220;While providing books in an audio format is not a new idea, podcasting provides readers with a new avenue to discover quality books to read,&#8221; says Cameron. &#8220;By making chapters of their books available in an audio version for free downloading, authors and publishers now have an opportunity to introduce their works to a global audience. In the future, The Podcast Network will be working with authors to find suitable sponsors for the podcast versions of their work, so they still realize a commercial return on their efforts even if listeners don&#8217;t eventually purchase the book.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Podcasting of audio books is a natural next step for the publishing world,&#8221; said Nick Psaltos, President, General Manager, and Founder of The Horror Channel. &#8220;Joe and Pocket Books are doing a tremendous thing, not only for fellow horror writers, but for authors everywhere. The Horror Channel&#8217;s website will be updated with behind-the-scenes writing information and information about the characters as new chapters are podcast. It will also offer a venue for fan feedback and webchat with the author.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Horror Channel has come to be synonymous with all things horror for me,&#8221; said Nassise, former President of the Horror Writers Association. &#8220;Their goal of putting a diverse range of horror products into the hands of horror fans everywhere made them the perfect partner for this project and I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased to be working with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Interested listeners can sign up for The Templar Chronicles podcast and can learn more about the series itself by visiting the official website, www.thetemplarchronicles.com. Listeners can also visit The Horror Channel website, www.horrorchannel.com, for additional information about the podcast, for updates, and for feedback and webchat with the author.</p>
