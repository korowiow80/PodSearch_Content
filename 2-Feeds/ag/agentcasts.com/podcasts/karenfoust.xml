Property Description: Karen Foust of Goedert Real Estate presents 2513 Lilac Road Reading, Michigan 49274.

The Rose Cottage was originally built circa 1870 in Cambria, Michigan, a once bustling little town at the close of the nineteenth century near Hillsdale. Over the years, this property was used as a Grange Hall a General or Hardware Store, a Local grocery, and prior to renovation, a single family residence. In 1997, the property was purchased by a retired building contractor and his talented decorator wife. The extensive makeover began in the Spring of 1999 turning what was once a deteriorated structure into its present day beauty. The entire building was stripped of the old building materials, however, an effort was made to salvage the basic structure.

This transformed structure is now three separate apartments. A lower one bedroom one bathroom apartment, a lower two bedroom two full bathroom apartment and an upper studio apartment with two full bathrooms. All units have fully equipped kitchens, separate heating systems and washer and dryer hook-ups. Although the current owners operate this property as a Bed &amp; Breakfast, this property would also be well suited as an investment property. The owners are including all furnishings in the sale. There is plenty of covered parking available for guests or tenants.

The property is within steps of the Cambria park, located on the shores of the Cambria Mill Pond - a favorite fishing spot by many locals. Although this property is situated in a country setting, itâ€™s just a drive to many area lakes, golf courses, antique shops and local theaters.
