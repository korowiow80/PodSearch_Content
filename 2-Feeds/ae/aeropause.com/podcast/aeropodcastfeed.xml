<title>Aeropodcast #195: The End of an Era</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2011/09/aeropodcast-195-the-end-of-an-era/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast195_20110826.mp3</guid>
<description>If there is an Aeropodcast that you need to listen to this is the one.  It will reshape your existence, solve world peace and so much more.  Actually, if you listen on a regular basis, you know there is no way that we could even fix any of that, as we are lucky enough to keeping the lights on from a day to day basis.

But in all seriousness, we did look at the whole OnLive vs. GameStop debacle, and how a company could get away with taking something from the customer.  Yes, GameStop is going to have a Cloud Gaming service, but right now, it is barely into Alpha testing, so why hit OnLive in the mouth with this dick move.  We also look at the XBLA policy of if a game is exclusive somewhere else, it will never be available on XBLA, showing off another dick move.

Keeping up the theme, our own Joe Haygood pulled a dick move as well, as he has hung up his podcasting hat with this podcast.  For those that may not be aware, he has been presented with a new opportunity that he felt he had to take.  The nerve of that jerk feeling that he is bigger than this whole Aeropause thing.  In all seriousness, he will be missed, and his contributions have been huge over the last four years.  Hit him up on Steam, Xbox Live, PSN, etc to get the 411 on what he is doing in the future.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Please Don't Go” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>It is hard when you get a bit older in life, as you totally forget things.  You know, whether you forgot to lock the door when you left the house, where you put your keys down the night before, or in this case, when you completely forget to post a podcast.

Yes, this podcast is a week and a half old, and I apologize for putting it up so late.  However, it is rather entertaining, and you should want to listen to it.

Also, as a note, we did not record a podcast last week, as things have been in transition, but we should be recording one this Friday, and it will be a hell of a show that you do not want to miss.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “I sent it to Haygood on time dammit!” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>Sorry for the delay in this week’s podcast, but as you have probably been aware of at this point in time, we have been performing some behind the scenes secret maintenance for the site that will hopefully make things a little better when you come to visit Aeropause Games.

As for the actual content for this week’s podcast, we cover all sorts of crazy stuff including the idea of whether pricing for downloadable games should drive the price of games downwards, the new Sony Play event and yes, how Fourhman wishes to be swaddled in a comfortable baby bjorn nested on Haygood’s chest.

Wait, that may not have come out as well as it could have, but that is the Aeropause crew for you.  Always making your day more uncomfortable for an hour at a time.

<title>Aeropodcast #192: Nintendo Blinks</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2011/08/aeropodcast-192-nintendo-blinks/</link>

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, Fourhman, Haygood and Stephen discuss what might have been behind the recent decision from Nintendo to cut the price of the 3DS by $80.  Did they feel the pressure of the Vita shipping at the end of the year at the same price, or could it have been due to slow sales for the device after four months.  Or is it the pains of having to compete against the likes of the Android and iPhone devices that are selling us games for a $1.00 a pop.  We look at all of those avenues, as well as answering a question from Harshy about whether it is wiser to buy a 3DS now and get all the free games Nintendo is offering, or just wait for the price cut to get it.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Guaranteed Low Prices” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #191: Uncanny Podcast Host Impression</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast191_20110722.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we celebrate the San Diego Comic Con by talking about some of the best, and worst that have come to gamers with superhero adaptations.  Of course, the game above is mentioned, but we look at some classic titles and more when it comes to superhero games.

Also, we talk up the recent clearance bonanza for those that visited CheapAssGamer.com and got in on the $15 Guitar Hero/DJ Hero bundles.  Who went in, and who skipped out on this deal.  We were also joined by S-Tip in the episode who, as most cool kids do, talks about himself in the third person and talks about the trials and tribulations of being in a multi-million dollar selling band.

<title>Aeropodcast #190: Serving Up Netflix Flambe</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2011/07/aeropodcast-190-serving-up-netflix-flambe/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast190_20110715.mp3</guid>
<description>On this edition of the Aeropodcast, we discuss the recent kerfuffle with Netflix separating their streaming and disc rentals into two distinct plans, and raising the price up for some from 30-60% a month.  It is a quality discussion that looks at both sides of the argument, as all of us have differing points on where we stand with the rate hike.

But the bigger news is that Stephen Munn has returned for a week after a long summer tour with his boy band, Brothers In Munn, featuring himself, James and Paul, crooning out to the ladies around the world.  Make sure to search eBay for those hard to find t-shirts, as they are sure to be collectibles when the eventually break up due to creative differences.

<description>So this week on the Aeropodcast, besides being on time for a change, we have a decent discussion about the recent spat between Origin and Steam and what it means to gamers in the long run.  But before we even got to that point, Fourhman and Haygood also dropped into the hatred surrounding the announcement of the newest entry into the Burnout franchise, Burnout CRASH.  Yeah, it does not end well for Criterion on that one.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast188_20110701.mp3</guid>
<description>Okay fans, we have some good and bad news with this podcast.  First off, the good - it is the only time you will probably get to hear Fourhman try to talk gangster in response to my comments about the meaning of the number 187 (the penal code for murder in California).  The bad - there were some issues with the recording tracks with bleedthrough on one of the audio tracks.  Sorry about that.

We do wrap up E3, including the rest of Haygood's Thursday at E3 as well as Roberto's E3 experience.  We also talk about a special E3 bounce house and our ups and downs for the show.

<title>Aeropodcast #186: E3 2011 Blowout Part One</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2011/06/aeropodcast-186-e3-blowout-part-one/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast186_20110617.mp3</guid>
<description>Hello Aeropausians, we are back with a podcast after going dark for a few weeks.  No, we have not gone away, and no, the podcast is not gone.  It was more about this little event that happened called E3 Expo 2011.  It took up a lot of time over the last few weeks, and while we thought about doing some podcasts on the go, it became obvious that we had way too much to write about to get the podcast up for the last few weeks.

That said, we cover a ton of ground in this podcast, with Haygood and Fourhman going over the things that they saw during E3 this year.  We had looks at the three press conferences, as well as some of the company specific conferences for EA and Ubisoft.  We also talk about a ton of games.  So many in fact that we ran short on time to get it all in.  Yes, even at almost two hours, we still have more to talk about so we will have a second wrap up show this week to cover the rest as well as put in some opinions on everything, including some best and worst items.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “I Returned for This?” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<itunes:subtitle>Aeropodcast #186: E3 2011 Blowout Part One</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>Hello Aeropausians, we are back with a podcast after going dark for a few weeks.  No, we have not gone away, and no, the podcast is not gone.  It was more about this little event that happened called E3 Expo 2011.  It took up a lot of time over the last few weeks, and while we thought about doing some podcasts on the go, it became obvious that we had way too much to write about to get the podcast up for the last few weeks.

That said, we cover a ton of ground in this podcast, with Haygood and Fourhman going over the things that they saw during E3 this year.  We had looks at the three press conferences, as well as some of the company specific conferences for EA and Ubisoft.  We also talk about a ton of games.  So many in fact that we ran short on time to get it all in.  Yes, even at almost two hours, we still have more to talk about so we will have a second wrap up show this week to cover the rest as well as put in some opinions on everything, including some best and worst items.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “What's E3” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we had big news – Stephen has returned for an episode.  The bad news, is that Haygood was inexplicably unprepared for the greatness that is Stephen Munn, and botched up the outline by forgetting that a topic was needed.  So we winged it and chatted about the events surrounding the replacement of Haygood’s card by Chase due to suspicious activity in a foreign land.

We also chatted about what we were playing, L.A. Noire some more, what Stephen has been up to and cats peeing on walls in anticipation of Fourhman visiting the Haygood Estate.  Informational it may not be, but it is chock full of laughs.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “I Returned for This?” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #184: Macho Man Diffuses the Rapture</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast184_20110520.mp3</guid>
<description>The Aeropodcast is a bit late this week, but we were still recovering from Rapture burnout.  As you can see, we have pictures of the real reason the Rapture was denied, and we can chalk it up to a great American icon that was lost to us.  He apparently gave his own life ot save the rest of us.

In all seriousness, we had a random sort of week, as news is sporatic at best with the lead up to E3, but Haygood did get to see the new Sonic Generations and Mario vs. Sonic London Olympics 2012 at a Sega event, and we dive into the intricacies of L.A. Noire, and why reading people can be a pain in the ass.  No spoiler talk however.  Finally we talk about the PSN Welcome Back program and some of the items that you will be able to grab for free.  For those like Haygood that had multiple accounts, laugh at Fourhman as he will only be able to select two while the rest of us will get all through said accounts.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “No Rapture = More Singstar” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast183_20110513.mp3</guid>
<description>This week, Fourhman and Haygood decided that it was time to discuss the big release of April, by disecting the ins and outs of Portal 2.  We talk about plot points, what we thought of the puzzles, the voice acting and the weird stuff that started to come about midway through the game.  Also, find out if we towed the line that most reviewers have taken with the game, or if we felt it was a bit overrated.

We also had our weekly, "What the Hell's Up with PSN?" segment, with the missed deadline as of Tuesday and if it is affecting the userbase.  NOTE: PSN did come up over the weekend after this discussion.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “PSN IS BACK ON BITCHEZ” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, Fourhman and Haygood talk all about the recent buyout of UGO by IGN.  With the buyout, IGN snaps up UGO’s most prized possesion, 1up, and gains several other lifestyle websites that they probably don’t care much about.  Our discussion focuses on what we think will happen with the merger, how it affects the news industry, and whether 1up will actually survive the final merger down the road.

Also,we have a ton of Facebook answers to a multitude of questions that were posted over the week, so big ups to our fans over at Facebook for making this week’s community corner fantastic.  Also, Haygood talks about his latest lunch pasttime – reading account suspension posts at Xbox.com.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we peer into the mystery that is Portal 2 to discuss the new Portal 2 app that showed up on the iTunes App Store.  We discuss the idea of putting extended news coverage of a high profile story and compiling it into an app that is sold in a store.  Can something like this kill legitimate news as we know it or is it just a great companion piece to the news that is out and about on the web and on shelves in magazine.

We also continue with the PSN outage theme, talking about how much this outage could be costing Sony and the complete lack of information that is coming out of Sony corporate offices regarding the data theft and the stability of the network.  Note, we did record this podcast before we heard the Sony press conference regarding the outage and how it would respond to the fans lack of network connectivity during this outage.  Our Facebook Question fo the Week also looks at the discussion from our fans about this outage.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “At Least Hulu is on the Xbox 360 Now” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>As you can tell from this week’s picture header (thanks Penny-Arcade), we are talking about the PlayStation Network, or in this case, the inability for fans to access said network.  It all started with people losing access during the busiest time of the year for online games, with Portal 2, Mortal Kombat and more hitting, and no online service to use them with.  We look at the reasons behind the outage, the lack of communication from Sony regarding the outage, and the strange time frame that was used in regards to an ETA (a day or two).  Now over a week in to the outage, we are still looking to find out when we will be able to use the PSN, and what compensation will be had for PS+ members, DCUO Subscribers and Qrocity owners.

We also have our Facebook Question of the Week, more of what we have been playing, and the community corner.  Hope you enjoy the show!

<description>This week (okay, technically last week, but who’s counting at this point), on the Aeropodcast, Fourhman and Haygood talk about the flying rumors about the new console that Nintendo is suppose to be unveiling at E3 2011 this year.  We know about some details (more powerful than Xbox 360 and PS3, touchscreen controllers) but where does this put Nintendo in the thick of the console war.  Also, what does this prompt the competition to do with their consoles after releasing new motion control upgrades that they are pressing on their current console owners?  We look at all of these discussion points.

Also, we have our what are we playing, facebook question of the week, community corner and so much more.  Also, make sure to appreciate what we are doing on the iTunes marketplace by reviewing us and of course, tell a friend to listen.  Oh, I almost forgot, we have another Haygood movie rant, probably the best since Transformers 2, so listen if only for that.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast (well last week exactly), Fourhman and Haygood talk about how marketing can play into the images that we recognize in regards to a game.  This topic came about with the latest issue of Game Informer, which prominently features a male Shepard from the Bioware space opus, Mass Effect 3.  Haygood was a bit upset that there was no alternate cover that featured a female Shepard available with the magazine, as it is a core feature of the game that you can play as a female or male character.  But Bioware has always focused all media for Mass Effect with a male Shepard model, which seems to alienate some of the audience.

We also have some great deviations in the discussion, as well as community corner and the Facebook question of the week.

<title>Aeropodcast #177: When Game Advertising Goes Off The Rails</title>

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, Fourhman and myself took on the difficult task of watching and talking about the unused TV commercial for Top Spin 4 to talk up advertising gone wrong in video games.  In the advertisement, we have Serena Williams and the “World’s Sexiest Gamer” advertising Top Spin 4 used with the PlayStation Move.  The trailer has both ladies dressed up in rather sexy outfits, while grunts and groans play in the background.  We both talk about how the ad may not have been used, but it got the game a hell of a lot of coverage, and maybe was a subtle attempt at deniable advertising for Top Spin 4.  We also talked about poor choices in advertising with the Dead Space 2 “Moms Will Hate It” campaign and how it takes gaming back a few steps.

The show also has feedback from our new Facebook Questions section, of course, our What We Are Playing and benign commentary that people have come to love, or hate depending on feedback.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Totally Dating Serena Williams” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2011/04/aeropodcast-176-stuffing-e3-in-a-4-foot-nexon-bag/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast176_20110325.mp3</guid>
<description>Okay, so I tried to find a picture from my travels at E3 last year of a Nexon bag, I was surprised that I could not find one.  So, I figured a sunbathing lady next to an expensive sports car would make up for it with fans of the podcast.  As mentioned, we are a bit behind on this one, but we talked about the issues that were surrounding admissions to E3 this year.  Friend of the show, Luis, aka SoldierX, was rejected from attending E3 this year, due to the numbers on his site not meeting a minimum requirement for E3 media.  I was surprised that his site, along with several other high profile podcasts that were shutout due to a lack of hits on their official pages.  So myself and Fourhman ponder over this new wrinkle for E3 attendence and whether it limits the news to a handful of larger sites that can control access to what we see from E3.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “I love Nexon Bags” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast175_20110318.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we have Fourhman and Haygood talking about how real world disasters can affect our beloved holiday.  As most are aware, a terrible disaster, and earthquake and a tsunami, have struck Japan, and with that, we have issues that have affected the real world.  We look at those items, including the cancellation and delay of games that are laced with disaster themes, as well as how Japanese gaming companies are having to make changes in their service for gamers.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Mixologist” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #174: No Dragon Age II for You Forum Abuser</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast174_20110311.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we have the triumphant return of Koss, and he brings a topic that is of interest of those that believe the own the games that they buy.  We take a look at a recent story of a person that had bought a copy of Dragon Age II and was not exactly enjoying the game, so he went to the Bioware forums to express his displeasure.  Apparently, one of his comments was not acceptable to the forum users and he was banned for 72 hours.  However, the ban locked him out of his game due to the forum membership being linked to his game login.

So the question came about to whether you own your games when you buy them and how much control the publishers have over the titles you buy, even when they are contained, single player experiences.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Screw You EA!” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>So yes, we are late again with the podcast, but unfortunately, our mixmaster lost all connections to the web, but valiantly struggled with Panera Bread Wi-Fi to get this and the next podcast transmitted to us so we could bring it to you.

As for the podcast, Fourhman and Haygood talk about the new site that has come out that will allow gamers to upload their Xbox 360 avatars and get real world merchandise based on them.  Right now it is limited to only a couple of items, but the Fathead Wall Sticker is easily the funniest item of the lot.  We talk about this and other ways that companies have tried to market avatar, or game items outside the game, and if either of us would ever opt in for something like this for ourselves.

<title>Aeropodcast #172: Turning Your Back On Gaming</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2011/03/aeropodcast-172-turning-your-back-on-gaming/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast172_20110225.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on a second edition of the Aeropodcast, Fourhman and Haygood have a short discussion about the times that they have walked away from gaming at one point or another in their life.  With Fourhman, it was awhile from his childhood days to his emergence back into gaming, while Haygood had real life issues, but was sucked back in by the quintessential open world game.

The two of them also spend a hell of a lot of time talking about what they have been playing, DC Universe Online and the idea of injecting characters into the back history of games, movies and comics.  Also, Haygood put himself through some abject torture that you will have to hear at the end of the podcast.  It is funny and sad all at the same time.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Humpty Dance” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>I would love to tell you what happened in this podcast, but I am going to be completely honest and tell you that it has been so long since we recorded the podcast, I cannot remember what happened.  I know there was some superhero talk, talk about the games we played and even a topic that came up for a period of time.  Basically, you should totally listen and let us know what we talked about.  It is like a meta-game.

<title>Aeropodcast #170: Featuring Joe "Gauging" Haggis</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast170_20110211.mp3</guid>
<description>Sorry for the delay on this current Aeropodcast, but believe me, it is worth it as the title alone is a story in and of itself, and yes, it is directly related to spellcheck and Haygood = Haggis.  For those that may not know, Haggis is a traditional Scottish dish that takes sheep’s stomach and then takes the rest of the organs from the sheep, minces them and then shoves them into the sheep’s stomach and then it is boiled to perfection.  Yeah, you probably just vomited in your mouth a bit.

We did actually get to a topic, where we talked about Steamworks and Valve’s plans for their system on the PS3 for Portal 2.  We talk about how Steamworks could gain a ton of new users with this implementation, and whether it could become the defacto online service for the PS3.  We also look at how this affects the Xbox 360 and their closed system in comparison to this marketing device.  There is also a community corner, but we could always use some emails and voicemails to spice it up a bit, so community, get in and do your part.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we go all over the place, starting with the denegration of my son via Eminem and Black Ops at a friends house.  From that point, we move into the main topic of discussion about the whole Dickwolves/Raping controversy with the folks over at Penny Arcade.  Stephen, Fourhman and Joe go through a very detailed timeline of events with the initial comic strip, the offended parties, and how the term rape has been desensitized in the gaming community.

We also talked about some of the hot content on the site, the fact that the forums are broken, but they will soon be fixed with a migration to PHPbb if everything works as planned in the next week.  Finally, we ended with one of the most awesome segments ever, talking up nostalgia about all things 80's in regards to movies, comics and cartoons.  We even had a reference to the TRON rap.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast168_20110130.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, Joe and Joe sit back and talk about all things related to the Sony NGP, or as most would call it, the PSP2.  Packing in features like a quad core processor, dedicated graphics chip and 3G capabilities, we break down everything from the big press briefing and Fourhman to buy a Sony mobile gaming platform.  We also compare and contrast between the NGP, 3DS and how they will face up to a new breed of competition with Smartphone devices like the iPhone and Droid based phones.

We also take a look at items on the site as well as talk about the in progress fiasco with the forums on the site right now.  We are working to fix it, and hope to have it nailed down shortly.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Who Needs PSP2, I have a Turbo Grafx 16 Express” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast167_20100121.mp3</guid>
<description>So for some reason on this week's Aeropodcast, we quickly got off the rails by discussing the Fanta girls and whether they might now be Brazillian prostitutes.  Who knows why, but it seems to be completely in step with where the podcast has gone as of late.

We also hit the Nintendo 3DS in depth, talking about the games, the price, and all other items associated with its release.  Our own Fourhman was invited to the big press event in New York held by Nintendo, so we have lots to discuss.

Finally, we closed with some items on the site, as well as the site health in general as of late.  Hope you all enjoy, and will make sure to tell two new friends, random Internet strangers, or the homeless guy selling you flowers on the side of the road to subscribe to the Aeropodcast.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Dating Grape Fanta-Girl” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we decided to break the hell out of the site…okay, so not really, but just talking about Haygood’s absolutely abysmal Netflix top 10 titles in his DVD queue was enough to make the site choke up a bit of vomit and die.  I mean, American Ninja 2 and 3?  What is that all about.  Thankfully, Stephen and Fourhman chime in with some far better choices to save the day.  Well, Stephen does seem to know quite a bit about Nathan Fillion, which was facinating and frightning all at the same time.

We do go into our what are we playing lists as well as answer a handful of questions posted by resident form member jrittmayer, as well as bashing on Little Big Planet 2 pack ins just a bit.  Hopefully, you get to enjoy this podcast quickly, just in case we decide to break the site again!

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Busy Editing Mother In Law phone calls out of podcasts” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #165: Looking Towards 2011 in Gaming</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2011/01/aeropodcast-165-looking-towards-2011-in-gaming/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast165_20110107.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, Fourhman and Joe got together to look at the releases that are coming to your gaming platforms in 2011.  Sure there were some obvious choices for us like Mass Effect 3, the Nintendo 3DS and more, but we also look at some of the more obscure titles that may not have a huge fanbase here like Yakuza 4.

Did we hit on your favorite, or did we miss something completely obvious.  Most likely we probably did, so chime in below and let us know where we took a misstep as we are always looking for some feedback.  Or send us an email with an MP3 attachment with your choices for 2011 and we will definitely get it in the next podcast.  Pinky swear on that.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Busy Playing Singstar” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, Vikki, Stephen and Fourhman talk up all things Resident Evil 5 (still RPG of the year according to Vikki), Babysitting Mama, Assassins Creed: Brotherhood, and ridiculously hard bosses in Vanquish.  And all of that happens before they even get out of the games played section of the podcast.

On top of all that info, the gang also talks about some of the big hits from 2010.  Some of the titles on tap included Vanquish, Mass Effect 2, Bayonetta, Heavy Rain, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Fallout: New Vegas, and so much more.  Will they pick up on the games that you thought were good, or do they pan the games that you love – tune in and find out.

<title>Aeropodcast #163: Epic Mickey Rourke</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast163_20101217.mp3</guid>
<description>Have you been sitting at home recently and started to think to yourself – “I wonder what would happen if you mash up Mickey Rourke and Mickey Mouse?”  Well, you are not the only one, as we got into a short little discussion about this exact topic.  Unfortunately, my busy schedule has prevented me from creating an Epic Mickey Rourke trailer, but fear not it will happen at some point.

Beyond that, we did discuss a lot about Sony and their rather disappointing performance during the November sales period.  We looked at why they performed so poorly as well as what they can do to save the holiday season with some dignity intact.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Mickey Rourke Fanboy” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #162: Joe's PS3 Comes Back Broken Yet Again</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2010/12/aeropodcast-162-joes-ps3-comes-back-broken-yet-again/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast162_20101213.mp3</guid>
<description>Here is another edition of the Aeropodcast, and this week, it is a Joe and Joe show where we talk about all things media rights related.  See, as Joe’s PS3 came back dead once again, he went out and bought a new PS3 to ease the pain.  However, that pain was not easily subsided as he had a lot of issues with media rights and Singstar.  So Fourhman and Haygood talked about media rights and this generation of consoles.

We also took a lot of time out of our podcast schedule to talk about Epic Mickey and how we were frustrated at how such a great concept went so far off the rails.  We each talk about our review time with the game and how it was rather upsetting to see this title have so many faults after all the discussion and hype for it from the fans and from Disney Interactive Studios.

Finally we have some forum stuff, some community corner discussion and of course, other inane banter along the way.  Hope you enjoy and if you do, make sure to tell two friends so we can create an Aeropodcast family of listeners.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast161_20101203.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, Fourhman and Mixmaster Stephen pick up the slack from Haygood and turn the show into the Happy Wii Hour.  I mean, if you guys love the Wii, you will literally geekgasm over this podcast.  We have the debate over the Epic Mickey Paintbrush-chuck and whether it is soft or not, Animal Crossing, more Epic Mickey, Flingsmash and so much more.  We even get a look at the huge year that Nintendo had in 2010.

Sure, there is other stuff in there, like the community corner, what they are playing and other stuff, but like we have alreadystated, this is jam packed full of Wii goodness.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Weed Pullin’” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #160: Tales from Black Friday</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast160_20101126.mp3</guid>
<description>It has been asked about in the forums and now it is finally here, and that would be….The Black Friday podcast.  Yes, Black Friday has come and gone, and as always, the podcasters are here to tell their stories of Black Friday.  Where did they go, what did they get and did anything crazy happen.

Fourhman will regale you with his tales of Toys R Us, while Mr. Haygood will talk about the frozen tundra and water machines for heat while sitting in line.  It is great stuff and it shows the length that people will go to when they want to get something for cheap, or free in some cases.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Wait in line? I shop at Amazon FOOL!” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #159: Papal Beatdown</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast159_20101119.mp3</guid>
<description>Okay, this podcast is a bit late, like a week late, but that is okay, because you will probably get two podcasts in one week to keep your ears busy.  In this podcast, we talked a bit about Epic Mickey and the developer call that we had with Warren Spector.  This is not a recording of the call, but some key points from the discussion.

Our discussions also talk about knuckle dusting the pope in Assassins Creed II, Jeff Gerstmann and his reading of the Nintendo WiiWare and DSiWare releases and some other site business.  All in all it is a great, blasphemous podcast for all of our listeners.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Offspring-Free” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #158: Kinect vs The Fight: Lights Out</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2010/11/aeropodcast-158-kinect-vs-the-fight-lights-out/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast158_20101112.mp3</guid>
<description>First off, yes, this is probably one of the worst Gimp Studio jobs that you will ever see on this website, at least until I try to do this again, but it fits what was discussed on the podcast, which was Kinect.  Yes, I, Joe Haygood actually dropped some coin on Kinect so we could discuss it on the podcast, and we were amused that Sony's best response to Kinect was The Fight: Lights Out.  Yes, The Fight: Lights Out.  Was this Sony just shoveling out a poorly received title against Microsoft's juggernaut of advertising, or did they feel that Kinect was going to bomb so badly that The Fight: Lights Out was all they needed to combat it.

Listen in as Mr. Haygood and company talk about Kinect Sports, Kinect Adventures and of course, the Kinect Joyride Demo.  What was good, what was bad, and how about that dashboard control that he was so hyped up about before the device hit retail.  The responses will leave you shocked and surprised.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we take things a little more raw then you might be used to, but it is all for a good reason.  I mean we were talking about Kinect and things tend to get a bit heated when discussing this topic.  It Kinect good?  Will it be fun?  Well, we don't answer much of that, but we do talk about some of the release titles and some of the potential that is waiting to be tapped by more hardcore game titles.

We also discuss quite a bit about Rock Band 3 and mine and Fourhman's impressions on the title.  Both of us enjoy it, but Fourhman was a bit underwhelmed by the idea of having a pro mode, while Joe was happy with the fact that everything you do works towards some goal in the game.

We also have our "What are We Playing Segment", we talk about the Splatterhouse contest and so much more.  Make sure to tell a friend about our great podcast as well, as we want to buff up those subscriber numbers.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Kinectamles” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>Sorry for the delay with this week's podcast, but it should be worth it as we had Vikki join Joe this week with two guests, Tommy Refenes and Edmund McMileen, the creative duo at Team Meat.  For those that might be unaware, Team Meat is the development house that created Super Meat Boy, the newest platformer that has hit Xbox Live.  We talk about the game, the perceived difficulty of the title, getting a game made with a smaller staff, Xbox Live certification and so much more.

Note: We recorded this with a different recording program, so apologies if the quality is not as good as normal.  I think it is still very enjoyable.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Mini Meat Boy” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #155: The Gandhi Scourge</title>

<description>Things are a-changin' here on the podcast, as we now have pre-recorded the normal intro items, so we can get to the meat of the actual podcast, which is topics, games and of course, weird tangents, which is where our podcast topic comes from.  Yes, Civ fans, you probably know where this is going, but the rest of you are in for a treat.  We also look at the recent announcement by the NPD to do away with release numbers and just give us some random lists.

Our community corner also features more codes for Enslaved: Odyssey to the West and highlights some other features on the site.  We did not get to the user posts on the NPD topic, but we will put them in the community corner for next week.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Gandhi-monger” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, the ever popular Fourhman and Mixmaster Munn get together to talk about the new Nintendo 3DS and the current translated price of $300.  It then begged the question of looking at previous handheld launches and pricing to see if Nintendo was in line or maybe just greed.  They also seem to have a great laugh over the currrent addition of the great Marvel villian, MODOK to Marvel vs. Capcom.  We also have a ton of Enslaved: Odyssey to the West costume codes for both PS3 and Xbox 360 so make sure to get in on those if you want some new costumes for your game characters.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “DJ MODOK".

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, the full crew is back and we are talking about remakes and how we feel about them.  A lot of this discussion came up due to the recent rash of old classics being remade for current generation consoles.  Some of the titles we discussed include Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, Beyond Good and Evil HD, Final Frame 2 and several others.  We also have some quick takes on the recent Good Old Games publicity stunt and of course look at popular stories on the site.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Pej” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>Today, Aeropause was invited along with several other sites to sit in on a developer round table for the upcoming 2K Sports basketball title, NBA 2K11.  On the call were two persons from the development team, Erick Boerish and Rob Jones, and they go through all different items, including the much hyped Jordan Challenge mode.  Sadly, my question about Space Jam bonus DLC content was left completely unanswered.  The call clocks in just under an hour so enjoy the bonus content on the Aeropodcast feed boys and girls.

<description>This week on the Haygood-less podcast, Mr. Fourhman, takes the reign of things with Mixmaster Munn to discuss reviewers and whether they need context of prior games in a series to review a title.  The discussion has come up from time to time based on things like the recently released Metroid: Other M, Metal Gear Solid and similar titles.  Can you respect the source of the review if they have not played a prior Kingdom Hearts title, or is there a new perspective that can be had from a fresh set of eyes on the series.  Also, listen to us discuss games that would be fun to send back to a 1980's gamer to blow their mind.

Also, there is a small monologue on Shenmue at the beginning of the podcast which mandated a picture of the infamous quote from the game.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Sailor-Man!” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>This week is a very special podcast, as we have put the band back together so to speak, with Koss, Stephen, Joe and Joe joining together for one big kumbaya fest.  Okay, maybe not that strange, but we did have a great podcast together after a rough start and a few interruptions.  This week we had a nice huge Metroid: Other M bitch fest with Stephen and Fourhman taking center stage for the discussion.  Also, we look at some of the problems showing up with co-op and Halo Reach on flash drive based 360 units, and a bit on a new patent that Sony has put in for attaching a PS2 emulation device to the PS3 via USB cable.  As for the Red Faction: Guerrilla picture.  Well, it comes up at one point, so why not.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we have another edition of the Joe and Joe show, and we talk about what is important to gamers - possibly getting the shaft from developers.  Well, not exactly, but we do talk a bit about the recent controversy surrounding the DLC that was shipped for Mafia II this week.  Is it content stripped from the game, or just some lazy coding to get some new content to market.  After that, we look at the NPD's for August and try to decipher whether there are troubles in Nintendotopia or if this is just a small speedbump going into the holiday season.  And where was Kane and Lynch 2 in the August sales run.  All this and more can be found with one click of the link, or even better, keep coming back every week with a subscription via your favorite mode of listening, be it iTunes, Zune or some other podcatcher.

<description>Here we are again on our own….goin’ down the only road we’ve ever known….like a drifter we were born to walk alo- Sorry about that, been playing far too much Lips this weekend.  Anyway, this week’s podcast was a damn fine show featuring the ever popular Joe and Joe Show in the Morning and Evening.  The Two Joes talk shop about the Duke Nukem Forever announcement, the increase in price for Xbox Live Gold Members starting in the fall, the strange meld of brands for Telltale’s new poker game and finally, rap music coming to Rock Band.

Also, listen to our DLC ideas for the Telltale poker title, including Matthew Broederick, Optimus Prime, the Ghetto bots, and the best possible choice ever, Roman Bellic.  If you are wondering how the picture for this post relates to the podcast, don’t bother.  I have to admit that I was lazy and Leeloo Dallas popped into my head.  Sometimes genius just works that way.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we again look at several relevant topics that have crept into gamer discussion around the web.    First we try to gauge Joe Fourhman as a PS3 owner, to find out where he stands on Mass Effect 2 and its arrival on the PS3.  Pay attention as his opinion counts for all PS3 owners in existence.  Also, we looked at the issue of PR firm Reverb settling charges of misleading reviews on iTunes and finally we discuss our views on Target, Best Buy and more getting into the used game business.  Will it help or hurt the industry and will the carniverous attitude towards these chains indirectly kill off the used game marketplace?  Tune in to find out!

<title>Aeropodcast #146: Flying Blind</title>

<description>In what may be either the biggest podcast debacle ever, or greatest podcast you have ever listened to, the Joe and Joe show flew completely blind this week.  There was no outline, no show notes, and no real direction for the podcast.  That said, I think we had one of our best shows in quite some time, as we jumped from Kinect to Move to Nintendo to blowjobs.  Yeah, it went down pretty much just like it reads.  Let us know what you think and if the reception is positive, maybe we will do more shows like this, where we just let the discussion handle the flow of the podcast.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Fila Fresh Crew” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropause Presents: Mafia II Developer Call</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2010/08/mafia-ii-developer-call/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/mafia2editconference.mp3</guid>
<description>Today, we have a nice little treat for our readers and listeners out there on the Internets.  Aeropause was invited to attend a developer call for the soon to be released 2K Games title, Mafia II.  The call features audio from our good friend at Access Communications, Chase as our moderator, and Jack Scalici, director of creative production on Mafia II.  The questions were submitted by all the journalists attending, and it was nice to get my multiplayer question answered.

I just want to point out that I took a shot at editing this audio, and while it is not perfect, and there are a few squeaks from my chair, overall, I felt pretty confident in posting this up.  The audio is Dean Martin's, "Kick in the Head", which is featured in the game, as well as the latest promo trailer.  Let us know if you prefer the audio from these calls, or if you want us to keep doing a standard article write up.

The audio can be downloaded directly from this location, or you can grab it through our standard podcast feed.  Thanks again to Chase, Jack and all the fine folks at 2K Games for including Aeropause and our readers/listeners in this Mafia II developer call.

<title>Aeropodcast #145: On Oral Defecation</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropocast145_20100807.mp3</guid>
<description>As most might realize, we strive for a high brow, quality gaming filled podcast.  And if you listen to this week’s podcast, you will probably get a lot of that as the Joe and Joe show cover all things relating to the soon to be tried Video Game lawsuit that will go in front of the Supreme Court this year.  We also cover some news, what we are playing and more.  But somehow, we managed to work in a story that will probably push the normal bounds of decency this week, and if you are a regular listener, you know that means that the line was stepped over by several feet.  But you know what?  At least it is a funny ass story.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Poop Chow” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #144: Your Morning Cup of Joe</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2010/08/aeropodcast-144-your-morning-cup-of-joe/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast144_20100730.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we have turned the show into a morning/evening radio show.  Well, not really, but we did start to go down that road, as it was Joe and Joe in the Evening!

Okay, once you get over the yelling, we actually did have a pretty good show, where the two Joe's talked up comedy in gaming.  We looked at why creating a true comedy game is rather difficult, using Deathspank, Brutal Legend and others as examples.

We also have some nerd rage as we talk up Fourhman's playlist, which included Brutal Legend.  The mere mention of this sets Haygood in a frothy rage, as he looks at, and quotes, some of the 9 out of 10 review for the title on IGN.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “DJ Qbert” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #143: Fanatic vs. Fan</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast143_20100725.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the fashionably late Aeropodcast, we talk about the fine line that exists between being a fan of a series and becoming a raging fanboy of a frachise.  We look at some of our own experiences with articles that have drawn rage from fanboys, as well as some of our own tirades that have come from being a little too close to a series or franchise.

We also cover our reader mail and again, mention our latest Zune review that we forget to read on the podcast.  Next week Snyder, I swear on it.  We also joke a bit more about our site issues, which seem to be fixed, so score one for Vikki on that front.

<title>Aeropodcast #142: Fourhman’s Open Invite to a Munn Family Thanksgiving</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast142_20100716.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, it was the Joe and Joe show again, as Koss was sitting in an airport doing his best Tom Hanks Tourist impersonation.  The show started off a bit slow, but worked its way through the games and into the meat of the evening, smaller game development teams and smaller titles coming from big time publishers.  Some of the examples used included Dark Void Zero, Battlefield 1943 and Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light.

Also, in community corner, we have a call to arms for all real men and their need to see The Expendables in August, and a great battle of Munn’s over the Transformers review that went live on the site last week.  It is a battle for the ages, so make sure to check that out.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Whoudini” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast141_20100709.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we heard the calls about E3 and skipped a second discussion on the podcast this week.  Instead, we talk about the insanity of the PS3 repair process, and the arbitrary rules that constitute getting a Slim over getting a repair and so much more. 

After that rant, we get on to the topic at hand, where Fourhman and Haygood talk about the big games that captured their fancy in the first half of 2010, and what has disappointed, along wtih a look at some of our choice picks for the rest of 2010.

<title>Aeropodcast Special Edition: Interview with Julian Castillo</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2010/07/luchador-mask-winner-and-bonus-lucha-libre-interview/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/LuchaLibreinterview.mp3</guid>
<description>We received a few entries for our contest, but none as inspired as Tony Sadowski and his Rock-like pose for the camera.  Also, Tony “The Federali Killer” Sadowski is a known fan of Lucha Libre, and enjoys the madness and insanity that happens in the six sided ring.  Tony, you will have your sweet Luchador mask sent out shortly from Slang Entertainment, and I cannot wait to see the Mask vs. Hair match that comes out of Fourhman vs. Sadowski.  Pictures when it happens folks!

But Aeropause is not just satisfied with giving you a winner to a contest.  Absolutely not!  So along with out contest, Julian Castillo, lead developer from Immersion Entertainment, talked to us for a bit last week about Lucha Libre: Heroes Del Ring, why the game will appeal to US audiences and more.  Pardon the quality as we were going through some strange routing channels to get together, but if you give it a shot, you will find a very entertaining interview, albeit, not as professional sounding as the Koss-Man.

This interview was mixed, by Stephen “The Facinator” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>This week, the Aeropodcast finally sees the triumphant return of Haygood and his faceplanting style of podcasting.  Joining him in his return are Koss and Fourhman, the best wingmen on the planet.  As for the podcast this week, we stumbled through the opening a bit, but things got lively for the topic as we talked about E3 and games, and left out the boring conference parts.  Some of the titles included the 3DS, Kinect, XCOM, Zelda, Epic Mickey and so many more titles.  As a matter of fact, we went on for over two hours and still had more to chat about.  We might do a bit more E3 in the next podcast, but who knows.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “G-Money” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>So, it is another week of the Aeropodcast, but this time we flip it around a bit, as we have some live interviews from the show floor of the Major League Gaming event that was held in Ohio a few weeks ago.  Our man of mystery, Mike Koss braved the lack of deodorant and Doritos dust to talk with some players in the MLG, and a strange toilet paper story that I am still in the dark about.

<title>Aeropodcast Special Edition: Mid-Week E3 Update</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2010/06/aeropodcast-special-edition-mid-week-e3-update/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/E3_wrap_day_3.mp3</guid>
<description>So this week, after one of the many long days at E3, Fourhman decided to get out of bed early one morning on the East Coast and hook up with Haygood for a walk in the park to smell the roses.  No….wait….uh, I mean to podcast, yeah, that’s right, to podcast.  And why and early week podcast?  Well, because of a little gaming event we like to call E3 Expo.  Yep, on Wednesday, June 16th, Fourhman and Haygood got together for a little over an hour after the day’s events to what they had read or seen at E3 that impressed them or left them a bit under the weather.

Note for all that decide to download this.  We recorded this in Pamela to make sure we could get it out to the people as fast as possible.  This also means there is no editing of the podcast in any way.  You will hear swearing, cats, wives and cat food throughout the podcast.  We feel it just adds to the ambiance of the podcast for the evening.

So sit back and enjoy a slice of E3.

<itunes:subtitle>Aeropodcast Special Edition: Mid-Week E3 Update</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>So this week, after one of the many long days at E3, Fourhman decided to get out of bed early one morning on the East Coast and hook up with Haygood for a walk in the park to smell the roses.  No….wait….uh, I mean to podcast, yeah, that’s right, to podcast.  And why and early week podcast?  Well, because of a little gaming event we like to call E3 Expo.  Yep, on Wednesday, June 16th, Fourhman and Haygood got together for a little over an hour after the day’s events to what they had read or seen at E3 that impressed them or left them a bit under the weather.

Note for all that decide to download this.  We recorded this in Pamela to make sure we could get it out to the people as fast as possible.  This also means there is no editing of the podcast in any way.  You will hear swearing, cats, wives and cat food throughout the podcast.  We feel it just adds to the ambiance of the podcast for the evening.

So sit back and enjoy a slice of E3.

<description>This week, the two Joe’s are completely missing in action for the podcast, but it was more than made up for with the addition of a couple of Munn’s.    Yes, Stephen and Paul both make their return to the podcast in style, talking about what they have been playing for the last eight months.  Okay, not really, but they join Koss to talk some games, broken PS3’s and more.  So sit back and enjoy this Joe free podcast for the week, but don’t get comfortable, as it will not last!

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Magic Mike” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis

<title>Aeropodcast #137: Try not to record any podcasts on the way through the parking lot!</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast137_20100604.mp3</guid>
<description>So here we are with a late, but surprisingly good Aeropodcast for your listening ears.  It is a bit of a short show, but focuses on some of our reader mail, including a very long string of questions from Aeropause listener Jrittmayer.  He wants to know about sandwich favorites, superpowers and so much more, and we are happy to answer.  Remember boys and girls, we love to get your questions, and you don’t have to save them up for one huge outburst, all at the same time.  Also, feel free to use our voice mail for more verbal barbs and quips, as they will make the show.

Also, we have a programming note.  With E3 and some other real world stuff, Joe Haygood will be off of the podcast for a few weeks.  No, he is not leaving, and no, it was not a coup masterminded by the ever so quiet, yet drunk with power Mike Koss.  Nope, just E3, a wedding and a bachelor party that are all demanding his time.  In the meantime, you can look towards Koss, Fourhman and hopefully others filling in during his absence.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “DJ Kentaro” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #136: Gary Coleman Was Rude to Joe</title>

<description>This week's Aeropodcast, fell during a most distressing time.  An icon was lost this week, and his name was Gary Coleman.  From Different Strokes to Cash Call and woman beating, Gary lead all of us on a rollercoaster ride, and unfortunately, it ended far too soon.  Now, he can only hawk gold selling to the Pharohs in the afterlife.  Rock on Gary!

Back to podcasting, Koss, Fourhman and Joe talked up Project Ten Dollar and all of the other publishers that are jumping on board this initiative.  The discussion when from there to a discussion about the used games market in general and who is affected the most by used game sales.  It is probably the most contentious podcast discussion we have had in quite some time.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Funkenstein” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #135: Fourhman Offers to Punch Joe in the Wii</title>

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we talk a bit about the extension of the console generation and how it will affect users who undergo some form of loss with their consoles.  As you can tell, this extends from the frustration of Joe Haygood's loss of his 360 (and now his PS3), and other items like a Wii dying and swapping games and of course, sealed controllers for the PS3.  How are you going to replace those batteries when they start to die?  That's right, you will not.

Also, Skype was being a little bitch for the podcast, so it cuts off rather abruptly as we were finally disconnected, never to join again for the evening.  We are going through some technical challeges with Skype, and we hope that you will try to enjoy us through these difficulties.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen “Scatman” Munn, and features “Droid Girl”, performed by Lazyitis.

<description>This week on the slightly delayed Aeropodcast, Fourhman and Haygood talk up shop about E3 and what they think will be shown off this year.  Some of the guesses this year include Zelda, Pikmin, price cuts, lots of crappy motion titles and of course, the ever present Kingdom Hearts 3 prediction.  As a side note, we are also going to start taking bets on how many titles from Sony and Microsoft will include "Party" in the title.  Currently, we think about 80% of Sony and Microsoft's press meetings will be "Party" titled games.

<title>Aeropodcast #133: The AeroRapecast</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast133_20100507.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we were suppose to have a nice discussion about poor sequels and what made them so bad, but we got derailed at the beginning of our podcast the subject of Fourhman and his “husband”, Ben Roethlisberger, Lawrence Taylor and of course, rape.  Yeah, that sounds about as exciting as grass growing, but it is a bit entertaining.

Seriously however, we did finally get to our topic, and it was fun to look at some of the great game franchises that were made, only to be followed up by some horrible sequels.  Some of the franchises looked at include Neverwinter Nights, Sonic, Animal Crossing, and Pools of Radiance to name a few.  There were more, but you will have to listen in to hear them all.

<description>After another disasterous Friday night recording session, all of us went back to the drawing board an triple checked our setups to make sure that we could record on Saturday night.  Lo and behold, we can now lay all the blame on Linux.  Just kidding Koss.  Nope, it appears that whatever problems the lastest Skype update were causing went away, and we got in a solid podcast that talked about the controversy surrounding the latest media event for Capcom, and in general how site can handle getting these kind of kickbacks from the industry.  I think that we also defined what our policy is here at Aeropause regarding these kind of giveaways and events.

<title>Aeropodcast #131: This One Was Rough For Everybody</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast131_20100423.mp3</guid>
<description>Sometimes, we like to joke that our podcast is completely horrible.  As a matter of fact most podcasters seem to think that.  That said, all of us are probably going to go out on a limb and say that this might not be the Aeropodcast at its finest.  We had all kinds of Skype issues, disconnects, drops and lots of times where we could not hear one another.  I would like to give Skype the big finger this week for another update that breaks the simple process of putting together a call.

As for the actual podcast.  Well, when we were actually able to get a stable discussion going, we talked up franchises and when they move to completely different genres.  XCOM, Fallout and others were brought up during the discussion.  Oh yeah, Sonic and Mario made an appearance as well, but you can probably figure out where each one fell in the discussion of good or bad.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we look at open world games and what exactly makes a great open world title.  Some of the games we hold up to the microscope include Just Cause 2, the GTA games, Saints Row 2, and even non-traditional open world titles like Burnout Paradise.  We also look at a few forum threads and of course, go off tangent at least once.

<title>Aeropodcast #129: If You Only Knew</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast129_20100409.mp3</guid>
<description>This week's podcast is probably more about what you did not hear on the podcast rather than what you will actually hear.  What you missed was Haygood, running into his house after sitting in traffic similar to the picture above for three hours coming back from an event for our site.  It was also about Fourhman discussing how long it takes him to go 80 miles in traffic vs. those of us in sunny Southern California.  Oh, we also talked about the event in question, which is under embargo until April 22nd.  Teaser and foreshadowing, combined.

The podcast does feature feedback, user questions, what Haygood and Fourhman are playing and a few relevant forum threads.  There was also some feedback on the Shadowrun Community Playdate.

The podcast was mixed, by Stephen "DJ Atomica East Coast" Munn, and features "Droid Girl", performed by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #128: The Fourhman Show</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast128_20100402.mp3</guid>
<description>This week, due to Easter and the Aeropause Community Game Night, we did not have enough staff to put together a fully functioning podcast.  That said, our very own Fourhman did not want you to go away for a whole week empty handed.  So he put together, his own attempt at being DJ Atomica for a half hour or so.

No other news or what not this week, and as always, make sure to review us on iTunes.  50 reviews will kick off our drawing for one new retail game up to $60 in price.

<title>Aeropodcast #127: It’s Getting Steamy in Here</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2010/03/aeropodcast-127-its-getting-steamy-in-here/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast127_20100326.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we look at a topic that came up a few weeks ago, which is the idea of bringing Steam to the Apple platform.  We look at what the technical aspects are for the service, including what Valve will support, as well as the ability for third parties to support the platform.  Also, where to this announcement then take gaming on the Apple platform as well as Steam to other platforms, like Linux.

We also tackle Game Room and how bad the experience was for one of our podcasters.  And as a bonus, find out how awesome Combat looks in super high definition.

The podcast was put together by Stephen “Jazzy Jeff” Munn and features the track, “Droid Girl” by Lazyitis.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, our own Fourhman brought a topic to the table for discussion this week, so if it sucks, blame him.  Seriously, it was a pretty good point of discussion, as we looked at the new accessories and so forth that are coming out in the second half of the year, comparing them to a mini-console relaunch.

So if you want to see who is down with the Playstation Move, or getting jiggy with Project Natal, tune in to get all the answers.  And just to add emphasis to our picture this week, remember the phrase, "You know it is true".  It will make you feel dirtier.

The podcast was put together by Stephen “Kid Sensation” Munn and features the track, “Droid Girl” by Lazyitis.

<title>Aeropodcast #125: Heavy Rain Spoilercast</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast125_20100313.mp3</guid>
<description>After a few days of delay, Aeropodcast 125 is ready for your listening pleasure, and it is a doozey.  Coming in at over two hours, we go through most of Heavy Rain, spoiling the crap out of it at every possible turn.  We talk plot points, story ending and more.

The discussion delves into what was good, and what did not work so well, and we even get some insight into Haygood's "disturbing" moment in the game.  Vikki joins in on the discussion as well, adding a British flair along with the regular podcast compatriots of Koss and Fourhman.

At the end, we also give the game what we would have rated it, and you might be surprised by the scores, both good and bad.

The podcast was put together by Stephen “TerminatorX” Munn and features the track, “Droid Girl” by Lazyitis.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/Aeropodcast124_20100305.mp3</guid>
<description>This week, we look at the recent firing of Jason West and Vince Zampalla from Infinity Ward, and question whether a designer or CEO can be bigger than their brand.  Some of the people that we look at include Ken Levine, David Jaffe, John Romero, John Carmack and others.

Also, Haygood laments the fact that Kevin Conroy is not the voice of Batman in the most recent DC Universe animated movies.  This of course, leads into a discussion about Batman: Arkham Asylum and the apparent outbreak of 'Roids in Gotham City.  We also talk about some of our big forum topics, as well as a new segment about show feedback.

The podcast was put together by Stephen “DJ Eddie B” Munn and features the track, “Droid Girl” by Lazyitis.

<description>This is probably the last time that you will get to see Fourhman’s wonderful a-bomb Photoshop work, but we at Aeropause thought the recent issues with Sony’s console deserved a quick podcast.  It is a bit informal, but we just talk about what happened and how we as PS3 owners felt about it.  Listen in and enjoy.

The podcast was put together by Stephen “8-Ball” Munn and features the track, “Apocalypse Please” by Muse.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we take a look at religion and how it is used in video games.  Specific examples range from Little King’s Story, to Jade Empire, Dragon Age: Origins and even Mass Effect 2.  It was interesting to see that neither myself or Fourhman necessarily upset with religion being in games, as long as it has context.

We also have a little fun with some of the lesser known religious titles that have been created in the past for gamers, including Left Behind, and the ever popular Bibleman.

As always, the podcast is mixed together by our very own Stephen “DJ Yella” Munn and his very own wheels of steel.  Our bumper music, Droid Girl, is provided by Lazyitis, so make sure to visit their MySpace page.

<description>This week on the podcast, we talk about gaming and the world of 3D.  Is 3D the wave of the gaming future, or is it just another ill-fated fad that will go the way of the Power Glove.  Some of us think back to 3D gaming and PCs back 15 years ago, while some of us also see the issue of the glasses themselves.  Where do we end up on this topic.  Tune in to find out.

Also, we have a huge community corner this week, with a rapid fire section, questions about where we would go in the world, and which one of us gets sent on the suicide mission.

As always, the podcast is mixed together by our very own Stephen “Joe Cooley” Munn and his very own wheels of steel.  Our bumper music, Droid Girl, is provided by Lazyitis, so make sure to visit their MySpace page.

<description>Another week, another Aeropodcast, and this time we decided that we would try to cut down the preamble a bit, due to our podcast getting a bit on the long side.  However, we did not get the memo on time constraints, and ended up never getting to our topic, due to taking forever to cover the games we are playing.

That said, we did get in a lot of discussion on Assassins Creed 1 and 2, Mass Effect 2, and a few more digs at Stephen's purchase of an Xbox 360.

Somehow, in the midst of all this game talk, we did get a chance to talk about the new site design, which is totally awesome, along with the latest in forum topics.

Also, we take some time to go into the forums and bring up a few of the new threads that have popped up here and there, especially one in particular, which ended up bringing a former 360 Heretic into the fold of good gaming.  ZING!

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we had Joe and Joe discussing the insane numbers that Nintendo did during the month of December.  The fact that the Nintendo Wii outsold the PS3, PS2, PSP and Xbox 360 combined was amazing.   We also went back in time and reminisced about our very own Koss and his thoughts on the Wii’s sale trends through the holiday season.  It was not pretty.

Also, we had a discussion about community, as we noticed a lot more of our listeners hitting up the forums this week, and that is great.  However, we stressed the need for more of our listeners to show up and take part in a growing community.

As always, the podcast is mixed together by our very own Stephen “Kid Capri” Munn and his very own wheels of steel.  Our bumper music, Droid Girl, is provided by Lazyitis, and make sure to visit their MySpace page.

<description>This week, the Aeropodcast brings in another guest, but not just any guest.  How about a guest that has been voice game characters for over a decade now.  Yes, our guest this week was the lovely and talented Jennifer Hale. 

Jennifer was nice enough to spend about a half hour with us, and talk about her role in Mass Effect and its sequel, about grunting for Samus and how horseback riding and Totally Spies could be interlinked.  For even more amusement, listen as Fourhman almost has a moment on the podcast during said tale of horseback riding.

After our guest had to depart, we talk about what we have been playing, a small bit on NPDs and we get to our forum predictions, which we totally forgot to read last week.  It is all great stuff.  Now if we could only get some voice mails to our new number, we would be on cloud nine.

Stephen “Dre” Munn put the podcast together this week, and our “Droid Girl” bumper music is brought to you by Lazyitis.  Make sure to visit their MySpace page.

<description>Well, another week, another exciting Aeropodcast, and this week we even have a special guest for Aeropodcast #116, Luis AKA SoldierX25 from the Post Game Report Podcast.

This week, we want everyone to take note of this podcast, as all of us give our bold predictions for gaming in 2010.  What shocking picks are made by our panel this week?  What obvious choices are brought up?  Does anyone decide to go all crazy and say that there will be a Rogue Warrior 2 in 2010?  Oh wait, isn’t that Aliens vs. Predator?  These questions and oh so many more are answered inside. 

As always, special thanks to Stephen “Sir Scratch A Lot” Munn for putting this week’s podcast together.  Also a big thanks to SoldierX25 for taking time out of his busy achievement grabbing schedule to sit with us for an hour and a half.  And of course, make sure to visit the Lazyitis page, the provider of our Droid Girl theme.

<description>Yes, we are late in getting the podcast up this week, but it is totally worth it, as it is probably one of the most entertaining podcasts from us in two weeks.  Listen as we talk about what we got over the holidays, Steam, and how Stephen’s mic totally works now.  Also, we laugh at one of us getting called out for a fight at work.

Once again, props to Stephen “Mixmaster” Munn for putting the podcast together, and to Lazyitis for our “Droid Girl” bumper music.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast114_20091219.mp3</guid>
<description>Part two of the Aeropodcast awards show is here for your listening pleasure.  Find out how many more categories Resident Evil 5 could possibly be nominated for.  Also, listen in fear as we try to pick our coaster of the year.  And finally, be amazed as we pick a truly great title for Game of the Year.

And just for all of you decade junkies, we did not do a game of the decade award, because the decade does not end until the end of 2010!

Time to give huge props to Stephen “MC Scratch” Munn for mixing  this enormous podcast, and for all the podcasts he has put together.  Again, thank you to Fourhman, Koss, Vikki and Adam for spending four hours of their lives participating in this podcast.  It was epic, and I cannot wait to do it again next year.  Also, props to Lazyitis for providing out new bumper music.  We will have more from them throughout the year.  Make sure to visit their website and give them some digital hi-fives.

<title>Aeropodcast 113: Shaven Souls are Beautiful Things</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2009/12/aeropodcast-113-shaven-souls-are-beautiful-things/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast113_20091219.mp3</guid>
<description>This week, we finally have the big discussion of the year, which focuses on all things Best of in gaming.  That’s right, it is time for the first annual Aeropause Game Awards podcast, and it is so full of awesomeness, that it takes two podcasts to contain its greatness.

To give a small rundown, we started with our normal segments of covering the info for the show, along with what we are playing this week.  Then we moved on to the first three award categories, which were Best Shooter, Best Action/Adventure and Best RPG titles.  There are some notable ommissions from our awards, but some of that may be that we try to keep it to things that we have played, or at the very least, have played a demo.

Keep your eyes peeled for Part two of this podcast some time next week.  After that, we will be taking a weekend off for New Years, and we should be back recording on January 8th.

As always, we thank Stephen “MixMaster” Munn for assembling this huge monstrosity of a podcast.  It was four hours of recording and he had to edit and break it into two shows.  Kudos to him for his unseen work and toil.  Also, thank you to all the guests that we have had on in the last year.  And finally, thank you to all the people that have co-hosted and hosted the podcast in the last 12 months.  Fourhman, Koss, Vikki, Adam, Stephen and Paul, you guys are great, and make podcasting each week a lot of fun.  If you like the music from the podcast, visist the Lazyitis page on MySpace for more info on the band.

<title>Aeropodcast #112: Straight Outta Rogue Warrior</title>
<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2009/12/aeropodcast-112-straight-outta-rogue-warrior/</link>
<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast112_20091211.mp3</guid>
<description>This week, the Aeropodcast does delve into a strong topic, that was brought up by our very own Joe Fourhman.  We talked about the possibility of Nintendo and Sony looking at their handheld titles and the possibility of being able to play them on your main console, ie, Wii or PS3.  We also hit up the recent NPD numbers and how many tons of copies Modern Warfare 2 sold.

But all of that really pales in comparison to the best part of this podcast, and that is the fact that parts of it are voiced over by Mickey Rourke.  I would say that he did specific voice work for us, but it is actually from Rogue Warior.  We had a review for the game go up on the site, and the dialog should speak to the quality of the game.

And yes, this podcast is rated M for mature, due to said Mickey Rourke clips.

The podcast was mixed up by Stephen Munn, and features the music of Lazyitis.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, the crew talks up the importance of a great soundtrack in a game.  Each writer talks about his own favorite soundtracks from video games, and how they helped shape their gameplay experience.  Also, find out which member of the Aeropodcast never listened to a game soundtrack until 2004.

We also have another rousing round of Rapid Fire that cannot be missed, along with community participation.  Also, the writers make a case to the listeners to become part of the podcast community.  We know how many people listen, but we would love to have more of those people contribute to the podcast on a weekly basis.  This is the community’s show, so make it part of your community stops each week and participate.  We will be nice, and we have had all of our shots

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast110_20091127.mp3</guid>
<description>There are good podcasts, and there are bad podcasts.  For you Aeropodcast listeners, this one is probably the worst podcast from us ever.  I mean first off, Stephen is on it.  Then there is the fact that there are two more losers, Joe and Joe that both went to Old Navy at 0-Dark Thirty to get a game for free.  And of course, what else can we say about Koss.

Actually, we do go over some of the deals that we hit up while still digesting Turkey.  And as mentioned in the first paragraph, see what happens when people decide to go insane and stay out all night in a quest to get Lego Rock Band.  We also had a public service announcement about some issues that came up with Media Temple this weekend.  Lastly, I would just like to add one important nugget of wisdom to this post – That’s What Your Mom Said!

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast109_20091121.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the mighty Aeropodcast, we take a break from serious issues to find ways for all of you listeners to save money on your gaming purchases this Black Friday.  For the uninitiated, Black Friday is named after the day that retailers normally end up going into the black for their year end profits.  For shoppers, Black Friday has come to mean ridiculous deals that require people to wait outside stores for umpteen hours, while trying not to trample someone to death when the store opens.

Our deals cover the gamut, from DS to PSP and all of the major consoles.  As a matter of fact we even hit a few PC deals, so no one is left out.  If you think we missed a good deal, make sure you leave it in the comments, so everyone can get in on the best deals of the day.  Also, take note that a lot of stores will price match, but they will want to see the advertisement, so make sure to pick up a paper on Wednesday and Thursday of this week, so you make sure you get all the relevant ads.

Lastly, Koss put together a rapid fire section, which was highly entertaining.  If you want more rapid fire sessions, make sure to send them in or post them in the forums.  As always, the podcast is mixed together by our great DJ Hero, Stephen Munn, and stars the music of Lazyitis.  The band has a shout out for all Aeropause fans, so go over there and check out their MySpace page.

<title>Aeropodcast #108: The Day The Music Died</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast108_20091113.mp3</guid>
<description>This week, some guy that says he is Koss, returns to the podcast to join Fourhman and Joe to talk up the latest NPD numbers.  Yes, we look at Uncharted 2, Brutal Legend, basketball titles and the success (or lack thereof) of musical titles this month.

Also, how does a little title like Halo ODST keep its numbers looking sharp from its stellar debut.  Also, we head off on a few tangents about TV, reviews at work, and of course Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

This week, we have some new music brought to you by the sounds of Alan Paz and his band, Lasyitis.  The title of the track is “Droid Girl”.  Still the same, and mashing it all together as he does each week is our mixologist, Stephen “Han Solo shoots first” Munn.

<itunes:subtitle>Aeropodcast #108: The Day The Music Died</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>This week, some guy that says he is Koss, returns to the podcast to join Fourhman and Joe to talk up the latest NPD numbers.  Yes, we look at Uncharted 2, Brutal Legend, basketball titles and the success (or lack thereof) of musical titles this month.

Also, how does a little title like Halo ODST keep its numbers looking sharp from its stellar debut.  Also, we head off on a few tangents about TV, reviews at work, and of course Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.

This week, we have some new music brought to you by the sounds of Alan Paz and his band, Lasyitis.  The title of the track is “Droid Girl”.  Still the same, and mashing it all together as he does each week is our mixologist, Stephen “Han Solo shoots first” Munn.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we talk about more of the controversy surrounding Infinity Ward and the decisions they have been making as of late.  We look at the whole “Friends Against Grenade Spam” and the consolification of the series on PC.  You can also hear Haygood go ballistic to the point of the censor button.

We also take a quick peak at Joe’s purchase of the AO version of Manhunt 2 on the PC, and the fact that Rockstar actually took a bit of time to bring the game over to the PC.  We also break into discussion about AO titles and their future on the console, which did not look all that bright.

Our podcast is mixed together by the one and only DJ Magic Munn, and backed up by the music of Revolution Void.  You can find their tunes over at www.revolutionvoid.com.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we go the community service route and explain the pain and suffering that one can have from Kidney Stones and Gall Stones.  Well, we only hit on this for a few minutes, but remember kids, drink plenty of water.

From there, we end up discussing one of the controversies that has beset Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, which would be the terrorist mission.  Is it too soon for this kind of mission to be available to play in a game, or are we being too sensitive as a society?  We also look at things like Vietnam based games and other situations where gamers and deveolpers have had trouble dealing with historical events.

We also have some great stuff from the community, including a return of a regular community member, XCWarrior, who wants to know a few things.

As always, our podcast is produced by Stephen "Grandmaster Flash" Munn, and features music from Revolution Void.  You can find their music at www.revolutionvoid.com.

<description>This week, the Aeropodcast team is back, and we decided to tackle the idea of stereotypes in games.  How have we been affeccted by stereotypes in our daily life when it comes to our hobby showing up.  Have we run into moments of awkward silenece and shame?  Or is it just business as normal.  And with Vikki on the show, is it even worse for a girl to put her foot in the gaming waters, or does she just get stares that are twice as difficult to deal with.

We also have a full community corner with a rapid fire session provided by community groupie, Jordan Snyder, as well as a walk down game menu memory lane with a question from Lundy3311.

And to keep the podcast high class, we had a moment of British nostalgia as Joe remembers Beanos’, Boots department stores and the ever lovable Yorkie bar.  However, we must always remember that Yorkies are not for girls!

The podcast music as always, is brought to you from Revolution Void, and their songs can be found at www.revolutionvoid.com.  The podcast is mixed by resident DJ, Stephen “Trance” Munn.

<title>Aeropodcast #104 – Fourhman Phones It In</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast104_20091016.mp3</guid>
<description>With the podcast down one man this week, we decided to hit up the community for some topics.  However, one of those comments from one Jordan Snyder, drew Fourhman out from the House of Mouse to call in and retort.  To say it is epic is selling it short.

We also took the time to sit discuss some of the recent hulabaloo on the web surrounding the complaints over the recent scores that Uncharted 2 has received from some media outlets.  Yes, you read that right, people have been complaining about 9.3, 9.4 and 4.5 out of 5 scores.  We just found it interesting that a game that has reviewed so well, is still getting complaints over the review scores being so low.

The podcast music is provided by Revolution Void and they can be found at www.revolutionvoid.com.  The podcast is mixed as always by our favorite DJ, Stephen “stop clearing your throat already, Joe” Munn.

<description>This week, the Aeropodcast went over a topic that had been a thorn in my side for some time, and that is the idea of purchasing all of these great XBLA, PSN and Steam games that end up just collecting dust on our hard drives.  Are we captured by the hype of a game hitting the marketplace, jumping on it, or is the investment of $60 in a full retail title trumping our dedication to these smaller titles.

This week, we ran rather long on the main topic, so we skipped the community corner, but you will be happy to know that this upcoming podcast will feature nothing but community content, so if you have questions, get them in before Friday at 7PM Pacific time.  You can email them at tips@aeropause.com, post them in the forum in the Aeropodcast question topic, or phone them in via our voice mail at 206-339-8362.

The podcast was mixed by Stephen Munn, using music from Revolution Void.  Look for it at www.revolutionvoid.com.

<description>A big apology for this podcast getting to press so late.  Real life has been getting in the way of things for the last week and a half, but things are getting better.  And believe me, beyond a technical issue for this podcast, it is well worth the wait.  Why is that you say?  Well, we had our writer from the UK, Vikki, making an appearance on the show.  So for once, we have a really good English accent on the show, although a really bad accent shows up as well at one point.

Features in this podcast include shopping for good, not so cutesy DS and DSi games, and the Xbox 360 and PC Ones to Watch titles, so it was not a fanboy oversight that they were not on the site.

Music is provided by Revolution Void, and mixed as always by Stephen Munn.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast,  Josh, aka Crash from The Gamers Garage joined Fourhman and Joe to talk shop about all things video gaming related.  This week, our topic focused on two major items.  First we discussed the game lose/lose, and how this game could end up causing serious detrimental harm to a computer.  Is the game art, or just a cleverly disguised virus?  We also took a look at the new Nintendo Wii price cut and if it will have a bump or serious sales spike on the NPD numbers.  There was also mention of a rebate for the Xbox 360 Elite package that would lower its effective price to $250.

As always, we have community corner with lots of good questions, notable articles, and of course, what are we all playing.  Also,  what does "orangutang afterbirth" have to do with anything?  Find out inside.

We talked about boss battles, Batman, and our best and worst experiences behind working with the podcast.  I was joined by my wingmen in recording, Fourhman and Koss in this recording.  Also, I would like to say thank you to Koss, Fourhman, George Walker, Shane Whitehouse, Richard Windsor, Levi Thornton, Paul Munn, James Munn and Stephen Munn for coming on during one or more episodes and making this show possible.  An extra special thanks to our Mixmaster, Stephen Munn for finding ways to make all of us look good, and salvaging some big problems and making gold out of them.

<title>Aeropodcast #99: The Good, The Bad, and the NPDs</title>

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, Koss, Fourhman and Joe looked at the August NPD numbers to see how the PS3 and 360 price cuts did for the last few days of that month, along with the surprisingly strong numbers for one flying rat.  Also, we look at the slight drop in the Madden franchise, that left Joe wondering if Madden was finally reaching its tipping point with its fans.

From there, Fourhman and Joe decided to discuss their feelings about The Beatles: rock Band and how it has not lived up to their visions of what the series could be.  The two of them also wonder if they are living in a parallel universe, as they seem to be the only ones that have been kind of down on the game.  Koss had not bought the game yet, so see if the pair's discussion swayed him for or against the title.

Also, it was mentioned that our illustrious Fourhman would be putting together a flipnote cartoon while we recorded the podcast, and you can see the above results.  All of the animations came from reader suggestions in the forums.  If you would like us to do more things like this, let us know.  We are considering playing a multiplayer title while we are on the podcast live, so maybe you can make a PS3 suggestion, since that seems to be about the only common denominator.

<description>Mike, Stephen, Fourhman and Joe join together in unison to fight for justice, truth and the podcasting way, protecting citizens from scum and villany.  Okay, not really, but we did have a great discussion on the uniformed pricing of titles on the current generation of consoles.

Our discussion looks at whether certain titles could have benefited from a lower starting price point vs. the standard $59.99 price tag that almost all Xbox 360 and PS3 games are hit with.  Some of the titles mentioned include WET,  50 Cent: Blood on the Sand and Wolverine: Origins.  We took a short look at Nintendo as well, considering that they have been a bit more flexible as of late with pricing, having titles come out at $50 and $30 on a regular basis.  But some titles still left us wondering what developers were thinking, like Mad World or Deadly Creatures and their full price point.

We also received a couple of questions from Forum member william745, and we are always looking for more.  Make sure to leave us a voice mail at 206-339-8362, email us at tips@aeropause.com or post up in our forums.  The community is only as strong as its members, so join the forum community and delve into our post history.  Remember to review us on iTunes and let us know how we are doing.  As always, the podcast is put together by the sound alchemist, Stephen Munn, and features music from Revolution Void.

<title>Aeropodcast #97: No News is Good News</title>

<description>This week, the Aeropodcast goes through a few changes to cut down on the time, because at the end of the day, all of us realize that people do not want a two hour podcast.  It is okay when it happens on occasion, but as of late, two hours seems to have been the norm.

The biggest change is that we have dropped the news section.  Our podcast is meant to be a podcast that has all of us as joint hosts, and the news section normally has me rambling, with the occasional note or correction from my co-hosts for the week.  It normally does not bring a lot of discussion, and I want our podcast to be a joint effort, with everyone participating.  Hopefully you like this decision, and while this week does not reflect the cut down in length due to a meaty topic, you should see podcasts come down to a more drivetime like experience.  We are shooting for under one and a half hours at most.

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we have a special treat, as two guests stopped by to record a show with us this week.  And who were the two guests, brave enough to run almost two hours with us?  Why, that would be Kelly and Chris, hosts of The Married Gamers podcast.

With our guests, we had a discussion about the new announcements from Sony hit Gamescom, and what they would do for them coming into the busy Christmas season.  Does the price cut give Sony solid footing for the holiday season, and can they keep up with the possible demand from this new price.  Also, are we upset about the final nail in the coffin for backwards compatibility.

We also covered a full slate of news, community corner items and even a few random topics, like what happens if you are a female and venture on Uno with other users and their cameras.  The results are hilarious.

<title>Aeropodcast #95: The Ballad of Sid Caesar</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast95_20090814.mp3</guid>
<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, we look at how the new remakes stack up with gamers that remember the classics vs. the newer gamers that may or may not appreciate the older style.  Well, we sort of talk about that.  You see, we sort of went through some ADD moments in the beginning of the topic, resulting in chats about GI Joe, COBRA, comics and somehow, Sid Caeser.  Trust me, it is well worth the price of admission.

We also got to show off our street cred as we were asked about Ice Cube and our feelings on his work.  Well, SOME of us were able to discuss it, while others seemed to think he was on SVU.  Next week, someone ask about Ice T. so we can correct this fault.  Mix in some news and another voice mail on top of the Ice Cube deal and you have a jam packed podcast.

The podcast is put together by our very master of the ones and twos, Stephen Munn.  If you enjoy the podcast, please review it on iTunes, and tell a friend.  Also, continue to call into the podcast with your voice mail questions at 206-339-8362, email us at tips@aeropause.com or post in our Questions thread in the forums.

<title>Aeropodcast #94: What's a Voice Mail</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast94_20090807.mp3</guid>
<description>This week, Koss, Fourhman and Joe get the first voice mail on the show ever.  Well, technically it is the third we have received, but the prank call did not count, and we accidentally deleted the first try at voice mail ever on the show.  Our own resident Aerofan, Jordan Snyder, joins us with a question about the holiday release season, as well as some flamebait for Wii fans.

As for our topic, Fourhman brought to the table, a discussion about avatars and the whole idea of creating a self-image in a virtual world to represent you.  We look at when we first decided to create an image of ourself, as well as where we think the trend came from and where it is going.

We also have a full plate of news, community corner items and site coverage that we hope you will listen into.  If you enjoy the show, make sure to give us a review on iTunes by following the link at the end of this post.  Also, feel free to email us at tips@aeropause.com, hit us up in the forums in the podcast question thread or just call us via the voice mail line at 206-339-8362.  The Aeropodcast is put together by our resident mixologist, Stephen Munn, and features the music of Revolution Void.

<title>Aeropodcast #93: When In Doubt, Go for the Fire Hose</title>

<description>This week, the Aeropodcast takes a change from its normal format to cover a few smaller topics instead of one earthshaking item.  Koss, Fourhman and Joe look at a topic that has been delayed for a few weeks, looking at what gaming character could represent us in real life.  The choices are all over the place, including Disaster Report.  You have to ask yourself if Fourhman would have been the guy that respected the woman's privacy, or looked up the skirt.

We also looked a little bit at the new Xbox update that for the most part has nothing beyond putting up how long you have been an Xbox Live member, the new Netflix functionality and a revamped achievement card display.  No Twitter, Facebook last.fm or any of the other items that we were hoping for, but they are suppose to be coming soon.  Fourhman also gave us the scoop on how the Watchmen BD Live session went and what he got out of it.  We do know his intellectual questions went unanswered.  We told him he should have asked about the sex scene.

We also have a full session of community corner, news and other banter that we know the listeners have come to love.  If you have any questions for us, visit the questions thread in the forums, email us at tips@aeropause.com and of course, give us a voice mail question or shout out at 206-339-8362.  Also, if you like or hate the podcast, click the iTunes link at the end of the podcast post and give us a review.  We appreciate all the feedback, as it helps improve the show.  The show is mixed by our turntable master, Stephen Munn.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast92_200907247.mp3</guid>
<description>This week, we decided to press rewind as Fourhman and Joe decided to go back in time to chat up last week's topic a bit more, after Joe went on an arduous journey trying to buy Singstar songs from the U.K. store.  Learn more than you could possibly want to know about buying points, how to get stuff purchased from a foreign store and more importantly, will DLC from another region work with a different region's game.

We also went through some of our newest articles, including a sidebar discussion about storage and old school tips.  And in our hefty segment of news, we finished up with our take on the lastest and greatest publicity debacle with Dante's Inferno.

As always, our podcast is put together by our resident spinmaster, Stephen "Justice" Munn.

<description>This week was a crazy podcast that started off rather normal, but delved into the perverse due to one of our new topics dealing with Yakuza, a coctail waitress and squirting housewives.

We did manage to work our way down to our topic for the week, which talked abou the need for creating foreign accounts for consoles, so players can access other items that might not be available in their region.  It is an interesting discussion that might be expanged upon in this week's podcast with a bevy of new information.

We also had a ton of new questions from the community, who stepped up after Joe called them out in last week's podcast.  and of course we have our standard plate of news for the listeners.  The participants for this week's debacle are Joe, Mr. Fourhman, Koss and Paul Munn.

<description>Hello all of you Aeropause fans, we are back again with another great podcast for your listening pleasure.  This week, we take it easy, discussing some of our favorite and least favorite titles in our gaming history.  The choices will be surprising, but you know at some point, Vampire Rain will come up.  What's funny is that we almost changed the topic to Zelda vs. star Wars on the fly.  Why those two franchises?  Why not is the better question to ask.

Also, we have some great news stories, but unfortunately, a lack of community participation for this podcast.  Make sure to call in, email or post questions for the podcast community corner.  Also, with our 100th episode coming soon, what would you likae to hear in the weeks coming up to this Aeropodcast milestone?  Let us know.

<title>Aeropodcast #89: Michael Bay...Eject!</title>

<description>This week, all of us heard the feedback and we made sure to deliver with one of the longest podcasts on record for the Aeropause Crew.  This week we had a topic submitted by community member Harshy.  He wanted us to relate some of our gripes in the gaming industry.  Our gripes are all over theplace and I think we came up with a great list of stuff.  This inspiration for the topic came from a Wired Magazine article.

We also had our usual cadre of news and community feedback, but in a rare moment, Joe completely loses it over the latest Michael Bay flick, Transformers 2.  Is it a good flip out or bad?  Tune in to find out.

<itunes:subtitle>Aeropodcast #89: Michael Bay...Eject!</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>This week, all of us heard the feedback and we made sure to deliver with one of the longest podcasts on record for the Aeropause Crew.  This week we had a topic submitted by community member Harshy.  He wanted us to relate some of our gripes in the gaming industry.  Our gripes are all over theplace and I think we came up with a great list of stuff.  This inspiration for the topic came from a Wired Magazine article.

We also had our usual cadre of news and community feedback, but in a rare moment, Joe completely loses it over the latest Michael Bay flick, Transformers 2.  Is it a good flip out or bad?  Tune in to find out.

<description>Well, due to a terrible work week for your favorite host, Joe, we did not get a chance to record a most awesome podcast for your listening pleasure.  Yes, we know, we don't know how you will get through your week without our dulcette tones either, but you must try.

Well, actually, you won't because we did record a little something to get you through till the next Aeropodcast.  Joe and Fourhman recorded a short little segment that should be enough to entertain you for a week.

As for what it could be?  Well, i would be lying if I didn't say that it involved Joe and Fourhman, dramatic reading and possibly a review or two, but don't take my word for it.  Queue up iTunes, the Zune Marketplace (Well at least for a few of you), or even just hit the Podtrac Player, for we are here to entertain you, the fans.

<description>Well, when you have to include mention of Marky mark and the Funky Bunch, you might be scraping at the bottom of the podcast barrel, but no, the Aeropodcast crew still stands tall in the face of Mark Wahlberg's attempts at taking us down a peg.

This week, Fourhman, Koss and Joe take a look at social networking sites and wy it has taken them so long to migrate into the gaming marketplace.  We also look at gaming specific sites like Raptr and GamerDNA, that offer content that is specific to gamers.  The discussion also becomes a mini gripefest with the lack of things like updating signature cards, and Raptr integration when it comes to PS3 owners.

We skipped out on questions this week, because we were running a bit long, but in a preview of next week, we have a voicemail, so make sure to tune in for that.  As for the news, we did look at Activision giving Sony the thumbs down, Olivia Munn posing non-nude in Playboy and even Mortal Kombat making a return as an M-rated title.

<title>Aeropodcast #86: Did He Just Say Scheisse Porn?</title>

<description>This week on the Aeropodcast, it was the Fourhman and Joe show as they discussed all things Left 4 Dead and the timing of sequels.  It seems that there has been a rather large uproar over the idea that valve would want to go all Activision on one of their franchises and release a sequel about a year after the first Left 4 Dead, so we both looked at the timing of this and other sequels and why we get into such a frenzy over the timing of a sequel.

Also, we talk about the numerous itmes that were on the site in regards to E3 and we get a helpful email from readers/listener Kyle, in regards to how to get certain trophies/achievements in Rock Band 2.  We had one question this week that delved into the motion camera systems coming from both Sony and Microsoft, and if we had a preference for either one.  The resulting answers will shock you.

in the news, we look at the nuts over at 1up that feel that Project Natal is actually a new, upgraded Xbox 360 console, turning the device into a low cost gaming PC, Dungeons and Dragons going free at last and why is Max Payne looking so much like Obadiah Stone in Iron Man?  And yes, I thought about going with nude Zoey pics for the article, but that would make it too easy for you perverts.

<description>With E3 2009 coming to a close, Koss, Fourhman and Joe decide to give a post mortem on what came out of the big gaming event of the year.

We took a look at the big three and rate their press conferences, while also giving a rundown on the bigger titles for each platform.  Joe also gives a bit of flavor from the show floor and looks for sympathy from the crowd.  Of course, there will be none of that on an Aeropodcast.

Finally, we also give a bit of discussion on the new format for E3 and whether it was a hit of a miss.  Obviously, it could not of been that bad, as the Expo has already announced dates for next year's E3, coming June 15-17, 2010.  Book your rooms now as they will fill up fast!

<description>As fearless leader Joe makes his final preparations for the comback gaming event, E3, Koss and Fourhman are left to man the helm.  Lukily, they were able to keep the boat afloat and bring you another adventure from the Aeropause high seas.

This week, the topic of discussion hinges around games requiring a separate peripheral to play.  Are the peripherals necessary?  Are the costs too high?  Have we seen the end of peripherals, or do some games deserve a turn.  Listen in to find the answers.

Also this week, we have two new iTunes reviews, as well as some pertinent news items, including Noby Noby Girl making it to Mars, EGM returning to the newsstands, and The Matrix Online being shut down.  Don't miss out on our attempt at IGN's MadLib for Nintendo's E3 Press Conference.

As always, the podcast is brought to you via the mixing of Stephen Munn and with music by Revolution Void.

<title>Aeropodcast #83: Joe Busts a Cap in Nintendo’s Ass</title>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast83_20090523.mp3</guid>



<description>This week, Koss, Fourhman and Joe sit down to talk about everything E3.  We each talk up what we think will show there, what we are looking forward to seeing and what we will be covering at E3 2009. 

Some of the items mentioned are Mass Effect 2, big games from Nintendo (their proven franchises returning), Kingdom Hearts, Halo ODST, Gears 3, Alpha Protocol, the Zune 360 and more innovation with the Xbox Live service.  Somehow Miyamoto is relevant, along with the picture to the left, but you have to listen to find out how it all ties together.

We have a couple of questions for the community corner, and talk up a few things on the site, including our Good Old Games contests.  In the news we look at Warner Brothers wanting to gobble up Midway, Punch Out fan service and Terminator Salvation being broken at launch for the PC.

As always, the podcast is mixed by the master of the wheels of steel, Stephen Munn and features the music of Revolution Void.

<title>Aeropodcast #82: The Abomination</title>

<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2009/05/aeropodcast-82-the-abomination/</link>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast82_20090516.mp3</guid>



<description>After joking about it several times, the Aeropodcast gang decided to jump in, voice first, into the podcast from Playstation Home, aka “The Homecast”.  Joe was joined by Koss, Fourhman and our mixmaster Stephen to put together a podcast that may not be worthy of your listening pleasure.

Our normal intro was there live from the Central Plaza, where people made fun of us several times over for doing horrible dances.  Then we went to different lands, with Fourhman going to Siren Land, Stephen going to The Mall, Koss heading out to Sully’s Bar in Uncharted Land and myself heading over to The Godfather Land.  From there the podcast decends into hilarity as we try to get the Home community to interact with our podcast.  RBK had the lines of the night when he aaid, “Home needs more to do, better integration with games, and better branding.”  It is paraphrased a bit, but you get the general vibe for how people felt about home.

We covered a few news items, hit up some questions in the community corner and read a couple reviews, but at the end of the night, we just ended up dancing horribly, while Fourhman did his best impression of the Biblical plague with raining RE5 bug jewelry upon all of us.  It is definitely one to remember, but we are not sure if that is a good or bad thing.  Next up, podcast from Animal Crossing.

Of course, our mixologist, Stephen Munn put this podcast together along with his photos.  You can see more photos in our other Podcast photo article.  Also, the music for this podcast is from Collective Soul.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast81_20090509.mp3</guid>



<description>This is a bit different Aeropodcast than we have done in the past.  There is not a lot of news and the topic is not even gaming related.  Myself and Mike Koss sit down to discuss what happened to the site, why it happened and what we are doing to make Aeropause.com better so these things to not happen to us in the future. 

We do discuss what both of us are playing and we mention that there was a new review, but it will be read in the following podcast.  We did take a few minutes to discuss 3D Realms and their huge crash after 12 years of working on Duke Nukem Forever.  Just remember the initials of the game are DNF (Did not finish in racing terms).

Lastly there are two things that might be of interest for the reader.  First is that if you want to read about our lovely troubles with the GRID server we were using, Media Temple has a long log that can be found here.  Secondly, we are planning something big for the following week’s podcast that you will want to pay attention for.  We will announce something via Twitter, but it will have the possibility of listener participation.  Keep your eyes open for more news as the week progresses.

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast80_20090502.mp3</guid>



<description>We are back after a horrible week of technical difficulties, which included infusing the site with a ton of Xbox 360 news and PC news after the abboration that was the WiiCast two weeks ago.  But due to your patience, we managed to secure some time with Philip Kollar, former 1up.com writer and RebelFM host. Philip discusses his new job at Current.com and how they are infusing writing into a new gaming section of the site at www.current.com/gaming.

Our topic this week discussed achievements and why some people feel the need to cheat to get them.  While we started there, we also looked at the validation of achievements and trophies and how they tend to shape our gaming habits occasionally.

In the community section we are asked who the mysterious figure is that is Shane Whitehouse by jrittmayer and we pointed out the great reviews and other write ups that we had on the site for the past two weeks.  Finally in the news section we look at Street Fighter IV supporting GFW Live, a Mass Effect iPhone preview and Prince giving the thumbs down to Activision on inclusion to Guitar Hero.

Again we want everyone to visit the website at www.aeropause.com, send email to tips@aeropause.com and visit the forums.  Also make sure to review or rate us at iTunes using the show links.  Music is provided by Revolution Void at revolutionvoid.com and is mixed together my our master of mixology, Stephen Munn.

<title>Aeropodcast #79: BTW, the 360 Sucks</title>

<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2009/04/aeropodcast-79-btw-the-360-sucks/</link>

<guid>http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.aeropause.com/podcast/AeroPodcast79_20090419.mp3</guid>



<description>It’s just Koss and Fourhman for mighty mighty Aeropodcast #79!  With Haygood busy on his playdate, there’s nobody to defend the 360 from our crushingest criticism… so let the barbs fly (or whatever barbs do when unfettered.)

Inspired by Six Days in Fallujah, the topic at hand is what happens when wargames play up too much war… does it come at the expense of the game, or does it fall short of war entirely? Fallujah has been building steam as a realistic look at some very recent Iraq War events, but will it live up to that lofty goal?

In community news, we talk a little about the nigh-inevitable future of downloadable games, leading to Our Glorious Disk-Free World. In the news, we discuss Star Trek in Home, the sad case of GTA: Chinatown Wars, what firearms you may need to trade for a PSP, and the impending doom of Nintendo now that Japan has said nothanks.jpg to Deca Sports 2. Also, Animal Crossing comes up more times than you might expect.

And with a running time of 1:15, this is our first podcast in a while that you can actually finish in under a week’s worth of bus commutes!  Oh, and whenever you hear Fourhman mention “Resident Evil 4,” know that he’s really talking about “Resident Evil 5.” This is our secret code for you, our biggest fan.

<title>Aeropodcast #78: Can Someone Mow My Trunk</title>

<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2009/04/aeropodcast-78-can-someone-mow-my-trunk/</link>

<description>Koss, Fourhman and another one of those Munn guys, Paul join Joe on this week's podcast, where we spend a record amount of time discussing what we were playing.  As a matter of fact we were running so long, we ended up skipping the topic of discussion fro the week.  Mind you, that does not make this less of a podcast, because we have some great discussions including Lux-Pain and Godfather 2.  Hilarity ensues just with those two titles.  Also we get the scoop on a couple of MMO games from Paul.

In the community corner, we just had one question from our very own Jamel Snyder, who asked the writers what podcasts they enjoy listening too.  We also looked at several news items, including the rise of FileFront, a launch date for Prototype, and other items.  Also, we wanted everyone to make sure to join us on Sunday for the Aeropause Community Playdate from 8-11 PM EDT on April 19th.  We will be playing Gears of War 2 on Xbox 360.

Music is brought to you by Revolution Void, at www.revolutionvoid.com.  The podcast as always is put together by our expert mixmaster, Stephen.

<title>Aeropodcast #77: Hey, It's Jay Leno</title>

<link>http://www.aeropause.com/2009/04/aeropodcast-77-hey-its-jay-leno/</link>

<description>Koss and Fourhman join Joe this week to discuss ER and American Ninja.  Well, we started and ended on that note, but in between, we did discuss review score disparity, and how to compare arcade titles and full sized games when it comes to review scores.  This topic came to Fourhman when he saw the reviews for Bonzai Barber coming in at an 8 out of 10 over at IGN, and trying to quantify that.  Koss felt that the issue was review scores themselves being the issue, where Joe gave a personal slant to it, talking about reviewing games like those that come from Telltale and comparing the scores to mainstream titles he had reviewed.

In the community corner, we were asked a question by TheTony asking what new IP would we like to create and for bonus points, what platform would we release it on.  We had some surprises and of course something offensive to PETA, because deep down, we love those animal lovers.  In the news we look at the Lips mics being used for games other than Lips, the PowerGlove turning 20 and the PS2 selling for $99 among other items.  So sit back, take a seat and maybe watch Collision Course while looking for some sailors to get the full impact of this episode of the Aeropodcast.
