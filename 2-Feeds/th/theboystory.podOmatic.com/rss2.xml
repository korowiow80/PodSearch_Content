      <title>4: The Duke and the Raiders, Part 1</title>
      <description>In which the king sends The Boy to help The Duke defend his lands against raiders.  Mysterious red &amp; white striped eggs appear.  

This is the first podcast featuring an entirely new story.  The first three podcasts in The Boy's Adventures were first told in the fall of 2006 and have been retold three or four times since then.  

Many things have happened in the roughly 200 improvised non-recorded episodes of The Boy's Adventures.  Most relevant to this story, The Boy acquired a flaming sword, became a squire, and entered training to be a knight.  The items inside the eggs previously appeared in several story arcs.  You may find out more about them in the next few episodes.  We make up these stories as we go along, so maybe you won't!</description>

      <title>3: Smart</title>
      <description>In which The Boy helps the castle's engineers figure out how to build a tower on a slope--without guy wires.

This is the last introductory story.  Now that you know about the boy's strength, speed, and smarts, we can move into wilder stories.  This is also the last old story.  The next one will be improvised.</description>
