			<title>Double D Episode 78 - Stevie Likes Berries (Leinenkugels Berry Weiss)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-78-stevie-likes-berries-leinenkugels-berry-weiss]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We've made fun of the word "Leinenkugels" before, so now we give it it's fair due and drink some Leinenkugels Berry Weiss this episode. &nbsp;Daniel is a strong supporter of this fruity concoction, while Zen finds it just a little too sweet for his manly tastes.
During the opening segment we discuss our official fighting cock, Winston, and how he is being raised as opposed to the heinious conditions in which most other real fighting cocks are raised. &nbsp;We talk about Memorial Day and how each of us spent it. &nbsp;It's not National BBQ day, but that doesn't mean barbecues are off limits, dammit. &nbsp;Zen talks a little about the Pioneer Museum and horseshoes (again) and cattle brands.
All this leads us into our BoobTube segment for the week, this time with a video we found while searching YouTube with the terms, "Boobs" and "BBQ." &nbsp;This vid is a natural fit for the Double D, combining our two favorite subjects (Boobs and Beer, duh) into one incredible parody vid.



When we come back from the break, it is to tackle our titular news story. &nbsp;Steve is a man who went in to the doctors office to have some kidney stones looked at, and when the nurse performed an ultrasound on him she discovered that he had female sexual organs inside his body. &nbsp;This came as no surprise to Steve, who has had feeling all his life that he was really a woman. &nbsp;Steve now goes by Stevie and is living his life as a woman . . . sounds like Leinenkugels Berry Weiss is his new favorite drink! &nbsp;Salud! to people who don't have to live a lie anymore.



While we are respectful of Steve and his journey, this topic does lead to a short discussion of hermaphrodites and how we could use horrible pornographic images to make our own versions of motivational posters.
We close out the show with our Soccer Mom segment. &nbsp;While we watched five of these related videos, here's just one to give you a little taste. &nbsp;Man, we sure love it when our soccer moms crack the whip on their nerd husbands.

			<title>Double D Episode 77 - Chicken Skin (Shock Top Lemon Shandy)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-77-chicken-skin-shock-top-lemon-shandy]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[If you're easily offended, this episode is an all time low for us. &nbsp;But if you're listening, I doubt that you get offended easily, if at all. &nbsp;So maybe this is an all time high. &nbsp;Alex and Daniel tell some really good stories, tons of laughs are had, good beer is imbibed and we even educate a little. &nbsp;So crack open a Shock Top Lemon Shandy with us and enjoy!

In the first half of the show, we begin the education with the proper way to abbreviate state names. &nbsp;Then we introduce a couple new Urban Slang terms - #1 is Leinenkugels and #2 is Unleashing the Mummy's Curse. &nbsp;We admonish Alex to "just get TWO rags!" and the educate some more when we discuss why horses wear horseshoes.

After a short break we play some BoobTube, viewing a couple YouTube vids we found while searching the terms "Boobs" and "Vacuum"


Watch live video from doubledpodcast on Justin.tv

We reach another all time low when Alex describes the worst (or best?) thing he has ever masturbated with - chicken skin. &nbsp;Daniel then tells the story of why he was late to Ray's Birthday party. &nbsp;This story is now know as "Daniel's One Night Stand" or "The Case of the Missing Condom."
Finally, we issue another "Jacket To This" challenge. &nbsp;Before viewing the following video, please be forewarned that it does contain brief nudity, so is NOT to be viewed by minors. &nbsp;It is NOT pornographic, being an educational film, but still . . . enjoy!

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-76-i-was-helping-her-put-her-pants-on-boddingtons]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Full house for tonights show, including Zen and Ray, your intrepid hosts, but also Daniel and Richard Duran as well as newcomer Alex Dornhoefer. &nbsp;Or DoNoMore. &nbsp;Dunmeyer. &nbsp;I forget. &nbsp;But damn, he's a funny guy who knows how to really get close to the microphone. &nbsp;Anyway, we drink some Boddington's Pub Ale, with the little nitrogen aerator ball thingy that looks like a glow in the dark fishing bobber.
Anyway, in this show we begin by saying goodbye to a real man, Swamp People's Mitchell Guist. &nbsp;We debate why the show is so popular and what makes the Cajun Swamp lifestyle so appealing. &nbsp;We also play what may be the only leaked copy of the never before aired "Glenn and Mitchell Live from the Swamp Podcast."



After that we play our first BoobTube of the night, in honor of Mitchell's Squirrel story, "Boobs and Squirrel."



We then have another go at our new game, "Know Your Porn" this time with greater success. &nbsp;Ray battles Alex and we go several rounds with the letter "D." &nbsp;Alex then tells a couple raunchy sex stories, including the time he met a co-worker in the Sonic bathroom. &nbsp;When confronted by his boss upon exiting while buttoning up his pants, he calmly replied, "I was helping her put her pants on." &nbsp;Real Man.
Lastly, we read a news story about some retired gynecologist who claims to have found the actual G Spot by cutting up the recently deceased cadaver of an 83 year old Polish woman. &nbsp;This leads to our final BoobTube of the night, "Boobs and Polish"

            <description><![CDATA[This is a bit of a milestone show, as it is the first ever Double D Podcast without Ray. &nbsp;Daniel Duran sits in the co-host chair for this episode and does a damn fine job of it. &nbsp;We begin by talking about the first porn we ever encountered, which leads to Dan revealing some interesting facts concerning his older brother Lawrence and some homemade videos involving "White Bunny Girl" &nbsp;Richard walks into the studio at this point and adds to the conversation because he too has seen this video. &nbsp;We talk about buying "pogs" for little brothers and getting caught having sex at Summer Camp and at family reunions. &nbsp;Also Richie Pichie, Puddin' and Pie, F*cked the girl and made her cry.
In the second segment we play a new game for the show, "Know Your Porn." &nbsp;Cut us a little slack on this one, it's the first time we ever play it and it is a little shaky as we work out all the rules.
We conclude with BoobTube/Soccer Mom and also Mexican Word of the Day. &nbsp;Here's your vid:

			<title>Double D Episode 74 - Norwegia (Mother Road Brewery's Gold Road Kolsch Style Ale)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-74-norwegia]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Norwegia. &nbsp;A proud, Scandinavian (or is it Nordic?) country filled with . . . Norwayians? &nbsp;Whatever they may be called, chances are good they don't like us so much in Northern Arizona. &nbsp;But who cares, right? &nbsp;They all look like the Swedish Chef and drive the wrong way down one way streets and play Megadeth for packs of ravenous wolves.
If you aren't clued in yet to what we're talking about, take a look at this news article about John Larsgard, the man who went the wrong way down a road in Winslow, Arizona, took on half the town with his car and ended up in an Arizona prison for 7 1/2 years. &nbsp;We tell the mainstream press' side of the story, the Norwegian side of the story, and to get the Arizonan side of the story we went straight to the source and in this episode we interview one of the people directly involved. &nbsp;Wishing to keep her identity secret, we'll just call her "Mrs. X"
It's an interesting case and we hope you enjoy this show that strays a bit from our usual format. &nbsp;Don't worry, though, there's plenty of laughs and beer and poking fun at the great nation of Norwegia.
And, oh yeah, there was a BoobTube this episode, of course. &nbsp;Boobs and Norway. &nbsp;Check out some Butterface. &nbsp;Oh man, I expected more from Norway's version of Girls Gone Wild.




This one is a little better. &nbsp;Actually, a LOT better. &nbsp;Norwegian Chocolate Ad.

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-73-zambeti-warriors]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Double D Daniel Duran brought over some barely legal, inebriated youngsters and needless to say, it got chaotic in the studio for the first part of the show. &nbsp;Then they left and things settled down to a more usual pace. &nbsp;In that first, hectic half hour we discussed our beer of the week, the Phillipine's own San Miguel and how they pretty much own the islands and the basketball league there.
Then, after some rockabilly, we finally meet (in person, or should we say in poultry?) Winston the Fighting Cock.

Watch live video from doubledpodcast on Justin.tv

The kiddos leave and Zen gets down to some junior high tales of failed reports, physical abuse at the hands of diminutive Avon salesladies and Zambeti Warriors. &nbsp;We also had the usual segments of Soccer Mom (see Harrah's commercial below) and Boobtube (also below, Boobs and Jump Rope!)






Don't forget that we have the Summer Beer Belly Sports Tournament, The "Bocce Hibachi Festival" on Sunday July 1st. &nbsp;Kebabs, trophies, giveaways and the usual metric ton of cold beer await all who attend. &nbsp;Make sure you set the day aside for some good times.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Double D Daniel Duran brought over some barely legal, inebriated youngsters and needless to say, it got chaotic in the studio for the first part of the show. &nbsp;Then they left and things settled down to a more usual pace. &nbsp;In that first, hectic half hour we discussed our beer of the week, the Phillipine's own San Miguel and how they pretty much own the islands and the basketball league there.
Then, after some rockabilly, we finally meet (in person, or should we say in poultry?) Winston the Fighting Cock.

Watch live video from doubledpodcast on Justin.tv

The kiddos leave and Zen gets down to some junior high tales of failed reports, physical abuse at the hands of diminutive Avon salesladies and Zambeti Warriors. &nbsp;We also had the usual segments of Soccer Mom (see Harrah's commercial below) and Boobtube (also below, Boobs and Jump Rope!)






Don't forget that we have the Summer Beer Belly Sports Tournament, The "Bocce Hibachi Festival" on Sunday July 1st. &nbsp;Kebabs, trophies, giveaways and the usual metric ton of cold beer await all who attend. &nbsp;Make sure you set the day aside for some good times.

			<title>Double D Episode 71 - Sleep Study (Mission St. 2012 Anniversary Ale)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-71-sleep-study]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[A week late to be playing April Fools jokes, but we did it anyway, opening the show with some Nickelback and dubbing our rebooted podcast "The Nickelback Fan Show" &nbsp;Nobody fell for the joke, and we launched into the real deal. &nbsp;Our buddy Juan called in while we were cracking open our beers (O'douls (haha), Vampt, and Mission St. 2012 Anniversary Ale). &nbsp;After that Double D Daniel Duran showed up and Zen launched into the story that gives title to this show when he told all about his recent sleep study experience and how he should have taken that shower the morning after.

We watch a lot of videos after that, and we just wouldn't be good hosts if we didn't offer them up here for all of you that didn't catch the live show. &nbsp;First, we watched a little bit of Japanese Game Show goodness.



Then Zen added Soleil Moon Frye to the March Madness tournament with this creeptastic vid.



A little bit of Soccer Mom goes a long way



BoobTube this week was "Boobs" and "Armenian"



And finally we challenge our listeners to "Jacket To This"



Enjoy the show and don't forget we'll be live in Kingman on April 28th!

			<title>Video Highlights from Episode 70 - Cinco de Double Patrick's Day</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/video-highlights-from-episode-70-cinco-de-double-patrick-s-day]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[These videos have been posted on our Facebook page for a few days, but I just remembered that not everyone who listens to our show is a "Fan" on Facebook, so I'm posting them here also for everyone to enjoy. &nbsp;To be a more educated Booblet or Borracho, click "Like" over at Facebook.com/doubledpodcast

So there are four video clips to share with you today.
This first one shows just how bad the level of inebriation got during our Ping Pong tournament. &nbsp;While playing our doubles games, opposing players could sink beer pong balls into other players beer cups, forcing them to step away from the table and chug &nbsp;before they could resume playing, with no Time Out and the play continuing. &nbsp;Needless to say, a LOT of beer was consumed this way. &nbsp;

Watch live video from doubledpodcast on Justin.tv


Continuing a tradition of Live Music in the studio, The Rivals made their debut on Episode 70. &nbsp; Chuy D on acoustic guitar and vocals, Cousin Dave on bass and Drunk Cardo on percussion, which that night consisted of an empty beer box and a beer bottle.

Watch live video from doubledpodcast on Justin.tv


Cardo continued to stand out as a heavy contributor (pun intended) this show when he cobbled together this limerick about Maria Conchita Lupita Gonzalez.

Finally, it wouldn't be a Double D Podcast without Mexican Word of the Day, this time assisted by Daniel Duran, Cousin Dave and Cardo.

			<title>Double D Episode 70 - Cinco de Double Patricks Day (Guinness and Harp and Tecate)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-70-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[By the time the ping pong tournament was over and we all sat down to do this show, everyone was pretty plastered. &nbsp;And by pretty plastered, I mean Cardo blew a .33 BAC on the breathalyzer we had in the studio. &nbsp;So what ended up being over 2 hours of raw audio got trimmed down to a final cut of the podcast that runs about 1 hour and 12 minutes.
First and foremost, the Double D team of Ray and Zen, known in ping pong circles as "The Goon Squad", kept the trophy at home by going 6 and 1 in the triple elimination tournament. &nbsp;Congrats to all who entered and competed: &nbsp;The A Team, Chuy D and Cousin Dave - The Good Guys, Cardo and Carrie - Team Sparkles, Danielle and Nick and finally - Team Military Brats aka Team Go Postal, CC Rider and Crazy Legs Martha. &nbsp;It was a lot of fun and The Goon Squad will be defending the trophy next Spring.
Also joining us in the studio were a couple Double D's, the Duran Duran boys, Dick and Daniel. &nbsp;They probably would have dominated the ping pong table, but they showed up late. &nbsp;
In this episode we added some new contestants to our March Madness Tournament of Hotties, spewed forth some raunchy limericks, talked about some desperate men attempting to court MCLG, listened to Kingman band The Rivals plays some live music in the studio and looked at some pretty heinous pictures. &nbsp;(If you want to see them yourself, google "Special Fried Rice," "Blue Waffle," and "Lemon Party" &nbsp;Just don't say we didn't warn you.)
BoobTube for this ep was "Boobs and Shamrock" &nbsp; Enjoy!

			<title>Double D Episode 69 - The Clam Tostada (Rio Grande Chile Cerveza)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-69-the-clam-tostada]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Episode 69 originally was going to be the "Cinco de Double Patrick's Day" celebration, but due to Snowmageddon and the 30 some inches of snow that fell in just 36 hours, the party had to be postponed to Sunday March 25th. &nbsp;One guest did make it to the studio, however, and it saved this show. &nbsp;Even Biscuit Ray could not be in the studio physically, and instead we had to settle for "Invisible Ray" through the modern miracle of Skype.
Mark Anthony, of the Tucson band The Clam Tostada, was our lone guest for this episode, but he proved to be all we needed to have an excellent show. &nbsp;Besides being a longtime friend and a card carrying Herbal Medication Patient, he's also one hell of a musician. &nbsp;Here is his in studio performance of Clam Tostada's original song, "Love is a Marshmallow"

Watch live video from doubledpodcast on Justin.tv

Besides the music talk and performance, we also discuss this episode Rio Grande Chile Cerveza, 69 and the frenulum, The Rivals (Kingmans only non Mexican band) and our ongoing March Madness of Hotties. &nbsp;Stick around to the end and this episode's album art will make sense to you, as Mark explains how his beautiful wife wearing a fake mustache made her the object of adoration from both Lesbians and Straight Men alike.
Boobtube was also played this show. &nbsp;Enjoy this short clip found when we searched for "Boobs and St Patricks Day"

			<title>Double D Episode 122 - One Man One Grail (Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-122-one-man-one-grail]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Episode 122? &nbsp;How can this be? &nbsp;Just last week we did episode 68?! &nbsp;Well, we received, through a scientific breakthrough involving dial up internet and a DeLorean with a snowblower on the hood, this podcast from the future. &nbsp;The year 2014 to be exact. &nbsp;It seems Zen and Ray survive the apocalypse and will continue the Double D Podcast from their underground bunker. &nbsp;So we got that going for us. &nbsp;Nice to know that although the surface is uninhabitable and zombies roam the land, at least we still got culture.
After a Salud to Cousin Larry who is back in the homeland with us after a stint in Afghanistan, we get to our beer of the show, Monty Python's Holy Grail Ale. &nbsp;It's tasty and just a tad bit sweet, but smooth and easy to drink. &nbsp;Try it, it's tempered over burning witches.
We, meaning the us of the future, give the lowdown on how and why the apocalypse happened and what we, meaning the us of now, can do to stop it from happening. &nbsp;Also who wins major sporting events in 2012 and 2013 in case you want to make some sports bets. &nbsp;After a discussion of whether or not we would time travel if it were available, Ray admits he would go back in time to prevent a DUI, and Zen admits how would go back in time to try and save a little pride and self respect when he got dumped by ex-girlfriends.
A little March Madness business is conducted, with the Newscasters Division created, and we talk a little bit about the upcoming "Cinco de Double Patrick's Day" celebration.
Finally, we both watch the infamous "One Man, One Jar" video. &nbsp;Things will never be the same. &nbsp;Truly, there are some things that once seen, can never be unseen.

			<title>Double D Episode 68 - Adorable (Bud Light Platinum)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-68-adorable]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Take a look at the album art. &nbsp;Can you even tell that she's not really real, but instead a Real Doll? &nbsp;So the title of this episode isn't necessarily referring to the real doll face in the artwork for this episode (which by the way is the "Stephanie" face you can buy for your very own Real Doll) but instead the title is taken from a word we, for whatever reason, end up saying a lot during the broadcast. &nbsp;"Adorable."
We drink Bud Light Platinum and conclude it tastes very much like Bud Light. &nbsp;Which isn't an entirely bad thing. &nbsp;We give a Salud to Davy Jones, deceased Monkee, and listen to some 50's trumpet blues. &nbsp;Zen tells a story about gay guys with jumper cables and a new caller, Big Dawg, gives us a ring. &nbsp;Ray watches a Penile inflation video, 2 girls 1 cup style, and then Ray builds his very own Real Doll. &nbsp;Builds, but doesn't purchase, because he doesn't have 6 grand lying around. &nbsp;BoobTube is "Boobs and Platinum" and we introduce the first division in our annual March Madness of Hotties.
Don't forget that "Cinco de Double Patrick's Day" is on March 18th. &nbsp;Be there if you're anywhere in the vicinity. &nbsp;DoubleDPodcast@gmail.com for details.

We drink Bud Light Platinum and conclude it tastes very much like Bud Light. &nbsp;Which isn't an entirely bad thing. &nbsp;We give a Salud to Davy Jones, deceased Monkee, and listen to some 50's trumpet blues. &nbsp;Zen tells a story about gay guys with jumper cables and a new caller, Big Dawg, gives us a ring. &nbsp;Ray watches a Penile inflation video, 2 girls 1 cup style, and then Ray builds his very own Real Doll. &nbsp;Builds, but doesn't purchase, because he doesn't have 6 grand lying around. &nbsp;BoobTube is "Boobs and Platinum" and we introduce the first division in our annual March Madness of Hotties.
Don't forget that "Cinco de Double Patrick's Day" is on March 18th. &nbsp;Be there if you're anywhere in the vicinity. &nbsp;DoubleDPodcast@gmail.com for details.

			<title>Double D Episode 67 - Inflatable (Guinness)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-67-inflatable]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We drink Guinness Draughts (finally!) this episode, but before we ever get to downing some beers, we talk a LOT about inflatables . . . inflatable penises, inflatable shoes, inflatable love dolls . . . basically anything you can blow air into for fun. &nbsp;We also discuss in the first segment how awkward it is to buy porn at a convenience store and the desperate measures Zen would take to do so.
In the second segment we finally crack into our specially made Guinness cans and enjoy the fizzy foam that explodes from the widgets inside. &nbsp;It's Zen's first ever Guinness and the experience was entirely . . . underwhelming.
After some unimportant new stories concerning stolen Denny's burgers by Manager Impersonators and deciding whether or not to allow alcohol sales based on a coin flip, we get into BoobTube. &nbsp;This week it's "Boobs and Guinness" which led us to this video about breaking the world record for unhooking the most bras in one minute. &nbsp;Enjoy!

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-66-just-a-little-greek]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[What the hell does the title mean? &nbsp;I don't know, other than we kept saying "Just a little gay" during this episode and in a meager effort to class things up Zen brought up some basic Greek Philosophy. &nbsp;It'll all make sense when you listen to the episode.
While it was pretty will-nilly and bounced all over from subject to subject, some of the topics covered include: the best sports movies ever, the film sets of Tin Cup, where Moneyball failed, pigs appearing on the decals on Vermont Police cruisers, juggalos and heartless bitches.
For the BoobTube segment, Zen searched for "Boobs" and "Juggalos" and for some reason picked out the following video where the only boobs seen are these two short-bussers who try to opine on why bitches is heartless. &nbsp;This leads to the aforementioned discussion on Aristotle's A is A theory of identity. &nbsp;Also cynics and cynicism. &nbsp;Again, this will all make sense when you hear it.

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-63-the-mac-gyver-of-masturbation]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Joe Fellers joins us from sunny Kingman, Arizona and, like all his previous visits, this show runs a little long. &nbsp;So bonus: this show is about an extra hour of pure, delicious gravy.
So what's with the album art for episode 63? &nbsp;Why are there toilet paper dolls in the picture? &nbsp;You'll have to just listen to find out, but it is tied into the title of the show. &nbsp;A true MacGyver of Masturbation uses the resources he has at hand to get the job done. &nbsp;A roll of duct tape, some thumbtacks, maybe a broken cell phone . . . or in this case a toilet paper doll.
And that's not the limit of the penis talk that goes on this episode. &nbsp;Listen in to find out at what tender age your intrepid hosts first grew their pubes, and also hear sordid tales of junior high locker room embarrassment. &nbsp;All this as well as our usual BoobTube, Mexican Word of the Day and Soccer Mom segments in a hilarious 3 hour bonus edition of the Double D. &nbsp;Salud!
Some vids from the broadcast:

Wendi McLendon-Covey is our first nomination for Soccer Mom of the Year 2012. &nbsp;She appears briefly in this horrible video:



BoobTube this week is "Boobs and Zombies" &nbsp;Watch this odd Japanese trailer:



Ray is appearing as an extra in the independent film "Bloody Border" &nbsp;Check 'em out at BloodyBorder.com

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-61-bum-bum-bum-bum-bum]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We're drinking New Belgium's Snow Day beer this episode, and not just because it's a Winter Wonderland outside in Flagstaff, Arizona. &nbsp;This is a deliciously hoppy beer with a "keep you warm on a Winter's day" 6.2% alcohol content by volume.
We begin by talking about HBO's 24/7 series, this time focusing on the coming NHL Winter Classic starring the Philadelphia Flyers and some loser team from New York. &nbsp;We attempt to clean up the podcast in the spirit of the Holiday Season and fail miserably. &nbsp;The failure begins with our discussion of "pornaments," adult themed holiday decorations.
The Flagstaff Christmas Parade is mentioned next, as Zen lived out his dreams of being a Mascot. &nbsp;We also talk about "Real Man" Christmas trees, with orange extension cords and generators in tow.
Zen shares his childhood Christmas wish of getting a Star Wars AT-AT, much like Ralphie's wish to get a Red Ryder BB gun in "A Christmas Story." &nbsp;Ray can't remember ever wanting much of anything around Christmastime.
The Legend of Sancho Claus, sung by Chuy D last year, is replayed for your pleasure, and then Zen tells the story of the feud he's having with a local homeless man. &nbsp;He unveils his new song, "Bum bum bum bum bum," sung to the tune of "The Little Drummer Boy."
Enjoy this holiday themed episode, and please share!

			<title>Double D Episode 60 - Forever Lazy (Coors)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-60-forever-lazy]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Infomercials that confound and confuse and yet make us want their products so badly are the focus of this show. &nbsp;I guess it makes sense being this close to Christmas that the spirit of Wanting is upon us.
We're drinking the banquet beer, Coors, this show. &nbsp;Although we try to talk it up, what is there to say about Coors? &nbsp;It's been around forever and is a trusted American brand. &nbsp;We start the show watching this vid which was shared with us by Robert Mesa. &nbsp;Do as he advised us, which is stick around to the end. &nbsp;It starts out a little hippieish but ends with what can only be described as a series of unbelievable moves.



We play a new game next, called Hollywood or Porno. &nbsp;Biscuit Ray must decide if an audio clip is from the Hollywood version or the Porno version of Ironman. &nbsp;We discuss why porn shoots don't shell out the bucks for better effects or production value, and then compare a porn producer's budget to the budget that must have existed to put out this awesome youtube clip:



Next we tackle various informecials, commercials and such.









We close out the show with Boobtube. &nbsp;Enjoy!

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Infomercials that confound and confuse and yet make us want their products so badly are the focus of this show. &nbsp;I guess it makes sense being this close to Christmas that the spirit of Wanting is upon us.
We're drinking the banquet beer, Coors, this show. &nbsp;Although we try to talk it up, what is there to say about Coors? &nbsp;It's been around forever and is a trusted American brand. &nbsp;We start the show watching this vid which was shared with us by Robert Mesa. &nbsp;Do as he advised us, which is stick around to the end. &nbsp;It starts out a little hippieish but ends with what can only be described as a series of unbelievable moves.



We play a new game next, called Hollywood or Porno. &nbsp;Biscuit Ray must decide if an audio clip is from the Hollywood version or the Porno version of Ironman. &nbsp;We discuss why porn shoots don't shell out the bucks for better effects or production value, and then compare a porn producer's budget to the budget that must have existed to put out this awesome youtube clip:



Next we tackle various informecials, commercials and such.









We close out the show with Boobtube. &nbsp;Enjoy!

			<title>Double D Episode 59 - Sweep the Leg</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-59-sweep-the-leg]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Christmas is almost upon us, but before you plunge into your gifts with unabridled avarice, please take a moment to reflect on the carnage that was Black Friday 2011. &nbsp;We talk about an unfortunate incident here in Arizona where police bloody and bruise and then handcuff a poor old grandpa who was only trying to protect his grandson during a Black Friday Free for All. &nbsp;The video proof is below. &nbsp;Police say that they used standard police procedure, which included "sweeping the leg." &nbsp;Looks like someone trained at Cobra Kai Dojo.
The album art for this episode if you look at your iPod or media player is the sensai from Cobra Kai. &nbsp;But if you look to the right here, you'll see that our blog post picture is a lovely soccer mom. &nbsp;Yup, here is the picture we promised of this episode's Soccer Mom, in all her pharmaceutical glory. &nbsp;Gaze upon her.
Sorry this ep was so late in getting out. &nbsp;We at the Double D work for the Coastal Nervous as you know, and this is our busiest time of year. &nbsp;Please accept our apologies and enjoy this show!

			<title>Double D Episode 58 - The Pull Back (Wasatch Brewing's Devestator Double Bock)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-58-the-pull-back]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The Beer this episode: Wasatch Brewing's Devestator, a double bock that clocks in at a brain-slugging 8.0 percent alcohol by volume. &nbsp;While we chug that down we talk about porn (what else is new) and how certain camera angles can ruin the experience. &nbsp;We also discuss some of the most awkward and silly and downright dangerous sexual positions you can attempt, complete with drawings to illustrate how bad they are.
There was also BoobTube, this time searching for vids with Boobs and Nerf Guns, and the other usual segments, including Salud and Mexican Word of the Day. &nbsp;Oh yeah, we also have a news story about a "doctor" performing surgeries without a license, and by performing surgeries, we mean injecting cement, fix-a-flat and super glue into patients asses. &nbsp;Yeah.
Enjoy, spread around to your friends, and most of all make sure you are subscribed to the show on iTunes. &nbsp;Thanks!
Here's a couple vids from the live broadcast, so that you don't miss any of the visuals that make our show complete.

			<title>Double D The Lost Episode - Thanks For Having Me</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-the-lost-episode-thanks-for-having-me]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[I've been sitting on this one for too long, and it's time to release it out into the world. &nbsp;And not just because we didn't record a new show this past weekend and I have nothing else to release (although that did play a major part in the decision.) &nbsp;This show is just too damn funny to keep to myself any longer. &nbsp;It must be shared.
The reason it's been under wraps for so long is that the audio is shit. &nbsp;I tried and tried to clean it up, but there's no getting around the fact that the audio is garbage. &nbsp;For some reason, Varouj's microphone was never turned on and we never noticed and, even worse, there was an echo of a 2 second delay throughout the entire recording. &nbsp;What we present now is the best it's ever going to be, short of scripting and re-recording the entire thing. &nbsp;It's worth it, though, believe me.
Varouj and Dustin are naturally funny guys, and their talents shine through the bad audio. &nbsp;From tales of ethnic woe in Armenia to Varouj's top ten porn stars of all time, this is one you gotta listen to, at the very least to round out your Double D Podcast collection.
So here it is, the one and only "Lost Episode" of the Double D Podcast. &nbsp;It's lost no longer. &nbsp;Welcome home. &nbsp;And Thanks for having me.

			<title>Double D Episode 57 - Doubleween</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-57-doubleween]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We're rushing this one out, A. Because we wanted it out for everyone to enjoy on Halloween and B. Because this is one helluva funny episode start to finish and didn't need any editing.
So this is our Halloween, er, excuse me, Doubleween episode, but before we got to talk about anything Halloweeny like costumes and candy and shit, we got fascinated with the idea of a guy have two dicks, or "Double Ween." &nbsp;See how we got on the subject? &nbsp;We go on for about 15 minutes or so before we settle down and talk about Halloween proper. &nbsp;We begin with Bloody Mary and how the practice of it unsettled Zen's childhood.



Next we talk about Halloween, mainly Ben Cooper costumes and how unfrickingcomfortable they were. &nbsp;Zen proposes a couple ideas on how he could put his new round shape to good use in a costume this year. &nbsp;We look at some creepy Victorian era pictures and then roll into our second break.



In the final segment we check out BoobTube, which this week is a video based on a YouTube search for "boobs" and "poker"



Zen shares some new Hot Women of Commercials vids



And we wrap up the show with Mexican Word of the Day. &nbsp;This week - "Distress" and "Habanero"

			<title>Double D Episode 56 - Mas Racism</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-56-mas-racism]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[A little sociological experiment here. &nbsp;We examine scientifically a handful of YouTube videos and talk about what makes them racist (or not.) &nbsp;For those uncomfortable with racism, or simply are too P.C. and uptight to laugh at a little unintentional racism now and then, proceed instead to our next episode which is a good one and has lots of double weiner jokes.
We begin with some catching up and tackle a new tongue twister, courtesy of a Flyers hockey game: &nbsp;"A stick stuck in Steckel's skate" &nbsp;Try and say it 3 times fast. &nbsp;We learn the Filipino word for vagina and how it ties in both to a gay latin pop star and also our housecat "Super Pooswah"
Then we talk about Boob Missiles and this leads into a discussion of Racism and the Japanese. &nbsp;From creepy Ronald McDonald commercials to badly dubbed black guys, the Japanese take more than their fair share of criticism. &nbsp;Then, after another break, we turn our YouTube eyes on to those of African Descent. &nbsp;From awkward commercials to awkward game show moments, we have a little light hearted fun.
Finally, we focus on The Mexicans. &nbsp;We learn some new "Mexican Words of the Day" and also view some "Mexican Pictures of the Day." &nbsp;We consume some delicious Mexican Candy and wrap this one up.

			<title>Double D Episode 55 - Dubtoberfest (Warsteiner, Ayinger and Craig's Homebrewed Pumpkin Ale)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-55-dubtoberfest]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The title of this one pretty much says it all. &nbsp;Recorded immediately after Dubtoberfest, a day filled with brats, Sonoran Dogs, Badminton, Polka music mixed with a little reggae and most of all Beer, Beer, Beer. &nbsp;It was good times with good friends.
I'm not going to do like I usually do and spoil all the content by listing it here. &nbsp;Just know that we covered most of the usual bases, with Saluds, Dulas, BoobTube, Really Unimportant News and Mexican Word of the Day. &nbsp;There were quite a few folks in the Studio with us and pretty much everyone got a little mic time and the conversation went where it wanted to. &nbsp;And by that I mean boobs, hot commercial women, what kids call their junk and pissing in the shower.
A Big Salud goes out to Big Don Juan, Cousin Dave, Chuy D and the Double D Herself Danielle Diaz for joining in and creating chaos out of order. &nbsp;It's all in all a great show and one we're sure you'll enjoy.
P.S. &nbsp;Look at those two doofuses in the Album Art for this episode. &nbsp;I guess a Congratulations would be in order for "The A Team" of Cousin Dave and Chuy D who are the first team to ever take home the Double D Badminton Trophy. &nbsp;They went undefeated while the hosts of the tournament, Biscuit Ray and Pudboy Zen, went winless. &nbsp;Big Don and his partner came in second while the team of CC Rider and Double D Herself came in a respectable third. &nbsp;Next year the trophy comes home . . .&nbsp;

            <description><![CDATA[Hey, all. &nbsp;This one's going out early because we talk about plans for Dubtoberfest and as of this being released, the party is just a couple days away. &nbsp;This one is short and sweet, plenty of funny to go around and it won't take you long to listen to it all.
Zen goes to Las Vegas and finds his soul. &nbsp;He also spots a hooker "on the job." &nbsp;The Double D Bowling Team is doing well, and we bring you a little info on who they are and what shenanigans they are up to while attempting to be keglers. &nbsp;There is only one news story this episode, and it's about a woman who won the Powerball "on accident." &nbsp;We briefly touch on our own Lottery Dreams and you gotta promise not to tell PETA what they are. &nbsp;BoobTube this week was a video based on the YouTube search for "Boobs" and "Bowling."

			<title>Double D Episode 53 - Apples for the Repo Man (Ska Brewing's ESB Special)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-53-apples-for-the-repo-man]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[That's right, the Dbacks had just clinched the NL West before we recorded this show, so we kicked things off with a little celebratory video:



We were drinking Ska Brewing's ESB Special this episode. &nbsp;Don't ask us what the ESB stands for. &nbsp;Zen starts the show with a little true life story of the "Korean End Run" and how Flagstaff P.D. actually made him proud. &nbsp;Justice was served. &nbsp;We share the news that McDonald's will soon be putting both french fries AND apple slices in every Happy Meal soon. &nbsp;Are apples for queers? &nbsp;What?!



Before we continue the second segment, we take a break, wrongly, to tell and listen to some racist jokes. &nbsp;Thanks, Cousin Joe, for you assistance in this heinous matter. &nbsp;Zen shares his love for Spike TV's newest reality show, Repo Games.



In this week's BoobTube segment, we search YouTube for videos with the keywords "Boobs" and "Pushups" to score some (ahem) tasty treats.







Mexican Word of the Day begins our third and final segment. &nbsp;Summarize. &nbsp;Terrace. &nbsp;Accommodate.
We discuss a few plans for Dubtoberfest, which is rapidly approaching. &nbsp;Make plans to join us Sunday October 9th at 2 pm for beer, brats, polka, reggae and badminton. &nbsp;If you need details and directions, email doubledpodcast@gmail.com or contact us on Facebook.

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-52-fisticuffs-in-space]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We drink Caguama Cerveza this show, and beyond knowing that the name means some sort of special Loggerhead Turtle, all we can say is that it's a decent enough Mexican Beer. &nbsp;At least there was a LOT of it. &nbsp;Chuy D calls in to confess to stealing beers from his Pops, and this leads to a discussion of us drinking beers as toddlers. &nbsp;Zen mentions the bottle caps from all the beers we've been drinking have been made into pins, which can be purchased by sending 5 bucks to
Double D Podcast 
P.O. Box 1509&nbsp;
Flagstaff, AZ 86002&nbsp;
If you want to know what caps we have available, email us ahead of time: doubledpodcast@gmail.com
We talk about Star Wars being released on Blu-Ray, and the 3 things George Lucas SHOULD have changed in the new versions.
Watch live video from doubledpodcast on Justin.tv
Finally, before the first break, we do the BOOBTUBE segment. &nbsp;Terms searched this week are, appropriately enough, "Boobs" and "Star Wars."



First Break Song, as picked by Biscuit Ray


We talk next about having sex with cartoon characters and also having Sex in a Graveyard. &nbsp;Yeah. &nbsp;In Really Unimportant News we report that Trinity College's website was hacked, with a fake profile for a Professor "Conan T. Barbarian" making it's way onto the faculty list. &nbsp;Also, a creepy statue of a life sized Hot Dog-Man was stolen and subsequently dumped because it was too creepy looking to keep.

Second Break Song, courtesy of Biscuit Ray


We close out the show with Mexican Words of the Day. &nbsp;Paralyze, Harley and Nissan.
We disclose some more Dubtoberfest plans and then close with a little Cafe Tacuba - Volver a Comenzar.

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-51-fire-flips-and-chicanos]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Kona Brewing makes an excellent passion fruit infused beer, and this leads to a discussion on why it's called "passion fruit." &nbsp;Ray spins yarns about his Kingman "mixer" and Zen recounts his adventures at the Coconino County Fair. &nbsp;There are some short and sweet reviews of recent DVD releases, including "Your Highness" "Paul" and "Super." &nbsp;Zen lays down plans for a movie starring Biscuit Ray as a mild-mannered postman by day, Mexican Wizard by night, entitled "F*cking Rad". &nbsp;We also discuss plans for an Oktoberfest style party to be held October 9th, called "Dubtoberfest." &nbsp;This is a real thing. &nbsp;Be there on October 9th for Pumpkin Beer and Brats.
First Break Song, courtesy of Pomplamoose:


Zen gives a Top 5 List about Cousin Dave and Beyonce's future child. &nbsp;We wonder why Toilet Paper is "good enough" and we continue the celebrity news with a story about Jim Carrey tagging his own home with the cryptic acronym "FFC"
Second Break Songs, courtesy of Garfunkel and Oates:



We open the third segment with our favorite new bit, Boobtube. &nbsp;This week we searched for videos with "Boobs" and "Shoeshine" and got this little gem:


We try and decide what the "awkward creep factor" is when viewing porn with other dudes and Zen remembers the time he filmed the worst quality, lowest resolution porn ever committed to tape. &nbsp;Mexican Words of The Day - Extinct, Ascot and Venture. &nbsp;Mexican Candy and the show closes with The Whigs "Right Hand on My Heart"

			<title>Double D Episode 50 - Mexican Moonshine (Roger Clyne's Mexican Moonshine Tequila)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-50-mexican-moonshine]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Thanks for listening to our 50th show! &nbsp;It took us a little longer to reach 50 than most other podcasts, mainly because Ray seems to always be on vacation, but we made it. &nbsp;To celebrate, we pay homage to our opening audio clip (borrowed from the wonderful Tres Amigos) and say, "We don't have no beers, jus' tequila" &nbsp;We fork over a few extra bucks and tip the bottle with Roger Clyne's Mexican Moonshine. &nbsp;Based on his song of the same name, Roger's Mexican Moonshine is a 100% puro de agave Reposado that we find super-smooth, incredibly easy to drink and by the end of the night an accomplished happiness-bearer.
Zen opens the show with a tale of a little monster, aka "Anchor Baby" and then goes on to infuritate Ray with news of Miley Cyrus being inducted into the Celebrity Bowling Hall of Fame. &nbsp;We talk way too much about cock rings, hair ties and shoelaces and then take the show to an all-time low with videos of a hen laying an egg and a rooster owned by Mensa members violating a stuffed cat.


For our newly christened "BoobTube" segment, a weekly bit where we search on YouTube for videos based solely on two words (one of which will always be Boob), we search this week for "Snow Boobs" vids and come up with the following doozies:


Next we cover the Really Unimportant News for the week in our R.U.N. segment, including stories of Rogue Pandas in Flagstaff. &nbsp;We cover the usual Mexican Word of the Day and chomp on some Mexican Candy . . . two delectable treats that looked like "Tampon Squeezins" and "Turd Logs"

Thanks so much for sticking with us through our first 50 episodes, and we hope you'll crack open a beer with us each week for the next 50.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-49-biscuit-and-pudboy-present-chicken-train]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We might be changing the name of the show from Double D to "Biscuit and Pudboy" we'll just have to wait and see. &nbsp;Big thanks to the Hammer for calling in multiple times to track the progress of her inebriation and to Mrs. Strong for keeping our ignorance in check in the chatroom.
We drank Nectar Ale's Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale during this show. &nbsp;It was a nice brown ale with a creamy head (uy) and got a thumbs up from all in the studio. &nbsp;
Saluds for this episode went out to Chuy D and The Electric Army, who played their last show at The Orpheum last Saturday night. &nbsp;Also a quick shout to Zen for celebrating his 38th birthday last week. &nbsp;"Dulas", or reverse Salud, went out to Roberto Salamanca for drunkenly, without license or insurance, killing a 20 year old driver when he rammed him head on. &nbsp;Boo-yah, you piece of shit.
Our YouTube search this week involved the following two words: &nbsp;"boobs" and "pogo stick" . . . I guess technically thats 3 words, but whatever. &nbsp;Here's the video we came up with:

News included stories of Explosions In The Sky, Tiny Eggs (with a quick lecture by Prof. Van DerLiquor on chicken wings), Lemonistas and Old Men in Speedos.
The Show closed out with Mexican Word of The Day, Mexican Candy and The Electric Army playing their Original Song, "Better Things"
Salud!

			<title>Double D Episode 47 - OT Jacket To This (Samuel Adams Coastal Wheat)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-47-ot-jacket-to-this]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Hoppa Grass - When Brothers smoke grasshoppers in lieu of weed. &nbsp;Now that that is defined, let's get on with the show notes . . .
First off, Zen was finally promoted from PTF to Regular at the old Coastal Nervous, so in honor of that we drank some delicious Sam Adams Coastal Wheat (with just a hint of lemon!) &nbsp;This led into some wonderful Coastal Nervous stories, inspired by our favorite podcast, A Mediocre Time with Tom and Dan. &nbsp;What is a Coastman to do when he spots a customer masturbating? &nbsp;What is a Coastman to do when he eats at Freddy's and gets a belly stinger an hour later? &nbsp;Speaking of Belly Stingers, Zen shares the honest truth about his Shy Sphincter and how public toilets just aren't his cup of tea. &nbsp;Finally, what is a Coastman to do when he sees a City Worker angrily throw his radio through his truck, out the open window and into another car at the gas station?
First Break Song:
See-I "Homegrown 2011" (mp3)  from "See-I" (Fort Knox Recordings) Buy at iTunes Music Store More On This Album
The Second Segment kicks off with The News. &nbsp;Ray reads news stories about Blue Sharks found far from the ocean, Wal-Mart telling Telly Savalas to cover us his bikini and Drunken Cooking gone wrong. &nbsp;Today's Drunken Cooking Recipe:
Zen's Corn Beef Hash and Rice
Ease of Preparation: 9
Taste: 1 - 7.5 depending on whether or not you like Canned Corn Beef
Danger Rating: 5
Open can of corn beef. &nbsp;Skillet fry until slightly crispy. &nbsp;Make pot of rice. &nbsp;Mix corn beef into rice. &nbsp;Refrigerate in covered container. &nbsp;After arriving home from bar, reheat in microwave for 2 minutes. &nbsp;Eat and enjoy.
The Pixies "Here Comes Your Man" is the second break song.
The final segment begins with Mexican Word of the Day. &nbsp;Todays words:
- Fascinate
- Postal
- Cologne and Odor
Mexican Candy is a homemade lollipop with recycled wrappers that looked a lot like the mosquito-laden amber from Jurassic Park. &nbsp;Despite our hesitancy about consuming an obviously homemade treat, it was quite delicious.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Hoppa Grass - When Brothers smoke grasshoppers in lieu of weed. &nbsp;Now that that is defined, let's get on with the show notes . . .
First off, Zen was finally promoted from PTF to Regular at the old Coastal Nervous, so in honor of that we drank some delicious Sam Adams Coastal Wheat (with just a hint of lemon!) &nbsp;This led into some wonderful Coastal Nervous stories, inspired by our favorite podcast, A Mediocre Time with Tom and Dan. &nbsp;What is a Coastman to do when he spots a customer masturbating? &nbsp;What is a Coastman to do when he eats at Freddy's and gets a belly stinger an hour later? &nbsp;Speaking of Belly Stingers, Zen shares the honest truth about his Shy Sphincter and how public toilets just aren't his cup of tea. &nbsp;Finally, what is a Coastman to do when he sees a City Worker angrily throw his radio through his truck, out the open window and into another car at the gas station?
First Break Song:
See-I "Homegrown 2011" (mp3)  from "See-I" (Fort Knox Recordings) Buy at iTunes Music Store More On This Album
The Second Segment kicks off with The News. &nbsp;Ray reads news stories about Blue Sharks found far from the ocean, Wal-Mart telling Telly Savalas to cover us his bikini and Drunken Cooking gone wrong. &nbsp;Today's Drunken Cooking Recipe:
Zen's Corn Beef Hash and Rice
Ease of Preparation: 9
Taste: 1 - 7.5 depending on whether or not you like Canned Corn Beef
Danger Rating: 5
Open can of corn beef. &nbsp;Skillet fry until slightly crispy. &nbsp;Make pot of rice. &nbsp;Mix corn beef into rice. &nbsp;Refrigerate in covered container. &nbsp;After arriving home from bar, reheat in microwave for 2 minutes. &nbsp;Eat and enjoy.
The Pixies "Here Comes Your Man" is the second break song.
The final segment begins with Mexican Word of the Day. &nbsp;Todays words:
- Fascinate
- Postal
- Cologne and Odor
Mexican Candy is a homemade lollipop with recycled wrappers that looked a lot like the mosquito-laden amber from Jurassic Park. &nbsp;Despite our hesitancy about consuming an obviously homemade treat, it was quite delicious.
Finally, we introduce the listener challenge, "Jacket to This" in which we ask our listeners to email or post the most bizarre pictures that would be IMPOSSIBLE to Jacket To.
Final Song - The Breeders with "Bang On"]]></itunes:subtitle>

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-46-feats-of-daring]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The show starts with a brief recap of what went down the week we took off from the show and then very quickly launches into a discussion of Harry Potter Fans and why there are no "special needs" children in the Harry Potter Universe.
Zen hands out some presents from Tucson and Tombstone and then the guys act out what a Zombie Film with Mexicans in it would be like.
Flogging Molly plays the first break song, "The Likes of You Again"
After the break we relaunch the "Mexican Word of the Day" segment with 5 wonderful examples:

Harassment
Passionate
Testimony
Jewish and Kosher

Current news brings us a comparison of Oprah on the cover of Globe Magazine to a character from The Dark Crystal (see album art) . . . we cross our fingers that Casey Anthony accepts Larry Flynt's offer to pose in Hustler magazine and we read a couple news stories of pedophiles in Tucson, which leads us to a little Bad Acting Theater when we try to reenact a scene from Dateline's To Catch a Predator.
Biz Markie plays the second break song, "Throw Back"
Current News continues with the story of the 3 legged tortoise and the article about thousands of illegal immigrants fleeing California to go back to Mexico, where, apparently, jobs are more plentiful. &nbsp;We propose that Mexicans and Asians are interchangable, especially in restaurants.
We do our Mexican Candy segment by consuming some Asian candy . . . Haw Flakes, little semi-sweet discs that look a lot like mini pepperonis.
The show concludes with "Feats of Daring" in which we don crazy googly-eyed glasses and attempt to hammer a nail into a piece of wood. &nbsp;This feat will have to be repeated by every future guest of the show.
The outro song is Whiskey Rodeo's "Whole Lotta You"]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-44-the-mystery-box]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Hidden in this 4th of July episode is our funniest bit ever. &nbsp;I'll let you know when we get to it, but first we kick off the show, as always, with what we're drinking and this time it's Ska Brewing's Mexican Logger. &nbsp;We talk about why some might be offended by the can's original logo and also how tasty and refreshing this Mexican style lager is on a humid day.
We light off some sparklers and play R. Kelly's badly remixed National Anthem to say Happy Birthday to America. &nbsp;We question the wisdom of making legal the sale of fireworks but not their use. &nbsp;Chuy D calls in briefly and then we do something we haven't done in a few episodes: &nbsp;play a game. &nbsp;Ray is quizzed on the similairities between the names of fireworks and the names of sex toys.
After the first break song, The Refreshments' "Buy American" we get a pair of phone calls. &nbsp;First MCLG calls in with a Knock Knock joke and then Jonathan calls with an actual phone call from the Bay Area. &nbsp;We talk beer, weather and chicks with Theremins.
Here it is. &nbsp;After Jonathan hangs up we launch into the first ever "Ray's Segment" and the inaugural one is a doozy. &nbsp;Ray steps up to the whiteboard and explains, with diagrams, how the human female reproductive system is laid out and how it functions. &nbsp;If you haven't caught the video, just scroll down. &nbsp;From now on, if Ray doesn't have a bit ready he'll have to step up to the 2 dimensional White Board (DDWB) and scientifically explain something. &nbsp;If you have ideas for Ray's Segment, email them to DoubleDPodcast@gmail.com or call them in to 4242 DRUNKS (424-237-8657).
The second break song is The Refreshments' "Mexico"
In our last segment we do something we NEVER do - get serious. &nbsp;We don't like to do this, as it's just not our style, but it was such an important news story to our hometown of Flagstaff that it HAD to be mentioned at least briefly.

The Refreshments close out the show with "Suckerpunch"]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 43 - Yerrow Rung (Breckenridge Summer Bright Ale)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-43-yerrow-rung]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We enjoy delicious Breckenridge Summer Bright Ale during this episode. &nbsp;It's cool and refreshing and it definitely helped us get through another sweltering, swamplike recording session in the Double D Studio.
We begin by briefly discussing the Riordan Gig, an annual fundraiser for the Riordan Mansion here in Flagstaff that this year was good enough to have Distraction and the Electric Army perform there, two music groups that are friends of the show. &nbsp;Also at the Riordan Gig: &nbsp;massive Ricola Horns. &nbsp;I'm sure there is a real, proper name for them, we just don't know what that is. &nbsp;We do know how long they are, however.
We introduce a new segment that will help open every show from now on - Salud! &nbsp;Feel free to email, call or post on our Facebook page anyone or anything you would like us to raise a glass to. &nbsp;This week we say "Salud!" to Cardo for his 45th birthday and to friend of the show Jay on his (possible?) marriage.
The subject of Flagstaff being coated in yellow dust comes up next. &nbsp;It's tree pollen (pine cum) and it's everywhere. &nbsp;Yerrow Rung.
Music from Roger Clyne and the Peacemaker's new album "Unida Cantina" is played during this epidsode. &nbsp;The first break song is "Heaven On a Paper Plate"
Chuy graces the wall of the studio with a terrific penis doodle he scribbled during the break. &nbsp;This leads to the topic of circumcision and whether or not that is private information. &nbsp;Zen shares another dream, this time of a point-of-view blowjob gone horribly wrong. &nbsp;Three celebrity women are discussed next: &nbsp;Rosie Huntington Whiteley, Shania Twain and Amanda Bynes. &nbsp;Another Salud! is raised, this time for dead celebrity Ryan Dunn. &nbsp;We play the easiest Movie Title Trivia Game ever, titled "What's the name of that movie, the one with . . ." and we discuss "3D Sex and Zen" and how this fits into the timeline of the evolution of Porn.



Second break song - "Dinero"
MCLG calls in to sing a little "FU" to her amorous adversary, "Cherrie" &nbsp;We talk about what happened recently in Flag-town, namely the "Pride in the Pines" event. &nbsp;This becomes a smallish trivia game involving the names of Gay Bars in movies and we wrap up the show with a listing of cool Drag Queen Names.
Final Song - "Empty Highway"

			<title>Double D Episode 42 - Chupacabron (Margaritaville Landshark)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-42-chupacabron]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode is about cryptozoology. &nbsp;Nessie. &nbsp;Bigfoot. &nbsp;The Montauk Monster. &nbsp;Chupacabra. &nbsp;We don't believe in any of them, but we still love looking at the pictures and watching the videos "proving" their existence on youtube. &nbsp;So we crack open some LandShark beers by Margaritaville and a couple 4Lokos to get good and sauced while we sift through the bullshit, the hoaxes and the rare unexplainable images and vids that are all over the internet.
What got me going on this subject was this article printed in 1890 by the Tombstone Epitaph, recounting the tale of two ranchers who brought down a mysterious winged beast by the Huachuca mountain range. &nbsp;Their tale would suggest that they had encountered a Pteranadon or pterasaur of some type, in an age where little if any knowledge of such dinosaurs existed. &nbsp;This article really grabbed my imagination and got me thinking about the paranormal creatures that fascinated me as a youngster. &nbsp;I googled some of the biggies and found this recent video clip purporting to have captured the latest sighting of Bigfoot.


You should know that before we ever got to the topic of cryptozoology, the entire first segment is centered around Castoreum, a raspberry flavoring enhancer Ray clued me in on as originating from a beaver's anal glands. &nbsp;Who the hell discovers these things? &nbsp;Who is the first guy that sucked on a beaver's ass and thought, "Man, this would really enhance the flavor of artificial raspberry"? &nbsp;
We haven't done an episode like this in a while, focused in on one topic alone, and it seems like an old Zen and Peace Show. &nbsp;We'll be back in episode 43 with the regular format, where we promise to drift all over the place from topic to topic, randomly, wherever the beer leads us. &nbsp;Salud!

You should know that before we ever got to the topic of cryptozoology, the entire first segment is centered around Castoreum, a raspberry flavoring enhancer Ray clued me in on as originating from a beaver's anal glands. &nbsp;Who the hell discovers these things? &nbsp;Who is the first guy that sucked on a beaver's ass and thought, "Man, this would really enhance the flavor of artificial raspberry"? &nbsp;
We haven't done an episode like this in a while, focused in on one topic alone, and it seems like an old Zen and Peace Show. &nbsp;We'll be back in episode 43 with the regular format, where we promise to drift all over the place from topic to topic, randomly, wherever the beer leads us. &nbsp;Salud!

			<title>Double D Episode 39 - Joey Cherub and Fancy Elf Boots (Yuengling)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-39-joey-cherub-and-fancy-elf-boots]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Still a little hungover from Episode 38 Live from Joe's Garage, we gingerly step back into the ring with this smallish episode. &nbsp;We start off by cracking open some Yuengling beer, fresh from Pennsylvania courtesy of Joe's Pop, who didn't know we stole it on our way out of Kingman.
We do a little recap of what went down two weeks ago at Joe's Dirty Thirty Birthday party. &nbsp;Zen vaguely recalls downing (among other libations) a particularly nasty can of Steel Reserve and how that led to a little chunk-puking. &nbsp;We talk about ping pong pinata baseball and a cockfighting DVD that almost killed the party before it even began. &nbsp;Check out the commemorative T Shirt by clicking here. &nbsp;Lastly, we celebrate Chuy D's drunken version of Hallelujah. &nbsp;Check out the video Cousin Dave filmed below.


After the Meat Puppets play us through our first break, Maria calls in (as usual) but this time in a somewhat surly mood. &nbsp;She suspects Ray has been less than faithful and so serenades him with a little "End of the Road." &nbsp;After that Joe joins the live broadcast and thru the chat room exclaims rather surprisedly that he spots a couple of his Yuenglings on our desk. &nbsp;Oops. &nbsp;Sorry about that. &nbsp;We then talk about the nervousness one might feel visiting a new house for the first time and wondering what strange smells we might encounter. &nbsp;Joe must have danced through his home in a toga spreading rose petals because his home smelled fabulous with a capital F. &nbsp;This leads to the image of Joe the Cherub (see album art)
We send a shout out to Jay (mediocrefatass) for posting a picture on our Facebook page (www.Facebook.com/DoubleDPodcast) of himself in a swanky Double D Podcast T shirt. &nbsp;Zen then tries to tell a story about Mexican Fancy Elf Boots spotted outside an Albertson's, which Ray promptly tries to derail. &nbsp;Zen perseveres and the story of the Mexican Clown Shoes makes it way out eventually.
ZZ Top plays us through our second break and then Zen relates another story, this time of a rather pathetic retired math teacher hitting on a young bank teller. &nbsp;Zen vows never to become this man, instead opting to grow into the less pathetic but admittedly more creepy "Party Grandpa" &nbsp;The show ends with speculation on Ray's future "Wedding of the Undead" in which Zen hopes to play some small part.

			<title>Double D Episode 38 - Live from Joe's Garage (Joe's Homebrewed IPA, Blonde and Faderade as well as Steel Reserve)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-38-live-from-joe-s-garage]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Best. &nbsp;Show. &nbsp;Ever. &nbsp;That's a bold statement, but even with the audio being less than stellar, after listening to this one we think you'll have to agree. &nbsp;Especially if you were there.
This was the first and only stop in the Double D Podcast's Spring Tour 2011. &nbsp;We broadcast live from Joe's Garage in Kingman, Arizona where we were helping celebrate Joe's Dirty Thirty Birthday Bash. &nbsp;Cousin Joe is a good man and a good friend and we were more than happy to pack up all the gear and set up at his house for this live remote broadcast. &nbsp;If you watched it live, you know that it was a wild time. &nbsp;If you missed the broadcast, just scroll down the page here for some of the video highlights. &nbsp;It was so much fun and we'd like to thank all the awesome people we met there for helping make this our most memorable episode yet.
We kicked it off with a quick Amber Alert for a missing boy (actually a childhood photo of Joe we had front and center on our desk the entire podcast (see album art)) and a little talk about Ray's Mexican Wizard Beard. &nbsp;We launched into our customary "What Are We Drinking?" segment . . . it was all incredible home-brewed beers that Joe is famous for crafting . . . we enjoyed an IPA, a creamy blonde ale and some jungle juice of Joe's own design called Faderade. &nbsp;We briefly talked about a Mexican cockfighting video (no joke) that we watched as the party was just getting started, featuring Roosters such as Chorpy, Dr. Mateo and Luis Lopez. &nbsp;It was horrible. &nbsp;And by horrible we mean awesome.
Zen recalled a traumatic childhood game called "Sauce" and we calculated the PDQ at the party. &nbsp;Then we listened to the first of many Roasts to be heard that night. &nbsp;Jeff stepped up to the microphone to Roast Joe with stories of Slumpbusting.
After our first break Jefe Smyth (Jeff Smith of Day Old Sushi) called in to tell us he was masturbating at work. &nbsp;He would have wished Joe a Happy Birthday, but he had no clue just who the hell Joe was. &nbsp;After that we launched into a special version of Stump the Mexican . . . Stump Joe, Name that Tune - The Hits of 1981 Edition! &nbsp;Special shout out to our 3 contestants: &nbsp;Shannon, Jesus and Ryan who all whooped Joe's ass easily.
After our second break Chuy D classed up the joint by playing a sweet cover of "Lay Me Down" followed by the real meat of the podcast - The Official Roast of Joe.
Cousin Dave roasted Joe's nuts with tales of Girl Scouts and a dead Prius.
Zen roasted Joe's nuts with a Top 5 list of "Things overheard when Joe rolled the Razor"
Ryan roasted Joe's nuts with the "Too Drunk to Fish" story.
Taryn roasted Joe's nuts with the El Palacio story and Native American racism.
Josh roasted Joe's nuts with the "It wasn't me, I'm a Fisherman!" story.
And finally Steve roasted Joe's nuts with the Porsche and a young girl story.
We closed out the show with Daniel C. totally destroying our Pinata filled with Mexican Candy. &nbsp;This show was a total blast and we hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we did recording it.
Salud!&nbsp;]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 37 - Dwight Kennkelle and Black Cankles (Pina Coladas)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-37-dwight-kennkelle-and-black-cankles]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Pina Coladas are imbibed during Episode 37, and while this might seem like a puss move and you're probably yelling, "Hey, the Double D Podcast is a celebration of BEER" we did so because we were saving ourselves for Episode 38. &nbsp;In hindsight, considering that this is being posted with Episode 38 done and in the can, drinking a nice, easy island fruity-fruit drink was the correct call. &nbsp;Because Episode 38 from Joe's Garage was a beer maelstrom.
Before we get very far in this show, our Titular Hero, Dwight Kennkelle, calls in. &nbsp;I don't know if it was the alcohol, or just a bad connection, but we heard his name as "Black Cankles" and since he didn't correct us, we ran with it the whole show. &nbsp;Dwight asks advice on women and also sings a nice song for us and quickly endeared himself as one of our all time favorite callers. &nbsp;We hope this is not the last we've heard from him.



We talk a little more about Ted Danson, Flagstaff's Pride and Joy, and why nobody has ever built a bar here in town called Cheers. &nbsp;We compare a small town's pride in it's one claim to fame with another small town. &nbsp;Winslow, Arizona has the Standin' On the Corner Park, based only on a small line in the Eagles popular song, "Take It Easy." &nbsp;And no, it's not Glenn Campbell or even Glenn Frey commemorated with a statue on the corner there. &nbsp;Apparently it's just some generic guitar man.

After the first break Ray introduces a new toy to the desk, his key chain Rock Em Sock Em Robot. &nbsp;Zen ponders a Movie Version of this retro fighting game, which we later learned after the broadcast is the Hugh Jackman vehicle called "Real Steel."



The show is now sponsored by Miller High Life since now one of it's hosts had his life sponsored by Miller High Life to the tune of one dollar. &nbsp;We entertain the notion of people sponsoring the show and having their donations acknowledged with macaroni art on the wall behind us.
We next rip into a good friend and co-worker, Shane Dween. &nbsp;He has an old folks home on his route and on Fridays he can be found hanging out with the old Betties at the ice cream social. &nbsp;(I wonder if he has the god-awful Rebecca Black song stuck in his head as he makes time with the old ladies?) &nbsp;We talk about vibrators so old the have to be crank-started and the notion of the "Dustgasm." &nbsp;Joe Fellers calls in to tell us that we are awful people.
Arrows "Someone You Knew But You've Hardly Meet" (mp3)  from "Modern Art &amp; Politics" (Hobbledehoy Record Co) Buy at iTunes Music Store Stream from Rhapsody Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Pina Coladas are imbibed during Episode 37, and while this might seem like a puss move and you're probably yelling, "Hey, the Double D Podcast is a celebration of BEER" we did so because we were saving ourselves for Episode 38. &nbsp;In hindsight, considering that this is being posted with Episode 38 done and in the can, drinking a nice, easy island fruity-fruit drink was the correct call. &nbsp;Because Episode 38 from Joe's Garage was a beer maelstrom.
Before we get very far in this show, our Titular Hero, Dwight Kennkelle, calls in. &nbsp;I don't know if it was the alcohol, or just a bad connection, but we heard his name as "Black Cankles" and since he didn't correct us, we ran with it the whole show. &nbsp;Dwight asks advice on women and also sings a nice song for us and quickly endeared himself as one of our all time favorite callers. &nbsp;We hope this is not the last we've heard from him.



We talk a little more about Ted Danson, Flagstaff's Pride and Joy, and why nobody has ever built a bar here in town called Cheers. &nbsp;We compare a small town's pride in it's one claim to fame with another small town. &nbsp;Winslow, Arizona has the Standin' On the Corner Park, based only on a small line in the Eagles popular song, "Take It Easy." &nbsp;And no, it's not Glenn Campbell or even Glenn Frey commemorated with a statue on the corner there. &nbsp;Apparently it's just some generic guitar man.

After the first break Ray introduces a new toy to the desk, his key chain Rock Em Sock Em Robot. &nbsp;Zen ponders a Movie Version of this retro fighting game, which we later learned after the broadcast is the Hugh Jackman vehicle called "Real Steel."



The show is now sponsored by Miller High Life since now one of it's hosts had his life sponsored by Miller High Life to the tune of one dollar. &nbsp;We entertain the notion of people sponsoring the show and having their donations acknowledged with macaroni art on the wall behind us.
We next rip into a good friend and co-worker, Shane Dween. &nbsp;He has an old folks home on his route and on Fridays he can be found hanging out with the old Betties at the ice cream social. &nbsp;(I wonder if he has the god-awful Rebecca Black song stuck in his head as he makes time with the old ladies?) &nbsp;We talk about vibrators so old the have to be crank-started and the notion of the "Dustgasm." &nbsp;Joe Fellers calls in to tell us that we are awful people.

			<title>Double D Episode 36 - What Dreams May Come (Bud Light Lime)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-36-what-dreams-may-come-poopy-pants-patties-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode we tackle the topic of dreams and dream interpretation. &nbsp;While drunk. &nbsp;This provides more honest and accurate discussion on the meanings of our dreams. &nbsp;We think.
This was our first live broadcast from the new Double D Studio, located 50 feet from our old studio. &nbsp;Now we're in the garage. &nbsp;With the new setup and the beer fridge within 5 feet of our new broadcast desk, we celebrate by drinking . . . Bud Light Lime?! &nbsp;Oh well. &nbsp;We happen to be fans of "Fruiting the Beer" when the beer calls for it. &nbsp;We wouldn't put limes in good beer, so don't get on our backs about it. &nbsp;If you like an occasional lime also, check out this cool gadget brought to our attention by Jay from the chatroom: The Limebrero.
We decide that from now on we will refer to female listeners of the show as "Booblets" and male listeners as "Borrachos." &nbsp;Until next week, that is, when we'll probably think of something else we like better. &nbsp;Ray tells us the best way to send a bowling ball down the lane using only his penis, and Zen decides that we should use some of our monies to sponsor a bowling team. &nbsp;The Double D Podcast Bowling Team coming soon.
We spend a little time talking about the pride of Flagstaff, Ted Danson, who called Flagstaff home while growing up.

In the second segment we talk about Dreams. &nbsp;Ray starts to tell a story about his father's recent dream and it's subsequent episode of domestic violence but this gets us spun into tangents discussing spouses sleeping in seperate beds and what our parents looked like having sex (Zen describes it as two black men with afros head-butting.) &nbsp;Zen ponders why nobody ever farts in their dreams. &nbsp;Why do people dream about losing their teeth? &nbsp;And finally Zen shares his dream involving hamburger patties formed from pooping in your pants.
Joe calls in to lighten the mood with tales of dreams involving drowning and adultery with deceased friends.

In the last segment Ray's live in maid Maria Conchita Lupita Gonzales calls in to serenade him with "Hooked on a Feeling." &nbsp;We discuss our plans for the live show to be recorded at Joe's Dirty Thirty Birthday Bash in Kingman, Az on April 30th.

			<title>Double D Episode 35 - 300 (Rolling Rock)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-35-300]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We start this episode off with some Rolling Rock, the tasty beer in the distinctive green bottle. &nbsp;We meant to have these during Episode 33, as the big "33" on the back of the bottle would have tied in nicely, but like everything else we do on this show, we messed that up big time.
We thank Robert Mesa for sending in some cool new designs to our email. &nbsp;We used one on a T shirt, which you can see (and buy!) by clicking here. &nbsp;If you have any artwork, be sure to send it in at doubledpodcast@gmail.com. &nbsp;To give our listeners more of an identity on the show, we come up with the term "Booblet" to refer to friends of the Double D. &nbsp;This sidetracks the conversation into other terms of affection, such as "Flipopotamus" and "Spicketti." &nbsp;We also announce plans for our new studio (which, if you've been watching the live show, you know has already happened.) &nbsp;For some reason, there is a lot of chatter in the chatroom and on our Facebook page demanding we put a stripper pole in the new studio. &nbsp;We're still working on it. &nbsp;
Finally, in the first segment, we talk briefly about pagers. &nbsp;We flash book to the good old days back in the late 80's/early 90's when the only way to get hold of your friends was to beep them and then wait for them to find a pay phone. &nbsp;Or you could send a numeric message, such as "911", "143" or even the infamous "5318008" &nbsp;We wonder what the heck the option is on today's cellphone voice mail when you are asked if you'd like to "leave a numeric page." &nbsp;We wonder, that is, until Cousin Dave actually sends us one during the show!
First break song - Reel Big Fish performing Snoop Doggy Dog
Congratulations go out to the titular subject of this episode, Uncle Dave, Cousin Dave's dad and Biscuit Ray's uncle. &nbsp;He bowled his first ever perfect game, called a "300" even though no Persians were defeated that night. &nbsp;There were a lot of sweaty, muscled Spartans hanging out though. &nbsp;This gets us on the subject of bowling, how hard it is to get a perfect score, and what the rewards for doing so are. &nbsp;What exactly IS sterling silver? &nbsp;We then take another trip in the wayback machine to November 1987, courtesy of an old copy of Penthouse. &nbsp;Remarkably, this copy from 1987 had a crazy quote from none other than Charlie Sheen, and also had an incredibly accurate drawing of "the most interesting man in the world" from the Dos Equis commercials. &nbsp;If you plan on being in attendance at Joe's Dirty 30 Birthday Bash in Kingman on April 30th, we'll be giving this Penthouse away!

Finally we listen to and discuss the following video, which we dub The Worst Mashup Ever. &nbsp;It is foul, wrong, way over the line and completely catchy with a great hook.

			<title>Double D Episode 34 - Very Specific Porncast (Kiltlifter)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-34-very-specific-porncast]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Before you decide not to download this based solely on the title, you should know that this is not an episode just about porn. &nbsp;Instead we focus on the idea of "very specific porn", that is, videos and images suited to very, very specific tastes. &nbsp;More on that later.
First, we kick off the show as we always do with an introduction to the beer we're drinking that night. &nbsp;Episode 34's brand is Kiltlifter, brewed in our home state of Arizona. &nbsp;This leads to a brief discussion on kilts, and whether you have to "go commando" when you wear one.
Next we discuss Sonoran Hot Dogs, a tasty treat found in Southern Arizona, especially at one of our favorite dining destinations (aha! &nbsp;a Double D) - El Guero Canelo in Tucson, Arizona. &nbsp;We consumed several Sonoran Dogs while enjoying Wrestlemania 27. &nbsp;Triple H and The Undertaker owned the Pay per View, but we also thought Snooki pulled off a surprising move - the "Hot Pork Turnover" to "Beer Belly Flop." &nbsp;What do wrestlers do when they get a surprise erection in the ring?

We congratulate our first annual March Madness of Hotties Winner, Mila Kunis. &nbsp;We also send out congratulations to the following Double D Listeners who included their email addresses with their votes, thus entering (and winning) the drawing for Double D Gear.

wesailatdusk@*******.com - Winner of a Double D Shot Glass
Our winners need to email us at doubledpodcast@gmail.com from their above email addresses to let us know where to ship their prizes to. &nbsp;Congrats!
Next we discuss our titular topic, Very Specific Porn. &nbsp;Zen espouses the idea of "TV Commercial Pretty" while Ray likes the idea of a midget riding a goat while smoking a cigar and wearing a propellor beanie. &nbsp;Seriosly, though, we create an ideal video during our talk consisting of a well endowed girl wearing a tank top and high heels, with a ponytail, running on a treadmill in high heels. &nbsp;We didn't have to go to porn sites to find this. &nbsp;It took us exactly 5 seconds on YouTube to locate our Very Specific Porn.

			<title>Double D Episode 33 - Down to Two (Budweiser American Ale)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-33-down-to-two]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode of the Double D Podcast we take our field of women from the Sweet Sixteen down to our Final Two. &nbsp;Before that happens, however, we have the usual nonsense.
First, we introduce a new dance called "Doin' The Goosh" which basically involves inserting tab A into slot B. &nbsp;On yourself. &nbsp;Then we get into the customary "What Are We Drinking Tonight" which this show is Budweiser's American Ale. &nbsp;It's pretty much Budweiser in a fancy label. &nbsp;
We pay tribute this show to the nation of Japan, which was beseiged by earthquakes and tsunami. &nbsp;We show our respect by talking about how Aflac fired spokesduck voiceman Gilbert Gottfried for his insensitive comments on Twitter poking fun at japan. &nbsp;We ponder who should voice the duck next.
Continuing our love for the Japanese people, we play a little J-Pop during the first break.
&nbsp;


Next we talk briefly about sports going in the U.S. at the time. &nbsp;Congrats to the U of A Wildcats for making the Elite Eight in the REAL March Madness. &nbsp;We place some bets on the NHL playoffs: &nbsp;if the Flyers go out in the first round Zen has to drink a 40 of Steel Reserve, pretty much the worst alcohol on the planet. &nbsp;If the Sharks win the Stanley Cup, Ray has to shave down to a Hitler Mustache. &nbsp;We preview Wrestlemania in anticipation of Wrestlemania 27.
The next segment owes a lot of it's greatness to the good people in the chatroom who called in and chimed in on chat to help us pick our final 2 hotties. &nbsp;Special thanks to Cousin Dave, Cousin Joe and Joe's friend the sexy-voiced Sarah for making picks on the air. &nbsp;Thanks also to the guys in chat for keeping things funny for us as we voted each matchup, especially mediocrefatass and new friend Mike "Hawk" Rectum Lover. &nbsp;Sarah was a podcast virgin before she called, but she got deflowered and Double D'd and will never be the same.
Second verse, same as the first as we play some more Japanese pop.
&nbsp;


Maria Conchita Lupita Gonzales, now residing illegally in the U.S. as Ray's live in maid, calls in with sordid tales of "vagina in the tube" and "Oprah magazines." &nbsp;We eat a little Mexican Candy. &nbsp;The lollipop is shaped like a cooked, whole chicken and is named headless chicken, but it was much tastier than that.
We reveal our final two contestants in the March Madness 2011, Salma Hayek and, as Ray pronounces it, "My-luh Kunnis." &nbsp;Then the show closes out with Zen's Coastal Nervous tales of homeless, racist vets and amateur porn shoots.
Final Song -&nbsp;

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-32-much-madness]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[March Madness. &nbsp;Basketball. &nbsp;Collegiate athletics. &nbsp;Pride and rivalries. &nbsp;Who gives a crap? &nbsp;Throw out your brackets from your Sunday paper and instead help us run down the real March Madness . . . which of our handpicked 64 hot women deserves to be called the Double D Podcast Ultimate Hottie of 2011?
The show begins with our new intro theme song and with the customary "What are we drinking tonight" question. &nbsp;Answer - Devil's Ale from SanTan Brewing.
First Break Song (a reminder that whenever we post one of the following music links with the album art and options to buy the song, the first link that says mp3 is a free download of the entire song courtesy of the Independent Online Distribution Alliance at iodapromonet.com)

The Primitives "Rattle My Cage" (mp3)  from "Never Kill a Secret - EP" (Fortuna POP!) Buy at iTunes Music Store Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album
We get right into our bracket after the break with Zen and Ray tackling the entire field of 64 women broken down into 8 8-contestant conferences. &nbsp;We discuss each girl briefly and randomly assign seeding positions to some, mostly based on breast size. &nbsp;The field gets pared down to 32 and then Cousin Dave calls in for a little game of Stump the Mexican, Charlie Sheen Movies edition.
Second break song

The Krayolas "Fruteria (The Fruit Cup Song)" (mp3)  from "Fruteria (The Fruit Cup Song)" (Talking Taco Music) Buy at iTunes Music Store Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album
&nbsp;
Cousin Joe and MrsStrong from the chatroom both call in to help us get our bracket down to the Sweet Sixteen. &nbsp;There's plenty of surprises and upsets to go around.
Last two songs this episode:

&nbsp;

The American Scene "Killed Off in the Second Act" (mp3)  from "By Way of Introduction" (Pure Noise Ent.) Buy at iTunes Music Store More On This Album
Stay tuned to the very end to hear a very special and touching Happy Birthday shoutout. &nbsp;We're kidding, it's actually Cousin Joe singing drunkenly.]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 31 - Gnomespotting on Spam Mountain</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-podcast-episode-31-gnomespotting-on-spam-mountain]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[I cut the whole first segment out of the show. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Two words - Charlie Sheen. &nbsp;It seemed topical and interesting at the time of the broadcast, but as we all know it was the fastest internet meme to jump the shark EVER. &nbsp;Within a week every podcast, blog, talk show and news outlet had played it TO DEATH. &nbsp;Kids were holding up "Duh, Winning" signs at WWE wrestling events. &nbsp;By the time I got around to editing this show for release, it all seemed old and antiquated. &nbsp;So I cut it out. &nbsp;Fuck Charlie Sheen.
Anyway, the show opens with a little AC/DC, thanks to a suggestion by themediocrefatass in our chat room. &nbsp;Thanks, Jay. &nbsp;The first segment flies by in about 7 minutes, thanks to the aforementioned cuts. &nbsp;After the first break, we get into the real meat of the show - Gnomespotting. &nbsp;It's a little game we've been playing on Facebook and on our cell phones. &nbsp;Real simple, snap a picture of a gnome and post it or MMS it to your friends. &nbsp;It's now expanded to include lawn jockeys, ceramic mexicans and all sorts of lawn accoutrements. &nbsp;We argue over racist gnomes, Hitler gnomes, KKK gnomes and introduce a new hippie word: &nbsp;Birkenstomping.
The second seg ends with a quick discussion of Back to the Future, and whether Doc Brown would have been disappointed with his original plans to jump forward into the future 25 years from November 5th, 1985. &nbsp; That's 2010 for you math wiz kids out there. &nbsp;We guess he might have been pretty let down, that is until we showed him internet porn.
The third segment, after a little Mexican candy, winds its way toward porn video games. &nbsp;From humble beginnings on Spam Mountain and stick figure nudists on the Atari 2600, through it's akward adolescence in Leisure Suit Larry and early Flash Games, all the way to it's glorious adulthood now in games like Grand Theft Auto IV, adult content in video games has been a weird, wild trip. &nbsp;The topic gets sidetracked when Ray tells the best story he's ever told in the history of this podcast. &nbsp;It's worth listening all the way through the show to get to this gem. &nbsp;8mm film and early stag movies played on the wall of his house. &nbsp;Yeah.
It's episode 31 of the Double D and we hope you enjoy it!
(our thoughts and prayers are with Maria Conchita Lupita Gonzales. &nbsp;may she find her way home)

			<title>Double D Episode 30 - Heavy Burtation</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-30-heavy-burtation]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode was broadcast and recorded during the 2011 Academy Awards, so you would expect that the Oscars would dominate the conversation for most of the night, right? &nbsp;WRONG! &nbsp;Who gives a damn about the Oscars? &nbsp;Not us, as we focus instead in the first segment on this medical study that proves that staring at a women's breasts for 10 minutes or more each day can actually increase the lifespan of the average male. &nbsp;So next time a woman tells you, "Hey buddy, my eyes are up here" just reply that you're getting your cardio in for the day.
The main part of the show, in the second segment, centers around reporters losing their shit live on the air. &nbsp;The most recent and notable case involves Serene Branson of Channel 2 L.A. who many people thought was having a stroke while covering the Grammys. &nbsp;Turns out she just had a migraine. &nbsp;So it's okay to laugh. &nbsp;Really.
&nbsp;

And of course some chucklehead had to remix it to some House music and put it up on Youtube.
&nbsp;

We loved these next two gentlemen.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
Finally, in the last segment, we examine the question "Does it HAVE to be on Blu-Ray?" &nbsp;Spoiler: &nbsp;the answer is YES. &nbsp;Don't forget to subscribe to the show on iTunes and please, please, please leave us a review on our iTunes page. &nbsp;The link to get to our iTunes page is over there on the right! &nbsp;-------&gt;
Thanks for listening and tell someone about the show! &nbsp;We'll love you for it!]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 29 - Double Dogs</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-29-double-dogs]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[First off, an apology for the sound quality during the first fifteen minutes of the show. &nbsp;When we originally broadcast Episode 29 on Justin.tv, I was so worried about the Hot Dog Eating Challenge that I actually forgot to hit record and so didn't have anything for the first segment. &nbsp;I orginally considered just leaving it out and starting the audio podcast with the second segment, but it was just too good to omit. &nbsp;So I did the only thing I could think of . . . I went to justin.tv, played the video and pulled the audio from that. &nbsp;It's crappy third-generation sound but it's better than nothing and I did my best to clean it up.
So our show begins with the 2 hot dogs in 1 minute challenge first set forth by the Puck Podcast's Eddie Garcia. &nbsp;We fared about as well as Eddie did. &nbsp;The audio is not quite as entertaining as the video.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
After failing miserably, and with mouths full of cheap hot dogs and half chewed buns, we quickly shuffle off to our first break. &nbsp;Oh! &nbsp;Did I mention that we got super-pranked by Timothy Cronley Jr, who posted our phone number on 4chan? &nbsp;It took as a minute or two to figure this out when we fielded our first weirdo phone call of the night. &nbsp;Props to "The Black Man with the Sharpie up his Pooper" for being a wonderfully entertaining, if not a little bit high, guest caller. &nbsp;Props also to themediocrefatass for keeping us laughing in the chat room while all this was going on.
In the second segment we covered some news stories, mainly involving stupid criminals in the Northern Arizona region. &nbsp;

Arizona's push to ban children from riding in the open beds of pickup trucks
The foolish Cheba Hut employee who made an illegal turn in front of a cop at 2:40 in the morning while driving the weed-festooned Pot-mobile
"Trent" the waterhead tagger who desecrated a centuries old petroglyph with his name and then answered to that same name when the authorities rolled up on him.

After our second break we come back with some rather interesting jury stories. &nbsp;What seemed like a pretty dry subject at the time yielded some pretty good tales. &nbsp;We closed out the show with some Scissor Sisters.

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-28-take-a-look-at-me-now]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Brown Shugga always wins. &nbsp;Keep that in mind as you listen to one of our best episodes yet. &nbsp;Brown Shugga laid us low and kept the laughs rollin' all night long.
"Superconnected" by Broken Social Scene opens the show, after which we begin by talking about "The Big Game." &nbsp;We talk about what we were drinking that night, as the Double D does often stand for Drunk and Drunker. &nbsp;What makes some gay men have the stereotypical "gay" voice? &nbsp; Cardo and Joe demonstrate their silky smooth, golden radio voices. &nbsp;Ray celebrates 25 years of government service and we help him celebrate by playing Stump the Mexican, the top ten films of 1985 Edition. &nbsp;Shane Dween calls in from south of the tracks to be our first contestant.
Be warned, during this game Cardo drops the biggest audio bomb in the history of the podcast when he asks a question about the 1985 movie, "Cocoon."
The Cure take us into a break with the Closer mix of Close to Me, and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes bring us back with their cover of Leavin' on a Jet Plane.
Right about the time the beers really start to kick in, we disclose the songs we would cry ourselves to sleep to after a bad breakup. &nbsp;Joe gives a top 5 list while Zen can only contribute "Against All Odds" with it's unforgettable line, "Take a look at me noooooowwwww . . ." &nbsp;We break down the formula behind making a successful Country Sad Song. &nbsp;When masturbating, most men are sprinting for the finish line, not taking their time. &nbsp;We share memories of reaching 3rd base for the first time, and Ray teaches us "The Pitchfork Manuever." &nbsp;Anal Bead education and Joe shares some girl pics on his iPhone.
Finally, The Used play us out of a night we'll not soon forget. &nbsp;Mainly because we recorded it. &nbsp;Now you can listen in and enjoy it as well.]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 27 - Snooki Gets Salsaghettied</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-27-snooki-gets-salsaghettied]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Cousin Dave's wife, affectionately given the alias of Snooki for this episode, joins us in the studio to spill her guts on her husband's lovemaking skills. &nbsp;Cousin Joe from Kingman also made the long drive out to sit in on this episode.
We began by drinking some Roscoe's Amber Ale, which brought back childhood memories of Roscoe P. Coltrane. &nbsp;Cousin Joe brought some home brewed C Diff Infectious Ale. &nbsp;Joe is rewarded with a spot on the Double D Professional Wrestling Team and is given his own luchador mask ( a brown paper bag with a large hole cut into it.)
Phantom Planet covers Jackson Browne's "Somebody's Baby."
Stinky calls in from Oregon. &nbsp;Bobby Ganoosh calls in and promptly hangs up before we can ask him any hard hitting questions. &nbsp;Zen provides a top 5 list of the 5 things more unreliable than his computer. &nbsp;Next we get to the heart and soul of this episode. &nbsp;We interview Snooki about all things Cousin Dave - is he a kind, gentle lover? &nbsp;How did he perform on their wedding night? &nbsp;Does he give her a goodnight kiss? &nbsp;How is he hung? &nbsp;Be prepared to find out more about Cousin Dave than you ever wanted to know.
After tales of Dave's wedding night, we get Joe's tales of homemade XXX video. &nbsp;Zen provides tales of rose tattoos and Chevy vans.
Corporate Whore performs "You Want" followed by The Descendents "Nothing With You"
We hit up the Mexican Candy again and then our show devolves and hits it's lowest point ever when we, for all intents and purposes, film softcore food-fetish porn. &nbsp;If you didn't watch live, you missed Ray and Joe smacking Snooki's face with the Mexican Candy called Salsaghetti. &nbsp;The audio is entertaining as well.
Finally we calm down and get serious for a somber, scientific look at the question of whether or not auto-fellatio makes one gay or if it is simply masturbation.

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-26-don-t-f-with-me-man-cub]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The show gets off on the wrong foot when we immediately suggest the creation of a novelty candy that would involve sucking a pulpy red juice out of a fake tampon. &nbsp; Things go downhill from there. &nbsp; Zen tells the tale of the cropdusting he suffered, also known as the "Mutton Bomb." &nbsp; This prompts Cardo to call in with a similar story. &nbsp;Rocky calls in soon after from his 80's party and promises drunken voice mails to follow. &nbsp;We're still waiting on those, by the way.
&nbsp;

&nbsp;
After the first break we recall our recent trip down to the desert home of the U of A Icecats, Tucson, Arizona. &nbsp;Flea Market stories are told. &nbsp;We hope everyone gets a chance to visit the Tanque Verde Swap Meet, where you can buy Hockey Skates, Luchador Masks, AirSoft BB guns, lingerie, mexican candy and assorted tools and cellphone cases.
Congratulations to the Northern Arizona University Ice Jacks who played a thrilling game against the U of A Icecats, beating them 5 - 4. &nbsp;That didn't stop a drunken U of A student sitting in front of us from harassing NAU's backup goalie, a player's dad and several teenage girls. &nbsp;Hey, Bieber!

&nbsp;
Next came our Luchador segment. &nbsp;We introduce our alter egos: &nbsp;The Flippin' Dutch, The Giant Squirrel and Big Dick, also known as Poontangarang. &nbsp;We flesh out our wrestlers with intro songs and finishing moves, including the Nutcraker, the Bushy-tailed Bomb, The Dutch Rudder and the Halo Halo Smash.
Then we continue our tradition of partaking in some Mexican Candy, one pretty good and one God Awful mess that looked like period blood.
Speaking of period blood, Joe Fellers calls in next from Laughlin, Nevada with stories of the Father-Son Wobbly H.
Finally, Ray gives the episode it's title when he tells us that the children's movie "The Jungle Book" contained the song, "Don't Fuck With Me, Man Cub."

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-25-stump-the-podcast-bum]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Anyone know a good ditch I can throw my desktop PC into? &nbsp;After another long, rocky start in which my computer had to be restarted several times, we finally go the show up and running. &nbsp;With such a late start on a school night, attendance was low, but it was a good show regardless.
We started off with some old business, including a voice mail from Baby Brother Cardo, fresh out of the hospital where he underwent treatment for Nicole-I Richie. &nbsp;We also apologize to Shane Dween, former contest winner. &nbsp;Then we talk about Radio Bum, the homeless man with the Golden Voice who will be America's newest millionaire (if he doesn't blow it all on crack, that is.) &nbsp;We decide that what our podcast needs to go viral also is our very own Bum, and we make plans to find one.
In the middle segment we again play "Stump the Mexican" with Joe facing off against Biscuit Ray in a little movie trivia. &nbsp;Hockey movies, 4 letter movie titles and Cheech movies all play a role. &nbsp;Ha!
Finally we look forward to our weekend field trip to Tucson, where we will watch hockey and imbibe many beers.
Enjoy the show!]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 24 - The Legend of Sancho Claus (Joe's Pepperfish Homebrew and Brandy Eggnog)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-24-the-legend-of-sancho-claus]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Those of you who joined us live already know that this show was one of the best. &nbsp;For those of you who will be downloading and listening to this episode for the very first time, you're in for a treat.
Baby brother Cardo Diaz and friend of the show Joe Fellers of Joe's Garage and Mojo Potatoes Inc. join us in the studio to drink some eggnog, partake in some brews, share some Christmas memories, tell some stories and jokes, help flesh out the legend and mythos of that shadowy Mexican character Sancho Claus and generally have a rowdy good time.
We won't get into too much detail about what all was said on the show. &nbsp;We'll leave that for you to discover and enjoy. &nbsp;As a little teaser, however, we will let you know that you will find out the story behind Turd Knuckle, sex with plastic onion rings, seaport whores named Brandy, what was in the presents Zen gave to each co-host and much, much more. &nbsp;This is a show chock full of fun at almost two hours long.
* Chuy D sang a couple home grown Christmas carols for us, both about Sancho Claus. &nbsp;Here are the lyrics to "Sancho, the Foot-Long Lover", sung to the tune of "Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer", words by Zen DeHoag.
You know Zapata and Juarez, Costilla and Villa,
Lopez, Mysterio and Carlos Mencia . . .
But do you recall,
The most horny Mexican of all?
&nbsp;
Sancho, the 12-inch cock man,
Really had a foot long hose,
And when the Chicas touched it,
You would even swear it grows,
&nbsp;
All of the pissed off putos,
would lock up their poo-nay-nay,
With Pistolas at the ready
They'd yell, "Sancho stay away!"
&nbsp;
But on every Christmas eve,
Sancho would sneak in,
He'd ride their chochas all night long,
And leave them with a grin . . .
&nbsp;
The Senoritas loved him,
As they all moaned with pride,
"Sancho the foot long lover,
You can fill our insides!"
&nbsp;

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-22-halo-halo]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[After a week off to celebrate Thanksgiving, we're back with one of our best episodes ever. &nbsp;A special thanks to the folks over at Joe's Garage for joining us live while partying down out in Kingman, AZ.
We started the show by wrapping up our look at racism in America. &nbsp;Yes, Virginia, there are racist terms for the Dutch. &nbsp;It all started with the origin of the word "Yankee" and it's history with the derogatory term, "John Cheese." &nbsp;What about Dutch courage, Going Dutch and the ever popular Dutch Oven?! &nbsp;We spout misinformation on what might have been the origin of other popular racist catchphrases, including "The Chinese Fire Drill," "Indian Giver" and that blast from the past, "N**ger knocking." &nbsp;Don't try these at home.
After a little cover of Rocket Man by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, we lighten the mood by launching into trivia and a little game we like to call, "Stump the Mexican." &nbsp;We'll start playing this game more and more often in future shows, and we invite everyone to call in and test their knowledge against Biscuit Ray. &nbsp;The rules are simple, answer more questions correctly than Ray can and you will have successfully stumped the Mexican. &nbsp;Cousin Dave squares off first in the category of "The States." &nbsp;Joe takes round 2 in the category of "Internet Acronyms." &nbsp;In this best of 3 format, Biscuit Ray gets swept in his debut.
Right before the break, which is handled by The Breeders' Cannonball, Ray is introduced to his punishment for losing Stump the Mexican. &nbsp;It is a jar of our titular dessert, Halo Halo, a Filipino traditional dish consisting of tropical fruits and beans.
When we get back from the break, Ray dutifully gulps down a spoonful or two. &nbsp;This leads to all sorts of horrible Asian stereotyping and eventually to our discussion with Joe about the first time he received an Asian Massage, complete with "Release." &nbsp;The story is too good to miss, and since we decided to go out on a high note, it ends the show.
Beer consumed during this episode: &nbsp;Sam Adams Winter Lager.
Closing Song: &nbsp;Life is Shit by The Dead Milkmen.

			<title>Double D Episode 21 - Thanksgiving Food and Racism (Four Loko)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-21-thanksgiving-food-and-racism]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Happy Birthday to our podcast! &nbsp;21 - it's finally old enough to drink! &nbsp;We decide to celebrate by downing a concoction that is rumored to be banned in most counties in the near future - Four Loko, or Four Maxed&nbsp;to be exact. &nbsp;We begin with Grape and then move on the Citrus - or Green Death flavor as we find out.
This show is dominated by talk of food, Thanksgiving, racism as it applies to restaurant names and other tummy tickling delights. &nbsp;Joe Joe calls in and joins the fun, we hope you enjoy it!
Top Racist Restaurant Names, according to the Double D Podcast:

The Flippin' Dutch
Cracker Barrel
On the Border (which Zen mistakenly refers to as Over the Border)
Sambo's
The Coon Chicken Inn

We also talk about some fast food joints we and some of our listeners have worked in. &nbsp;Jack in the Box and their famous tacos. &nbsp;How much it sucks to work at a Mickey D's when you're out of nuggets and some Meth-Mom is in the drive through having a meth-fueled nugget Rage. &nbsp;Witness:
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
We also discuss this amazing video, put out by Zen's favorite podcast A Mediocre Time with Tom and Dan :
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
Music played during the breaks this episode:
&nbsp;
The Mommyheads "Help Me" (mp3)  from "You're Not A Dream" (Bladen County Records) Buy at iTunes Music Store Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The Mommyheads "Work" (mp3)  from "Finest Specimens" (Dromedary Records) More On This Album
&nbsp;
(Right click on the Song Title to download the mp3 for free)
As it is Thanksgiving, we'd like to send a big THANK YOU to everyone who listens to this podcast. &nbsp;We don't make a dime from this, in fact it costs us quite a few pesos to put this together every week. &nbsp;All we ask is that you leave us a review on iTunes and that you share the show around with friends. &nbsp;We are truly thankful for all our listeners and hope you have as much fun with this as we do!]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 20 - The Buttery Taste of Water (Harp Lager)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-20-the-buttery-taste-of-water]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Episode 20 is our second live broadcast and we might be getting a little closer to having this "live" thing down. &nbsp;A few hiccups here and there but all in all a successful show.
We kick things off with Just a Gigolo, which leads us into our first discussion topic - Shitty songs that get stuck in your head. &nbsp;How do they get in there and how do you get them out? &nbsp;The Story of Eddie Murphy and his girl that wants to party all the time.
What we were drinking during the recording of Episode 20. &nbsp;Harp Lager, which didn't score too high over at ratebeer.com. &nbsp;Also ButterShots Butterscotch Schapps. &nbsp;This was consumed as well as used to cleanse the palate during a blind taste test. &nbsp;
We then received our first live call of the night: &nbsp;Larry from CA. &nbsp;He quickly disrespected Zen's "Princess Leia" headphones and then asked Ray to retell the tale of corkscrew pig peckers and general animal debauchery. &nbsp;Mexican beers brewed in Chicago. &nbsp;The birthday of the Marine Corps.
Our first break song, featuring this episode's band, Tumbledown.
&nbsp;
Tumbledown "Break Out of History" (mp3)  from "Tumbledown" (End Sounds) Buy at iTunes Music Store Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album
&nbsp;
The Great Water Taste Test. &nbsp;This may have been scientifically flawed, not only because we used butterscotch schnapps to cleanse our palates, but also because Zen chose a Lemon flavored bottled water as one of the test subjects. &nbsp;The debate rages on . . .
What exactly is in a Black and Tan? &nbsp;Then, our Mexican Candy segment. &nbsp;Pico Diana, aka the Mexican Pixie Stick.
60 Hours a week at The U.S. Coastal Nervous. &nbsp;Stupid Things You Hear at Work. &nbsp;Our next live call in, courtesy of Cousin Dave. &nbsp;Having Fun Yet?
Our second song from Tumbledown.
&nbsp;
Tumbledown "Dead Man Walking" (mp3)  from "Empty Bottle" (End Sounds) Buy at iTunes Music Store Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album
&nbsp;
Voice Mails. &nbsp;2 from Jefe. &nbsp;One from new listener Joe Fellers. &nbsp;Egotastic.com
Voice mails were interrupted by a live call from Chuy D, who was checking in from the Toga Party, complete with beer pong, an Amber Bock keg and 50 Roman Revelers. &nbsp;
We get back to Egotastic and the deliciously pregnant Jessica Alba, who Zen first noticed in the B Movie Idle Hands. &nbsp;Nobody's hands were idle while watching this one.
Our final voice mail of the evening crowns Shane Dween as our "Red Stripe/Pinstripe" contest winner. &nbsp;Congratulations to Shane, who wins a Double D T Shirt from our CafePress store on Biscuit Ray.
Dont forget to follow us at Justin TV and on Facebook to be alerted when our show is going Live next!

			<title>Double D Episode 19 and a Half - Time Traveling Sex Robots LIVE (Ranger IPA)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-19-and-a-half-time-traveling-sex-robots-live]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Our first Live Internet Broadcast was a complete success! &nbsp;If you called bullshit, you are correct. &nbsp;It more closely resembled a train wreck than a success, but we pulled it off nonetheless. &nbsp;
First of all, I mistakenly called this episode "Episode 19" throughout the recording, somehow forgetting that Episode 19 - Worst Of already existed. &nbsp;Whoops. &nbsp;We'll just call this one 19 and a Half.
Secondly, it took us forever to get everything straightened out and working. &nbsp;Our stream is now up and running over at Justin.tv which will remain at www.justin.tv/doubledpodcast&nbsp;- so check us out there and click on the "follow" button to be notified when we are going LIVE. &nbsp;We also have a new phone number so that people can call into the show during a live recording. &nbsp;If you are in Northern Arizona it's a free local call, for everyone else use the area code 928. &nbsp;928-255-4767. &nbsp;Also, there is a chat room you can use to chat with other viewers and to try and distract us while we record.
Third, we didn't have a good way to display that number while we were broadcasting. &nbsp;We went super old school and wrote it on a dry erase board. &nbsp;That'll be gone next show. &nbsp;Ray challenged me to have it scrolling on screen by the next time and that should be no problem.
Once we were up and running we laid down a pretty decent episode of the Double D. &nbsp;We started off as always with the Celebration of Beer and named what we were drinking. &nbsp;For me (Zen) it was the Belgium Brewing Co.'s Ranger IPA. &nbsp;Ray took a step back in time and consumed a 40 oz. of King Cobra.
Our first caller of the night was Jonathan Whitehorn. &nbsp;He helped us ease into our first topic, which was Sex Robots and Robot fetishes. &nbsp;We queried each other and what kind of robot we could copulate with.
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
The New Radicals play the first break with Mother We Just Can't Get Enough
Next we tackle the latest internet meme, the supposed Time Traveler captured on film during the 1928 premiere of Charlie Chaplin's film "The Circus." &nbsp;We easily throw out some obvious reasons this can't be real, but then ask the question where we would rather travel in time to visit. &nbsp;Here's the clip of the supposed time traveling old woman. &nbsp;Is this really a cell phone she is holding?
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers cover the second break with Beautiful Disaster.
We are joined in our last segment by Jefe and then Cousin Dave. &nbsp;A quick round of Chat Roulette ends the show.
Rancid plays the outro with Roots Radicals.

			<title>Double D Episode 19 - Worst Of</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-19-worst-of]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Really, the title says it all, doesn't it? &nbsp;This is our first ever "Worst Of" episode. &nbsp;We say "worst of" because we set out to make a "best of" episode and couldn't find enough good material to make more than a 5 minute show.
Seriously, though, this episode was created because co-host and main beer supplier Biscuit Ray was out with a cold. &nbsp;Or herpes. &nbsp;We're still waiting on a doctor's diagnosis. &nbsp;Whatever the illness, Ray could not be in the studio this week, so we did what we had to do to make sure some sort of a new episode made it out on schedule.
Listen in and hear the very first intro to the very first episode of The Double D Podcast as well as a couple clips from the old Zen and Peace Show. &nbsp;Hear about Zombie Sex and Tequila Sunrise. &nbsp;You'll also be treated to a clip taken from the first episode Cousin Dave ever sat in on as well as the first introduction of the man known as Jefe.
Make sure you stick around to the end to hear a little teaser about where the show is headed next. &nbsp;It's an important announcement and you don't want to miss it.
Songs for this episode include:
&nbsp;
The Besties "Zombie Song" (mp3)  from "Singer" (Skipping Stones Records) Buy at iTunes Music Store Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album

Footstone "Watermelon" (mp3)  from "Lippy" (Dromedary Records) Buy at iTunes Music Store Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album

			<title>Double D Episode 18 - Chuy D (Ska Brewing's Pinstripe Red Ale)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-18-chuy-d]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We've been waiting a long time for this. &nbsp;Guess we were really waiting on a special occasion to finally get this guy in the studio, and that occasion ended up being the debut of his new band at The Orpheum in Flagstaff, opening up for Whiskey Rodeo. &nbsp;That's right, Biscuit Ray finally dragged his son, Robert Diaz aka Chuy D, onto the podcast. &nbsp;Chuy brought his guitar and a thirst for beer . . . a good night was bound to happen.
What we were drinking: &nbsp;we started off with some leftover Dundee Oktoberfest brews and then quickly moved on to our surprise beer of the night. &nbsp;Surprise because we left it up to our intern to pick out a beer at her own discretion. &nbsp;Luckily for us, our intern has excellent taste and we ended up with a sixer of Ska Brewing Company's Pin Stripe Red Ale. &nbsp;We talk about Ska Brewing and some of their other brews. &nbsp;Modus Hoperandi. &nbsp;We discuss switching the name of the podcast from Double D to Triple B. &nbsp;We hear the true story behind Pin Stripe Red Ale, courtesy of Ray's "White Voice." &nbsp;
Next Ray issued the "Pin Stripe Challenge." &nbsp;The first listener to email or call in with the exact number of times Ray mistakenly says "Pinstripe" when he meant to say "Red Stripe" in Episode 4 will receive a Double D Podcast T Shirt from our CafePress store. &nbsp;No joke.
"Eliminnyate" &nbsp;Diaz by injection. &nbsp;A little Sharks talk. &nbsp;The Dutchipino Air Mine. &nbsp;Zen reads a Top 5 list courtesy of the Double D Home Office located at the Bunny Ranch in Nevada.
Plowed by Sponge
Snuff - really not good for you. &nbsp;An in depth discussion of Chuy D's new band, The Electric Army. &nbsp;Rock out with your socks out.
Visit the Electric Army Here.
Whiskey Rodeo, the Flagstaff band that Electric Army opened for. &nbsp;The Shot Box and drunken Kalil workers.
Mercy Me by Alkaline Trio
Chuy D graces us with a few songs. &nbsp;And by grace I mean saves our mediocre podcast by bringing something into the studio that never has appeared before: &nbsp;real talent.
The Tiger Song from The Hangover and a medley of Jason Mraz hits.
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
Christmas plans and Halloween costume plans. &nbsp;Our Facebook shout out of the week.
Chuy D outros the podcast with one final song.]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 17 - Fingers Crossed (Samuel Smith's Tadcaster Oatmeal Stout and Dundee Oktoberfest)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-17-fingers-crossed]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Right away you'll notice a new theme song. &nbsp;Yeah, that's the Miami Vice Theme by Jan Hammer. &nbsp;Don't worry, it's not a pemanent change. &nbsp;But we did lose everything when we had our latest hard drive failure, and that includes our theme song. &nbsp;Any musicians out there who can make a new theme song for us will be rewarded with a Double D Podcast T shirt if we use their song.
The show starts innocently enough with Hee Haw talk. &nbsp;Why Old Men watch Hee Haw. &nbsp;Using different voices with different people. &nbsp;The "Fingers Crossed" story.
Our first live call - Destin Kerr.
followed closely by
Our second live call - Jonathan Whitehorn
What we were drinking - Samuel Smith's Tadcaster Oatmeal Stout. &nbsp;Dundee Oktoberfest. &nbsp;Putting beer in your breakfast cereal. &nbsp;The English Pint and other odd units of measurement.
First break song is The Clap by The Giggles.
XXX Day. &nbsp;In laymen's terms 10-10-10. &nbsp;Old school vs. new school porn can be defined in one word - bush. &nbsp;
The new American Sex Survey and it's results. &nbsp;41 positions or 41 sexual practices. &nbsp;Sex with fruit and pies. &nbsp;And fruit pies. &nbsp;Fleshlight folks - where are you? &nbsp;Looking desperately for your sponsorship. &nbsp;Ray watches Skinemax. &nbsp;German late night television. &nbsp;The St. Pauli Girl. &nbsp;Polka music. &nbsp;The connection between polka music and mariachi music. &nbsp;
&nbsp;

Halloween costumes - Major T's. &nbsp;What pop icon or movie character will be the sexy costume of 2010?

			<title>Double D Episode 16 - Entering Flashlights and Frogs (Tim's Homebrewed Blonde Ale)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-16-entering-flashlights-and-frogs]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This episode we introduce yet another co host and yet another member of the Diaz Clan - Ray's baby brother Cardo. &nbsp;Besides the obvious physical resemblance we soon find that the two have many things in common. &nbsp;A lowbrow sense of humor is the most striking. &nbsp;Cousin Dave also sits in on this recording session.
We begin with a discussion of Cousin Dave's new haircut, which Ray describes as the "Mexican Kid 'N Play." &nbsp;This leads to talk of juvenile sexual fantasies and Barber Boobs. &nbsp;The Jesse Jane Fleshlight. &nbsp;The Oprah Oil Barrel Fleshlight. &nbsp;The perplexing Stealth fleshlight, which resembles an arcade cabinet's coin slot. &nbsp;(see album art) &nbsp;Fleshlight usage explained. &nbsp;There is NO cleaning a fleshlight after use. &nbsp;The mysterious "Naughty Boy" attachment. &nbsp;That "taint" gonna be my next purchase.
First Break Song:
&nbsp;
The Pinker Tones "Sampleame" (mp3)  from "Modular" (Nacional Records) Buy at Napster More On This Album
&nbsp;
This next section of the show is on YouTube as a video. &nbsp;Please feel free to share this on any site you want to help spread the Double D Podcast.
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
We get our historic, first time ever live call in to the show, courtesy of Robert Mesa of California. &nbsp;We discuss what we were drinking that night. &nbsp;Homebrew blonde. &nbsp;Timmy the Brewmeister. &nbsp;Jenna Jameson sidetracks the conversation. &nbsp;Top Secret! &nbsp;Robert's awesome dental assistant. &nbsp;The world's horniest dinosaur. &nbsp;The Hardonodon. &nbsp;Freedom Muffins - take that, BP!
Second Break song:
&nbsp;
Cas Haley "Take A Chance" (mp3)  from "Connection (Bonus Tracks Version)" (Easy Star Records) Buy at iTunes Music Store More On This Album
Nicotine break. &nbsp;Bev keys and twist offs. &nbsp;Unreal temperatures in Bullhead City. &nbsp;Jefe's voicemail. &nbsp;Jefe Logic. &nbsp;Lito Benally's freestyle rapped by the Double D Cast. &nbsp;Frog Rape:
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
Cousin Dave's tadpole story. &nbsp;The origin of Chimpfrogzee. &nbsp;Cardo tells a joke. &nbsp;Zen tells a "walked in on" story. &nbsp;Cousin Dave introduces the "Alabama Hot Pocket." &nbsp;If you don't know what that is, do NOT google it. &nbsp;It's grosser than gross. &nbsp;An apology to the Durans.
Outro song:
&nbsp;
The Technicolors "Fireflies" (mp3)  from "Who Are You" (Best Media) Buy at Napster More On This Album

We get our historic, first time ever live call in to the show, courtesy of Robert Mesa of California. &nbsp;We discuss what we were drinking that night. &nbsp;Homebrew blonde. &nbsp;Timmy the Brewmeister. &nbsp;Jenna Jameson sidetracks the conversation. &nbsp;Top Secret! &nbsp;Robert's awesome dental assistant. &nbsp;The world's horniest dinosaur. &nbsp;The Hardonodon. &nbsp;Freedom Muffins - take that, BP!
Second Break song:
&nbsp;
Cas Haley "Take A Chance" (mp3)  from "Connection (Bonus Tracks Version)" (Easy Star Records) Buy at iTunes Music Store More On This Album
Nicotine break. &nbsp;Bev keys and twist offs. &nbsp;Unreal temperatures in Bullhead City. &nbsp;Jefe's voicemail. &nbsp;Jefe Logic. &nbsp;Lito Benally's freestyle rapped by the Double D Cast. &nbsp;Frog Rape:
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
Cousin Dave's tadpole story. &nbsp;The origin of Chimpfrogzee. &nbsp;Cardo tells a joke. &nbsp;Zen tells a "walked in on" story. &nbsp;Cousin Dave introduces the "Alabama Hot Pocket." &nbsp;If you don't know what that is, do NOT google it. &nbsp;It's grosser than gross. &nbsp;An apology to the Durans.
Outro song:

            <description><![CDATA[
























After the coitus with a goat that was episodes 13 and 14, we try to get back to normal with this, Episode 15. &nbsp;Things start as they usually do with The Celebration of Beer.&nbsp;&nbsp;This week Ray brought a couple new microbrews, including Reaper Ale and Port Brewing's Anniversary Ale. &nbsp;The former was thick and black and oh so smooth, the latter was 10% alcohol. &nbsp;We listened to the Salty Sailor's Tale.
This show was recorded on the 22nd of September and we remind our listeners of the 21st night of September. &nbsp;Earth, Wind and Fire. &nbsp;Ray pops Zen's Snuff cherry. &nbsp;Zen relates a Redneck Chewin' Tobacco story from High School. &nbsp;What makes you an addict? &nbsp;One cigarette, one beer, one dick. &nbsp;Snuff vs. Snuff Films. &nbsp;Thanks go out to Cousin Dave and to Jefe. &nbsp;We make plans for the future. &nbsp;Double D Tuesdays. &nbsp;Zen tells a bad joke.
Magnapop takes us through the first break with Slowly, Slowly.
A little verbal sparring. &nbsp;Brass in pocket. &nbsp;What qualifies as "jackworthy" music? &nbsp;Ray's choice is an enigma full of sadness. &nbsp;Zen's choice must be listened to with the lights on.
The Pretenders take us through the second break with a live version of Message of Love.
KFC advertises on college girls' buns. &nbsp;Even though the Double Down sandwich has no buns. &nbsp;It has two breasts. &nbsp;We think the advertising should be placed somewhere else more appropriate. &nbsp;The Double Down sammich. &nbsp;Super Pooswah interrupts. &nbsp;The Earl of Sammich. &nbsp;A Call to Arms. &nbsp;Volunteers for the Techno Mexican video.

			<title>Double D Episode 14 - Drunk and Drunker Part Two (Sparks and Sapporo)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-14-drunk-and-drunker-part-two]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&nbsp;
Part Two of the marathon recording session that took place a week ago. &nbsp;Please keep in mind that this episode takes place in the middle of that nearly 6 hour session. &nbsp;At the point that this particular show begins, we had been recording ourselves for almost 3 hours. &nbsp;We had reached a point due to the time of night, the length of time already spent and the amount of alcohol consumed that we almost completely forgot we were recording at all. &nbsp;Listen carefully to the show and it will be obvious that as it goes on we do indeed get drunk and drunker. &nbsp;Most of the rambling was cut out and I hope the end product is as enjoyable to listen to as it was to put on disk. &nbsp;We had a good time and hope you will too.
The show begins with a replaying of the intro, which sounds natural, but at the time was more of a joke. &nbsp;This leads to bad singing, mainly because we were drunk. &nbsp;A simple question from Biscuit to Jefe leads to some Watersports discussion and the recommendation that Cousin Dave have his wife pee on his feet. &nbsp;Zen sees the show spiraling out of control and tries to rein it in by introducing some news stories. &nbsp;After a quick review of a San Jose Badminton coach who makes students fondle his shuttlecock, we argue over this news story in the Chicago Tribune that ranks the 10 sexiest accents in the world. &nbsp;The arguments reveal an interesting group dynamic that occurs frequently during the rest of the show. &nbsp;Jefe and Biscuit Ray tend to agree on things, while Zen and Cousin Dave tend to see eye to eye. &nbsp;Not a hard and fast rule, but usually that's how it more or less shakes out.
The consensus in the room is that the two sexiest accents are Midwestern American and Spanish. &nbsp;The Tribune does NOT agree, placing them at the bottom of the list and putting this accent at the number one spot:
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Muse takes us through the first break with a little Starlight.
We continue with a couple more news stories. &nbsp;A Swindon farmer has trouble keeping her melons on the vines so has a clever idea for supporting them with bras. &nbsp;Guess which size bra works best. &nbsp;Then a depressing story of the worlds largest breast implants being removed leads into a discussion of which kind of "guy" each of us are. &nbsp;Hint: &nbsp;two boob guys, one booty guy and one face guy. &nbsp;You probably know which is which.
Jonathan Coulton takes us through the second break with his version of Sir Mix a Lot's Baby Got Back.
Professor Van der Liquor briefly joins the cast to attempt to scientifically explain where the show went wrong. &nbsp;Zen tries to use some pictures of porn stars to cheer everyone up. &nbsp;We desperately turn to the "IF" book and play the Renaming Game. &nbsp;Some Star Wars Incest talk. &nbsp;Cousin Dave explains The Smurfs. &nbsp;Jefe reveals an embarrassing childhood secret involving the movie Good Burger. &nbsp;We argue over the Worst Movie Ever Made. &nbsp;Six Degrees of Jefe Smythe.
Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers play King of the Hill for the third break song.
We do Facebook Shout Outs and play some voicemails. &nbsp;We try to answer Destin Kerr's question. &nbsp;The Dumbest things we've ever done to impress chicks. &nbsp;Hint: &nbsp;riding a bike with no hands, Polish Arm Wrestling, racing into a fireplace and Ray's Sexy Wiener Dance.
We finish the show with two videos. &nbsp;A review of I Hate You When You're Pregnant's song Sleeveless leads into a viewing of the Internet Meme video "Techno Viking"
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
The show closes with the song Fireworks.

			<title>Double D Episode 13 - Triskaidekaphobia Part One (Brother Thelonious Abbey Ale and Tap Room 21)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double-d-episode-13-triskaidekaphobia-part-one]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Triskaidekaphobia. &nbsp;It means "fear of the number 13." &nbsp;We honestly should have had a healthy respect for triskaidekaphobia, because episode 13 turned out to be a wild ride. &nbsp;We welcomed back Cousin Dave into the studio, and he had a young'un in tow. &nbsp;Dave dragged longtime voice mail contributor Jefe into the Double D Studio to add to the mayhem. &nbsp;This new group dynamic resulted in many spectacular unforeseen results, not the least of which were: &nbsp;a Skype call that went on way too long and that expanded temporarily the cast to 8 persons, an impressive amount of alcohol being consumed and last but certainly not least a total of almost 6 hours of raw audio being recorded. &nbsp;Some of it was good, some of it was really horrible, but in the end it was more than enough to create two episodes from. &nbsp;This is Part ONE.
We began with what we were drinking that night. &nbsp;Jefe started with Thelonius Monk Abbey Ale and then moved on to Heineken. &nbsp;Cousin Dave began with Sparks alcoholic energy drink and then moved on to Tap Room 21. &nbsp;Biscuit Ray began with some leftover Fosters and then moved on to trying a little of everything else and Zen began the night with Saporro, the Japanese beer brewed in Canada. &nbsp;We all toasted the beginning of the recording with a shot of Captain Morgan's Private Stock Rum.
Topics of Discussion: &nbsp;Lady Gaga concerts. &nbsp;An Oakland A's Superfan. &nbsp;"Vag Out."
Link to the Superfan picture, so you can see what we're talking about: Click Here
&nbsp;Some sports talk. &nbsp;Bills and Beaks. &nbsp;Jefe and the Goat. &nbsp;Ray needs some Strange. &nbsp;Chicharonnes (again.)
First Break Song:
Dirt Nasty "1980" (mp3)  from "Dirt Nasty" (Shoot to Kill Music, Inc.) Buy at iTunes Music Store Buy at Amazon MP3 More On This Album
The Question of the Day. &nbsp;How much money would it really take? &nbsp;(Indecent Proposal) &nbsp;Demi Moore's shrubbery. &nbsp;Jefe recalls the underwear party. &nbsp;We pursue to the bitter end a really bad idea: &nbsp;we skype call Rocky and Laughing Girl at midnight. &nbsp;Rocky answers the Day's question. &nbsp;The transitive property of equality AKA the long way around to going down on Angie.
Second Break - Reel Big Fish
The Skype call continued. &nbsp;The Asian and the Indian. &nbsp;Racism ensues. &nbsp;The call ends abruptly. &nbsp;The Jalisco Market. &nbsp;FALA and fellatio. &nbsp;Jefe displays his leadership. &nbsp;Aborted singing of Hooked on a Feeling. &nbsp;His Face Rings a Bell. &nbsp;Scissoring is for Old People. &nbsp;A sort of voice mail from Special Ed.
End Song - Ben Folds Five
At this point in the night we had already been recording for almost 3 hours. &nbsp;I jokingly played the intro again and told the guys I would scrap all the previously recorded audio and we would just start over. &nbsp;Serendipity! &nbsp;This became a natural point to seperate the recording into two episodes, so look for Part TWO of Triskaidekaphobia next week!]]></description>

So we've reached a small milestone. &nbsp;A Dozen Down. &nbsp;While twelve may not mean a lot to other podcasts, it means something to us. &nbsp;'Cause we're Double D. &nbsp;
Anyway, this episode covers a wide range of Double D topics, from Dyson Dolls to Dudes with Down's and some Drunk Dialing. &nbsp;It all begins with what we're drinking this episode. &nbsp;Foster's. &nbsp;Australian for Beer. &nbsp;What is the constellation on Australia's flag and also the Foster's label? &nbsp;Paul Hogan's cock. &nbsp;"That's not a cock. &nbsp;That's a cock." &nbsp;Cousin Dave text-interrupts the podcast. &nbsp;Nefarious Ten Pin Imperial Porter, courtesy of Ska Brewing. &nbsp;How many ounces are in a pint? &nbsp;Cousin Dave gets Hooked on a Feelin'. &nbsp;Seth Rogen sings along with Lady Gaga. &nbsp;Video Proof:

T Shirt sales. We got 'em. Order the new "Jefe likes his Double D" T at CafePress. For every shirt sold we got a hot dollar. Support the show!
First Break Song:
&nbsp;
Suarez "Stacy" (mp3)  from "Tokyo Rose" (HOME Records) More On This Album
We start the next segment with a small description of the Nefarious Ten Pin Imperial Porter. &nbsp;It is a beer as black as the Devil's Heart, but smooth as anything you've ever drank. &nbsp;We discuss bringing back the old "Free Mustache Rides" T shirt. &nbsp;And then we launch into the great Dyson Vacuum Blowjob Doll Debate. &nbsp;Zen shares yet another embarrassing childhood story. &nbsp;This one is not so bad, fortunately. &nbsp;The Electrolux and the Bonefinger. &nbsp;Carwash vacuums and a well manicured bush.
Next Break Song:
&nbsp;
Ford "Logical" (mp3)  from "Logical" (Ford Productions, LLC) Buy at Napster More On This Album
"Super Pooswah" makes an unexpected entrance. &nbsp;The JDSI and it's incredible Down's Syndrome Ad Campaign.
Aim High or Aim High Enough. &nbsp;(note: &nbsp;since the recording of this podcast we have learned to our embarrassment that this is actually taken from a quote by John Langdon Down, the doctor for whom the condition is named. &nbsp;It has to do with "when you take aim, aim high enough" and is actually quite inspiring. &nbsp;We don't regret goofing on it, however, and will still make some sort of T shirt) &nbsp;Being "a little downy." &nbsp;Mace the Ace and My Girl.
&nbsp;
 
&nbsp;
Last Break Song:
&nbsp;
Libyans "Paralyzed" (mp3)  from "A Common Place" (Sorry State Records) Buy at Napster More On This Album
The final segment is the Voice Mail segment. &nbsp;Jefe, Rocky, Sierra Unpronouncable and Laughing Girl all check in from the underwear party. &nbsp;We argue over the best snack to have with beer and Ray proves he's not a real mexican. &nbsp;Every mexican has a bottle of hot sauce on his person at all times. &nbsp;Finally, yet another horribly racist joke from Biscuit Ray.
Closing song:

Aim High or Aim High Enough. &nbsp;(note: &nbsp;since the recording of this podcast we have learned to our embarrassment that this is actually taken from a quote by John Langdon Down, the doctor for whom the condition is named. &nbsp;It has to do with "when you take aim, aim high enough" and is actually quite inspiring. &nbsp;We don't regret goofing on it, however, and will still make some sort of T shirt) &nbsp;Being "a little downy." &nbsp;Mace the Ace and My Girl.

The final segment is the Voice Mail segment. &nbsp;Jefe, Rocky, Sierra Unpronouncable and Laughing Girl all check in from the underwear party. &nbsp;We argue over the best snack to have with beer and Ray proves he's not a real mexican. &nbsp;Every mexican has a bottle of hot sauce on his person at all times. &nbsp;Finally, yet another horribly racist joke from Biscuit Ray.

			<title>Double D Episode 11 - Bleepie Baby</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double_d_episode_11_bleepie_baby]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Where to begin . . . first off, we'd like to apologize for the week off that we took seemingly for no reason at all, and also for the smallness of this episode. &nbsp;It can all be explained away by the fact that Zen . . . well, is kinda dumb. &nbsp;Last month's shows were released in a haphazard manner and left us with no storage space on our server at the end of the month. &nbsp;We had just enough room to squeeze this smallish release in, but rest assured that this will never happen again. &nbsp;We are back on a regular recording schedule and shows will come out weekly and at their regular length starting next week.
This show is definitely worth checking out, however. &nbsp;The show, like a finely tuned podcasting racecar, goes from zero to porn in 3.6 minutes. &nbsp;What's the deal with "quickies" . . . and are men predisposed to liking quickies through years of speed masturbating? &nbsp;Of course.
Ray has a new lady friend. &nbsp;We may have mentioned her in previous episodes of The Zen and Peace Show. &nbsp;We'll have to give her a new nickname because, amazingly enough, Ray hasn't completely screwed things up (yet.) &nbsp;So for now we'll call her "Bleepie Baby" &nbsp;The reason will be clear enough once you here the show.
If you've recently become a fan on our Facebook page (located at facebook.com/doubledpodcast) then you get your shoutout during this episode. &nbsp;If you haven't joined our page and gotten your shoutout yet, head on over. &nbsp;You're only a "like button" click away.
Jefe Smythe, our most prolific caller inner, graces us with 4 more drunken voice mails. &nbsp;Tales from open auditions for American Idol and plenty of inebriated singing. &nbsp;The Hoff never sounded so good.
We'll talk at ya next week. &nbsp;If you're in the area and are going to the Coconino County Fair this weekend, keep your eyes peeled. &nbsp;Maybe we'll see you there. &nbsp;If you have anything to say about the Fair, or Fairs and Carnivals in general, give us an email or a call.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thezenandpeaceshow/Double_D_Episode_10_-_poking_Dave_Diaz.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Longtime supporter of the show Cousin Dave Diaz joins the show this week for a long anticipated episode that celebrates beer, porn and football, the three pillars of American society. &nbsp;In fact, it is only three minutes into the recording that we started talking about pornography. &nbsp;Brooke Lee Adams. &nbsp;Jesse Jane. &nbsp;Two of our favorite performers. &nbsp;Do a Google Image search.
This week we partook in some Tilt Malt Beverage Energy Drink, Happy Camper IPA, Pinstripe Red Ale, Buster Nut Brown Ale and True Blonde Ale all three from the Ska Brewing Company, Twisted Tea Half and Half and some leftover Natural Ice.
Cousin Dave listens to several podcasts besides the Double D and recommends The Bill Burr Monday Morning Podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be "Monday", not "Money" like Zen thought.
We turn our discussion to age, courtesy of Zen's upcoming 37th Birthday. &nbsp;Is age a state of mind? &nbsp;How old were each of us respectively when we first discovered that we were "the old guy" in a group of friends?
This is 'Merica. &nbsp;Its not Futbol, it's football. &nbsp;The Cincinnati Bungles. &nbsp;Why we hate the Dallas Cowboys.
Zen's Childhood Traumatic Story #1 - Marcos and the Cowboys.

Viagra Talk, as a result of a question from our friend Beantown. &nbsp;Is Viagra popular in the gay community?

More gay talk - is "poking" on facebook acceptable among heterosexual males? &nbsp;We proclaim the only 3 times when it is acceptable to poke another man.

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thezenandpeaceshow/Double_D_Episode_9_-_4D_Damn_Dos_Dudes_Doubled.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[We Double Down this episode by doubling the number of damn dudes hosting the podcast from dos to cuatro. &nbsp;Shane Dween, mentioned many times in previouse episodes, finally joins us as does another friend and co-worder who goes by the nickname C.C. Rider. &nbsp;C.C., a homebrewer and super-host, opens up his house, his fridge and many bottles of his specialty home-brewed Berry Ale for the podcast this week. &nbsp; A big shout out goes out to him for his hospitality.
While this episode is hilarious thanks to the expanded cast, there were some unexpected snafus that cropped up and kept this from being a perfect show. &nbsp;Foolishly we used a setup we had never used before and some untested equipment. &nbsp;The raw recording was almost unlistenable, it was so filled with static and buzzing. &nbsp;We cleaned it up the best we could but do apologize for having a less than perfect show to present this week. &nbsp;Give it a listen, though, because on the strength of C.C.'s Berry Ale we had one of the funnest and funniest shows yet.
Shane Dween was quizzed on his knowledge of Jimmie Johnson and Ricky Bobby quotes, C.C. was quizzed on his knowledge of Microbrews and Ray quizzed us all on what exactly constitutes gay sex. &nbsp;The Professor (see album art) settled last episodes bet on what company introduced the first light beer and when and we played a hilarious voice mail from Cousin Dave. &nbsp;How exactly are NASCAR fans like Twilight fans? &nbsp;We have a top 5 list to show you the similarities.&nbsp;
After listening to this episode we think you'll have to agree that Shane and C.C. should return sometime in the future under better recording conditions because they are truly funny dudes.
Enjoy!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[We apologize for the long&nbsp;delay in getting this episode out. &nbsp;Ray was in Northern California for a week's worth of vacation time and the very next week Zen was in Southern California. &nbsp;Go figure. &nbsp;Anyway, we start the show with details from Ray's trip, by the numbers:

5 baseball games in 6 days
400 to 500 dollars spent in beer alone
4 front row Oakland A's tickets at 60 bucks apiece
16 hot dogs
3 30 packs of Natural Ice
1,000's of drunken texts and picture messages
2 giant foam A's novelty cowboy hats (see album art)
1 hilarious voicemail

Suck the Red Fox. &nbsp;Suck the White Fox. &nbsp;A couple of shots of Parrot Bay Rum toast "Fathers and Sons, Baseball and Beer". &nbsp;Then we slide into our first break. &nbsp;Jungle Fever
This episode Ray was drinking left over Natty Ice. &nbsp;Zen was drinking Mike's Margaritas and Dos Equis. &nbsp;National Tequila Day. &nbsp;Roger Clyne's Mexican Moonshine.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is Ice Brewing? &nbsp;More NorCal stories. &nbsp;What is the Gayer Sports Apparel: &nbsp;Sharks Jersey or L.A. Galaxy Scarf? &nbsp;Tie Games in Soccer . . . tie games are like kissing your sister. &nbsp;The obnoxious Vuvuzela App on Blackberry. &nbsp;Ray hates New York sports teams. &nbsp;The office NASCAR pool and the unstoppable "Zen Jinx". &nbsp;The Max Papis Memorial Trophy. &nbsp;Our second break. &nbsp;War's Lowrider
Hot Shots Part Deux Movie quotes. &nbsp;"Not playing to win is like sleeping with your sister. &nbsp;Sure, she's a great piece of tail and a blouse full of goodies, but it's just illegal." &nbsp;Buying 20 DVDs for 20 bucks from a failing video store. &nbsp;Voicemail from Cousin Dave. &nbsp;Midgets vs. Mascots. &nbsp;Gary Coleman vs. Scotty Pippen. &nbsp;Our last break. &nbsp;Matt and Kim
Twitter! &nbsp;Follow us at twitter.com/zendehoag and twitter.com/biscuitray ! &nbsp;We also recommend following twitter.com/sarrahpalinU5A (note that it is two "r"s and a 5 instead of S in the USA)
Final song is a cover of End of the Road performed by Me First and the Gimme Gimmes.
Enjoy!]]></description>

			<title>Double D Episode 6 - Dutch Disappointment (Heineken)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double_d_episode_6_dutch_disappointment]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Double D - Depressed and Disappointed . . . mainly with the Dutch and the sudden end to their run at the FIFA World Cup title. &nbsp;We briefly mourn (or at least Zen does) their loss to the Dirty Spanish in the Final but then quickly move on to more entertaining subjects.
In Old Business, we revisit Ray's mention of Miller High Life's Bottle Caps for the Troops program. &nbsp;We finally get the details correct and hope you all will support this worthy program like we plan to. &nbsp;Hey, at the very least it's a good excuse to drink some beer. &nbsp;Speaking of beer, during the recording of this episode we were drinking Heineken, brewed with care and passion in Holland. &nbsp;And speaking of Holland, Professor Van der Liquor pays us another visit to clear up the mystery of why beer will overflow when you tap the top of a bottle with the bottom of another bottle. &nbsp;
The heart of the episode centers around Schoolyard Rhymes and Taunts. &nbsp;We really get to the origin story of our current juvenile behavior by examining the poems and songs we chanted as children that made us the man-child podcasters we are today. &nbsp;It all starts with "Milk, milk, lemonade . . ." and goes downhill from there. &nbsp;When we run out of schoolyard rhymes that we personally can recall, we go to our old friend the internet to round out the show. &nbsp;We read from The Global Schoolyard Rhyme Project located at thesneeze.com and enjoy some raunchy, offensive and just plain confusing taunts from around the world.
To close out the show we visit another Miller Lite Man Law:
 
&nbsp;
We also bid farewell to a friend and colleague, Dr. Driggs. &nbsp;Stagger Lee by Nick Cave at the end of the show is dedicated to him.
At times juvenile, wildly offensive and outright racist and sexist, this is Episode 6. &nbsp;Enjoy!

            <link><![CDATA[http://doubledpodcast.com/double_d_episode_1_dead_dudes]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&nbsp;
Welcome to the very first episode of The Double D Podcast! &nbsp;You may be wondering what Double D stands for. &nbsp;At it's most basic it stands for the hosts, Diaz and DeHoag. &nbsp;But it also means much more. &nbsp;Dos Dudes. &nbsp;Down and Dirty. &nbsp;Deliberately Dumb. &nbsp;Double Down. &nbsp;Designated Drunks. &nbsp;Drunk and Disorderly. &nbsp;Developmentally Disabled. &nbsp;You get the idea. &nbsp;The Double D podcast is a weekly gathering to enjoy some drinks, tell some jokes, reminisce and have a good time. &nbsp;Recorded every Sunday night, the Double D is a companion podcast to The Zen and Peace Show.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;In this, our inaugural episode, we lay the groundwork for what we hope will be a regular thing on the show. &nbsp;We drink a lot and fly without a map. &nbsp;Without an agenda whatsoever we find ourselves talking a lot about beer, women and sports. &nbsp;We touch on our favorite brews of all time, what makes a good beer commercial, how sports teams can break our hearts (and I am talking about you, Flyers), how we would prefer to be executed, whether bulls on the PBR circuit have names that sound TOO much like Gay Porn Movie titles and we remember a television show from the eighties that has claimed the lives of half of it's cast. &nbsp;It's episode 1 and we hope it's only the start of a wonderful thing. &nbsp;Kick back, crack open a cold one and enjoy!
&nbsp;
One last thing. &nbsp;Although this is a companion podcast and part of the same feed as The Zen and Peace Show, we do have a seperate email address for this show. &nbsp;If you'd like to write us and tell Ray that he is completely wrong about the band Journey, send it to: &nbsp;DoubleDPodcast@gmail.com
