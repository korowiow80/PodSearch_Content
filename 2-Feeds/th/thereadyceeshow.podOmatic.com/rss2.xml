      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34856/600x600_6431361.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you listen to The Ready Cee Show you represent the last part of Hiphop's living generation. It means you don't fall for the bullshit and at the same time you don't appreciate it being pushed in your face and misrepresenting the culture that you, for so many years, helped to create. 

In our continued tradition of bringing you nothing less than the most authentic flavor in existence, this week we welcome special guest, D STRONG to the lab all the way from Los Angeles.  We've been rockin a few D Strong joints in the weeks leading up to this episode to get you prepped for his appearance and now its here. D Strong recently released his newest LP, 'Rise &amp; Shoot' and he's here to let us know about his legacy and his plans for furthering Hiphop as a whole.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34856/600x600_5502608.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LEAVE A COMMENT BELOW!!!

We're taking it WAY back this week. Everyone's been waiting for DJ Ready Cee &amp; DJ Mixx to drop a soul &amp; funk classics mix for a long time and they finally got together, cracked the Maker's Mark and rewound that shit to a time before you had to know Windows to be a DJ! 

Break this mix out at your family's holiday gathering and watch as your old relatives slowly ease into the Spanky involuntarily and without even noticing. DJ Mixx sets off the first half hour and DJ Ready Cee bring it home to make a full hour of straight classics to bring the soul back to the holiday season!

This is strictly for the OGs!!

Lyrical legends Sadat X (Brand Nubian) and AG (DITC) recently rolled through the Street Vision Radio studio to chop it up with DJ Ready Cee &amp; DJ Mixx.

      <title>(CLASSIC MIXTAPE SERIES) DJ Ready Cee &amp; DJ Mixx - THE SANDHOGS (2005)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34856/600x600_5453681.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've decided to let loose a series of classic mixtapes myself and DJ Mixx have dropped throughout the time. There's so many to choose from. These CDs spread world wide but naturally saw the most light here in the streets of NYC. So to get the flavor into the hands of some who might not have been able to catch it, we're going to release a bunch of em into the netwaves for your enjoyment. 

First off is THE SANDHOGS. This is one of the first mixtapes that Me and DJ Mixx did together back in 2005. This was right after we left 91.9FM and took all of our forces into the mixtape scene so we were pretty heavy on the blocks at this time. Fat Beats record store saw these fly off the shelves every day and it even went on to catch the attention of some unmentionable eyes that caused us to rework the cover art because of some copyright issues. 

Sandhog is the slang term given to urban miners or construction workers who work underground on a variety of excavation projects in New York City. Me &amp; Mixx handle our mining and construction projects in the underground as well so it was a fitting term. 

01. Intro
02. Prodigy &amp; Illa Gee - Comatose State
03. Illa Gee - Dot The I
04. Platinum Pied Pipers feat. Jay Dee - Act Like You Know
05. Redman &amp; Busta Rhymes - Do The Damn Thing
06. Smif-N-Wesson feat. Heltah Skeltah - Timbs Do Work
07. Alkoholiks - Flute Song
08. Sheek Louch - Street Music

10. GZA &amp; DJ Muggs - Unstoppable Threats
11. Canibus &amp; Kurupt - Not 4 Play
12. MF DOOM &amp; Talib Kweli - Old School
13. Planet Asia - Medicine
14. Rah Digga feat. Chauncey Black &amp; Busta Rhymes - You Already Know
15. Ol' Dirty Bastard &amp; Busta Rhymes - Where's Your Money
16. Buckshot &amp; 9th Wonder - Slippin'
17. The Emcee (Jin) - Who's The Best?

      <title>Five Steez &amp; DJ Ready Cee - THE MOMENTUM Vol. 2</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34856/600x600_5181772.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KINGSTON, JAMAICA &#8211; Rising Hip Hop artiste, Five Steez, and New York City radio icon, DJ Ready Cee, have released the highly anticipated &#8216;Momentum: Volume Two&#8217; mixtape for free download and streaming at http://www.djreadycee.com &amp; iTunes. The 35-minute mix by DJ Ready Cee is also available as a single-track and as 17 separate tracks at the Five Steez Facebook Fan Page (http://www.facebook.com/fivesteez).

&#8216;Volume One&#8217; in the three-part series, released December 2010, clocked tens of thousands of downloads within months of its release.

&#8220;I took it back to the &#8216;golden era&#8217; with the choice of instrumentals on the last one and now we&#8217;ve moved up in time. It&#8217;s the same concept but the energy is crazier plus there are new flows and new styles. I had to top the first one with this. That&#8217;s the whole idea of building momentum,&#8221; says the young Kingston-based rapper.

Despite widespread local and international awareness of an emerging Hip Hop scene in the land of Reggae, Five Steez has captured the attention of numerous tastemakers in Hip Hop including the legendary DJ Ready Cee.

&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you, whoever felt Volume One is gonna love Volume Two. It&#8217;s exactly the same vibe and sounds like a perfect continuation. I know it took a long while but I just had to wait for the right time,&#8221; says DJ Ready Cee.

      <itunes:summary>KINGSTON, JAMAICA &#8211; Rising Hip Hop artiste, Five Steez, and New York City radio icon, DJ Ready Cee, have released the highly anticipated &#8216;Momentum: Volume Two&#8217; mixtape for free download and streaming at http://www.djreadycee.com &amp; iTunes. The 35-minute mix by DJ Ready Cee is also available as a single-track and as 17 separate tracks at the Five Steez Facebook Fan Page (http://www.facebook.com/fivesteez).

&#8216;Volume One&#8217; in the three-part series, released December 2010, clocked tens of thousands of downloads within months of its release.

&#8220;I took it back to the &#8216;golden era&#8217; with the choice of instrumentals on the last one and now we&#8217;ve moved up in time. It&#8217;s the same concept but the energy is crazier plus there are new flows and new styles. I had to top the first one with this. That&#8217;s the whole idea of building momentum,&#8221; says the young Kingston-based rapper.

Despite widespread local and international awareness of an emerging Hip Hop scene in the land of Reggae, Five Steez has captured the attention of numerous tastemakers in Hip Hop including the legendary DJ Ready Cee.

&#8220;I&#8217;m telling you, whoever felt Volume One is gonna love Volume Two. It&#8217;s exactly the same vibe and sounds like a perfect continuation. I know it took a long while but I just had to wait for the right time,&#8221; says DJ Ready Cee.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34856/600x600_5056366.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We come from a generation of Hiphop that stood strong for itself and wasn't weighted down by the forces of greed and genocide. The rules we set in place for the new form of communication we created have been turned against us and are being used to dissolve the very foundation that gave it birth.

They're meticulously dividing us into very separate groups who don't agree with one anothers ways and soon we'll be involved in a highly orchestrated civil war that will eventually destroy every drip of soul that ever existed.

That's why programs like THE READY CEE SHOW are so important, because it represents the true COUNTER CULTURE that Hiphop is. Its not a puppet being controlled by the interests of screaming teenage girls or wide-eyed envious dudes with no flavor. Its one of the last remaining SOURCES of raw energy that keeps Hiphop powered and alive. 

This week, DJ Mixx sets off the journey with a fiercely blended mix of classic bangers to heat your soul to an appropriate temperature to handle the raw BRAND NEW joints that DJ Ready Cee spins for the second half of the show!

Keep spreading these links around to every corner of the internet and help infect the ears of these zombies out here and try to bring em back to life!

      <title>DJ READY CEE &amp; DJ MIXX present: JUSTO'S REVOLUTION PT. 2 (Hosted by Pete Rock &amp; Marley Marl)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34856/600x600_1679900.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixtapes come a dime a dozen in today's world of MP3s and computerized DJing. Thousands of DJs were born out of nowhere with the emergence of new technology and spawned a rash of low brow releases that have flooded the streets from coast to coast.

JUSTO'S REVOLUTION PT. 2 represents what makes a mixtape stand out above the crowd. It represents a true collaborative effort between some of Hiphop's legends and it's emerging forces. Artists like Pete Rock, DJ Premier and Black Sheep have come together with DJ Ready Cee &amp; DJ Mixx to honor a man who meant so much to the world of mixtape DJing, Justo Faison. We called on some of our most powerful allies in the world of Hiphop to contribute to this project and everyone we needed stepped up in a big way to make this happen.

JUSTO'S REVOLUTION PT. 2 reaches far beyond the expectations of a normal mixtape and brings heavyweights back to the roots of the game!

      <title>DJ Ready Cee &amp; Five Steez - THE MOMENTUM Vol. 1</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/34856/600x600_3717531.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kingston, Jamaica: LOCAL RAPPER RELEASES MIXTAPE WITH HIP HOP ICON

In 1967, Jamaican-born DJ Kool Herc took the local sound system culture to the Bronx, New York and subsequently, Hip Hop was born. Four decades later, the genre has come full circle as Five Steez, one of Jamaica&#8217;s Hip Hop MCs, has collaborated with DJ Ready Cee, a New York underground Hip Hop radio icon from the Bronx, and released a mixtape online entitled &#8216;The Momentum: Volume One&#8217;.  

The mixtape, which is the first release in a three part series, features 18 tracks, spanning a total of 46 minutes, in which Five Steez spits his lyrics over well-known instrumentals as DJ Ready Cee employs his tricks in mixing, cutting and scratching. It is available for download at www.djreadycee.com, www.facebook.com/fivesteez &amp; iTunes.

&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve heard a &#8216;real mixtape&#8217; with actual mixing, plus scratching, and I wanted to bring that back,&#8221; says the rapper. &#8220;It&#8217;s become rare even within modern Hip Hop but this is what the mixtape is really about.&#8221;

DJ Ready Cee, known for The Underground Lockdown and The Ready Cee Show on New York City&#8217;s WHUT 91.9FM during the late 1990s and early 2000s, says, &#8220;I first heard the homie Five Steez when he sent me a track that I played on my online show. I was blown away and so were my co-hosts and listeners because it was so dope. And this kid is coming straight out of Kingston, Jamaica, so that was special.&#8221;

Five Steez says, &#8220;Ready Cee is an icon so it&#8217;s definitely an honour to get this type of support from him, particularly with the mixtape. I hope that this will highlight turntablism locally and also build my fanbase, especially abroad where the real market for Hip Hop exists.&#8221;

Five Steez is one of the most recognized artists within Kingston&#8217;s growing Hip Hop movement and is best known for his appearance in the music video, &#8216;Get Down&#8217;, and recent performances at Manifesto|Jamaica events, ART&#8217;ical Exposure and ART&#8217;ical Empowerment Live. He can be found at www.twitter.com/fivesteez (@FiveSteez) and www.facebook.com/fivesteez </description>
