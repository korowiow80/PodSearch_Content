		<itunes:summary>New game genres come around more often than we seem to think. The most recent trend in board gaming is the deck building game - popularized by Dominion. These game design &quot;revolutions&quot; often lead to evolutionary games - like Quarriors - that twist the basic premise to give it a different appeal. In this podcast Jessica, Skaff, and Richard discuss this branch of game design as well as hand building games, bag building games, and chamber maids(?) And as a special treat, Richard gets us started with a little diddy.

		<itunes:summary>Identify!
You are a Shadow, a creature of the night, or a Hunter, a human whose job is to destroy supernatural creatures, or a civilian, a normal human just caught in the middle of this ancient battle. But your identity remains secret until someone outs you through your actions and through Hermit cards or you reveal yourself to use your special ability. The key to victory is to identify your allies and enemies early.

Survival!
Once your identity is revealed, your enemies will attack without impunity using their special abilities like Demolish, Teleport, and Suck Blood or equipment cards such as the Rusty Broad Ax or Fortune Brooch. This ancient battle comes to a head and only one group will stand victorious – or a civilian, in the right circumstances, might claim victory.

		<itunes:summary>Catacombs is an action/dexterity based adventure board game. One player controls the Overseer, controlling the monsters of the catacombs. The other player(s) control the four heroes who cooperatively try to defeat the monsters and eventually the Catacomb Lord.  Each of the heroes have special abilities that must also be used effectively if they are to prevail.

The main mechanic of Catacombs is for the players to flick wooden discs representing the monsters and the heroes. Contact with an opposing piece inflicts damage but missiles, spells, and other special abilities can cause other effects. When all of the monsters of a room have been cleared, the heroes can move further into the catacomb.   Items and equipment upgrades can be purchased from the Merchant with gold taken from fallen monsters.  The Catacomb Lord is the final danger that the heroes must defeat to win the game. Conversely, the Overseer wins if all of the heroes are defeated.  The game is designed for quick setup and fast play.

Each player builds a civilization based on various technologies, ideas, and cultural advancements, all represented by cards. Each of these cards has a unique power which will allow further advancement, point scoring, or even attacking other civilizations. Be careful though, as other civilizations may be able to benefit from your ideas as well!

To win, you must score achievements, which you can attain by amassing points or by meeting certain criteria with the innovations you have built. Plan your civilization well, and outmaneuver your opponents, and with some luck you will achieve victory!

In Magical Athlete, first you draft a team of runners. Then you race them. Each creature can only run in one race. Each creature also has a unique power - so no two races are the same! The player with the most points after all the races are done wins.

Then, that player says aloud a sentence or a word connected to his or her picture.  Every other player then selects a picture from his or her own hand that most closely matches.  All players then place their cards, face down, in the center.  The cards are shuffled then revealed to all.  Players finally have to choose whose card they think is the storyteller&#039;s!

		<itunes:summary>Listen in on game designers Tyler Bielman, Skaff Elias and Richard Garfield as they talk about the many differences between games that have the same setup every time (like chess) versus games where the setup changes vastly from game to game (like Magic: The Gathering). But how do “meta-rules” develop for games with this much difference from session to session? And what about Tiger Woods playing miniature golf? Tune in for answers to these questions as the second Games with Garfield podcast rolls out.

		<itunes:summary>The first Games with Garfield podcast is like your first glass of scotch; a little rough at first but then it smoothes out and eventually you just can’t get enough. A touch of tabletop industry news is followed by a rousing discussion of Dungeons &amp; Dragons as a cooperative game. The conversation evolves into a detailed examination of cooperative games. Join game designers Tyler Bielman, Skaff Elias and Richard Garfield as they dig into concepts like time pressure, team dynamics and the always enigmatic “fuzz-o-rama” communication rules.
