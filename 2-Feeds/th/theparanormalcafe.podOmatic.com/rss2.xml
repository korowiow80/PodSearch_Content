What are codes? What about the 30th year anniversary with &quot;Return to Rendlesham&quot; Conference.
Here Rob asks them about their return to the forest that is burned into their minds for eternity. This case has stood the test of time and still consistantly debated. Rob also asks about the new information in regards to the &quot;Codes&quot;. Listen to Jim talk about the codes, and the evolution of the investigation into them.
Host notes: I am glad these guys agreed to come onto the show and discuss further the case. This is one for the ages. Thank you Jim and John, you are most welcome here.

      <title>Hear the Rob Simcox interview as a guest on The Gut N Bone Show!</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_3822699.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here's a change of pace for you. Robert is invited on The Gut N Bone Show, www.gutwrench.podomatic.com for a live interview. The host Robby Bradbury asks Rob a wide range of questions and you may not be ready for the answers you hear. These are things that Rob doesn't talk about all the time on the radio. Rob gets into the origin of the show and the basis of himself and the show in this interview. Listen for Rob talk about his influence, his Mother, and how that helped shape his curiosity and longing for more.
Host Notes: This was a very cool interview with Robby. I thank him for inviting me to share his broadcast time. He is a stand up host and I appreciate the host banter that only hosts can have, give and take. I am heavily honored by Robby when his introduction states that I was an influence on him. Wow! I thank him very much and hope I can continue to do so. I hope you enjoy me being on the other side of the microphone. Let me know what you think, email me at cafe@juno.com

Brad discusses the show with Rob and they go into detail on the team assembled for the series. Brad shares some behind the scene details from the show as well. Brad discusses his personal views on the premier episode and discuss details important to the missing cornerstones of The White House, and The Capital.
Host Notes: I want to thank Brad for his insights and his time in The Cafe. He shares some personal stories about his parents and his family that I find very endearing. Brad is very meticulous on his work and it shows in his frank discussions. I think The History Channel has &quot;Raised The Bar&quot; in producing this series and I can't get enough of it. It comes out swinging and keeps swinging until the final moments of the show. If you like a good mystery that delivers on substance, then Brad Meltzer's DECODED is the series for you.

      <title>Leslie Kean visits The Paranormal Cafe to discuss her new book, UFOs- Generals,Pilots,And Government Officials Go On The Record.</title>

Rob asks questions about some of the more well known cases, Rendlesham Forest. Leslie talks about some of the lesser known cases profiled in the book. She thanks her contributors and talks about the differences between the US Government versus foriegn govenments handling of UFO cases. 
Host Notes: There are but a few of &quot;Must Haves&quot; when it comes to books dealing of this subject. UFOs - Generals,Pilots, And Government Officials Go On The Record. is certainly one of these. If you were to only get one book this year, I would have to recommend this one. It is a masterpiece that flies in the face of &quot;If only someone with credibility would come forward about their UFO sigtings and go on the record&quot; Well it seems so many have and you have them all in one place. I am so happy for Leslie and her book being on The New York Times Bestsellers List. She has earned her respect and will have mine eternally.

      <title>The Colonel Charles Halt Tape Recording made at Rendlesham 12.26.1980. MP3</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_3389203.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the recording made by Colonel Charles Halt at Rendlesham the morning of December 26th 1980. This is the complete recording that was made by him and has been discussed at great lengths in ufo and non ufo circles. Listen to the unedited tape for yourself and hear in detail Col. Halt's own words, while it's happenning. 
I have posted this because of the many emails I received asking for the complete tape. Please note: Listen for around 2:22 where you here a bar or two of piano music. This is where Col. Halt discussed on The Paranormal Cafe that he had accidentally moved the switch on the recorder to record, while the tape was in and inadvertantly recorded about a second of his daughter's recital. A tid bit I find interesting.

      <itunes:summary>Here is the recording made by Colonel Charles Halt at Rendlesham the morning of December 26th 1980. This is the complete recording that was made by him and has been discussed at great lengths in ufo and non ufo circles. Listen to the unedited tape for yourself and hear in detail Col. Halt's own words, while it's happenning. 
I have posted this because of the many emails I received asking for the complete tape. Please note: Listen for around 2:22 where you here a bar or two of piano music. This is where Col. Halt discussed on The Paranormal Cafe that he had accidentally moved the switch on the recorder to record, while the tape was in and inadvertantly recorded about a second of his daughter's recital. A tid bit I find interesting.

      <title>The Paranormal Cafe interviews Col. Charles Halt and Mr. John Burroughs. 7-30-10 Pt. 2</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_3288744.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the conclusion of the interview. Description of show as follows.

Here are two of the pivotal witnesses in the incident at RAF Bentwaters. Col. Halt was investigating the landing site of the UFO and was using his personal recorder to document the site. While recording him and his team then witnessed their own UFO's and documented them as well. His recording has become legendary in the UFO field and I find him an unwilling participant in all this. John Burroughs was the only witness to be present at BOTH the first nights incident with James Penniston, and the second night with Halt. Rob interviews Col. Halt and Mr. Burroughs about their incidents and delves into the tape itself. This is an interview that is a must hear for anyone interested in the Bentwaters UFO incidents. Host Notes: Listen for Col. Halt discuss the back story of how the story got out. You can hear his distain for some of those involved and his honesty in his thoughts and actions. I was surprised at his candor and his willingness to discuss this case with me. I also liked Mr. Burroughs reactions to all the incident and think I can identify with what was going on in his head and what he was trying to accomplish by voluntarily going out into Rendlesham on the second night. I find the Gentlemen to be stand up individuals that have had to deal with a horrible situation that they had no choice but to deal with. Listen to their story in their own words and then ask yourself, &quot;Would I have acted the same?&quot; Please note that this interview was performed less than 2 weeks prior to the BBC &quot;Hit Piece&quot; by Evan Davis. I thank both of these Gentlemen for coming on and invite them back anytime to discuss whatever they would wish. I hope you enjoy the discussions and invite you to listen to all of our podcasts at www.theparanormalcafe.podomatic.com Listen to the shows live broadcast on WCHE 1520AM on Fridays 6 pm.

      <title>Interview with Mr. James Penniston &amp; Mr. John Burroughs in response to BBC Hit Piece on Bentwaters.</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_3268791.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we interview recent guests on The Paranormal Cafe, James Penniston and John Burroughs regarding the recent BBC Article by Evan Davis (unreachable), &quot;The Truth Is Not Out There&quot; with contributions by Ian Ridpath (invited, declined)and Mark Pilkington (invited,declined).
Rob reads the article and allows both gentlemen to respond to the obvious &quot;Hit Piece&quot; from the BBC. They discuss this recent attack and talk about the obvious flaws in the &quot;Investigation&quot; by Davis. Rob chimes in with what his thoughts on it is and invites you to come to your own conclusion.
Host Notes: I'm glad I was able to get these gentlemen on the show so quickly and thank them for their candor. I really found the piece by Mr. Davis ridiculous and think most others will too. I really wanted to allow these gentlemen their time to address the article in their own words and say what was on their mind. Thank you Mr. Penniston and Mr. Burroughs very much. Your always welcome.

      <title>The Paranormal Cafe Welcomes Mr. James Penniston. Eyewitness to Bentwaters UFO Incident.</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_3018606.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We gladly welcome Mr. Penniston to the Cafe. Rob interviews Jim about his first hand account of his experiences at RAF Bentwaters, on December 26th 1980. Jim came up close and too close for comfort with his investigation into what he describes as a ship that landed in Rendlesham Forest. Listen to Jim in his own words tell what happened that fateful night. This incident changed Jim and has never left him since. Would you have acted as he did? Would your life change forever if you were in Rendlesham Forest that night? Listen and wonder for yourself.
Host notes: When I host this show I have many different experiences talking with guests. Some interviews go well, some not so much. When I started this show 5 years ago I had my &quot;Bucket list&quot; of guests I would like to interview. Jim was at the top of the list. I have been looking forward to it for several years now. The interview went better than could be expected. Jim is a gentleman who brings a lot of class, and an honest talk to the listener and myself that really sews up why I ever wanted to do this in the first place. I wanted the listener to hear for themselves straight from those who had experienced it. Unfiltered. That's what you get here. Jim tells it as he saw it and lets you make up your own mind. Refreshing. Thank you Mr. Penniston, it is greatly appreciated.
I hope you enjoy the show and invite you to listen to all of our podcasts at www.theparanormalcafe.podomatic.com Listen to the shows live broadcast on WCHE 1520AM now on Fridays 6 pm.

      <title>The Paranormal Cafe interview with International UFO Investigator Richard Dolan. 12.01.09</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_2932315.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the interview with Richard Dolan www.keyholepublishing.com about his latest, and highly anticipated book, The Cover-Up Exposed, 1973-1991. This is the second book in a trilogy where the first book, UFOs and the National Security State: An Unclassified History, 1941-1973 was one for the ages. I have read his first book and am very much looking forward to the second. We have Jennifer Stein www.mainlinemufon.com calling in to talk about Richard's work as well.
A little on Richard,
Richard Dolan was born in Brooklyn, New York, studied at Alfred University and Oxford University, was a finalist for a Rhodes scholarship, and completed his graduate work in history at the University of Rochester. Prior to his interest in UFOs, Dolan studied U.S. Cold War strategy, Soviet history and culture, and international diplomacy. 

In 2000, he published UFOs and the National Security State: An Unclassified History, 1941-1973 (republished in 2002 with the subtitle Chronology of a Cover-Up, 1941-1973). This 500-page history provides clear detail on the major UFO cases of the early Cold War era, the attitudes and policies toward UFOs by the military and intelligence community, and the fascinating development of the citizen movements to end UFO secrecy. 

In 2009, Richard completed Volume Two of his historical study, subtitled The Cover-Up Exposed, 1973-1991, and is now at work on the final volume of his historical trilogy.

      <title>The Paranormal Cafe interviews Author Bobby McGehee! April 27th 2010.</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_2923373.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we interview Author Bobby McGehee bnmcgehee@juno.com about his new book Model Of The Universe. http://newuniversetheory.com/ In this interview Rob talks with Mr. McGehee about his findings that The Big Bang theory, is just that, A Theory. Mr. McGehee puts forth that this is NOT consistant with the data and his books shows this to be the case. Rob brings up current theories (Dr. Alan Guth's Inflation Theory)about the universe and the problems with them. Hear why the Big Bang was not even a small pop!
Host Notes: I like what Bobby is saying here. He is unafraid to be challenged and even encourages us to think for ourselves. I've always had nagging doubts about the Big Bang and, until now, I thought I was alone. Listen to Bobby and his findings and get over to buy his book at http://www.authorhouse.com look up McGehee and you will find his books available. Thank you Mr. McGehee for your time and I wish you all the luck in the galaxies!

      <title>Cafe Broadcast on 07.31.09 Interview w/ Bradley Lockerman on his new movie The John Searl Story.</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_2047458.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been getting enormous responses to this show to get it on as soon as possible and here it is.
In this broadcast Rob interviews Bradley Lockerman, Writer and Director of the new movie- The John Searl Story. www.johnsearlstory.com
Bradley comes to the Cafe asking us only one thing. Is it possible to have the solution to the energy crisis and anti-gravidic flight all in one solution? Bradley invites you to see for yourself. Rob interviews him about his movie and they go into detail about the life of Mr. John Searl.
Host notes: I have watched many movies about unexplained phenomenon, this is by far the very best! Bradley takes you to meet the man and learn from him, in his own words, his invention!
I like what Bradley has done here. He has invited you to make up your own mind and research for yourself. He does not lead you to a predetermined conclusion, but to come up with your own. He let the movie, be John Searl. I highly recommend this movie for everyone to watch. It is a movie that I believe children can watch as well as adults. It will encourage children to look inside at their own creativity as well as invite adults to find thiers.
Every so often we are given a glimpse as to what may be, and it is up to us to find what is.
Go on Facebook and search out &quot;The John Searl Story&quot; and you can join the facebook group for the movie itself.
I hope you enjoy the show and invite you to listen to all of our podcasts at www.theparanormalcafe.podomatic.com Listen to the shows live broadcast on WCHE 1520AM on Fridays from 5 to 8 pm. Eastern US time, and online stream at www.wche1520.com

      <itunes:summary>We have been getting enormous responses to this show to get it on as soon as possible and here it is.
In this broadcast Rob interviews Bradley Lockerman, Writer and Director of the new movie- The John Searl Story. www.johnsearlstory.com
Bradley comes to the Cafe asking us only one thing. Is it possible to have the solution to the energy crisis and anti-gravidic flight all in one solution? Bradley invites you to see for yourself. Rob interviews him about his movie and they go into detail about the life of Mr. John Searl.
Host notes: I have watched many movies about unexplained phenomenon, this is by far the very best! Bradley takes you to meet the man and learn from him, in his own words, his invention!
I like what Bradley has done here. He has invited you to make up your own mind and research for yourself. He does not lead you to a predetermined conclusion, but to come up with your own. He let the movie, be John Searl. I highly recommend this movie for everyone to watch. It is a movie that I believe children can watch as well as adults. It will encourage children to look inside at their own creativity as well as invite adults to find thiers.
Every so often we are given a glimpse as to what may be, and it is up to us to find what is.
Go on Facebook and search out &quot;The John Searl Story&quot; and you can join the facebook group for the movie itself.
I hope you enjoy the show and invite you to listen to all of our podcasts at www.theparanormalcafe.podomatic.com Listen to the shows live broadcast on WCHE 1520AM on Fridays from 5 to 8 pm. Eastern US time, and online stream at www.wche1520.com

Karyn and Richard come to us on the eve of the publishing of Richard's new book UFOs and the National Security State. Volume Two.

Karyn and Richard come to us on the eve of the publishing of Richard's new book UFOs and the National Security State. Volume Two. Richard's first volume is by far a must-read and is a benchmark in UFO publications. Volume Two promises to be even better. Coving the cover-up from 1973-1991. Rob interviews them here in a snapshot before their appearences in Roswell this year. Karyn Dolan hosts the internet radio program &quot;Through the Keyhole&quot; Fridays, 8-10* pm EST

 Please feel free to attend both of their presentations in Roswell, July 2nd-5th. Let them know you heard them on The Paranormal Cafe. 
Host Notes: I appreciate Karyn and Richard coming on the show and sharing their upcoming talks with us. I really like having them both on because of the chemistry between them and the subject matter. I wanted to have them on longer and they have both agreed to be on after the publication of the new book. I am looking forward to it very much. Thank you very much Karyn and Richard.

      <title>The Paranormal Cafe broadcast 05.08.09 pt. 3 Interview w/ Alexandra Holzer</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_1917355.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Paranormal Cafe welcomes Author, Columnist, and Paranormalist, Alexandra Holzer to the airwaves. www.hauntingholzer.com

Alexandra Holzer is a member of organizations such as the SCBWI, Firstwriters.com, IMDBpro.com and Absolute Writers.com. Her father is the original ghost hunter, published Author Professor Hans Holzer, Ph.D of 146 titles in the genres of parapsychology, the supernatural, religion and healing and some fiction. He is most known for the adaptation of his book 'Murder in Amityville' for the film Amityville II: The Possession, Ghosts, America's Haunted House, The UFOnauts, The Journey of the Magi and Murder in Amityville: Fact or Fiction-a compilation of all three books he had written on the case. 

Holzer was recently inducted into Marquis Who's Who in America 2008 62nd Edition, following her father from the 70s. Her first title (Lady Ambrosia-Secret Past Revealed) had two field nomination's, one with Young Adult Literature by the ALA and another to the IHG (International Horror Guild.) 

Her mother is an accomplished artist, Countess on the Baron side to the Russian Buxhoeveden Family with relations to Catherine The Great. Their published family book is written in German entitled, 'Riga 1201 Buxhoeveden 2001.' Holzer's 98 year old Parisian grandmother, Rosine Claire (married to the count of Russia), has herself published 'French Gourmet Vegetarian', 'New French Gourmet Vegetarian' and 'French Vegetarian Cosmetics.' 

She studied at some of the best prep schools in New York City, including 'The Lycee Francais', 'The Fleming School' and 'The York Preparatory School.' In 1992, after graduating high school, she attended 'The Fashion Institute of Technology'(F.I.T), earning two degrees in Fine Arts and Advertising. Her mother also attended F.I.T. when Alexandra was a teen. It was here where Holzer became a self taught Graphic Designer working for small to big travel ad agencies. In 1999, she quit her job as a graphic designer for a conference publishing company and bravely left to begin her own freelance business naming it AHG Design. 

Alexandra Holzer's second book, 'Growing Up Haunted-A Ghostly Memoir' alongside her fathers newest title, 'Spirit Connection-How The Other Side Intervenes', have published as father and daughter for the first time under the same house. A rare haunting moment. 'Growing Up Haunted' is being read by a documentary filmmaker generating vast interest in it's story. She already knows who she would want to play her father. 

In the interim of the new book, Holzer had created her monthly column named 'Spirit Talk' for the Paranormal Awareness Society based in Florida who has a radio show and since then was picked up from UFO Digest.com based in Canada and at www.alienseekernews.com from the mid-west. 

While filming for New Wave Entertainment Production Company in April of '07 for the re-release of the film Poltergeist, she went on with her father as paranormal experts and authors released October 2007.

Host notes: I wish Alexandra well with her recent passing of her Father. I enjoyed having Alexandra on, and wanted to focus more on her own work and perspectives in the field. She did well on the show and I think has established herself well. Best wishes Alexandra.

Thanks Mom.

      <title>Conclusion of Dennis Hope's interview from The Lunar Embassy on The Paranormal Cafe March 20th 2009 Pt 3 of 4 </title>

Rob goes into some details about politicians and money. The World Monetary Fund is discussed along with how The Delta could benefit everyone. 
Host notes: I find it very interesting how Dennis discusses the moon and how it's very existence will benefit mankind. I think that NASA has dropped, and punted the ball when it comes to the moon. We have a natural resource that is completely untapped and has not been used for anything except propaganda. We as the human race must utilize the moon in order for us to have any hope of reaching the next level in our existence. Is the moon the next Middle East in resources?

Rob's guests are Steve Pitner chezwold@juno.com, Barbara Selletti bselletti@gmail.com, Tony Selletti Sr. tony@aparanormalhistory.com, along with Anthony Selletti Jr. 
We discuss Barbara's continuing research on her books. That's correct she's working on several books as we speak. She explains why and how she is asking for the listeners help with this. She is asking those who research the paranormal, exactly why they became involved with this thankless effort in the first place. Barbara explains more in the podcast.

      <title>Interview w/ Peter Lemesurier about Nostradamus and his Prophecies. 01-12-07 2nd hour.</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_1412024.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the second hour of 01-12-07 where Rob interviews Peter Lemesurier regarding his extensive work on Nostradamus and his Prophecies. Visit his website at www.notradamus500.com
Peter explains his research and his conclusions and invites the listener to do the same. With over 500 years since Nostradamus's death, he still remains as an icon and an enigma for us today.
Host Notes: I like this interview first because it was done in the WCHE studios. Secondly because of Peter's attitude towards the subject. He invites you to make up your own mind and research for yourself. It is a refreshing interview and I wish to thank him for coming on the show (even through a scheduling error) and speaking with us. Let him know you heard the interview and what you thought.

      <title>Time Traveler - John Titor! Interview with Oliver Williams Part 2</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_2794471.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the second part of the interview with Oliver Williams about his website. www.johntitor.com 
It's all about the famed time traveller John Titor! John is a self-proclaimed time traveller who stopped in our time in 2001 enroute to 2036. His travels take him from 2036 to 1975 to pursue a IBM 5100 computer, of all things. Oliver discusses why and his involvement and brings us up to speed with the case of John Titor.

      <title>11-30-06 Alex Jones visits The Paranormal Cafe.</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1150335/600x600_1234736.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our guest on The Paranormal Cafe is the one and only Alex Jones. He comes on the show being shot out of a cannon. Alex covers the current conspiracy of 9-11 and outlines how he &quot;Called The Shot&quot; Alex's site www.infowars.com
Alex's facts are many and he gives MANY sites to visit for you to verify. 
Host Notes- I love having Alex on the show. He is an &quot;In Your Face&quot; type of reporter. Alex brings energy and, to my amazement, WANTS people to Pirate his material. Alex invites you to make up your own mind and do so before it is too late. Thank you Mr. Jones for the time you spent here at The Paranormal Cafe.
