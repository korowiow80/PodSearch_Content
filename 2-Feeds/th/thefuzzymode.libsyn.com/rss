			<title>On Psychosynthesis and Reality Tunnels.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thefuzzymode.libsyn.com/on-psychosynthesis-and-reality-tunnels-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Well then....I've been paying for this space on a continuum so I figure I might as well use it yeah? (yup!) <br/><br/>Anyhow, I am now officially done with my junior year @ Humboldt State University and have also been officially placed @ Humboldt County Mental Health for my senior year. I have (as you already know if you know me!) been doing hours there for a little less then 2 years on a volunteer basis and that's been really great. Now its official soooooooooo....we'll see how I fare there now! <br/><br/>In addition to learning massive amounts of theory, concepts, and getting better chops for future helping positions, I have also been doing massive amounts of self-care and learning about Psychosynthesis is one such way. <br/><br/>Will Parfitt calls it, &quot;Practical Esoteric Psychology.&quot;<br/><br/>Roberto Assagioli (the fella that brought it to fruition in the first place!) calls it, &quot;A psychology with a soul.&quot; <br/>I call it golden thus far!....and have been really loving the books that I have regarding this new (to me anyhow!) way of making better sense of myself (or rather, my &quot;I.&quot;) and of the world that exists within what Leary and Wilson have defined as my, &quot;reality tunnel!&quot;<br/><br/>Truth be told, Assagioli has based his brand of psychology on the
Kabala and used the 10 Sephira as his template for his, &quot;Egg of
Consciousness,&quot; so, in addition to teaching myself a bit about his mind game I am also taking crash courses in Jewish Mysticism ......Cool! (;o)<br/>
<br/><br/>I will be posting much more about what I am learning here in the near future but just wanted to start the process of blogging once again during these summer months and between my time in class. I also plan to do some podcasts but we'll just have to see about that one later!<br/><br/>O.k. then.....now I've begun so no more excuses!<br/>(Woot!..........Woooot!)<br/>I will make an attempt to come here often and begin the process of throw'in up my words for all to see. Hope I won't regret it! (hee hee hee.)<br/><br/>In the meantime....Please enjoy (hate? (;o) a new soundscape that I have been working on lately entitled, &quot;From Berlin.&quot; <br/><br/>Lat'zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.<br/>~JohnnyKat<br/> ]]></description>

(;o) ...and will continue to listen to everyone's requests, woes, and wants for future shows. The following is a playlist. Thanks for asking Hell Kiss! (Addicted to Fiction.) Lat'z! ~Fuzzy

/////// 5th show playlist:

 100 Flowers - Salad of Speech,
 My Bloody Valentine - Thorn,
 Gun Club - Sex Beat,

 Faust - the Sad Skinhead,
 RIOU - 06,
 Cranialrectosis - Vagitarian,

 The Controllers - Jezebel,
 Richard Hell - Love Comes In Spurts,
 Plamo - Chime Organ,

            <link><![CDATA[http://thefuzzymode.libsyn.com/fuzzymodeshow-number-4-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Hey all!
O.k.....>Without further ado, it's the new fuzzymode show up for grabs!

This one is dedicated to my father. He passed a couple of weeks back. He was a pro-boxer during one period of his life so I included International Males version of, "Eye of the Tiger," in addition to dedicating the whole shaaah-bangggg to him. 
(Thanks for shooting that out to me Diggy!....you're the best'estttt!...and p.s.: You know I'm just joking about you all smelling of cheese...right? right!) 

My fathers death has been pretty hard but 
one cool thing that came out of all of it was  that I got back in touch with my sis...and vice versa....and that's a super duper, cool thing indeed!

I hope that y'all like the show and as always, shoot me emails and make the calls to let me know what you think of "the messssssss."

Lat'z.

			<title>Humble apologies everyone.</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thefuzzymode.libsyn.com/humble-apologies-everyone-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[My humblest of apologies to each and every one of you. I recieved a phone call about a week and a half ago from both my sister and mother letting me know that my father passed. As consequence, I haven't done my "casts" for two weeks now. I do plan to continue with my shows...they are on hiatus because my head just isn't "there" at the moment. Please be patient with me and I promise to start back up in the coming weeks. Until then...................Stay tuned.
