We didn’t really discuss anything that you could do or give you steps to follow to get you started.<br /><br />Let’s change that and give you a few ideas on how to start on the journey to becoming even better project managers. So in this interview Susanne takes us through step 2 in the book, which is the self-assessment.<br /><br />We begin with discussing the importance of knowing what your current capabilities are (strengths and weaknesses) and how the process assists you in assessing this through the extensive self assessments (10 categories - 80 dimensions). This helps the project manager pinpoint where they need to focus their attention in order to succeed. Then we review 3 of the 10 categories that need to be assessed and close with a discussion about the importance of feedback - both in the context of providing effective feedback to team members in order to grow others and create highly motivated team members and receiving feedback from peers and managers in order to progress your own capabilities and career.</p>

Yes? Did you know that it takes just six steps to reach your Project Management and leadership goals! All you need is to follow the advice that Susanne Madsen (http://www.susannemadsen.co.uk) outlines in her book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Coaching-Workbook-Unleashing/dp/1567263577/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;s=aps&amp;tag=theprojectm0d-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;qid=1336743762&amp;camp=1789&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;creative=9325">The Project Management Coaching Workbook: Six Steps to Unleashing Your Potential</a>.<br /><br />The advice she gives is based on her experience as a coach and mentor. Susanne Madsen offers a method designed to help you understand and articulate what you want to achieve—and then assists you in achieving those goals, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effectively managing a demanding workload</li>
<li>Leading and motivating a team</li>
<li>Building effective relationships with senior stakeholders</li>
<li>Managing risks, issues, and changes to scope</li>
<li>Delegating effectively</li>
</ul>
<p>And in our discussion today, we are going to start you off on this journey by looking at four areas to consider: We have to begin with the end in mind (both for your career as well as on any project you manage), we look at the difference between leadership and management (with a strong focus on people rather than tasks), the importance of effective time management and delegation, and how to stay motivated to progress personally and professionally on such a journey by taking action and not procrastinating.</p>

In this section Jack describes about 20 areas of functional management responsibility that - if addressed properly by the functional manager - will go a long way in avoiding that a project fails.<br /><br />But as we have learned in the last interview, functional managers may not actually be aware of project management fundamentals, let alone that some of their areas of responsibility will in fact help us to deliver a successful project. So my primary thought was... how do I as a PM approach my functional manager and tell him or her that I need their assistance in areas such as business politics or lack of organizational support?</p>

To succeed, we routinely depend on the functional managers - the person who runs the department or division, who resolves day-to-day operational issues, and who is responsible for ensuring that the project team has the resources it needs and keeps its goals aligned with the company’s overall strategy and vision.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are only few functional managers who speak our language or even have firm grasp on the most fundamental of project processes. Too often, this knowledge gap leads to poor communications, conflict, schedule delays, cost overruns and lost business opportunity.<br /><br />And who gets the blame? Yup... we do.<br /><br />To help bridge this gap we are interviewing Jack Ferraro, PMP (<a href="http://www.myprojectadvisor.com/">www.myprojectadvisor.com</a>) who wrote the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Non-Project-Managers-Ferraro/dp/0814417361/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;tag=theprojectm0d-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Project Management for Non-Project Managers</a>”. We discuss the many ways in which functional managers can get involved in project success and we also discuss the four key project management skills that any functional manager needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Articulating the real customer need and business case</li>
<li>Staying focused on project deliverables</li>
<li>Understanding your key dependencies</li>
<li>Being proactive about project risk.</li>

Over the years the following two collection of PM Templates have become my favorite: PM Templates from Method123 at www.pm-podcast.com/method123 PM Templates from The Template Collective at www.pm-podcast.com/collective In this video I show you what they have to offer and we open up a couple of examples from both products. Please note that The PM Podcast is a compensated affiliate of both Method123 and The Template Collective. If you click and then buy their templates we will earn a commission, with which I will buy a pizza and that will keep my enthusiasm up to continue producing great podcast episodes for you. {loadposition content_adsense468} </itunes:summary><itunes:keywords>project,management,pmi,pmp,pdu,pmpodcast,cornelius,fichtner</itunes:keywords></item>
