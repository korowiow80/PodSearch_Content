      <title>Journey to Arcturus:</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1104568/600x600_2667727.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ffff;&quot;&gt;Hello everyone around the globe. It is with this expedition that I say goodbye (well...for now anyway) to the Chronicles of the Psychonautilus podcast. Worry not for I am not giving up on podcasting. Though it may seem strange I am actually starting a new podcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last (audio version) of The Chronicles of the Psychonautilus is called:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Journey to Arcturus:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In this expedition I take a close look at what I feel was the over all message of the COTP podcast series. I try to put in words what my main message to the world has been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we have a cat purring meditation followed by an interview with none other than the girl of my dreams and the love of my life, my beautiful wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the Psychonautilus answers a call from another pandimensional research vessel named The Entheos. This begins a very long journey where we will be traveling through a sunspot star gate to reach the star Arcturus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ffff;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ffff;&quot;&gt;I also feature the music of my good friend James Sanger. In the radio play &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Journey to Arcturus&lt;/span&gt; I use his song &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Fairground&lt;/span&gt;. And after that for background music I use two of my favorite pieces by James, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Wood cut&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Japanese+Lou.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: book antiqua,palatino;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ffff;&quot;&gt;To rap it up I share a recent epiphany, or revelation or maybe it's just a crazy idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ffff;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: tahoma,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Also there are other brand new Wu Wei Production websites for you:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wuweiproductions.motionsforum.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://wuweiproductions.motionsforum.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/WuWeiProductionz&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/user/WuWeiProductionz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: comic sans ms,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #00ffff;&quot;&gt;This is not the end of the story.

      <title>Expedition #14 part2</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1104568/600x600_2628182.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally the continuation of my conversation with Nassim Haramein. Sorry for such a long time in between episodes but things are as they are and so for this expedition the time is now. My thanks to all for hanging in there and I hope you find it all worth the wait.

In part two we start out just chatting about our kids and then we dive deeply into a discussion about time and the source and act of creation. I ask Nassim to elaborate on how matter actually comes into being. He explains how particles blink in and out of existence. What we call matter is actually only in existence for an instant.

 This is the way I would describe it:
What appears to us as a solid reality we experience as solid only because of the echo of creation. The moment of creation is in perpetual motion.

Maybe this is what Buckminster Fuller means in his quote:
&quot;Scenario universe is non-simultaneously apprehended&quot;.

Expedition# 14


Nassim Haramein is on board as my guest! I just don't have words to express how cool this is. To say that Nassim Haramein's work is on the cutting edge, that he's taking us all to the next level, well that would be an incredible understatement. Nassim's work is shattering all levels and is taking us all so far beyond the edge that we have all been set free. And that edge, that most contemporary scientists and physicists have been holding on to so strongly for all theses years, it is no longer relevant.
