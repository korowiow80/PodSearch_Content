<p>There is no better hotspot online for BMX bike videos than the WoozyBMX Youtube Video Channel featuring wild and crazy BMX Videos.  The WoozyBMX Channel invites you to subscribe (free!), leave comments and join their Facebook page at facebook.com/woozy.bmx.magazine after you watch a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsoHHQlZPOs" target="-blank">crazy bmx video</a> or two or three or more.</p>
<p>There are almost 50,000 subscribers to this BMX Youtube Channel so you know the Channel is stocked with a huge archive of sick videos of BMX rider stunts, jumps and tricks plus frequent new BMX bike video updates.  The BMX bike videos at WoozyBMX have collected over 31,000,000 views, yeah, you read that number right, over 31 million views, so you know that this isn&#8217;t some lame BMX Youtube Channel.  The BMX Videos at WoozyBMX showcase top sponsored pro BMX riders from all over the world along with dazzling unknowns who show off their skillz at BMX street riding, jumping, etc.  There are <a href="http://youtube.com/woozybmx" target="_blank">more bmx videos</a> at WoozyBMX than if you waste your time on google trying to hunt down BMX videos that people post on different websites around the web.  At WoozyBMX, there are BMX bike videos  professionally shot, BMX bike videos with FX, and some with awesome music, but there are also incredible amateur BMX bike videos, too.        </p>

<p/>
<p>Today we&#8217;ll be taking a quick look at the Call of Duty ELITE Android application, which is designed to be installed on almost any Android device that runs Android 2.2 and above. For any of you who don&#8217;t know what Call of Duty ELITE is, it is a membership that you can join for free (they have paid memberships, too), and view stats from your online gaming session while playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. The Call of Duty ELITE Android application lets you view statistics on the past games you&#8217;ve played, as well as lets you show off your current level and prestige as well as your custom loadout classes and much more.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty ELITE Android app also lets you see nice line graphs showing your kill to death ratio of the latest games you&#8217;ve played, and you can even check on all of the challenges that you&#8217;re working on so you can see how close you are to getting that new badge or title. One of the most special benefits of using this application is the ability to make changes to your custom classes and push them to your gaming account on your XBOX or PS3, essentially allowing you to change your weapon setup anywhere you have internet access on your phone! </p>
<p>One final benefit of the Call of Duty ELITE Android application what we want to touch on is that you&#8217;re even able to check out all of your friends&#8217; stats from their gameplay and see how much better they are than you (or the other way around!). If you want to check out the app now, go to the Google Play Store, search for Call of Duty ELITE, and download the app today!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;<a href="http://robbievelez.com/" target="_blank">Robbie Velez and The Key To Rocket City</a>&#8221; is an exciting suspense story for ages ten and up. This story would be perfect for a movie and video game series. As readers have commented, the book will keep you on the edge of your seat to the very end. The adventure novel is very creative and is full of surprises and lots of imagination.  This book would definitely appeal to gamers as it features many elements which gamers enjoy including a mech futuristic setting, robots, a Cyborg War, a government which is not trusted by future Americans, a strong hero and friends who are united in their quest for survival&#8230;</p>
<p><center><img src="http://www.theovercast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Book1.Cover3_-204x300.jpg" alt="Robbie Velez and the Key to Rocket City" title="Robbie Velez and the Key to Rocket City" width="204" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-3697" /></a></center><br/></p>
<p>Critics and reviewers have compared the book to the Harry Potter book series and The Hunger Games as it features teens in a magical, fantastical or futuristic world who are driven to take action to explore their world and to fight and survive within it.  Many books are not appropriate to teen, tween or pre-teen audience, but the author of the Robbie Velez series, A. J. Arias, has tailored the series to appeal to the youth and young adult market.  In addition, the author has configured social media integration so that fans of the series can follow on Twitter, join the Facebook fan page, be a Myspace friend or watch Robbie Velez videos on the &#8220;Robbie Velez and the Key to Rocket City&#8221; Youtube Video Channel.  The Robbie Velez book series is building reader and viewer momentum and similar to the success of the Harry Potter books and The Hunger Games film&#8217;s incredible box office numbers, it may one day be as popular as both Harry Potter and The Hunger Games.    </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many gamers who play video games on their computers or who create Gameplay Videos or Machinima animation shop for computers which have powerful video graphics cards and sound cards.  Also crucial are fast processors which most MMORPG players look for because of the nature of massively multiplayer online role playing games.  Gamers also look for at least 6 gigabytes of RAM for their gaming computers since anything less than 6 gigs of RAM won&#8217;t suffice for gaming computer systems.  Because gaming computers need more power and other features than home computers, gamers look for discount coupons and codes to save money when buying a new gaming computer.  Using <a href="http://kimscoupons.com/merchant/dell-small-business" target="_blank">Dell digital coupons</a> is one way for gamers to save money when building their new gaming computer system.  Dell computers allow buyers to customize their computer to their specifications, which is a must for gamers and gameplay video creators.</p>
<p>Another way to save on computer gaming systems is to use <a href="http://kimscoupons.com/merchant/dell-home" target="_blank">Dell coupon codes</a>.  These codes can save money on the purchase of a Dell computer system or offer other incentives to Dell computer buyers.  Don&#8217;t pay list price for a Dell computer for a new computer gaming system when you can save money using Dell digital coupons or Dell coupon codes.  These coupons and codes change periodically as Dell features different offers including free shipping, as an example.  Dell computers can be ordered online or through Dell direct, but be sure to have your Dell digital coupons or Dell coupon codes ready when you place your order to maximize your savings.     </p>
