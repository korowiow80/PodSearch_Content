      <title>Episode 4 Nothing But A Gangster Party! 80's R&amp;B mix</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/29728/600x600_3807361.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy 2011!   This is pod cast #4 in my series of OLD SCHOOL 80&amp;rsquo;S hip hop and R&amp;amp;B mix tapes.   I began my professional DJ career in 1980's while attending college at NCCU in Durham, N.C.  At the time I referred to myself as the Notorious DJ Gangster Gales. The name was suggested to me my older brother Alonzo &quot;Elijah&quot; in High School.    In 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got my first gig as a radio personality for a local radio station in Raleigh N.C.  The general manager at the time made me change it due to all of the controversy surrounding the rap group NWA and their song &amp;ldquo;Fuck The Police&amp;rdquo;.  I was never a real Gangster, nor was I ever down with selling drugs or violence.  I just like the clothes they wore in the Godfather movies of the 70&amp;rsquo;s.    I would love to hear some of your stories about life back in the Hip Hop and R&amp;amp;B 1980's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why not reach out to me and I can get you the podcast show sometime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s where you can reach me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <itunes:summary>Happy 2011!   This is pod cast #4 in my series of OLD SCHOOL 80&amp;rsquo;S hip hop and R&amp;amp;B mix tapes.   I began my professional DJ career in 1980's while attending college at NCCU in Durham, N.C.  At the time I referred to myself as the Notorious DJ Gangster Gales. The name was suggested to me my older brother Alonzo &quot;Elijah&quot; in High School.    In 1991.
I got my first gig as a radio personality for a local radio station in Raleigh N.C.  The general manager at the time made me change it due to all of the controversy surrounding the rap group NWA and their song &amp;ldquo;Fuck The Police&amp;rdquo;.  I was never a real Gangster, nor was I ever down with selling drugs or violence.  I just like the clothes they wore in the Godfather movies of the 70&amp;rsquo;s.    I would love to hear some of your stories about life back in the Hip Hop and R&amp;amp;B 1980's.

      <title>In Memory of Legendary 80's Hip Hop Rap Aritst RIP Heavy D.</title>

&lt;H1&gt;Heavy D&lt;/H1&gt;

Dwight Arrington Myers &lt;P&gt;
May 24, 1967- November 8, 2011 (aged 44)&lt;P&gt;

Dwight Arrington Myers(May 24, 1967 &#8211; November 8, 2011, better known as Heavy D, was a Jamaican-born American actor, rapper, record producer, singer and former leader of Heavy D &amp; the Boyz, a hip hop group which included G-Whiz (Glen Parrish), &quot;Trouble&quot; T. Roy (Troy Dixon), and Eddie F (born Edward Ferrell). The group maintained a sizable audience in the United States through most of the 1990s. The five albums the group released were produced by Teddy Riley, Marley Marl, his cousin Pete Rock and Eddie F.&lt;P&gt;

Myers was born on May 24, 1967 in Mandeville, Jamaica, the son of Eulahlee Lee, a nurse, and Clifford Vincent Myers, a machine technician. His family moved to Mount Vernon, New York, in the early 1970s,[6] where he was raised.&lt;P&gt;

Heavy D &amp; the Boyz were the first group signed to Uptown Records; their debut, Living Large, was released in 1987. The album was a commercial success, though Big Tyme was a breakthrough that included four hits. Trouble T. Roy died at age 22 in a fall on July 15, 1990, in Indianapolis. Dixon's death led to a tribute on the follow-up platinum album, Peaceful Journey. Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth created a tribute to Trouble T. Roy called &quot;They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)&quot; which is regarded as a hip-hop classic.&lt;P&gt;

Heavy D &amp; the Boyz gained even more fame by singing the theme song for the television program In Living Color and also MADtv, and Heavy D performed the rap on Michael Jackson's hit single &quot;Jam&quot; as well as sister Janet Jackson's hit single &quot;Alright&quot;. Heavy D then began focusing on his acting, appearing in various television shows before returning the music charts with Nuttin' But Love. After appearing in the off-Broadway play Riff Raff at Circle Repertory Company, Heavy D returned to recording with the hit Waterbed Hev.[4] In 1997, Heavy D collaborated with B.B. King on his duets album Deuces Wild rapping in the song &quot;Keep It Coming.&quot; Heavy D was referred to in the song &quot;Juicy&quot; by the Notorious B.I.G., and appeared in his music video for &quot;One More Chance&quot;.&lt;P&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Myers became the first rapper to head a major music label, when he became the president of Uptown Records. Myers helped to develop rhythm-and-blues singer Mary J. Blige's career and hired Sean &#8220;Diddy&#8221; Combs as an intern. He later became the senior vice president at Universal Music.&lt;P&gt;

Heavy D performed at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards in October 2011. It was his first live performance in 15 years. Myers died on November 8, 2011, in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 44. He collapsed outside his Beverly Hills home and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. It has been reported that his death was due to respiratory distress and that no foul play was involved.&lt;P&gt;</description>
