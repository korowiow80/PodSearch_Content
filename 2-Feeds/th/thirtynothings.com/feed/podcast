	<description>The Thirtynothings: an irreverent, irrelevant and sometimes even funny podcast from a pack of guys in their 30&#039;s, that kinda wish they were still in their 20&#039;s, and act like they&#039;re 13.</description>

	<itunes:summary>Remember that old TV show? We do. We are the podcast that explores mostly irrelevant issues from the perspective of a few guys in their mid-thirties dealing with the aftermath of their slacker years. We talk because we can. Nerdy things such as: movies, tv, comics, books, video games, zombies, current/not so current events. Politics, social issues and those red bumps you found last night in the shower. Nothing is safe.</itunes:summary>

<p>So it seems the cat is out of the bag, the camel is out of the kitchen and Monte&#8217;s python has permanently blinded his last little person. Yes the rumors are true, the beloved Thirtynothings have thrown their collective hats (one top-hat, one fez and three propeller beanies) into the ring and are running for office!  Buoyed by a groundswell of grassroots public support and little orange water-wings, the Thirtynots political platform mostly consists of these hot button topics; girls getting soccer paunched by a robot with a shot-put, Arnie&#8217;s sad sad tune, dirty sexy Asian frying pans, and the legalization of private self-gratification.  After the press release went public a campaign supporter politely told our boys that private self-gratification had actually never been made illegal, shortly thereafter our titans of political savvy announced that all their most pressing concerns had been met and that they were retiring from the political grind.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Worst Halloween Show Ever:</h3>
<p>Three miles from the front the brave doctors of the “Three Oh Nothing Nothing” mobile army surgical hospital learn about life, love, death and the horrors of war. During their run Rob sleeps with his teddy bear, Darren shows up for the ‘cast wearing a dress and Mike and Karl desperately try to find out who has the “hottest lips”. Very special episodes include; getting “happy” and other queer definitions, Giants hitting balls into the family jewels and filthy rotting soulless creatures (who do not appear on the Jersey Shore). All of them are shaken by the news that Jeremy’s plane has been shot down over the Sea of Japan. Robyn’s secret topic for this episode “Are the kids really going to get this reference?”</p>

The Worst Halloween Show Ever:
Three miles from the front the brave doctors of the “Three Oh Nothing Nothing” mobile army surgical hospital learn about life, love, death and the horrors of war. During their run Rob sleeps with his teddy bear, Darren shows up for the ‘cast wearing a dress and Mike and Karl desperately try to find out who has the “hottest lips”. Very special episodes include; getting “happy” and other queer definitions, Giants hitting balls into the family jewels and filthy rotting soulless creatures (who do not appear on the Jersey Shore). All of them are shaken by the news that Jeremy’s plane has been shot down over the Sea of Japan. Robyn’s secret topic for this episode “Are the kids really going to get this reference?”

<p>Setting out on a dark and ill-omened night to summon a great magick upon the face of the world (they were going to curse their enemies’ televisions to show nothing but “Jersey Shore” on every channel), instead those arcane scholars the 30naughts accidentally created this podcast out of pure unchained evil and just a little dash of oregano. Upon realizing what had happened they attempted to banish their foul creation by chanting words that sounded suspiciously like; ‘Another Golden Girl at the Rue Morgue’, ‘Creeping blackness from the darkest depths of the sea envelops phallic coast’, ‘spells to remember “lost” enchantments’ and ‘practical notes on the toppling of evil Umpires’. Local children were said to have horrible dreams that night in which they saw themselves growing up (very slowly) and horribly disappointing their parents.
