			<title>Episode 113 - Where Do We Go From Here?</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[The economy continues its downward spiral and gold and approaching $2000 per ounce.  Where do we go from here?

Silver is also starting to rise again, which some people, including me, think might be a better indicator of how spooked people really are about the economy. Rich people can buy gold anytime they want, but when the average person finally realizes that they need to protect their savings from inflation, silver is usually a better option for them, because it's cheaper.

In the podcast, I again dispel a myth about why it's too late to buy precious metals (gold and silver) and discuss the ongoing issues of what we can expect as we continue on this path to hyperinflation.

Markets are continuing their "bouncing down the stairs" motion. However, watching the markets is a poor indicator of the current state of the economy, because it's mainly reactionary.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 110 - Keeping It Real</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Staying realistic. Real life rarely goes like depicted in works of fiction, like movies or books. While these stories have great entertainment value and, to some extent, provide some really good what-if scenarios, you should keep in mind that the good guys don’t always win.

In this podcast, I discuss two pieces of fiction, a recent movie and a short online book, that deals with the “good guys” losing. Generally, I don’t like this type of fiction because I’m usually looking to escape from everyday life for a little bit and be entertained, etc. But pieces like this are good, because they break us out of that expectation that good guys always win and bad guys always lose.

The point of this is that without proper preparations, you could easily find yourself on the losing side of a disaster.

Remember: Complacency Kills.

			<title>Episode 104 - Update Your Prep Plan</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[With the recent series of extreme disasters that we've been seeing around the world, now is a good time to update your preparedness plan and make sure you have a plan for even those events that aren't likely to happen. Case in point, the earthquake/tsunami/nuclear disaster that's still happening in Japan and the "worst case scenario" tornado that hit Joplin, MO.

While some seem to ignore this basic fact, the earth has a history of cycles. Sometimes things are calm and sometimes things are chaotic. To me, it's fairly obvious that we entered into a chaos period several years ago. The earth and sun go through cycles and these cycles manifest in ways we typically associate with everyday weather and sometimes as disasters: earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc. and, of course, climate.

In the past few years, we have seen more major disasters. Ten years ago, having a 9.0+ earthquake was extremely rare. Currently, four of "The Ten Largest Earthquakes Since 1900" occurred in the past 7 years.  We're also seeing weather extremes that haven't appeared since the first half of last century.

Looking at the list above, the four most recent earthquakes on the list above occurred, in reverse chronological order, in 2011, 2010, 2005 and 2004.  The fifth oldest earthquake on this list occurred in 1965. The period from 1966 to 2003 was a calm period, as far as major earthquakes go.

When looking at these patterns, my concern is that it's not just earthquakes that is changing, but other earth phenomenon, like tornadoes, hurricanes, flooding, drought, etc..  A I write this, two tornadoes have hit Springfield, MA causing many injuries and extensive damage, according to initial reports.

It's been mentioned in several recent podcasts, but it's worth mentioning again. You should review your plans or thinking on what's possible to occur where you live. If you're not in an earthquake area, you should start thinking of what happens if an earthquake hits your town. If you live in an area that doesn't normally get tornadoes or hurricanes, perhaps you live in a fringe area, you may want to brush up on what you're going to do if one suddenly appears.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 103 - Repacking for Food Storage, Part 3</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[This is the third installment of the mini-series about repacking food for your long-term food storage program.

I started this project looking for a way to repack food for long-term storage that was better than using the typical Mylar in bucket. I was looking for something that offered more flexibility and was more space efficient in storage. After trying several different methods, I determined that, while it wasn't perfect, the Mylar in bucket method of storing was superior in some very important aspects.

If you're storing for only a short period of time, other methods would probably work just as good, but when working with a large amount of food, for the amount of work needed to actually get the food to a point where it will be stable in long-term storage, storing in large buckets is the better option. Even with the sometimes hit-or-miss nature of sealing the Mylar bags, I still find it a better option.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 102 - Repacking for Food Storage, Part 2</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Last podcast, I started a small series on Repacking for Food Storage, where I talked about what my goals were and how I was increasing my food storage and how I was going to go about doing that, specifically, in how I was going to repack the bulk foods that I've purchased.

In this part, I continue my discussion on the issues I've been having with various aspects of repacking food, including issues with mylar bags and old O2 absorbers.  Discussing the various aspects of using Mylar and Foodsaver bags for food storage and giving tips for using both.

Food storage should be an important part to your preparations, but from experience, I know that this can be one of the more challenging aspects to getting prepared.

			<itunes:subtitle>In this part, I continue my discussion on the issues I&apos;ve been having with various aspects of repacking food.</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>Last podcast, I started a small series on Repacking for Food Storage, where I talked about what my goals were and how I was increasing my food storage and how I was going to go about doing that, specifically, in how I was going to repack the bulk foods that I&apos;ve purchased.

In this part, I continue my discussion on the issues I&apos;ve been having with various aspects of repacking food, including issues with mylar bags and old O2 absorbers.  Discussing the various aspects of using Mylar and Foodsaver bags for food storage and giving tips for using both.

Food storage should be an important part to your preparations, but from experience, I know that this can be one of the more challenging aspects to getting prepared.  By sharing the errors and successes I&apos;ve experienced, I&apos;m hoping to spare you the time and expense of making the same mistakes I have.

			<title>Episode 101 - Repacking for Food Storage, Part 1</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Up until recently, most of my food storage has been of the “pantry” storage type.  Meaning, most of the foods that we eat on a regular basis bought from the grocery store. We have some long term storage foods in our storage plan, but recently, and for obvious reasons, I’ve started to increase these. I had some specific ideas on how I wanted to repack some of this food, but it didn’t go the way I had hoped.

Up to now, all of the long term food items that I had were packed in cans, most of them factory sealed. This time, I’ve decided to buy bulk food and repackage it myself in order to take advantage of lower costs and stretch my food budget. While I started my plan of increasing what I had, the first step was really to take an inventory of what I had. During this inventory, I opened a couple of cans and was surprised on what I found. Let’s just say that you should plan on storing more than you think you need.

Anyway, this is part one of the three part series on Repacking for Food Storage.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 100 - Special Interview with The Survival Mom</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Here it is.  Episode 100. I suppose there should be some sort of fanfare for this accomplishment, as always seems to accompany such milestones. So here it is:  WEE!

Was that too much? I hope I didn't overdo it.

Really, though, I'm happy that the podcast made it to Episode #100, but it's really the listeners that have brought me to this point. Seriously, I wouldn't have kept doing this podcast if I didn't know that it was having such a positive affect on people. The emails I get from listeners is what keeps me doing this, as the whole reason I started this podcast was to help other people get prepared.

There have been several times in the past where I've considered not recording anymore episodes, but then I would get an email from a listener, saying how much the podcast has helped them, or how the information they got from the podcasts really paid off for them, or helped them to get better prepared. Those are the emails that have kept this podcast going.

So, on this 100th episode, I want to say Thank You! to all the listeners, and especially the ones that have emailed me with their stories. 

Thank you for listening and allowing me to come into your life and helping you get better prepared.

Episode 100 has no fanfare in it, but I do interview The Survival Mom, Lisa Bedford, who runs the TheSurivalMom.com website.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 99 – Potassium Iodide</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[As you may have already heard, there is a plume of radiation headed our way from Japan and should reach the US west coast today. Don’t Panic! As it looks right now,the amount of radiation is very small, however, the real issue may not be how much radiation exists outside your body, but inside it.

In general, the amount of radiation headed our way poses little health risk, but if the any of the particles that are coming here are radioactive iodine-131 (I-131), this can pose an increased threat to the thyroid gland. 

In short, the thyroid absorbs iodine from the things we eat and if it absorbs I-131, then there is a concentrated level of radiation in the thyroid. Unless the radiation is (relatively) high, adults aren’t likely to be affected by small amounts; if you’re in your 40s or 50s, you’ll likely die of natural causes before developing any issues from the I-131 you may have ingested. However, children are very susceptible to thyroid damage. Again, DON’T PANIC. There are things you can do to mitigate this if you’re concerned.

If you’ve been following the news, you have probably heard about people talking about taking potassium iodide or potassium iodate ( aka, KI ) as a way to prevent the thyroid of absorbing radioactive iodine-131. While having this is a good thing to have on hand, the radiation levels aren’t high enough to warrant taking KI tablets, at least, not at this time. If the nuclear crisis in Japan worsens, we could see higher levels here in the US.

After the Chernobyl accident, thyroid radiation exposures occurred mainly due to drinking contaminated milk (this contamination was the result of milk cows grazing on fields affected by radioactive fallout) and to a much lesser extent by eating contaminated vegetables. 

I don’t know if there is any radioactive iodine in the coming radiation cloud, but since kids’ thyroids are so sensitive to this danger and the solution is easy, there’s little risk or danger in taking this simple and easy precaution.

That action is to buy, at least, several weeks of dairy product, especially milk, now. Milk, yogurt, butter, eggs, etc. Milk can be stored in the freezer without any issues (we’ve done it many times). Vegetables and fruit should be washed well and/or peeled.

Since it generally takes less than 2 days for milk to go from cow to grocery store and pasteurization does not destroy the radiation, you should go out get the dairy products soon. Like, no later than Sunday.

Again, there is no need to panic, but if you’re concerned about the potential radiation coming your way, or don’t want to wait to learn that they misjudged or miscalculated what was in the cloud, I recommend that you take these simple and easy precautionary actions now.

Also, do not think that you can take iodized salt or nutritional iodine supplements in lieu of KI. There is about 15 micrograms of iodine in a teaspoon of salt, and probably in the average supplement. KI tabs have 130 milligrams for adults and 65 milligrams for children. This means you would need to take about 1000 teaspoons of salt or 1000 supplement pills every day. That much salt would kill you.

Another point I want to make is the safety of taking KI tabs, should you ever need to take them. Iodine allergies are rare. If you have an allergy to iodine, you already know about it. The potential side effects of taking KI tabs are no worse than the average OTC medicine, like Tylenol, Benadryl, etc. To me, the bigger issue is taking your KI tabs too soon and not having them when you really need them.

Keep in mind that iodine is commonly used, like in military water purification tablets. I have no idea how much iodine is in these tablets, but the water tastes absolutely awful. Hundreds of thousands or possibly millions of people have drank water treated with iodine.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 98 - Avoid Being Too Narrow-Focused</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Like me, I’m sure a lot of people who are preparing that take advantage of current events to focus on certain aspects of their preparedness planning.  For example, the nuclear crisis we’re witnessing in Japan is a good reminder that we need to have radiation detection gear and potassium iodide.  Some of you may be scrambling to buy these things now, in a sudden realization that you have a void area in your prep plan.

While omissions in your preparedness plan need to be taken care of, don’t get so caught up in a single event that you get blindsided by something else.  There are a lot of things happening right now, make sure you’re keeping tabs on all of it. Don’t get too narrow focused.

You may have noticed that there has been a run on the purchasing of radiation meters and potassium iodide tablets. If these are things that you haven’t already thought of getting these before a radiation crisis, now isn’t the time to start looking.  Hopefully, this crisis will pass without the need for them and you’ll be able to fill the hole in your preps in a couple of weeks or so.  However, you should be looking into alternatives, just in case you do need them.

Take the opportunity to learn from this event, re-evaluate your preparedness plan and the gear and supplies you have on hand.  Make plans to take care of getting the things you need as soon as you can, but don’t let yourself forget to keep an eye on the other issues that we’re facing.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 97 - Thoughts on the nuclear crisis happening in Japan.</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Every day the crisis of Japan’s nuclear reactors that were damaged in the earthquake and tsunami gets worse. Currently, one of the reactors is on fire and there’s no way to know how much radiation the reactor is leaking and whether it will stay localized or of it poses a threat to other countries.

If you don’t have potassium iodide or iodate now, good luck finding any.  Probably the only sources available are from the “greedsters” on eBay.  This is why we prepare, so we have the resources available when a disaster or crisis event occurs. Once the event happens, the odds that you’ll be able to get what you need drop to nil.

There is one resource that you can still get, but only because it hasn’t become an issue yet, and that’s powdered milk.  If iodine-131 makes its way over here to the USA and word leaks out about radiation getting into the milk, you’re going to see all of the powdered milk supplies dry up fast.  If you have children and you don’t have a good supply of powdered milk, now is the time to get it.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 94 - Strategic Preparedness Plan</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[In a nutshell, here is the Strategic Preparedness Plan that I've been using to get ready for the dollar collapse and the coming depression:

	•	Be true to yourself.  Know why you're prepping and what you're prepping for.  Don't let anyone distract you from getting ready.
	•	Stock up on everything; especially food and sundries. The coming depression is going to be a long term event; there's little chance that you'll be able to stock up and store everything you will need for the duration.  Instead, stocking up now will allow you to buy things while they are still cheap, and (hopefully) allow you to take advantage of periods when prices are lower (like sales, etc.) and avoid having to buy when prices are higher.
	•	Get out of debt.  Your income will not go up at the same rate as inflation.
	•	Buy silver and gold.  As the dollar collapses, precious metals will increase in value.  Don't sit on too much cash.
	•	Acquire farmland and/or plant edible plants around your home. In all depression and hyperinflation events, food is the biggest concern.  Having the ability to grow your own food is a big thing.
	•	Educate yourself.  How to grow food; cook food from scratch; make and mend clothes, repair things, etc.  Learn how to do things the way our grandparents used to do things.
	•	Form a prep community.  Family or good friends, develop a group of people you can rely on to get together and help each other out. 
	•	Think outside the box.  Solutions are often found when you're not thinking like everyone else.]]></description>

Instead, stocking up now will allow you to buy things while they are still cheap, and (hopefully) allow you to take advantage of periods when prices are lower (like sales, etc.) and avoid having to buy when prices are higher.
	•	Get out of debt.  Your income will not go up at the same rate as inflation.
	•	Buy silver and gold.  As the dollar collapses, precious metals will increase in value.  Don&apos;t sit on too much cash.
	•	Acquire farmland and/or plant edible plants around your home. In all depression and hyperinflation events, food is the biggest concern.  Having the ability to grow your own food is a big thing.
	•	Educate yourself.  How to grow food; cook food from scratch; make and mend clothes, repair things, etc.  Learn how to do things the way our grandparents used to do things.
	•	Form a prep community.  Family or good friends, develop a group of people you can rely on to get together and help each other out. 
	•	Think outside the box.  Solutions are often found when you&apos;re not thinking like everyone else.</itunes:summary>

			<title>Episode 88 - Inflation Prices</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[I decided to push out this podcast before the second part of the Bug Back podcast because I thought it was important enough for you to get this info now.  Here’s a snippet from the National Inflation Association (NIA) about what we can expect prices to look like in the near future due to QE2:

“NIA projects that at the average U.S. grocery store it will soon cost $11.43 for one ear of corn, $23.05 for a 24 oz loaf of wheat bread, $62.21 for a 32 oz package of Domino Granulated Sugar, $24.31 for a 32 fl oz container of soy milk, $77.71 for a 11.30 oz container of Folgers Classic Roast Coffee, $45.71 for a 64 fl oz container of Minute Maid Orange Juice, and $15.50 for a Hershey’s Milk Chocolate 1.55 oz candy bar. NIA also projects that by the end of this decade, a plain white men’s cotton t-shirt at Wal-Mart will cost $55.57.”]]></description>

			<title>Episode 87 - Bugging Back</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Bugging Back is a term used to mean getting back to your home.  In many cases, and probably most cases, you're not going to be bugging out of town, but trying to get back to your family.  This is particularly true for people who don't work at home, as most events will not require you to bug out from your home, but you'll definitely want to get back to it.

In order to bug back, I see there are 3 basic levels of preparedness for this.  It starts what with many call the "everyday carry" level of gear, which is what you carry on your person at all times. These items should help you get to the next level of where you stored your gear.  Let's take for example someone that works in a building.  The gear you carry on your person should help you get to the stuff that you keep in your desk or locker.  The items that you keep at work should help you escape to your vehicle, and your vehicle and the stuff in it helps you get back home.

This layering makes it so that you don't have to carry your bug-out gear with you 100% of the time.

			<title>Episode 77 - The New Colony</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Rob and Mike discuss points about the new "Colony" on Discovery Channel and apply it to the real world.  Sometimes it helps to watch what other people do to learn what to do and, in this case, what not to do.  I think it airs on Tuesdays, but check your local listings.  You can also view it online.

Things we noticed:

- no guns
- no fortified defense
- no leadership
- no firewatch
- being too friendly to strangers

The first and most glaring thing to us was that there were no guns.  If like either they never existed, or perhaps the producers feel that so few people own guns that it wouldn't be an issue in the aftermath of an apocalypse.  They could have at least tried, by using Airsoft or paintball guns.

Like last season, the two biggest issues are the "colonists" chose not to have one person in charge and they didn't set up fortified defenses.  This is particularly interesting, as I think it was the carpenter that stated, in one of those candid moments that he's been preparing for this for a long time.  Or something to that effect.  I'm not sure if that means that he considers himself a survivalist, or if he's just been preparing for the show.

Unlike last season, the Colonists get attacked early; much earlier than those of last season.  The second attack involved about 30 people who eventually made off with about half of their supplies or more.  The Colony had a good amount of medical supplies, but it looks like they lost all of it, and half their food supply, to the mob that attacked them.

It's human nature to want to help your fellow man, but the first two episodes show why it may be a bad idea to do so.]]></description>

			<title>Episode 74 - WE&apos;RE BACK!</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Today’s podcast is brought to you by Audible.com – get a FREE audiobook download at audiblepodcast.com/prepcast.

New edition of the prep' 'cast. It's been nearly 4 months since the last episode.  Why?  Mostly financial (other factors include time, and a bad mobile mic).

Now, we're on a new server with cheaper bandwidth, so we'll see how it goes.

I've also installed new tracking on the podcasts and I can see that even though I haven't put out a new show in a while, the podcast continues to draw new people to it.  I take this to mean that there are more and more people looking at the state of the world and deciding that being better prepared might be a good thing.

To all of you new listeners, welcome!  

To all of you who are past listeners, welcome back!

Before I get too much farther, I want to get to the sponsor of the podcast.  Looking at the numbers from the tracking, it looks like we have a lot more listeners than I thought we did, and so I'm going to be getting some advertisers to help support the show.

The sponsor for this episode is Audible.  If you've listened to my past podcasts, you've heard me talk about Audible books.  And that's because I love listening to books.  I also like reading books, but you can't read a book and drive to work, or work on a project while reading.  This is why Audible books comes in.  You can listen to really great books while you're doing other things.  

I listen on my way to and from work, or anytime I'm driving and I'm alone.  It's a great way to beat the traffic, as you can listen to a great story and not be concerned with how slow traffic is.  I listen while I work out or when working out in the garage or yard.  So far I've listened to over 20 books and really, they're great.

Recommended Book: Lucifer's Hammer, by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle

Main focus of the coming shows will be focusing on Getting Ready for Hyperinflation and Preparing for the Coming Economic Collapse.  As it stands right now, the two main camps of thought are we're either heading for deflation or we're headed for hyperinflation.  There are a few that think that we're having deflation now and The Fed is fighting it with hyperinflation; which is enough to make you lose sleep just thinking about that one.

Just as a point of reference, here's how I define the following.  Keep in mind that these are my definitions on how I keep these straight in my head.  There are probably better definitions, but this is how I understand them:

	•	Deflation - An economic period marked by falling prices.  It also defines a period where the money supply is shrinking.  Typically, both of these mean that the dollar is gaining in purchasing power.  
	⁃	"More goods chasing the same amount of money."
	•	Inflation - This is the normal inflation that we experience year after year and is defined by prices creeping up ever so slowly, but constantly. 
	⁃	"More money chasing the same amount of goods."
	⁃	Anything under 10%.
	•	Mass Inflation - A sharp rise above what we see normally year to year.
	⁃	10% - 30%
	•	Hyperinflation - Prices are rising so fast that the inflation rate is reported by the month, not the year.
	⁃	30% and greater (sometimes, much greater).
	⁃	
We'll be looking at these and how to get ready in the coming episodes.  Also, I've roped Jeff Bennet into doing some shorter podcasts on the economy.  He'll be covering things from a historical viewpoint and covering current news.

	Fast Packs - would like to see it go 3 or 4 shows.  LOL
- Jeff from St Louis - thought obstacle would be wife.  Then power went out and was able to still provide for family with preps.  Finds out that wife is already doing "prep" things.

Phone in your questions!  If you have a question or comment, you can call 1-888-365-4017 and leave a voice mail.  Right now there is a generic outgoing message, as I'm testing out the free 30-day trial.  Hopefully we'll get enough people calling in with questions that we can keep it open.  Please keep in mind that when you leave a voicemail, you give us permission to put your question of comment in the podcast, so don't say anything you don't want thousands of people to hear.

	1.	H1N1 Flu
	⁃	spreading fast, widely infectious, low mortality.
	⁃	Mutation likely, but unknown if it would get deadlier.  Something to watch out for.
	2.	Food Shortage
	⁃	http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-09/bc-twe091009.php
	⁃	"Wheat experts from 26 countries warn that rapidly-moving, wind-borne transboundary wheat diseases continue to threaten food security and wheat genetic diversity worldwide — particularly in the ancient breadbasket stretching from the Middle East to India…"
	⁃	"Of particular concern is the emergence in East Africa of a destructive and virulent strain of black stem rust known as Ug99, which has quickly crossed the Red Sea and moved into the Arabian Peninsula and West Asia. It now appears en route to South Asia, the world's most populous region, where wheat is essential to survival."
	⁃	"… the black stem rust Ug99 is alarming because 80 percent of the world's wheat varieties are susceptible…"
	⁃	Otherwise, the overall global food situation has not gotten any worse, and possibly has increased somewhat.  Though there are still fundamental issues that we should be concerned about (like the lack of any storage of bulk grains in America).
	3.	Economy
	⁃	Still a problem, as nothing has changed.  Still creating a lot of money out of thin air, increasing the risk of inflation.
	⁃	China has made unprecedented cancelations on US hedge funds.
	⁃	US Dollar Index is way down.
	⁃	For the first time ever, Gold closed over $1000 per ounce, at $1005 last week.
	⁃	Jim Sinclair's Email.  JSMineSet.com.  Countdown to Nov 6th meltdown of the US Dollar.

			<title>Episode 19 - Pandemic Flu Information</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Unless you have been living under rock, you have no doubt heard about the Swine Flu.  This show is going to be all about Pandemic Flu, and Swine Influenza A H1N1.  There is a lot of bad information being passed around, so we're going to address the facts and realities of Pandemic Flu.

Facts and status of the flu as of 4-29-2009.
	•	91 laboratory confirmed human cases in US
	•	1 confirmed death in the US
	•	More than 160 deaths in Mexico (not all have been 100% confirmed, but that's Mexico for you).
	•	Pandemic Alert Level 5
	•	This is a new virus - no one has seen it before and no one has any immunity to it.

Really Good FAQ on Swine Flu:
http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/swineflu_you.htm

Flu Transmission Simulation:

How does this flu compare to other pandemic flu?
- Swine flu of 1976
- Spanish Flu of 1918-1919

Mask Model Numbers:

N100 - 3M 8233

Use Calcium Hypochlorite to Disinfect Water

Reputable places that sell masks online:
http://www.buyemp.com/
http://www.envirosafetyproducts.com/

Topics of discussion
	•	Is this serious? What's the big deal about this flu when it hasn't killed anywhere near as many as seasonal flu?
	•	It might not be bad now, but the worry is that it could mutate so.
	•	Prevention, isolation, quarantine
	•	What masks and other PPE? N95 vs N100?
	•	How long do the masks last?
	•	Reusing masks?
	•	Mask vents
	•	Cost of PPE compared to other insurance policies
	•	Be prepared for quarantined, or partial quarantine (like a school closing)
	•	What to store?
	•	How long to store food (etc.) for (maybe several waves of a pandemic flu)
	•	Vaccines?
	•	Decon stuff

Topics of discussion
	•	Is this serious? What&apos;s the big deal about this flu when it hasn&apos;t killed anywhere near as many as seasonal flu?
	•	It might not be bad now, but the worry is that it could mutate so.
	•	Prevention, isolation, quarantine
	•	What masks and other PPE? N95 vs N100?
	•	How long do the masks last?
	•	Reusing masks?
	•	Mask vents
	•	Cost of PPE compared to other insurance policies
	•	Be prepared for quarantined, or partial quarantine (like a school closing)
	•	What to store?
	•	How long to store food (etc.) for (maybe several waves of a pandemic flu)
	•	Vaccines?
	•	Decon stuff

			<title>Episode 18 - Part 1 - Vehicle Preparedness</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Greg and Rob discuss the Transportation category from the Preparedness Capability Checklist (PCC).  This discussion went so long that I decided to split it into 2 podcasts and release them together.

Basically, here's the outline from the PCC:

Minimum Capabilities:
Keep all vehicles in good repair
Four wheel drive on main vehicle, or traction-enhanced (locking differentials, etc.)
Main vehicle needs to be able to carry everyone in family, including a minimum of gear and supplies for 1 week
Main vehicle needs to run on standardized fuel (gasoline, diesel), not specialized fuel (high octane, bio-mix, propane,etc.)
Stored fuel for one full tank (e.g., if your vehicle’s tank holds 20 gallons, store 20 gallons) in man-portable containers
‘Fix a flat’ or Slime
Self-vulcanizing plug kit
Air compressor (12 VDC)
Hose clamps, various sizes (or hose wrap or duct tape)
Siphon hose
Funnels (keep in mind that a funnel for your fuel tank will probably be different from the ones that you use under the hood)
Full-sized spare tire
Emergency road equipment (flares, warning reflectors, etc.)
Navigation (maps, GPS, etc.), stored in vehicle
Basic spare parts (hoses, belts, sparks plugs, fasteners, etc.)
Extra fluids (oil, coolant, transmission fluid, washer fluid, etc.)
Tool kit, stored in vehicle
Fire extinguisher
Jumper cables
Recovery strap/tow rope

Our goal is to reach as many people as possible and help them get better prepared for times when crisis hits.  While we try to be as accurate as possible, we encourage you to do your own research.

You can find more information about us and preparedness online at PrepCast.info, which is our portal to the podcast forum and our blog.  Stop on by and join in the forum discussions or just say hello and tell us what you think of the show.

Getting back to the Preparedness Capability Checklist (PCC).  It's been a while since we hammered home the PCC, so we should touch on it again.  We recap on where people should be with there preparedness plan, if they've been playing the 'at home' game.

The main topic is preparing for the different possible events that can happen.  In reality, you don't need to waste a lot of time writing down all of the possible events and scenarios that may happen to you.  This can lead to a lot of frustration for people who are starting their preparedness plan.  The reason you can skip this is the fact that for nearly every disaster/crisis event, you're going to be providing for the same things - food water, shelter, warmth, defense, etc.  

Hmm... Gee, if there was only some sort of list that covered what these common elements were, it would sure make it simpler to figure out how to prepared for them.

Oh Wait!  The Preparedness Capability Checklist!
http://www.thepreparednessblog.com/capability-checklist/

There are common things that you will need to provide for in all major disasters, and the PCC has already identified them.  Looking at what and how to prepare by using the PCC, it takes the frustration out of the organizing the "things to get prepared for" list.  

Again, playing "what if" scenarios can help you identify which events will require certain actions, like whether to bug out or shelter in place.  We should have some sort of criteria list that helps with this decision-making process.

			<title>Episode 16 - Miscellaneous Preparedness Tips Part 2</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Rob, Greg, and Mike return in episode 16 to finish off the "100 Items to Disappear First in a Disaster Situation" with items 51-100.  As originally approached in episode 14, The PPC crew tries to help people cut through sea of information by offering a review of the "100" list while stressing that the list should be approached as a "think" list as opposed to a definite and finite source for preparedness information.  It's important as preppers, to never take items like the "100 list" as gold standard, but instead use sources as spring boards or inspiration for your own personal preparedness plan.  Preparedness is something that requires active participation and enormous amounts of personalization to be successful.

			<title>Episode 15 - First Aid and Medical Kits</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Podcast 15 - First Aid and Medical Kits.

Stats: 4263 total listeners, up about 1800 listeners from the beginning of the month of March.

Rob, Greg, and Mike return in Podcast 15 to discuss First Aid Kits and Medical Kits.  Lead by Mike, an EMT of 10 years, the group addresses some of the common and uncommon questions brought up when creating, carrying, and maintaining this vital part of anyone's preparedness plan.

Some of the questions or issued addressed by the PPC team are:

What do you want to accomplish with FAK/MK (med kit)

Can't be done with one Bag, etc.

Don't try to overload Kits

Don't try to do too much with FAK.

Will never be a definitive care option.

Do familiarize yourself with items, supplies, and equipment.

Don't include supplies you cannot use or don't know how to use.

Do practice with supplies, just like everything else.

Having ALS supplies ( IV's, non-precription medications, etc) will not typically benefit you.  Use of these items is dangerous.
Exception is if you can find an advanced provider (Physician, Physician assistant, in some cases RN, Paramedic)

Important:  Check and recheck supplies frequently and replace as needed.  Some things don't like hot environments (vehicle, garage, etc) and will deteriorate quickly, medications, and supplies.


The following are some questions for feedback from out listeners, I want to know what you are doing:

Places to store supplies, how to store, and what to store or package them in.

What do we use? Why do we use it?  What have we found that doesn't work.

If you have anything you would like to comment on, please email me: Mike@prepcast.info

			<title>Episode 14 - Miscellaneous Preparedness Tips</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Rob, Greg and Mike discuss a wide variety of preparedness topics and tips.  There is so much information that we would like to give out, but there is a finite amount of time for the podcasts (which is why they keep getting longer and longer!).  In an effort to to cover more, we decided to review a list called "100 Things to Disappear in a Disaster."

Overall, this seems more like someone's shopping list than a true listing of supplies that will quickly disappear, but it provides a good tool to use as a Think List - something that gets you thinking about other things.

Even though the podcast went over 2 hours, we were only able to get through the first 50 list items, but there was some good discussion on these topics.

	⁃	Do you really only need to boil for 1 minute?  From http://www.princeton.edu/~oa/manual/water.shtml:  "Boiling is the most certain way of killing all microorganisms. According to the Wilderness Medical Society, water temperatures above 160° F (70° C) kill all pathogens within 30 minutes and above 185° F (85° C) within a few minutes. So in the time it takes for the water to reach the boiling point (212° F or 100° C) from 160° F (70° C), all pathogens will be killed, even at high altitude. To be extra safe, let the water boil rapidly for one minute, especially at higher altitudes since water boils at a lower temperature."

			<title>Episode 11 - Guns for Home Defense</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[This episode's topic is on Defensive guns, particularly for Home Defense.  

In our past episodes, we have geared our discussions towards beginning preps, but in this show, we're going to be talking about concepts beyond beginning preparedness.  In order to be serious about defending yourself and your family, you need a firearm.  There's no other tool that allows you even the 'playing field' against criminals.

DISCLAIMER: Know your locals laws.  Get professional training.  Do your own research.

			<title>Episode 9 - Preparing to Survive an Economic Crash</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[This episode we look at some things you can do to put your self in a better position for the coming Economic Crash.  We cover things that you can do both before and after a job loss, including some potentially controversial things.

One thing we weren't sure if we made it clear was to start looking for alternative sources of income.  The best time to do this is when you have a job and not after.  Developing alternate revenue streams and downsizing what you spend on every month can go a long way to surviving an economic crisis.

			<title>Episode 3 - Preparedness Issues that Face us Today</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Reviewing and discussing our posts on ThePreparednessBlog.com.

Three main threats that we're facing right now: Economic Crash, Food shortages, Terrorism.

Preparedness is about keeping your options open and keeping opportunities available.

Everyday items you can stock up on now.  

Panic buying of guns and ammo.  Chances are, if you don't have it now, you either can't get it or you're going to pay a lot more for it.

 Weight of supplies and portability.

Does your spouse know how to do everything you can do?  Did you write everything down so their survival chances are maximized even if you weren't around?

Deflation and Inflation.  The experts say that we'll have deflation before we have inflation.  Are we in a deflationary period now?

			<title>Episode 2 - Economic Crisis, Layoff, The Coming Depression</title>
			<itunes:author>The Preparedness Podcast</itunes:author>
			<description><![CDATA[Some of the discussion topics:

Current economic crisis, layoffs, the possible coming depression.  Possibility of a temporary economic bubble that may lull people to sleep.  Inflation and hyperinflation potential.

Protecting your wealth with gold and silver in a hyperinflation economy.  Rob's philosophy on which gold and silver coins to have.

Gun and ammo sales are way, way up because of the President-Elect Obama.  Discussing various firearm selections for different scenarios.  The next (possible) assault gun ban.

Creation of a new college drinking game.

Better to pay down debt or cash on hand? 

Climate change and food shortages.

Apologies for some of the bad (fuzzy) audio on some parts.
