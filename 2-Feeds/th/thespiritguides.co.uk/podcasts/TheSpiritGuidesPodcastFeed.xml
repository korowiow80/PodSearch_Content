<title>The Ebbing Time - A time of great change with Elizabeth Francis
</title>
<itunes:author>Elizabeth Francis, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Elizabeth Francis 'authoress of Gift - from Spiritual wealth to
financial wealth" joins us again this week to discuss the fascinating concept of Ebbing times. Elizabeth will be joining us monthly to share her views on psychic awareness, the awakening and how current affairs fit into the bigger picture.

This months discussion is on the "Ebbing Time". A period where dramatic changes happen which ties neatly into the period of change we're now in and connecting with the whole 2012 / Awakening idea.

I asked Elizabeth to expand on this:

The ebbing time, that's right, is complemented by the flowing time and it continuous, like the waves of the sea - life is never static but it has a rhythm to it that if we can identify we can p

repare ourselves for. Some consider we stay static during the process, and I understand where that thought comes from, but I think it is far more complex than that, well from what I have witnessed it certainly is.

It is a concept I have worked on over the years, based on the ebb and flow of life, the yearly cycles, the cycles of the moon of course, its also tied into the 7 mini cycles and 28 year major cycles of Saturn's return. Then applied it to the history of society up to this present day.

<title>Gift. Interview with Psychic Author Elizabeth Francis. From Spiritual Wealth to Financial Wealth
</title>
<itunes:author>Elizabeth Francis, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show we chatted with Psychic author Elizabeth Francis about her successful debut book titled Gift: From Spiritual Wealth to Financial Wealth. We touched on her own psychic awakening and experiences, the reasons for writing the book as well as discussing the times we are living in with the many changes happening all around us.

To listen to the 50 minute audio interview please use the player above.

One of the fasination topics Elizabeth discussed was the "Ebbing Time". A period where dramatic changes happen which ties neatly into the period of change we're now in and connecting with the whole 2012 / Awakening idea.

I asked Elizabeth to expand on this:

"Yes, the ebbing time, that's right, which is complemented by the flowing time and it continuous, like the waves of the sea - life is never static but it has a rhythm to it that if we can identify we can prepare ourselves for. Some consider we stay static during the process, and I understand where that thought comes from, but I think it is far more complex than that, well from what I have witnessed it certainly is.

It is a concept I have worked on over the years, based on the ebb and flow of life, the yearly cycles, the cycles of the moon of course, its also tied into the 7 mini cycles and 28 year major cycles of Saturn's return. Then applied it to the history of society up to this present day.

The economists

know it as boom and bust."

"Gift - From Spiritual Wealth to Financial Wealth" provides clear, detailed information and explanations that expel many of the myths that surround established spiritual concepts. It shows how to decipher the spiritual codes that come in the forms of signs, symbols and dreams to reveal the messages contained therein. The purposes of correspondences are also explained together with the role auguries and omens have to play in this process.

Gift also provides a step-by-step guide that helps you to acknowledge, identify and harness your unique psychic-self. Practical information is also given for those who wish to turn his or her spiritual wealth into financial wealth by becoming a professional psychic. If you think it is time to start your or enrich your spiritual journey then Gift is the book for you.
I was moved to write this book after being inspired by my clients, many of whom asked if I had written a book. Back then of course the answer was "No, I haven't", but all that started to change in 2006 when I first put fingers to keyboard.

Gift is published by Capall Bann, and can be ordered through the major high street book shops

<title>The Hidden Oracle of India with Andrew Donovan

<description><![CDATA[If someone said they could read your Past, Present and Future from ancient Sanskrit inscriptions written thousands of years ago on a dusty old palm leaf in a country you've never been to before, would you be skeptical?

Well Andrew most certainly was - until he found out otherwise. Nothing prepared him for what the Naadi holy men told him that day - after all, he was supposed to be relaxing on holiday and nothing more.

Yet a chance two hours with the Naadis changed all that forever!

<title>Awakening - Full Soul Integration - 2011/2012 with Chris Thomas
</title>
<itunes:author>Chris Thomas, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Chris Thomas returns for a third show to provide an update to where we are in the awakening / soul integration process which is part of the 7,000 year Human Plan that Chris says is now coming to an end around 2012.

Chris says:

"We humans need to get a grip. We are poised to undergo the greatest level of change ever seen in this, or any other, Universe.

All souls, that have adopted human form, made a promise to ourselves, to the Earth and to the Universe at large that we would fulfil our promise and potential that was offered to us when we undertook a physical existence.
In 1996, we each looked at our state of readiness to reach our full potential. Every person on the planet, at that time, had the ability to achieve our goals but only 40 per cent of the then population decided that they were ready.
Since then, we have undergone massive changes of energy, on a personal and planetary level, and have arrived at the time when our potential could be fulfilled and yet the number of people who are ready to undergo soul reintegration has dropped. Instead of the 40 percent of 1996, by 2011 there are only 15 per cent of the population who have made the necessary adjustments to their lives in order to move forwards."

About Chris:
Chris Thomas is a healer and author of ten books on the subject of healing and the path of Human history. He has the ability to access the Akashic records - believed to be the whole written history of everything that has ever happened on Earth.

<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome to the Spirit Guides.co.uk Network Radio Show with your host, Mark Chatterton. Tonight we are pleased to welcome on the show, Angela Donovan, who is a well known psychic, spiritual mentor and broadcaster. Angela has worked with several well known figures over the years, including the radio 2 DJ, Johnny Walker; Psychic investigator, Jane Goldman, (who is also the wife of Jonathan Ross); and Hollywood actor, Johnny Depp. She is also the author of the books, "The Secrets of Psychic Success" and "The Hidden Oracle of India". We are privileged to be talking to Angela tonight about her latest book, The Wish, which is soon to be published by Hodder and Stoughton. So welcome Angela.

Bio
Born one of a twin, Angela held an innate ability to communicate telepathically with her sister - something they both thought everyone could do! Her first 'encounter' came at the age of three when she was called by a beautiful 'voice', so beginning her spiritual journey and making her question everything that her upbringing and convent education would otherwise have blocked thereafter.

<title>The five key expansions of consciousness on our Journey of Enlightenment with Chris Bourne
</title>
<itunes:author>Chris Bourne, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In this power packed 40 minute podcast show we caught up with Chris Bourne from Open Hand Foundation to talk about their enlightening new documentary, 5 Gateways.

The world is undergoing a very turbulent evolutionary process. As the very fabric of our society crumbles, a new paradigm is unfolding all around us founded on unconditional love, joy and mutual respect for all life. The question is, how do we join it?

There are many paths up the spiritual mountain, for each of us the journey will be unique. Yet we are all influenced in very similar ways as we pass key 'altitudes' on route to the summit. Understanding these transitions can remove much unnecessary suffering in our lives and catalyse our next transition.

Five Gateways is helping people around the world make sense of exactly why our lives are taking the twists and turns they are, it's removing much unnecessary fear and anxiety. Above all, it is inspiring and catalysing a quantum leap in our consciousness.

</title>
<itunes:author>Hanna Ehlers, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[When higher self calls, we must be ready to trust and act, this has not been easy, but Hanna understands the importance of this symbolic statement as she knows in the future many will be without homes and in a place of chaos because this will not have been their choice. Now a little more used to the idea, Hanna finds embarking on this divinely orchestrated move, incredibly fun and liberating. This will mean many more people will benefit and be able to take part, which is the main importance, to be able to offer nomadic accessible spiritual teachings for all those in need.Writing her book as she goes and with suitcase in toe, Hanna will live on donations and the kindness of others, leading by example of the New Earth energies. The workshops are for all and bring deep healing and support from the group journey, which helps us better understand our personal changes and teaches us how to prepare for this new world coming and the end of the old. Additionally Hanna channels the Atlantean teachings passed on through the indigenous peoples, of which Hanna has memories of her incarnations and is further guided by the White Brotherhood on the inner plane.

<title>The Moneyless Man Interview - How he has lived for over 2 years without a penny
</title>
<itunes:author>Mark Boyle, Mark Chatterton</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Hello and welcome to the Spirit Guides.co.uk network radio show, with your host, Mark Chatterton. After a break of a couple of months, we are back with a very special guest, who we have been wanting to interview on the programme for a long time. Tonight's guest is Mark Boyle, otherwise known as the Moneyless Man.

A couple of years ago, Mark was living and working in Bristol. Yet he gave up his full time job and sold his house boat and made the deliberate step of living without any money. This was going to be something Mark would do for one year, and this first year of living without money was documented in his book, "The Moneyless Man - A year of Freeconomic Living". Yet eighteen months later Mark is still living out in the countryside outside Bristol as the Moneyless man. So a warm welcome to you Mark...

The first thing I want to ask you Mark, is that originally this plan of living without money was going to be for just a year, yet here we are, well into your second year as the Moneyless Man. What made you decide to continue with your moneyless lifestyle?

And much more...

<description><![CDATA[The following interview is with Pamela Young, author of Hope Street, the true story of a family with a spiritual gift, Pamela has travelled here and overseas to visit many mysterious sacred sites. In the show she talks about "The Voice", which she has heard since being a small child, "The Voice" always spoke about the times we appear to be living in now, with the many disasters and such like. "The Voice" always spoke about "The Work", which was somehow connected to the idea of reincarnation. Pamela now realises what "The Voice" was telling her and what "The Work" actually is. Listen to the interview using the audio player above.

Interview hosted by Mark Chatterton. Tonight I would like to welcome to the show, Pamela Young, from Horwich in Lancashire. Pamela has just had her first book published called "Hope Street".

So a big welcome to you, Pamela...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 36 - Christmas, Jesus, Kundalini, DNA, Dimensions, Cold Weather</title>
<itunes:author>Gregory Haye, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[The show was based on the following questions kindly sent in by our listeners. Not necessarily in order. To listen please use the audio player above.

Questions:

On Earth we tend to celebrate various religious holidays such a Christmas which is fast approaching, obviously with many religions there is a tendency for Man to add and subtract various teachings by the victors of history. Do spirit celebrate these holidays with us and how much of the true message is still intact today as we celebrate this holiday?
What positive messages can we take from the teachings of the bible that pertinent today?

Can Gregory explain to me whether raising the Kundalini-to the point of what is referred to as samadhi-or living death meditation is dangerous. Would you need a teacher of the highest type to achieve it safely, or is this simply a ruse to keep only a few 'enlightened'?- I am not personally seeking to achieve enlightenment this way- simply trying to achieve a better state of being and connecting to pure, beautiful spirit as Gregory recommends.- but I would like to know the dangers of projection from the dense body if it occurs- thanks
What is the role 'extraterrestrial beings' are presently playing in the development of the human race and of the earth?

Although I'm aware that viruses, radiation and some carcinogenic chemicals can damage our DNA, some people talk about it being possible for your DNA to be positively changed. For example I've read that some Russian scientists (e.g. Gariaev) propose Wave Genetics more accurately explains our genetics than today's conventional genetics where apparently 2% of DNA is used the other 98% written off as junk. Wave genetics says the other 98% is not junk but a super code, of a higher level than the genes we know of. 

This "higher level" is the "wave level" and is quasi-intelligent. It also proposes that light, sound (e.g. sound therapy) and even affirmations can heal our DNA. What does Gregory think of this theory? 

I've also read some people claim that our so called ' junk DNA' is responsible for psychic abilities, is this true or also junk?

Is the double helix (or 2 strand) DNA structure a common feature of all physical life on this planet and elsewhere in the universe, and is talk of additional DNA strands being possible in humans as silly as it sounds? 

A question related to the last show. Gregory mentioned that with the ability to be aware of other dimensions that the 'blinkers would come off' and we would see how to get 'free' energy from water and the like. Are any humans yet able to see/sense these other dimensions and will all humans eventually be able to see or sense them? Are some ET's able to take advantage of these other dimensions for travel or other purposes? 

String theory in physics talks about lots of extra dimensions for the maths in the theory to work - are these what is meant?

A question was asked about a possible Time Traveller being spotted in a 50 year old Charlie Chaplin movie, who appears to be talking over a mobile phone. While watching the DVD extras for The Circus, an Irish filmmaker has spotted a woman who appears to be using a mobile phone, fifty years before their invention. The group will report back in a later show their findings.

With the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange being aggressively pursued it does appears he is the real deal. Gregory gave us an update.

Are we heading into a new Mini Ice-Age?

As per the T.V show The Event, are there E.Ts that look just like us?



And much more...

Is the double helix (or 2 strand) DNA structure a common feature of all physical life on this planet and elsewhere in the universe, and is talk of additional DNA strands being possible in humans as silly as it sounds? 

A question related to the last show. Gregory mentioned that with the ability to be aware of other dimensions that the 'blinkers would come off' and we would see how to get 'free' energy from water and the like. Are any humans yet able to see/sense these other dimensions and will all humans eventually be able to see or sense them? Are some ET's able to take advantage of these other dimensions for travel or other purposes? 

String theory in physics talks about lots of extra dimensions for the maths in the theory to work - are these what is meant?

A question was asked about a possible Time Traveller being spotted in a 50 year old Charlie Chaplin movie, who appears to be talking over a mobile phone. While watching the DVD extras for The Circus, an Irish filmmaker has spotted a woman who appears to be using a mobile phone, fifty years before their invention. The group will report back in a later show their findings.

With the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange being aggressively pursued it does appears he is the real deal. Gregory gave us an update.

Are we heading into a new Mini Ice-Age?

As per the T.V show The Event, are there E.Ts that look just like us?


And much more</itunes:subtitle>
<itunes:summary>The show was based on the following questions kindly sent in by our listeners. Not necessarily in order. To listen please use the audio player above.

Questions:

On Earth we tend to celebrate various religious holidays such a Christmas which is fast approaching, obviously with many religions there is a tendency for Man to add and subtract various teachings by the victors of history. Do spirit celebrate these holidays with us and how much of the true message is still intact today as we celebrate this holiday?
What positive messages can we take from the teachings of the bible that pertinent today?

Can Gregory explain to me whether raising the Kundalini-to the point of what is referred to as samadhi-or living death meditation is dangerous. Would you need a teacher of the highest type to achieve it safely, or is this simply a ruse to keep only a few 'enlightened'?- I am not personally seeking to achieve enlightenment this way- simply trying to achieve a better state of being and connecting to pure, beautiful spirit as Gregory recommends.- but I would like to know the dangers of projection from the dense body if it occurs- thanks
What is the role 'extraterrestrial beings' are presently playing in the development of the human race and of the earth?

Although I'm aware that viruses, radiation and some carcinogenic chemicals can damage our DNA, some people talk about it being possible for your DNA to be positively changed. For example I've read that some Russian scientists (e.g. Gariaev) propose Wave Genetics more accurately explains our genetics than today's conventional genetics where apparently 2% of DNA is used the other 98% written off as junk. Wave genetics says the other 98% is not junk but a super code, of a higher level than the genes we know of. 

This "higher level" is the "wave level" and is quasi-intelligent. It also proposes that light, sound (e.g. sound therapy) and even affirmations can heal our DNA. What does Gregory think of this theory?

<title>Shroud of Turin - Resurrection of Jesus? and Power over Atoms with Dr Silverman</title>
<itunes:author>Dr Andrew Silverman, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA["The Shroud of Turin or Turin Shroud is a linen cloth bearing the image of a man who appears to have suffered physical trauma in a manner consistent with crucifixion. It is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, northern Italy." Wikipedia

Dr.Andrew Silverman, a medical doctor joins us on the show to discuss ideas and scientific concepts that Nigel Kerner and himself presented to a worldwide audience of experts at the recent Frascati conference in Italy, about how the image may have been formed on the Shroud. It is Nigel's thesis that the Shroud of Turin is the most powerful illustration paradigm to show the power over atoms of someone who lived for existence beyond the atomic state. 

There is a popular misconception that the image on this cloth purportedly created by the resurrection process of the Jewish born Christian teacher Yeshua Ben Yosef (Jesus Christ), was the product of a forgery based upon carbon dating of the Shroud done in 1988. But there has been significant evidence revealed since then that suggests that the dating was invalid.

<title>Chris Thomas - Planet Earth - The Universe's Experiment - The Annunaki Plan? Or The Human Plan?</title>
<itunes:author>Chris Thomas, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[This weeks show is hosted by Mark Chatterton who took time out to speak with Chris Thomas, author of Planet Earth - The Universe's Experiment. 

Chris Thomas is a healer and author of ten books on the subject of healing and the path of Human history. He has the ability to access the Akashic records - believed to be the whole written history of everything that has ever happened on Earth. 

In the show Chris talks about his direct experiences with the Akashic records where he has been able to scan this huge living consciousness of memories for knowledge of the true human plan, directly. He has discovered a race of beings known as the Velon aka the Annunaki that have been trying to hold us back, whilst also manipulating governments.

However he does say that there are other races here to assist us with our completion to full consciousness, where we ultimately integrate the whole soul in the body, effectly becoming a true Human Being.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 35 - WikiLeaks, Euro Debt Crisis, Higher Self, Oversouls, Soul Planets</title>
<itunes:author>Gregory Haye, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Topics discussed: WikiLeaks, European Debt Crisis, Higher Self, Over Souls, Free Energy, Akashic Records for Plants, Planets and Insects, Door Keepers, Soul Groups.

WikiLeaks and European Debt Crisis

If you have been following the news over the last year, you would have been witness to the previously released documents by WikiLeaks, touching on sensitive subjects as the war in Iraq and Afghanistan. Moving forward to November 2010 we now have the disclosure of embarrassing diplomatic communications between world politicians and diplomats. On the surface it would appear that WikiLeaks is part of the long awaited "Truths to be Revealed" energy that many spiritual channellers, seekers and truthers have been eagerly waiting for. 

The next set of documents will apparently reveal how some of the big banks have been misbehaving, no surprise there, but to see that in writing could be Earth shattering. I for one really hope WikiLeaks is truly part of a disclosure campaign to bring transparency and accountability so the good citizens of the planet can walk forward in a more honest and just world. However, I do have my doubts, where perhaps good information is mixed with disinfo to forward one particular group's agenda. 
With this in mind, I thought this would make a great topic of discussion for the start of the show. So playing the Devils Advocate role, I grilled Gregory on his view of the WikiLeaks release and the current European debt crisis.

The show was also based on these questions sent in by our listeners.

Do plants have soul groups as well? And if so, does this apply also to lesser plant species such as grass? 

Do plants have doorkeepers as well? 

Is it possible to belong to more than one soul group at a time? 

So humans and animals have an akashic record, but does each galaxy, universe and even entire physical dimension have its own akashic record? 

Do plants have an akashic record as well? What about insects? 

If not insects, then do insects have spirit?

1. If someone is incarnated on Earth (or elsewhere for that matter) is it possible to speak to their 'higher self' via a medium and if so would the incarnated person be aware in any way of this conversation? 

2. Some people describe there being 2135 (human) soul groups associated with Earth, then each of these groups contain 144,00 Monad groups, each of these has 12 over souls and finally each of these has 12 individual souls giving over 44 billion individual souls associated with Earth (some incarnated and some not). Apparently within these different levels one can be more or less aware of the souls therein depending on various factors. Can Gregory confirm his understanding? 

3. Some people say that you can get 'free energy' from water to power produce power e.g. to power vehicles either via a 'Joe cell', a 'Stanley-Meyer' cell or Bob Boyce's work amongst others. At first sight this seems to violate the laws of thermodynamics - can Gregory elaborate on whether these cells can actually produce free energy? If they could it clearly would be a big help for the planet and to counter peak oil.


And much more...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 34 - Enlightenment and Veganism, Shambhala, Gulf Mystery, Phoenix Lights</title>
<itunes:author>Gregory Haye, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Today's guest is spirit being Gregory Haye and The White Cloud Group. Answer's brought through via deep trance mediumship by Mick and Sylvia Avery. 

Gregory started the show with an address on "asking the right questions".

The show was based on the following questions kindly sent in by our listeners.

I would like to ask Gregory questions on Shambhala-firstly is there a rarefied place of this name constructed somewhere above our world-where great souls presumably like the Great White Brotherhood, Shining Ones etc exist to assist earth? 

Does Gregory live at times still in a personal space despite having to be so involved in helping so many- does he still retreat into beautiful places there for refreshment- or is it ceaseless benevolent activity on his part?

The listener also asked for an update on the strange build up and activity out in the Gulf of Mexico connected to many of the worlds subs being in the area.

Discussing the major sighting of a mile long craft over Phoenix in 1997, witnessed by a staggering 10,000+ people. How does their technology work, can Gregory give us more info on this?

A listener has been working towards her own enlightenment by giving up meat and becoming a Vegan, however the process has aggregated her arthritis. So, thinking about the information about the illness they went back and reintroduced white meat into their diet. So far, the joint pain has diminished in a big way but maybe her enlightenment possibilities have too. Can Gregory find out WHERE her enlightenment is going? 

And, being so ... what happens when people like in the Chilean air plain accident over the snow mountain picks a while ago, in order to survive had to practice cannibalism? I do not want to give Ideas to any one to have excuses to do this, finding a excuse in on an air answer. Would you think this is a question you can present in one of the programs. 

We also asked Gregory for an update on the financial situation. In these challenging times many people may start taking to the streets to protest, with many falling foul of the law or playing into the goverments hands. Gregory gave his advice on this situation.

And much more...

I would like to ask Gregory questions on Shambhala-firstly is there a rarefied place of this name constructed somewhere above our world-where great souls presumably like the Great White Brotherhood, Shining Ones etc exist to assist earth? 

Does Gregory live at times still in a personal space despite having to be so involved in helping so many- does he still retreat into beautiful places there for refreshment- or is it ceaseless benevolent activity on his part?

The listener also asked for an update on the strange build up and activity out in the Gulf of Mexico connected to many of the worlds subs being in the area.

Discussing the major sighting of a mile long craft over Phoenix in 1997, witnessed by a staggering 10,000+ people. How does their technology work, can Gregory give us more info on this?

A listener has been working towards her own enlightenment by giving up meat and becoming a Vegan, however the process has aggregated her arthritis. So, thinking about the information about the illness they went back and reintroduced white meat into their diet. So far, the joint pain has diminished in a big way but maybe her enlightenment possibilities have too. Can Gregory find out WHERE her enlightenment is going? 

And, being so ... what happens when people like in the Chilean air plain accident over the snow mountain picks a while ago, in order to survive had to practice cannibalism? I do not want to give Ideas to any one to have excuses to do this, finding a excuse in on an air answer. Would you think this is a question you can present in one of the programs. 

We also asked Gregory for an update on the financial situation. In these challenging times many people may start taking to the streets to protest, with many falling foul of the law or playing into the goverments hands. Gregory gave his advice on this situation.

And much more...

<title>Nigel Kerner - Greys Aliens and the Harvesting of Souls - New Research on The Shroud of Turin</title>
<itunes:author>Nigel Kerner, Dr Silverman, Professor John Biggerstaff</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Today's guest is Nigel Kerner, screenwriter, journalist, and author of "The Song of the Greys" and "Greys Aliens and the Harvesting of Souls". He is joined to discuss his shocking theory on the Grey alien presence with Dr Andrew Silerman and Associate Research Professor of Cell biology, John Biggerstaff. In the later part of the show Dr Andrew Silverman discusses new research that points to the Shroud of Turin being genuine.

From Wikipedia:
"The Shroud of Turin or Turin Shroud is a linen cloth bearing the image of a man who appears to have suffered physical trauma in a manner consistent with crucifixion. It is kept in the royal chapel of the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, northern Italy. Some contend that the shroud is the actual cloth placed on the body of Jesus Christ at the time of his burial, and that the face image is the Holy Face of Jesus"

Synopsis for Greys Aliens and the Harvesting of Souls

In 1997 Nigel Kerner first introduced the notion of aliens known as Greys coming to Earth, explaining that Greys are sophisticated biological robots created by an extraterrestrial civilization they have long since outlived. In this new book Kerner reveals that the Greys are seeking to master death by obtaining something humans possess that they do not: souls. Through the manipulation of human DNA, these aliens hope to create their own souls and, thereby, escape the entropic grip of the material universe in favour of the timeless realm of spirit. 

Kerner explains that genetic manipulation by the Greys has occurred since biblical times and has led to numerous negative qualities that plague humanity, such as violence, greed, and maliciousness. Racism, he contends, was developed by the aliens to prevent their genetic experiments from being compromised by breeding with others outside their influence. Examining historical records, Kerner shows that Jesus, who represented an uncorrupted genetic line, warned his disciples about the threat posed by these alien interlopers, while Hitler, a pure product of this alien intelligence, waged genocide in an attempt to rid Earth of all those untouched by this genetic tampering. Despite the powerful grip the Greys have on humanity, Kerner says that all hope is not lost. Greys exist wholly in the material world, so if we follow the spiritual laws of reincarnation and karma, aiming for enlightenment and rising above the material.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 32 - The Seat of the Soul, Venus Project, UFO Prediction Discussion</title>
<itunes:author>Gregory Haye, Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Topics Discussed: 'Are the dead all knowing?', 'Eyes, the Seat of the Soul?', 'UFO Prediction 13th Oct 2010 Discussion', 'The Venus Project', 'Positive Awakening Signs', 'John Lennon', 'Talking Animals'

Are the dead all knowing?

Spirit being Gregory and the White Cloud Group opened with a spontaneous address regarding people's perception of beings becoming all knowing when they pass over. His concern was that many people falsely believe that the departed become all knowing and pure love and light. He pointed out that this maybe the case for some beings that are already in tune with their pure essence. However for many who are still deeply entrenched in perhaps negative or ignorant behaviour, they will likely be exactly the same personality as before, and may hold on to exactly the same fears, dogma or prejudices as they did in the lifetime. It may take a great deal of work on their side of life to break down these barriers.

Are Eyes the Seat of the Soul
Gregory confirmed how this works from an energy spiritual level, along with how our Philosology then mirrors this through the eyes to reflect our state of being and health.

UFO Prediction 13th Oct 2010
Every year it seems an unsuspecting channeller is given a date that UFO Mother ships will appear over all our major cities. Last year a date was given to channeller Blossom Goodchild, who in her willingness to share such wonderful knowledge from a "light being", was left extremely embarrassed when none showed up. This year we have a retired NORAD officer who after consulting another channeller has been given the date of October the 13th to fill the same prophecy. The question put to Gregory is why would loving beings do this, especially if the ships never turn up anyway and people are left high and dry? Will it happen again?

The Venus Project - Jacque Fresco

We discussed the inspirational work by Jacque Fresco, founder of The Venus project. A listener asked about validity of this wondeful project, details regarding the Venus project are below. Gregory spoke in high regard of Jacque and endorsed his wonderful vision of the world

About the project:

"The Venus Project presents a bold, new direction for humanity that entails nothing less than the total redesign of our culture. There are many people today who are concerned with the serious problems that face our modern society: unemployment, violent crime, replacement of humans by technology, over-population and a decline in the Earth's ecosystems.

The Venus Project is dedicated to confronting all of these problems by actively engaging in the research, development, and application of workable solutions. Through the use of innovative approaches to social awareness, educational incentives, and the consistent application of the best that science and technology can offer directly to the social system, The Venus Project offers a comprehensive plan for social reclamation in which human beings, technology, and nature will be able to coexist in a long-term, sustainable state of dynamic equilibrium."

Positive Awakening Signs
We discussed the current increase in whistleblowers with more and more people coming forward to encourage positive change. Most of the power in the world comes from control of resources such as Oil, Ian wondered if Oil actually ran out (Some suggest there is peak oil) then the controllers would have no choice but to find a cleaner alternative, however Gregory pointed out that Oil will never run out as long as there are beings still living on the planet and within the Oceans. So his point is, we can't wait for Oil to run out to move onto something cleaner. The people who profit from it will just keep going.


And much more...

<title>Hazel Courteney Interview - Spiritual Emergency and Countdown to Coherence</title>
<itunes:author>Hazel Courteney, Mark Chatterton</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[On April 7th 1998, Sunday Times columnist Hazel Courteney, underwent an experience that was to change her life forever. She became telepathic, and began affecting electrical equipment. Most remarkable of all, however, was the realization that she could clearly hear spirits from the higher realms, and found herself receiving direct communication from Diana, Princess of Wales which she talks about in her book "Divine Intervention".

Interview conducted by host, Mark Chatterton.

About Hazel
Hazel Courteney has been writing about alternative health subjects for several years, after deciding to take charge of her own health, following years of illness. She has written for both The Daily Mail and the Sunday Times. In 1997 she was voted Health Journalist of the Year and in 2000 had her own TV show on Channel Health. 

In 1998 shortly before Easter, whilst shopping in Harrods, she had what she described as a Spiritual Emergency or Near Death Experience. Her first spiritual book, "Divine Intervention", published in 1999, described this event in detail, as well as the events that followed. In 2005, "Evidence For the Sixth Sense - Divine Intervention 2", was published, detailing the next few years of her life. Now in 2010, Hazel has just brought out her latest spiritual book, "Countdown to Coherence", which brings the story right up to date. The book contains interviews with several cutting edge scientists and spiritual teachers on how the gap between spirituality and science is being bridged, and how we can all become "coherent".

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 31 - Being-ness , Experiencing the Oneness, Raising our vibrational  
</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones, Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Topics Discussed: 
'Being-ness and experiencing the oneness', 'Identity and Ego', 'Infinite Universe', 'Celistine Prophecy - Raising our vibrational Index of Your Body', 'New Technology on the horizon', 'UFO Disclosure, UK Seal Mystery Explored'


Being-ness and experiencing the oneness.
Gregory discussed the state of being-ness and oneness that certain guru's / seekers achieve through raising their vibrational index. This allows them to change their metabolism so they no longer need to sustain themselves on heavy foods and can in fact live on a small leaf for example, or indeed just Light. He suggested that it's a state of being that's not easy to sustain. Most people would attain it as an experiment and return to a more grounded existence.

Identity and Ego
Would we lose our sense of who we are if we truly lost our identity or ego, is this something we would truly wish to attain? What does it mean to lose our ego?

Infinite Universe
Was there a beginning? Is our universe just a grain of sand in an infinite collection of universes that make up the multiverse, which had always existed?

Celistine Prophecy - Raising our vibrational Index of Your Body
We discussed the concept of raising our vibrational index to phase out of this reality or disappear much like the characters at t

he end of the book, Celestine Prophecy.

New Technology on the horizon
Blindness could be cured using existing eye tissue.
A persons thoughts could be read and visually displayed by technology in the near future or even now using radio waves.
Even transporting matter is becoming possible now, which could eventually lead to the beam me up Scotty scenario.

Is Technology at odds with spirituality or can it be used in balance?

Gregory also discussed the dangers of suing Blue Tooth and the effects of Microwaves used by mobile phones and masts being built near schools. There is a real danger here, so people should limit use of Blue Tooth headsets and mobile phones, especially children.

UFO Disclosure 
Disclosure is now happening more and more, with it even being taken a bit more seriously by the main stream media. Gregory confirmed that this is set to continue, with UFO displays will happen that the governments won't be able to explain away.

UK Seal Mystery Explored
Gregory explored two concerns around the Seals. There are those that are being killed by "others" that are not from here, however we are also impacting on them through fertilisers that run off into the sea.

All these subjects are covered in depth within the show. Do tune in and have a listen.

And much more...

Being-ness and experiencing the oneness.
Gregory discussed the state of being-ness and oneness that certain guru's / seekers achieve through raising their vibrational index. This allows them to change their metabolism so they no longer need to sustain themselves on heavy foods and can in fact live on a small leaf for example, or indeed just Light. He suggested that it's a state of being that's not easy to sustain. Most people would attain it as an experiment and return to a more grounded existence.

Identity and Ego
Would we lose our sense of who we are if we truly lost our identity or ego, is this something we would truly wish to attain? What does it mean to lose our ego?

Infinite Universe
Was there a beginning? Is our universe just a grain of sand in an infinite collection of universes that make up the multiverse, which had always existed?

Celistine Prophecy - Raising our vibrational Index of Your Body
We discussed the concept of raising our vibrational index to phase out of this reality or disappear much like the characters at t

he end of the book, Celestine Prophecy.

New Technology on the horizon
Blindness could be cured using existing eye tissue.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 30 - HAARP, New Zealand Quake, Ultraverse, Channelling, Tesla</title>
<itunes:author>Gregory Haye and Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Topics discussed in the show: HAARP, New Zealand Quake, UK Magnitude 8 Earth Quake Drill, Nikola Tesla, Free Energy, Animal Mutilations, Channelling, ultraverse, Autism, Question on Shifting Consciousness. 

Just some of the questions asked by our listeners:

Duality
Most people on Earth want peace and is without doubt something that we should all continue to focus on and bring about. However we have to be realistic that we are part of a duality universe / ultraverse, where there exists Physical and Non Physical Beings operating in either polarity, exactly like humans do on Earth. It is a little naive to assume that all beings in this infinite universe mean well, positive aligned beings would in the most part not choose to interfere with us or break our free will, but only guide us when it's right to do so within humanities collective consciousness or progression. 

Humans have to be very careful at this time in Earth's history, as not all beings are positive. People should test their integrity in the same way that you would a total stranger who wishes to enter your house offering you amazing gifts. Discernment is a skill that needs be learnt and tested over many years. The universe is an amazing playground for spiritual growth and new experiences, as we learn to open up to new energies we should use caution and discernment as this is a much more rewarding and beneficial gift to have. Happy playing.

Questions:
"I live in Christchurch and we all had an unpleasant experience. Although New Zealand is part of the "ring of fire" Christchurch in the south island is the least expected place that 

one would expect an earthquake to happen compared to other parts in NZ. It happened along a small insignificant fault line which was close to the major fault line. Would Gregory be able to shed some light on this? Was the spirit world aware that this was going to happen? Or could something more sinister like the HAARP that could have caused this devastating experience."

"Thank you for asking the question regarding the horrific seal deaths around the coast; the injuries are certainly less complex than the mysterious, highly scientific injuries found in other animal mutilations seen worldwide - EG bloodless corpses - whole body parts missing - see Silent Killers video, and work of APFU-who investigate this phenomena; as a vegan I have no sympathy with the farmers involved - only the creatures brutalised; this has been observed since the fifties - maybe longer. The observers notice generally red orbs, beams, smaller white orbs at such events. It is not just animals like sheep cows- its all sorts found with the same injuries, and well documented by very sound people. Incidentally although some teachers indicates that most aliens are positive Gregory told me that one species definitely wants our earth; I personally believe some could feign altruism to get what they want from us , but naturally hope there are others who truly watch with compassion - I had asked Gregory how can we tell that sophisticated other species mean well ; if they are so far ahead of us - maybe they could fool us with what seems like compassionate love - do a few miracles etc- having said that I hope too there exist some truly good ones - on our side so to speak."
And much more...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 29 - Duality, Economy, Ego, Seals Mystery, Jet Stream, Creation of Life</title>
<itunes:author>Gregory Haye and Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show we covered the following questions sent in by our listeners. Please use the comment box underneath this page to send in any future questions.

Topics: Mutilated Seals Mystery, Jet Stream and Extreme Weather, Duality, Economy Collapse Engineered? Does Ego cross over?, Creation of life. Millions of dead fish being washed up.

Is the economic crisis being engineered by the powers that be or is it simply collapsing underneath its own weight, much like the Roman Empire?

Do spirit beings still have their ego when they cross over or is it something only used in the physical life?

Do spirits get involved in creating new species of life on Earth, or is it only managed on the Earth through genetics?

Scientists say that the current bad weather is caused by a dramatic change in the Jet Stream, is this caused by Global Warming or by changes on the Sun or both?

What is causing the mysterious deaths of the Seals on the Norfolk coast, where they have been found with strange cork screw injuries?

Some people talk about duality which seems to explain why we have such polarizing negative and positive experiences on Earth, is this a true assumption? Will we never get 100% good experiences or 100% negatives playing out on Earth? Or can the negativity or positivity completely take over?

And much more...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 28 - Spiritual Growth, Life Review, Clones and Soul, Chemtrails, Healing</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In to today's show we covered the following questions sent in by our listeners. Please use the comment box underneath this page to send in any future questions.

Topics: Is spiritual growth through pain necessary? : Do clones have souls?: Chemtrails real?, Healing questions: Oil Spill update, is it fixed? : Do we all choose this life before we are born? : Life Review, Recompense and Reconciliation with other entities.

Questions:

If we are in the physical life for growth, then why is growth so painful and most of the time we get more pain (emotionally) than good?

Do spirits choose the location and circumstance of their life on Earth before they are born?

Is the BP oil spill fixed now as the US government are now suggesting that most of the oil has dissipated?

When people such as Richard Dawkins, and others state everything we experience is due to our brains, and we are just gene machines, what would Gregory say to someone such as Dawkins to convince them we are not deluded by thinking ourselves eternal? 

Also with reference to Dolly the sheep where does the soul of something artificially created come in? 

Has Gregory told us yet what chemtrails really are?

I have been taught that the primary purpose of healing is to touch the soul, would Gregory kindly explain about this? 

When people seek spiritual healing is it for physical pain or mental anguish that they are aware of, or does their soul also have a say in bringing them for healing? 

Is the purpose of giving healing to the soul to educate, to heal? 

Why is an earthly being helpful in healing the soul when the healing is I assume, 'spirit to spirit'?

And much more...

<title>Ian Lawton Interview - Future of the Soul - Shift in Consciousness</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Lawton/ Mark Chatterton</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Interview with author and researcher Ian Lawton, hosted by Mark Chatterton for TheSpiritGuides.co.uk

Ian Lawton, born in 1959, is the author of several spiritual books. He is also the architect of the notion of Rational Spirituality. After gaining a degree in Economics from University College, London and qualifying as a chartered accountant, he sold computer software for several years before, in the late eighties, helping to found a business and IT consultancy company. 

In his mid-thirties he forsook the commercial world to become a writer-researcher specializing in ancient history, esoterica and spiritual philosophy. His first two books, Giza: The Truth and Genesis Unveiled (2003), have sold over 30,000 copies worldwide. In The Book of the Soul (2004) he first developed the idea of Rational Spirituality, also establishing himself as one of the world's leading authorities on the interlife. And in The Wisdom of the Soul (2007) he first introduced the idea of the holographic soul. 

His other books include The Little Book of the Soul (2007), The Big Book of the Soul (2008, a complete rewrite of the 2004 book), Your Holographic Soul (2010) and The Future of the Soul (2010). The next two books planned are and The History of the Soul (a revision of the 2003 book) and Autobiography of an Angel (a debut historical novel). 

Ian has just completed the first stage of his training as a hypnotherapist, and has set up a practice at his home in Bournemouth. He also creates artwork using driftwood collected from local Dorset beaches.

In the interview with Mark Chatterton, Ian Lawton talks about his books and how he became a full time writer. He talks about his research into Reincarnation, Karma and Past Life Regression, which he has written about in his "Soul books". He also talks about his latest book, "The Future of the Soul", which deals with the whole concept of 2012, the expansion of consciousness and the whole future of the planet. 

IAN LAWTON INTERVIEW QUESTIONS - 9/8/2010

You previously had a career in IT and accountancy. What made you turn your back on the 9 to 5 and become a writer?

Had you any religious background before all this?

Your first book, "Giza The Truth", was on the Egyptian pyramids. What made you choose that as a subject for a book?

Did you get much reaction from the more traditional academics?

I understand that it sold over 20,000 copies. Not bad for a first book?

Could you tell us a little bit about your second book, "Genesis Unveiled"?

So would you say that you believe that was a place on Earth in the past called Atlantis?

So by now your views on spirituality had changed so much that you came up with the notion of "Rational Spirituality"?

What do you mean by this?

In your third book, "The Book of The Soul", you argued the case for both reincarnation and karma. Would you say your own experiences of past life regression helped shaped your views?

You decided to publish this book yourself. I'm surprised that none of the big publishers were interested in publishing it?

Did you get any comeback from the academic world on the book of the soul?

By now you had established the idea of an afterlife through the evidence of past life regression, but you and the regressors went back even further to the notion of an interlife. This notion was discussed more fully your next book, "The Wisdom of the Soul", Can you explain a little more about this concept?

What about the notion of the holographic soul?

You then decided to rewrite the Book of the Soul, bringing it out in a short version, "The Little Book of the Soul" and a much longer version, "The Big Book of the Soul". What was your thinking behind this?

Now in 2010, you have just bought out the next book in the "Soul book" series, "The Future of the Soul". Can you tell the listeners about his book?

Would you agree that this is a radical departure from your previous books, which were based on scientific observation of regressionists at work, whilst this latest book is based more on channelling?

What's the reaction been like for "The Future of the Soul"?

What's your take on the whole 2012 debate?

Finally, what's next in pipeline from Ian Lawton?

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 27 - Gulf Oil Spill Update New Cap, Listener Questions, Economy</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show Gregory and the group covered the following questions below, with additional questions injected from the host to dig deeper. Gregory also discussed the Gulf of Mexico oil spill at the end of show, where he raised concern around the new cap to stem the flow, apparently this is building up extra pressures that are now allowing fissures to open up on the sea floor which can spread the leak. 

Question 1:
"Thank you all for the program, I love listening very much. I am a healer practitioner. When will things get better, Gregory.  Everyone I talk too!  Seem to be in turmoil and things happening to them shootings, stabbings the news also full of it.  "
Question 2:
"I have been a healer for many years, love my work and love my healing guides. I would so appreciate understanding how to improve my ability to 'converse' with my guides so as to improve my intuitive sensitivity and improve my ability to be a vessel for healing. Could Gregory please suggest a way to break down a little the barrier between an instrument such as myself and spirit guides."

Question 3:
"What fate lies for Europe's economy now we are coming out of one of the deepest recessions for many decades?"

Question 4:
"My question today is: Although I realize events are "fluid" and mass consciousness plays a role, what is the likelihood of a planetary "axis shift", and if there would be a dramatic shift is there a chance we would enter a "parallel earth reality" while this is happening?? Any insight would be helpful. I ask this as I know in various places there is a storage/keeping of seeds in huge vaults as if some governments are expecting something huge to happen, as in huge natural planetary shift that will wipe out food sources for awhile."

And much more...

<itunes:subtitle>In today's show Gregory and the group covered the following questions below, with additional questions injected from the host to dig deeper. Gregory also discussed the Gulf of Mexico oil spill at the end of show, where he raised concern around the new cap to stem the flow, apparently this is building up extra pressures that are now allowing fissures to open up on the sea floor which can spread the leak. 

Question 1:
"Thank you all for the program, I love listening very much. I am a healer practitioner. When will things get better, Gregory.  Everyone I talk too!  Seem to be in turmoil and things happening to them shootings, stabbings the news also full of it. "
Question 2:
"I have been a healer for many years, love my work and love my healing guides. I would so appreciate understanding how to improve my ability to 'converse' with my guides so as to improve my intuitive sensitivity and improve my ability to be a vessel for healing. Could Gregory please suggest a way to break down a little the barrier between an instrument such as myself and spirit guides."

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 26 - Spirit World Questions, Ark of Covenant, Stonehenge, Oil Update </title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Gulf Oil Spill Update
Gregory discussed the many issues that the dispersants will have on the region, with high levels toxicity in the water and environment. 


Mars
Discussion on the time window for supportable life on Mars which was formed around 4.6 billion years ago but lost its atmosphere and magnetosphere around 4 billion years ago, leaving a small window for life; however Mars was a vibrant planet with oceans at that time.

Ark of the Covenant
We discussed the story of the Ark of Covenant, alleged to have been used by Moses during the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt. Some people describe the Ark as some kind of God like instrument and others simply suggest it was more a weapon of mass destruction. It's now rumoured to be in Ethiopia. Gregory was very apprehensive talking about the object which could be an indication that the object was not what many people believe it to be. People still hold it in high regard as an instrument of God and may not readily accept it being anything but. Anyhow, whatever it was, if in fact it did exist, it was way beyond the technologies of the people supposedly living at that time.

Ethiopia
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant
http://exodus2006.com/theark.htm
 
 
Unknown binary star or planets orbiting our sun theory.
It's a common mystery within in the new age community that there may be another unknown binary star or planet orbiting our Sun that some claim could be planet X or Nibiru. Gregory understood and respected why people believed in this theory but from the groups own research they haven't come across such an object. Gregory discussed his reason why.

Stonehenge
What was the purpose of Stonehenge?

Gregory gave a comprehensive account of what the Stonehenge was used for, how it is also connected to the many Ley lines in the area. The main purpose seems to have been for healing and helping those that had passed into the next world. A ritual performed by the druids. Because of its location and use of particular stones the energy in that location is very powerful. Many churches and cathedrals are also built along the many Ley lines to utilise the same energies.

Pyramids
We also discussed the use of pyramids.


Spirit World
Gregory gave us some wonderful answers to the following questions.

How does a spirit know that a family friend is about to visit a medium and connect with them?

How does that process work from the spirit side?

Do spirit people live in houses?

Is there music in the spirit world?

Are there more colours in Spirit?

Do people spend time with family groups?

Do Spirit rest or sleep?

Do children grow up in spirit slowly or do they appear is they were before they left?

What age do most people project themselves to be in the spirit world?

Do spirits still eat?

Can not letting go of somebody that has passed for a long period of time hold the spirit person back on their journey?

And much more...

To ask a question for our next show, please leave a comment.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 25 - Unicorns, Listener Questions, Miracles</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show we discussed the following topics:

Unicorns, Elementals, Different Earth Races, Helping Others, Miracles, Psychic Surgery, Oil Update, Mar's Moon Phobos as an ancient dwelling and Oceans in Space.

We also covered the following questions from our listeners this week:

Listener 1:
"Ian - thanks for today's show. It has resonated particularly with me. The notion that those in spirit are not by definition 'higher' than us is something I had not considered and, in my work as a healer, this kind of elevates one's position to an equal member of the human/spirit healing team - not in a bad way but in a way that I feel to be very helpful.

One question for Gregory, if you can, please. 
He stresses that one does not have to come back to the earth plane to experience all that must be experienced - one can gain this experience from others in spirit. Some of us come back to earth to help others with their journey. 

Many earth people don't have the least understanding of their spiritual journey, however. 

Are they back here to help others achieve scenarios for those others to experience or what - I don't understand why they have come back if they could have learnt what they need in the spirit world.

Hope my question is clear! Thank you for these shows, Ian - they are always illuminating, interesting and educational."

Listener 2:
"I have a couple of questions for Gregory if you have a chance... 
What is his opinion of psychic surgeons? 
(The ones that look like they are actually doing surgery on the patient). 

Also has he met any unicorns, what is the best way to contact them? 

Do miracles really happen, if so are people chosen to have miracles? 
Many thanks and absolutely love the show. "

Listener 3:
"

Excellent show once again team. 

There are 2 burning questions I have. 

One is why do we have different races on earth such as black, white and asian? 

Also, is there a law to stop spirit guides helping in crime investigations such a Madeleine McCann? 
Thank you. "

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 24 - Gulf Oil Spill, Indigenous People, Tipping Point, E.T Guides</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Oil Spill - Gulf of Mexico
We spent the beginning of the show discussing the ongoing catastrophic oil spill spreading across the Gulf of Mexico, discussing how much is leaking and whether humans can fix the problem.

Also the environmental impact on an already-near-dead sea. The US Government and local states really need to take back control of the situation from BP to get a handle on the true extend of the problem.

Indigenous Groups / Native People
Gregory discussed the plight of the young people from the many indigenous groups around the world who are being left behind and neglected as we continually strive for a western approach to living in an already materialistic and out-of-balance world. Many of these lost peoples are turning to alcohol and drugs to get through the loss of their sacred lands and culture. Many elders have spoken about a future prophecy where a day of purification would come if the US government doesn't include them in talks and help bring balance to modern life. Gregory compares the Day of Purification prophecy to the tipping point that he has mentioned before that could in fact happen if we don't change the way we are treating the environment and each other.

Gregory provided some answers to the following questions:

Do E.T's (Long thin Grays) have spirit guides?

Why do we have to forget who we are when we are born, is this normal?

Gregory spoke in one of the last shows that it's more common for souls / spirits to have a non physical experience and that it's not essential to have a physical life.

It can cloak the spirit in negative energies and distortions. This begged the question, why would souls want to come to Earth then? Why would we put ourselves through the sometimes harsh experiences to come here at all?

Gregory provided some answers to the following questions:

Do E.T's (Long thin Grays) have spirit guides?

Why do we have to forget who we are when we are born, is this normal?

Gregory spoke in one of the last shows that it's more common for souls / spirits to have a non physical experience and that it's not essential to have a physical life.

It can cloak the spirit in negative energies and distortions. This begged the question, why would souls want to come to Earth then? Why would we put ourselves through the sometimes harsh experiences to come here at all?

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 23 - Noah's Ark, Icleland Volcano, Phobos, Ongoing Disclosure, Questions</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Iceland Volcano
We discussed the large volcanic eruption in Iceland recently and what Gregory's thoughts were on the increase in changes that are happening world wide, are they part of 2012 heading towards a huge crescendo or part of a natural cycle that the Earth goes through from time to time. We also discussed the previous large eruption back in 1783 where 20,000 farm workers were killed due to dangerous sulphuric gases choking people in many parts of Britain. Could something like that happen again?

Noah's Ark
We discussed the discovery many years ago of satellite photo that seemed to depict Noah's ark or a large boat perched on top of mount Ararat in Turkey. Could this really be the boat mentioned in the Bible. Christian explorers recently made their way up the mountain where they took samples which seemed to confirm that this indeed could be the Ark. Gregory confirmed that this was indeed the Ark and the actual event that took. A very interesting perspective.

More on UFO / Alien Disclosure
There have been more and more reports in the mainstream indicating that extraterrestrial life could be out there on other moons and planets in our solar system, albeit at the microscopic level. However in some small way it does appear to be pushing humanity in the right direction to change our mass thinking on the subject. 

Even Stephen Hawking as come out saying that by his own mathematical calculation E.T life has to exist and we should be very cautious about making contact with them as they may wish to come here to squander our resources much like what humans do. Also Buzz Aldrin the NASA astronaut has been actively pushing for an exploration of Mar's moon Phobos, which he says has a large E.T based monolith. There does seem to be a push at some kind of level of disclosure or a more open mindset. Gregory agreed this was indeed the case and gave his perspective on the subject.

3rd and 4th Generation Night Vision Goggles
We discussed the many sightings that people have seen in the upper atmosphere of many large unconventional UFO type craft zipping around at incredible speeds beyond the visible light spectrum. People who have 3rd generation or 4th generation military grade night vision goggles are apparently seeing these things quite openly moving about. Is there a secret space program, battle between different advanced groups or guardians protecting the Earth? Gregory did agree......
More info here:www. edgrimsley.com

The last past of the show Gregory answered some listener questions below:

1. How many lives has Gregory had and is Area 51 real?

2. A listener woke up one morning with a loud voice saying the numbers 888, she wanted know if they had any meaning for her and what they could mean.

And much more...]]></description>

<title>Leaving the world of duality and Letting Go with JC Mac</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / JC Mac</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Today's guest is JC Mac. We apologies for the sound quality in places which was due to the conversation being recorded over a mobile broadband device rather than a fixed landline connection, but hey that's the amazing thing about technology, you can speak to anybody anywhere. 

Anyhow, JC has an amazing story to tell regarding his own first hand experience stepping outside of the confines of duality and experiencing ALL THAT IS, beyond linear time and space, basically the true you, me I, what...... It's hard to describe without putting a label on it. 

Anyway here is JC's info below but please do check out the show and hear it from him first hand. Enjoy Xx Ian
(Click play on the audio player above)

What Happened

On August 15th 2005 while hanging up the phone one day JC suddenly began crying for no reason and could not stop. As the crying continued a sensation of pins and needles and rushing water began to move down through his head and up through his arms and legs. The experience became so intense he ended up on the floor believing he was about to die from either a stroke or a heart attack. 

The fear of death consumed him and in a last desperate attempt he began to chant and pray. As the experience intensified he remembered a saying from one of his teaches, "all fear is illusion walk straight ahead" so he began to surrendered more and more. Then like a set of falling dominos he let go of everything in life. First he surrendered his body and mind then his children, his business, everything he had accomplished through out his life, his family, friends, the past the future and finally the fear of death itself. Then just as quickly as the energy had consumed him it disappeared, leaving him in a state of what he can only describe as a living silent still bliss and a peace beyond anything he could have ever imagined. 

The state was so intense that he continued to cry almost every day for the next year while witnessing the absolute beauty of what he now knows as the love of God. The experience left him unable to function in normal life and even the smallest of tasks became cumbersome and difficult. All thinking disappeared for extended periods resulting in the inability to eat, wash, move and speak.

The world of time and space disappeared, movement slowed down and all things radiated and communicated the energy of all of life. Nothing had any more importance or value than anything else and there was no longer a hierarchy or separation to life, everything was exactly how it was supposed to be, in a state of absolute perfection. After some years of integration the state began to settle and he was able to rejoin the world and function for the benefit of the highest good. The perception and noise of linear life was replaced by a silent still awareness that remains with him to this day.]]></description>

The state was so intense that he continued to cry almost every day for the next year while witnessing the absolute beauty of what he now knows as the love of God. The experience left him unable to function in normal life and even the smallest of tasks became cumbersome and difficult. All thinking disappeared for extended periods resulting in the inability to eat, wash, move and speak.

The world of time and space disappeared, movement slowed down and all things radiated and communicated the energy of all of life. Nothing had any more importance or value than anything else and there was no longer a hierarchy or separation to life, everything was exactly how it was supposed to be, in a state of absolute perfection. After some years of integration the state began to settle and he was able to rejoin the world and function for the benefit of the highest good. The perception and noise of linear life was replaced by a silent still awareness that remains with him to this day.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 22 - Autism, Foods and chemicals - EVP Ghost Boxes - Listener Q and A - Spiritual Knowledge</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Today's show was put together from recent feedback provided by our listeners.

Topics discussed:  Autism in conjunction with Foods and chemicals, Ghost Boxes or EVP devices, Philadelphia Experiment feedback, Affects of Radio Waves, WI-FI and Micro Waves on our children. Gregory's Thirst for Spiritual Knowledge, is it normal for beings in spirit to know so much?.

Listener Question:
"Over the months of listening in to your broadcasts, I have become fascinated by the beautiful and wise soul Gregory. Gregory may not be happy talking about himself but I would love to know a little more about him. His range of knowledge is so huge - both of spiritual matters and current and past events on earth, to the extent of knowing the current activities of those who have now passed to spirit. 

Can Gregory explain the following?

"Is it normal for a highly evolved spirit to have such a range of knowledge of understanding or does he have a particular thirst for knowledge or, indeed, is the knowledge of others instantly available to him to tap into to enable him to respond so wisely and fully to your wide-ranging questions?

Is it usual for those in spirit to keep themselves informed of what is currently happening on the earth plane?

What is the nature of his work in spirit?

In the last broadcast, Gregory mentioned that certain food groups eaten by pregnant women could result in autism or mental imbalance in the baby - would or could he explain which food groups are responsible, please?"

<b>EVP - Ghost Boxes</b>
Toys R Us in the US have been selling Ouija Boards marketed specially for children, kitted out in pink boxes to lure youngsters to play with them. Even more worrying is the advent of the Ghost Box which is an EVP device much like a radio. You basically ask it a question and then quite spookily an answer will come back to you  through the white noise generated by the device. 

Gregory raised serious concerns using  such a mechanism to connect with spirit and your guides. The bottom line is, the only type of beings you're going to connect with are of a negative nature. Your spirit guides and love one's would never come through in this way. The issue is that the being will try to impress you by building your trust but its ultimate goal is to attach itself to you and then gain power by putting you through fearful situations. 

And much more...]]></description>

<title>Pea Horsley - Heartwarming stories from the lady who communicates with animals</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Pea Horsley</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Today's guest is Pea Horsley, professional animal communicator and author of Heart to Heart published by Harper Collins.

Listen to Pea's heart-warming stories of animal communication as she tracks lost animals, tackles troublesome pets and helps people to truly understand their devoted friends.

Pea Horsley never set out to be an animal psychic, so you can imagine her surprise when she not only realised that animals could talk, but that she could hear them.

Touching and funny, Pea describes how she learnt to harness her powers and, in doing so, the incredible characters that she meets - on two legs and four. Pea tells how she saved Musgo the horse who was unable to recover from a past trauma, helped a client find her reincarnated puppy, and the wonderful story of Mono the dog and his owner, Mike. Mono had saved Mike's life, so when the vet told Mike that Mono was so ill that there was no hope, Mike refused to give up on him. Pea came to the rescue to help Mono tell Mike what he needed to survive.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 21 - Meaning of Life, Philadelphia Experiment, Nature vs Nature</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Summary of topics discussed:
"The Meaning of Life," "The Self, Personality, Nature vs. Nature, Multiple Personalities", "Attraction and Love", "Autism in Animals", "Healing", "The Cove - Slaughter of Dolphins in Japan to feed Children", "Philadelphia Experiment", "Cycles, 7 Year Cycles", "Free vs. Destiny"

The Meaning of Life
Gregory gave a very simple answer to this question which was "Experience" but then followed with a very comprehensive answer relative to the whole universe rather than just answering from a human perspective. 

The Self, Personality and Nature vs. Nature / Multiple Personalities
We then touched on the topic of Self, and how personalities are defined, is it Nature vs. Nature? and also how we are also made up of our Spirit/Soul self.

Attraction - Love
We also discussed how Love and Attraction works, it's as much a biological response as spiritual

Autism in Animals
We also discussed the rise in Autism in pets who have been given vaccinations, this raises an interesting parallel seen amongst humans. Especially as the big drug companies have aggressively denied any such links and come down heavily on anybody highlighting the issue. The following piece was taken from a recent Daily Mail article highlighting the increase in autism amongst pets given vaccinations.

Daily Mail: 
Vaccines given to dogs are making them ill, a pet charity claimed yesterday. 

Profit-hungry drug companies and vets are 'frightening' dog owners into inoculating their pets more often than necessary, according to Canine Health Concern. 

Some puppies have developed conditions including autism and epilepsy after a raft of injections, it warns. 

Catherine O'Driscoll, from the charity, said: 'We are not anti-vaccination. What we are saying is that currently our pets are receiving far too many. 

'The latest scientific research shows that after the first course of injections as a puppy most dogs are immune against these diseases for at least seven years, if not for life. 

'Every year pet vaccination companies hold National Vaccination Month, a national campaign when pet owners whose boosters have lapsed by 18 months or more are terrified into having their pet jabbed. 

'While the vast majority of vets might simply not be aware of the latest scientific research, we are concerned that for a few undoubtedly doing multiple jabs is a way of making more money from worried pet owners.' 

Puppies are vaccinated against distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus, leptospirosis and parainfluenza up to three times by the age of four months. 

They may also be immunised against coronavirus, rabies, Lyme disease and bordetella or kennel cough. Booster shots are given every year or every three or four years. 

But some have suffered dramatic changes in behaviour or been diagnosed with cancer within months of the injections, Canine Health Concern says. 

In a letter backed by 17 vets and other pet experts, the charity has called on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, which monitors animal vaccines, to issue new advice on their use. 

Mrs O'Driscoll, who believes cats and rabbits could also be at risk, added that a simple blood test would determine whether an animal needed a booster shot. 

Richard Allport, a Hertfordshire vet who has signed the letter to the VMD, said he was 'constantly' seeing animals that had developed 'worrying symptoms' after vaccination. 

But other animal charities said vaccination was vital. The Dogs Trust said all jabs were thoroughly tested for safety and warned that blood tests were not completely reliable. Its veterinary director, Chris Laurence, said a study looking for a connection between jabs and sudden ill-health failed to find a link. 

Professor Steve Dean, chief executive of the VMD, said: 'Many veterinary surgeons can remember the devastating effects these once common-diseases had on our pets, their owners and families, and the huge benefit vaccines have had on improving the health and welfare of the canine population should be recognised.' 

A spokesman added that the 80million-plus doses of vaccine since 1985 had generated fewer than 7,000 reports of side effects.

Cycles
We discussed the topic of Cycles of energy where the drama of life seems to have different themes. We also touched on the seven year cycle that humans have where big changes can take place within the person, especially around the middle years.

Healing
We discussed the different methods of healing and how energy is used by the sender and recipient to help promote healing in the body. Also how a tipping can be reached where no healing can take place as the body is too far compromised. 

The Cove - Slaughter of Dolphins in Japan to fed Children
In Japan, fishermen round up and slaughter hundreds and even thousands of dolphins and other small whales each year. 

In the small fishing village of Taiji, entire schools of dolphins are driven into a hidden cove after a prolonged chase. Once trapped inside the cove, the fishermen kill the dolphins, slashing their throats with knives or stabbing them with spears. The water turns red with their blood, and the air fills with their screams.

This brutal massacre - the largest scale dolphin kill in the world - goes on for six months of every year. Even more scandalous, members of the international dolphin display industry take advantage of the dolphin slaughter to obtain some few, show-quality dolphins for use in captive dolphin shows and dolphin swim programs. 

It is commonly assumed that Japanese fishermen hunt dolphins to supply a small minority of Japanese people with dolphin meat. But unlike the expensive whale meat, dolphin meat is not considered a delicacy in Japan, and the real reason the Japanese government issues permits to kill dolphins by the thousands every year has nothing to do with food culture. It has to do with pest control. As shocking as it sounds, some Japanese government officials view dolphins as pests to be eradicated in huge numbers. During a meeting at Taiji City Hall, the fishermen of Taiji admitted this to us. "We don't kill the dolphins primarily for their meat. We kill them as a form of pest control," they told us. In other words, killing the competition is their way of preserving the ocean's fish for themselves.

Most likely in order to push the food culture issue even further, the Japanese government recently introduced pilot whale meat to children's school lunch programs, despite the fact that the meat is tainted with mercury and not fit for human consumption. The Japanese government and the dolphin hunters do not warn the Japanese people of this danger, although the dolphin meat should be labelled as toxic. Much of the tainted dolphin meat ends up as counterfeit whale meat in Tokyo and other large cities. 

Science has established that dolphins are highly intelligent and complex marine mammals. How can "pest control" on dolphins continue with so little opposition from the Japanese people and the outside world? The answer is secrecy. Since we first travelled to Japan in 2003 to document the dolphin hunt and expose it to the world, the fishermen have become increasingly paranoid about being photographed and filmed. Today, they hide the dolphin slaughter behind barbed wire, ropes and tarpaulin. Killing the dolphins before daylight breaks, they station guards at the mouth of the killing cove to ensure that no one witnesses the blood bath. 

The fishermen say they kill the dolphins "quickly and humanely." That's an outright lie. The methods used to kill the dolphins are so savage, it's hard to believe it unless you witness it for yourself. And once you've seen it, the images and sounds of the screaming dolphins never go away. The fishermen know that the world will be outraged when the truth gets out. And so, guided by their government, they hide behind phrases such as "food culture" and "tradition." They even once told us they are proud of what they do. If they had told us they were having fun while killing dolphins, we would have believed them. We have heard them laugh out loud as they were throwing spears at the dolphins and hauling them ashore with ropes, or dragging still live dolphins by their tail flukes to be slaughtered. If they were really proud of this, then why do they go to such extreme measures hiding it? Why won't they even let their own people know about the hunt? We asked them this once, and the answer was: "It is none of their business." But it is their business. The Japanese people have every right to know about the dolphin slaughter. And they have a right to know about the mercury-poisoned dolphin meat that is being fed to their children.

Philadelphia Experiment
Gregory confirmed that the following experiment did actually take place.

We discussed the subject of the "Philadelphia Experiment" which was rumoured to have taken place in the year 1943 and later made into a Hollywood film depicting the dematerialisation of US Navy ship the USS Eldridge. The ship and its crew were suddenly thrown through time and space, with two crew members apparently popping out into 1983. Many of the crew members became tragically embedded in the ships exterior on its return. 

The Story:

The story begins in June of 1943, with the Destroyer Escort, U.S.S. Eldridge, DE-173, being fitted with tons of experimental electronic equipment. This included, according to one source, two massive generators of 75 KVA each, mounted where the forward gun turret would have been, distributing their power through four magnetic coils mounted on the deck. Three RF transmitters (2 megawatt CW each, mounted on the deck), three thousand "6L6" power amplifier tubes (used to drive the field coils of the two generators), special synchronizing and modulation circuits, and a host of other specialized hardware were employed to generate massive electromagnetic fields which, when properly configured, would be able to bend light and radio waves around the ship, thus making it invisible to enemy observers.

The "experiment," said to have taken place at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and also at sea, took place on at least one occasion while in full view of the Merchant Marine ship S.S. Andrew Furuseth, and other observation ships. The S.S. Andrew Furuseth becomes significant because one of its crewmen is the source of most of the original material making up the PX legend. Carlos Miguele Allende, also known as (A.K.A.) Carl Michael Allen, wrote a series of strange letters to one Dr. Morris K. Jessup in the 1950's in which he described what he claims to have witnessed: at least one of the several phases of the 
Philadelphia Experiment.

At 0900 hours, on July 22nd, 1943, the power to the generators was turned on, and the massive electromagnetic fields started to build up. A greenish fog was seen to slowly envelop the ship, concealing it from view. Then the fog itself is said to have disappeared, taking the U.S.S. Eldridge with it, leaving only undisturbed water where the ship had been anchored only moments before.

The elite officers of the U.S. Navy and scientists involved gazed in awe at their greatest achievement: the ship and crew were not only radar invisible but invisible to the eye as well! Everything worked as planned, and about fifteen minutes later they ordered the men to shut down the generators. The greenish fog slowly reappeared, and the U.S.S. Eldridge began to re-materialize as the fog subsided, but it was evident to all that something had gone wrong.

When boarded by personnel from shore, the crewmembers above decks were disoriented and nauseous. The U.S. Navy removed the crew from that original experiment, and shortly afterward, obtained another crew for a second experiment. In the end, the U.S. Navy decided that they only wanted to achieve radar invisibility, and the equipment was altered.

On the 28th of October in 1943, at 17:15, the final test on the U.S.S. Eldridge was performed. The electromagnetic field generators were turned on again, and the U.S.S. Eldridge became nearly invisible. Only a faint outline of the hull remained visible in the water. Everything was fine for the first few seconds, and then, in a blinding blue flash, the ship completely vanished. Within seconds it reappeared hundreds of miles away, in Norfolk, Virginia, and was seen for several minutes. The U.S.S. Eldridge then disappeared from Norfolk as mysteriously as it had arrived, and reappeared back in Philadelphia Naval Yard. This time most of the sailors were violently sick. Some of the crew were simply "missing" never to return. Some of the crew went crazy. The strangest result of all of this experiment was that five men were found fused to the metal within the ship's structure.

The men that survived were never the same again. Those that lived were discharged as "mentally unfit" for duty, regardless of their true condition.

So, what had begun as an experiment in electronic camouflage, ended up as an accidental teleportation of an entire ship and crew, to a distant location and back again, all in a matter of minutes!

Although the above may seem fantastic, one must remember, that in the 1940's the atomic bomb was also being invented.

We also discussed how Love and Attraction works, it's as much a biological response as spiritual

Autism in Animals
We also discussed the rise in Autism in pets who have been given vaccinations, this raises an interesting parallel seen amongst humans. Especially as the big drug companies have aggressively denied any such links and come down heavily on anybody highlighting the issue. The following piece was taken from a recent Daily Mail article highlighting the increase in autism amongst pets given vaccinations.

Daily Mail: 
Vaccines given to dogs are making them ill, a pet charity claimed yesterday. 

Profit-hungry drug companies and vets are 'frightening' dog owners into inoculating their pets more often than necessary, according to Canine Health Concern. 

Some puppies have developed conditions including autism and epilepsy after a raft of injections, it warns. 

Catherine O'Driscoll, from the charity, said: 'We are not anti-vaccination. What we are saying is that currently our pets are receiving far too many. 

'The latest scientific research shows that after the first course of injections as a puppy most dogs are immune against these diseases for at least seven years, if not for life. 

'Every year pet vaccination companies hold National Vaccination Month, a national campaign when pet owners whose boosters have lapsed by 18 months or more are terrified into having their pet jabbed. 

'While the vast majority of vets might simply not be aware of the latest scientific research, we are concerned that for a few undoubtedly doing multiple jabs is a way of making more money from worried pet owners.' 

Puppies are vaccinated against distemper, hepatitis, parvovirus, leptospirosis and parainfluenza up to three times by the age of four months. 

They may also be immunised against coronavirus, rabies, Lyme disease and bordetella or kennel cough. Booster shots are given every year or every three or four years. 

But some have suffered dramatic changes in behaviour or been diagnosed with cancer within months of the injections, Canine Health Concern says. 

In a letter backed by 17 vets and other pet experts, the charity has called on the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, which monitors animal vaccines, to issue new advice on their use. 

Mrs O'Driscoll, who believes cats and rabbits could also be at risk, added that a simple blood test would determine whether an animal needed a booster shot. 

Richard Allport, a Hertfordshire vet who has signed the letter to the VMD, said he was 'constantly' seeing animals that had developed 'worrying symptoms' after vaccination. 

But other animal charities said vaccination was vital. The Dogs Trust said all jabs were thoroughly tested for safety and warned that blood tests were not completely reliable. Its veterinary director, Chris Laurence, said a study looking for a connection between jabs and sudden ill-health failed to find a link. 

Professor Steve Dean, chief executive of the VMD, said: 'Many veterinary surgeons can remember the devastating effects these once common-diseases had on our pets, their owners and families, and the huge benefit vaccines have had on improving the health and welfare of the canine population should be recognised.' 

A spokesman added that the 80million-plus doses of vaccine since 1985 had generated fewer than 7,000 reports of side effects.

Cycles
We discussed the topic of Cycles of energy where the drama of life seems to have different themes. We also touched on the seven year cycle that humans have where big changes can take place within the person, especially around the middle years.

Healing
We discussed the different methods of healing and how energy is used by the sender and recipient to help promote healing in the body. Also how a tipping can be reached where no healing can take place as the body is too far compromised. 

The Cove - Slaughter of Dolphins in Japan to fed Children
In Japan, fishermen round up and slaughter hundreds and even thousands of dolphins and other small whales each year. 

In the small fishing village of Taiji, entire schools of dolphins are driven into a hidden cove after a prolonged chase. Once trapped inside the cove, the fishermen kill the dolphins, slashing their throats with knives or stabbing them with spears. The water turns red with their blood, and the air fills with their screams.

This brutal massacre - the largest scale dolphin kill in the world - goes on for six months of every year. Even more scandalous, members of the international dolphin display industry take advantage of the dolphin slaughter to obtain some few, show-quality dolphins for use in captive dolphin shows and dolphin swim programs. 

It is commonly assumed that Japanese fishermen hunt dolphins to supply a small minority of Japanese people with dolphin meat. But unlike the expensive whale meat, dolphin meat is not considered a delicacy in Japan, and the real reason the Japanese government issues permits to kill dolphins by the thousands every year has nothing to do with food culture. It has to do with pest control. As shocking as it sounds, some Japanese government officials view dolphins as pests to be eradicated in huge numbers. During a meeting at Taiji City Hall, the fishermen of Taiji admitted this to us. "We don't kill the dolphins primarily for their meat. We kill them as a form of pest control," they told us. In other words, killing the competition is their way of preserving the ocean's fish for themselves.

Most likely in order to push the food culture issue even further, the Japanese government recently introduced pilot whale meat to children's school lunch programs, despite the fact that the meat is tainted with mercury and not fit for human consumption. The Japanese government and the dolphin hunters do not warn the Japanese people of this danger, although the dolphin meat should be labelled as toxic. Much of the tainted dolphin meat ends up as counterfeit whale meat in Tokyo and other large cities. 

Science has established that dolphins are highly intelligent and complex marine mammals. How can "pest control" on dolphins continue with so little opposition from the Japanese people and the outside world? The answer is secrecy. Since we first travelled to Japan in 2003 to document the dolphin hunt and expose it to the world, the fishermen have become increasingly paranoid about being photographed and filmed. Today, they hide the dolphin slaughter behind barbed wire, ropes and tarpaulin. Killing the dolphins before daylight breaks, they station guards at the mouth of the killing cove to ensure that no one witnesses the blood bath. 

The fishermen say they kill the dolphins "quickly and humanely." That's an outright lie. The methods used to kill the dolphins are so savage, it's hard to believe it unless you witness it for yourself. And once you've seen it, the images and sounds of the screaming dolphins never go away. The fishermen know that the world will be outraged when the truth gets out. And so, guided by their government, they hide behind phrases such as "food culture" and "tradition." They even once told us they are proud of what they do. If they had told us they were having fun while killing dolphins, we would have believed them. We have heard them laugh out loud as they were throwing spears at the dolphins and hauling them ashore with ropes, or dragging still live dolphins by their tail flukes to be slaughtered. If they were really proud of this, then why do they go to such extreme measures hiding it? Why won't they even let their own people know about the hunt? We asked them this once, and the answer was: "It is none of their business." But it is their business. The Japanese people have every right to know about the dolphin slaughter. And they have a right to know about the mercury-poisoned dolphin meat that is being fed to their children.

Philadelphia Experiment
Gregory confirmed that the following experiment did actually take place.

We discussed the subject of the "Philadelphia Experiment" which was rumoured to have taken place in the year 1943 and later made into a Hollywood film depicting the dematerialisation of US Navy ship the USS Eldridge. The ship and its crew were suddenly thrown through time and space, with two crew members apparently popping out into 1983. Many of the crew members became tragically embedded in the ships exterior on its return. 

The Story:

The story begins in June of 1943, with the Destroyer Escort, U.S.S. Eldridge, DE-173, being fitted with tons of experimental electronic equipment. This included, according to one source, two massive generators of 75 KVA each, mounted where the forward gun turret would have been, distributing their power through four magnetic coils mounted on the deck. Three RF transmitters (2 megawatt CW each, mounted on the deck), three thousand "6L6" power amplifier tubes (used to drive the field coils of the two generators), special synchronizing and modulation circuits, and a host of other specialized hardware were employed to generate massive electromagnetic fields which, when properly configured, would be able to bend light and radio waves around the ship, thus making it invisible to enemy observers.

The "experiment," said to have taken place at the Philadelphia Navy Yard and also at sea, took place on at least one occasion while in full view of the Merchant Marine ship S.S. Andrew Furuseth, and other observation ships. The S.S. Andrew Furuseth becomes significant because one of its crewmen is the source of most of the original material making up the PX legend. Carlos Miguele Allende, also known as (A.K.A.) Carl Michael Allen, wrote a series of strange letters to one Dr. Morris K. Jessup in the 1950's in which he described what he claims to have witnessed: at least one of the several phases of the 
Philadelphia Experiment.

At 0900 hours, on July 22nd, 1943, the power to the generators was turned on, and the massive electromagnetic fields started to build up. A greenish fog was seen to slowly envelop the ship, concealing it from view. Then the fog itself is said to have disappeared, taking the U.S.S. Eldridge with it, leaving only undisturbed water where the ship had been anchored only moments before.

The elite officers of the U.S. Navy and scientists involved gazed in awe at their greatest achievement: the ship and crew were not only radar invisible but invisible to the eye as well! Everything worked as planned, and about fifteen minutes later they ordered the men to shut down the generators. The greenish fog slowly reappeared, and the U.S.S. Eldridge began to re-materialize as the fog subsided, but it was evident to all that something had gone wrong.

When boarded by personnel from shore, the crewmembers above decks were disoriented and nauseous. The U.S. Navy removed the crew from that original experiment, and shortly afterward, obtained another crew for a second experiment. In the end, the U.S. Navy decided that they only wanted to achieve radar invisibility, and the equipment was altered.

On the 28th of October in 1943, at 17:15, the final test on the U.S.S. Eldridge was performed. The electromagnetic field generators were turned on again, and the U.S.S. Eldridge became nearly invisible. Only a faint outline of the hull remained visible in the water. Everything was fine for the first few seconds, and then, in a blinding blue flash, the ship completely vanished. Within seconds it reappeared hundreds of miles away, in Norfolk, Virginia, and was seen for several minutes. The U.S.S. Eldridge then disappeared from Norfolk as mysteriously as it had arrived, and reappeared back in Philadelphia Naval Yard. This time most of the sailors were violently sick. Some of the crew were simply "missing" never to return. Some of the crew went crazy. The strangest result of all of this experiment was that five men were found fused to the metal within the ship's structure.

The men that survived were never the same again. Those that lived were discharged as "mentally unfit" for duty, regardless of their true condition.

So, what had begun as an experiment in electronic camouflage, ended up as an accidental teleportation of an entire ship and crew, to a distant location and back again, all in a matter of minutes!

Although the above may seem fantastic, one must remember, that in the 1940's the atomic bomb was also being invented.

The Meaning of Life
Gregory gave a very simple answer to this question which was "Experience" but then followed with a very comprehensive answer relative to the whole universe rather than just answering from a human perspective. 

The Self, Personality and Nature vs. Nature / Multiple Personalities
We then touched on the topic of Self, and how personalities are defined, is it Nature vs. Nature? and also how we are also made up of our Spirit/Soul self.

<description><![CDATA[The Universe and Big Bang
The mainstream media of late (The BBC) has been increasingly reporting on ground breaking science ideas that are confirming more and more esoterical and spiritual theories of the universe. The BBC's Horizon programme has even gone as far to suggest that there are infinite universes. It's certainly looking like Science and Metaphysics could be on the cusp to actually agreeing with each over. 

In this show we discussed some of these concepts with Gregory.

Big Bang Theory
Gregory confirmed that our universe has gone through thousands of big bang scenarios, which are part of a cycle. The universe continues to expand, one day it will simply stop. The universe is currently expanding out in all directions at different rates. Universes with a similar vibration index can collide and cause new formations of energy to take places. Our universe is part of another universe which is far larger, a multiverse of many universes. 

Star Trek
This got us onto the subject of Star Trek where many people have suggested that the space series really depicts what our universe could be like with all the different life forms out there. Even beings the size of galaxies. Gregory confirmed that the series very accurately depicts how the universe is and the different types of beings that inhabit it.

Portals
We discussed the topic of Portals or worm holes which allow beings or humans with heart felt good intent to pass from one reality to another without being destroyed. We discussed the true life story of a modern day Indiana Jones type person who took a party of people to a secret portal in the mountains of Peru, a place only known by the local indigenous people, who trusted their spiritual friend with the location. 

On arriving there his friends watched from afar as he placed his face into a small indentation in the rock face. As he stepped up and placed his face on the rock, he started to chant a series of tones. After a few seconds he set his intention and suddenly without warning simply faded out. His friends from behind him witnessed his physical body actually fade out. 

The gentleman actually experienced travelling to another reality where he spent a good couple of hours. Once he had finished, he then travelled back to the Earthly portal. His friends saw him fade back in, only disappearing in Earth time for a few minutes.

Quite an amazing story. 

Gregory confirmed that this actually happened. There are currently 16 natural portals located on the Earth. The good thing is, they can only be used by those with heart felt good intentions.

Conspiracy Theories
This was actually a very interesting topic of discussion. There is a lot of fear based theories on the net with a high number of theories on Planet X, Pole Shifts, World War Three, Geophysical events. The idea of the question was to ascertain the best way to approach this material without being caught up in the fear of it all and find a balance. As spiritual people waking up it's important to research and find out what's really going on. Gregory was very humble and caring in his approach to answering this question and confirmed that there is a grain of truth in most theories so we shouldn't discount then, there are many dark minds doing things in our name that we can't even comprehend. So it seems that we should research and stay alert, but try not to let it take over your life and do what you can to make a difference.

Meeting Your Gude
This is one of the most commonly asked questions on our site and forum so we asked Gregory to answer it. Enjoy the show!!

The universe is currently expanding out in all directions at different rates. Universes with a similar vibration index can collide and cause new formations of energy to take places. Our universe is part of another universe which is far larger, a multiverse of many universes. 

Star Trek
This got us onto the subject of Star Trek where many people have suggested that the space series really depicts what our universe could be like with all the different life forms out there. Even beings the size of galaxies. Gregory confirmed that the series very accurately depicts how the universe is and the different types of beings that inhabit it.

Portals
We discussed the topic of Portals or worm holes which allow beings or humans with heart felt good intent to pass from one reality to another without being destroyed. We discussed the true life story of a modern day Indiana Jones type person who took a party of people to a secret portal in the mountains of Peru, a place only known by the local indigenous people, who trusted their spiritual friend with the location. 

On arriving there his friends watched from afar as he placed his face into a small indentation in the rock face. As he stepped up and placed his face on the rock, he started to chant a series of tones. After a few seconds he set his intention and suddenly without warning simply faded out. His friends from behind him witnessed his physical body actually fade out. 

The gentleman actually experienced travelling to another reality where he spent a good couple of hours. Once he had finished, he then travelled back to the Earthly portal. His friends saw him fade back in, only disappearing in Earth time for a few minutes.

Quite an amazing story. 

Gregory confirmed that this actually happened. There are currently 16 natural portals located on the Earth. The good thing is, they can only be used by those with heart felt good intentions.

Conspiracy Theories
This was actually a very interesting topic of discussion. There is a lot of fear based theories on the net with a high number of theories on Planet X, Pole Shifts, World War Three, Geophysical events. The idea of the question was to ascertain the best way to approach this material without being caught up in the fear of it all and find a balance. As spiritual people waking up it's important to research and find out what's really going on. Gregory was very humble and caring in his approach to answering this question and confirmed that there is a grain of truth in most theories so we shouldn't discount then, there are many dark minds doing things in our name that we can't even comprehend. So it seems that we should research and stay alert, but try not to let it take over your life and do what you can to make a difference.

Meeting Your Gude
This is one of the most commonly asked questions on our site and forum so we asked Gregory to answer it. Enjoy the show!!


And much more...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 19-Do Plants Feel Pain? - Animal-Spirits, Solar Flares, More Quakes</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[The First half is all about Plants and Animals, do plants feel pain? is it wrong to cut flowers, is one animal or insect more sacred than another, how do animal soul groups work? Scroll down to Part II for a list of very good questions sent in by one of our listeners.

In the second half of the show we covered the following hot topics currently happening on planet Earth right now:

Second Half Topics
Increase in Solar Flares, 
Earth Quakes
Rouge 50 Mile Icebergs
Killer Whales

First Half
We based the first part of the show around these questions which provided some great answers from Gregory and the White Cloud Group:

Questions:

"Firstly, I am a vegan because I believe that in our (UK) society in the 21st century we do not need to use animals for food or any other purpose and any use of animals will cause them suffering. I live my life trying to avoid causing suffering to any living being as much as I possibly can. I wonder if Gregory can explain the difference between using plants and using animals. To us the difference seems obvious (in that it does not appear that plants suffer on the surface) however I understand every living being has consciousness and I wonder how much suffering we inflict on the plants that we eat or use for clothing etc and also I no longer buy cut flowers for my home because I wonder if this is actually an act of violence from the plant's perspective."

"I wonder if we should use animals at all, such as for guide dogs or for horse riding or if, even by a loving human, this is exploitation because the animal is conditioned to do our will."

"Is there a difference between the sacredness of say a slug and an elephant? Should we discriminate and make choices as to the difference in the meaning of their lives and if so on what should we base this discrimination?"

"I would love to hear the spiritual perspective on how I can enjoy my life without feeling guilty about those in desperately poor countries who can barely survive. I do n

ot have much compared to many, yet I feel abundant because I have enough money to keep a roof over my head, to buy food and clothing, and I have access to health care etc. I sometimes feel guilty that I have so much when others have nothing. I am hugely grateful for my lifestyle and I want to enjoy it but I do struggle with this from time to time."

Second Half
From Feb 2010 the Sun suddenly burst back into life shooting of solar flares, and a great magnetic filament rising high above the Sun. We also had sun spots regularly featured on the surface everyday. Could Earth be under threat from a solar storm and are they connected to the other events happening on the planet right now such as the noticeable increase in quakes?. Also this week a large 50 mile Iceberg was broken off after a collision with another Iceberg, scientists are worried that it could affect weather patterns for years to come.

And much more...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 18 - Time Travel, Crop Circles, De Ja Vu, Aura, Spirit Privacy</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[We based today's show around the following questions taken from our Facebook community and comments posted by people visiting the site.

Thank you to those who took the time to send in questions as they formed the basis of a very interesting show.

Time Travel
We also discussed paradoxes, the complexities of Time Travel and multiple time lines.

Crop Circles
We discussed a recent documentary called "I Believe in UFO's" with Danny Dyer who visited Wiltshire to meet believers investigating the crop circles and skeptics who claimed to make them. Gregory agreed that there are three groups making them, humans, Spirit (Orbs) and E.T.

Topics discussed: The Aura and Colours, Cell Memory, Akashic Memory, Mischievous Spirits, De Ja Vu, Time Travel, Privacy from Spirit, Crop Circles, Positive and Negative spirits.

Questions below:
Q1.
"The healing group with which I work has tended to think that it is not right for us to venture into finding out now what is contained within our Akashic records - i.e. that we should do our best to learn, love and advance ourselves on the earth plane in ignorance of the contents of those records. Would Gregory kindly comment on whether he feels that is our business to know the contents while we are on earth, whether it is right or indeed advisable for us to know and act upon the records' contents. Thank you."

Q2.
"What does it mean when a person sees certain colours and the person becomes one with the colors in a trance like state?"

Q3.
"I'd like to ask about de ja vu ..please? "

Q4.1
"Can any one help? i often get cold parts around my body..ie top of arm/s back of legs..back/neck..how do you differentiate between good spirit too and not so good spirit..i have some not so nice experiences and whilst mopping the floor last night i had some one/thing try tugging my jumper, many a time when sleeping or should i say just going to sleep when i get the feeling that i am being shoved or shaken..as if they don't want you to sleep...i protect my self with the gold ray of Christ and invoke Archangel Michael as well as asking my gaurdian angel for protection..some night i am woken so frequently i feel incredibly tired..where am i going wrong?
thanks heather xx"

Q4.2
"On several occasions I have had who I think is my husbands grandfather prod me in the back when I have overstepped the mark with my comments in an argument with my husband. I know I have 5 spirits living with me but feel they are trying to stop us moving now, I want to know how to reassure them that they are welcome to come with us where ever we go, but they seem to be blocking the viewings. and playing around with the phone line. both land line and mobiles in the house. I have a problem with my phone mobile that is in the centre line of my house it cuts out can anyone explain if this is a vortex."

Q5
"I'm sorry if my naivety offends anyway, but i would like to ask if our spirit guides are with us at all times,what about our privacy..ie showering and bathing,its a question my children ask all the time,as they are aware our passed over family are with us but,know bath times are private things.?...."

And much more..

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 17 - Chakras, Orbs, NDEs, Enlightenment, Strange Lights</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Strange Lights in the Sky
At the start of the show Ian briefly shared with Gregory an experience he had straight after recording the last show, where he witnessed very strange lights in the sky. The lights seemed to coincide with a solar flare that was due to hit the atmosphere on the 19th of January, the night of the show. Gregory shared his thoughts on this event with the listeners. It seems the event was a combination of a new strange weather anomaly, mentioned by Gregory in a previous show where we will start to see a new type of silent lighting. Plus the added affects of particles hitting the atmosphere from the solar event.

Aura and Chakra System
Gregory gave his views on the Chakra system and how every living thing has the same system in place, providing us with many dimensional viewpoints/expressions to work with. Some very interesting areas covered in discussing this topic.

Orbs
Orbs seem to be a relatively new phenomenon with the advent of digital technology. Ian asked if it was the new camera's producing the Orbs or if Orbs really do now exist. Gregory thankfully confirmed that the majority of Orbs captured are Spirit. Apparently it's not the new digital camera's allowing them to be picked up, it's just a new way for to make themselves known to us, as our interest in sprit grows. A century ago it was much easier for spirit to fully manifest, such as the case of Physical Medium Helen Duncan, providing ectoplasm to allow spirit to form. However due to high electromagnetic pollution brought about by our technological savvy world, it's much harder for full manifesting to take place, as it takes a lot more energy. It's much easier for spirit to generate energy in plasma disks. Sometimes, even manifesting their faces in to the plasma disk.

Near Death Experience / Life Review / OBEs
We then moved onto the topic of Near-Death-Experience where many people temporally pass in to spirit and meet loved ones or spiritual figures. The person is then subsequently taken through a life review process via their Akashic book, experiencing in some cases every action, thought and consequence of their actions on others. 

Enlightenment
Gregory and the group gave us a wonderful insight into what it is to be enlightened or to become enlightened. Many people are attempting to go through this process, part of the spiritual awakening/revolution we are going through. In a sense just being in that state of bliss is a form of enlightenment whether you're a yogi in deep meditation or somebody in the later years of your life just being in peaceful and blissful state, happy and balanced in who they are and in what they have done. We discussed how this can also be achieved even living spiritually active lives, we don't have to be monks in a monastery to achieve this. Another topic was Bi-location which some spiritual masters seem to be able to do.

Being Human
At the end of the show we touched on other who don't have the same negative and positive experience of consciousness that we have to go through. Their state of being and intelligence is a marvel to watch. Apparently even a being the size of a dot had the most amazing Akashic book to read from the halls of learning, showing a completely different way of being.

Many people are attempting to go through this process, part of the spiritual awakening/revolution we are going through. In a sense just being in that state of bliss is a form of enlightenment whether you're a yogi in deep meditation or somebody in the later years of your life just being in peaceful and blissful state, happy and balanced in who they are and in what they have done. We discussed how this can also be achieved even living spiritually active lives, we don't have to be monks in a monastery to achieve this. Another topic was Bi-location which some spiritual masters seem to be able to do.

Being Human
At the end of the show we touched on other who don't have the same negative and positive experience of consciousness that we have to go through. Their state of being and intelligence is a marvel to watch. Apparently even a being the size of a dot had the most amazing Akashic book to read from the halls of learning, showing a completely different way of being.

<title>Discernment and the Battle for Light over Dark with Kerin Webb</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Kerin Webb</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Today's show was a real freestyler of a chat. Kerin has been producing many videos over the last year, getting the message across through his psychic prophecy channelling videos that humanity is standing on the edge of a very large shock. However, when it happens it will allow humanity to unite together and build a better world. Kerin and Ian discussed the many pitfalls of spirituality and religion where believing in something too much can actually be detrimental, and in fact paralyse or stop us from actually living or progressing. It's a real challenge; we walk a real fine line to keep ourselves in balance and not swaying too much in either direction. 

The discussion moved onto other subjects around Haiti and how different people justify the tragic events to either a punishing God because the people were bad or the other end of the spectrum that the people sacrificed themselves for us, so it gives us an opportunity to express our compassionate side. Both are similar believes at different ends of the spectrum, but both can be equally dangerous view points as it becomes easy for people to turn a blind eye when they can easily justify in their mind why events are taking place. 

And much more...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 16- Avatar The Real Story II, Haiti, Earth Quakes, Ley Lines, Vortexes</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Avatar The Real (Earth) Story Part II
With Gregory Haye from The White Cloud Group

In today's show we expanded on the message that was used in the recent YouTube video we produced called "Avatar The Real Story". The message within the video was taken from an archived show from early last year (2009). We created the video after the watching the film Avatar as we wanted to wake people up to the sad fact that this story is actually playing out here on planet Earth.

Quote: "The indigenous cultures are now banding together to help usher in a world of peace. However, these peaceful peoples have been fighting a secret war with corporate groups and government's hell bent on destroying their land for oil and other minerals. Many people have been killed on both sides of this secret war. However nothing is being reported in the controlled main stream media. It's important that we all get the word out. We can't afford more areas of our rain forests to be destroyed by these people as it will tip the balance even quicker."

Haiti, Earthquakes and increasing risk in other places
We discussed the tragic events that took place in Haiti this week where the region was struck by a massive 7.00 magnitude Earthquake sadly taking the lives of a great number of people. Gregory talked about further issues with huge Earthquakes being on the rise due to cyclic reasons within the Earth. Great stresses are still building up in other areas so we have to be vigilant and learn the lessons in helping and rescuing people from the Haiti quake. 
Risk to other areas include Alberta, California and Alaska and other southern areas of the Pacific rim.

Ley Lines, Vortexes, OBE's and NDE's
Gregory talked about the grid network of Ley Lines that cover the planet. Many religious buildings sit on the convergence points. The energies are used by many animals; humans can tap in the energies for higher states of consciousness and creativity. Conversely there are negative Lines via running streams that if running under a house or building can cause adverse affects for those inside. 

We also talked about Vortexes and how they are used by dimensional energies or spirit communication. Also how these vortexes are also used for the consciousness of a person to move their focus/mind back to the higher planes of consciousness/reality.

<title>Believe with Philip Kinsella - A ground breaking theory that bridges the Psychic and UFO phenomena</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Philip Kinsella</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[This week's guest is Philip Kinsella, a well known medium who has appeared on television and radio. He has written numerous articles and books on Paranormal and UFO phenomena. In tonights show we will touching on his new book Believe and how his ongoing work as a medium has helped bridge the gap between the UFO and Paranormal fields of research. 

About Believe
A ground breaking theory that bridges the gap between the Psychic and UFO phenomena.

UFOs have been ridiculed for decades, even when we are presented with the facts through hundreds and thousands of eye-witness accounts across the world. The same can be said for clairvoyants and their ability to commune with seemingly dead people. 

They have suffered under the hammer of rational thought. There can be no such things as UFOs or contact with our loved ones from the Other Side. Why are many so against these thoughts? What do we fear in allowing ourselves to open our minds to other dimensions? Philip Kinsella is a widely acclaimed clairvoyant, he has also had personal UFO experiences. 

Within this book Philip takes us on a journey to show us that something incredibly strange is happening to people, and so-called experts merely push such stories and experiences aside as pure fantasy. He says he would agree with them, if he had not had proof himself and gone through a similar experience as so many others have done with regards to UFO contact. 

The real reason we are not told about the validity of UFO contact is that we are dealing with more than just your average nuts-and-bolts crafts, and that a soul issue is also raised with regards to what these Greys are and where they really come from. Philip has researche

d UFOs for more than twenty years, and over that time an incredible realisation has occurred to him - we are 'definitely' not alone.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 15 - Fairies, Being in the Heart, Concensus reality, Jesus, Being Gay</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye, The White Cloud Group</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Fairies, Being in the Heart, Concensus reality, Jesus, Gay and Bisexuals

The first eight minutes of the show Gregory gave us a very interesting insight into the workings of the white cloud group, the group he is a spoke person for and who as a collective are responsible for the information brought through in the shows. We have also included info about the group at the bottom of this synopsis. 

Being in the Heart
Gregory discussed the topic of Love and Being in the Heart and a further discussion around Greg Braden's work linking Heart based emotions to affects on the Magnetic fields of the planet.

Excerpted from Greg Bradens' Fractal Time.

"Following the dicovery that the satellites had recorded spikes during events of global focus in the past, such as the death of Princess Diana and 911, the factor that seemed to connect the readings was clear: the indications pointed to the human heart. Specifically, it's the heart-based emotions of the world's population that results from such events that seems to be influencing the magnetic fields of the earth. What makes this discovery so significant is that those fields are now linked to everything from the stability of the climate to peace between nations....Among the new findings are two discoveries that give new meaning to what the satellites showed us on September 11, 2001: Discovery 1: It is well documented that the human heart generates the strongest magnetic field in the body, nearly 5,000 times stronger than that of the brain. This field creates a doughnut-shaped pattern that extends well beyond the physical body and heart. Data suggests that this field may be so large that we end up measuring it in miles; however, it's beyond the scope of the equipment used to detect such fields. Implication: The heart's magnetic field responds to the quality of emotion that we create in our lives. Just as the intuitive link between feelings and the body seems to suggest, positive emotions increase the physical balance of hormones and heart rhythms, as well as mental clarity and productivity. Just as inuitively, studies show that negative emotions can influence as many as 1,400 biochemical changes in the body that include hormonal imbalance, heart-rhythm chaos, mental "fogginess", and poor performance"

Breaking down concensus reality
We discussed the topic of concensus reality which is very much shaped by the mainstream papers, magazines and news which is affecting how people treat each other. I asked selfishly if financial collapse would give us a chance to reboot the system? 

Life of Jesus
We discussed the events the actually took place in Jesus's life confirming the core story to be true, however most of the positive teachings were removed from the bible around 500AD as a form of control.

Fairies
We had a wonderful discussion on Fairies thanks to a listener's question below:

"Gregory has previously mentioned that he marvels at the beauty of flowers in the spirit world and often talks to them. My question, 'is it wrong to buy cut flowers from the shops as they have been cut from growth. - also do the fairies stay with the flowers once they have been cut."

Is being Gay or Bisexual wrong in the eyes of God?

Another great question answered by Gregory via this question:

"My question is that in the light of the recent death of Steven Gately, I was wondering why some people come to earth either being gay or bisexual, could it be because they come from a soul group that are neither man or woman, and as it says in the bible that its wrong to be that way, how do spirit people really feel about it over there, and is it still thought of as being wrong? I cant understand why god would send people to this earth plane with feelings of that nature if he thought it was wrong to be that" way.

About Gregory and The White Cloud Group

The White Cloud group use a spirit being called Gregory to channel the groups messages via medium Mick Avery.

He is the spokesperson for a collection of highly evolved minds who are under the guidance of 'White Cloud' who is a Shining One. White Cloud was a notorious Cheyenne who lived on earth many hundreds of years ago, and he was a Shining One even then. It was through Gregory's endearing personality and wonderful communication skills that he was selected and asked to be the representative for the educational White Cloud Group.

Mick Avery has been channelling them for a decade now through their international work on SpiritWorksRadio. As an interviewer and spiritual researcher, Ian Jones came across their work in early 2009 via his own tierless work at TheSpiritGuides.co.uk website to help bring knowledge and spiritual wisdom interviewing various guests on the TheSpiritGuides.co.uk Podcast show. Listening to one of the shows it appears Ian was also chosen to do this work.

The White Cloud Group are an educational group who offer us answers to the worlds problems. They bring their observations and converse in a down-to-earth way that anyone can understand and are completely open to debate and questioning. In fact, they welcome such interaction; feeling that it is only through dissemination of information that mankind can make necessary adjustments to their ways of thinking.

Because of the massive scientific background and eminent minds of the White Cloud Group, they are able to go way beyond the constraints and limitations of our human minds. They have answers to our quantum theory puzzles and the mysteries of our world, which have been so far unexplainable. They consist of scientists, physicists, alchemists, geophysicists, medics, scholars of all description, plus ordinary people who are trying to be of assistance by showing us how we can become in harmony with each other and all things and, consequently, save the planet.

The topics of discussion are limitless. They speak about life after death and, of course, the details relating to the mechanisms behind paranormal events and etheric world communications. It is not set in monosyllables from beings telling us to mindlessly follow what they say or what anyone else is saying. They discuss and explain their concepts, views and visions, not from a religious viewpoint or tradition, yet are undeniably elevated, but without ego.

It is freethinking and empowering interactive conversation from those who are watching over us, who care about us and our planet and understand what we are going through. Who understand the need to create a peaceful and stable world.
Knowledge exists to share so all may benefit.

The first eight minutes of the show Gregory gave us a very interesting insight into the workings of the white cloud group, the group he is a spoke person for and who as a collective are responsible for the information brought through in the shows. We have also included info about the group at the bottom of this synopsis. 

Being in the Heart
Gregory discussed the topic of Love and Being in the Heart and a further discussion around Greg Braden's work linking Heart based emotions to affects on the Magnetic fields of the planet.

Excerpted from Greg Bradens' Fractal Time.

"Following the dicovery that the satellites had recorded spikes during events of global focus in the past, such as the death of Princess Diana and 911, the factor that seemed to connect the readings was clear: the indications pointed to the human heart. Specifically, it's the heart-based emotions of the world's population that results from such events that seems to be influencing the magnetic fields of the earth. What makes this discovery so significant is that those fields are now linked to everything from the stability of the climate to peace between nations....Among the new findings are two discoveries that give new meaning to what the satellites showed us on September 11, 2001: Discovery 1: It is well documented that the human heart generates the strongest magnetic field in the body, nearly 5,000 times stronger than that of the brain. This field creates a doughnut-shaped pattern that extends well beyond the physical body and heart. Data suggests that this field may be so large that we end up measuring it in miles; however, it's beyond the scope of the equipment used to detect such fields. Implication: The heart's magnetic field responds to the quality of emotion that we create in our lives. Just as the intuitive link between feelings and the body seems to suggest, positive emotions increase the physical balance of hormones and heart rhythms, as well as mental clarity and productivity. Just as inuitively, studies show that negative emotions can influence as many as 1,400 biochemical changes in the body that include hormonal imbalance, heart-rhythm chaos, mental "fogginess", and poor performance"

Breaking down concensus reality
We discussed the topic of concensus reality which is very much shaped by the mainstream papers, magazines and news which is affecting how people treat each other. I asked selfishly if financial collapse would give us a chance to reboot the system? 

Life of Jesus
We discussed the events the actually took place in Jesus's life confirming the core story to be true, however most of the positive teachings were removed from the bible around 500AD as a form of control.

Fairies
We had a wonderful discussion on Fairies thanks to a listener's question below:

"Gregory has previously mentioned that he marvels at the beauty of flowers in the spirit world and often talks to them. My question, 'is it wrong to buy cut flowers from the shops as they have been cut from growth. - also do the fairies stay with the flowers once they have been cut."

Is being Gay or Bisexual wrong in the eyes of God?

Another great question answered by Gregory via this question:

"My question is that in the light of the recent death of Steven Gately, I was wondering why some people come to earth either being gay or bisexual, could it be because they come from a soul group that are neither man or woman, and as it says in the bible that its wrong to be that way, how do spirit people really feel about it over there, and is it still thought of as being wrong? I cant understand why god would send people to this earth plane with feelings of that nature if he thought it was wrong to be that" way.

About Gregory and The White Cloud Group

The White Cloud group use a spirit being called Gregory to channel the groups messages via medium Mick Avery.

He is the spokesperson for a collection of highly evolved minds who are under the guidance of 'White Cloud' who is a Shining One. White Cloud was a notorious Cheyenne who lived on earth many hundreds of years ago, and he was a Shining One even then. It was through Gregory's endearing personality and wonderful communication skills that he was selected and asked to be the representative for the educational White Cloud Group.

Mick Avery has been channelling them for a decade now through their international work on SpiritWorksRadio. As an interviewer and spiritual researcher, Ian Jones came across their work in early 2009 via his own tierless work at TheSpiritGuides.co.uk website to help bring knowledge and spiritual wisdom interviewing various guests on the TheSpiritGuides.co.uk Podcast show. Listening to one of the shows it appears Ian was also chosen to do this work.

The White Cloud Group are an educational group who offer us answers to the worlds problems. They bring their observations and converse in a down-to-earth way that anyone can understand and are completely open to debate and questioning. In fact, they welcome such interaction; feeling that it is only through dissemination of information that mankind can make necessary adjustments to their ways of thinking.

Because of the massive scientific background and eminent minds of the White Cloud Group, they are able to go way beyond the constraints and limitations of our human minds. They have answers to our quantum theory puzzles and the mysteries of our world, which have been so far unexplainable. They consist of scientists, physicists, alchemists, geophysicists, medics, scholars of all description, plus ordinary people who are trying to be of assistance by showing us how we can become in harmony with each other and all things and, consequently, save the planet.

The topics of discussion are limitless. They speak about life after death and, of course, the details relating to the mechanisms behind paranormal events and etheric world communications. It is not set in monosyllables from beings telling us to mindlessly follow what they say or what anyone else is saying. They discuss and explain their concepts, views and visions, not from a religious viewpoint or tradition, yet are undeniably elevated, but without ego.

It is freethinking and empowering interactive conversation from those who are watching over us, who care about us and our planet and understand what we are going through. Who understand the need to create a peaceful and stable world.
Knowledge exists to share so all may benefit.

<title>UFOs are Here to Stay, Extraterrestrial beings and The Aetherius Society with Mark Bennett</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Mark Bennett</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[This week's guest is Spiritual Writer and Lecturer Mark Bennett. 
Mark is the co-author of two books, Prayer Energy and Gods, Guides and Guarding Angels, which he wrote alongside international bestselling, author Richard Lawrence.

He works full-time for The Aetherius Society, an international spiritual organisation founded by E.T contactee, Dr Greorge King. Mark is helping spread the society's spiritual teachings channelled through Dr King from positive and advanced extraterrestrial beings.

In today's show Mark discusses some of the core spiritual teachings adopted by the Aetherius Society through the work of Dr George King, who was contacted by advanced extraterrestrial beings back in 1954 who to help spread their spiritual wisdom. Over the next two decades he continued to act as Primary Terrestrial Mental Channel, recording over 600 Cosmic Transmissions from the Space Masters.

Determined to help humanity raise itself from universal suffering and ignorance, his life's mission became apparent on May 8, 1954. Alone in his London apartment, a loud physical voice delivered the following Command:
 
"Prepare yourself! You are to become the voice of Interplanetary Parliament."
 
He was initially shocked by the implications of this statement. It came out of the blue without warning or explanation. All he knew with his mastery over terrestrial phenomena was that what he had heard, he had heard.
 
A few days later he was visited by a world-renowned Yoga Master whom he knew to be alive and active in India at that time. This Master, in every way physical, entered and left through a locked door that he did not open.
 
During the meeting, Dr. King was given a series of highly specialized exercises enabling him to bring about a state of consciousness necessary for the establishment of mental rapport with the Cosmic Masters who inhabit the higher planes of other planets.

Quote from Mark's website:
"Humanity is slowly waking up to the fact that we are not alone in the universe. As UFO sightings appear to be on the rise, some obvious questions remain unanswered by governments, scientists and world religions. Even if only a tiny percentage of all UFOs are indeed extraterrestrial spacecraft - surely this has staggering implications for all humanity. "

<title>Journeys Into Consciousness 14 - Pearl Harbour, Angels in Space, Iran, The Day E.T. Boarded the Space Shuttle</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today&#039;s show we discussed the following:

Pearl Harbour
It was the anniversary of Pearl Harbour this week, the 7th of December. We honored those who lost their lives and loved one&#039;s on this tragic day. We discussed the parallels with 9/11. Did those in the higher echelons of power know the attacks were going to happen and use it for their own agenda to bring America in to the war? Gregory agreed.

Angels in Space
We discussed the main stream media news report that Soviet Cosmonauts witnessed 7 giant figures with wings and mist like halos on board their orbiting space craft. Report taken verbatim below:

&quot;Something occurred with the Soviet Cosmonauts in the Salyut 7 that orbited the earth in 1985. This is a rather hushed secret that has been leaked to the west . . .
The six Soviet Cosmonauts in 1985 saw &quot;celestial beings&quot; on the 155th day aboard their orbiting space station. This was first reported by Cosmonaut Vladimir Solevev and Oleg Atkov as well as Leonid Kizim. This is what they said, &quot;What we saw were seven giant figures in the form of humans, but with wings and mist-like halos as in the classic depiction of angels.&quot; 
 
As the Cosmonauts were performing medical experiments in Salyut 7 high above the earth, a brilliant orange cloud enveloped them, blinding them temporarily, and when their eyes cleared, they saw the angels. 
 
The heavenly visitors, they said, followed them for about 10 minutes and vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. However, 12 days later, Cosmonauts Svetlana Savitskaya, Igor Volk, and Vladimir Dzhanibevok, who had just joined the others on the space station, also saw the beings. &quot;They were glowing,&quot; they reported. &quot;We were truly overwhelmed. There was a great orange light, and through it, we could see the figures of seven angels. They were smiling as though they shared a glorious secret, but within a few minutes, they were gone, and we never saw them again.&quot; 

Iran / North Korea
Many space nations seem to have common symbols that appear on their space suits, flags, crests or coat of arms. A recent &quot;Moon Rising&quot; documentary uploaded on to YouTube highlighted the many parallels. With this in mind it seemed obvious to me that what we perceive as enemies down at the sheeple or hurd level, the elite at the top of the social/political structure seem to have some kind of unified allegiance with each over or other outwardly beings. Gregory confirmed that this is in fact the case. The drama is created by those behind the scenes to keep us all busy fearing and hating each over, which in turn keeps us all separate, distracted and ignorant of the greater reality and those trying to control us.

The Day E.T. Boarded the Space Shuttle
We discussed the following main stream media news item confiming that NASA astronauts had witnessed 9 feet tall humanoid alians on board the space shuttle. Gregory confirmed the story, even naming the race of beings involved.

&quot;A FORMER NASA employee has just revealed that he witnessed two American astronauts meeting an extraterrestrial during a Space Shuttle mission. Space Craft Operator Clark McClelland worked for the space agency from 1958 to 1992, assisting with the Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Apollo-Soyuz, Skylab and Deep Space Missions, as well as overseeing launches of the space shuttle and the International Space Station programs.

McClelland recently revealed an encounter he witnessed on 27-inch video monitors while manning the Kennedy Space Center Launch Control Center (LCC). A strange, triangular craft surrounded by a hazy field hovered behind the open bay doors of the space shuttle while an alien being interacted with two NASA astronauts. "It was a tall creature, about 8 to 9 feet tall," reveals McClelland, who unveiled an artist's conception of the meeting on his Web site, http://www.stargate-chronicles.com.

"It had a humanoid body shape with two arms, two hands, two legs, two feet, a slim torso and a normal size head for its size. "The helmet was not as large as our two NASA Astronauts, and had a viewport to look forward." McClellan couldn't hear any communication between the astronauts and the humanoid. He says the creature had a small device that could have been a kind of communicator attached to the side of its helmet, but also waved its arms around as if giving instructions. Although our astronauts were tethered to their shuttle, the alien appeared to be moving freely and had no oxygen tanks. "The color of its skin I could not determine," Mc- Clellan recalls. "It appeared to have two what appeared to be eyes, but it was not detailed enough for any other comments."

The NASA veteran later heard from a friend who, during a different mission, observed an 8- to 9-foot-tall extraterrestrial inside the space shuttle crew compartment. Both missions were sponsored by the Department of Defense and given top secret classification. UFO researchers say McClellan's story fits in with other information the government tried to keep secret. British hacker Gary McKinnon broke into government computers and found Pentagon and NASA files that listed "non-terrestrial officers" involved in "fleet-to-fleet transfers." Ufologists point out that McClellan comes from an unimpeachable background as a space scientist, and his account is consistent with what we already know about secret government projects involving UFOs.&quot;

Gary Mckinnon
We discussed the case of UFO Hacker Gary McKinnon.

Climate Change
Gregory discussed the new weather cycle which we entered last year. We are apparently at the lull end of the cycle before the storm. He confirmed that we will start to see new cloud formations not seen before on Earth and even silent lighting storms with no thunder. 

Listen Questions:
We discussed the following questions from our listeners:

Why are the Jews the chosen race on Earth?

Would Gregory kindly explain what is meant by the earth being a living thing. I understand that all matter is in a way living, with its own vibration, but does the earth have any ability as an entity to influence events, to create situations, itself? Or do conditions simply react to energies created by the earth&#039;s inhabitants&#039; energies? Many thanks and thanks, too, for Gregory&#039;s always enlightening and wise words. What a wide sphere of knowledge he possesses.

And much more...

Ufologists point out that McClellan comes from an unimpeachable background as a space scientist, and his account is consistent with what we already know about secret government projects involving UFOs.&quot;

Gary Mckinnon
We discussed the case of UFO Hacker Gary McKinnon.

Climate Change
Gregory discussed the new weather cycle which we entered last year. We are apparently at the lull end of the cycle before the storm. He confirmed that we will start to see new cloud formations not seen before on Earth and even silent lighting storms with no thunder. 

Listen Questions:
We discussed the following questions from our listeners:

Why are the Jews the chosen race on Earth?

Would Gregory kindly explain what is meant by the earth being a living thing. I understand that all matter is in a way living, with its own vibration, but does the earth have any ability as an entity to influence events, to create situations, itself? Or do conditions simply react to energies created by the earth&#039;s inhabitants&#039; energies? Many thanks and thanks, too, for Gregory&#039;s always enlightening and wise words. What a wide sphere of knowledge he possesses.

And much more...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 13 - Climate Change Hoax? - Hadron Collider - Listeners Questions</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show we discussed the following:

Climate Change - Real or a Hoax?
Gregory discussed his views on the recent release of hacked climate change data which is alleged to show scientists cooking the books for their own agendas. We also discussed what's really happening to the climate, especially in light of the recent biblical floods across Cumbria in the UK and the devastating droughts affecting most of the worlds food output.

CERN - The Large Hadron Collider
Gregory discussed his thoughts on the Large Hadron Collider that was switched on last week.

The Higgs boson, also known as the God Particle is the only Standard Model particle that has not been observed. Experimental detection of the Higgs boson would help explain the origin of mass in the universe. 

Pivotal Time in History
We also discussed that we're now in a Pivotal time in history where we have the best opportunity to make positive strides as a race. There are beings here to assist us make this leap, however we have to be discerning as the opposite is also true.

Listener Questions
For the remainder of the show, we touched on some questions from our listeners.

Question:

"If you or I wanted to located someone on earth, say an old friend, we would locate them by a house number, street name, town, country, etc and in a conversation we would say that we have found our friend, 

And he is at 92 west street, Dartford, Kent, England for instance.

Now... If Gregory wanted to find an old friend, he would just think of them, and hey presto he would be there, but if he was talking to another friend abut finding his old friend, what would the conversation be like? Would he say I have found Fred, and he is living on the 7th dimension, in the summerlands, in an town called utopia, within a soul group called getting jiggie with it. ? lol

I guess what I'm trying to say is, are there locations within the spirit world, towns, cities, streets, and what dimension/frequency level."

Question:
"Is it important to pay attention to numerology, life path numbers etc? Is this part of sacred geometry?"

Question:
"How many dimensions are there?"

And much more....

<title>Ascension, Atlantis Soul Memories - Sound Healing with Hanna Ehlers </title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Hanna Ehlers</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Today's guest is Hanna Ehlers, a spiritual and metaphysical teacher helping many lightworkers to step on to their chosen pathway.
(Scroll down to listen to the show)

Hanna has dedicated her life to Ascension, personal enlightenment, with knowledge in many spiritual disciplines, methods and therapies. As well as being a competent psychic and channel for intergalactic beings, Ascended Masters and other deities, and different forms of healing, teaching and counselling.

In the show we discussed the following topics:

Memories from Home and The Gaia Project
After awakening abruptly onto her spiritual pathway in Japan, Hanna became aware of lost memories from a life on a different home planet. A much more peaceful existence with beings operating on a much higher level of consciousness, Hanna remembers offering her services to help with the Gaia project, part of an increasing influx of beautiful souls coming in to help push the humanity to a more loving way of being. Many brave souls have come in to help conquer the darkness that has plagued this world since the fall of Atlantis.

Hanna discusses her memories of a voluntary incarnation into Atlantis where her intended purpose was to freely come and go as she pleased back to her home planet once that life time ended. However because of the fall and ensuing control by the dark elite (AKA the New World Order) many souls were trapped here within the Earth grid system.

Ascension - 2012
Hanna discusses her thoughts on Ascension and how it's a process that has to happen internally to us, not by external beings coming in to save us. Hanna has a pure connection to her cosmic team of helpers, ascended masters and members of the Galactic Federation. Hanna agreed that we have to be cautious of some channelled material that suggests our space brothers are going to save us and do the Ascension work for us, or worse, whisked us off to another dimension, this simply isn't the case. There are many loving beings watching and helping us at this time but we have to do the inner work ourselves. Ascension comes from within. 

Sound Healing
Hanna discussed her awakening memories from her home planet where they used Sound Healing to bring harmony back into their aura's and energy fields. Through the guidance of Sound Healer Tom Kenyon, Hanna has now remembered and brought her latent sound healing gifts to the surface. Hanna now regularly provides workshops and therapy sessions using this wonderful and very powerful technique. Hanna gives us a taster at the end of the show.

About Hanna:
Hanna Ehlers is the creator of lightworkersunite.co.uk. She is a metaphysical and spiritual teacher. She has dedicated her life to ascension and personal enlightenment and has been training in many spiritual disciplines, methods and thera

pies for almost five years. Hanna is a competent psychic and channel for intergalactic beings, ascended masters and other deities, additionally she has a background in healing, teaching and counselling. Her approaches, thoughts and beliefs have been learned via teachings from around the globe with many incarnate guides and from her personal journey with oneness and the family of light outside of 3D. Hanna is a qualified healer trained via two institutions, both the National Federation of Spiritual Healers and The Brofman Foundation for the Advancement of Healing. Furthermore she has had the opportunity to undergo training to become an Angel Therapy Practitioner in Hawaii, certified by Doreen Virtue PhD, in addition, Hanna has under gone Sound Healing Training with Tom Kenyon in Seattle under the auspices of Psycho-acoustic Brain Research.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 12 - Journeys into Consciousness- Big Foot, Atlantis, Financial Crisis, Dimensions, Spirit World, Dreams</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show we discussed the following topics: 

The Financial Meltdown
Are we really coming out of the recession as the media would like us to believe or are there more problems on the horizon? 

Big Foot
Contrary what most people might think, these beings are extremely advance and loving. They can be found across the Pacific North West in America, Canada, Mongolia, Tibet and many other places around the world. 
They are a sub species of human which was part of the original stock going back 5 million years ago. They haven't really changed much since then but continue to be very spiritual and in harmony with mother Earth. 
They can dematerialise at will and move in to an overlay reality which allows them to disappear from harms way in a fight or flight situation. By increasing their vibration they can shift themselves just enough to no longer be visible within our field of light. They can still see this reality from their higher vantage point but are no longer in it.

They can communicate through telepathy. 
They live for about 150 years 
Their emotional makeup is loving and harmonic. 

Life on Earth
Gregory touches on how life started on Earth initially with microbes and various minerals being brought here from the collision of another planet and what is now our moon. Gregory said that there are lakes larger than Galaxies containing life moving through our universe. Life on Earth has also been manipulated along the way by other cosmic beings. This accounts for the different branches in the Human species along the way. 

Reality / Dimensions / Spirit World
Gregory discussed the many levels of reality through different vibrations. 
What the spirit world is actually like. 
Different physical realities of a higher nature where beings live in a much more loving and harmonious way. 
How dimensions can collide with each other in different places and cause aircraft and people to cross over to another universe. 

Depressions can build up that cause a portal to open up. We discussed an event that happened where a 727 and it's passengers actually dropped off the radar for ten minutes with no visible sighting from the ground during this time either. 

When the plane landed, all the watches and clocks were out by ten minutes. Gregory confirmed that the plane actually moved in to one of these time clouds and crossed a dimensional barrier. Luckily for the passengers and crew it also returned. 

Different cycles of Human on Earth / Atlantis
There was another more highly advanced spiritual race here around 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. Rather than being very technical in their sciences as we are, their methods were more based on spiritual science. They had magnificent abilities, especially around architecture and human expression. They had the most beautiful structures. Sadly they were lost to severe Earth changes at this time. 

There were other advance beings around this time as well, that lived all over the Earth. These beings were around 3 feet in height. 

Dreams

We discussed what dreams are and the different types 
Working Dreams - Working in spirit while living on Earth 
Dreams as Mirror - Each person in the dream is an aspect of yourself 
Prophetic Dreams 
And Fear Based Dreams 

And much more...

Gregory touches on how life started on Earth initially with microbes and various minerals being brought here from the collision of another planet and what is now our moon. Gregory said that there are lakes larger than Galaxies containing life moving through our universe. Life on Earth has also been manipulated along the way by other cosmic beings. This accounts for the different branches in the Human species along the way. 

Reality / Dimensions / Spirit World
Gregory discussed the many levels of reality through different vibrations. 
What the spirit world is actually like. 
Different physical realities of a higher nature where beings live in a much more loving and harmonious way. 
How dimensions can collide with each other in different places and cause aircraft and people to cross over to another universe. 

Depressions can build up that cause a portal to open up. We discussed an event that happened where a 727 and it's passengers actually dropped off the radar for ten minutes with no visible sighting from the ground during this time either. 

When the plane landed, all the watches and clocks were out by ten minutes. Gregory confirmed that the plane actually moved in to one of these time clouds and crossed a dimensional barrier. Luckily for the passengers and crew it also returned. 

Different cycles of Human on Earth / Atlantis
There was another more highly advanced spiritual race here around 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. Rather than being very technical in their sciences as we are, their methods were more based on spiritual science. They had magnificent abilities, especially around architecture and human expression. They had the most beautiful structures. Sadly they were lost to severe Earth changes at this time. 

There were other advance beings around this time as well, that lived all over the Earth. These beings were around 3 feet in height. 

Dreams

We discussed what dreams are and the different types 
Working Dreams - Working in spirit while living on Earth 
Dreams as Mirror - Each person in the dream is an aspect of yourself 
Prophetic Dreams 
And Fear Based Dreams 

And much more...

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 11 - Obama E.T Disclosure, Spiritual Laws, Mysterious Stones, telekinesis, Law of Free Will, Power of Meditation</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show Gregory discussed the following:
UFO - E.T Disclosure
Insiders / Researchers such as David Wilcock, Michael Salla et al and now other Channellers are all saying that Obama will be disclosing the existance of other E.T races by the end of the year (2009). We discussed this subject along with the announcment by some intel sources via some internet researchers that a large ship is also approcaching Earth which apperently houses a large civilisation, according to Gregory this event is putting huge pressure on goverments to disclose as there will be no hiding the subject once this is visible in our skies in the near future. I was expecting Gregory to debunk this but in fact he seemed to agree this was the case, which is rather interesting.

Also we discussed E.T City&#039;s that exist within our Mountains and under the oceans.

Spiritual Laws
We discussed the laws and how they are actually policed.

Law of Free
Law of Proximity - How spirits can be limited in what they are allowed to see.
Law of Squares - The power of group mind when many sitters focus with love on an intention.

Levitation - Energy Transference Questions

China super psychics and their use of telekinesis to move objects.
Megalithic Stones such as:
Dolmens
2000 ton stone in Ba&#039;albek, Lebanon

Boulders in Trees

In April 1997, a turkey hunter in Yellowwood State Forest, Indiana, came upon a huge sandstone boulder wedged between three branches of an oak tree about 35 feet from the ground. The arrow shaped rock was estimated to weight 500lb. Subsequently, four more large boulders were found wedged high up in trees elsewhere in the forest. All were in remote areas. None of the trees were damaged and there were no signs of heavy equipment begin used or of tornado damage and no one recalled any mishaps involving dynamite anywhere nearby.

Mysterious Sliding Boulders
One of the strangest occurrences that Dr. Bob has ever come across is the mysterious sliding boulders of Death Valley National Park, California. There are trails showing that boulders up to 705 pounds (320 kg) have moved large distances over flat terrain. No one has actually seen these boulders move.


THe Dropa Stones
We briefly touched on the Dropa Stones which will be covered fully in a future show.

The Dropa (also known as Dropas, Drok-pa or Dzopa) are, according to certain controversial writers, a race of dwarf-like extraterrestrials who landed near the Chinese-Tibetan border some twelve thousand years ago. 

The explorers are said to have found many neat rows of tombs with short 138 cm skeletons buried within. The skeletons had abnormally big heads, and small, thin, fragile bodies. A member of the team suggested that these might be the remains of an unknown species of mountain gorilla. 
And much more....

<title>Journeys into Consciousness Show 10 - The Moon Bomb, Earth Quakes, Biblical Angels, Fatima Prophecy, Cosmic Ordering</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show Gregory discussed the following:

The Moon.
We discussed NASA's recent Moon mission in which they crashed space craft in to the south pole of the moon to apparently find evidence of water.

Gregory discussed how the moon was created.

I asked, "are the other planets going through climate change as well?". Gregory pointed out that most of these brightening anomalies are actually caused by us viewing them from our vantage point of Earth. Our atmosphere is thinning dramatically as a result of rapid climate change.


The Earth.
Earth Quakes. We discussed the sudden increase in quakes which are set to continue as Mother Earth is going through a cycle of continued rapid changes that will see some Islands submerged, possible big quakes in the US within the next 3 years, even Italy and Rome which could cause a sudden movement of secret information stored in the Vatican.

Ice Caps - Gulf Stream - Ice Age. We discussed the theory that the northern hemisphere could go in to a mini ice age if the polar ice caps melts. It's theorised that fresh water could stop the gulf stream, which is essential for providing heat for the northern hemisphere. However Gregory felt this wasn't really the main issue to be concerned about as he didn't see much evidence for this. The main cause for concern is the sudden release of millions of tons of carbon which is currently locked in the ice, if it's suddenly released in to the atmosphere then it will cause a very dangerous situation, as we are already in a very fragile situation.

Pole Shift
Fact or Fiction?

The Fatima Mother Mary Predictions.
Mother Mary apparently appeared to three young children in Fatima on October the 13th, 1917. Lucia, Jacinta and Francisco. She gave them three prophecies below. Gregory confirmed that Mother Mary did actually materialise to the children and talked around this.

Info taken from: http://www.crystalinks.com/Fatima.html

"Lucia said the first secret shown to them by Mary began with a terrifying vision of hell. Mary then indicated that the war would soon end, as World War I did in the following year. 

But Mary foresaw that a "night illuminated by an unknown light" would precede a "worse war" in which "The good will be martyred" and "The Holy Father will have much to suffer." On January 25, 1938, a remarkable display of aurora borealis was visible across Europe, the year before World War II began.

The second secret involved the future of Russia. Lucia says Mary revealed that Russia would "spread her errors throughout the world, promoting wars," and that "Various nations will be annihilated." Many believe this is a direct prophecy of the spread of communism. "I shall come to ask for the consecration of Russia to My Immaculate Heart," continues the account of Mary's revelation. "If people attend to My requests, Russia will be converted and the world will have peace." Some interpret Pope John Paul II's 1984 consecration of Russia as fulfilling the prophecy, and paving the way for the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union as the "conversion" of Russia. 
Lucia wrote down the third secret, sealed it, and entrusted it to Portugal's Bishop of Leiria, with instructions that it was not to be read until 1960. The Bishop turned the envelope over to the Vatican. Pope John XXIII reportedly opened the envelope when 1960 arrived, but refused to divulge its contents, saying, "This prophecy does not relate to my time." Pope John Paul II is said to have also read it, and refuses to reveal it on the grounds that its true spiritual message has been obscured by sensationalism. "

The Vatican - Hidden Secrets.
We discussed the hidden secrets located in the Vatican. Gregory discussed the hidden information. We also talked about the Library of Alexandria which was destroyed to keep humanity ignorant. The library contained many revealing and powerful secrets.

Cosmic Ordering - Law of Attraction.
We had some very good questions from one of our listeners on this subject which Gregory answered for us:

1... With all due respect to anyone's beliefs, there does seem to be in some spiritual peoples thinking that "spirit " can do anything for them, i.e., my guide will get a car parking space for me, spirit will provide me with the money for a course I want to go on, etc, etc, and I think its time that people are made aware of exactly what spirit can do, will do, or maybe what they are allowed to do in order to help people.

2....There is and has been for a while, some books, cards, courses etc, that are called, Universal ordering/cosmic ordering, where if one visualises, and believes that what they want will come to fruition, and I need to know from Gregory if this type of human concept is true? On the physical plane, and how that may differ to the concept of spirit thinking of something and having it materialise, i.e. Gregory would like a chair to sit on, can he think of a chair, visualise it, and it appears? 

Biblical Angels - Gregory confirmed that the accounts mentioned in the bible of Chariots coming from the sky were in fact extraterrestrials. Ezekiel talks about living creatures flying within wheels within wheels. Humans at that time would have viewed these as Gods or Angels when in fact they were extraterrestrial in origin. We also discussed the Annunaki written about the Sumerian text.

Freemasonry - Gregory discussed the origins of Freemasonry from Egypt and how the Mason's started out building the pharaoh's tombs using secret divine knowledge. The Mason's would be killed after the Pharaoh was buried so not to reveal what they knew regarding the construction of the tomb. Obviously this became a concern for the Mason's so they setup a secret agreement not to divulge any information and become free to live their lives, hence they became Free Mason's and could practice what they knew as long as it remained secret. This knowledge has been passed down ever since and kept from the masses.

And much more....

<title>2012, Credit Crunch, Global Warming, Awakening with Chris Bourne, discover the higher perspective</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Chris Bourne</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In this show we discuss the following topics:

1. What is Ascension.

2. How does it relate to 2012.

3. What can we expect to happen to society and humanity as we continue through the process.

4. The concept of Unity and Separation and how consciousness set about knowing itself through separation and awareness.

5. How we are now moving away from Seperation and back to Unity.

6. Chris' science background allows him to combine esoteric principles with quantum physics, both compliment each over beautifully.

7. What can you do to be in the flow and be apart of this wonderful process.

At the end of the show Chris shares his vision for the future and how the process may unfold in our 3rd dimensional reality.

At the start of the show Chris talks about is near death experience which culminated in his awakening experience. Chris was taken to multiple dimensions of reality where he realised just how important every aspect of his life had been up to that point. Quote from Chris below:

"During the crash, time seemed to slow right down and I was guided back through key moments of my life. I was realising that every moment in our lives has but one underlying purpose - to reveal an aspect of truth about ourselves to ourselves. I was beginning to dissolve every belief and value our society had conditioned within me." 

"This was my initial awakening to the magical unifying consciousness of the soul. Over the five years that followed, I was guided through four other inner 'Gateways' of consciousness. I have since come to know the process as the five key expansions on our journey of Enlightenment and ultimate Ascension into multi dimensional living - our divine birthright".

Also in the show Chris discusses the five gateways or initiations somebody could find themselves going through as they knowingly or unknowingly set foot on to the ascension pathway.

1. What is Ascension.

2. How does it relate to 2012.

3. What can we expect to happen to society and humanity as we continue through the process.

4. The concept of Unity and Separation and how consciousness set about knowing itself through separation and awareness.

5. How we are now moving away from Seperation and back to Unity.

6. Chris' science background allows him to combine esoteric principles with quantum physics, both compliment each over beautifully.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 9 - Questions from Listeners, 911, Mary Celeste, Psychic Protection</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Spirit Guide Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Gregory discussed the following questions from our previous show where he needed clarity from other beings within the spirit world.

911 - Investigation in to the buildings collapse.
What really happened to the ghost ship, mary celeste

In this show Gregory answered the following questions:

Question:
I would like to know why it is that our spirit guides cant stop some people becoming possessed by spirits that can latch on to them, and what happens to people when they pass over who practise black magic, which can very often affect Innocent people in a really bad way. Also what is the best way of protecting against psychic attack? 

Question:
A lot of people seem to be stuck spiritually and not sure where their path is leading them to, they don't seem to have definitive direction, what advice would you have for them?

Question:
Gregory, you speak of and refer so often to GOD as being the creator of all etc, however why therefore do so many Spirits state that GOD is merely a man-made title in order to give mankind a faith and belief structure where in reality the higher conciousness is made of more than a singular being?

Question:
Could you ask Gregory, what he thinks of people ending there lives, by going abroad?

Question:
Is it necessary to sit in meditation a lot in-order to increase ones ability as a medium, and from your knowledge is mediumship a gift we are born with or can it be developed?

<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Dr Kevin Emery</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show we discussed the follow:

Spiritual activism and the dangers of apathy within the spiritual community

His book, Combing The Mirror, and other steps in your spiritual path.

Kevin discusses one of the book's chapters where he goes into Soul Groups, Soul Agreements, Reincarnation, taking personal responsilbilty and also checking your belief systems or BS for short to see if you are believing in something that no longer serves you.

Book info:

Combing the Mirror (and other Steps in Your Spiritual Path)
by Dr. Kevin Ross Emery
ISBN 1-890405-20-5

This light-hearted book takes an in-depth look at how to address the patterns in your life which keep you disempowered. Learn to release your past, stay present in your present and create the future you deserve and desire. Filled with experiential exercises, this book allows the reader to learn and apply the techniques that Dr. Emery has used for many years in his successful spiritual counseling and spiritual coaching work.

Through simple, yet powerful techniques train yourself to take back your life. This book forms the basis of the powerful Combing The Mirror Coaching (TM) sessions in which participants work with a trained coach, in person or via telephone, to help apply the exercises contained in the book.

Unlike many "self-help" books, Combing The Mirror addresses the issue that information without action is useless. Thus, the issues discussed and uncovered in the book are linked with powerful; practical exercises designed to help the reader actualize the insights they receive.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness 8 - 9-11, Ouija Boards, Multiple Dimensions, Mysterious Events</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show we discussed the following:

9-11
A need for a new open and truthful investigation in to what happened.

China mass UFO Sighting
Confirming the mass UFO sighting in China witnessed by millions of people. Surprisingly China could be the vanguard in so many ways helping us build a more open and honest future.

Ouija Boards
Gregory talks about the extreme dangers of using Ouija Boards and other similar open methods of contact. 

Deja vu
Gregory gives us an insight in to what Deja vu is. He gave a wonderful description that it is our pure beautiful spirit experiencing the world when we find ourselves in this state. 

Bermuda Triangle
Gregory discussed all the converging factors of magnetic and electronic anomalies, shallow waters and impromptu violent storms in the area that has led to the disappearance of so many ships and planes.

Loch Ness Monster / Dragons
Gregory confirmed that the Loch Ness Monster does exist. There are in fact many of them, left over from prehistoric times, much like crocodiles and other birds are. Amazingly Gregory also confirmed the existence of many species of large Dragon still existing in many parts of China.

Vanishing into Nothing, other dimensions, the OZ Factor
Gregory also discussed the concepts around vanishing people and time storms where people suddenly view a scene from the past or see other subtle differences from another similar universe. The fabric of space/time can become thin in certain areas where universes or other dimensions collide.

Stumble into Nothingness 
It's difficult to dismiss such incredible stories when they take place in front of eyewitnesses. 

This case began as a harmless bet among friends, but ended in tragic mystery. In 1873, James Worson of Leamington Spa, England, was a simple shoemaker who also fancied himself somewhat of an athlete. One fine day, James made a bet with a few of his friends that he could run non-stop from Leamington Spa to Coventry. Knowing that this was a good 16 miles, his friends readily took the bet. As James began to jog at a moderate pace toward Coventry, his friends climbed into a horse-drawn cart to follow him and protect their bet. James did well for the first few miles. 
then his friends saw him trip on something and fall forward... but never hit the ground. Instead, James completely vanished. Astonished and doubting their own eyes, his friends looked for him without success, then raced back to Leamington Spa to inform the police. An investigation turned up nothing. James Worson had run into oblivion. (From Into Thin Air, by Paul Begg)

Left Brain / Right Brain and what creates our personality
Gregory discusses how we experience consciousness when the left part of the brain is switched off. This is the part of the brain that gives us the concept of 1 on 1 or where we understand the limits of our physical selves, time and distance. Without it we would float in pure oneness and bliss with no concept of separation.

And much more....]]></description>

<title>Journeys into Consciousness Show 7 - Moon Landing, UFOs, E.Ts, Disclosure, Visiting Races, Crop Circ</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[E.T Races (Raptures, Greys)
Gregory also confirmed that there is a race of Raptures that had been here at one time, not a particularly nice race by all accounts as they can be extremely manipulative and self serving with little or no emotions. These sound very similar to the Reptilians spoken about by David Icke. However there are other extremely friendly races visiting us as well who have been here a very long time, most groups have a vested interest in our spiritual evolution. However we do need to be discerning as there are still other self serving groups who would love nothing better than for us to destroy ourselves. He also confirmed that the Greys were and still are involved in abductions for their own means.

Moon Landings - 5 Mile Ships
Gregory confirmed that the Moon landings had been closely watched by other E.T races. The astronauts witnessed other worldly craft that stretched over 5 miles in length.
 
Titan's Artificial Moon
In our previous show, Gregory discussed Buzz Aldrin's exposure of a monolith that's apparently on a moon orbiting Mars. Following on from that show Gregory expanded on this by also confirming that Titan (Saturn's moon) has an abandoned artificial moon orbiting it. A left over relic from a long ago civilisation that had been operating in the area.


Phoenix Lights
Gregory confirmed the appearance of this huge triangular shaped organic craft that was seen by hundreds of people over Phoenix in the United States. The ship was manned by humanoid type beings. The ship is organic in structure and reacts to thought.

Mexico
Many sightings seem to happen in Mexico with thousands of people witnessing incredible open displays of E.T craft in their skies all the time. The government and people there are much more open to these events, could these be why they appear there so often. They really want to be seen, the rest of the world really needs to wake up to the greater reality. I suggested that it would be nice if they just showed up in the skies of London, that would certainly do the trick, however Gregory confirmed that this approach would be extremely dangerous for this visiting and us. Many factions within power do not want this subject out. Many of the disclosures that are happening in the UK are apparently being done to just put these pieces to bed, remove the mystery by putting into the public eye, add a sceptical slant and then just hope it goes away. 

Roswell 1947
Gregory confirmed that two craft did in fact crash in Roswell and retrieved by the military. 
 
Rendlesham Forest 1980
The UK Government have recently released classified files regarding this incident that was witnessed by highly credible military personal from the UK and the US. He confirmed that they had also touched the craft as well so experienced the event with all the senses. What the describe did take place, it's a shame that the BBC had chosen to debunk it in their news reports as officers playing a hoax on their colleagues.
 
Crop Circles
Gregory confirmed that Crop Circles are indeed real and that they are made by many positive visiting E.T groups as well as the spirit world. They are encoding geometric information in  crop circles about our Solar System and new ways of learning about our reality. We should take note!!]]></description>
<itunes:subtitle>E.T Races (Raptures, Greys)
Gregory also confirmed that there is a race of Raptures that had been here at one time, not a particularly nice race by all accounts as they can be extremely manipulative and self serving with little or no emotions. These sound very similar to the Reptilians spoken about by David Icke. However there are other extremely friendly races visiting us as well who have been here a very long time, most groups have a vested interest in our spiritual evolution. However we do need to be discerning as there are still other self serving groups who would love nothing better than for us to destroy ourselves. He also confirmed that the Greys were and still are involved in abductions for their own means.

Moon Landings - 5 Mile Ships
Gregory confirmed that the Moon landings had been closely watched by other E.T races. The astronauts witnessed other worldly craft that stretched over 5 miles in length.
 
Titan's Artificial Moon
In our previous show, Gregory discussed Buzz Aldrin's exposure of a monolith that's apparently on a moon orbiting Mars. Following on from that show Gregory expanded on this by also confirming that Titan (Saturn's moon) has an abandoned artificial moon orbiting it. A left over relic from a long ago civilisation that had been operating in the area.


Phoenix Lights
Gregory confirmed the appearance of this huge triangular shaped organic craft that was seen by hundreds of people over Phoenix in the United States. The ship was manned by humanoid type beings. The ship is organic in structure and reacts to thought.

Mexico
Many sightings seem to happen in Mexico with thousands of people witnessing incredible open displays of E.T craft in their skies all the time. The government and people there are much more open to these events, could these be why they appear there so often. They really want to be seen, the rest of the world really needs to wake up to the greater reality. I suggested that it would be nice if they just showed up in the skies of London, that would certainly do the trick, however Gregory confirmed that this approach would be extremely dangerous for this visiting and us. Many factions within power do not want this subject out. Many of the disclosures that are happening in the UK are apparently being done to just put these pieces to bed, remove the mystery by putting into the public eye, add a sceptical slant and then just hope it goes away.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness Show 6 - What is the Akashic Records, Halls of Learning, UFO Disclosure</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Gregory Haye</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[In today's show Gregory discussed in details what the Akashic Records are used for and how they relate to our soul journey here on Earth and across the universe.
Does the Akashic records contain our future?
Where are they? what is their connection to the Hall's of Learning.
How do they work? Where are they?

Gregory also discussed his perspective on past lives and regression and how most memories can be linked to souls on a same loving wave length as us within our soul groups.

At the end of the show Gregory discussed: 
The knowledgeable work of the Melchizedek group as well as the OPAC group. 
The importance of discernment when channelling or reading information as their are negative agenda's being played out by not only negative spirits but also negative E.T's. There are 500 species within our neighbourhood, some good and some not so good, so we have to be very careful what we choose to read. Positively oriented beings will not break our free will, however those of a negative polarity whether human or extraterrestrial will seek to take our power and free will. We also discussed the recent quote from astronaut Buzz Aldrin who recently quoted the following on record:

"We should go boldly where man has not gone before, fly by the comets, visit asteroids, visit the moon of Mars. There's a monolith there. A very unusual structure on this little potato shaped object that goes around Mars once in seven hours. When people find out about that, they're going to say "Who put that there?" Well, the universe put it there. If you choose, God put it there."

Gregory confirmed that the monoliths do actually exist and Buzz is speaking the truth, he also confirmed them to be on Saturn's moon Titan also. We spoke about the need for Disclosure on the UFO subject and Gregory agreed that the time is now right for Disclosure to happen and should happen, there is no reason anymore to cover it up.

We will aim to dedicate a show to this subject next time.]]></description>

<title>Dr Kevin Talks About The Lost Steps of Reiki Channelled via a 5000 Year Old Tibetan Shaman</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones / Dr Kevin Ross Emery</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Dr Kevin talks about a form of Reiki Healing that was shared with him through the act of trance channelling, in 1995 by Wei Chi, a Tibetan shaman, who walked the earth plane 5,000 years ago. Wei Chi brought forth a much more interactive, client participatory and extensive form of the healing art that we call Reiki. Over a four month time period, Dr Kevin's life was dominated by Wei Chi channelling through him from which came the book The Lost Steps Of Reiki - The Channelled Teachings of Wei Chi. Since 1996, Wei Chi has been working with Dr Kevin to help bring, as fully as possible, the modern version of what was given to him by a Master which today we call, "Wei Chi Tibetan Reiki".

<description><![CDATA[In tonight's show we discussed the following topics:

Whether souls choose their parents before they are born.

Does Gregory believe that the amount of time and focus the media (radio, TV, magazines and newspapers) devote to diseases such as cancer is actually manifesting more of the diseases they are attempting to eradicate?

Gregory's give us his true position on global warming.

Gregory was asked, "Have there, of your knowledge/known, ever been any metaphysical manifestations associated with the Necromicon spell book?"

The question was asked "Why did Michael Jackson had to die, as he gave so much love into the world and raised us up with his music. Will his children be ok?"

Do the deceased live on Earth in another dimension ?

A question on foregiveness.

Are spirit able to immediately or within a couple of days of passing able to come back within the same family?

<title>Experiment Earth - History of Atlantis and Lemuria with Intuitive Dr Kevin Ross Emery</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[Today's guest is Dr Kevin Ross Emery. 
Dr Kevin's work in the esoteric and spiritual counseling field is as diverse as they come, with multiple books published, most notably a book detailing a lost form of ancient Reiki channelled from via a 5000 year old Tibetan monk called Wei Chi and a book called "Experiment Earth" which chronicles the lost civilizations of Atlantis, Lemuria and the reason world events have played out ever since. Dr Kevin is also a established and experiences spiritual coach and counselor helping children and adults with ADD and ADHD.

In this show Dr Kevin focuses on the history of Atlantis and Lemuria, what is was like, why it was destroyed and what the beings who inhabited the continent were like. He also discusses the various techniques of trance that he uses to bring the information forward. We also discussed the parallels with our world today where we are pretty much headed in the same direction with advanced technology, but are we still spiritually responsible enough to use them? 

Experiment Earth: Journey Back to The Beginning

An exciting adventure, tracing the appearance of several channeled entities with messages about the purpose of Earth as a cosmic experiment, the status of that experiment, the place of angels in our lives and much more. Interlaced throughout this story are the words of the Native American Council of Grandmothers, Wei Chi, Ezekiel, Ki (an outspoken extraterrestrial) and even the words of Mother Earth herself! 

Set against the backdrop of two traveling, metaphysical healers and their personal quest for greater enlightenment, this book is sure to excite your imagination and quench your thirst for the knowledge about why we are all here on this planet known throughout the universe as Experiment: Earth.

In this show Dr Kevin focuses on the history of Atlantis and Lemuria, what is was like, why it was destroyed and what the beings who inhabited the continent were like. He also discusses the various techniques of trance that he uses to bring the information forward. We also discussed the parallels with our world today where we are pretty much headed in the same direction with advanced technology, but are we still spiritually responsible enough to use them? 

Experiment Earth: Journey Back to The Beginning

An exciting adventure, tracing the appearance of several channeled entities with messages about the purpose of Earth as a cosmic experiment, the status of that experiment, the place of angels in our lives and much more. Interlaced throughout this story are the words of the Native American Council of Grandmothers, Wei Chi, Ezekiel, Ki (an outspoken extraterrestrial) and even the words of Mother Earth herself! 

Set against the backdrop of two traveling, metaphysical healers and their personal quest for greater enlightenment, this book is sure to excite your imagination and quench your thirst for the knowledge about why we are all here on this planet known throughout the universe as Experiment: Earth.

<title>Journeys into Consciousness Show 4 - with Gregory, Earth Special</title>
<itunes:author>Ian Jones</itunes:author>
<link>http://TheSpiritGuides.co.uk/radio</link>
<description><![CDATA[There have been a number of press releases in various countries of late suggesting that their residents have an emergency grab bag ready in the event of a catastrophe or emergency. I asked Gregory his view on this as it made me wonder if the PowersAtBe knew something. Gregory confirmed that a serious real threat of attack is one reason these reports are being given out, especially at the moment with potentials for a nuclear threat around nations such as Iran, North Korea and Israel. 

The show also focussed on other serious issues regarding our environment and ecosystems, although we are going through a time of transformation and more people are waking up, it's vitally important that we group together and help raise awareness of the dire situation our oceans, environment and ecosystems are in. 

Very soon people will feel the affects of our abuse on the environment where it will no longer be something dismissed by people. It will affect everybody personally with rising sea levels and a food chain collapse within our oceans. W e are rapidly changing the balance of life within our oceans due to increased pollution and acidity that could lead to disastrous consequences. He mentioned that we only have 17 years to fix our polluted environment before a tipping point is reached and our planet is irreversible. 

I voiced concern that people are reactive and don't tend to do anything unless it affects them, however he said that the young children know about the issues and know what's going on. So, will we be lazy enough to leave it to them? I feel our children and history will judge us rather harshly if we don't get our act together. Everybody has a role but we need to get the information out so everybody can wake up and do their special piece of the puzzle.

We also discussed again the issues around the Sun and why there is no sun spot activity even though we are well into solar cycle 24. Also, how the sun is actually very frantic at the moment but we just can't see it. It is having an impact on us, it;'s also affecting the Jet Stream, electronics and our weather.

We also touched on the indigenous cultures who have been banding together to help usher in a world of peace. And tragically how these peaceful people's have been fighting a secret war with corporate groups and governments hell bent on destroying their land for oil and other minerals. Many people have been killed on both sides of this secret war. However nothing is being reported in the controlled main stream media. It's important that we all get the word out. We can't afford more areas of our rain forests to be destroyed by these people as it will tip the balance even quicker. Greenpeace are doing a wonderful job of raising awareness around these kinds of issues but need more support.

Gregory also gives his perspective on other entities watching the Earth as the question was put to Gregory regarding the Galactic Federation who are a group of entities keeping an eye on things here. However, we have to be discerning as there are positive and negative groups with differing interests.

We also discussed, free energy, the work of Nikola Tesla, Synchronicity around numbers and patterns and much more.
