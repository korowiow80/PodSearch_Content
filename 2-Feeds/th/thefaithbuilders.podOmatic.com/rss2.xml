      <title>To Pray or To Punch</title>
      <description>It can be incredibly difficult, as a parent, to watch our child suffer at the hands of a bully. We want to take action, to protect our child, to strike back at whatever and whoever is hurting our child. Kimberli Brackett, Faithbuilder Co-founder, shares her experience with this important issue in a humorous, but oh-so-honest way that will have you smiling, have you thinking, and hopefully...have you praying. What DO we do when faced with the option...to pray or to punch?</description>

      <title>The Voice of Truth</title>
      <description>Through the simple, heart-warming sound of her child singing, Faithbuilder Co-Founder Kimberli Brackett hears a message for all of us from our Heavenly Father to listen for the sound of his voice. It's hard to sort through the many voices screaming at us throughout the day, demanding our attention. God wants us to &quot;choose to listen and believe the voice of truth.&#8221; </description>
