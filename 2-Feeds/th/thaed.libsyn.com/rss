<p>Back in 2008, after being a fan of the show since the beginning, I emailed Thaed and asked him if I could be on the show.

Looking back, I understand his reasoning, but I would have never thought that my first appearance on the show would be as it's host. I am deeply honored for this opportunity and am very excited to be able to take part in the continuation of such a wonderfully intellectual and eclectic podcast with a group of such interesting and creative hosts as it's new host and producer.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[--Economic down-turn and Open Source. &nbsp;Will it help or hurt?<br/>
<br/>
--(From David)&nbsp; &quot;The big things don't love you back. &nbsp;They take and<br/>
take, and never give in return. &nbsp;They'll drain your blood, your soul,<br/>
and never let you go.&quot;&nbsp; The Postman by David Brin.<br/>
<br/>
--If your lifestyle uses a lot of gas and electricity, but you can<br/>
afford it, should you change your lifestyle to conserve energy? Say<br/>
you like driving Hummers, your house costs a fortune to heat and you<br/>
run a hot tub year round. But you have the money, so it has no impact<br/>
on you financially? &nbsp;Is this wrong?<br/>
<br/>
--In his book &quot;Brain Rules&quot; John Medina advocates putting treadmills<br/>
in the classroom because exercise improves mental acuity. &nbsp;He believes<br/>
ancient humans walked 12 miles a day and we should too. &nbsp;Is this<br/>
workable?<br/>
<br/>
--Contests held to improve technology dates back to contests in<br/>
England to see who could design the best locomotive. &nbsp;Now, we have<br/>
DARPA prizes, the X-Prize and a host of others. &nbsp;Should there be a<br/>
prize for every single societal problem? &nbsp;Should we have a cure<br/>
malaria prize? &nbsp;A stop homelessness prize?<br/>
<br/>
--(From Jason) Big corporations are using viral media like &quot;leaked<br/>
videos&quot; (which are actually produced) like the Kobe Bryant kiddie pool<br/>
dunk video from Nike and the &quot;fake&quot; music videos which pretend to be<br/>
indie but are actually backed by a major record label. &nbsp;Are major<br/>
commercial and advertising studios intimidated by the amateur video &amp;<br/>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[--Economic down-turn and Open Source. &nbsp;Will it help or hurt?

--(From David)&nbsp; &quot;The big things don't love you back. &nbsp;They take and
take, and never give in return. &nbsp;They'll drain your blood, your soul,
and never let you go.&quot;&nbsp; The Postman by David Brin.

--If your lifestyle uses a lot of gas and electricity, but you can
afford it, should you change your lifestyle to conserve energy? Say
you like driving Hummers, your house costs a fortune to heat and you
run a hot tub year round. But you have the money, so it has no impact
on you financially? &nbsp;Is this wrong?

--In his book &quot;Brain Rules&quot; John Medina advocates putting treadmills
in the classroom because exercise improves mental acuity. &nbsp;He believes
ancient humans walked 12 miles a day and we should too. &nbsp;Is this
workable?

--Contests held to improve technology dates back to contests in
England to see who could design the best locomotive. &nbsp;Now, we have
DARPA prizes, the X-Prize and a host of others. &nbsp;Should there be a
prize for every single societal problem? &nbsp;Should we have a cure
malaria prize? &nbsp;A stop homelessness prize?

--(From Jason) Big corporations are using viral media like &quot;leaked
videos&quot; (which are actually produced) like the Kobe Bryant kiddie pool
dunk video from Nike and the &quot;fake&quot; music videos which pretend to be
indie but are actually backed by a major record label. &nbsp;Are major
commercial and advertising studios intimidated by the amateur video &amp;
audio movement?

---Do people interact with their neighbors anymore? &nbsp;Is is seasonal?<br/>
Does the internet allow like minded people to seek each other out to a<br/>
greater level of articulation than ever before? &nbsp;Does that destroy the<br/>
idea of local community? &nbsp;Was there ever such a thing as local<br/>

Nurture objectively speaking. What dictates human behavior more?<br/><br/>--Klingon, Leet Speak, Nerdish and Esperanto. If we can agree what constitutes a language, are these languages? Should people bother trying to create artificial human languages? Is the goal of a universal lingua franca a meaningful goal? Why or why not?<br/><br/>--Shakespeare v. Marlowe v. everyone else.&nbsp; Do you think Shakespeare was a real person? Do you think he stole from other playwrights? Which of the plays is your favorite and why? <br/><br/>--Oak Trees that grow as fast as bamboo; corn cobs full of gasoline. Think of at least two things that could be genetically engineered to make the world better if ethics were no obstacle. <br/><br/>Sites where you can find more information about Scott, Rym and Thaed:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.frontrowcrew.com/">http://www.frontrowcrew.com</a><br/><a href="http://www.mentalinterface.net/">http://www.mentalinterface.net</a><br/><br/><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=136377040">Subscribe via iTunes.</a><br/><br/>Email Thaed at thaed@cox.net<br/>Follow Thaed on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/thaed">Twitter</a>.<br/>]]></description>

Which of the plays is your favorite and why? --Oak Trees that grow as fast as bamboo; corn cobs full of gasoline.

<p>–What is the nature of motivation?&nbsp; Is it genetic?&nbsp; Does the environment cause it?&nbsp; Why do we like to do the things we like to do? Why do we like to do some things and then move away from them and on to other things?&nbsp; (15:47)</p>

<p>–Planes, trains and automobiles (and also bicycles, snow mobiles, etc.)&nbsp; Given all the time in the world, what’s you’re favorite mode of transportation and why?&nbsp; (30:08)</p>
<p>–Speaking of transportation, China launched it’s Sky train this week connecting Bejing to Tibet.&nbsp; At some points, it is 16,000 feet above sea-level and rests on permafrost.&nbsp; What great engineering projects would you like to see the U.S. government undertake?&nbsp; (37:43)</p>

<p>–Who are your top 3 least favorite celebrities and why?&nbsp; (34:00)</p>

<p>Have you seen Amazon.com's Automated Turk project?&nbsp; Essentially you can labor intensive work at low cost throughout the world.&nbsp; I am working on setting up a project under this program.&nbsp; Have you ever done any work like this or assigned work out through the internet?</p>
<p>Fortuitious follow up.</p>
<p>Should movies made from books, stories or even comic books stay true to the original source material or should it be free to go way out on it's own?</p>
<p>Did you ever have a difficult boss?&nbsp; Why was this person difficult?&nbsp; Share some examples with us.&nbsp; What did you do to cope with this person?</p>
<p>Who were your role models growing up?&nbsp; How about now?</p>
<p>How much time do you spend on line every week?&nbsp; Do you visit the same sites all the time or are you always looking for new ones.</p>
<p>There was a big blow to the Space Elevator recently when it was discovered that carbon nanotubes might not be able to handle the job.&nbsp; What do you think about the Space Elevator concept?&nbsp; Will it ever get off the ground?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Here are the topics for Friday Night Party Line, June 2, 2006.&nbsp; Some of these are from last week because we didn’t get to them.&nbsp; Thanks to Allie, David, Nathan, Indy and Josh for doing the show and setting the current FNPL record for the most guests in one evening.&nbsp; It was a lot of fun!</p>
<p>Imagine yourself being 10 years old again.&nbsp; Would your 10 year old self find you to be cool today? </p>
<p>I wonder if what one really enjoys in life can be distilled to one day. Can you describe your ultimate day? Can you think of how you would take the things you enjoy in life and put them all into one day, assuming you could do anything you want?</p>
<p>People are putting up videos of their children being born on YouTube.&nbsp; I'm all for childbirth and all that, but do we really need to see the live event??&nbsp;&nbsp; Would you do that?&nbsp; Have people send such video links to you?&nbsp; Have you seen these things?</p>
<p>There is a new friend making service called fo.rtuito.us.&nbsp; It's not a dating site.&nbsp; It gives you a new friend every 4 days without regard to gender, age, etc.&nbsp; You communicate with this person back and forth and decide if you want to keep them as a friend.&nbsp; Would you try such a site?</p>
<p>There is another website that just came out called stalkerati.com.&nbsp; From the digg.com website:&nbsp; “You type in the name of a friend and it will run searches on MySpace, Friendster, Facebook and more. Create profiles on your friends and save them to your &quot;buddy list&quot;, then you can just click their name and see all their profiles later on! The buddy list also shows you who's online by checking their IM statuses.?</p>
<p>Have you ever written a complaint to a company about something?&nbsp; Do you do it often?&nbsp; Have you ever gone further and filed a complaint with the company’s regulator?&nbsp; How did it work out for you?</p>
<p>At the University of Florida, the police there have become a fan of the fiction of a certain graduate student.&nbsp; After reading his horror fiction on Live Journal, they've asked him to submit fingerprints and DNA.&nbsp; What are your thoughts on this?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>A special thank you to our guests:&nbsp; Molly, Kelly &amp; David.</p>
<p>Here are this week's topics:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The summer blockbuster movie schedule is fast upon us.&nbsp; There's lots of mutant and superhero action coming and plenty of comedy and adventure too.&nbsp; What movies are you looking forward to this summer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Do you do any sort of exercise or physical activity that requires training or special skills?&nbsp; How did you come to take it up?&nbsp; What makes you keep doing it?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; I had the occasion to see Itzhak Perlman play this week.&nbsp; In my mind, he defines the term virtuoso.&nbsp; He takes his natural gifts and fulfills their potential.&nbsp; What examples of virtuosity have you seen in your experiences?&nbsp; Is it ultimately better to be a master of something or to be merely good at many things?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Do you ever think humans will be able to stop the aging process?&nbsp; Would you take advantage of it if we had the technology?&nbsp; Would you have surgery to make yourself look younger?&nbsp; How far would you go?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Few people would run their lives based on astrology, yet just as we have fun opening fortune cookies, most of us know our our astrological signs.&nbsp; Some of us may even know a bit more.&nbsp; Do you ever say &quot;that explains a lot&quot; when you find out someone's sign?&nbsp; Do you read your horoscope at least every once in a while?&nbsp; Why does astrology still have enough pull today to appear in the newspaper?</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; On NewScientist.com, there's an article about a new robot suit &quot;that could help older people or those with disabilities to walk or lift heavy objects.&quot;&nbsp; This suit is sleeker and less cumbersome than some of the bulky things that have been available in the past.&nbsp; Is the age of the iron man here?&nbsp; Have you seen the YouTube video of the guy with these spring stilts on his feet jumping around Las Vegas?&nbsp; It's just another example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Men and cartoons.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; There's an article from the AP this week that says women can look at a guy's face and tell which guy is interested in becoming a father.&nbsp; Then they can also which ones they are interested in for &quot;short term romantic partners.&quot;&nbsp; Is this real?</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Generally speaking, women live longer than men.&nbsp; I have an article that claims to know why.&nbsp; Why do you think that is?</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; I put up a link in my del.icio.us to peekvid.com.&nbsp; It's television shows that you can watch online.&nbsp; They have 24, Boston Legal, The Daily Show even Thundercats!&nbsp; I'm not sure that that site is particularly legal, but there are lots of sites that are.&nbsp; I have a computer hooked up to a television upstairs.&nbsp; Is the average person going to start watching TV from&nbsp;his or&nbsp;her&nbsp;computers with content delivered from the internet?&nbsp; </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<div class="entry"><p>They say that 16,000 species face extinction. What does this actually mean? How many species go extinct naturally and how many are directly attributable to man? How can we actually test for extinction? Is there workable middle ground on this topic?&nbsp; (1:16)</p>
<p>Eccentricity, idiosyncrasy and genius. How are these character traits related? Have you ever met a highly intelligent or creative person who is mostly normal? Is it true that in order to be creative one must walk the line of insanity?&nbsp; (10:42)</p>
