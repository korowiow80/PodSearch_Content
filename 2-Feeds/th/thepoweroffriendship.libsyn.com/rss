            <description><![CDATA[Beauty and the Beast is a 1991 Disney animated film that is part of the Disney rennaiisance.&nbsp; It is an adaption of the fairytale Beauty and the Beast.&nbsp; This version is quite different from the original, but still keeps the essential themes of looking beyond the surface and not judging a book by its cover.
Melanie likes the film and Kasey doesn't.&nbsp; On one hand, it's a very beautifully animated film that's rich in detail.&nbsp; The themes it portrays are universal and it has a good message for children to learn.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand... Belle is such a Mary Sue.&nbsp; A completely and totally mary freakin sue.&nbsp; And the couple fall deeply in love in like a week.&nbsp; Sure that's improvement upon love at first sight but...
What do you think of Beauty and the Beast? Was Kasey's hate for Belle justified?&nbsp; Does Gaston's friend Lafou really have a gay crush on him?&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us know what you think!

			<title>The Hobbit (1977)</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thepoweroffriendship/FMP-041-TheHobbit1977.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This time around we review the 1977 animated film The Hobbit. The Hobbit was adapted from a 1937 Tolkien book of the same name by Rankin-Bass. Rankin-Bass were the same production/creative team that also created The Last Unicorn, and all of the stop motion holiday classics that ABC Family shoves down Americans throats every winter.
This production was a made for tv movie for children and it shows in the final product. The animation is stilted and the movie does its best to avoid showing violence while still oddly implying it. The budget restraints of a made for tv movie are pretty apparent. The animation is stilted and a large scale war between multiple armies is depicted like a giant dust cloud. However, there was obvious love for the source material in the production. The art design is quite nice. Top Craft, the japanese studio the animation was filmed at, created some really beautiful hand painted backgrounds. They production company also respected the source material and didn't try to add to or dramatically change the story. Despite it's short comings, they did the best they could with a tv movie's budget and time.
Should you see this? If you've read The Hobbit before by all means go for it. It makes a fun diversion while waiting for the Peter Jackson version. If you haven't read the books give it a pass and wait for the live action movies.]]></description>

			<title>Addams Family Values</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/addams-family-values]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Website: http://fantasymoviepodcast.com
The Addams Family Values is a 1993 sequel to the 1991 Addams Family film. All of the actors from the previous film reprise their roles plus there's a brand new Addams baby. The Addams new baby is a dark haired chubby cheeked baby boy that is somehow born with a mustache. In addition, a buxom blond serial killer, played by Joan Cusak, is after Uncle Fester's life and money. The Addams also make the mistake of sending Wednesday and Pugsley to summer camp. Stuff gets set on fire.
This is a shorter episode than normal. We recorded an hour of podcast, but I guess twenty minutes of that was just us going 'uhhhhh, ummmm'. This is a great movie that surpasses the first movie. This is one of the rare instances that a sequel is better than the original. The extremely sturdy baby is a hilarious edition and all of the actors bring their A game. The casting is so perfect. Christini Ricci definitely steals the show though as Wednesday Addams. The camp play her and Pugsley are in is the thing of legends. There's some great satire hidden in here too along with all of the morbidly hilarious jokes. If you liked the last Addams Family movie you''ll love this one.

			<title>Merlin Season 3 - 4</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thepoweroffriendship/FMP-039-Merlin3-4.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Merlin, aka. The Adventures of Merlin, is a British television show that started in 2008. It stars Colin Morgan as a young Merlin who must hide his magical powers because Camelot has outlawed all magic on threat of death. He spends his time secretly protecting Arthur and Camelot in hopes that Arthur will someday grow into a great King.
This review is for season (or series) 3 and 4 of Merlin. If you have not seen season 1 and 2 I encouraged you to check out our season 1-2 review or simply go watch the show. This episode does not even attempt to describe the premise of Merlin and completely spoils all of season three and four. So beware! This is no holds barred magical Arthurian spoiler time!
This television series just keeps getting better! The show makes a steady incline in quality throughout season three until its a really great show in season four. Does that make up for some of the lack luster episodes in season one? Yes, actually. I think it does. Many aspects of Arthur&rsquo;s character development are finally barring fruit in season four that had seeds planted way back in season one. Merlin himself still has lots of room to grow, but he&rsquo;s shown some welcome steps into becoming more pro-active instead of reactive (and ignoring Gaius&rsquo;s terrible advice). Hopefully, in season five we&rsquo;ll finally see him become the warlock of legend.
The series does have some problems, mostly involving Morganna&rsquo;s strange character development. In season three, they take some dramatic shortcuts in her development. While its certainly plausible, the show doesn&rsquo;t bother explaining or even showing the path it took her to reach her new persona. Furthermore, she doesn&rsquo;t appear to have any remnants of her old persona at all. There&rsquo;s some weird slippery slope fallacies going on there and odd inconsistencies. I wonder if this was because the writers were so determined to follow the path of the actual Arthurian legends? Who knows, but she&rsquo;s definitely the weakest link in season three and four.
We highly recommend you check out this series. Make sure to start from the beginning though! If you watched season one and two and are on the fence about watching more, we think you should reconsider. The series gets continually better and really rewards long time listeners.]]></description>

			<title>Anime Talk Special</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/special-anime-talk]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
This episode was original recorded in 2009 as two separate episodes.&nbsp; When the podcast changed from The Power of Friendship Podcast to The Fantasy Movie Podcast a couple of years ago I took several episodes out.&nbsp; They were taken out because I thought it was weird that The Fantasy Movie Podcast had several episodes in a row that had nothing to do with fantasy movies.&nbsp; I had always intended to sporadic rerelease them, but for some reason I forgot all about them!&nbsp; So here two of them are.&nbsp; They're edited together due to their short lengths and similar topics.
&nbsp;
Part I -&nbsp; Shojo Anime -&nbsp; Melanie and Kasey discuss their overall opinion on shojo manga.&nbsp; It isn't particularly positive.&nbsp; Shojo manga is full of wimpy crying heroines and often is disturbingly sexist.&nbsp; Most disturbingly is the unhealthy relationships they often support.&nbsp; The jerk often gets the girl even if he's roughed her up a bit or threatened her life.
&nbsp;
They also are almost always solely focused on romance. Shonen titles can have romance too, but they also come in variety of genres.&nbsp; Romance can be a subplot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Shojo manga usually doesn't get the luxury.
&nbsp;
Kasey doesn't hate all romance by the way, despite what this episode may lead you to believe.
&nbsp;
Not all shojo manga and anime sucks though.&nbsp; Kasey highly recommends Basara and Melanie likes the yaoi comic Yami no Matsui.&nbsp; They both agree that the Josei titles Nodame Cantabile and Tramps like Us are great.
&nbsp;
Re-editing this episode made me a little sad.&nbsp; In one part you can hear my long dead dog in the background...
&nbsp;
Part II - Anime Expiration Date -&nbsp; Is there an age expiration date for anime fandom? Do most fans drop out of anime fandom in their late twenties and early thirties?&nbsp; Or do they just stop talking on the internet about it?
&nbsp;
We know for sure there is less and less anime made that we actually enjoy and want to watch.&nbsp; Is that our age showing or are they just not making shows that appeal to a wider audience anymore?
&nbsp;
What about you?&nbsp; Do you think an anime fan expiration date exists?&nbsp; ]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thepoweroffriendship/FMP-037-Tinman.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Tinman is a 2007 Syfy Miniseries directed by Nick Willing.&nbsp; It is loosley based on L. Frank Baum&rsquo;s Oz book series.&nbsp; Very loosely.
The miniseries has great production values, intriguing writing, and most of the cast are talented.&nbsp; Zooey Deschanel gives an odd almost autistic portrayal of the main character D.J.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure if she was directed that way or if it&rsquo;s just Zooey Deschanel being Zooey Deschanel.&nbsp; The rest of the cast is fantastic, particularly Neal McDonough and Kathleen Robertson.
The world building rivals a Hollywood film.&nbsp; Everything in the world, from the steampunk technology to the rare glimpse of magic fits well into the world.&nbsp;The technology, politics, history, etc of the O.Z. is well thought out and has its own internal logic.&nbsp; The world feels like it could really work.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Tinman is a 2007 Syfy Miniseries directed by Nick Willing.&nbsp; It is loosley based on L. Frank Baum&rsquo;s Oz book series.&nbsp; Very loosely.
The miniseries has great production values, intriguing writing, and most of the cast are talented.&nbsp; Zooey Deschanel gives an odd almost autistic portrayal of the main character D.J.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure if she was directed that way or if it&rsquo;s just Zooey Deschanel being Zooey Deschanel.&nbsp; The rest of the cast is fantastic, particularly Neal McDonough and Kathleen Robertson.
The world building rivals a Hollywood film.&nbsp; Everything in the world, from the steampunk technology to the rare glimpse of magic fits well into the world.&nbsp;The technology, politics, history, etc of the O.Z. is well thought out and has its own internal logic.&nbsp; The world feels like it could really work.

            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/sleepy-hollow]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[So here&rsquo;s a podcast about Tim Burton&rsquo;s 1999 version of Sleepy Hollow starring Johnny Depp and Christinia Ricci&hellip; only a month after Halloween is over! That&rsquo;s nearly on time! Right? Right? Well, it was recorded on Oct 30th at least.
Tim Burton&rsquo;s version of Sleepy Hollow is vastly different from the original short story but for the better. It has a great cast, special effects that hold up pretty well, and some top notch spooky atmosphere. Is it great? Not really, there are several plot holes, shortcuts taken with characterization, and Johnny Depp and Christinia Ricci don&rsquo;t have fantastic chemistry together. It&rsquo;s still a solid film though, that&rsquo;s enjoyable to watch every few years on Halloween.
This fills a request from Monica G. I hope you enjoyed the episode.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://fantasymoviepodcast.com/the-addams-family/]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[They&rsquo;re creepy, they&rsquo;re cooky, they&rsquo;re altogether ooky they&rsquo;re The Addams Family!
This was meant to come out in October, but since it took me so long to make the website you&rsquo;re getting it now.&nbsp; The Addams Family is about family though and Thanksgiving is about family (well in the U.S. at least) so that sort of fits right? Maybe?
The Addams Family is a 1991 film directed&nbsp; by Barry Sonnenfeld that&rsquo;s loosely based on the 1960s television series and on Charles Addams Original comics.&nbsp; The Addams Family is a group of macabre, gothic, and possibly nigh invulnerable family who enjoy such wholesome pastimes as sword fighting, knife throwing, torturing their siblings, keeping lions as pets, and reveling in the forces of darkness.&nbsp; In this adaption, Uncle Fester shows up on their doorstep with amnesia after having disappeared for decades.&nbsp; Only, he thinks he&rsquo;s not Uncle Fester but a guy named Gordon whose going to con them out of their fortune.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s kind of like the plot of Anastasia only you know, evil.
The Addams Family holds up really well to this day and the whole franchise in general is still awesome as far as we&rsquo;re concerned.&nbsp; You can watch several episodes legally on youtube here. The original series is also all available on Netflix as of this recording.&nbsp; The movies themselves (The Addams Family and its sequel The Addams Family Values) can be easily obtained usually in a fairly cheap combo pack.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thepoweroffriendship/FMP-034-Legend.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[
Legend is a 1986 fantasy film directed by Ridley Scott of Blade Runner and Alien fame. It stars Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, and Tim Curry. The plot of the movie is that there's an evil red demon dude who wants to destroy all goodness and light in the world because he's evil and that's what evil dudes do. He gets his chance when a young girl taints a unicorn by touching it, allowing darkness and his minions to kill one of the unicorns and plunge the world into eternal winter. 
I'm surprised we haven't done this movie yet. Its one of the quintessential eighties fantasy films alongside Black Crystal, Labyrinth, and the Neverending Story.&nbsp; It's a film that holds up pretty well as long as you watch the director's cut.&nbsp; &nbsp;Unlike most director's cuts, the theatrical version and the director's cut of legend are drastically different.&nbsp; The latter even makes sense! If you've never seen this movie definitely check it out and if you've only ever seen the theatrical version, you should try the vastly improved director's cut.

Next Episode:&nbsp; The Addams Family.&nbsp; It's even recorded I just have to edit it.

            <description><![CDATA[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a film adaption of an Alan Moore comic about classic book characters who team up to save the world.&nbsp; It stars Sean Connery as Allan Quatermain (a book character that no one but Alan Moore remembered) and some other people play a vampire, invisible man, Captain Nemo, Dorian Gray, Tom Sawyer, and Dr Jekyll/Hyde.
This is a&nbsp;fun but rather shallow action movie.&nbsp;It was a request from regular listener Charlie.&nbsp;&nbsp;On reflection,&nbsp;he might have been referring to the comics but he needs to differentiate better next time.&nbsp; Although we're lazy so we might not have read the comics.&nbsp; Still, we don't regret watching this movie and its a fun romp the first time through.&nbsp; Its worth watching at least once if you can see it on television or borrow it from a friend, but don't pay any extra money for it.
This was recorded several weeks ago, so if you left feedback since then for the Tangled episode it hasn't been ignored.&nbsp; Your feedback will be read and discussed during the next episode.

			<title>Stardust</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/stardust]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Stardust is a 2007 fantasy film directed by Mathew Vaughn based on the book by Neil Gaiman.&nbsp; It has a pretty star studded cast (ha ha ) of Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, Robert Deniro, and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Plot:&nbsp; An awkward young man named Tristan Thorn crosses a wall into a fantasy realm in order to retrieve a falling star for his beloved Victoria.&nbsp; Only when he gets there, the fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine.&nbsp; And unfortunately, he's not the only one trying to retrieve the fallen star.
This episode came out okay.&nbsp; I tried to edit out more of the pauses then I was previously taking out as Podcast Squared suggested.&nbsp; Can anyone tell a difference?&nbsp; I didn't want it to be super snappy, because I wanted to preserve the feeling of just listening to regular people talk about movies.&nbsp; I think it's possible to become too polished and come off sounding fake and generic.
Stardust is a mixed bag.&nbsp; It has some great visuals, fun character moments,&nbsp;and a stellar cast.&nbsp; But it also has some major plot problems, and the main couple are anything but star crossed.&nbsp; However, overall it's a fun movie that's worth watching at least once.

			<title>Fantasy Moive Podicast Reviewed on Podcast Squared</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/fantasy-moive-podicast-reviewed-on-podcast-squared]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[I submitted the podcast to be reviewed by Podcast Squared&nbsp;which is a podcast that reviews other podcasts.&nbsp; And they actually reviewed us!
Check it out here: http://podcastsquared.com/2011/07/12/podcast-squared-56-more-real-than-real/

I have to agree with everything the podcast said especially the criticism about pauses being too long.&nbsp; We record in two seperate&nbsp;files through skype and when I put them back together I struggle with the editing. Since we don't see each other, I have to edit out the many times we talk over&nbsp;one another.&nbsp; When I add pauses I have trouble finding what length sounds 'natural' in the added pauses. I'm not sure how to fix that, other than to keep practicing I guess.

			<title>Sanctuary  Season 1-2</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/sanctuary-1]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Sanctuary is a 2008 - Present fantasy television series starring Amanda Tapping.&nbsp; The series revolves around Helen Magnus, a 150 year old immortal who has dedicated her life to protecting unusual people and creatures.&nbsp; She does this through her Sanctuary network: a global private task force that investigates, protects, and if necessary contains beings/creatures called abnormals.&nbsp; The series is currently running on the Syfy channel and has recently completed its thrid season.&nbsp; A fourth season is schedules to air next fall.
This series is fantastic and vastly underrated.&nbsp; The story is excellent, the special effects are quite good (and not just for a tv series) and the casting is inspired.&nbsp; How often do you get to see a badass main character who is a woman, a scientist, a mother, and a badass who is actually older than thirty? Not very damn often, that's for sure.
I know this episode is way too long.&nbsp; I was going to break it up into two episodes, but I'm tired of editing and just want to get it out.&nbsp; Hopefully, someone will still be interested.
What do you think of Sanctuary?&nbsp; Love it? Hate it?&nbsp; Have you even heard of it?&nbsp; Leave a comment!

			<title>Merlin Season 1-2</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/merlin]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Merlin also known as The Adventures of Merlin is a British BBC One TV show that started in 2008. &nbsp;It was created by Julian Jones, Jake Michie, Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps. &nbsp;As of this recording in May 2011 it has three television seasons with another slated for next autumn. &nbsp;The series was created to be a family drama that children to grandparents could enjoy together.
&nbsp;
PLOT: Camelot has outlawed magic. &nbsp;Anyone seen practicing magic or helping someone practicing magic will be put to death by order of the king. &nbsp;No exceptions. &nbsp;Magical creatures are killed on sight, whether they are dangerous or not. &nbsp;The king even killed every dragon in the land save one, which he imprisoned below the castle to serve as an example to anyone who dares to defy the King.
&nbsp;
Merlin is sent to Camelot by his mother to stay with the Camelot royal physician named Gaius. &nbsp;Through a series of fortunate (or unfortunate depending on who you ask) he comes to be the manservant of Prince Arthur. &nbsp;Now, he must use his powers in secret to help Prince Arthur become a great king someday, knowing that if he is ever found out to be magical he would be put to death.
&nbsp;
OH My God.&nbsp; We must never talk this long again.&nbsp; It took me 7 hours to edit this episode.&nbsp; This episode covers only season 1-2 of Merlin.&nbsp; There are no spoilers for season 3 and onward.&nbsp; We might go back later and do another episode that covers season 3.&nbsp; This series has some problems, but I think its a fun ride and worth the effort of tracking down if you're a fantasy fan.&nbsp; The first two episodes are a little rough, but the show continuously improves as it goes on.
&nbsp;

I, the amazing Kasey (that should be my new title), made a guest appearance on The Midnight Movie Club.&nbsp; My guest appearance is on their special segment &ldquo;Three of the Best&rdquo;.&nbsp; I did three of the best dorky fantasy movies.&nbsp; I originally did three of the best Studio Ghibli movies, but there were technical difficulties in that one.&nbsp; So I made up another one on the fly (because I&rsquo;m amazing).&nbsp; It starts at 51:18 on the recording, but I recommend listening to the whole thing.&nbsp; The two hosts have great repartee with each other and their selection of nostalgic movies are pretty closely aligned with many of the shows we review here.
&nbsp;
I was kind of nervous (it was my first time guest starring) but I think it came out alright!

			<title>Coraline</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/corraline]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This week we're discussing the 2009 stop motion movie Coraline.&nbsp; The movie was directed by Henry Selick, the same amazing man that brought us The Nightmare Before Christmas. The original novel the movie is based on is by Neil Gaiman who is also awesome.&nbsp; So it stands to reason that this episode is chocked full of awesome.
&nbsp;
Plot Synopsis:&nbsp; Coraline is a brave and inquisitive 11 year old that has moved from Michigan with her family to a run down apartment complex in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; While exploring her new home she comes across a door that takes her to a magical land where everything is better.&nbsp; The house is better, the food is better, even her parents are better.&nbsp; She has everything she&rsquo;s ever wished for.&nbsp; But this fantasy world isn&rsquo;t as wonderful as it first seems&hellip;&nbsp; And why does her other mother have buttons for eyes?
&nbsp;
Is this the newest movie we've ever done? Maybe? Anyways, Coraline is a great movie.&nbsp; It can be a little creepy though, so if you have kids you might want to watch it before hand.&nbsp; Its got an old school eighties kid movie mentality that's quite a bit scarier than kids movies of the past twenties years.&nbsp; I think this episode turned out alright.&nbsp; We used an outline.&nbsp; Go us.
&nbsp;
What did you think of the movie o'listeners/readers?

            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/dragon-age-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[This is a special episode where we review not a fantasy movie, but a fantasy game.&nbsp; Dragon Age: Origins is a 2009 western role playing game from Bioware for the PC, Xbox 360, and ps3.&nbsp; In this game you choose one of six different origins, choose between three classes, pick your gender, and create the look of your character.&nbsp; The storyline isn't anything too unusual.&nbsp; You're a special warrior that is called upon to save the land from darkness, but the game really shines in the writing.&nbsp; The world is detailed and well realized.&nbsp; Characters feel like real people.&nbsp; Your choices mold how the story progresses and ends so you feel emersed in this world like few others.
We were intending to have this game only cover Dragon Age: Origins, but Dragon Age 2 (the sequel) had recently came out and bits of it kept slipping into the podcast.&nbsp; We were both only in Act I of Dragon Age 2 when we recorded this so there aren't any Dragon Age: 2&nbsp;storyline spoilers.&nbsp; However, we do speak at length about the game mechanics and how they compare to the previous game.&nbsp; We also talk at length on video game rpgs in general.&nbsp;
And we complain.&nbsp; A lot.]]></description>

			<title>The 10th Kingdom</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/the-10th-kingdom]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[The 10th Kingdom is an American fantasy television miniseries that was first released in 2000.&nbsp; The story stars a young twenty something waitress named&nbsp;Virginia Louis who lives at the edge of Central Park.&nbsp; One day she accidently runs into a dog while riding her bike to work.&nbsp; But its no ordinary dog.&nbsp; Its in fact, a prince from a fantasy kingdom whose been turned into a dog by an evil step mother.&nbsp; This drags Virginia and her disaster prone father into an epic fantasy adventure full of trolls, magic, sheep (?), witches, dwarves, fairies, true love,&nbsp;and one very confused but very sexy half wolfman.
This episode does NOT contain spoilers (or has very little spoilers).&nbsp; Unlike many works we discuss, the 10th Kingdom is underrated, undervalued and underwatched.&nbsp; In discussing this show, we hope to simply let more people know of its existence.&nbsp; It's a fantastic show that not many people have heard of and not very many people watched when it first aired.&nbsp; Buy this show or rent it from Netflix if you live in the U.S.&nbsp; You won't be disapointed.

            <description><![CDATA[So we tried to record and upload our Groundhog Day episode on actual Groundhog Day, but well... epic fail on our part.&nbsp; At least, we made it to the same month.
Movie Synopsis:&nbsp; Bill Murray plays a cynical weatherman named Phil&nbsp;who is tasked with covering the Groundhog Day festival in Punxatawney PA.&nbsp; Everything seems normal at first.&nbsp;He covers the festival and has to stay in the town for an extra day due to a freak snow storm.&nbsp; However, he wakes up the next day and its... Groundhog Day again.&nbsp;He goes to sleep the next night and its... groundhog day again.&nbsp; The day is repeating itself over and over and over and only Phil can tell.
This is Bill Murray's best role, in my opinion.&nbsp; He gives some depth and character to&nbsp;a role that much have been quite challenging due to the flow of time in the movie (movies are usually filmed out of order).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a classic that everyone should see&nbsp;more than once.&nbsp; It&nbsp;ironically stands up to multiple viewings quite well.&nbsp; If you haven't seen this, shame on you! Seriously, where have you been? Not knowing about this movie means you have a hole in your soul and you never even realized it!

            <description><![CDATA[Red Sonja is an eighties fantasy movie about a red haired chick killing evil people with swords while getting hit on by the govenator.&nbsp; Pretty sweet right?&nbsp; In all honesty, this movie is terrible.&nbsp; The dialogue is stilted, the acting is amateurish, and the special effects weren't that impressive in 1985.&nbsp; But for some reason, I love this cheesy movie to bits.&nbsp; It's got a lot of heart, and despite its many flaws its a fun ride.&nbsp;
Just a quick warning:&nbsp; If you're planning on watching this movie with kids around, there is a random female&nbsp;topless scene.&nbsp; It's weirdly random even for a topless scene.&nbsp; However, the edited for tv version is just fine for kids to watch.&nbsp; I watched it all the time as a kid and I am mostly a non warped human being.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/episode-23-the-nightmare-before-christmas]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[I did it! Somehow, barely, I got the Nightmare Before Christmas episode out before Christmas.&nbsp; It's a holiday miracle!
The Nightmare Before Christmas is a stop motion animated feature directed by Henry Selick with music by Danny Elfman.&nbsp; Tim Burton wrote the original three page narrative poem the story is based on, and also created the character designs for the main characters.
The story is pretty simple and straight-forward.&nbsp; Jack is the Pumpkin King and the leader of Halloween town.&nbsp; Halloween town is a mystical realm that's dedicated to running Halloween across the mortal world.&nbsp; One day after Halloween, Jack starts to get emo and decides he needs a change.&nbsp; He accidently wanders into Christmas town and decides that he'd like to try&nbsp;Christmas out instead.&nbsp; Problem is, he and the rest of the people of Halloween town can't quite mentally grasp a holiday that's about good will and cheer...&nbsp; Also he has to kidnap Santa Claus.&nbsp; For his own good.
Melanie's side of the audio sounds pretty horrible.&nbsp; Her new laptop defaulted back to the built in microphone instead&nbsp; of the good standalone one we usually use.&nbsp;&nbsp;We had no idea the&nbsp;quality had been borked until I started to edit it and then it was either put out borked&nbsp;sound or miss the Christmas deadline.&nbsp; Hopefully it's still entertaining.&nbsp;]]></description>

			<title>Escaflowne</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/episode-22-escaflowne]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&nbsp;
We hadn't done an anime in a long time, and it was apparently for good reason.&nbsp; It took us forever to watch this! 
Escaflowne is an odd mish-match of shojo and shonen elements with genres like fantasy, mechas, and romance all thrown into one big bowl and mixed around to varying degrees of success.&nbsp; The story follows a typical Japanese high school girl named Hitomi Kanzaki.&nbsp; Hitomi is fond giving tarot card readings and running track.&nbsp; One day a mysterious boy with a sword shows up, and she's suddenly transported to the fantasy world of Gaia.&nbsp; There her tarot card readings becoming very accurate and she&rsquo;s thrust into an epic war.
We remembered this show being better, for some reason. It's not terrible by any stretch of the imagination, but it certainty didn't hold up to scrutiny ten years after our original viewing.

			<title>Corpse Bride</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thepoweroffriendship.libsyn.com/episode-21-the-corpse-bride]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&nbsp;This episode was way easy to edit.&nbsp; I think Melanie and I leveled up our talking skills.&nbsp;
The Corpse Bride is a 2005 film directed by Tim Burton and Mike Johnson.&nbsp; The film is set in Victorian era England where the son of a rich fish monger, Victor, is to be engaged to the daughter of an 'old money' couple named Victoria.&nbsp; The match is a business arrangment.&nbsp; Love isn't even a factor.&nbsp; However, when the two young people&nbsp;meet they hit it off right away.&nbsp; Unfortunatly, Victor is so nervous he screws up the wedding reception and after a stroke of bad luck, accidently marries a dead&nbsp;woman named Emily.
This is a great stop motion film that's surprisingly touching and romantic despite its horror appearance.&nbsp; The Corpse Bride seems like she'd be a horror from the underworld who rises from the dead to exact revenge upon the living, but she's actually a sweet tragic heroine who you really feel for even if she's scary looking.&nbsp;
We tried to do a little more research for this review than normal, and hopefully it shows.
&nbsp;

Next Episode:&nbsp; An indepth discussion on the classic anime Escaflowne.&nbsp; Because men with wings are awesome.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Today's episode was requested by Monica G who wanted 'something by Tim Burton'.&nbsp; So not only are we giving you today's episode Beetlejuice, we're giving you The Corpse Bride as the next episode! A whole month of Tim Burton!&nbsp;
Beetlejuice is a 1988 comedy/horror film by the infamous Tim Burton.&nbsp; It tells the story of a young married couple who die and&nbsp;are stuck haunting their former home.&nbsp; Yuppies buy their house, the ghost couple want them out, and wackyness ensues! There's also a creepy and disgusting&nbsp;pedophile Micheal Keaton who wants to marry a super emo teenaged Winoa Ryder.
This is one of our shorter episodes, but eh, sometimes you don't know if a movie will make a great podcast until you try.&nbsp;

            <description><![CDATA[Talking about the film The Princess Bride is hard.
It's not that it's a particularly deep film with all of this hidden subtext.&nbsp; In fact, it's a pretty straight forward film of swash buckeling adventure where true love conquers all and the heroes ride off into the sunset at the end. This film isn't good because it's wrapped in a crunchy shell of childhood nostalgia.&nbsp; It's actually good.&nbsp; And when films are&nbsp;actually good, they're very very hard to make fun of.
And here at the Fantasy Movie Podcast we're all about making fun of things.
That's the main reason why we put off podcasting about this movie.&nbsp; We tried to make a go of it this episode, and I'm not sure how well we pulled it off.&nbsp; How do you think we did listeners?
Thanks for requesting this film Sylvia!
If you want to request what fantasy movie we discuss, complain how we didn't do this film justice, ask us to forward money to Nigeria, or make a general comment about the podcast, please send us an email or comment below!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Episode&nbsp;18 is here and it's infused with UNICORN POWER! We're reviewing the 1982 animated classic The Last Unicorn. This film was produced by Rankin/Bass for and animated by Topcraft who would later become Studio Ghibli.&nbsp; The film is beautiful to look at and really shows its pedigree, especially in the hand painted backgrounds.&nbsp; There are some really beautiful pastoral scenes in this film.
The Last Unicorn is the story&nbsp;of a unicorn who one day finds out that she may be the last unicorn in the world.&nbsp; She goes on a quest to discover if this is true and if it is, to free the rest of the unicorns.&nbsp; It's a fairly simple setup but the characters are very well developed and bring a depth to this animated film that isn't often seen in english produced productions.

            <description><![CDATA[This is the&nbsp;Indie Comics Special broadcasting straight into your brain like a laser beam of the future (sort of).&nbsp; Indie comics are comics from independent publishers, although the term is commonly used to refer to comics that aren't D.C or Marvel comics.&nbsp; These comics tend toward non-superhero themes and cover just as wide an array of genres, topics, and themes as manga.&nbsp; I never understood why indie comics aren't well known with manga fans.&nbsp; Are they just stuck on the stigma that all american comics are superheroes?
Unlike most episodes, this one does NOT have spoilers.&nbsp; Since indie comics aren't as well known as they should be, we decided to do three recommendations instead of our usual analysis.
Series we recommend on this episode are:

Scott Pilgrim 
Polly and the Pirates

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thepoweroffriendship/FMP-016-HowlsMovingCastle.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[&nbsp;
This episode we&nbsp;discuss the Ghibli film Howl's Moving Castle AND the book Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones.&nbsp; We had two requests from Tora-chan and Monica G for the Miyazaki directed Howl's Moving Castle, but decided to also include the book in our discussion.&nbsp; I read the book long before I saw the movie, and its far far superior to the lackluster Ghibli film.&nbsp; Sophie is a much more fiery and proactive heroine in the book.&nbsp; She was very much Howl's equal.&nbsp; Furthermore, most of the narrative problems with the movie stem from the nonsensical add ons that Ghibli stacked on that were not prescent in Diana Wynne's book.&nbsp; There was nothing about the enviroment in the original book, and the war was something that was only&nbsp;mentioned briefly.
This episode is a little short.&nbsp; Melanie's connection was going out so we had to end the discussion about 10-15 minutes early.&nbsp; The episode is still a half an hour long, though.
So what was your opinion on Ghibli's Howl's Moving Castle? How do you think it holds up to the book? Were you even aware there was a book?&nbsp; Got requests?&nbsp; Please comment, we love to hear your thoughts and opinions!

This episode we&nbsp;discuss the Ghibli film Howl's Moving Castle AND the book Howl's Moving Castle by Diana Wynne Jones.&nbsp; We had two requests from Tora-chan and Monica G for the Miyazaki directed Howl's Moving Castle, but decided to also include the book in our discussion.&nbsp; I read the book long before I saw the movie, and its far far superior to the lackluster Ghibli film.&nbsp; Sophie is a much more fiery and proactive heroine in the book.&nbsp; She was very much Howl's equal.&nbsp; Furthermore, most of the narrative problems with the movie stem from the nonsensical add ons that Ghibli stacked on that were not prescent in Diana Wynne's book.&nbsp; There was nothing about the enviroment in the original book, and the war was something that was only&nbsp;mentioned briefly.
This episode is a little short.&nbsp; Melanie's connection was going out so we had to end the discussion about 10-15 minutes early.&nbsp; The episode is still a half an hour long, though.
So what was your opinion on Ghibli's Howl's Moving Castle? How do you think it holds up to the book? Were you even aware there was a book?&nbsp; Got requests?&nbsp; Please comment, we love to hear your thoughts and opinions!

            <description><![CDATA[We're kicking it old school today by discussing the 90s anime Ranma 1/2.
Ranma 1/2 is a martial arts comedy about marital artists who fell into magical springs that turn them into different things when cold water hits them.&nbsp; For instance, the main character Ranma fell into the spring of drowned girl and now turns into a girl when hit with cold water.&nbsp; So we get things like high flying martial arts fights between a red haired girl, a blind duck, and one badass little piggy... all in the name of love.
I'm not sure why we used to like Ranma 1/2 so much.&nbsp; It's a fun enough series, but it's really repetitive and the animation quality has not aged well at all.&nbsp; Heck, we even used to wrote fanfics (Kasey's and Melanie's) for some unknown reason.

            <description><![CDATA[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya and The Sighs of Haruhi Suzumiya are two seasons of anime about a japanese highschool girl named Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi yearns to be special and stand out amongst the crowd.&nbsp; On the first day of school, she declares that she's not interested in normal humans and asks that any time travelers, espers, and aliens come see her so that they can hang out.If you haven't figured it out already, Haruhi is a weirdo.Unbeknowst to her, Haruhi's highschool already has time travelers, espers, and aliens.&nbsp; And not only that, but she may be more special then all of them combined.In fact, Haruhi may be God.I hope everyone hasn't left us after the long hiatus.&nbsp; I made this episode nice and long to make up for it.&nbsp; It's full of enthusiasm, maybe too much.&nbsp; I got rather excited talking about this topic and often times drowned out Melanie.&nbsp; My bad.&nbsp; There shouldn't be any more long delays.&nbsp; I have several episodes already recorded including a request for Howl's Moving Castle, and a Ranma 1/2 episode.]]></description>

Cowabunga dudes and dudettes!
&nbsp;
To make up for the missed week last month, I&rsquo;m releasing this episode a week early.&nbsp; The next episode will come two weeks from this one.
&nbsp;
Prepare yourself for a ninja explosion of epic proportions as we review the 1990 live action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie!
&nbsp;
Actually, I feel like we short changed this movie.&nbsp; Prior to recording, I felt like we could wring a lot more discussion out of it.&nbsp; Oddly enough, for a movie with guys in rubber turtle costumes doing martial arts, it&rsquo;s surprisingly straight forward.&nbsp; The plot more or less boils down to &ndash; bad ninjas show up and bring down Americas youth, good turtle ninjas come and stop them, and pizza is awesome.
&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s still a really enjoyable movie though, and has held up quite well over the years.&nbsp; Many of the jokes are still funny, the practical special effects have aged well, and the choreography is top notch.
&nbsp;
In this episode, we also learn a new and interesting way to use a blow-dryer.
&nbsp;
If you have a movie or anime you&rsquo;d like to see us review, drop us a line by commenting on this blog, or by emailing us at thepoweroffriendshippodcast@yahoo.com. &nbsp;You have a VERY good chance of having your favorite anime or movie reviewed!&nbsp;&nbsp;

I apologize for the podcast being released a week late.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t have an excuse beyond me being confused about what week it was&hellip; oops.&nbsp; I'm going to attempt to release another episode next week to make up for the lost time.&nbsp; We have several recorded, it's simply a matter of me editing the darn things.
&nbsp;
This&nbsp;episode is a&nbsp;special request from listeners Monica G and Tora-chan.&nbsp; We review the 1982 fantasy movie The Dark Crystal.&nbsp; The Dark Crystal is an all puppet movie directed by Jim Henson and Frank Oz.&nbsp; Although this is a typical nostalgia geek movie, neither Melanie nor I had seen this movie prior to reviewing it.
&nbsp;
The plot goes like this &hellip; Two good puppets who are the last of their puppet race must set forth on a perilous journey to defeat other evil and less pretty puppets and restore peace to their world.
&nbsp;
Melanie also makes me admit that if&nbsp;Bill Murray and I&nbsp;were the last humans on earth I would utilize him in repopulating the earth&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; thanks a lot for asking that Mel.
&nbsp;
If you have a request for an anime or movie you'd like to hear us review, please send us an email or leave a comment&nbsp;on this&nbsp;post!

            <description><![CDATA[By special request from Emmy Kay, this week we're reviewing the 1984 fantasy film The Neverending Story.
The Neverending Story is about a young boy named Sabastian who steals finds a fantasy book called the Neverending Story.&nbsp; The book majorily breaks the fourth wall and starts to talk to him as if its real.&nbsp; Which means that you are listening to a podcast about a movie about a kid who doesn't know he's in a movie&nbsp;who reads a book about another kid who doesn't know he's in a book.
But whose listening to YOU dear listener?
DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN.
There's no little intro skit this week, because Melanie is gone and not answering my emails. I think it's safe to assume she's joined a technophobic cult that believes in&nbsp;becoming&nbsp;one with&nbsp;the land and venerating the radish.&nbsp; I had heard her say many times "To eat radishes is to be close to god".&nbsp; Little did I know how far reaching her beliefs were.&nbsp; She shall be missed.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thepoweroffriendship/PoF-13-SlayersNext.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Slayers Next is the second season of Slayers, and by far the best. The series improves greatly from Slayers.&nbsp; The animation quality increases, the humor hits home more often, and the plot can be quite powerful at times.
In this episode, we get into the nitty gritty of the plot of Slayers Next and also some of Slayers Try. As of this recording, however, we had not yet watched Slayers Revolution and Slayers Evolution-R so you don't have to worry about being spoiled on those.
If you haven't seen the show and are interested, the series is really easy to obtain. Deep Discount has the first three series (Slayers, Slayers Next, and Slayers Try) for less than $50 dollars. You can also watch all three seasons of Slayers legally for free on Funimation's official website&nbsp;&nbsp;and on some of the&nbsp;episodes are also up on&nbsp;Funimation's youtube page.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Willow is a 1988 fantasy film directed by Ron Howard and starring Warwick Davis.&nbsp; Willow is a young farmer who goes on a quest to save a baby's life from an evil queen who belives the child is destined to overthrow her.&nbsp; Along the way, he makes friends with a quirky cast of characters and finds the inner strength to become a hero.
What can be said about Willow? It's a cult classic that's been on our 'to do' list since first deciding to do a podcast.&nbsp; The film holds up very well and is still a joy to watch with adult eyes.&nbsp; If you've never seen this film, by all means look it up.&nbsp; It's readily available and is even on Netflix's Instant Watch service.
We were both rather sick when we recorded this episode, but we only sound slighty froggish.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thepoweroffriendship/PoF-011-Slayers.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[In this episode, we finally review Slayers! This nineties fantasy anime series is near and dear to me and Melanie&rsquo;s hearts.&nbsp; It was the anime series that made me an anime nerd and holds up quite well to this day. It&rsquo;s still my favorite anime series.
&nbsp;
Slayers is the humorous fantasy tale of Lina Inverse badass sorceress supreme who steals from bandits and gives to herself. Her love of money is only equal to her love of food.&nbsp; Steal Lina Inverse&rsquo;s ham sandwich and you&rsquo;ll quickly wish you&rsquo;d never been born. &nbsp;Also, don&rsquo;t mention she&rsquo;s short, flat-chested, and has a bad temper&hellip; Really it&rsquo;d would be best to avoid her at all costs.&nbsp; Maybe take a vacation to another city if she&rsquo;s headed your way? 
&nbsp;
Lina is joined by a crew of quirky sidekicks all of which are pretty darn interesting in of themselves.&nbsp; Through various circumstances the Slayers often have to save the world from total annihilation (mostly because they'd be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the world when the annihilation would happen). 
&nbsp;
Slayers is the first season of this totally awesome anime series which is followed by Slayers Next, Slayers Try, Slayers Revolution, and Slayers Evolution-R.&nbsp; There are also some O.V.A&rsquo;s where Lina runs around with different characters from the series, but I don&rsquo;t recommend them.
&nbsp;
Definitely check this series out if you haven&rsquo;t seen it already! &nbsp;The first three seasons are dirt cheap on Deep Discount.&nbsp; Look forward to our reviews of the rest of the Slayers seasons on later podcasts!
&nbsp;
Next Episode: 
We review the classic fantasy flick, Willow.]]></description>

            <link><![CDATA[http://traffic.libsyn.com/thepoweroffriendship/FMP-007-SkulduggeryPleasant.mp3]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Skulduggery Pleasant is a Young Adult Fantasy series by Derek Landy that so far consists of the books, The Sceptor of the Ancients, Playing with Fire, and The Faceless Ones.&nbsp; The premise is that a twelve year old girl&nbsp;named Stephanie Edgely is saved one day by a talking skeleton detective. That day she discovers that magic is in fact real.&nbsp; However, unlike most people upon having their world view turned upside down her reponse isn't 'Waaaah I want my life to be normal again!'&nbsp;
No, her response is, 'CAN YOU TEACH ME TO&nbsp;THROW FIREBALLS WITH MY MIND?!'&nbsp;
Well, that's her response after she passes out.&nbsp; No one's perfect.
Skulduggery Pleasant is one of the best book series I have ever read. I sincerely hope that it's able to one day rise to Harry Potter level of fame.&nbsp; It more than deserves it, and is a beacon of light to anyone who yearns to read about a heroine who kicks&nbsp;butt and doesn't appear to have an emo bone in her body.
This episode is meant for those who already know and love the series. We discuss and analyze the plot of the first three books and theorize on the plot of future books.&nbsp; So please, come back to this episode after you have read the books.&nbsp; Otherwise, you'll be cheating yourself out of one amazing ride.
If you haven't read the books already, you must check them out!]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Melanie made me watch a furry movie.
The Secret of NIMH is a 1982 movie directed by Don Bluth.&nbsp; The premise is that a widowed mother must find a way to stop the plow from destorying her house in order to save her very ill son.&nbsp; There are also several rodents with psychic powers.&nbsp; It was the 80s, go figure.
We tried recording in the same room poor people style (with one microphone). It sounds like we're recording from within the core of the earth. Oh well, we won't try that again. I tried to enchance this episode in the post-editing process by inserting smartass comments throughout.&nbsp; I'm not sure how that turned out.&nbsp; Any comments pertaining to my success or epic fail&nbsp;would be greatly apprettiated.]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[Hook! Hook! Where is the Hook?!
Arrrrgh mateys! Ye be listening to our review of the 1991 fantasy movie Hook!&nbsp; In this movie there be the scallywags Robin Williams as Peter Panning and that scurvy dog Dustin Hoffman as Captain Hook. Swab the poop deck and be ready to eat a parrot! Arrrrrgh!
Ok, enough of that. 
Hook is the story of a grown up Peter Pan who has forgotten everything about Neverland.&nbsp; One day Captain Hook shows up and kidnaps his kids and he must regain his former glory to save them.
The movie was directed by Steven Spielburg and seems to get ragged on a lot by the internet.&nbsp; But you won&rsquo;t see that from here!&nbsp; We both have rather fond memories of the movie and Roofio&rsquo;s mysteriously dyed hair.
In fact, if I ever meet Dante Bosco in real life, I vow to say, &ldquo;Roofio you&rsquo;re alive!&rdquo;
Then he&rsquo;d be like, &ldquo;What the %$#@&amp;* is wrong with you?! That was decades ago!&rdquo;
Yeah, it&rsquo;d be so worth it.
The poll will make sense once you&rsquo;ve listened to the episode. &nbsp;Also, I have trouble counting whores in this episode for some reason.
&nbsp;




Icing on ham is....



Disgusting! What is wrong with Melanie?!



Delicious! Kasey is a cullinary bigot!

            <description><![CDATA[In this installment, we attempt to analyze and review the 2009 anime series Soul Eater.&nbsp; Soul Eater is a shonen series about a group of teens who fight evil witches and demons and then consume their souls to become stronger.
No wait! Come back! The series is good I swear!
While the series does have many common shonen tropes, it executes them in style.&nbsp; The art looks as if Tim Burton and Tite Kubo of Bleach fame had a baby&hellip; and that baby could draw gooooood.&nbsp; The animation by Bones studio is top notch and very fluid in fight scenes.
It also has a wonderfully atypical heroine in Maka. How often are twelve year old girls allowed to be main characters in shonen fighting series?&nbsp; And said twelve year old girl isn&rsquo;t used for fanservice? How often do they have a twelve year old girl who is allowed to fight and win against opponents of both genders, and is even allowed to look totally unattractive when she&rsquo;s being a scary badass? &nbsp;It amazes me that more people don&rsquo;t realize how miraculously rare that is.
The series has been licensed for distribution in the U.S by Funimation and will be available as of 2010.&nbsp; The manga has been licensed by Yen Press and began coming out in October 2009.&nbsp; If you're interested in continuing the story of Soul Eater through the manga, the anime branches off from the manga at chapter 37.
Warning: We analyze the show as a whole.&nbsp; If you have not seen all 51 episodes, this installment will completely spoil the ending for you.&nbsp; Please, if you haven&rsquo;t seen all of the series, keep this episode in reserve until you do. Soul Eater is good enough that you&rsquo;re really doing yourself an injustice if you spoil the show for yourself.
I&rsquo;d love to hear your opinions on Soul Eater or our podcast in general. It&rsquo;s nice to know we&rsquo;re not just speaking into a void, ya know?
