			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently had business in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and paid a visit to the state capital and the assassination site of Louisiana Senator and Governor Huey Long. Long has been labeled an extremist, a socialist, and a crook by the Republican right with similar rhetoric as that being hurled at Barack Obama after the passage of the healthcare bill. I think Long deserves a new examination.</p>
<p>Huey Long served as governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932, and as Senator from 1932 to his death in 1935. Long’s Louisiana was a poster child for the Republican fears of Socialism: his “Every Man a King” was essentially a redistribution of wealth by taxing corporations. No wonder he’s been demonized! Like Ted Kennedy after him, Long, over time, has become a Republican posterchild for all that was wrong with “liberal” ideas out of control. A true progressive, Long stressed using the taxes to level the field across a poverty-stricken state. Some biographers believe Long could have defeated FDR in 1936 had he lived, and Republicans love to point out Long’s potential to become a dictator.</p>
<p>Long, however, was stopped by an assassin’s bullet.</p>
<p>And this brings me to my point: Long’s alleged assassin, Dr. Carl Allan Weiss, may or may not have fired a bullet at Long—but Long’s bodyguards responded with panic and shot Weiss about sixty times. Long may have been hit by a bullet fired from Weiss, or he may have been killed by his own, overzealous entourage.</p>

		<itunes:summary>I recently had business in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and paid a visit to the state capital and the assassination site of Louisiana Senator and Governor Huey Long. Long has been labeled an extremist, a socialist, and a crook by the Republican right with similar rhetoric as that being hurled at Barack Obama after the passage of the healthcare bill. I think Long deserves a new examination.

Huey Long served as governor of Louisiana from 1928 to 1932, and as Senator from 1932 to his death in 1935. Long’s Louisiana was a poster child for the Republican fears of Socialism: his “Every Man a King” was essentially a redistribution of wealth by taxing corporations. No wonder he’s been demonized! Like Ted Kennedy after him, Long, over time, has become a Republican posterchild for all that was wrong with “liberal” ideas out of control. A true progressive, Long stressed using the taxes to level the field across a poverty-stricken state. Some biographers believe Long could have defeated FDR in 1936 had he lived, and Republicans love to point out Long’s potential to become a dictator.

Long, however, was stopped by an assassin’s bullet.

And this brings me to my point: Long’s alleged assassin, Dr. Carl Allan Weiss, may or may not have fired a bullet at Long—but Long’s bodyguards responded with panic and shot Weiss about sixty times. Long may have been hit by a bullet fired from Weiss, or he may have been killed by his own, overzealous entourage.

Whatever Weiss did, shoot Long or physically assault him, the purpose was political, and Weiss’s daring was driven by rage.

It is natural for the two political parties to call each other’s leaders extremists or buffoons. Name calling and mudslinging are as American a cliché as apple pie, but inciting violence is not. The Huey Long-style descriptions of Obama from rightwing radio hosts, and the increased rhetoric about a civil war, about Jefferson’s call for revolution, or about claims that it’s the end of the free market system, and that the president has destroyed the nation–all of this behavior is dangerous. Sarah Palin even went so far as to use gun metaphors (let’s reload) and release a map with people who voted for the healthcare bill pointed out by the crosshairs of a rifle scope. This is completely inappropriate.

This nation is has remained strong because of peaceful transitions of power. Jefferson’s famous revolution quotation which has become the mantra of the right is about the ultimate revolution—a free election to vote the bums out, and not about creating a new civil war. Painting the opposition in extremist terms from labels like Socialist to the vandalistic drawing of swastikas and Hitler moustaches over campaign posters is taking things too far and is leading, more and more, to outrage on both sides.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>1). Health insurance is out of control. I know that many Republicans argue that insurance reform and health reform are different issues, but I find them inexorably linked. You cannot reform healthcare without reforming insurance—and the first steps to address reforming the insurance situation are addressed by the bill: 1) repeal of pre-existing conditions and 2) stopping the process dropping people because of illness. See Paul Krugman’s The Conscience of a Liberal from last week’s NY Times. Does the bill do enough? NO. Is it a start? Yes. A few months ago I was ready to go against the bill because the Democrats had given up too much. I was convinced, however, by columnists Paul Krugman and E. J. Dionne that the bill is a much-needed start that can be amended and adjusted to the situation. I agree with conservatives that requiring people to buy health insurance is ridiculous. This provision, I believe, will eventually be adjusted. The point is to start the process and then, like Social Security and Medicare, both programs labeled by Republicans as Socialist when they were up for vote, the program can be improved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>2). Healthcare reform also requires capitalist reform as well. Yes, we have a free economy, and yes, we want the market to correct itself. However, leaving the market wide open and taking away all regulation— extreme laissez-faire espoused by the Hannity clan –clearly leads to the two conditions described above. The answer here is that some form of government regulation is needed — not meaning we turn “Socialist” and have the government take over all industry, but instead we use the government as a regulating force, preventing companies from hurting people in the name of making a profit. We’ve created a greed monster where the good of the company – or the rich – outweighs the good of the few.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>3). Yes, a system is in place now where people can get health attention in emergency rooms when they are sick and cannot afford to see a regular doctor. The government pays the bill when they leave the bill unpaid. This causes three problems: 1). emergency rooms are no longer efficient and are often unable to provide timely support for real “emergencies;” 2) it overworks doctors and nurses and limits the effectiveness of care; 3) it wastes money. Emergency care is the most expensive kind care, and it is only life-and-death care. The underlying problems often go unsolved as long as the life is saved, and the patient still cannot afford to seek a regular doctor. Doesn’t it make more sense to put a system in place to allow the patient to have actual healthcare rather than emergency care? Would it not be cheaper in the long run? Would it not create new jobs for primary care doctors and nurses and decrease our overcrowded emergency rooms? And, by addressing the overall health of the patient rather than facing a life-and-death situation and nothing else, wouldn’t it, in the long-run, allow the patient to potentially regain health and therefore become a more productive part of society and the workplace?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>4). I believe the government exists to protect its people. I am not advocating Socialism—I am, however, advocating a return to pre-Reagan America, to the New Deal, and to a larger government that is able to provide me with what I need: the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>5). We have a moral imperative as a nation to take care of our poor. It astounds me that the argument against healthcare appears so tax and finance-driven. What about our duty to assist other individuals? Why can’t that duty extend from the occasional person (who has the money) donating to charity to the creation of a truly efficient central government that can attack the problem of poverty at its core?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>6). Healthcare is part of the new class warfare. As discussed and defined in a recent New Republic article, the post-Reagan Republicans have grown obsessed with stopping anything that shifts money from the upper classes to the lower classes. As a result of the Republican economic policies, the upper class has flourished, the lower class has exploded, and the middle class, the backbone of this nation and its economy, has all but disappeared. The gap between upper class and everyone else has grown substantially. President Truman, in announcing the quest for a healthcare program, a quest that lasted over fifty years, said healthcare for the rich supersedes healthcare for the poor. This is not right. In answer to the often-asked question, is healthcare a privilege or a right, my answer is that it is every bit the right of every American and the government should work to provide it, just like every other major nation on earth does. By not providing it, we damage our reputation across the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Republicans have thrown the label “socialist” about throughout this debate. There is a distinct difference between government regulation and government control. There is also a difference between the government owning industry, and the government participating in the some industries to uphold the economy. Instead of throwing about the Socialist label, the Republicans should look back at Orwell’s Animal Farm, the allegorical dissection of the Communist movement, which warns us of a world that the conservatives have taken steps to create. After wrapping themselves in the Jeffersonian mantra that all men (animals) are created equal, those who have taken power, who have destroyed the middle class, and who now seek to maintain power and fortune for themselves at the top, those leaders amend the Jeffersonian words to fit their new ideal: All men are created equal; but some are more equal than others. By arguing against the need for healthcare for our lower classes, by claiming that people should “work” for what their healthcare, and by refusing to pay taxes to support the poor, the conservative movement has become the embodiment of Orwell’s words.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>I think I&#8217;ve finally figured out what my conservative friends want concerning <span>healthcare</span>.  By friends I don&#8217;t mean the arrogant incompetents of talk radio&#8211;I mean the average Republican Joe, or Tea Party Ted.  They&#8217;re not intentionally selfish, despite how things sound&#8211;&#8221;I don&#8217;t want higher taxes or a bigger government, so screw the poor, to heck with those who are ill, forget preexisting conditions or the handicapped&#8211;I&#8217;m in a good place medically and financially right now, so I think the system is fine.&#8221;  No, most of them are not like that at all&#8211;although their party leaders and propagandists are.  Instead, my friends have been taken in by the seemingly logical mantra of the right:  big government is bad; small government is good.  Since there will always be some form of government (or lat least we hope there is), we must assume what the right is arguing is a strong, centralized federal government is bad, and therefore the power should be retained by the states.</span></p>
<p>States right,s yes?  Haven&#8217;t you heard the conservatives argue for this over and over?</p>
<p>Message to the Republicans:  We&#8217;ve tried it.  Twice.  The first time was in 1787 with the Articles of the Confederation.  The result was a central government so weak it could not respond to crisis.  That&#8217;s why we drafted the constitution, that document my conservative friends use as a clothing accessory on a day-to-day basis, literal interpreters of its every golden word.  You want to ditch the constitution to return to the mess we had before drafting it?</p>
<p><span>The second, more successful US experimentation with confederation was, of course, by the southern states during the Civil War.  That didn&#8217;t work out so well either.  While President Lincoln was able to stretch the powers of the fed to meet the crisis, his counterpart Jeff Davis was hampered by the various states that didn&#8217;t want to raise taxes to fight the war, problems with the draft, and other states-rights concerns.  To paraphrase an argument from the right, if you liked the efficiency of the south&#8217;s government, you&#8217;ll love the efficiency of the warring state governments.  Can you imagine, in a time of military or financial crisis, the governors of NY, TX, and CA all agreeing on a course of action?</span></p>
<p>In all honesty, I choose to believe my friends are taken in by the states rights argument and are not as selfish as the Republican party appears to be.  If not, then we have a fundamental, irreconcilable difference in our viewpoints of not only what it means to be an American, but also in our outlooks as human beings.
