<p>About &#8220;Sunday School&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to share with you my first short film &#8220;Sunday School&#8221; on www.thebsideshow.com!
The film was shot, edited and produced by myself.  The film is meant to bring to light choices that young people are forced to make to better themselves, elicit conversation about these issues as well as showcase my passion for storytelling.  This is a first in many new editions of The B Side Show TV.  Not saying that I am abandoning my podcast edition of The B Side Show, that’s where it all started, but my focus will shift a bit more to the TV edition in the 2012.   
Sunday School has also been entered into the 7 Billion Action Film Contest.   Voting begins February 26th, 2012 but please visit the site, view the film and leave comments.  Every view counts! http://7billionactions.votigo.com/contests/showentry/993198
Until next time, peace!</p>

<p>I&#8217;m back with the 1st new show of the new year!  For this new edition of The B Side Show I&#8217;m getting to know singer/songwriter Yahzarah.  She&#8217;s currently signed to Foreign Exchange Music and recently released her wonderful album &#8220;The Ballad of Purple St. James&#8221;.  We were chatting like old friends (especially in the last segment) about everything from her start in music, her working and touring with Erykah Badu, finding her own sound and even a few myths about us little (slim) people!  Really great and in depth interview with Miss &#8220;Purple St. James&#8221;, be sure to check it out!</p>
<p>NEW ARTIST SPOTLIGHT: JALYN</p>
<p>For the first New Artist Spotlight of the new year I&#8217;m introducing you to the music of California native Jalyn.  He sings, raps, produces, writes and I&#8217;m debuting his single &#8220;Summer of 88&#8243; on the show!</p>
<p>This show also features an all AQUARIUS playlist!  Technically the Aquarius season is over but if you don&#8217;t already know, WE SHINE YEAR ROUND!  Get familiar with us!</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t already be sure to pick up a copy of my first book of poetry QuietStorm Vol 1. sold everywhere books are sold online. I&#8217;ve been getting so much great feedback from the book and I am truly proud of the outcome and its success, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</p>

Peace!

I'm back with the 1st new show of the new year!  For this new edition of The B Side Show I'm getting to know singer/songwriter Yahzarah.  She's currently signed to Foreign Exchange Music and recently released her wonderful album "The Ballad of Purple St. James".  We were chatting like old friends (especially in the last segment) about everything from her start in music, her working and touring with Erykah Badu, finding her own sound and even a few myths about us little (slim) people!  Really great and in depth interview with Miss "Purple St. James", be sure to check it out!

NEW ARTIST SPOTLIGHT: JALYN

For the first New Artist Spotlight of the new year I'm introducing you to the music of California native Jalyn.  He sings, raps, produces, writes and I'm debuting his single "Summer of 88" on the show!

This show also features an all AQUARIUS playlist!  Technically the Aquarius season is over but if you don't already know, WE SHINE YEAR ROUND!  Get familiar with us!

If you haven't already be sure to pick up a copy of my first book of poetry QuietStorm Vol 1. sold everywhere books are sold online. I've been getting so much great feedback from the book and I am truly proud of the outcome and its success, THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

http://missshay.tumblr.com/

I've also created a tumblr page which can be found on missshay.tumblr.com. It's very different from my show's blog (RIP), more personal, less business. Be sure to check it out and if you're on tumblr, follow a chick!

Until next time, peace!

<p>As a way to kick off the NEW year, I&#8217;ve decided to try something NEW and introduce a project that I have been working on!  As you probably know I have a book of poetry (QuietsStorm Vol. 1 for those that don&#8217;t know) filled with pieces that are very dear to my heart *tear*.  I wanted to share some of my work in a spoken form while fusing music and sound to evoke emotion for the listener.  &#8220;The Way We Were&#8221; is one of my favorite poems featured in the book and seems to be a favorite of many who have purchased it so I decided to create the spoken version of it and share it with you, my listeners!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never done anything like this and am extremely happy that I could share it with you. Everything was recorded and edited by myself.  I used clips from some of my favorite movies and songs to add to the theme of the piece and in my opinion they really helped bring it to life.  &#8220;The Way They Were&#8221; will be avaliable to stream and download for all soon (you&#8217;re getting the goods before everybody else). In the future I will be releasing more selected pieces which will be EXCLUSIVE to my podcast subscribers as a way of saying THANK YOU for riding with me!  I&#8217;ll continue to bring you new and entertaining content whether it be on the actual show, spoken word OR video (more on that later).  Anyone who has purchased QuietStorm Vol. 1 and has a suggestion on poems they would like to hear transformed please feel free to email me at thebsideshow@yahoo.com!</p>
<p>Once again THANK YOU, HAPPY NEW YEAR and ENJOY!</p>

<p>Gripping your heart and touching your soul author Shavon Meyers brings life back to the art of poetry with the release of:</p>
<p>“QuietStorm Vol. 1 (Poeticallycomplexforwardthinkingsimplicities)”</p>
<p>Brooklyn, NY-November 24th 2008-Remember the feeling you had when you opened the book that changed your outlook on life?  Prepare to experience that feeling once more. Poet and radio host Shavon Meyers brings to life that feeling and much more in her first publication “QuietStorm Vol. 1 (Poeticallycomplexforwardthinkingsimplicities) (108 pp, Outskirts Press, Inc, $9.95).  </p>
<p>From the heartache and confusion of a solider at war, to the lost of innocence from a victim of sexual abuse, to the feeling of abandonment through the eyes of society’s forgotten homeless and even the regretful state of a drug addict, Shavon takes readers through life’s hardships from the point of view of every race, sex and creed leaving nothing to the imagination.
The love and passion for writing is shown not only through Shavon’s ability to showcase life’s harsh realities but also through her poems of love, hope, happiness, triumph and spirituality. All have been brought together in this exceptionally crafted work of art that bridges the gap between generations and inspires all who read it. </p>
<p>Shavon currently resides in Brooklyn NY.  She is the host of her own radio show on www.thebsideshow.com and her daily thoughts can be read on her blog at http://blog.thebsideshow.com. A portion of the proceeds from QuietStorm Vol. 1 will be donated to The Women&#8217;s Organization of Rebirth Through Healing (W.O.R.T.H.). www.youreworthit.org   </p>

What's good?  I have to say this is by far the best show I've ever done!  You should already know what this new show is all about.  I'm speaking on the victory of our next President Barack Obama!  As you know I've been on the fence with the whole election, its process and the government, but this is history and I can honestly say that I believe a change may come. Check out the show to see how my views have changed (slightly lol).
 
NEW ARTIST SPOTLIGHT:
JESSE BOYKINS III
 
For my new artist spotlight, I caught up with Jesse Boykins III at the recent Rock The Vote show at SOB's in NYC.  I got to talk with him about his music, his band and of course his new album entitled "The Beauty Created" plus I'm debuting his single "Chanel" from his upcoming album on the show as well.
  
Don't forget to check out the new black spotlight, my official blog on blog.thebsideshow.com (I update it daily) and my 1st book of poetry QuietStorm Vol.1 available online wherever books are sold!! 

Until next time, peace!!!
