<p>If you&#8217;re planning a trip to Sydney, Australia in November, then there are five things about Sydney weather in November you should know. So read on, for tips about what to expect, what to pack, and more!</p>
<p>#1: It Can Get HOT!</p>
<p>Sydney, like other cities in the Southern Hemisphere, experience their summers over the end of the calender year &#8211; so when it&#8217;s snowing in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun is out in Sydney! Average tempratures during the day are around 24 degrees celsius, or 75 farhenheit, but the highest November temprature ever measured in the city was more than 40 degrees celsius, or 107 farhenheit! </p>
<p>Make sure wherever you book, there&#8217;s air conditioning, because in Sydney, November can be very hot indeed!</p>
<p>#2: It&#8217;ll Probably Rain</p>
<p>Sydney experiences rainfall all year round &#8211; although it&#8217;s hardly ever very cold rain! In fact, the average volume of rain per month of the year only differs by a few milliliters per month, so you&#8217;re likely to have at least one rainy day if you stay in the city for a while &#8211; even in summer!</p>
<p>Summer rains in Sydney are refreshing though, so if you don&#8217;t like getting wet, buy an umbrella, but don&#8217;t let a little rain stop you from exploring and enjoying the outdoors in the city!</p>
<p>#3: It Can Get Chilly</p>
<p>Snow in Sydney is unheard of &#8211; especially in November. However, you should know that even in November, and in other summer months, it&#8217;s not impossible for the temprature to fall to around 15 degrees celsius, or 60 degrees farhenheit. The lowest temprature recorded for this time of year, in fact, is around 7.7 degrees celsius, or 46 degrees farhenheit!</p>
<p>The good news is that even when it&#8217;s a little cold in Sydney in November, a sweater or coat is all you&#8217;ll need to get through it. So leave your scarves and down filled coats at home! </p>
<p>#4: It&#8217;s the Second Sunniest Month of the Year!</p>
<p>In November, Sydney gets, on average, around 234 hours of sunlight. That means that the only month with more sunny hours is December! The sun in the Southern Hemisphere is particularly dangerous, in terms of UV rays though, so make sure you stock up on a high SPF sunscreen before or after you arrive for your Sydney holiday!</p>
<p>#5: It&#8217;s Perfect for Outdoor Activities!</p>
<p>The final thing you need to know, when it comes to our most important 5 things about Sydney Weather in November is that it&#8217;s absolutely perfect for outdoor activities. Hiking, swimming, bicycling, picnics and other outdoor and adventure activities are the order of the day for locals and visitors alike. So if you love outdoor adventures, then this is a great city to visit in November!</p>
<p>The weather in Sydney is generally mild and temperate. In fact, you can visit the city anytime of the year, and expect to have clear skies and sunny days on at least a few of the days you&#8217;re in the city. However, the summer really is the best time to spend time in Sydney, and November is one of the best summer months to visit. So if you&#8217;re planning a trip down under, remember these tips, and plan accordingly!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sydney has many fishing spots where holiday experienced anglers and amateur anglers can enjoy fishing. Here are some of my favourite spots:</p>
<p>Sydney Harbour</p>
<p>Pigs Reef off Watsons Bay is one of the most famous fishing spots in Sydney.  Autumn and winter are the best season to catch  tailor there. Yellowtail kingfish is  caught in summer while bream are in plenty during autumn.  Rushcutters Bay, Athol Bight and Rose Bay are excellent spots to enjoy fishing from May to October for John Dory. For jewfish lovers, Bradleys Head is the spot to go. Eastern wall of the Opera House is another superb fishing spot for tailor at night. North Head has an abundance of snapper, trevally, tailor and bream.</p>
<p>Port Hacking</p>
<p>Gunnamatta Bay</p>
<p>People who seek baitfish such as pilchards and yellowtail frequent this place. There is also a lot of tailor, bream, flathead and leather jackets. It&#8217;s a comfortable site to fish with seats and a long jetty.</p>
<p>Lilli Pilli</p>
<p>This is an immensely popular place to fish, so you have to be there early to get yourself a prime spot. It is a secluded place but with an abundance of fish on offer. You will be able to catch whiting, flathead and bream with fresh bait. Lilli Pilli also offers parking, public toilets and rock pool.</p>
<p>Parramatta River</p>
<p>Gladesville Wharf</p>
<p>This is one of the best places to catch the elusive jewfish. The best time to visit this place is after 9 pm when it is less busy.  While fishing at this spot use fresh quid and live yellowtail as bait. Also, to be really well equipped, you could use a 30 lb line, 12ft rod and a matching reel. Gladesville Wharf also has plenty of bream as well.</p>
<p>Cabarita Wharf</p>
<p>This place contains many open areas for casting and bright lights. Go there after 9pm (time of last ferry) to enjoy hassle free fishing. Here, you can catch some lovely bream and squid.</p>
<p>Georges River</p>
<p>Tom Uglys Bridge</p>
<p>This place is arguably one of the most popular fishing spot during the weekends. It is a perfect place to fish late in the night because you can park your car where you cast. With fresh baits, you can catch tailor and bream. </p>
<p>Captain Cooks Bridge</p>
<p>This is another fishing spot to try your luck for the elusive jewfish, who mostly stick near the pylons. </p>
<p>Georges River National Park</p>
<p>This is a quiet place with lots of small sandy beaches on low tide and picnic areas. While here, you will be able to catch  small bream and flathead. Be on the look out as jet skis and speed boats constantly pass through that area. It&#8217;s easily accessible., but sometimes quite busy as a result.</p>
<p>The Greater Sydney Region</p>
<p>There are plenty of fishing maps around Sydney region to guide you to various fishing destinations. Each fishing spot offers its own variety of fish. Make sure you are aware of fishing regulations &#8211; the inspectors have a habit of turning up unannounced and if you don&#8217;t have a fishing licence, it can really ruin your days fishing.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re planning to be in Sydney for New Years Eve, you&#8217;re in for a treat! The city really does go all out to show in the New Year with a bang! However, while it&#8217;s certainly a great place to wring in the New Year, you may find that finding budget friendly New Years Eve accommodation in Sydney is a little trickier than you&#8217;d like! </p>
<p>Here are my top tips if you&#8217;re still looking for New Years Eve accommodation in Sydney that won&#8217;t break the bank:</p>
<p>Book Early</p>
<p>It may be a little late to say that you should book early when looking for accommodation for New Years Eve in Sydney, but it&#8217;s always a good idea! Some hotels and accommodation establishments even have policies that only allow them to accept New Years Eve bookings from a certain date, so when you contact them, find out when you may book, and make a note to do it! Budget friendly New Years Eve accommodation in Sydney is not all that common, and it tends to fill up fast, so you want to make sure that you&#8217;re ahead of the curve on this one!</p>
<p>Look On the Internet</p>
<p>One of the best ways to find budget friendly New Years Eve accommodation in Sydney is to search on the internet. Don&#8217;t just go to well known hotel sites though &#8211; consider local online classifieds too &#8211; you may find hidden gems that you wouldn&#8217;t find elsewere. </p>
<p>Consider Hostels</p>
<p>Another good idea, if you&#8217;re looking for budget friendly Sydney accommodation for New Years Eve, is to consider a hostel, rather than a hotel. They&#8217;re not as luxurious as hotels, and you might share a room with fellow travellers (not a problem if you&#8217;re travelling in a group!) However, they are usually much cheaper than hotels, and they are generally quite near to the &#8216;action.&#8217;</p>
<p>Enquire About Pub accommodation</p>
<p>There are a surprising number of pubs in Sydney that also offer accommodation. The type of accommodation varies, and many offer shared bathroom facilities, but they&#8217;re usually cheaper than hotels, and they&#8217;re usually conveniently located. In fact, you&#8217;re perfectly located, above a pub, to have a little pre New Year&#8217;s Eve party of your own!</p>
<p>Consider Cockatoo Island!</p>
<p>Most people don&#8217;t think camping when they think New Years Eve accommodation in Sydney, however, that&#8217;s exactly what you will find on Cockatoo Island! What&#8217;s more, the island is located right in the middle of the Sydney Harbour, and there&#8217;s no better place to see the fireworks from. It&#8217;s not all tents and sleeping under the stars either &#8211; there are chalets and holiday apartments too, so if roughing it is not your thing, you do have options!</p>
<p>Chain Hotels and Motels</p>
<p>Finally, there are the chain hotels and motels in the city. Usually, they&#8217;re not nearly as luxurious as their big name cousins, but they do the job admirably if you&#8217;re only looking for a place to lay your head in between exploring the city or partying up a storm! Better yet, many have websites, where you can check availability and make bookings, so it couldn&#8217;t be simpler to get the accommodation you need.</p>
<p>It is possible to enjoy New Years Eve in Sydney without spending a small fortune on accommodation. You might not get the same level of luxury you could expect at a top hotel, but most of the accommodation<br />
 is perfectly clean, convenient and serviceable, and after all, you&#8217;re in the city to get OUT of your accommodation &#8211; not spend time indoors looking at the walls! So think outside the box a little, and you should find that you can still find budget friendly New Years Eve accommodation in Sydney. </p>

If you&#8217;re looking for New Years Eve accomodation in Sydney, chances are you already have a few criteria &#8211; budget, level of luxury and possibly even the view you&#8217;d like from your hotel window. However, there are a few other things you should bear in mind before you book New Years Eve accomodation in Sydney, and when you book.</p>
<p>Which Event Will You Be Attending?</p>
<p>Sydney is a major destination for New Years Eve, and while that means that there are plenty of events on offer, it also means that getting to those events can be tricky at times. It&#8217;s a good idea to decide ahead of time which of the events in the city you will be attending, and to book your accomodation near to their location. That not only makes it easier to get to the event, but also to get home! </p>
<p>Are You a Reveller, or a More Sedate Traveller?</p>
<p>Another important thing to remember is that in Sydney, some areas can have New Years Eve events that last well into the wee hours of the morning. If you like to party up a storm, then being in the thick of things, in the hot spots in the city is a good idea. However, if you prefer to end your revelling a little earlier, then you might want to choose accomodation a little further outside of the party areas! Being further outside of the city center and it&#8217;s parties also means you&#8217;re closer to New Year&#8217;s Day attractions, like the best beaches, when you wake up in the morning. </p>
<p>Left Your Booking Too Late? Look Outside of the City Center</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve left booking New Years Eve accomodation in Sydney a little too late, and are finding that everywhere you call, there&#8217;s just no room, you may find that outside of the center of the city, you have more luck. City center accomodation in Sydney, particularly for New Year&#8217;s Eve, tends to get booked up very early on! However, the further outside of the city center you go, the more likely you are to find one or two establishments that still have accomodation available.</p>
<p>Private Accomodation Options</p>
<p>Sydney has plenty of accomodation options available, so if you&#8217;re not finding the hotel accomodation you need, you might want to consider some of the others. Bed and breakfast establishments are one, and hostels are another. There are even private apartments to rent in many areas of the city. So make sure you cast your accomodation seeking net wide, and you should find what you&#8217;re looking for. </p>
<p>Think Outside the Box &#8211; Hire a Houseboat!</p>
<p>One of the biggest attractions in Sydney at New Year&#8217;s Eve is the fireworks over the harbour. However, accomodation that has clear, direct views of the festivities tends to be very expensive! If you&#8217;re on a more modest budget, particularly if you are travelling in a group, hiring a houseboat, and watching from the water might be just the ticket! Houseboat hire is available for boats of various sizes and luxury levels, and they are often cheaper per person than hotel accomodation! </p>
<p>Sydney is a great place to spend New Year&#8217;s Eve, and while accomodation can be tricky to find &#8211; especially accomodation that meets all your requirements! Make a point of thinking about exactly what you need, and book early! That, along with these tips, should ensure that your New Year&#8217;s Eve in Sydney is a fabulous experience! </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re a parent, then you know that travelling with kids is never simple. In fact, selecting a destination that keeps both you and your kids happy is a tricky business, and even more so when one or more of your kids is a toddler! To make things a little simpler, I&#8217;ve listed my top 5 things to do with toddlers in Sydney (and the central coast), so that you can decide whether this is the right destination for your family!</p>
<p>#1 &#8211; Visit the Taronga Zoo</p>
<p>Most toddlers love animals &#8211; and there are plenty of those at the Taronga Zoo! Tiger cubs, the Gorilla Forest and Asian Elephants are just a few of the <a href="http://www.partypoker.com/">fun</a> and fascinating exhibitions that you and your toddler will see at the zoo. There are also daily activities and talks, and Animal encounters that let kids get up close and personal with some of the friendlier animals in the zoo. Definitely fun for the whole family, and guaranteed to keep even the most energetic toddler spellbound for the day!<br />
<img src="http://www.thesydneyvisitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/061231tarongazoo.jpg" alt="tarongazoo" title="tarongazoo" class="alignright size-full wp-image-216" /><br />
#2 &#8211; Visit the Sydney Aquarium</p>
<p>Another animal themed day trip that will keep the whole family entertained and enthralled is the Sydney Aquarium. From Dugongs to &#8216;Nemo&#8217;s&#8217; in the flesh, to sawfish, they&#8217;ll love the colors, the exhibits, and everything else. Plus, if you time your visit carefully, you can watch one of the feedings or talks. </p>
<p>#3 &#8211; Get Wet at Vera&#8217;s Water Garden!</p>
<p>Vera&#8217;s Water Garden at The Entrance is a great place to take toddlers, and older children. There are pools, fountains and other fun filled water attractions in the garden, and it&#8217;s a great choice if you have children of different ages &#8211; thanks to the various pools and activities. </p>
<p>#4 &#8211; Picnic in Bicentennial Park</p>
<p>Bicentennial Park, also known as Sydney&#8217;s Olympic Park, is a great day trip for families with toddlers. There are picnic and barbeque facilities, playgrounds, walking trails and fountains to splash in, all contained within the boundaries of the park. In fact, if you like, you don&#8217;t even have to bring your own lunch &#8211; because there are cafes and restaurants in the park too! Let the kids run around on the lawns, while you watch from the shade.</p>
<p>#5 &#8211; Explore Science at the Powerhouse Museum</p>
<p>Museums can be boring for toddlers &#8211; they don&#8217;t appreciate static exhibits as much as the rest of us! However, the Powerhouse Museum is different. It&#8217;s a museum dedicated to all things technology and science related, and nearly everything in here moves, lights up, or otherwise entrances little people! There are also special exhibitions devoted to kid friendly things &#8211; like the famous Wiggles, and to arts and crafts that let kids get their hands dirty. Another great choice if you have kids of varying ages!</p>
<p>There really is something for everyone in Sydney &#8211; and it&#8217;s especially family friendly. Aside from the attractions I&#8217;ve mentioned here, there&#8217;s also paddle boat rides, bush walks, a working farm to visit and more. So no matter what your toddler likes, there&#8217;s sure to be something to amuse, entice and excite them, every day of your stay! In fact, Sydney is probably one of the very best cities to visit if you have small children to keep amused on your vacation!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Australian Beaches have a reputation across the world for their beauty and cleanliness, and with good reason.  Australian beaches have beautiful golden sands, they are generally very large, and the surf offers something to everyone from the casual bather to the most hardened wave-rider.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.thesydneyvisitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/bondi-to-coogee-walk10.jpg" alt="Bronte Beach" title="Bronte-beach" class="alignright size-full wp-image-209" /><br />
The sand at most Australian beaches is unlike many other places in the world.  The sand is golden in colour and extremely fine.  There is rarely a rock or piece of coral to be found, meaning that it is ideal for sunbathing, as well as for a variety of active and not-so-active sports, like frisbee and beach volleyball.</p>
<p><!--adsense--></p>
<p>Sydney is the best known Australian city for beaches and the beach lifestyle. Sydney&#8217;s beaches are well known for their good surf, and many are host to international iron-man events, beach volleyball competitions, and Sydney-siders enjoying the beach lifestyle b y lapping up the sun.</p>
<p><!--adsense--></p>
<p>Some beaches don&#8217;t allow surfing, but other popular pastimes include boogie-boarding, snorkelling and kayaking.</p>
<p>Many of Sydney&#8217;s beaches have surf-lifesaving patrols, both full-time and volunteers, as well as shark nets and shrak spotting helicopters.</p>
<p>There are more than 70 beaches in the Greater Sydney area, meaning that you don&#8217;t need to go far to see one when you visit Sydney.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular beaches include <a href="http://www.thesydneyvisitor.com/bondi-beach-and-the-bondi-to-coogee-walk/">Bondi Beach</a>, <a href="http://www.manlyaustralia.com.au/">Manly Beach</a> and <a href="http://www.thesydneyvisitor.com/about-sydney/">Coogee</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Walking on Sydney Harbour Bridge is a highlight of this Sydney Attraction.  ]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perhaps the easiest and most enjoyable way to see Sydney Harbour Bridge is to walk along it. There is a pedestrian access on the eastern side of the bridge, which can be accessed at either end.  If you’re down in “The Rocks” area you can just follow the signs to “Harbour Bridge” and you’ll eventually find yourself faced with a set of stairs.</p>
<p>You simply climb the stairs (there’s not too many) and before you know it, you’re on a walkway to the Harbour Bridge. This walk is flat, leisurely and affords great views.  It can be quite noisy, since you’re walking at the same level as the traffic, but it’s great exercise, and you  can take as long as you like.</p>
<p>There is a museum that is about halfway along the bridge, where you can stop off and learn all that there is to know about the history and building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.   It will cost you a few dollars to enter, but the climb to the top and view is well worth it, as is some of the interesting trivia you can learn about the bridge whilst inside.  Allow half an hour or so to stop there and have a good look around.</p>
<p>On the Northern end of the bridge at Kirrabilli, there are plenty of parks and places to enjoy the magnificent views of the harbor, before returning back the way you came.</p>
<p>So If you really want to enjoy Sydney Harbour Bridge, then allowing a couple of hours for a walking trip is a great way to do it.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Jogging on the Beach in Australia is an ideal way to mix with Sydney locals.]]></description>
			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of Sydney&#8217;s most popular attractions are it&#8217;s beaches, and its no surprise that tehy&#8217;re a favourite destination for walking and jogging.</p>
<p>Even though Sydney is a major city with a thriving population, it is never a problem to wander down to your loca.l beach, throw the joggers on, and get in some brisk exercise.</p>
<p>On any given morning (although more so in summer than winter) most beaches will have a steady flow of morning exercisers, from the super-fit to the not-so-fit.  There aren&#8217;t many beaches that could be regarded as &#8220;crowded&#8221; during these early hours (say before 9am), although Sunday mornings can be a little less relaxing than any other day of the week, since plenty of people come out to play.  Lots are just looking for a coffee and lazy breakfast in one of the cafe&#8217;s that abound in most beach-side suburbs, although a few die-hard joggers can still be found.</p>
<p>Parking is rarely a problem if you get to the beach before 9, and you&#8217;ll generally only have to wander a couple of blocks down to the sand if you get there late.</p>
<p>The pick of Sydneys beaches for jogging would be Coogee, Manly and Dee Why, although just about any beach is ideal for an early morning walk or run.</p>
<p>For visitors who are looking to make the most of Sydneys attractions, a bit of exercise on the beach is a way to get a true feel for the city&#8217;s vibe, and to rub shoulders with the locals in their natural habitat.</p>
