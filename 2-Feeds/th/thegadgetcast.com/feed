			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This gizmo might sound like something out of the Arabian Nights fairytales. It is actually a plastic look alike of the bank vaults, only it opens by voice command and not with a combination of numbers or magical keys&#8230;<br />
Voice Activated Vault<br />
<img src="http://gadgets.in/images/news/safevault.jpg" alt="voice activated safe" /><br />
The manufacturers probably got their inspiration to make this unique gadget from the famous, and hilarious, television series â€˜Americaâ€™s Dumbest Criminalsâ€™. Only the dumbest criminal will not try to pry open this little gizmo that looks like a really heavy piece of iron mongery. The voice activated locking safe. This vault looks really impressive with its LCD, industrial leaver, huge combination knob and the makes. In fact this is a plastic safe that is easier to open than a can of sardines. This is no secret from the people who will be buying it, they are just depending on the camouflage effect this will have should any dumb crook happen to drop in for a look around. Though it is only the programmed voice that will open the safe, a dumb criminal might not know that the impressive mini vault is nothing but a heap of plastic he could probably cut open wit a pen knife.</p>
<p>It is a novelty item by itself. You could impress a lot of people with a vault in your home of office and also show off the high-tech voice activated locking system incorporated. But take care, the safer the safe, the more valuable the contents and word has a way of getting around.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People will do anything that needs to be done to sell their produce. Now, we are not saying that there is not science involved here, just that there is not that much science involved here. After all Tiger Woods is not the golfer he is because of the golf clubs he uses or the golf shoes he wears. Recently Callaway rolled out their Square-headed FTi driver made what they call â€˜fusion technologyâ€™. These drivers are claimed to be the straightest drivers the game has or will ever see. The square design is believed to move the weight of the club away from the center of gravity rendering increased horizontal and vertical stability while driving.<br />

<img src="http://gadgets.in/images/news/golftechnology1.jpg" alt="golfing gadget" /><br />
The technology enables the golfer to adjust the weight of the square driver to compensate for individual weaknesses. The looks of the square-driver will not get the clubs off the shelves of the stores, Callaway is hoping the technology will. By the way it is no coincidence they are called â€˜Square-headedâ€™ drivers, golfers are definitely more intelligent than golf-club manufacturers may think.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If youâ€™re not a do-it-yourself kind of person, this may be the first time you hear an ultrasonic tape measure and boy, are you lucky! An Ultrasonic tape measure, is a device to measure distance in feet or meter, calculates linear, cubic footage or square â€“ may it be in metric or standard measure.</p>
<p>However, unlike the old measuring tapes you use for calculating wall dimensions and other home renovation needs, an ultrasonic tape measure provides you with brilliant LCD screens to display all information you need. Most ultrasonic measurement tapes are designed in a compact, lightweight size to allow for easy carrying whether youâ€™re measuring the roof or basement.<br />
<a class="imagelink" href="http://thegadgetcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/ultrasonic_tape_measure.jpg" title="ultrasonic_tape_measure.jpg"><img id="image22" src="http://thegadgetcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/ultrasonic_tape_measure.thumbnail.jpg" alt="ultrasonic_tape_measure.jpg" /></a><br />
Even with its small size, an ultrasonic tape measure is a very powerful tool, measuring distances of up to twelve meters and approximately 40 feet. In addition, you donâ€™t need to add up numbers â€“ this state-of-the-art gadget can convert units from meter to feet and vice versa. With an ultrasonic tape measure, all the necessary information is clearly laid out on its vivid screen. </p>
<p>Beam your measurements up with laser ultrasonic tape measure</p>
<p>Unlike the old tape measure wherein you need to drag one end of the tape to the other end, the ultrasonic tape creates laser virtual points from start to end while measuring distance simultaneously.</p>
<p>The laser pointers of the ultrasonic tape measure are used to aim your device. Once the target is determined, it emits sound waves and calculates the time it takes before the sound bounces back to the device. For this reason, these advanced gadgets cannot guarantee 100% accuracy and may give out false readings due to various obstructions from the sound to the device, such as large furniture or walls. </p>
<p>Be aware that most ultrasonic tape measures should only be used within 20 to 50 feet and are best used indoors since they may become more vulnerable to false readings when used outdoors. Simply put, these advanced hand tools is recommended for measuring applications wherein you do not require accuracy.</p>
<p>You can even play with the ultrasonic tape measure while walking and measure the distance youâ€™ve gone. Another unique feature of most ultrasonic measuring tapes is that they are designed with a sleep mode, which automatically saves power and batteries. </p>
<p>With an ultrasonic tape measure, you can now achieve do-it-yourself painting or wallpaper jobs, carpet or tile set ups and other home renovation projects with ease, comfort and confidence.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since many people dread all the cleaning and scrubbing done with housework, an idea combined with robotics gave way to the development of robotic vacuum cleaner and presented those stuck with doing dirty work a reason to smile. </p>
<p>A robotic vacuum cleaner allows the users to clean floors, even without lifting the entire sofa. It simplifies your task of cleaning even dust not visible to the eye on hard to reach places by doing what it is programmed to do â€“ annihilate all dirt regardless of visibility.</p>
<p>The robotic vacuum cleaner, regardless of brand name, operates using its top and bottom infrared sensors. Some brands offer extra ultrasound or optical sensors for enhanced functionality. Robotic vacuum cleaners use these infrared sensors in navigating around different kinds of obstacles.</p>
<p><a class="imagelink" href="http://thegadgetcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/cleanmate.jpg" title="cleanmate.jpg"><img id="image23" src="http://thegadgetcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/cleanmate.thumbnail.jpg" alt="cleanmate.jpg" /></a><br />
Normally, a robotic vacuum cleaner that uses infrared start to navigate in the middle of a certain room and use algorithms to drive themselves around the space in different patterns. When these highly advanced vacuums clean a room, it sends out continuous infrared signals and as these signals bounce back, the robotics determines the clear spaces ahead.</p>
<p>Robotic vacuum cleaners are designed to change directions randomly when any kind of obstructions are on their way. Other more expensive robotic vacuums are integrated with preset programs, which the vacuums automatically rotate, moves forward or backward when a collision is on its path. </p>
<p>After the robotic vacuum cleaner has done its job, it travels back to its charging base. However, you are still responsible for shutting the charger off and sending the robotic off to a new task.</p>
<p>Do-It-Yourself Robotic Vacuum Upgrade</p>
<p>If, for some reason, the robotic vacuum fails to function, you can always try to find gadget experts to help you with the problem. For instance, some robotics hackers have developed a way to save money by solving how the robotic vacuum cleaner can go around the house. </p>
<p>If you wish to add extra features to your vacuum cleaner, you can learn a few tips on replacing new and advanced chips. Some robotics vacuum fanatics have develop new ways on giving the equipment eyes â€“ by putting your laptop with a USB cam above the vacuum, your robotics cleaner will now have its own vision system.  </p>
<p>Some people add laser or vision scanning to their robots, but most experts caution users that adding these features may be costly. Nevertheless, robotic vacuum cleaners, with or without upgrades, have made cleaning spaces a simple task.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While many people are mesmerized with the popularity of mp3 players, consumers are confused when it comes to mp4 players: are these gadgets an upgrade of the mp3 players? </p>
<p>Simply put, an mp3 player holds certain types of audio formats, while the mp4 players use an mpeg-4 container format and plays different kinds of audio. </p>
<p>Just like the mp3 players, the word â€œmp4â€ is the kind of computer formal, but for videos instead of music files. Mp4 players differ from mp3 players due to their ability to store and play videos, streaming capabilities and the ability to support all types of multimedia formats as well as advanced content such as 2D or 3D graphics.</p>
<p>Mp4 players are becoming more and more popular because not only do they store movies and videos, they can also perform as an mp3 player by storing and playing an entire music collection. However, you still need to use a computer to access internet and download movies, videos and other media to upload into your mp4 player.</p>
<p>The real advantage of choosing mp4 players rather than mp3 players is the systemâ€™s ability to perform with other electronics without bringing too much effort on the mp4 player users. This is an important quality of most media players since the more gadgets an mp4 player can connect to, the better it can perform. Meaning, most mp4 players can be attached to your television, personal computer, stereo components, laptops and other devices.</p>
<p>Mp4 Players are lightweight, pocket-sized portable DVD players</p>
<p>While portable DVD players use discs to play movies and videos, mp4 players store and play audio and movie files from your computer. Another large factor why many consumers choose mp4 players over portable DVD players is that the size of DVD players may be smaller compared to home DVD players; you still need to carry the discs for your movie enjoyment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, mp4 players are usually designed as pocket-sized, lightweight gadgets that are best for travel and daily use. Mp4 players are better than portable DVD players are because most mp4 players integrate extra features such as digital TV decoder, microphone, alarm clock, organizer, photo album and many more. </p>
<p>On the downside, watching movies or videos through an mp4 player for longer periods of viewing can harm the userâ€™s eyes due to its small screen. Nevertheless, why choose a DVD player and buy expensive DVDs when you can buy an iPod or other mp4 players and download a movie for very little?</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mp3 players are compact electronic gadgets, which are used in storing and playing music files in different sound formats. In choosing the most appropriate mp3 player for your needs, you need to be aware that these state-of-the-art gizmos have three distinct categories â€“ micro hard drive, flash-based and hard drive mp3 players.</p>
<p>Micro hard drive media players are usually compact and have a smaller internal storing capacity.  Majority of micro hard drive mp3 players can keep up to six gigabytes of files or around 1,500 songs. While many consumers choose micro hard drive players due to its lightweight, pocket-sized design, others are not too fond of the rechargeable batteries, which cannot be replaced for a new one.</p>
<p>If you want replaceable batteries, you should opt for flash-based mp3 players. Also designed with a lightweight and compact look, these kinds of mp3 players are usually low capacity media players. However, since they have no moving parts, flash-based mp3 players are known to be skip-free. </p>
<p>Since flash-based mp3 players use AA or AAA batteries, some consumers may think it would cost them more money for batteries. Contrary to popular belief, these flash-based mp3 players use up minimal power, making your batteries last longer. The only downside to choosing flash-based mp3 players is that they are typically designed with 32 MB (around ten songs) to 2GB (about 550 songs) of storage capacity. For this reason, many music collectors prefer mp3 players with larger space.</p>
<p>A perfect match: Hardcore Music Buffs and Hard Drive Based Mp3 Players </p>
<p>Hard drive-based mp3 players are the largest and heaviest kind of mp3 players in the market and they make up for this bulk by providing large internal storage capacities. Although the large storage capacity is the reason why many consumers choose these media players, this large storage can also be its weakness.</p>
<p>Most hard drive mp3 players can hold up to 10GB (roughly 3,000 songs), 20GB, 40GB and even 80 gigabytes (approximately 25,000 songs). Because of this, consumers that need to store an entire music collection with their mp3 player should go with this kind of gadget. However, be aware that these kinds of mp3 players are sensitive to movements such as jogging and could cause their internal hard drive to skip and interfere with your music enjoyment.</p>
<p>Other kinds of mp3 players integrate extra features such as photo albums, visual screens, video playbacks, FM radio tuner and recorder, digital voice recording and upgrades for consumersâ€™ entertainment needs. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some people grab the latest gadgets off the shelves at their favorite electronics store the minute the product is released. Other people, on the other hand, wait until these â€œlatest gadgetsâ€ become popular and read hundreds of reviews before owning one. Which kind of consumer are you?</p>
<p>There are both advantages and downsides of buying the latest gadgets. If youâ€™re the kind of person that can stick to a mobile phone or portable media player until it reaches the end of its life, then choosing the best and latest gadget can be a good thing, as long as you believe in the brand and the product itself. </p>
<p>However, when you buy the latest gadgets without consulting with expert or consumer reviews, it can either be a risk of losing valuable money or being completely satisfied with the item you bought. Simply put, when you buy the latest gadgets, may it be a mobile phone, a personal computer, a digital camera or a camcorder, a portable gaming system or DVD player, you are setting yourself on a gamble. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you trust a manufacturer with your money or have had good experience with other products they manufactured, it is your decision if you want to be one of the first people to own the possible â€œnext big thingâ€.</p>
<p>Choosing the latest gadgets for your needs</p>
<p>If you decided to buy the latest gadgets, make sure the item can be a valuable addition to your home, office or vehicle. However, if you have extra money to spare, then you can splurge all you want â€“ besides, all gadgets you add to your collection is a great investment because it can perform as you need it to.</p>
<p>In choosing the latest gadgets, there are three important factors to consider â€“ price, function and features. If you are deciding on buying mobile electronics such as a cell phone, check to see if all your needs can be met â€“ is the phone 3G-oriented? Does it have a high-resolution camera? Are there built-in games? Does it allow for additional external space? Does it have an mp3 player? Make sure that all other requirements you want to have on your mobile phone are present to maximize your moneyâ€™s worth.</p>
<p>Regardless of type of latest gadgets out in the market, may it be portable or home media, digital cameras or camcorders, mobile phones, laptops or other computers, compact gadgets and others, make sure that the features, functionality and price can fit your personal needs.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gizmos have become part of oneâ€™s life â€“ from the mobile phones that is used in communicating, to the portable media players used for relaxation. Even in the business world, the importance of gizmos has become very apparent due to the hundreds of personal computers that are operated daily. </p>
<p>Look at how certain gizmos can help oneâ€™s life become easier. A typical person wakes up in the morning with an alarm clock, whether from his mobile phone or a radio-alarm clock. The person then checks his messages on his answering machine and mobile phone. </p>
<p>When driving to work or for an out-of-town trip, a typical person still uses different kinds of gizmos. For instance, he uses his GPS system to navigate his way around traffic and unknown streets. Upon arriving at his workstation, he opens his personal computer, checks his e-mail messages, communicates with clients through his noise canceling headset, gives a seminar using his portable presentation device, saves his daily work on a 1GB hard drive space for backup and goes home.</p>
<p>Imagine how this person can go through a day without his gizmos â€“ it would be pure chaos. Simply put, gizmos simplifies a personâ€™s life by speeding up each task and helping a person organize, manage his time, save his work and correspond easily with communication gizmos.</p>
<p>Gizmos as Stress Relievers</p>
<p>Gizmos are not used only for business use; it is even used for personal relaxation, enjoyment and stress relievers. If a typical person goes home from work, he is normally stressed out from the daily hustle and bustle of his work environment. </p>
<p>In managing stress, most people rely on their beloved flat screen TVs with a home entertainment system to liven up the sound and using a universal remote to make things even easier. Some resort to playing games on their laptops, while others play games with their Xbox or PlayStation and even relax on the couch with their latest mp3 player.</p>
<p>At the end of the week when all the work has been done with the help of his daily gizmos, a typical person spends time with his loved ones, family or friends and captures each moment with his digital camera or state-of-the-art camcorder. As he goes home, he loads the pictures or videos up on his computer using a card reader and saves his memories on a CD or DVD for future viewing.</p>
<p>Gizmos can be used both for personal and business matters. Although some may not choose to accept it, but gizmos have become a part of oneâ€™s life and many people can become lost or unorganized without them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Electronic Gadgets â€“ the Perfect Gift Any Day of the Year</p>
<p>In todayâ€™s technological world, people are rushing to the mall to view the latest electronic gadgets. Who wouldnâ€™t? These gizmos and gadgets, which range from the lightweight mp3 players and mobile phone to the extravagant camcorders and portable DVD players, have become part of everyday life.</p>
<p>Although you may have set your mind on certain electronic gadgets for yourself, buying them as gifts can become a different story. Of course, you have to consider the price for each item you buy. </p>
<p>If you shop around online or in any electronic gadgets marketplace, you will discover that there is a plethora of selection for each kind of gadget. Therefore, before looking for gifts and becoming overwhelmed by your choices, narrow it down to the kind of gadget, whether it may be mp3 players, state-of-the-art remotes, portable audio players or whichever you wish to buy, and then settle on a budget range.</p>
<p>When you have decided on the price range and kind of gadget to buy, determine whether you want the items to be used in the office, at home or for travel. </p>
<p>If youâ€™re going to give gifts for a group and have a budget of less than Rs 1,000 for each, you may consider electronic gadgets such as the Skype Phone, Key Chain Remote, Golf Scope, Robotic Reading Light, USB Massager, and Wristband watch just to name a few.</p>
<p>If you can spare Rs 1,000 more, you can opt for Wireless Car MP3 Transmitter, Ultrasonic Tape Measure, Personal Air Purifier, MP3 Player and many more. </p>
<p>Splurge your money with the trendiest electronic gadgets</p>
<p>If money is not an option for you, buying electronic gadgets can be an easier task. However, you should still narrow down your choices from portables, home use and office use.</p>
<p>For home use, the most sought-after gizmos are PlayStation or Xbox, complete entertainment theatre systems, flat-screen TVs, e-book readers and advanced PDAs. </p>
<p>Choosing electronic gadgets for the office can become tricky since the gifts will depend on how formal your office runs. If your office is like Google Office, which homes hundreds of toys and gadgets for relaxation, you could also choose gadgets for home use. However, if your office has a formal setting, look for gifts that are appropriate for the business needs, like a portable presentation system or a heavy-duty hard drive.</p>
<p>Gadgets that are perfect for travel include spacious hard drivers, portable DVD players, portable PlayStation, the latest mobile phone and the all-time favorite mp3 players.</p>
<p>Regardless of what gift you choose, the receiver will appreciate your gift. Who wouldnâ€™t? Electronic gadgets are the trend of this generation.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most owners of mp3 players have uploaded music into their personalized gadgets from CDs, online MP3 stores or music software programs. If youâ€™re one of the million owners of an mp3 player, you may have heard of the useful gadget called the mp3 transmitter. </p>
<p>An mp3 transmitter allows the user to hook up your mp3s into your computer or home entertainment system to maximize your listening enjoyment. Therefore, whether you wish to host a party on your patio and having problems on where you should set up your sounds system or want to enjoy your mp3s in the living room, the mp3 transmitter can solve your problem.</p>
<p>While some manufacturers design simple mp3 transmitters for daily use, other brands offer wireless mp3 transmitters that offers the same benefits, but adding comfort and ease for special uses.<br />
Understanding how wireless MP3 transmitters work<br />
Wireless technology on mp3 transmitters follows a basic concept and is very easy to install. Each computer has an audio card output located at the rear of your personal computer. You have to plug the wireless mp3 transmitter into the audio output and plug the power supply to turn it on or off. Once the cables are in its place, you have to place the mp3 transmitterâ€™s antenna into an upward arrangement.<br />
In conjunction with an mp3 receiver, setting up your sound system anywhere in the house is now an easy task. Just turn on your computer, plug in the mp3 transmitter as well as the receiver, determine the mp3 library you wish to play and you are now wirelessly broadcasting the music to the other room from your computer. With this 30-minute sound system set-up, who says hosting a part is hard?<br />
A great feature of most wireless mp3 transmitters is that it can be turned on or off, instead of continuous on. Some equipment may receive interference when the receiver is placed above the stereo or the mp3 transmitter itself is next to any electrical gadgets. For this reason, many experts suggest that if you experience interference from your music enjoyment, simply change the positions of your receiver or mp3 transmitter.<br />
For an easy-to-use and simple to install piece of equipment that transmits your downloaded mp3s to greater audiences, these mp3 transmitters are available in the market for as low as Rs 2800 at <a href="http://gadgets.in">Gadgets.in</a></p>
