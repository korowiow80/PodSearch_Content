But what if you could turn evaluations into a tool that would unleash the power of performance in your company? What if your performance management system could ignite employee engagement, help develop your high potential employees, and create a true pay-for-performance culture? In this episode, guests Paul Falcone and Winston Tan tell us how to create a “real” performance management system. We’ll talk about some common obstacles in implementing a true pay-for-performance culture, the importance of looking at both the individual performance assessments and the enterprise scorecard, goal-setting at the individual and enterprise level, and how a real performance management system can unleash the power of your company’s performance.</span>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to an April 20th opinion by the EEOC, an employer who discriminates against an applicant or employee on the basis of gender identity is violating the sex discrimination prohibition of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</p>
<p>On Monday, April 23, the EEOC announced its unanimous ruling in the case of Mia Macy, a transgender woman who was allegedly denied a job as a ballistics technician at the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ Walnut Creek, California laboratory. In the ruling, the Commission stated:</p>
<p><em>“[W]e conclude that intentional discrimination against a transgender individual because the person is transgender is, by definition, discrimination ‘based on… sex,’ and such discrimination therefore violates Title VII.”</em></p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about the EEOC’s historic decision, what it could mean for the future of transgender discrimination cases, pending legislation relating to LGBT discrimination, and what employers should do now to ensure their workplaces are free from LGBT discrimination.

<p>Considered to be the largest of its kind against a state civil service system, the lawsuit claimed that since 2003 as many as 6,000 African American individuals were not hired or promoted as a result of discrimination.

		<itunes:summary>Do Americans inherently prefer whites to blacks, even if they're unaware that they do?

That's the theory of discrimination that was advanced in a lawsuit claiming the Iowa state government discriminated against black job applicants and employees in hiring and promotion decisions.

Considered to be the largest of its kind against a state civil service system, the lawsuit claimed that since 2003 as many as 6,000 African American individuals were not hired or promoted as a result of discrimination. The plaintiffs were seeking millions in lost wages, as well as court-ordered changes to Iowa state's hiring and promotion practices.

On Tuesday, April 17, 2012, District Judge Robert Blink said that plaintiffs failed to prove their "unique legal theory." Thomas Newkirk, lead plaintiffs' attorney, promised to appeal the decision.

The "implicit bias" theory of discrimination is gaining interest among employment attorneys, and we may see more of these kinds of cases in the future.

In this installment, we talk about this new theory of discrimination, how it relates to conventional theories, the class-action lawsuit that claimed implicit bias, and what the judge had to say on the issue.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is dinnertime like at your house? Are you running one way while your kids are running the other way and your spouse is still at work? Are you emailing and texting at the table? Do you even make it home for dinner? If Facebook&#8217;s COO Sheryl Sandberg can do it, you can do it too.</p>
<p>New research confirms what some of us have known for a long time - children who have dinner with their parents are healthier, happier and better students. Robin Fox, an anthropology professor at Rutgers, says &#8220;if it were just about food, we would squirt it into their mouths with a tube. A meal is about civilizing children. It&#8217;s about teaching them to be a member of their culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>So how does Sheryl Sandberg manage to get home to civilize her children during dinner? She&#8217;s re-defined what the workday means.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just when you thought you had the employment law landscape figured out, along comes pending legislation that could change everything. From age discrimination claims to workplace flexibility to unionization and labor organizing, new bills in the House and Senate may change the way you run your business.</p>
<p>Senator Tom Harkin introduced the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, a bill that would overturn the U.S. Supreme Court&#8217;s decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., and lower the burden of proof for employees to prove age discrimination.</p>
<p>Senator Jim DeMint introduced the National Right To Work Act to &#8220;preserve and protect the free choice of individual employees to form, join, or assist labor organizations, or to refrain from such activities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Representative Sandy Adams introduced the Keep Employees&#8217; Emails and Phones Secure Act, a bill that would prohibit the NLRB from requiring employers to provide phone numbers and email addresses of employees to the Board or to a labor organziation.</p>
<p>Representative Carolyn Maloney and Senator Robert Casey introduced the Working Families Flexibility Act. This bill would create a statutory right for employees to request flexible work terms and conditions.</p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about this pending legislation employers can&#8217;t afford to ignore with guest Eric Meyer. Mr. Meyer is a partner in the Philadelphia office of Dilworth Paxson. He focuses his practice on employment discrimination and retaliation, workplace harassment, pay practices, leaves of absence, disabilities and reasonable accommodations, non-competition and trade secrets disputes, employment contracts, reductions in force, severance agreements and union-management relations.

<p>Since 1965, the EEOC has served as the nation&#8217;s lead enforcer of employment anti-discrimination laws and chief promoter of equal employment opportunity. The Agency recently released its Fiscal Year 2012 to 2016 Strategic Plan. The Strategic Plan establishes a framework for achieving the EEOC&#8217;s mission to stop and remedy unlawful employment discrimination so that the Commission&#8217;s vision of justice and equality in the workplace can be realized.</p>
<p>The Strategic Plan lays out three objectives:to combat employment discrimination through strategic law enforcement, to prevent employment discrimination through education and outreach, and to deliver excellent services through effective systems, updated technology, and a skilled and diverse workforce.</p>
<p>In this installment, we&#8217;re joined by EEOC Commissioner Chai Feldblum. She shares information about the Agency&#8217;s outreach and education programs aimed at assisting the employer community with EEO compliance. We also discuss how the EEOC plans to incorporate more elements of social media in these programs, the importance of preventing employment discrimination, and why proactive EEO compliance should be a priority for every employer.</p>
<p>You can contact Commissioner Feldblum via email at <a href="mailto:chai.feldblum@eeoc.gov">chai.feldblum@eeoc.gov</a> or follow her on Twitter at @chaifeldblum.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of discussion recently about contraception, spurred by the Obama administration&#8217;s rule requiring most employers to provide prescription contraceptive coverage to their employees without additional cost.</p>
<p>The contraceptive coverage issue is interesting from several different perspectives. Rush Limbaugh and others have commented on the moral issues, religious arguments have been advanced, and Tim Worstall over at Forbes has raised a question about whether contraception is amenable to insurance as its financing method.</p>
<p>But what many people don&#8217;t know is that employers have been required to provide contraceptive coverage under their health plans for years. Back in 2000, the EEOC issued a ruling that an employer&#8217;s failure to provide contraceptive coverage as part of employer-sponsored health plans providing coverage of other presacription drugs and preventative services was a violation of the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act. This act was an amendment to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act which outlaws (among other things) gender discrimination.</p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about what employers need to know about contraceptive coverage. We discuss the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, the EEOC&#8217;s ruling more than a decade ago, the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling on the issue regarding religious organizations, and other state and federal rulings on contraceptive coverage.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Employee departures are a fact of life in business. Whether voluntary of involuntary, it can sometimes be a difficult process. There are a variety of issues to consider - how will you keep your confidential information confidential? If you have a non-compete agreement, is it enforceable? What happens to the departing employee&#8217;s social media profile and contacts? Do you need anti-raid provisions built in to your employment agreements?</p>
<p>You can help make employee departures as smooth as possible - and protect the interests of everyone involved - by arming yourself with some basic information and by following a few basic rules.</p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about employee departures and associated issues such as non-compete and non-solicitation agreements, garden leave policies and how social media factors in to employee departures with guest Rob Radcliff.</p>
<p>Rob is an attorney in the Dallas, Texas office of Langley Weinstein. He represents businesses and individuals throughout the state of Texas from trial through appeal. Rob focuses his practice on employment and commercial matters including issues arising from the arrival and departure of employees. He is the author of the blog Smooth Transitions, and writes about the legal issues arising from the departure of employees and business breakups.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On February 15, the EEOC held a public meeting on pregnancy discrimination and caregiver issues. Invited panelists told the EEOC that discrimination against pregnant women and employees with caregiving responsibilities remains a significant problem in today&#8217;s workforce.</p>
<p>While the problem affects all segments of the workforce, low-wage workers are particularly affected. As noted by Maryann Parker, Associate General Counsel of the Service Employees International Union, the shift from manufacturing to service sector jobs has contributed to the problem. Low-wage jobs in the service sector often come with either very rigid work schedules with no flexibility or completely unpredictable schedules with no fixed hours from week to week. Both situations can pose significant difficulty for employees with caregiving responsibilities.</p>
<p>In this installment, we discuss the issues raised during the meeting surrounding pregnancy discrimination and discrimination against men and women with caregiving responsibilities. We also talk about what steps employers can take to comply with the law and implement best practices for the work-life balance.

The Department of Labor announced its &#8220;Equal Pay App Challenge, and last week there was new compensation-related legislation introduced in Congress.</p>
<p>Representative Gregory Meeks (D-NY) introduced a bill that would require companies to include information on the composition of women and minorities in their annual 10-K report to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Specifically, the bill would require employers to report compensation information for all employees and create five brackets of compensation - ranging from the lowest 20 percent to the highest 20 percent - and report the number of women and minorities in each bracket.</p>
<p>In this installment, we discuss some of the ways in which the Department of Labor and Congress are attempting to understand the gender wage gap.

Do you tailor the message to the specific audience you&#8217;re communicating with, or do you deliver the same words in the same way to the C-Suite, supervisors and managers and the hourly staff?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Modifying the way you communicate can have a big impact. The good news is that our guest thinks HR gets conversations right about 80% of the time - but there&#8217;s always room for some improvement. In this installment, we&#8217;re joined by someone who&#8217;s really great at conversations - William Tincup.</div>
<div></div>
<div>William describes himself as “strange” because he excels at marketing, sales and HR. He’s one of the leading thinkers on social media application for human resources, an expert on adoption of HR technology, and knows a thing or two about marketing. William runs Tincup &amp; Co., a company that serves as a sounding board for human resources practitioners and HR vendors. He’s been blogging on HR issues since 2007, and contributes to Fistful of Talent, TalentCulture, and HRExaminer. William also co-hosts DriveThruHR, a daily podcast focusing on HR issues and HR practitioners. He’s great at conversations, and it’s truly a pleasure to have him with us on the podcast.</div>

		<itunes:summary>The OFCCP is proposing to revise the regulations of Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act. Section 503 prohibits federal contractors and subcontractors from discriminating on the basis of disability, and requires affirmative action on behalf of qualified individuals with disabilities.
The proposed regulations outline the specific actions a contractor must take regarding recruiting, training, record-keeping and policy dissemination. Under the proposed regulations, contractors would be required to develop and maintain specific data sets relating to individuals with disabilities. Finally, the proposed regulations establish a utilization goal for individuals with disabilities.
According to Secretary of Labor Hilda Solia, "this proposed rule represents one of the most significant advances in protecting the civil rights of workers with disabilities since the passable of the Americans with Disabilities Act."

<p>Misclassification. It&#8217;s a subject we&#8217;ve discussed before, and it&#8217;s still one of the biggest hotspots for litigation and regulatory investigation. The Department of Labor has launched a Misclassification Initiative and is currently working on signing a Memorandum of Understanding with the IRS. Under this agreement, the agencies would work together and share information to reduce misclassification of employees, reduce the tax gap, and  to improve compliance with federal labor laws.</p>
<p>But the two agencies seem to be taking different approaches to remedying misclassification. The IRS is offering a new Voluntary Classification Settlement Program. The program would allow those employers who are concerned that they have misclassified employees in the past to voluntarily come forward, rather than waiting for an IRS examination. The Department of Labor, however, is not offering a similar program. Many employers may be interested in taking advantage of the IRS amnesty program, but worry about what will happen on the Department of Labor&#8217;s end if they do.</p>
<p>In this installment, we&#8217;ll be talking about the IRS misclassification settlement program with Jennifer Neumann and Tamar Dolcourt. Ms. Neumann and Ms. Dolcourt are members of Foley and Lardner&#8217;s Labor and Employment Practices Group.</p></div>

<p>As we approach the end of the year, employers will be confronted with this question as they recognize Hanukkah, Christmas, New Year&#8217;s Day or even a temporary shutdown during the last week of the year.</p>
<p>Accounting for holidays or temporary shutdowns when calculating FMLA leave can be tricky business. With all of the other year-end tasks you&#8217;ve been assigned, it may seem like one more compliance issue for you to struggle with when you&#8217;re already swamped with other things.</p>
<p>The good news is that calculating FMLA leave around holiday time doesn&#8217;t have to be a struggle. There are some simple tips that can help you calculate FMLA leave correctly and confidently.</p>
<p>In this installment, we speak with Jeffrey Nowak, co-chair of Franczek Radelet&#8217;s Labor and Employment Practice. Jeff has extensive experience with the Family and Medical Leave Act, and has counseled clients on compliance with FMLA regulations, conducting FMLA audits and training, and successfully litigating FMLA lawsuits. Jeff will talk about the basics of FMLA leave, and give us some suggestions to take the guesswork out of accounting for holidays when calculating FMLA leave.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) permits individuals to bring claims of disparate impact. An employer may be found liable for discrimination based on its use of policies and practices that appear to be neutral but have a disproportionate adverse effect on a protected class. These kinds of claims are often triggered by reductions in force.</p>
<p>One of the defenses to a disparate impact claim filed under the ADEA is the “reasonable factor other than age” defense (RFOA). If a selection process has a disparate impact based on age, the employer must show that the process chosen and the business decisions made were reasonable.</p>
<p>In February of 2010, the EEOC proposed a redefinition of the RFOA defense to include a set of criteria for establishing the “reasonable factor other than age”. In May of 2010, EEOC Chair Jacqueline A. Berrien testified before a U.S. Senate Committee that the proposed amendments were needed to counteract “a recent spate of case law restricting the rights of age discrimination plaintiffs.”</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the EEOC voted 3-2 in favor of a draft final rule defining the parameters of the RFOA defense. The rule will now be sent to the Office of Management and Budget for review, and upon approval, published in the Federal Register as a final rule. The general consensus is that the new rule may make it more difficult for an employer to assert an affirmative defense in response to a disparate impact claim filed under ADEA.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent months, the EEOC has been focusing on barriers to employment. The latest commission meeting focused on how to effectively eliminate barriers to employment for veterans with disabilities.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Labor, Office of Personnel Management, Department of Defense and private sector stakeholders testified that veterans with disabilities have unique needs in transitioning to civilian employment, and retaining that employment. Several panelists noted the important role employment plays in easing a veteran’s return to civilian life and recovery from injuries. Ruth Fanning, Director of Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Services for the VA, stressed the need for early intervention in the transition from active duty to civilian life.  Encouraging injured veterans to plan and work toward civilian career goals “reduces the risk of homelessness, underemployment, or unsuitable employment after discharge from the military.” As George M. Parker, Director of Compliance and Investigations of the Veterans Employment and Training Service (VETS) of the DOL put it, “for wounded and injured veterans, employment can play a significant role in the road to recovery.”</p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about the issues raised during the meeting and highlight some of the ways that barriers to employment for veterans with disabilities can be removed.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those of us working in EEO compliance, human resources and employment law, we may not feel like there&#8217;s much to be thankful for lately. Pending changes in the laws, aggressive enforcement strategies by the regulatory agencies, and continued exposure to employment related litigation are going to make our jobs more difficult in the coming months. But there are some good things that have happened, and a lot of positive things on the horizon.</p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about some things to be thankful for when it comes to human resources and employment law. We talk about social media, workplace flexibility and the advancements we&#8217;ve made in civil rights for all members of the labor force. We discuss the importance of acknowledging the small accomplishments that happen every day, and give thanks for some resources that make it easier to stay in compliance with EEO regulations and employment law.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s a war on wage theft. The Wage and Hour Division currently has more than 1,000 investigators, an increase of  40% since 2008. According to Nancy Leppink, Deputy Wage and Hour Administrator, WHD will never have enough resources to address every complaint it receives or to investigate every employer who may not be complying with the law. Because of this, WHD is focusing its resources on industries with a prevalence of low wage and vulnerable workers, and targeting industries that have significant levels of non-compliance. Ms. Leppink believes that using directed enforcement initiatives, instead of relying heavily on the individual complaints the agency receives, is a more efficient use of resources that has a greater impact on compliance – both in the targeted industries and overall.</p>
<p>But is the enforcement path WHD has chosen optimal? Some think that this path restricts flexible employment opportunities, fails to provide for the most positive outcome for employers and employees, and focuses primarily on punishing employers. Others think that WHD’s shift in regulatory and enforcement tactics have made complying with the Fair Labor Standards Act increasingly difficult for employers. They argue that by focusing resources on extensive and often unnecessary enforcement actions, WHD is failing to help good faith employers comply with the law.</p>
<p>In this installment of The Proactive Employer Podcast, we talk about the war on wage theft and WHD. We recap the recent changes to the Agency’s enforcement strategy and talk about the increasing focus on employee misclassification and targeting of specific industries. We also discuss what good – and harm – the new enforcement strategy may be creating.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to an article appearing in CNN this week, some experts say yes, they are.</p>
<p>Sexual harassment in the workplace is in the spotlight once again thanks to Republican Presidential Contender Herman Cain. Mr. Cain has recently been addressing allegations of inappropriate conduct. The allegations come from two women who are former employees of the National Restaurant Association. Mr Cain led the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Mr. Cain claims he was falsely accused, and that a thorough investigation found that the allegations were baseless; he did acknowledge that a confidential settlement was reached.</p>
<p>Confidential settlements in sexual harassment claims is a common practice. According to attorney Gloria Allred, confidential settlements are extremely common and many of them are done prior to any lawsuit being filed. According to Ms. Allred, the purpose is to avoid litigation and &#8220;keep it confidential, because once it&#8217;s filed it becomes public record.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this installment, we&#8217;ll be talking about what constitutes sexual harassment, some suggestions on sexual harassment prevention, and common ways to investigate sexual harassment allegations. We&#8217;ll conclude with a discussion of sexual harassment settlements, and whether they truly are part of the cost of doing business.

<p>Baby Boomers, Gen Xers, Millennials&#8230; does it <em>really</em> make a difference in the workplace?</p>
<p>It seems like we&#8217;ve been talking about this question for ages, and everyone has an opinion. While there are some common themes that transcend generation (e.g., everyone wants leaders who are credible, trust in the workplace is important, etc.), there are substantial differences between generations when it comes to core values, the perception of work, and what each group values most.</p>
<p>These differences in the perception of work and rewards, in turn, has implications for your total rewards strategy.</p>
<p>In this installment, we&#8217;ll be talking about these differences in the perception of work and rewards, and what those differences mean for base salaries, pay increases, incentives and benefits.</p></div>

<p>Whenever we make a comparison among employees - for Affirmative Action Plans, in the context of litigation, for internal analysis, or just making selection decisions - it&#8217;s important that to get the groupings right.</p>
<p>Typically, similarly situated employee groupings (aka SSEGs) are constructed for comparing employees. But what does &#8220;similarly situated&#8221; really mean? What characteristics should be considered when building these groupings? How do we know if one employee really is a comparator for another employee?</p>
<p>Getting the right groupings of employees is essential. Not only do our groupings memorialize our view of our workforce, how we group employees can have a dramatic effect on the outcomes of our comparisons. Improperly grouped employees can render a comparison among those employees meaningless.</p>
<p>There is no magic bullet for defining comparators and constructing SSEGs - a rigid formula simply does not exist. In some respects, it&#8217;s an art form. But there are a few rules of thumb, and several factors that should be considered.</p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about what makes a good comparator and discuss the rules of thumb for constructing similarly situated employee groupings.</p></div>

		<itunes:summary>We've gotten used to seeing some big numbers in EEOC litigation. But the latest big number - $2.6 million in attorneys' fees, costs and expenses - comes with a twist. This time, it will be coming out of the EEOC's pocket.

A Michigan federal judge took the EEOC to task for its "reckless sue first, ask questions later strategy." The Court's opinion made reference to the EEOC's failure to investigate before filing suit, failure to engage in conciliation efforts before filing suit, and generally making things difficult for Cintas Corporation for more than 11 years.

In this installment, we talk about this landmark decision, what it means for employers, and how it might affect future EEOC investigations.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In last week’s installment of The Proactive Employer, we discussed planning for a reduction in force and the importance of examining your initial selections for adverse impact. As a follow-up to our termination theme, this week we’ll be discussing economic damages in wrongful termination litigation.</p>
<p>When evaluating the economic damages in wrongful termination litigation, the central question being addressed consists of two components: (1) what is the likely compensation that the individual would have earned but for the alleged wrongful termination, and (2) what is the likely compensation that the individual can be expected to earn from alternate employment given the alleged wrongful termination.</p>
<p>In this installment, we’ll discuss wrongful termination and the factors that go into a calculation of damages resulting from wrongful termination. We’ll talk about the importance of mitigation and the kinds of information about job search and alternate employment that go into the damages calculations.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media has evolved into a mainstream way of communication. From blogging and Tweeting,  to Flickr and Facebook,  to Yelp and YouTube,  social media has exploded. This explosion has created some horror stories causing careers to implode:  the secret blogging of Whole Foods CEO John Mackey,  a woman’s Facebook rant on why she wanted to be fired,  and the recent Twitter scandal involving former Representative Anthony Weiner. The social media explosion has also created a few firestorms for companies. Remember the YouTube video of the rats running through a fast food restaurant in New York City? Or how about the Chrysler employee who dropped an F bomb in the corporate Twitter stream?</p>
<p>Like it or not,  social media is something employers have to deal with. But it raises a lot of questions – should we have a formal policy? What should it say? Are there privacy concerns? How to we ensure that our trade secrets stay secret? What if we’re involved in litigation – what’s discoverable and what’s not? It seems like the questions are never-ending.</p>
<p><img title="clkdl_bookshot.gif" src="http://theproactiveemployer.podbean.com/mf/web/k6nx72/clkdl_bookshot.gif" border="0" alt="clkdl_bookshot.gif" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="left" />The good news is that there&#8217;s a new resource available to help answer these questions. Jon Hyman&#8217;s new book, <em><a href="http://www.thompson.com/public/offerpage.jsp?prod=CLKDL" target="_blank">Think Before You Click: Strategies for Managing Social Media in the Workplace</a>,  </em>assembles an all-star lineup of labor and employment lawyers, bloggers and social media adopters discussing nearly every aspect of social media - from hiring and recruiting,  privacy,  confidentiality and non-competition agreements to social media policies,  discovery and litigation.</p>
<p>The Proactive Employer Podcast has lined up all seven of these experts for a special two-part round table discussion on what you need to know about social media. Jonathan Hyman  (<a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/" target="_blank">Ohio Employer&#8217;s Law Blog</a>;  <a href="http://twitter.com/jonhyman" target="_blank">@jonhyman</a>) of Kohrman Jackson and Krantz will be providing suggestions on how to implement and enforce an effective and workable social media policy. Seth Borden (<a href="http://www.laborrelationstoday.com/" target="_blank">Labor Relations Today</a>;  <a href="http://twitter.com/shborden" target="_blank">@SHBorden</a>) of McKenna Long &amp; Aldridge will be discussing social media,  labor law,  and the flood of NLRB complaints we&#8217;re seen recently. Molly DiBianca  (<a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/www.delawareemploymentlawblog.com" target="_blank">Delaware Employment Law Blog</a>; <a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/goingpaperlessblog.com" target="_blank">Going Paperless</a>;  <a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/twitter.com/mollydibi" target="_blank">@MollyDiBi</a>) of Young Conaway Stargatt &amp; Taylor will provide insight into social media and privacy concerns. Eric Meyer (<a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/www.theemployerhandbook.com" target="_blank">The Employer Handbook Blog</a>;  <a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/twitter.com/eric_b_meyer" target="_blank">@Eric_B_Meyer</a>) of Dilworth Paxson will be discussing social media,  discovery and litigation. Philip Miles  (<a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/www.lawfficespace.com" target="_blank">Lawffice Space</a>;  <a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/twitter.com/philipmiles" target="_blank">@PhilipMiles</a>) of McQuaide Blasko will talk about the nuts and bolts of social media from an HR perspective. Rob Radcliff  (<a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/www.smoothtransitionslawblog.com" target="_blank">Smooth Transitions</a>;  <a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/twitter.com/robradcliff" target="_blank">@robradcliff</a>) of Langley Weinstein will provide guidance on social media,  confidentiality,  non-competition agreements,  and trade secrets. Daniel Schwartz (<a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/www.ctemploymentlawblog.com" target="_blank">Connecticut Employment Law Blog</a>;  <a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/2011/04/twitter.com/danielschwartz" target="_blank">@danielschwartz</a>) of Pullman &amp; Comley will be discussing social media,  recruiting and hiring,  and employee engagement.</p>
<p>Our experts have so much information to share, we had to divide the discussion into two parts! In Part 1, we discuss social media as a new way of communication, why employers should be concerned about social media, the continual evolution of social media and how employers can stay up-to-date, and some privacy concerns presented by social media.

		<itunes:summary>Social media has evolved into a mainstream way of communication. From blogging and Tweeting,  to Flickr and Facebook,  to Yelp and YouTube,  social media has exploded. This explosion has created some horror stories causing careers to implode:  the secret blogging of Whole Foods CEO John Mackey,  a woman’s Facebook rant on why she wanted to be fired,  and the recent Twitter scandal involving former Representative Anthony Weiner. The social media explosion has also created a few firestorms for companies. Remember the YouTube video of the rats running through a fast food restaurant in New York City? Or how about the Chrysler employee who dropped an F bomb in the corporate Twitter stream?

Like it or not,  social media is something employers have to deal with. But it raises a lot of questions – should we have a formal policy? What should it say? Are there privacy concerns? How to we ensure that our trade secrets stay secret? What if we’re involved in litigation – what’s discoverable and what’s not? It seems like the questions are never-ending.

The good news is that there's a new resource available to help answer these questions. Jon Hyman's new book, Think Before You Click: Strategies for Managing Social Media in the Workplace,  assembles an all-star lineup of labor and employment lawyers, bloggers and social media adopters discussing nearly every aspect of social media - from hiring and recruiting,  privacy,  confidentiality and non-competition agreements to social media policies,  discovery and litigation.

The Proactive Employer Podcast has lined up all seven of these experts for a special two-part round table discussion on what you need to know about social media. Jonathan Hyman  (Ohio Employer's Law Blog;  @jonhyman) of Kohrman Jackson and Krantz will be providing suggestions on how to implement and enforce an effective and workable social media policy. Seth Borden (Labor Relations Today;  @SHBorden) of McKenna Long &#x38; Aldridge will be discussing social media,  labor law,  and the flood of NLRB complaints we're seen recently. Molly DiBianca  (Delaware Employment Law Blog; Going Paperless;  @MollyDiBi) of Young Conaway Stargatt &#x38; Taylor will provide insight into social media and privacy concerns. Eric Meyer (The Employer Handbook Blog;  @Eric_B_Meyer) of Dilworth Paxson will be discussing social media,  discovery and litigation. Philip Miles  (Lawffice Space;  @PhilipMiles) of McQuaide Blasko will talk about the nuts and bolts of social media from an HR perspective. Rob Radcliff  (Smooth Transitions;  @robradcliff) of Langley Weinstein will provide guidance on social media,  confidentiality,  non-competition agreements,  and trade secrets. Daniel Schwartz (Connecticut Employment Law Blog;  @danielschwartz) of Pullman &#x38; Comley will be discussing social media,  recruiting and hiring,  and employee engagement.

Our experts have so much information to share, we had to divide the discussion into two parts! In Part 1, we discuss social media as a new way of communication, why employers should be concerned about social media, the continual evolution of social media and how employers can stay up-to-date, and some privacy concerns presented by social media</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Labor&#8217;s Spring 2011 regulatory agenda is now available. This agenda outlines all of the regulations the Agency expects to have under active consideration for promulgation, proposal or review during the next six to twelve months.</p>
<p>The regulatory agenda focuses on supporting the &#8220;Plan / Prevent / Protect&#8221; strategy to increase compliance. You&#8217;ll remember this strategy from the Spring 2010 Regulatory Narrative (here&#8217;s what we had to say last year). In short, this strategy places more emphasis on employers managing their own compliance:</p>
<p>“We are going to replace ‘catch me if you can’ with ‘Plan/Prevent/Protect’. In various ways, employers and other regulated entities will be asked to assemble plans, create processes, and designate people charged with compliance. They will be required to implement these plans and evaluate their effectiveness in achieving compliance. While the Labor Department can be flexible about which path is chosen to achieve compliance, compliance will be non-negotiable under the ‘Plan/Prevent/Protect’ system.”</p>
<p>The Department of Labor will be hosting a series of live Q&#038;A webchats during the week of July 11th:</p>
<p>Office of Labor Management Standards - Monday, July 11, 1 p.m. EDT
Occupational Safety and Health Administration - Monday, July 11, 2:30 p.m. EDT
Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs - Tuesday, July 12, 1 p.m. EDT
Wage and Hour Division - Wednesday, July 13, 1 p.m. EDT
Mine Safety and Health Administration - Thursday, July 14, 12 p.m. EDT
Employment and Training Administration - Thursday, July 14, 1:30 p.m. EDT
Employee Benefits Security Administration - Friday, July 15, 2 p.m. EDT</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s installment of The Proactive Employer podcast, we&#8217;ll be discussing the &#8220;Plan / Prevent / Protect&#8221; compliance strategy and what it means for employers, as well as highlights from the live Q&#038;A webchats.</p>
<p>The podcast will air on BlogTalkRadio at 8:30 AM this Friday and will available for on-demand listening at The Proactive Employer website and via iTunes.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Recently, the Department of Labor announced that AstraZeneca will pay $250,000 to settle allegations of gender discrimination. The dollar value of the assessment it hardly newsworthy. But the settlement decree has an interesting twist - it requires AstraZeneca to conduct a statistical analysis of base pay of sales specialists.
The required statistical analysis is the key takeaway here, and the upshot is that it&#8217;s better to examine your data before problems occur, rather than after.
In this installment, we discuss the AstraZeneca settlement decree, why the company should have been examining its compensation data in the first place, and how to go about a statistical analysis of compensation. We&#8217;ll also discuss five key points that can keep your proactive analyses confidential, protected and privileged.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Monday, June 20, the Supreme Court reversed certification in the Wal-Mart class action claim. The decision means that the gender discrimination lawsuit - involving 1.5 million female employees - included too many women who had a range of experiences that were too broad. The Supreme Court decided that the women would be better served with multiple lawsuits involving smaller groups of women. Wal-Mart may be faced with smaller class actions based on specific geographic areas (stores / districts / regions), specific job titles, discrete periods of time, and so forth.
The decision has been taking the media by storm - and has left many employers wondering what the decision really means for them.
In this installment, we talk about the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision and key arguments made by Wal-Mart and the plaintiffs that factored in to the decision. We discuss how these arguments affect your policies and procedures, and what you should be looking for when reviewing your data for equity.

In this week’s podcast installment, we’re going to conclude OFCCP month at The Proactive Employer with a discussion about the proposed changes regarding veterans.</p>
<p>On April 26th, the OFCCP published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled “Affirmative Action and Nondiscrimination Obligations of Contractors and Subcontractors Regarding Protected Veterans.” This proposed rule strengthens affirmative action obligations regarding veterans, increases data collection and production requirements for contractors, and establishes hiring benchmarks for veterans.</p>
<p>Joining us to talk about these changes is Ted Daywalt. Mr. Daywalt is President and CEO of VetJobs, the leading military job board on the Internet. Mr. Daywalt is a retired Navy Captain with 28 years of service. He is a published author and renowned speaker. He frequently speaks to businesses, government agencies and universities on topics ranging from recruiting and retention, international relations, general management, and economic trends. Mr. Daywalt is known nationwide as a veterans advocate. He regularly testifies and works with members of Congress on military, veteran, small business and employment issues. Mr. Daywalt is on the Small Business Council of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and was one of the CEOs invited to the White House Jobs Summit.

These two questions are answered by practical and statistical significance, respectively. Statistical significance has a generally accepted rule of thumb that makes it relatively easy to determine if an event is rare enough to conclude that pure chance didn&#8217;t cause it. Practical significance, on the other hand, has no generally accepted rule of thumb; practical significance is a question of judgment.

		<itunes:summary>The Four Horsemen of the Compensation Apocalypse have arrived...
(I use the term apocalypse to mean "events of great importance", not "the complete and total destruction of the world")
In the last two years, there have been four major events that have impacted the way we study compensation from an internal equity perspective:




	The Ledbetter Fair Pay Act;
	Creation of the National Equal Pay Enforcement Task Force;
	The OFCCP's proposal to rescind the Compensation Standards and Guidelines;
	The reintroduction of the Paycheck Fairness Act.

On their own, each of these events has implications for how employers make compensation decisions and how internal pay equity is examined. Together, they have the potential to revolutionize the way pay decisions are made, and may change the rules of internal pay equity forever.

In this week's installment of The Proactive Employer Podcast, we'll be discussing the Four Horsemen and what each means for employers.

The podcast will air on BlogTalkRadio at 8:30 AM this Friday and will available for on-demand listening at The Proactive Employer website and via iTunes.

<p>The Paycheck Fairness Act died in the Senate last November, but supporters promised that they would continue to work on getting this &#8220;commonsense&#8221; law passed.</p>
<p>In this installment of The Proactive Employer Podcast, we&#8217;ll be discussing the Paycheck Fairness Act and the gender pay gap.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Statistical Analysis of Adverse Impact: A Practitioner&#8217;s Guide - A New Book by Stephanie R. Thomas, Ph.D.</strong></p>
<p>Written with human resources professionals, compliance officers, and legal counsel in mind, readers are introduced to the statistical analysis of adverse impact. Various tools for examining adverse impact are presented in a non-technical manner. Simple calculations and concrete examples demonstrate how these statistical tools can be applied to questions of adverse impact in hiring, promotion, and termination decisions.</p>
<p>Traditional areas of vulnerability to adverse impact are discussed, and some emerging areas with potential for adverse impact, such as the use of social media in recruiting and employment status as a candidate screening tool, are presented. The underlying sources of vulnerability are explored and pending legislation is discussed. The importance of litigation avoidance is stressed, and suggestions for minimizing the risk of employment litigation with proactive statistical analyses are provided.</p>
<p>The goal of the book is to give human resources professionals and legal counsel a better understanding of the information their statistical consultants are providing. This leads to an improved ability to identify and correct problem areas that may exist within the organization, as well as to prevent problems from arising in the future.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has released its final regulations to implement the ADA Amendments Act (ADAAA). In this week’s installment of The Proactive Employer Podcast, we’ll be talking about the final regulations – and what they mean for employers – with Sheridan Walker. Ms. Walker is the President of HirePotential, a leading national consulting and staffing firm delivering end-to-end services to corporations, assisting them with OFCCP compliance, employment, accommodations, accessibility, recruitment and retention of the untapped workforce. She is an expert in the disability field with 25 years of broad-based experience. Ms. Walker has served on the National Disability Mentoring Day Committee for Colorado and the President’s Task Force on the Employment of People With Disabilities. We’ll be discussing how the new regulations will impact employers, emphasizing what employers need to know about accommodation and accessibility. We’ll also be talking about some societal shifts in the perception of individuals with disabilities, and talk about some practical ways employers can incorporate this largely untapped workforce into their organization.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, the largest employment discrimination class action claim to date. One of the more interesting aspects of the oral arguments, for me, was the exchange between Justice Kennedy and plaintiffs&#8217; attorney, Joseph Sellers, regarding an apparent internal contradiction in the plaintiffs&#8217; theory:</p>
<p>Q: It’s not clear to me: What is the unlawful policy that Wal-Mart has adopted, under your theory of the case?</p>
<p>A: Justice Kennedy, our theory is that Wal-Mart provided to its managers unchecked discretion in the way that this Court’s Watson decision addressed that was used to pay women less than men who were doing the same work in the same – the same facilities at the same time, even though – though those women had more seniority and higher performance, and provided fewer opportunities for promotion than women because of sex.</p>
<p>Q: It’s – it’s hard for me to see that the – your complaint faces in two directions. Number one, you said this is a culture where Arkansas knows, the headquarters knows, everything that’s going on. Then in the next breath, you say, well, now these supervisors have too much discretion. It seems to me there’s an inconsistency there, and I’m just not sure what the unlawful policy is.</p>
<p>This exchange highlights the importance of internal consistency. Whether it&#8217;s your claims in a lawsuit, your internal policies and practices, or the way in which those policies and practices are implemented, consistency is key.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s installment of The Proactive Employer, we&#8217;ll be providing a short re-cap of the oral arguments in Wal-Mart v. Dukes, highlighting the internal consistency issue. We&#8217;ll also be discussing some practical ways in which employers can ensure that their policies and practices are applied in a consistent manner.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are YOU doing to protect your organization from claims of retaliation? Are you even thinking about retaliation? You should be, because the Supreme Court of the United States is, and chances are your employees are more aware of their protections against retaliation.  In the last two months, the Supreme Court of the United States has issued three decisions relating to retaliation claims. </p>
<p>On January 24th, the Supreme Court ruled in Thompson v. North American Stainless that anyone within the “zone of interests” may have a claim of retaliation, even if they did not participate in the original complaint of discrimination. This decision effectively permits third-party claims of retaliation.</p>
<p>About a month later, on March 1st, the Supreme Court of the United States issued a decision that allows employers to be liable for discrimination based on the bias of an employee’s supervisors. The decision in Staub v. Proctor Hospital, is being described by many as the most important employment law decision of the last decade.</p>
<p>And now, three weeks after the Staub v. Proctor Hospital decision, the Supreme Court has issued yet another decision relating to retaliation. The decision, in Kasten v. St. Gobain Performance Plastics Corporation, holds that the anti-retaliation provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act protect an employee’s oral complaints about wage and hour violations. </p>
<p>In this installment, we&#8217;ll be discussing the implications of these decisions for employers, and we&#8217;ll provide some practical suggestions on how to keep your workplace free from retaliation claims.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’re like me, you’re starting to think about spring. The crisp mornings and afternoon sunshine – and of course the daffodils – mean that spring is right around the corner. Part of thinking about spring means thinking about spring cleaning – opening the windows to the fresh spring air, getting rid of accumulated things during the winter months, planning for home improvement projects and landscaping, and making sure everything is is order.</p>
<p>Spring cleaning your business is just as important, and if you follow a few simple steps, can be just as refreshing. In this installment of The Proactive Employer podcast, we’ll be talking about some ways you can refresh your workplace by revisiting your compliance policies and implementing proactive analyses to ensure that you’re on the right track.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On March 1st, the Supreme Court of the United States made a decision that allows employers to be liable for discrimination based on the bias of an employee’s supervisors, even though the supervisors did not make the actual decision to terminate the employee. The decision in Staub v. Proctor Hospital, is being described by many as the most important employment law decision of the last decade.</p>
<p>Joining us today to talk about this decision, and what it means for employers, is Timothy Eavenson. Mr. Eavenson is an attorney in the Labor and Employment Practice Group of SmithAmundsen.  He regularly counsels employers on discrimination, wage and hour, and other HR-related issues, and he represents businesses in employment disputes throughout the country. Mr. Eavensen is also the author of the blog, Current Employment, where he writes about issues relating to the workplace and the law.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you ready for a desk audit? The OFCCP’s Active Case Management (ACM) was replaced by Active Case Enforcement on January 1. There are five main differences between ACM and ACE:
(1) Compliance evaluation – under ACM, the compliance review method was used. Under ACE, all compliance evaluation methodologies – including the compliance check – will be used;
(2) Size of protected group – ACM focused on cases of systemic discrimination where there were ten or more affected class members. ACE does not have a minimum number of affected class members;
(3) Desk audits – under ACM, desk audits were performed only when there was an indication of discrimination, or alternatively, in every 25th review. Under ACE, all compliance evaluations will begin with a full desk audit;
(4) Evidence of discrimination – anecdotal and statistical evidence were considered under ACM. ACE considers anecdotal and statistical evidence, but also looks at patterns of individual discrimination, technical violations (for example, recordkeeping and records retention) and failure to comply with other laws;
(5) Onsite reviews – Under ACM, onsite reviews were limited to the indicators triggering the review. Under ACE, onsite reviews will be comprehensive and not limited in scope.
In this week’s installment of The Proactive Employer podcast, we’ll be discussing the differences between Active Case Management and Active Case Enforcement in more detail, and talk about what this change means for employers.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last week, the EEOC held a hearing to examine the impact of only considering employed applicants for job vacancies. EEOC Chair Jacqueline Berrien stated:</p>
<p>“Throughout its 45 year history, the EEOC has identified and remedied discrimination in hiring and remains committed to ensuring job applicants are treated fairly. [The] meeting gave the Commission an important opportunity to learn about the emerging practice of excluding unemployed persons from applicant pools.”</p>
<p>Several experts testified during the hearing, including:</p>
<p>Helen Norton, Associate Professor at the University of Colorado School of Law;
Fatima Goss Graves, Vice President for Education and Employment of the National Women’s Law Center;
Algernon Austin, Director of the Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy of the Economic Policy Institute;
Dr. William Spriggs, Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy;
Christine Owens, Executive Director of the National Employment Law Project;
James Urban,  partner at Jones Day;
Fernan Cepero, representing the Society of Human Resource Professionals.</p>
<p>In this installment of The Proactive Employer Podcast, we provide some highlights of the testimony given at the meeting, and talk about how limiting the candidate pool to employed individuals may have a disparate impact on racial minorities and individuals with disabilities. We also discuss some of the key issues employers are attempting to address by using employment status, and provide some suggestions on alternative screening criteria to address those key issues.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are two main legal theories of discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate impact. Disparate treatment is what we typically think of when we think about discrimination. Disparate treatment occurs when a decision-maker intentionally treats members of one group differently than members of another group. Disparate impact, on the other hand, focuses not on the intent of the decision-makers, but the criteria they use. In a disparate impact claim, the intent of the decision-maker is irrelevant. Disparate impact exists when a facially-neutral policy or practice has different effects on different groups. It’s important to note that disparate impact is not in-and-of itself illegal. Under the Civil Rights Act, disparate impact is prohibited only if the employer cannot demonstrate that the employment practice creating the adverse impact is job related and consistent with business necessity.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s installment of The Proactive Employer Podcast, we&#8217;ll be discussing how to examine questions of disparate impact. We&#8217;ll talk about how the questions are typically framed, the kinds of data and documentation needed for an analysis, and factors to consider when constructing the study population.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Retaliation claims are the leading type of claim filed with the EEOC. For the second year in a row, more employees complained about retaliation than any particular form of discrimination. The 36,258 retaliation complaints filed during 2010 represent an 8% increase from 2008, and a 61% increase from 2006. Some experts are predicting even more retaliation claims will be filed as a result of the Supreme Court’s decision last week in Thompson v. American Stainless. This decision could broaden the scope of individuals who may be able to raise a claim of retaliation. Anyone within what the Supreme Court referred to as the “zone of interests” may now have a claim of retaliation, even if they didn’t participate in the original complaint of discrimination.</p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about this Supreme Court decision and what it means for employers with Philip Miles. Mr. Miles is an attorney at McQuaide Blasko in State College, Pennsylvania.  His practice areas include labor and employment law and general civil litigation. Mr. Miles is the author of the blog Lawffice Space, and has been quoted in Business Insurance and has had feature articles published in ABA Law Practice Today, and the Pennsylvania Bar Association Civil Litigation Update.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This Friday, January 28th, is The Proactive Employer&#8217;s first anniversary! The podcast was launched on January 29, 2010. Since then, we’ve done  our best to bring you the compliance and employment litigation risk  management information you need in a format you can use. We’ve covered a  wide array of topics, from Affirmative Action Plans to zoning issues  for telecommuting employees.</p>
<p>To celebrate our anniversary, we have a great installment lined up that exemplifies the podcast. <a href="http://www.ohioemployerlawblog.com/" target="_blank">Jonathan Hyman</a> will be joining us to talk about ten issues of importance to every employer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Documentation and document retention;</li>
<li>Applications, background checks and new hires;</li>
<li>Confidentiality;</li>
<li>Technology;</li>
<li>EEO: discrimination, harassment, and retaliation;</li>
<li>Wage and hour issues;</li>
<li>FMLA and benefits;</li>
<li>Immigration;</li>
<li>Health, safety, and security;</li>
<li>Evaluation, discipline, and termination.</li>

		<itunes:summary>This Friday, January 28th, is The Proactive Employer's first anniversary! The podcast was launched on January 29, 2010. Since then, we’ve done  our best to bring you the compliance and employment litigation risk  management information you need in a format you can use. We’ve covered a  wide array of topics, from Affirmative Action Plans to zoning issues  for telecommuting employees.

To celebrate our anniversary, we have a great installment lined up that exemplifies the podcast. Jonathan Hyman will be joining us to talk about ten issues of importance to every employer:

	Documentation and document retention;
	Applications, background checks and new hires;
	Confidentiality;
	Technology;
	EEO: discrimination, harassment, and retaliation;
	Wage and hour issues;
	FMLA and benefits;
	Immigration;
	Health, safety, and security;
	Evaluation, discipline, and termination.

Mr. Hyman will be giving us some suggestions on best practices and on identifying potential problem areas.

These ten issues are drawn from Mr. Hyman's proprietary 200-point audit of  human resources and employment policies and practices. For listeners who  are interested in discovering which areas of their business are out of  compliance and open to legal risk, Mr. Hyman is willing to conduct this  preliminary audit without charge</itunes:summary>

Since then, the OFCCP has been relatively silent on the pending rescission - that is, until last week.</p>
<p>On Monday, a Federal Register Notice provided some additional detail into the underlying reason for the rescission. The OFCCP stated that the Standards have limited their ability to effectively investigate, analyze and identify compensation discrimination. The OFCCP believes that the current Standards, which are based on multiple regression analysis, are too rigid. The Agency is planning to &#8220;re-institute flexibility in its use of investigative approaches and tools.&#8221;</p>
<p>With respect to the Guidelines, the OFCCP proposes to disseminate guidance via webinars, the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section of its website, etc., rather than through the issuance of a Federal Register notice.</p>
<p>In this week&#8217;s installment of The Proactive Employer Podcast,we&#8217;ll be discuss the reasons for the proposed rescission, possible replacement analysis methods, how the rescission might affect the contractor community with respect to the audit process and the findings of discrimination, and what employers should do now to prepare.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the wake of the recent financial crisis, Congress has passed the Frank-Dodd Financial Reform Act. The Act focuses on oversight, and establishes some new committees and councils, such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Financial Services Oversight Council has also been created to serve as an early warning detection system for storms brewing in the markets.</p>
<p>But there is an aspect of the Act that has largely been overlooked. It mandates that every federal finance agency must establish an Office of Minority and Women Inclusion. According to the Act, the goal is to “ensure equal employment opportunity and racial, ethnic and gender diversity.” At least twenty federal agencies are expected to be affected by this, including the Federal Reserve. Existing offices or diversity programs must be replaced by January 20, 2011. Many think that this measure will eventually extend to private financial institutions.</p>
<p>Given the increased scrutiny placed on the financial services sector lately, employers in this space cannot afford to ignore the risk of employment practices litigation. In this installment of The Proactive Employer podcast, we’ll be discussing the implications of the Frank-Dodd Financial Reform Act for private financial institutions, and provide some suggestions on managing the risk of employment discrimination claims.

Many employers are offering their employees the opportunity to work remotely. And the federal government is one of those employers.</p>
<p>Last week, President Obama signed the Telework Enhancement Act into law. The law requires all federal agencies to establish telework policies within six months. According to information from the Office of Personnel Management, approxmately 1.2 million federal employees could be eligible for telework by June 2011. Under the Telework Enhancement Act, federal agencies are required to determine telework eligibility for their staff and notify all workers who are eligible to telework under the new policies. Additionally, each agency must establish a telework managing officer who reports directly to the agency&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>Many private sector employers have been offering teleworking opportunities for their employees for years. And now that the federal government is offering a telework option, some employers may be considering offering their own telecommuting program. Telecommuting can be a win-win situation for employers and employees alike. But before jumping head first into offering telecommuting, employers should be aware of some potential legal issues raised by remote working. Kristina Klein and Ashley Hager have identified ten areas to consider before taking your telecommuting program live.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social media is quickly evolving into a mainstream way of communication. As Sharlyn Lauby stated, &#8220;companies are realizing that people are talking about them whether they like it or not.&#8221; Many are responding by cultivating their own social media presence. But having a social media presence leads to a host of questions - should we have a formal policy? Who should it cover? What should it say? It seems as though there are two schools of thought when it comes to social media policies. Some organizations feel more comfortable establishing a formal policy right from the beginning. Their social media presence essentially begins with the policy. Others argue for an evolutionary approach. They see a benefit in looking at the risks and opportunities by experimenting with social media before instituting a formal policy.</p>
<p>In this installment, we talk about social media and social media policies with Dena Calo. Ms. Calo is an attorney in the Newark, New Jersey office of Genova Burns &amp; Giantomasi. She is the Director of the firm&#8217;s Human Resource Practices Group, and provides employment law counseling and training to organizations.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Managers cite performance appraisals and annual reviews as one of their most disliked tasks. Employees aren&#8217;t usually fond of them either. I&#8217;m sure that many of you have experienced being called in to your supervisor&#8217;s office for your annual review, only to hear nebulous comments about your performance that don&#8217;t really tell you anything about how you&#8217;re doing. A lot of managers are really bad at performance evaluation. But these managers are set up to fail because of deficiencies in the performance management system. A poor performance management system provides little guidance to employees on how they&#8217;re performing and fails to move the organization forward. A poor performance management system can also be a source of legal difficulties and discrimination claims.</p>
<p>In this installment, we&#8217;ll be discussing performance evaluation with Cathleen Hampton. Ms. Hampton has more than 25 years of experience in planning, developing and executing comprehensive HR strategies. Ms. Hampton is a nationally known presenter on human resources topics including HR and organizational compliance strategies, organizational and management development, performance management, HRD strategy and human capital.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An employee handbook is the most important communication tool between an employer and its workforce. It’s a statement of the policies of the business and how the business is to be conducted. A well-written handbook sets forth the expectations for employees and describes what they can expect from the employer. An employee handbook should describe the company’s legal obligations as an employer, and the employees’ rights. It’s important that the handbook is clear and as unambiguous as possible. Misunderstandings or misstatements can create legal liabilities for the employer. In legal disputes, courts have considered an employee handbook to be a contractual obligation, so it’s important to word it carefully. Today, we’ll be talking about employee handbooks with John Bagyi. Mr. Bagyi is an attorney in the Albany, New York office of Bond, Schoeneck and King. He counsels and represents employers of all types and sizes in a variety of labor and employment related context, including workplace investigations, policy development and review, wage and hour and EEO compliance, union issues, proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board, the Division of Human Rights and the EEOC, and employment litigation in federal and state courts. He also provides a broad range of employment law and human resource training to executives, managers, supervisors and employees. Mr. Bagyi has written extensively on labor and employment law and is a frequent speaker at national, state and local conferences, including the 2008 National SHRM Conference. Since 2005, he has served as General Counsel to the New York State Society for Human Resource Management.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Workplace violence is a growing concern for employers and employees nationwide. It can occur at the workplace or outside of the workplace. It can range from threats and verbal abuse to physical assaults and homicide, one of the leading causes of job-related deaths.

<p>Now more than ever, it’s essential that employers have accurate and precise records of hours worked. Today we’ll be speaking with an expert in time and attendance. Our guest is Jose Gaona, the Executive Vice President of Operations for Qqest. Mr. Gaona has extensive experience in the time and attendance space.
