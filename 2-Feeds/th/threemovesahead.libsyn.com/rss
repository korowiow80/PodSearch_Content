As Sean Vanaman mandates a Far Cry 2 episode quota, Troy and Rob begin to realize they have made a deal with a Kickstarter devil. Still, there is more that unites the podcasts the divide them.

Idle Thumbs discusses the surprising cost of running a successful Kickstarter.</p>
<p>Honestly, this is more a conversation between new partners than a proper episode. There is a lot of thinking out-loud about our intentions, rather than a cohesive topic.

            <link><![CDATA[http://threemovesahead.libsyn.com/special-announcement-three-moves-ahead-is-all-thumbs]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Rob and Troy look at the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/idlethumbs/idle-thumbs-video-game-podcast" target="_blank">Idle Thumbs Kickstarter</a> and conclude that maybe these crazy kids know what they are doing. Maybe Rob and Troy are crazy kids themselves, and maybe they have a plan so crazy it just might work. They have partnered up with <a href="http://www.idlethumbs.net/" target="_blank">Idle Thumbs</a>, finally giving Three Moves Ahead and its community the home they deserve as a part of the Idle Thumbs network.</p>
<p>You have questions, and Rob and Troy have some answers! But never forget that Three Moves Ahead remains an independent podcast. It's like it joined an awesome podcast commune led by our talented, brilliant friends. Friends who love 3MA as much as we do, and who have some great plans to help it grow. Don't forget to retweet, and ask us questions via email and Twitter. We'll do a proper introduction to the Idle Thumbs network next week!</p>]]></description>

Rob wants to know whether the iPad will ultimately move in the same complex direction as a lot of PC strategy games did, but Bruce and Julian think the iPad interface limits complexity.

Evan sees Jagged Alliance 2 as a game the defines 1990s' design, typifying the mix of ambition, quirkiness, and technical simplicity characteristic of the era's best offerings. Rob loves its portrayal of guerrilla warfare, and how Jagged Alliance was willing to punish hubris.

            <description><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.richardcobbett.com/" target="_new">Richard Cobbett</a> bravely joins Rob for a conversation with <em><a href="http://www.achrongame.com/site/" target="_new">Achron</a></em> creator Chris Hazard, despite the fact that Richard is weak as a kitten and sick as a dog. They talk about the difficulties indies face in the RTS genre, whether reviewers should make allowances for coarse but inspired games, and how Hazardous software has reacted to weak reviews. They also dig deep on <em>Achron's</em> mechanics and how they developed over the course of the project. Along the way, they prove once again that Achron is one of 2011's most fascinating RTS games.</p>
<p>This is kind of a "deep-end of the pool" discussion. You might find these resources helpful:</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Soren Johnson quits in a huff and leaves podcasting so he can try his hand at making games. But first, Soren, Rob, Julian, and Troy talk about franchises and how they develop, or don't. Rob tries to make the case for considering Paradox-developed games as a single franchise, but Troy explains why that doesn't work. Soren talks about the Civilization series, and why it has evolved the way it has. The panel considers franchise exploitation, and the Blizzard model.</p>]]></description>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Gamers With Jobs continues colonizing 3MA, but the natives still welcome Cory Banks because he brings whiskey and podcast topics. Fantasy Flight games is upset about an iOS game that bears a significant resemblance to Richard Borg's Command &amp; Colors system, and Bruce, Cory, and Rob wonder what it all means. Before they reveal themselves as ignoramuses yet again, William Flachsbart, intellectual property expert, arrives to tell them what it all means. How carefully must new products tread around the innovations of old ones? When does borrowing mechanics turn into theft? Is there any way we can send Troy to jail? What about the Vancouver Canucks?

Bruce consults von Manstein's <em>Lost Victories</em> in the hopes of discovering where they went, but Rob is pretty sure the Germans dropped them somewhere in the Pripyat Marshes. All Troy knows for sure is that 2by3 scored a big win with this game. Then Rob takes a trip into <em>Dungeons</em> and finds a pleasant surprise, while Bruce is pleased by an invasion of Poland wargame with a marvelously bad interface.</p>

Bruce consults von Manstein's Lost Victories in the hopes of discovering where they went, but Rob is pretty sure the Germans dropped them somewhere in the Pripyat Marshes. All Troy knows for sure is that 2by3 scored a big win with this game. Then Rob takes a trip into Dungeons and finds a pleasant surprise, while Bruce is pleased by an invasion of Poland wargame with a marvelously bad interface.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Troy almost fires Rob and Julian on this episode as a conversation about licensed strategy games. Bruce Geryk holds forth on why War of the Rings is like Stratomatic Baseball, Julian sings of Starfleet Battles and Rob talks about his experiences in another board game. What makes a license succeed or fail? Can either Star Wars or Star Trek really work as a licensed strategy game? Martin vs Erikson - who wins? Is Troy the only person who likes Babylon 5?<br /><br />It is a loud and fun show. Listen to it.<br /><br />Also, info on the upcoming 3MA/FOS meetup.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Troy - suffering from a splitting headache - is joined by Rob Zacny, Tom Chick (hooray) and Idle Thumbs/Gamasutra star Chris Remo before he heads off to join Irrational Games. The topic: Starcraft 2. Why does such a competitive, sports structured game like SC2 have such wide appeal? Is the single player campaign really that different from other campaigns? And how about that writing? What are the great joys and great disappointments? Finally, what does Starcraft 2 mean for the future of the PC RTS?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Oy. Troy breaks his computer and therefore sounds like he’s calling
in from a submarine. But the rest of show is a long discussion about
Games Masters experimenting with RPG and miniature mechanics. Julian
and Rob discuss a fascinating game session before the team digresses
onto iterative learning in game design and whether games do a good job
of teaching through systems at all.

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[Oy. Troy breaks his computer and therefore sounds like he’s calling
in from a submarine. But the rest of show is a long discussion about
Games Masters experimenting with RPG and miniature mechanics. Julian
and Rob discuss a fascinating game session before the team digresses
onto iterative learning in game design and whether games do a good job
of teaching through systems at all.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Troy and Tom welcome Lara Crigger, Jenn Cutter and
Tiffany Martin to the show to talk about the gender gap in strategy

discussion of the place of women in gaming, their portrayal in games,
the importance of peer groups, more <em>Brutal Legend</em> and the coming demographic shift.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A subtle shifting of the guard as Julian Murdoch is back after hiatus, but Troy Goodfellow is off for a week, leaving Julian at the mercy of the far more stable Tom Chick and Bruce Geryk.

The topic is religion: does it work in a strategy game as a mechanic? Has anyone done it better than Civ IV? Bruce argues for Dominions and random boardgames about the reformation nobody's ever heard of. Tom revisits the Sims and Europa Universalis, and Julian goes off-topic and spoils all of Assassins Creed 2 (You've been warned.)]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[This week, Tom Chick makes the case that strategy gamers need to have a
console to truly appreciate the range of games out there. He calls
Bruce and Troy “dinosaurs” for clinging bitterly to a fading gaming
platform, even though it is at the moment best suited to the deep games
that all three love. What is the present condition of strategy gaming
in the console arena? Are independent strategy game designers making a
mistake by focusing on the PC?]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>This week’s show begins with a business chat as we talk about the
changing revenue models in all gaming as downloadable content begins to
supplant or supplement the traditional retail expansion pack. Be sure
to stay tuned for Bruce’s Nietzsche moment in which he declares that
gameplay is dead.</p>

<p>The last half of the show is spent celebrating expansions that were
good, denigrating those that were bad and mourning those that never
happened. Lots of Big Huge love – kind of standard operating procedure.</p>

	<itunes:subtitle><![CDATA[The smallest podcast ever! Scheduling confusion means that just Tom
and Troy are on hand to talk about naval tactics in strategy games.
High on nostalgia, low on insight and yet another plug for Crown of Glory: Emperor’s Edition’s tactical naval engine.

You do get a moment where Tom fancies himself to be Da Vinci.

<p>Apologies for the sound quality here. In spite of a perfect sound
test earlier in the day, Mark’s satellite internet was not up to the
task later that night so he had to phone in. Then the recording somehow
made Troy’s comments appear three seconds later than they actually
happened, making editing a real pain in the ass and borking the <em>Dominions 3</em> discussion altogether. (Short version, Bruce didn’t send his turn but notice he was attacked by Julian’s deer men.)</p>
