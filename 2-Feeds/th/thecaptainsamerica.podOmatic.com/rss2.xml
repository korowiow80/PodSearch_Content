Today we start out with 'The Captain' as he interviews USCG LCDR Neil Orlich from CG Air Station Clearwater talking about getting ready for the 2012 Hurricane Season which starts June 1st. Then we speak with Arthur Hayhoe, Executive Director of the FL Coalition On Gun Rights as he argues there being NO need for the &quot;Stand Your Ground Law&quot; in FL. Immediately afterwards we speak with Don Baldauf-Our Roving Reporter who has a concealed carry permit and disputes what Mr Hayhoe had to say with facts of his own. We finish up talk with Steve Groves from the Heritage Foundation about the &quot;LOST Treaty&quot; and why America should NOT be involved in it...
