	<itunes:summary>The Gentleman&#039;s Review is a fortnightly podcast featuring Martin Wolfenden, Andrew Wilson, Tom Stringfellow and the irrepressible Lisa Goddard. It consists of lies, tall stories and a strange beery smell that simply won&#039;t go away. We&#039;ve tried rubbing the podcast with Detol but that just made everybody sound French and Tom&#039;s genitals exploded. You can get in touch with us on Twitter @thegentsreview, Facebook, by email: thechaps@thegentlemansreview.com or by voice-mail on 07092 309194.</itunes:summary>
