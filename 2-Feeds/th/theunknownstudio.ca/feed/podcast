	<itunes:summary>Every two weeks, Adam and Scott expound upon... well, whatever suits them. They feature guests from all over the place, but they tend to focus on what&#039;s going on in Edmonton, that strange, silly city/small town rooted in the middle of the Canadian Prairies. Their focus may be local, but they discuss topics from a more generalized perspective. And somehow, they also almost always wind up talking about Star Trek.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re in Edmonton and you don&#8217;t know who <a href="http://johnestacio.com/" target="_blank">John Estacio is</a>, you&#8217;re about to get an education, my friends. John is a music composer based out of Edmonton. He&#8217;s been a composer-in-residence at the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, he&#8217;s written operas and at least one movie score, and he&#8217;s a really incredibly nice, and interesting guy. His work will be performed in May at Carnegie Hall in New York, by the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra. Here&#8217;s a little bit more about John, from the bio on his website:</p>
<div class="woo-sc-quote"><p>The last decade has seen Estacio focus on operatic works. Together with librettist John Murrell, he was written three operas including Lillian Alling which premiered in October 2010 by the Vancouver Opera. Filumena, his first opera, premiered in 2003 in Calgary and Banff and went on to receive four Betty Mitchell Awards including the award for outstanding production of musical theatre work. Additional productions soon followed in Ottawa and Edmonton. Filumena was filmed for television and received its national television premiere in 2006.</p>
<p>Estacio is the recent recipient of the National Arts Centre Award for Composers which will result in three commissioned works for the National Arts Centre Orchestra in upcoming seasons. Other awards include an AMPIA Award for his film score for The Secret of the Nutcracker, and his frequent performances and broadcasts have earned him several SOCAN Concert Music Awards.</p></div>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve lived in Canada for even just a few months, you&#8217;ve probably heard someone say something like, &#8220;Canada is hockey.&#8221; And while I heartily believe that&#8217;s true, there&#8217;s something else that Canada is that I think gets overlooked by the mainstream public: Canada is videogames.</p>
<p>With over 200 game studios in the country, we&#8217;re a pretty prolific nation when it comes to producing top-notch games. Look no further than BioWare&#8217;s recent release of Mass Effect 3 for clear evidence of that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the reason Scott and I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/persepolian" target="_blank">Ramin Ostad</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/sunmattdykstra" target="_blank">Matt Dykstra</a> — two hosts from <a href="http://usercreatedcontent.ca/" target="_blank">UserCreatedContent, Edmonton&#8217;s videogame podcast</a> — to join us on this episode of the Unknown Studio to talk about the industry, trends in gaming, and the forthcoming <a href="http://www.canadianvideogameawards.com/" target="_blank">Canadian Videogame Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the show breakdown (<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/the-unknown-studio/id321077782" target="_blank">be sure and subscribe to our show on iTunes</a>):</p>
<p>0:00: Intro &#8211; &#8220;ah! ghosts!&#8221;<br />
0:50: We&#8217;re going to try to not talk about movies&#8230; oh, wait.<br />
14:55: Edmonton Story Slam Slam-off recap!<br />
27:05: Uncharted 3: Clusterfuck<br />
51:35: Elizabeth Johansson: Senate Candidate for the Evergreen Party<br />
1:04:28: A conversation with the beautiful and talented <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/shostakattack" target="_blank">Amy Shostak, artistic director for Rapid Fire Theatre</a><br />
1:14:25: Canadian Videogame Awards &#8211; too legit to quit<br />

		<itunes:summary>If you&#039;ve lived in Canada for even just a few months, you&#039;ve probably heard someone say something like, &quot;Canada is hockey.&quot; And while I heartily believe that&#039;s true, there&#039;s something else that Canada is that I think gets overlooked by the mainstream public: Canada is videogames.

With over 200 game studios in the country, we&#039;re a pretty prolific nation when it comes to producing top-notch games. Look no further than BioWare&#039;s recent release of Mass Effect 3 for clear evidence of that.

That&#039;s the reason Scott and I asked Ramin Ostad and Matt Dykstra — two hosts from UserCreatedContent, Edmonton&#039;s videogame podcast — to join us on this episode of the Unknown Studio to talk about the industry, trends in gaming, and the forthcoming Canadian Videogame Awards.

Here&#039;s the show breakdown (be sure and subscribe to our show on iTunes):

0:00: Intro - &quot;ah! ghosts!&quot;
0:50: We&#039;re going to try to not talk about movies... oh, wait.
14:55: Edmonton Story Slam Slam-off recap!
27:05: Uncharted 3: Clusterfuck
51:35: Elizabeth Johansson: Senate Candidate for the Evergreen Party
1:04:28: A conversation with the beautiful and talented Amy Shostak, artistic director for Rapid Fire Theatre
1:14:25: Canadian Videogame Awards - too legit to quit
1:24:27: The Fast 15 with Matt Dykstra
1:42:16: Denouement: Potholes

<p>Scott and I did this show solo for a few reasons — we weren&#8217;t able to secure a guest in time, and because we wanted to exercise our banter muscles, which we feel may have atrophied slightly in the last little while.

<p>But we&#8217;re all about celebrating V-Day all the same. And in order to do so, we invited <a href="http://www.twitter.com/sexagogy" target="_blank">Lauren Albrecht</a>, the voice of Sex Talk (one of our old segments) to come on the show and talk to us about her Masters research — which is all about sex toy parties.</p>
<p>Oh yes.</p>
<p>In this episode, you&#8217;ll also learn about a very cool, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MetropolisFashionFestival" target="_blank">weekend-long fashion show taking place started February 17 at Metropolis on Churchill Square</a>. You&#8217;ll also hear a rant from yours truly, and a dramatic reading from the now-fully-convalesced Scott C Bourgeois.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>From stalwart podcast contributor Jonn Kmech:</em></p>
<p>It was with a sense of child-like glee and adult-like anxiety that I waited outside the Santa workshop at Southgate Mall last week. The anxiety? Due to the very nature of being an adult male, schlepping about a Santa compound and observing children as they come out from meeting the Big Guy. If I was mall security, I probably would have asked myself what I was doing. Luckily, even after spending six hours at Southgate during the height of the Christmas shopping season, I was still only halfway to looking like the guy from One Hour Photo.</p>
<p>The glee? Due to the prospect that I was actually going to be interviewing Santa for our most recent Edmonton: A City segment. Not only that, but I would actually have a period of time to talk to him for myself, not just a couple minutes before being kicked out of there. It was a childhood dream. Even as an adult, there was something that felt undeniably fun about going to meet Santa. Maybe he&#8217;d even let me sit on his knee.</p>
<p>And, meeting Santa lived up to expectations (except for the knee-sitting thing). Carrying a brown messenger bag with him, which I will assume was where he kept the naughty/nice list, Santa descended down the walkway to greet me. We walked down the mall to the employee breakroom (where Santa hangs during his breaks), as he waved to passing adults and children, charismatically playing the crowd. It was interesting to see how many adults—approximately 0.01% of whom had anything resembling a smile on their face in the midst of Christmas shopping— lit up when they saw Santa, even as much as the kids. It was like seeing him triggered a brief reconnection with childhood memories and feelings of what Christmas is truly about.</p>
<p>I sat down and talked to Santa, a.k.a. Francis Dryden (which I can only assume is his codename), for around 40 minutes—so long that we decided to post the entire interview, for your festive seasonal enjoyment! And if you don&#8217;t listen&#8230;you&#8217;re getting a lump of coal this Christmas.</p>
<p>In it, we discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>beards (and how fake-bearded Santas are an exercise in charlatanry)</li>
<li>why some kids have difficulty seeing the economic difference between “toys” and “iPads”</li>
<li>irritating parents who complain to mall management when Santa tells those kids he can’t produce said iPads</li>
<li>the physical rigours of working 8 hours a day for a month and a half lifting 50-pound kids onto your knee</li>
<li>why he doesn’t use chimneys anymore</li>
<li>his background as a rock drummer formerly nicknamed Captain Crunch (yes, really)</li>
<li>his genuine love for children and work with the Shriners</li>
</ul>
<p>As the interview went on, it started to become more apparent that he truly sounded like the real deal; someone who went out of their way to selflessly make kids happy. If Santa is a symbol of compassion and love for children, then Mr. Dryden makes a fine Santa indeed.</p>

If I was mall security, I probably would have asked myself what I was doing. Luckily, even after spending six hours at Southgate during the height of the Christmas shopping season, I was still only halfway to looking like the guy from One Hour Photo.

The glee? Due to the prospect that I was actually going to be interviewing Santa for our most recent Edmonton: A City segment. Not only that, but I would actually have a period of time to talk to him for myself, not just a couple minutes before being kicked out of there. It was a childhood dream. Even as an adult, there was something that felt undeniably fun about going to meet Santa. Maybe he&#039;d even let me sit on his knee.

And, meeting Santa lived up to expectations (except for the knee-sitting thing). Carrying a brown messenger bag with him, which I will assume was where he kept the naughty/nice list, Santa descended down the walkway to greet me. We walked down the mall to the employee breakroom (where Santa hangs during his breaks), as he waved to passing adults and children, charismatically playing the crowd. It was interesting to see how many adults—approximately 0.01% of whom had anything resembling a smile on their face in the midst of Christmas shopping— lit up when they saw Santa, even as much as the kids. It was like seeing him triggered a brief reconnection with childhood memories and feelings of what Christmas is truly about.

I sat down and talked to Santa, a.k.a. Francis Dryden (which I can only assume is his codename), for around 40 minutes—so long that we decided to post the entire interview, for your festive seasonal enjoyment! And if you don&#039;t listen...you&#039;re getting a lump of coal this Christmas.

In it, we discussed:

	beards (and how fake-bearded Santas are an exercise in charlatanry)
	why some kids have difficulty seeing the economic difference between “toys” and “iPads”
	irritating parents who complain to mall management when Santa tells those kids he can’t produce said iPads
	the physical rigours of working 8 hours a day for a month and a half lifting 50-pound kids onto your knee
	why he doesn’t use chimneys anymore
	his background as a rock drummer formerly nicknamed Captain Crunch (yes, really)
	his genuine love for children and work with the Shriners

As the interview went on, it started to become more apparent that he truly sounded like the real deal; someone who went out of their way to selflessly make kids happy. If Santa is a symbol of compassion and love for children, then Mr. Dryden makes a fine Santa indeed.</itunes:summary>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to our Season 2 <em><strong>Season Finale!!</strong></em> Truly, a finale that merits both bolds AND italics.</p>

We talk origins of their comic concept, which launches on July 4, the day America elected Bill Pullman as President whereupon they were mercilessly attacked by aliens. You know the story.</p>
<p>But what you don&#8217;t know is that the rest of the show contains <a href="http://www.calgaryexpo.com/" target="_blank">Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo</a> goodness, a <a href="http://www.travelingtickletrunk.com/index.html" target="_blank">Sex Talk Segment</a> (Happy Julyna!), and two terrific stories from the June edition of <a href="http://www.edmontonstoryslam.com/" target="_blank">Edmonton Story Slam</a>. Here&#8217;s the breakdown:</p>
<p>0:00: Intro &#8211; &#8220;Web comics and paper cuts&#8221;<br />
2:08: Inglorious Hipsters and childhood friendships<br />

1:12:12: You&#8217;re so hipster and you don&#8217;t even know it<br />
1:25:45: The Fast 16 with Jeremy Die and Gregg Beever</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it for us, as we take our summer break. The Unknown Studio will be back in August with wonderful episodes and best-laid plans. Enjoy your Julyna!</p>

		<itunes:summary>We&#039;re well into the last half of our second season, and our twentieth episode has lots of hot juicy Edmonton goodness we&#039;d like to cram directly into your ear holes.

Scott and I invited Michael Otto and Scott Lilwall — authors of a fantastic urban planning blog called The Charrette — onto the show to talk about the growth of this great urban centre some of us call home.

We also have a Sex Talk segment that includes toy reviews, just in time for Easter; we were live at the launch of the Edmonton Champions Project; and we even bring you information on exciting changes at Guru Digital Arts College.

Here&#039;s the show breakdown...

0:00: Intro &quot;WTF?&quot;
2:00: They call him Lilwall. And they call HIM Motto.
17:01: Sex Talk — Easter Eggs and Bunnies
19:54: That arena sure is a sticky wicket.
43:35: The Edmonton Champions Project Launch.
59:43: GalaGuru 3: A celebration of great success.
1:13:31: SimCity 3000.
1:28:09: The Fast 16 with the Charrette boys.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the twelfth episode of our second season. </p>
<p>This is a very special episode of the show, because it kind of forced Scott and I to do things a little different. Some months back, we were invited by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/archiemc">Archie McLean</a>, the chair of the <a href="http://www.macewan.ca/web/pvca/journalism/home/index.cfm">journalism program at Grant MacEwan University</a>, to come into his Intro to Mass Communications class and chat about how social media tech is changing journalism. And Archie, being the forward-thinking guy that he is, suggested we record a show in his class. A great idea, right?</p>
<p>Except the Unknown Studio lacked the tech to actually get this done. So we had to go out and buy it.</p>
<p>And we had such a great experience recording the show in front of a live audience, that we&#8217;re eager to do it again. So, fair listener, give some thought as to where we might record to our next live studio audience. And enjoy this latest and greatest episode!</p>
<p>Here’s the show breakdown:</p>
<p>0:00: Intro “Teacher&#8217;s pets”<br />
9:00: Talking to Archie and his class, part 1<br />
15:48: The Unknown Studio checks out StartupEdmonton&#8217;s Launch Party 2<br />

We went all out for you guys this week, scoring an EXCLUSIVE* interview with local software developers Joel Jackson and Sean Healy! Their claim to fame? They won the bronze prize in the Apps4Edmonton contest, with the creation of a texting application that allows users to figure out bus schedules in real-time. If you want to know more, you&#039;ll just have to listen to the episode. And you&#039;ll definitely want to listen if you want to hear my impression of a giraffe.

On that note, here&#039;s a breakdown:

0:00: Show Intro - By the Power of Greyskull.
2:00: We talk software applications with Sean and Joel.
11:36: Edmonton election nomination day check-in with Dave Cournoyer.
22:09: Part 2 of our interview with Sean and Joel.
41:45: After-action report of Vue Weekly&#039;s first annual Blue Revue with Jeanne-Marie Owens.
49:43: Follow-up with Carrie Robinson - will she be on Wipeout Canada?
55:32: Part 3 of our interview with Sean and Joel.
1:11:25: the Fast Sixteen.

Let us know what you thought, everyone! Do you love us? Hate us? TELL US!

EDMONTON JOURNAL STILL SPONSORS THE UNKNOWN STUDIO
=====================================================

It’s true! After so much joking and tongue-in-cheek referrals to Edmonton’s newspaper of record on our show, the Edmonton Journal decided to put their money where our mouths are, by sponsoring the Unknown Studio this month!

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few months back, the Unknown Studio received word of the launch of a new social network. You may have heard of it — <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/06/04/empire-avenue/" target="_blank">Mashable posted an article on the new People&#8217;s Market called Empire Avenue</a>. Scott and I got into the system and I think it&#8217;s fair to say both of us are pretty hooked&#8230; So much so that we&#8217;re variously experimenting with ways to determine just what it is that raises and lowers our stock prices.</p>
<p>(By the way, you should invest in <a href="http://empireavenue.com/influencer/?u=843" target="_blank">TUS</a>, <a href="http://empireavenue.com/influencer/?u=151" target="_blank">BNGFL</a> and <a href="http://empireavenue.com/influencer/?u=761" target="_blank">SCB</a>)</p>
<p>And, since we actually can&#8217;t figure it all out, we decided to get <a href="http://empireavenue.com/" target="_blank">Empire Avenue</a> Marketing Manager Tom Ohle on the show to pick his brain and get a handle on this whole insider trading thing&#8230; if only we could convince Tom to give us some tips.</p>
<p>So we dish about Empire Avenue, but we also get into some heady discussions about Star Trek and Scott&#8217;s learned fear of garbage trucks, Apple and their closed systems, and finally we talk about what&#8217;s been on everyone&#8217;s mind these last few years: whether or not Drew Carey has ruined the Price is Right forever.</p>
<p>This is the last episode of the season (technically, Scott and I are tracking seasons for the show. This is S01E26), and it&#8217;s a great note to end things off with. Give it a listen, leave us a comment or two, and stay tuned for our season premiere in just two short week!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Until very recently — perhaps as recently as five or seven years ago — Edmonton suffered a dearth of great cafés and restaurants. Oh sure, there were diamonds in the rough, but the rough was expansive and the diamonds as rare as something even more rare than diamonds.</p>
<p>Then, the landscape started changing, as Edmonton&#8217;s downtown began its still-ongoing revitalization. Now, the city is blessed with great eating and drinking establishments. That means the time is ripe for <a href="http://twitter.com/nathanbox" target="_blank">Nate Box</a> to open the <a href="http://www.elmcafe.ca" target="_blank">Elm Café</a>.</p>
<p>Well over one year in the making, Nate had originally wanted to open the café as a restaurant concept in the Belgravia neighbourhood on Edmonton&#8217;s southside. But the lease fell through and so it was back to the drawing board. Last March, though, things started coming together for Nate, when he locked down a location in Oliver — the west part of Edmonton&#8217;s downtown (outside of the core).</p>
<p>With the Elm Café slated to open on Monday, June 7 (bright and early at 7am), Scott and I decided to sit down with Nate and find out exactly what it takes to open a café in the this town. We also talk hamburger waterslides, and some of the worst food trends sweeping the city.</p>

She&#8217;s a pillar of the community, a big Edmonton booster, and an all-around great woman. So we decided to invite her onto the show to get her perspective on living and working in Edmonton in a rather public role.</p>
<p>And wouldn&#8217;t you know it, but Lynda is extremely down-to-earth and fun. Scott and I spent just over an hour chatting with her about how she got into her job as a news anchor, how news has changed, and what it&#8217;s like to be a news personality who gets noticed out in public. I even reveal details about the first time I met Lynda — intoxicated at a hockey game, and probably a little overly friendly.<span id="more-2380"></span></p>
<p>But wait! THERE&#8217;S MORE! <a href="http://theunknownstudio.ca/2010/03/this-just-in-weird-move-old-media/" target="_blank">We even spent a bit of time talking to her about her sudden jump off of Twitter</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You may not know this — and you may not even agree with it — but Edmonton is a very musical place. We produce a ton of musicians who go on to do great things. Hell, some of them even choose to stay here in town and ply their trade (I&#8217;m thinking Bill Bourne of <a href="http://www.efmf.ab.ca" target="_blank">Edmonton Folk Music Festival</a> fame).</p>
<p>With such a rich and diverse cross-section of musical talent in Edmonton, Scott and I decided to chat this week with one of Edmonton&#8217;s up-and-comers. So we brought the talented, the beautiful, the holy-crap-listen-her-amazing-voice Erica Viegas. And you know what Erica told us? She told us that she wanted the use the Unknown Studio to release a new track out into the world. All exclusive-like. So listen to the show for something we can guarantee you&#8217;ve never heard before.</p>
<p>Quickly, and <a href="http://www.ericaviegas.com/" target="_blank">stolen from her website</a>, this is what Erica&#8217;s all about:</p>
<blockquote><p>Raised in Sherwood Park, Alberta in a musical family, Erica has always had a passion for music. Since begging her parents to let her take voice lessons at age 11, she grabbed at every opportunity to be on stage, whether it was singing in a school play or performing the national anthem at an assembly. For more than 10 years, she has been singing at festivals and talent competitions all over Western Canada, including the Alberta Tattoo at Rexall Place, Calgary Stampede, Big Valley Jamboree, and Canadian Search for Miss Universe. In 2003 and 2004, Erica represented the City of Edmonton as Klondike Katie during the Edmonton Klondike Days (now Capital Ex), performing over 50 times during the 10-day festival.</p></blockquote>
<p>Erica&#8217;s also a U of A Business School graduate with a day job at her alma mater. And she&#8217;s looking to maybe tour this summer, across Canada or even the US.</p>
<p>And I am going to make it my personal mission to try and <strong>get Erica up on the stage at the Folk Fest this summer</strong>, at the very least as someone who can perform in between main stage sets. She&#8217;s that good. So good, I think a lot of people need to hear her. So download the episode today!</p>

<p>But it&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>Fate conspired against us last weekend, but we persevered. And in what may be our least-listened-to podcast to day, we talk about&#8230; well, the Unknown Studio. We discussed some of the drama that&#8217;s recently cropped up around the show — nothing scandalous, mind you. Just worthy of note. Noteworthy, if you&#8217;re into the whole brevity thing.</p>
<p>We also talk plans for the future — but only very briefly so as not to give away all the fabulous surprises we have. And rather than end with a Fast 15, we end with a new random segment called &#8220;Ridiculous Questions that Have Little Bearing on Anything.&#8221;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone in Edmonton who&#8217;s been involved in social media fundraising in Edmonton will have heard the name &#8220;<a href="http://www.twitter.com/achromatica" target="_blank">Roma Sobieski</a>.&#8221; If you haven&#8217;t heard that name, then you&#8217;ve doubtless seen the hashtag #yegroma.</p>
<p>Roma Sobieski first appeared on our radar when she started working with <a href="http://www.twitter.com/zoomjer" target="_blank">Jerry Aulenbach</a> on a fundraiser for the <a href="http://camta.com/" target="_blank">Canadian Association of Medical Teams Abroad</a>, who have done some outstanding work providing surgeries to individuals in Ecuador. Roma was raising money to actually go spend a week in Ecuador to assist the doctors and nurses there with patients. The response to her campaign was nothing short of incredible.</p>
<p>In this episode, Scott and I chat with Roma about her hopes and dreams of becoming a pediatric surgeon, and also the amazing time she had working with doctors and patients in Central America (where, it turns out, it wasn&#8217;t so warm in March).</p>
<p>Also worth noting: we recorded this episode on Roma&#8217;s birthday, but we were too polite to ask her how old she was.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The City of Edmonton is very fortunate to have the knowledge economy contributors that we can call our own. I might even argue that many of the people who have come onto the Unknown Studio as guests are among the pillars of this new wave.</p>
<p>We spoke to one of those pillars in our most recent episode, which you can download below. Hi name is Ken Bautista, and he&#8217;s officially one of Edmonton&#8217;s &#8220;big deals.&#8221; <a href="http://www.kenbautista.com" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s some info on Ken from his website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ken Bautista, 32, has over 10 years experience in the interactive industry as an entrepreneur and creative director.</p>
<p>He founded his first interactive development company, Hotrocket, in 2001 after graduating from the University of Alberta with a Bachelor’s Degree in Education. In 2008, the company’s interactive services division was acquired by RED The Agency, one of the fastest growing independent marketing agencies in Western Canada.</p>
<p>Ken is currently working on his second start-up seekyourownproof.com, an online community for kids ages 8-12 where they’re challenged to investigate science and history as agents of a fictional agency called the “Central Institute for Exploration”.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ken&#8217;s also involved in <a href="http://www.artssceneedmonton.com/" target="_blank">ArtsScene Edmonton</a>, <a href="http://www.startupedmonton.com/" target="_blank">Startup Edmonton</a>, and <a href="http://www.tedxedmonton.com/" target="_blank">TEDx Edmonton</a>.</p>
<p>Scott and I picked his brain for a good hour on the projects Ken&#8217;s working on, why he&#8217;s still living in Edmonton, and what the future holds for yet another of <a href="http://www.avenueedmonton.com/top40under40" target="_blank">Avenue Magazine&#8217;s Top 40 Under 40</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people in Edmonton know the name &#8220;<a href="http://www.mastermaq.ca">Mack Male</a>&#8220;. A young Edmontonian, one of the champions of the <a href="http://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/open-data.aspx" target="_blank">Open Data</a> movement, local software developer and blogger, and social media maven, <a href="http://twitter.com/mastermaq" target="_blank">Mack</a> has [perhaps inadvertently] asserted himself as what I&#8217;ve come to refer to as Edmonton&#8217;s prodigal digital son. &#8220;Prodigal&#8221; because he is a prodigious individual who once moved away to the Territories, but ultimately returned to the City of Champions. &#8220;Digital&#8221; because he exists nowhere but on the internets, and anyone who does meet Mack in person should know they&#8217;re interacting with an advanced robot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kidding. Mack&#8217;s no robot. In fact, he&#8217;s one of the smartest and nicest people I&#8217;ve met in this city.</p>
<p>My first encounter with Mack was at <a href="http://www.barcampedmonton.com/2008/08/democamp-edmonton-3/" target="_blank">DemoCamp 3</a>, I believe. He was the young dude taking photos of everyone and assisting Cam Linke and Kevin Swan with the event. He looked like any other geek. When I eventually found my way onto Twitter, I realized that in the ever-growing Edmonton online community, Mack is a key influencer. A Big Deal™, if you will.</p>
<p>Mack and I have become friends over the last few years, as our paths cross fairly often due to several shared passions. It made sense to have him on the show. It&#8217;s taken us too long to get him into the studio.</p>
<p>So, Scott and I present to you the Mack Male episode, where we discuss his views on the Open Data movement, social media, blogging and even what life up north was like. If you enjoy it or not, leave a comment and let us know!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever listened to our show for any reasonable period of time (say, about 5 minutes), you&#8217;ll likely have discovered that Scott and I thoroughly enjoy movies. From the most complicated and grueling bit of German Expressionism to the comedic stylings of Lloyd and Harry, we are like the obsessed fanboys of the medium of film. And with the <a href="http://oscar.go.com/" target="_blank">82nd Annual Academy Awards</a> coming to a television set near you on Sunday March 7, we thought we&#8217;d share our thoughts, feelings and indulges with our listening public.</p>
<p>But we couldn&#8217;t do it alone. So we brought in David Berry, Vue Weekly arts writer and local freelance journalist.</p>
<p>In our Oscar episode, we&#8217;ll share our predictions, opinions (both informed and uninformed) and thoughts on the movies of 2009 that made the greatest impact. And we&#8217;ll even complain that Star Trek wasn&#8217;t nominated for Best Picture. Remember: fanboys.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For our Valentine&#8217;s Day episode, we decided to do something a little different. Rather than try and think of ways to provide people with advice on gifts or things to do, we thought we&#8217;d talk about one of the big things that may (or may not be) on people&#8217;s minds this V-Day: sex. And in order to do that, we spoke with <a href="http://travelingtickletrunk.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=26&amp;Itemid=34" target="_blank">Brenda Kerber</a>, owner of Edmonton&#8217;s <a href="http://www.travelingtickletrunk.com/" target="_blank">Traveling Tickle Trunk</a> about sex toys, sexual health, the people&#8217;s attitudes and openness toward sexuality in general.</p>
<p>Brenda showed Scott and I some of the terrible, poorly made sex toys there are on the market. And they&#8217;re terrifyingly shabby. She also showed us some spectacular products that are top of the line (and some of them more resemble something you&#8217;d see Apple design than a sex toy manufacturer).</p>
<p>Brenda also shared her thoughts on North America&#8217;s attitude toward sex, and some of the more puzzling aspects of sex education, particularly in Alberta.</p>
<p>Finally, for listeners of the Unknown Studio who download and listen to the episode, you&#8217;ll hear a very special offer from Brenda to you for Valentine&#8217;s day&#8230; But you have to download the episode and listen through for details and take advantage of it before Valentine&#8217;s Day.</p>
<p>Check out our Flickr group for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1296633@N21/" target="_blank">some photos of the sex toys Brenda showed us</a>, and be sure to leave your thoughts in the comments section!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In keeping with our seemingly recent theme of covering different aspects of the journalistic profession, Scott and I played host to <a href="http://www.inews880.com" target="_blank">iNews880.com</a> news reporter <a href="http://twitter.com/JeremyiNews880" target="_blank">Jeremy Lye</a>. Jeremy, originally from Australia, spent some of his professional life covering corruption and drugs wars taking place in Central America, particularly places like Honduras and Guatemala. We wanted to know Jeremy&#8217;s perspective on what it&#8217;s like to work in foreign places, where you might not know the language and customs so well.</p>
<p>Jeremy shared some of his scary moments with us, and some of his thoughts on why he would place himself in those situations, and now his perception of traveling to dangerous places has changed now that he&#8217;s a dad (though he definitely gave us the impression that once his kids grow up, he&#8217;s right back on the foreign journalism train). Then we also talk about how Australians don&#8217;t drink Fosters, and how awesome the snow is here (seriously, Jeremy loves the snow).</p>
<p>Give the episode a listen, and share your thoughts in the comments section or give us a review on the iTunes music store!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Well, Happy New Year to our twenties of listeners. Scott and I enjoyed our break, but we were both also very eager to get back into the swing of things&#8230;</p>
<p>In our fifteenth episode, we sit down with <em>Gateway </em>Editor-in-Chief <a href="http://twitter.com/mike_kendrick" target="_blank">Mike Kendrick</a> and Canadian University Press President <a href="http://twitter.com/CUPtastic" target="_blank">Rob Fishbook</a> to discuss the upcoming <a href="http://www.cup.ca/naturalselection/" target="_blank">National Journalism Conference</a> being hosted in Edmonton by the <a href="http://thegatewayonline.ca/" target="_blank"><em>Gateway</em></a> and <a href="http://www.cup.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian University Press</a> (CUP) this coming weekend. This event sees hundreds of student journalists descend on the city for a weekend AGM and professional development conference. The line-up of speakers giving talks at this year&#8217;s conference (affectionately called &#8220;Nash&#8221; by salty old-school CUPpies like myself) includes such luminaries as Jan Wong, Adrienne Arsenault&#8230; and Scott and myself, if you can believe it.</p>
<p>We also discuss the changing media of student journalism and some of the interesting content and technological challenges that CUP is helping its members tackle — we even get a bit of a sneak peak at CUP&#8217;s soon-to-be-launched proprietary content management system for member papers.</p>
<p>Finally, and you&#8217;ll never believe this, I got to work in a Star Trek reference. All in all a great show and a terrific start to the New Year.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I know you&#8217;ve been waiting for this. It&#8217;s like a new Christmas tradition! Instead of going to church or opening presents, you can all gather &#8217;round the old iTunes box and listen to that there podcast what&#8217;s hosted by those sweet, sensitive young men, Mr Scott C Bourgeois and Mr Adam Rozenhart.<span id="more-1426"></span></p>
<p>Scott and I decided to make our first Christmas episode a little bit different — so we told the guest we&#8217;d had booked to go fly a sleigh. Rather than interview someone, we have a &#8220;conversation&#8221; with each other. We discuss our families&#8217; Christmas traditions and the Christmas films we enjoy; we share stories from some of our listeners who had some nightmarish Mall Santa experiences (actually, that would be a great name for a Christmas Band: the Mall Santa Experience™); and we even exchange gifts, almost live, right there on the air!</p>
<p>So while you&#8217;re wrapping gifts, chugging some nog, or sobbing quietly to yourself, why not give us a listen? If you had a podcast, we&#8217;d listen to yours!</p>
<p>And from both Scott and his lovely finacée Anita, and from myself and my beautiful girlfriend Rachel: Merry Christmas to everyone! Enjoy the time off, enjoy the food, and enjoy each other!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard about this, but newspapers are basically effed. They can&#8217;t continue to sell ads and print their product while other &#8220;media&#8221; are starting to move their content increasingly online. The printed paper will likely die with the last baby boomer (sorry Mum and Dad, but I read my news on the computer or on my phone).<span id="more-1225"></span></p>
<p>So Scott and I decided to find out exactly <em>how</em> effed newspapers are, and what they&#8217;re doing to mitigate their, um, effedness. Thankfully, before we set out on our quest, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/karenunland" target="_blank">Karen Unland</a>, the <a href="http://www.edmontonjournal.com/" target="_blank">Edmonton Journal&#8217;s</a> online editor contacted us and suggested it would be a good topic for the show.</p>
<p>We agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-1227  aligncenter" title="noothpapuh" src="http://theunknownstudio.ca/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/noothpapuh.jpg" alt="noothpapuh" width="500" height="297" /></p>
<p>In our thirteenth episode (woooo! dun, dun, <strong>DUN</strong>) we try to sort out what direction news media is moving in and what some of the models could be for continuing to run &#8220;newspapers&#8221; online, while paying people to, you know, provide news and analysis.</p>

<p>Scott and I think we know a thing or two about what might make Edmonton a destination city for that next generation of citizens — the people who will inherit the glorious and gross parts of our fair city. But nowhere near as much as co-chair of <a href="http://www.edmontonnextgen.ca/" target="_self">Edmonton Next Gen</a> Cary Williams does.<span id="more-717"></span></p>
<p>I first met Cary back at University. He was a strapping young go-getter eager to make a splash in the world of business. Like, a belly-flop splash. Particularly in the Asian world of business. Through school exchanges and his first (?) post-post-secondary job, Cary spent a lot of time in Asia, thinking he might make his life there. In fact, in a recent issue of <a href="http://avenueedmonton.com/articles/page/item/cary-williams" target="_blank">Avenue Magazine</a> Cary said, &#8220;I spent 10 years trying to figure out how I&#8217;d never live in Edmonton [...]&#8221;</p>
<p>He then goes on to say something about dressing like a cheerleader. But he can do that, because he&#8217;s one of the <a href="http://avenueedmonton.com/articles/page/item/top-40-under-40" target="_blank">Top 40 Under 40</a>.</p>
<p>In spite of Cary&#8217;s proclivities toward mini-skirts — indeed because of it — Scott and I sat down with him to sort out why he decided to make Edmonton his home, and why he&#8217;s now one of the City of Champion&#8217;s biggest, uh, champions. We also discuss the city&#8217;s bid for the 2017 expo and what good things it might do (or fail to do) for Edmonton. Then I spanked him across the brain with a thoroughly enjoyable <strong>Fast 15</strong>.</p>

<p>Jeff Samsonow and Sally Poulsen are the website&#8217;s creators. They&#8217;re the kind of people who, when you meet them for the first time, you&#8217;ll probably think to yourself that you&#8217;d really like to be friends with them, and that the best way to do that is to have them over for dinner, and oh I wonder if they&#8217;d like a course involving butternut squash. Both Jeff and Sally are hyper-intelligent individuals with media backgrounds who decided to try and enrich the place they&#8217;ve chosen to live. They both also have killer senses of humour. That&#8217;s where TheEdmontonian.com comes in.</p>
<p>Scott and I sat down with Jeff and Sally to talk about why they started the website, some of the challenges they&#8217;ve had to deal with since its inception (hilariously enough, it launch in the same month as the Unknown Studio. So, we&#8217;re like internet brethren), and where they hope the website goes. We had a blast talking with Jeff and Sally, and I&#8217;m hoping they&#8217;ll come to subsequent recordings of the show, since Scott and I are always looking for great conversation, and more content for our blooper reel.</p>
<p>Other things we learned about Jeff and Sally: Jeff must screen movies for Sally before she watches them in case they&#8217;re too scary or upsetting; they met in Winnipeg, though neither one of them is from there; they both have razor-sharp wits.</p>

<p>We spent about an hour in the studio talking about hauntings in Edmonton, and boy-howdy, are there ever a lot. We barely started to scratch the surface. And although the three of us agreed that we didn&#8217;t believe in ghosts, Marliss&#8217; stories were no less chilling.</p>
<p>We talk a little about the science of spookiness, and then get straight into some of the first- and second-hand tales of fear we&#8217;ve experienced or heard. This is an episode not for the very curious, nor for the faint of heart.</p>

<p>Also called Pure Spec by nerdy and geeky stalwarts (we love you guys!), the festival is happening for the fifth year this weekend, October 2 to 4 at the Shaw Conference Centre.

Registration is $15 before the event if you purchase from any <a href="http://www.happyharborcomics.com/" target="_blank">Happy Harbor</a> location or $20 at the door or by <a href="http://purespec.org/Registration.html">registering online</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our fifth episode, Scott and I interview young playwrights Simon Crowley and Mike Young. They&#8217;re participating in <a href="http://fringetheatre.ca/" target="_blank">Edmonton&#8217;s International Film Festival</a> this year with their one-act play <em>Captain Hook vs. the Zombies</em>.</p>

<p>In order to tackle this weighty issue, we summoned local experts Anita Kuny and <a href="http://usercreatedcontent.ca/" target="_blank">Ramin Ostad</a>.
