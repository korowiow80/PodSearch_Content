			<title>Author Rafi Mohammed Says Don&#8217;t Discount the Relationship Between Price Strategy and Profits</title>
			<description>Co-Hosts Brad Forsythe and Ray Schilens interview Rafi Mohammed, author of The 1% Windfall: How Successful Companies Use Price to Profit and Grow. Rafi has been working on pricing issues for the last 20 years. He is the founder of Culture of Profit LLC, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company that consults with businesses to help develop and improve their pricing strategy. He also holds the title of Batten Fellow at the University of Virginia's Darden Graduate School of Business (in residence, Spring 2001). A frequent commentator on pricing issues to the print media, Rafi has also made prime time appearances on CNBC as an expert pricing commentator. 
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 12px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 12px&quot;&gt;He is the author of The Art of Pricing (Crown Business, October 2005), which is the first managerially relevant book on pricing and has been translated into seven foreign languages. He is a co-author of Internet Marketing: Building Advantage in a Networked Economy (second edition - April 2003, McGraw-Hill/Irwin) which has been adopted by over 200 universities globally. Rafi's follow-up pricing book, The 1% Windfall, was published by HarperBusiness in March 2010.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 12px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 12px&quot;&gt;Rafi's doctoral dissertation focused on bundling, one of the most popular yet least understood pricing tactics. He developed a new theoretical bundling model and presented the first empirical test on the profitability of bundling using data from the rock concert industry. This research was published in the Rand Journal of Economics, a leading academic economics journal. Rafi has previously worked on pricing issues at the FCC during the telecommunications deregulation and Monitor Group. He has testified as a pricing expert in six public policy commission hearings. Rafi was born in Milwaukee and raised in Cincinnati. He is an economics graduate of Boston University, the London School of Economics &amp;amp; Political Science, and Cornell University (Ph.D.).&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hershman's global implementation of Hammer principles at Avnet led to an extensive multi-year collaboration between Hershman and Hammer.

			<title>Legendary Art Director George Lois Talks About His Book &quot;Damn Good Advice&quot; - Part II</title>
			<description>Co-Hosts Brad TForsythe and Ray Schilens interview legendary Art Director George Lois. George Lois is the most creative, prolific advertising communicator of our time. Running his own ad agencies, he is renowned for dozens of marketing miracles that triggered innovative and populist changes in American (and world) culture. In his twenties he was a pioneer of the landmark Creative Revolution in American Advertising. He introduced and popularized the Xerox culture; he created the concept and prototype design for the New York supplement for the Herald Tribune (the forerunner of New York magazine); made a failing MTV a huge success with his &#8220;I Want My MTV&#8221; campaign; helped create and introduce VH1; created a new marketing category, Gourmet Frozen Foods, with his name Lean Cuisine; and (by inventing yet another new marketing phenomenon) persuaded America to change their motor oil at thousands of Jiffy Lube stations. He made the totally unknown Tommy Hilfiger immediately famous with just one ad; and saved USA Today from extinction with his breakthrough &#8220;singing&#8221; TV campaign. In 1994, almost overnight, he changed the perception of ESPN from a &#8220;Demolition Derby&#8221; sports channel to the number one sports network with his dynamic &#8220;In Your Face&#8221; campaign. Additionally he created the winning ad campaigns for four U.S.Senators: Jacob Javits (R-NY); Warren Magnuson (D-WA); Minority Leader Hugh Scott (R-PA); Robert Kennedy (D-NY). His list of breakthrough ad campaigns goes on and on. Additionally, the only music video he created, Jokerman by Bob Dylan, won the MTV Best Music Video of the Year Award in 1983. George Lois is the only person in the world inducted into The Art Directors Hall of Fame, The One Club Creative Hall of Fame, with Lifetime Achievement Awards from the American Institute of Graphic Arts, the Society of Publication Designers, as well as a subject of the Master Series at the School of Visual Arts. He is the author of George, be Careful (Saturday Review Press, 1972), an autobiography; The Art of Advertising (Abrams, 1976), praised as &#8220;the bible of mass communications&#8221;; What&#8217;s the Big Idea? (Doubleday, 1991), used as a text book in college communications courses all over the world; Covering the &#8217;60s (The Monacelli Press, 1996), presenting his iconic Esquire covers during that turbulent decade; $ellebrity (Phaidon, 2003), a brilliantly reviewed book dealing with his extraordinary campaigns using celebrities in fresh and outrageous ways; Ali Rap, The First Heavyweight Champion of Rap (Taschen/ESPN, 2006), a compilation of over 300 rap rhythms, witticisms, insults and wisecracks from Muhammad Ali, wittily and powerfully visualized; and Iconic America (Rizzoli/Universe, 2007), a roller coaster ride through the eye-popping panorama of American pop culture; and his eighth, and most recent book, George Lois on his Creation of The Big Idea (Assouline, 2008), a mind-boggling archeological dig revealing the influences on 100 of his Big Ideas. In 2008 the Museum of Modern Art installed 38 of the iconic Esquire covers in its permanent collection, celebrated by a year-long exhibit: George Lois: The Esquire Covers @ MoMA. A new book celebrating the MoMA installation was published by Assouline in March 2010.

			<title>Art Consultant and Marketing Expert Katharine T. Carter Shares Wisdom and Advice on How to Succeed in the Complex World of Art</title>
			<description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;Co-hosts Brad Forsythe and Ray Schilens interview Katharine T. Carter, Art Consultant &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;and Author, Accelerating on the Curves: The Artist's Roadmap to Success.&amp;nbsp;O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;ne could aptly describe Katharine T. Carter as a &#8220;disarming dichotomy of Southern gentility and New York brass.&#8221;&amp;nbsp;This duality, and an insistence on purposeful hard work and no-nonsense practicum has served her well in all her endeavors, past and present - professional photographer, successful New York City painter, small business owner, arts lecturer and artist advisor.&amp;nbsp;Her knowledge of the art world spans decades, and her experience and expertise come from hands-on implementation of her principles.&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;Carter spent ten years on the road, traveling coast to coast, spending as much as 250 days per year lecturing on current trends in contemporary art and speaking to all levels of professional career development.&amp;nbsp;While Katharine has lectured to thousands of artists, she has also personally met and counseled hundreds of artists with the intent of guiding them along their unique paths to artistic success. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;Katharine recognized a common thread in each one&#8211;&#8211;the need for more specific practical information on effective marketing strategies tailored to individual desire, level of accomplishment and lifestyle. Drawing on her wide range of knowledge of the New York arena, the breadth and scope of her professional experience, and her personal &#8220;trial and error&#8221; experiences as a practicing artist, Carter successfully developed comprehensive seminars and field trips designed to de-mystify the process of career development.&amp;nbsp;Her practical approach, as well as a realistic understanding of how each artist fits into the current art marketplace, make her seminars and consultations invaluable to artists at all levels.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;As a practicing artist, Carter has exhibited her work in New York at The New Museum, the Institute of Contemporary Art at P.S. 1, and the Hal Bromm Gallery.&amp;nbsp;She has had over 20 one-woman exhibitions in museums and leading college and university art galleries throughout the country. Her paintings have received attention from critics of national and international prominence such as: Donald Kuspit, William Zimmer, Robert Mahoney, Peter Frank and Vivian Raynor.&amp;nbsp;She received five reviews in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; alone, one with noted critic John Russell. Her teaching credits include: Drew University, Rutgers University, University of the South, the State University of New York and other colleges in New Jersey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;In 2010, Katharine T. Carter in collaboration with her Associates and Running Hare Press published a large format reference book titled &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Accelerating on the Curves: The Artist&#8217;s Roadmap to Success&lt;/em&gt;. The book &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;was featured in the February, 2011 issue of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Art in America&lt;/em&gt;, and reviewed in publications including &lt;em&gt;Sculpture Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Resolve 40&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;FAME NY, Chicago Art&lt;/em&gt; and numerous other outlets. Upcoming reviews include &lt;em&gt;ARTnews&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;dArt International&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Artist Magazine, American Craft &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Ceramic Review&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;Carter now devotes her time fully to furthering the careers of artists across the country, and working with institutions, galleries, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Palatino; color: black; font-size: 10pt&quot;&gt;and critics to create synergistic and interdependent solutions for success in today&#8217;s contemporary art world. She has booked over 700 one-person exhibitions for her clients at museums, art centers and better college and university galleries.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
