      <title>The Best Of Hair with Adriana aka Alex Taylor</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/27280/600x600_5327397.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adriana and I went to high school together, but after high school nobody really knew what became of her. Many classmates have always asked about her and wondered what became of little Adriana. It turns out that the person I went to school with, became a dancer, a Penthouse super model, a featured entertainer in Las Vegas, and became a Vivid Girl starring in a few classic porn videos. It's amazing where our lives will take us, and I want to thank Adriana for sharing her story. Named Miss Hampton Beach in 1984, Adriana took a path less traveled, but nevertheless it brought her national fame and super stardom. The Argentina native not only went on to win Miss New Hampshire in 1991, but also became a well-known adult entertainment performer known as Alex Taylor. Taylor was named Penthouse Pet of the Month in 1994, and appeared in the magazine more than 30 times.

From 1998 to 2004, she worked for Vivid Entertainment as an adult actress, starring in such films as the adult classic &quot;Where the Boys Aren't 12.&quot; She has since retired from the industry and resides in Orlando, Fla.</description>

      <title>The Best Of Hair with DJ Ravenwolf and special guest Hayden Black (video)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/27280/600x600_5225948.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hayden Black is an English comedian and writer best known for critical and commercial comedy Internet hits Goodnight Burbank and Abigail&#8217;s Teen Diary.

Black left a career as an on-air promo producer for the networks to form his own production company Haydenism Inc. Since forming in 2005 he has created, written and acted in some of the most popular shows the web has seen. The Guardian calls him &#8220;one of Internet comedy&#8217;s brightest stars&#8221;.

His first show, Goodnight Burbank, has picked up numerous awards and nominations and has been called a &#8220;wicked satire, bracingly funny&#8230; competitive with the very best that networks have to offer&#8221; by the LA Times and &#8220;one of my favorite shows&#8221; by the Wall Sreet Journal&#8217;s Walt Mossberg.

In 2007 Black launched Abi&#8217;s Teen Diary (also known as Abigail&#8217;s X-Rated Teen Diary) about a 13 year old girl with a fictional genetic condition that gives her the appearance of a man in his thirties. It too was nominated for awards and was called &quot;silly, funny &amp; sometimes poignant&quot; by the Manchester Evening News and &quot;cutting-edge comedy&quot; by Fortune magazine.

In 2009, Black created a six-part comedy for Babelgum.com called The Occulterers. A comedy-horror, it co-starred Black alongside Ellen Sandweiss (The Evil Dead), James C. Leary (Buffy), and Camden Toy (Buffy/Angel). He also shot a pilot for The Cabonauts, a sci-fi musical comedy co-starring Star Trek&#8217;s Nichelle Nichols.

Black released the first-ever half-hour comedy created for the internet in April 2011 in the form of a rebooted Goodnight Burbank. Along with Black it co-stars Laura Silverman, Dominic Monaghan, Miracle Laurie and John Barrowman.

Goodnight Burbank made IMDB's Top 50 TV series to premiere in 2011

It&#8217;s an origin story centered around Cody&#8217;s character, &#8216;Thor&#8217;, where the young hero must battle the villainous &#8216;Loki&#8217; (played by Richard Grieco) before he destroys the world of men and gods.  The film also stars Patricia Velasquez (The Mummy) as the demigoddess &#8216;Jarnsaxa&#8217; who is Thor&#8217;s love interest; Kevin Nash (former TNA Wrestler) plays Thor&#8217;s father, &#8216;Odin&#8217;.
 
Immediately following his superhero role in ALMIGHTY THOR, Cody switches sides to play the super villain, &#8216;Mark HardOn&#8217;, in the Comedy/Action feature film SUPERSEEDS.  It is a film flowing in the vein of recent successes such as SUPERBAD, HAROLD AND KUMAR, and KICK ASS.  He recently wrapped a supporting role as a motorcycle cop who pulls over Amanda Righetti (The Mentalist) and Jonathan Bennett (Van Wilder: Freshman Year) in the film CATS JUMPING ON JUPITER. His other credits include roles in the HANGOVER and GET HIM TO THE GREEK.  He has appeared on THE VIEW, THE TODAY SHOW, and Criss Angel&#8217;s MINDFREAK.</description>

Despite many lineup changes, occasional splits within the group, and the ever-changing trends in popular music, the band have continued for more than 40 years and still retain a large following. They have sold over 30 million albums. The band's music blends symphonic and other &quot;classical&quot; structures with their own brand of rock music.

Although the band's sole consistent member has been bass player Chris Squire, Yes are also generally noted for the distinctive high-register vocals of former lead singer Jon Anderson and the eclectic musical stylings of a succession of guitarists (Steve Howe, Peter Banks, Trevor Rabin, Billy Sherwood), keyboard players (Rick Wakeman, Tony Kaye, Patrick Moraz, Geoff Downes, Igor Khoroshev, Oliver Wakeman), and drummers (Alan White and Bill Bruford). Several band members became celebrated musicians and/or bandleaders in their own right, and a 1980 lineup of the band was briefly fronted by Trevor Horn (shortly before he became one of rock music's most celebrated record producers). The band's current lineup are Squire, Howe, White, Oliver Wakeman (keyboards) and Beno&#238;t David (lead vocals)</description>

      <itunes:summary>YES are an English progressive rock band formed in London in 1968, generally regarded as one of the archetypal bands and pioneers of the genre. Despite many lineup changes, occasional splits within the group, and the ever-changing trends in popular music, the band have continued for more than 40 years and still retain a large following. They have sold over 30 million albums. The band's music blends symphonic and other &quot;classical&quot; structures with their own brand of rock music.

Although the band's sole consistent member has been bass player Chris Squire, Yes are also generally noted for the distinctive high-register vocals of former lead singer Jon Anderson and the eclectic musical stylings of a succession of guitarists (Steve Howe, Peter Banks, Trevor Rabin, Billy Sherwood), keyboard players (Rick Wakeman, Tony Kaye, Patrick Moraz, Geoff Downes, Igor Khoroshev, Oliver Wakeman), and drummers (Alan White and Bill Bruford). Several band members became celebrated musicians and/or bandleaders in their own right, and a 1980 lineup of the band was briefly fronted by Trevor Horn (shortly before he became one of rock music's most celebrated record producers). The band's current lineup are Squire, Howe, White, Oliver Wakeman (keyboards) and Beno&#238;t David (lead vocals)</itunes:summary>

It's been an amazing 25 years with a lot of ups, and a lot of downs. Success can sometimes come with a heavy price, but when it comes to these four guys, faith in Christ has seen them through the worst of times. Thanks to Oz for coming on the show and special thanks to the guys in Stryper for the amazing tunes and teaching us that Christian music doesn't have to be boring!
