Bryon, from the Out of Order Show (http://www.oooshow.com), and DJ G and Carman from The G Spod (http://www.thegspod.com) are this week's guest hosts.

We have some pretty cool news, including toking it up in the Great White North, and some unique urinals.  Travis doesn't like Chuck Norris, but thinks David Carradine is cool.  So much info that you just have to listen.  Not to mention that the show is so big that it's in two parts.  Part two coming soon!</description>

We have news, and Teri shares some pretty cool Top Ten lists.

We are planning on doing more of these kinds of shows in the future.  So, if you're intersted, e-mail us at: theunradioshow@gmail.com.  Upon doing so, give us your Skype usernames.  Enjoy!</description>
