			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>100 bucks a week in gas. That douchey radio DJ who nicknamed himself “Thunder.”  The Hummer in front of you with the “NUMBER1STUNNA” vanity plate. There’s tons of stuff that sucks about commuting to and from work. You know what’s worse than tolls, road rage and endless classic rock though? Becoming an out-of-shape, unhealthy tub of lard. According to a recent study, that half-hour drive to your cushy job at the pirate-themed mini golf course could have a serious impact on your health.</p>
<div id="attachment_33811" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 430px"><img class="size-full wp-image-33811" title="It's killing you" src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jams2.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="273" /><p class="wp-caption-text">It&#39;s killing you</p></div>
<p>Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine found that those with long car commutes are at greater risk of obesity and less likely to participate in physical activities. The team, led by Christine M. Hoehner PhD, studied more than 4,000 adults from Texas between 2000 and 2007. Hoehner and other researchers measured each participant’s body mass index, cardiorespiratory fitness, waist circumference and other variables. They also asked each participant to report on their physical activities every week for three months.</p>
<p>The team found that, for the most part, people who drove longer distances to work participate less often in “moderate to vigorous physical activities.” They also found that these long commuters had higher blood pressures, greater body mass indices and larger waists. Those that drove over 15 miles to work were more likely to be obese and less likely to participate in the bare minimum physical activity recommended for adults. The full study, “Commuting Distance, Cardiorespiratory Fitness, and Metabolic Risk,” is published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. You can read it <a href="http://www.ajpmonline.org/webfiles/images/journals/amepre/AMEPRE_3386%5B4%5D-stamped.pdf" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>What does all this mean for those of us that drive to and from the office/factory/Jack in the Box every day? The best solution might be to just quit your job altogether and eek off one of your rich uncles. If that’s not a possibility, however, you should start exercising more and/or figuring out a new way to get to work.</p>
<p>Spend an hour or two a day driving to your job and don’t think you have the time to work out? Stop making excuses. In as little as 15-30 minutes a day, depending on the intensity, you can work in a decent fitness routine. You don’t even have to go the gym. Buy some weights, run around the block, take up badminton, whatever you’ve got to do.You can even incorporate some light workouts into your commute. Sitting in traffic? Take advantage of isometric contractions! Squeeze and activate a muscle, hold for a few seconds and release. This is great for abs.</p>
<p>If possible, consider leaving your Beamer back at home. Is your job just a couple miles away? Leave a change of clothes in the breakroom and run to and from work. Riding a bike to work is another great way to stay in shape and save money on gas.</p>
<p>Just because your job is ten miles away doesn’t mean you have to start buying XXXXXXXL t-shirts. Get regular exercise and/or change your method of transportation and you’ll be a fit commuter. Whether or not you slack on the job is up to you.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey! What&#8217;s up guys?</p>
<p>Jon Sinn here—and today we I want to talk to you about Sexcalation, which is my funny made-up word for sexually escalating the interaction.</p>
<p>I actually made up the word &#8216;sexcalation&#8217; beside the fact that it sounds awesome, because I realized that a lot of what I did was to move the conversation towards sex as quickly, move the physical touching towards physical teasing, touching and arousal, kind of quasi sexual, but not offensive touching—as quickly as possible, and to get the girl logistically into a place where things could get sexual as quickly as possible. So one day I realized that I wasn’t really escalating, I was sexcalating, because I was just making sex basically the overt and undertone of the interaction in a funny, socially acceptable way, and I&#8217;m going to teach you all about that today,</p>
<div id="attachment_33773" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 243px"><img class="size-full wp-image-33773" title="Calculate it!" src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/sexcal3.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="350" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Calculate it!</p></div>
<p>So Sexcalation is the idea of escalating the interaction verbally, physically and logistically towards sex with the idea of having sex with her overtly on the table. So that&#8217;s kind of one of the biggest things that I do that I think is different from a lot of guys out there in the community, is I think it&#8217;s okay to let the girl know that you&#8217;re trying to get her into bed.</p>
<p>I think a big mistake that guys make is they&#8217;re not overt enough with their intentions, and they think that if they just kind of talk about themselves, build commonalities, build rapport, build vulnerability, and tell the girls things they like about her, that eventually they just magically hop into bed, and unfortunately, for me, I never really got amazing, mind blowing results until I started bringing up the subject of sex and going sexual.</p>
<p>Just because you have attraction in an interaction, doesn’t necessarily mean you have sexual attraction; because you might have value-based or interest-based attraction.</p>
<p>You want to build sexual attraction first, and the way I like to do that is by teasing girls sexually. So the idea of teasing is pretty common idea, but what I did a couple years ago, was I re-tooled my game and went through and I chose everything that was more sexual and more kind of over the top, and I just wanted to see like, to what extremes I could go to, and I realized that you could go to some pretty far extremes once you&#8217;re pretty good at attraction.</p>
<p>So I started teasing girls sexually, I&#8217;d say things like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know who your last boyfriend is, but he obviously didn’t spank you enough.&#8221; Or I&#8217;d say things like, &#8220;Oh my God, you&#8217;re such a naughty girl.&#8221; Or, and I actually got this one from this crazy dude I knew, he went on this rant about he was going to be celibate and I turned it into kind of a fun role play that I do with girls. I&#8217;d say things like:</p>
<p>You know what, you girls are really cool, but we&#8217;re not having sex tonight because I&#8217;m fucking celibate. Yes, I think sex is for losers—for people who don’t have dreams and goals and ambitions; who don’t want to make the world a better place. It&#8217;s not for people like me, I&#8217;m a winner, that&#8217;s why fucking celibate. I’m over this sex thing, sex is for fucking losers. But you know what, it&#8217;s fucked up, because I&#8217;m telling you that now and like now you&#8217;re going to be all over me for the rest of the night. You&#8217;re going to be like, &#8220;Oh make out with me, because making out is okay, that doesn’t make you not celibate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then you&#8217;d be like, &#8220;Oh, come home with me. I&#8217;m going to get naked and get in bed with you, and then, you know, like an addict, like someone taking that first drink—I&#8217;d be back to that place where I&#8217;m a sexual addict. My life is filled with pain and misery, and everyone is just a pawn in my sexual game, but I won&#8217;t do it, not again. I&#8217;m going to be good. You stay away.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;ll keep going like for more than three of four minutes, but again, it&#8217;s introducing the idea of sex really early on in a funny fashion. Another thing I&#8217;ll do, I&#8217;ll be like,</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you guys are really nice but we&#8217;re not having sex. Girls are just using me for sex lately, like I am not just a human sausage. Like I&#8217;m definitely not, and yes, it is huge, but I&#8217;m not just here to be used like this. I have feelings and emotions and deep, deep thoughts, and I write poetry, like haikus. I wrote one today, it goes: Cat, mat, hat—isn&#8217;t that good? I&#8217;m not just a sexual thing; none of you guys is going to break through my shell. I&#8217;m sick of this—sick, tired of it.”</p>
<p>These teases are super fun and outrageous and will result in girls cracking up as you escalate the conversation towards sex.</p>
<p>In part 2, I’ll talk about how to physically sexcalate as well.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fathers &#8212; well, good ones, at least &#8212; have a role nearly as tough as the mothers when it comes to raising their kids. Sure, they don&#8217;t actually have to do the carrying of the child &#8212; which, really, there&#8217;s no comparison for that, because that&#8217;s a whole lot of sickness for a very long time &#8212; but in regards to their development as people, a father has to both be warm and nurturing while being a strict disciplinarian when need be. They are, in essence, both good cop and bad cop, depending on the circumstance. It&#8217;s truly a tough line to navigate, and one that a whole bunch of bad fathers have failed to do so. But, if you&#8217;re the son or daughter of a great father, then there&#8217;s no better day to show your appreciation than on the upcoming Father&#8217;s Day Hallmark-ish holiday celebration!</p>
<div id="attachment_33823" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><img class="size-medium wp-image-33823" title="Here you go, pops!" src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/father1-300x234.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="234" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Here you go, pops!</p></div>
<p>So today, we&#8217;re getting all paternal on your collective asses, by <a href="http://www.menshealth.com/best-life/fathers-day-gifts" rel="nofollow">highlighting this piece over at Men&#8217;s Health</a>about the greatest gifts that you could get your father for this Father&#8217;s Day. Among the gifts they are counting at the best out there:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Leatherman Rebar Tool</strong></p>
<p>One lesson all fathers try to pass along to their sons: how to be useful. Time to return the favor with the Leatherman Rebar Tool, which contains, among other things, a set of needlenose pliers, an electrical crimper, a pair of wire cutters, three screwdrivers, a bottle opener, and 10 other tools. The Rebar’s stainless steel pliers are stronger than the ones found on other models, and the wire-cutters are easy to replace if they ever wear out. At just four inches long, the Rebar’s also small enough for Dad to carry around in his pocket all the time. You’ll never open your own beer bottle ever again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems just about as &#8220;dadly&#8221; as you can get. Head on over to the link above to check out all of the numerous options for your father. And then, hey, if you want to purchase some of those yourself as well, well, you don&#8217;t need to be a father to want an awesome multi-tool thingy.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, you know what? Indian pop music is awesome. It&#8217;s bouncy and percussive and the music videos are choreographed to the level of mania. Over in the States, we&#8217;re stuck with 22-year-old rich ex-Disney Kids or art school graduates who act bored with music after their first year on the road. Indian pop music, by contrast, is joyous. Everyone from the always-bearded male singers to the attractive-yet-respectably-dressed female dancers looks like he or she is having the time of his or her life up there on stage. It&#8217;s a real breath of fresh air after growing up in a post-modern cultural footrace to see who can be more unimpressed and detached from everything.</p>
<p>I bring this up because there is an Indian pop singer who&#8217;s best known in American for one of his music videos going viral, but he turns out to be a pretty cool guy. So please allow some room in the Awesome Men Throughout History uber-palladium for Daler Mehndi.</p>
<p>Mehndi is a Bhangra pop singer (meaning he fuses folk music from his home country with Western instrumentation) as well as a playback singer for several Hindi movies. He&#8217;s best known in the States for the ridiculous video for “Tunak Tunak Tun,” which became an Internet sensation due to Mehndi&#8217;s slick dance moves and green screening – in fact, his was the first Indian music video to use a green screen.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/s9qvCTdBLDs" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe></p>
<p>Actually, the story behind that video is an interesting one; basically, Mehndi got tired of hearing that people only liked his music because of the beautiful women in his videos, so he made one where he dances with three digitally-inserted clones of himself who, in the video, fall to Earth from outer space. If there&#8217;s a better way to respond to critics, I&#8217;d like to hear it.</p>
<p>But all silliness aside, Mehndi is a well-trained singer and multi-instrumentalist who began training when he was six. He moved out to San Francisco as a young man, where he drove a cab for a while before going back to India to try his hand at a music career. His first solo album and subsequent record deals broke industry records in India, and I think he still holds the record for best-selling non-soundtrack over there, which is a pretty big deal. He&#8217;s even toured the United States before, which is something I wish I could have seen.</p>
<p>Mehndi is also something of a philanthropist, particularly when it comes to earthquake relief. Mehndi has built houses in areas damaged by earthquakes and did a concert series in Pakistan to raise money for victims. He&#8217;s also committed to reducing pollution in India, and has established the Daler Mehndi Green Drive to move native green efforts forward.</p>
<p>But even if you don&#8217;t agree with or care about what a do-gooder he is (although you should), one cannot help but give props to a guy who, despite being pudgy and middle-aged, became a wildly successful pop icon because of his talent and vision, and his unyielding commitment to having fun. I mean, just look at him go.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online dating is nothing but a SECONDARY mean of getting a few quick and easy lays. If you’re spending more than an hour a day on such sites something is definitely wrong and it would be a good idea to shut down your computer and go out into the real world to meet some REAL women.</p>
<p>While I agree that internet dating has some good parts and can sometimes yield in some decent hotties, here are 10 reasons why you shouldn’t take it too seriously and why real life dating is a much better option.</p>
<h2>1. Think you’re the only one? Think again</h2>
<p>If you’re talking to this one girl and you fall under the assumption that you might actually have something special going on there, don’t fool yourself. Many beautiful girls get over 100 chat requests per day and it can be incredibly difficult to create some sort of intimate bond when some many options are on the table.</p>
<p>A surprising amount of girls are using online dating for the exact same purposes men do, to get easy lays. It’s important to understand that you’re not really special when it comes to online dating and that’s why it’s always a good plan to avoid any sort of emotional involvement until things get physical.</p>
<h2>2. Why would she trust a random guy on the internet?</h2>
<p>You might find yourself chatting relentlessly to one woman only to convince her to go out with you on a real date. Sadly many of these girls never actually meet guys online and you’re only going to waste copious amounts of time chasing after them. It’s also quite difficult to judge which will be a time waster and which will pay off but either way be prepared to spend time chatting well into the late hours of the night…</p>
<h2>3. Women always look better in pictures</h2>
<p>I think it’s very uncommon for girls to look better in real life than in their online profile pictures, especially if their using online dating sites to meet men. When meeting a girl that you’ve been chatting online, be prepared for her to be “different” than her picture and it would be wise to lower your expectations accordingly.</p>
<p>Avoid girls that only have pictures of their faces, they’re usually fat. Girls that have a lot of make-up in pictures, usually have bad skin (and you will be able to tell in real life), if a girl has broad shoulders and pointy cheekbones then chances are she also has a penis.</p>
<p>You will also be stunned just how many women have pictures of their younger, slimmer days… I consider this a serious insult and if you ever end up meeting someone like this, consider turning your back and going home on the spot.</p>
<div id="attachment_33777" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 413px"><a href="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/onlinedatingseriousl2.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-33777 " title="That's about right ..." src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/onlinedatingseriousl2.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="270" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">That&#39;s about right ...</p></div>
<p>Sadly one of the biggest downers of online dating is the fact that you hardly get what you pay for.</p>
<h2>4. It’s hard to identify the crazies</h2>
<p>The online universe has and will always be a great place for disturbed weirdoes. Even if you think this girl is pretty normal, you could be totally wrong as she still keeps her ex’s head in a jar in the fridge. While it may be harder to spot the crazies online, if their doing any of the following think twice before going on a real date</p>
<blockquote><p>- She talks about herself in the 3rd person</p>
<p>- Her profile pictures are mostly cats</p>
<p>- Sh3 wRi7eS LyK DiS iN Ev3Ry sentence</p>
<p>- Has Justin Beiber in her profile photos</p></blockquote>
<h2>5. Nothing is real until you actually meet them</h2>
<p>You might find yourself having a great connection with a particular girl but in real life she could be a very obnoxious person. You can sometimes find yourself being attracted to the idea of the girl rather than the girl herself so it is best not to over commit until you actually have a real life date.</p>
<h2>6. Some girls just want attention</h2>
<p>Sadly dating sites are full of cockteasers. The truth is that many of the hot already have boyfriends or their insecure friends created them a profile and all they are interested is having a bunch of guys drooling over them for a massive confidence boost.</p>
<p>These girls actually think lowly of people that use online dating and you can normally spot them quickly by their lack of response towards you and inconsistencies in from conversations.</p>
<h2>7. Brace yourself – gay men like you too</h2>
<p>If you joined online dating sites expecting to be bombarded by a thousand requests from hot single hot women, think again because despite you setting your profile to STRAIGHT there seems to be a lot of strange homosexual men sending you friend requests.</p>
<p>If you’re committed to your online dating profile then brace yourself against the gay men that are going to contact you along with the occasional cock picture, we’ve all been there.</p>
<h2>8. Think you’re unique? Think again</h2>
<p>Considering the amount of men that are on dating sites, it’s almost impossible to appear unique. They are all nice, funny, outgoing etc so how can you stand out from the crowd?</p>
<p>You need some clever ways of appearing unique without ending up as weird, creepy or sleazy and when you’re doing this on the internet, it can become very frustrating.</p>
<h2>9. MILF’s with extras</h2>
<p>A recent study showed that internet dating is the most preferred option for young single mom’s. Having to raise a kid by themselves whilst working a full time job, there’s not much time left for dating so they often prefer to save time by putting down exactly what they prefer on their online dating profiles.</p>
<p>If you like MILF’s, you’re in luck but take care because most of them are on a mission and before you see what’s going on you have another guy’s kids calling you dad and a woman telling you she can’t make her mortgage.</p>
<h2>10. Your internet girlfriend might be trying to scam you</h2>
<p>Online dating scams are one of the most popular on the internet today and funny enough the majority of scammers seem to be from Nigeria. These people pose on dating sites as attractive men and women in order to lure desperate singles into sending them money.</p>
<p>It’s easy to spot them, if anyone is asking you to send them money before you even met them it’s pretty obvious that something dodgy must be going on. If you have a real connection with a girl but you still suspect she might be a con artist, ask her to cam with you and things should sort themselves out.</p>
<p>One last note, if you find yourself spending large amounts of time on online dating sites, you seriously have a problem and need to go out into the real world to meet some women.</p>
<p><em><strong>Real world dating is the sort of stuff I discuss on my blog and in the free eBook I give out.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The career trajectory of Jennifer Lopez will never cease to amaze me. I’m flabbergasted as I look at it now and think of all the promise and tell tale signs of future brilliance and how it all came to an end so quickly. After a four-year absence from movies, that career is just now starting to come back to life. Now, the question becomes, will it ever become good again?</p>
<div id="attachment_33791" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 440px"><img class=" wp-image-33791  " title="The hot J-Lo" src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/jlo2.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="323" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The hot J-Lo</p></div>
<p>First came her small role on “In Living Color” as a Fly Girl alongside future big screen stars like Jamie Foxx and Jim Carrey (as well as many Wayans who had already tasted more success.) Then came a great run of movies building to some pretty cool stuff, which I’ll cover below. Then came “Gigli” with fellow fallen star Ben Affleck while they were in the middle of what seemed like the first major internet covered superstar relationship. (Ugh, I just remembered the term, “Bennifer.”) While it’s been almost ten years, I look at Jennifer Lopez and still think, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vw9sQ98s9AE" rel="nofollow">“It’s turkey time.”</a>I don’t think I’ve seen a worse movie in theaters, though I admit, I don’t try anymore. That’s why I don’t go see any more Jennifer Lopez movies. If I start to think about going to a Jennifer Lopez movie, I think of those words and as of right now they make me sick so I don’t leave the house. Then, I plunge those words and the accompanying images out of my mind with her top five movies.</p>
<h2>5. Selena</h2>
<p>I’m not a big biopic fan and I’m not really a fan of Latin music, but holy Toledo, does Jennifer make this movie worth seeing. It makes me think of Gary Busey in “The Buddy Holly Story,” Jamie Foxx in “Ray” or Kurt Russell in “Elvis” and a great way to show your acting chops.</p>
<h2>4. Money Train</h2>
<p>Trying to cash in on the charisma that made “White Men Can’t Jump,” so successful, Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson made this movie and instead of Rosie Perez, it has Jennifer. Let’s just say it didn’t work nearly as well and leave it at that. However, for the first big action movie of a career, Jennifer could have done worse. (Think starring in “Battleship” or “John Carter.”)</p>
<h2>3. Anaconda</h2>
<p>Are there better horror films out there? Sure. Not everyone gets lucky like Jamie Lee Curtis to make “Halloween” as your first big horror movie. But, a giant snake and Jon Voight make this a very fun camp romp.</p>
<h2>2. The Cell</h2>
<p>Great? No, but it shows Jennifer’s willingness to take a chance with a movie that has some seriously wild and crazy visuals. “The Fall” is Tarsem’s better movie, but this one shows his visual style that he uses with a greatly improved story later.</p>
<h2>1. Out of Sight</h2>
<p>I thought George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez were going to have such great careers after this movie. Well, I was half right. When the rest of the cast includes Albert Brooks, Ving Rhames, Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman and Dennis Farina, I guess it can make anyone look good. It probably could have even worked with “What to Expect When You’re Expecting” or “Monster-in-Law.” Well, Jennifer, at least we’ll always have “Out of Sight.”</p>
<p>Agree? Disagree? Which movies would make your Jennifer Lopez top five?

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enjoy Independence Day, because a couple days later the dead shall walk the earth. In anticipation of the series’ third season, AMC will air all 19 episodes from the critically acclaimed zombie TV series “The Walking Dead.”</p>
<div id="attachment_33796" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 402px"><img class=" wp-image-33796 " title="Walk, you dead!" src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/walkdead2.jpg" alt="" width="392" height="231" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Walk, you dead!</p></div>
<p>According to <a href="http://blogs.amctv.com/the-walking-dead/2012/05/the-walking-dead-preview-weekend.php" rel="nofollow">“The Walking Dead” blog</a>, AMC is set to air a “Walking Dead” marathon on Saturday July 7 and Sunday July 8. Every episode from the series’ first two seasons will air, starting each day at 11:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Chris Hardwick, host of the live talk show “Talking Dead,” will introduce each episode from the series’ Atlanta set. Hardwick, along with cast members and producers, will set up every episode and highlight key moments in each. AMC will also air behind-the-scenes footage and sit-down interviews with the cast during the 19-episode run.</p>
<p>Following the marathon, AMC will air an hour-long “Talking Dead” episode.  The show will feature a sneak preview of a season three scene, a tour of the set, interviews with celebrity fans and much more.</p>
<p>Fans of the comic book on which the series is based are in for a treat as well. AMC will be airing a black-and-white version of its pilot episode after the live “Talking Dead” event, styled after the comic.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a series noob or you own a homemade “I Hate Shane” T-shirt, consider checking out some of the marathon. If you’re new to the series and have no life, you can watch every episode and catch up with everyone else. For those of you who’ve grown as tired as Rick’s stupid kid as much as me, it’ll be cool to see it over again as well as get a glimpse at next season.  Noob or not, you’ll be able to catch the start of season three in October.</p>

<p>Well, not just because. She DOES have a new movie coming out this week, entitled Snow White and the Huntsman, which looks, oh, let&#8217;s say kind of trippy? Full of colors? Charlize Theron playing off her normal hotness by being a stone cold bitch this time? Sure. All of those things. It does look interesting, but really, without Ms. Theron in the lead role, the interest level of this movie would easily be knocked down about 40 pegs. And there&#8217;s only 50 pegs on the ladder! Which is all to say, here&#8217;s a gallery of the lovely Charlize Theron, yes because she&#8217;s in this movie, but mostly because she is Charlize Theron, and sometimes that&#8217;s reason enough.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All my life I’ve been immature. This became forebodingly clear when I was in 6<sup>th</sup> grade, and my friend Will and I threw a massive spitball at the head of our social studies teacher as she turned around to write something on the chalkboard.</p>
<div id="attachment_33746" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 470px"><img class="size-full wp-image-33746" title="Adios!" src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/goodbye.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="276" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Adios!</p></div>
<p>Since her back was turned, she didn’t actually catch us in the act, yet she was determined to crucify the guilty parties. “Here’s what we’re going to do!” she screamed at the class, “Everyone is going to take out a piece of paper and anonymously write the names of who threw…who threw…this disgusting thing!” She pointed to the wet spitball, sagged across the floor like my hopes of getting away unscathed.</p>
<p>My classmates snapped to attention, scribbling down Will’s and my guilt with freshly sharpened, number two pencils. The papers were collected and read out loud, with a final tally of 28 votes for Will and I, one vote for Abraham Lincoln, and one for aliens.</p>
<p>Will and I were marched out into the hall, and before we were sent down to the principals’ office (who later suspended us), our irate teacher shrieked at us, told us that were immature little boys, and that if we didn’t grow up real fast that we were going to lead very, <em>very</em> miserable lives.</p>
<p>I didn’t learn my lesson—not then, not 20 years later.</p>
<p>I’m immature because I find it hard to move on with my life. I don’t live in the past, but I do live in the present. Often the life I know is the life I enjoy, so I avoid change as much as I can. Throwing spitballs and acting like a wiseass was a lifestyle I loved back when I was kid. The problem was, by 6<sup>th</sup> grade, most kids were beyond that stuff (which was probably why not a single one of those motherfuckers covered for Will and I!).</p>
<p>Every major change I had to make in life was forced upon me—never chosen. I “grew up” when I went off to high school because I started an entire new life, in a new school, with a new group of friends. I entered “adulthood” when I went off to college, again starting all over at a new school and with new friends.</p>
<p>I later got involved with the dating advice scene because I moved to New York City, knew no one, and wanted to alleviate my pain of loneliness. I’d just turned 24 when I started that “journey.” Five years later, I look back on my “dating advice era” as the most enjoyable years of my life.</p>
<p>I met hundreds—if not thousands—of awesome, new people. I had crazy adventures. I helped people improve the quality of their lives. I attained a lifestyle of freedom and fun that I couldn’t have even fathomed only a few short years ago. Cliché as it sounds, my life really became one big party…and I enjoyed the fuck out of every moment.</p>
<p>I wrapped myself in this cocoon of fun and carelessness, never wanting to leave. I often bragged that I’d “graduated the real world” and was overturning the old cliché that youth is wasted on the young.</p>
<p>I was immature, and it was awesome.</p>
<p>Then, as it always happens, change was forced upon me: I met a girl. Out of respect for her, I don’t want divulge too much about her or our relationship other than to say this girl represented everything I’d ever wanted in a woman, and that I feel she’s the person I’m meant to be with.</p>
<p>However, when she discovered my body of work in the dating advice niche, her reaction brought back memories of my social studies teacher reading the riot act to Will and I out in that hallway. Except this time, I wasn’t getting warned that my life was going to be very, <em>very</em> miserable if I didn’t grow up. No. This time, my life actually became very, <em>very</em> miserable when I got dumped because I <em>hadn’t</em> grown up.</p>
<p>The obvious irony of having my relationship ruined over dating advice was certainly not lost on me. Though, neither was the realization that I needed to grow the fuck up. Since much of my writing and advice came from experiences and epiphanies I had in my mid-twenties, I sort of insulated myself from growing older.</p>
<p>Every time I sat down to write a new article, prepare a new speech, or do anything as “Rob, the Pickup Instructor,” I was doing it as my 24-year-old self. Don’t get me wrong: this was wildly fun at first. Yet, after a while, it felt like I was in that movie <em>Groundhogs’ Day</em>. I wasn’t growing, just repeating. Repeating. And repeating.</p>
<p>While the values and interests I had at 24 worked for me then, I’m certainly not the same person anymore. Or at least I don’t want to continue to be that person. Life is about evolving and challenging yourself to push beyond your boundaries and comfort zone, yet having to continually “bring back” my 24-year-old self kept me on a treadmill of mediocrity. I have big dreams, and those dreams were being put on hold indifferently by my immaturity, by my refusal to grow up.</p>
<p>Yet, had I not had a wake up call, I probably wouldn’t have made a change. When I saw the things I’d done as Rob through the eyes of someone I care about, and saw how much of a disconnect there was between the person I’m trying to become (which is the person she got to know) and the person who’s portrayed on the internet (which is the person I was years ago), I knew it was time to change.</p>
<p>Hard as it’s going to be, I need to change.</p>
<p>Dating advice may have helped me graduate from the real world, but now it’s time for me for graduate from dating advice. It had its place once upon a time, but now I need to step away. I appreciate everyone who’s read my articles, considered my viewpoints, and allowed me the opportunity to help you better understand women and dating.</p>
<p>Thank you for everything. And goodbye.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She’s all too happy to go to your place, but never lets you come over to hers. Is she hiding something?</p>
<h2>She could be cheating on her live-in partner</h2>
<div id="attachment_33784" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 460px"><img class="size-full wp-image-33784" title="What it means" src="http://www.tsbmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/girlsplace2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">What it means</p></div>
<p>The worst case scenario is that she won’t let you come over because she lives with the husband or boyfriend that she neglected to tell you about. Look for other warning signs, such as not letting you meet her friends, being precious about her phone and not wanting to be linked with you on social networks.</p>
<h2>She’s embarrassed about how her home looks</h2>
<p>She’s hiding something from you &#8211; but it’s not a husband. Her reason for not letting you come over might not be so malicious. It could be down to her being ashamed about where she lives.</p>
<p>If she never even lets you take her home and will not divulge her address, she could be embarrassed about where she lives. She doesn’t want you to find out she lives in a house which resembles a shack, or in an area with a bad reputation. Another possibility is that she is ashamed of how messy her house is, especially if she has problems with hoarding. This is particularly likely if you live in a nice place- she’ll be embarrassed by prospect of comparison.</p>
<h2>She’s ashamed that she lives with her parents</h2>
<p>Perhaps she’s boasted to you about her amazing apartment, but has forgotten to mention something: she still lives with mom and dad. You can understand why she’d be embarrassed about it, especially if your home situation is completely different. But this is one of those secrets which has to come out sooner or later- so it’s not much to worry about.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that she has a housemate which she has failed to mention. The only reason why this would make her ashamed is if she’s lied about how rich she is, and does not want to admit she can’t afford to live on her own. If you suspect this is the case, you could drop hints about how lonely she must be on her own- that way she can mention the housemate, and claim that her reason for having one is companionship.</p>
<h2>How to deal with it</h2>
<p>You’ll never find out why she’s not letting you come over if you don’t ask. But once she’s told you, set a small time period in which she will bring you to her place. If she keeps holding it off despite confiding the reason she doesn’t want you there, you can be sure she’s hiding a bigger secret than she lets on.</p>
<p>There’s not much you can do if she is genuinely embarrassed about her place. It’s up to her to get over it. You can encourage this by bringing up the issue of her not letting you come over, and telling her that it doesn’t worry you if her place is messy or inhabited by parents. Hopefully she will confide why she’s embarrassed.</p>
<p>Beware that lots of people do use the excuse of embarrassment to cover for their infidelity. If she’s admitted that she’s embarrassed but still won’t let you come over, she probably lied.
