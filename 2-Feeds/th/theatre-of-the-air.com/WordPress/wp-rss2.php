<p class="mceTemp" style="text-align: left;"><em>(A woman awakes to a world she does not know.)</em></p>
<p class="mceTemp" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Harold Pinter</strong> (1930-2008) was an English playwright who achieved international success as one of the most complex post-World War II dramatists. Pinter&#8217;s plays are noted for their use of silence to increase tension, understatement, and cryptic small talk. Equally recognizable are the themes: nameless menace, erotic fantasy, obsession and jealousy, family hatred and mental disturbance. After years as an actor in provincial <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1684" title="pinter-small" src="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/pinter-small.jpg" alt="pinter-small" width="87" height="101" />repertory theatre under the pseudonym David Baron, Pinter began to write for the stage. <em>The Room</em> (1957), originally written for Bristol University&#8217;s drama department, was finished in four days. His first full-length play, <em>The Birthday Party</em>, was produced in 1958 in the West End and closed after disastrous reviews, but Harold Hobson wrote, “Mr. Pinter, on the evidence of this work, possesses the most original, disturbing and arresting talent in theatrical London.” In more than 30 plays &#8211; written between 1957 and 2000 and including masterworks like <em>The Birthday Party</em>, <em>The Caretaker</em>, <em>The Homecoming</em> and <em>Betrayal</em> &#8211; Mr. Pinter captured the anxiety and ambiguity of life in the second half of the 20th century with terse, hypnotic dialogue filled with gaping pauses and the prospect of imminent violence. In 2005, Pinter was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Along with another Nobel winner, Samuel Beckett, his friend and mentor, Mr. Pinter became one of the few modern playwrights whose names instantly evoke a sensibility. The adjective Pinteresque has become part of the cultural vocabulary as a byword for strong and unspecified menace. He was also publicly outspoken in his views on repression and censorship, at home and abroad. Pinter died of esophogeal cancer on Christmas Eve, 2008.</p>

Because of some of her associations and causes, she was listed as a Communist by the publication Red Channels in 1950. As a result, she was placed on the Hollywood blacklist by the movie studio bosses. From 1957 to 1962 she wrote book reviews for Esquire. Parker died of a heart attack at the age of 73 in 1967. She bequeathed her estate to the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. foundation; following King&#8217;s death, her estate passed to the NAACP. Her ashes remained unclaimed in various places, including her attorney Paul O&#8217;Dwyer&#8217;s filing cabinet, for approximately 17 years. In 1988, the NAACP claimed Parker&#8217;s remains and designed a memorial garden for them outside their Baltimore headquarters.

<p class="mceTemp" style="text-align: left;"><strong>O. Henry, </strong>pseudonym of William Sydney Porter (1862-1910), was an American writer of short stories, best known for his ironic plot twists and surprise endings. Born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina, O. Henry did not write professionally until he reached his mid-30s. In 1894 he<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1299" title="o-henry-small" src="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/o-henry-small.jpg" alt="o-henry-small" width="71" height="90" /> founded a short-lived weekly humor magazine, The Rolling Stone. In 1896 O. Henry was charged with embezzling funds from the First National Bank of Austin, Texas, where he had worked from 1891 to 1894. He served three years of a five-year sentence at the federal penitentiary in Columbus, Ohio, where he first began to write short stories and use the pseudonym O. Henry. During the last ten years of his life, O. Henry became one of the most popular writers in America, publishing over 500 short stories in dozens of widely read periodicals. &#8220;Gifts of the Magi&#8221; (our current podcast) is one of his best-known works.<br />
<strong><br />
Truman Capote</strong>, (1924-1984) was an American writer whose short stories, novels, plays and non-fiction are recognized literary classics, including the novella <em>Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s</em> (1958) and <em>In Cold Blood</em> (1965), which he labeled a &#8220;non-fiction novel&#8221;. At least 20 films and television dramas have been produced from Capote novels, stories and screenplays. When he was four, his parents divorced, and he was sent to <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1285" title="capote-small" src="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/capote-small.jpg" alt="capote-small" width="76" height="92" />Monroeville, AL, where he was raised by his mother&#8217;s relatives. He formed a fast bond with his mother&#8217;s distant relative, Nanny Rumbley Faulk, whom Truman called &#8216;Sook&#8217;. As a lonely child, Capote taught himself to read and write before he entered the first grade in school. At 17, Capote ended his formal education and began a two-year job at The New Yorker magazine. Between 1943 and 1946, he wrote a continual flow of short fiction. Capote remained a lifelong friend of his Monroeville neighbor Harper Lee, and he based the character of Idabel in <em>Other Voices, Other Rooms</em> on her. After the success of <em>In Cold Blood</em>, Capote&#8217;s publisher re-released his earlier works, including a 20th anniversary edition of <em>Other Voices, Other Rooms</em> and a holiday gift book edition of his 1956 story &#8220;A Christmas Memory&#8221; (our current podcast). In the late 1970s, Capote was in and out of rehab clinics, and news of his various breakdowns frequently reached the public. Capote died in Los Angeles, CA at the home of his old friend Joanne Carson, ex-wife of late-night TV host Johnny Carson, on whose program Capote had been a frequent guest. According to the coroner&#8217;s report the cause of death was &#8220;liver disease complicated by phlebitis and multiple drug intoxication.&#8221;</p>

(Stories of love and of childhood memory for the holiday season)
O. Henry, pseudonym of William Sydney Porter (1862-1910), was an American writer of short stories, best known for his ironic plot twists and surprise endings. Born and raised in Greensboro, North Carolina, O. Henry did not write professionally until he reached his mid-30s. In 1894 he(http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/o-henry-small.jpg) founded a short-lived weekly humor magazine, The Rolling Stone. In 1896 O. Henry was charged with embezzling funds from the First National Bank of Austin, Texas, where he had worked from 1891 to 1894. He served three years of a five-year sentence at the federal penitentiary in Columbus, Ohio, where he first began to write short stories and use the pseudonym O. Henry.

<p class="mceTemp" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Noel Coward</strong> (1899-1973), English playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, director, novelist, painter, had no more than a few years&#8217; elementary school education, but by early adulthood was recognized on both sides of the Atlantic as the personification of wit and sophistication. After he enjoyed some moderate success with<a href="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/noel-coward.jpg" ><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-894" title="noel-coward" src="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/noel-coward.jpg" alt="" width="105" height="135" /></a> <em>The Young Idea</em> in 1923, the controversy surrounding his play <em>The Vortex</em> (1924), which contains many veiled references to drug abuse and homosexuality, made him an overnight sensation on both sides of the Atlantic. There followed three more hits: <em>Hay Fever</em>, <em>Fallen Angels</em> and <em>Easy Virtue</em>. Much of Coward&#8217;s best work came in the late 1920s and early 1930s: the operetta <em>Bitter Sweet</em>; <em>Cavalcade</em>; <em>Private Lives</em>; <em>Design for Living</em>; and <em>Tonight at 8:30</em>, a cycle of ten short plays, one of which, <em>Still Life</em>, was expanded into the 1945 film &#8220;Brief Encounter.&#8221;<br />
He was also a prolific writer of popular songs, including &#8220;I&#8217;ll See You Again,&#8221;<em> &#8220;M</em>ad Dogs and Englishmen<em>,&#8221;</em> &#8220;The Stately Homes of England,&#8221; and &#8220;(Don&#8217;t Put Your Daughter on the Stage) Mrs.Worthington<em>.&#8221;<br />
</em>The ascendence in England in the 1950s of harsh, realistic drama such as John Osborne&#8217;s <em>Look Back in Anger</em> saw a sharp decline in Coward&#8217;s popularity, but the 1960s witnessed his revival. <em>A Song At Twilight</em> (our current podcast) &#8211; one of Coward&#8217;s last works &#8211; may be thought to be his response to mounting criticism that throughout his career he had avoided addressing his own sexual nature. Coward was knighted in 1970, and died in Jamaica in March 1973 of heart failure..</p>

A Song At Twilight (Act I), by Noel Coward (Comedy-Drama)
Starring George Backman, Sylvia Short, Gretchen Evans and Jason Campbell
[Playing Time:46:05]
(A world-famous author&#039;s former lover appears after 20 years. Why?)
Noel Coward (1899-1973), English playwright, composer, lyricist, actor, singer, director, novelist, painter, had no more than a few years&#039; elementary school education, but by early adulthood was recognized on both sides of the Atlantic as the personification of wit and sophistication. After he enjoyed some moderate success with (http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/noel-coward.jpg)The Young Idea in 1923, the controversy surrounding his playThe Vortex (1924), which contains many veiled references to drug abuse and homosexuality, made him an overnight sensation on both sides of the Atlantic.

<p class="mceTemp" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Anton Chekhov</strong> (1860-1904), playwright, is also considered to be one of the greatest short-story writers in world literature. He was born the son of a grocer and grandson of a serf in<a href="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/chekhov.jpg" ><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-724" title="chekhov" src="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/chekhov.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="139" /></a> Russia. He began writing short stories during his days as a medical student at the University of Moscow. His first career was as a writer of humorous material; he began contributing to minor magazines in 1880. His reputation grew when he published his first story collection <em>Motley Stories; </em>in 1888, his next collection <em>In the Twilight</em> won the Pushkin Prize. Chekhov practiced as a doctor throughout most of his literary career: &#8220;Medicine is my lawful wife,&#8221; he once said, &#8220;and literature is my mistress.&#8221;<br />
His early dramas <em>Ivanov</em> and <em>The Wood Demon</em> were fairly unsuccessful. After the disastrous reception of <em>The Seagull</em> in 1896 Chekhov renounced the theatre; but the play was revived to acclaim in 1898 by Constantin Stanislavski&#8217;s Moscow Art Theatre, which subsequently also produced <em>Uncle Vanya</em> and premiered Chekhov’s last two plays, <em>Three Sisters</em> and <em>The Cherry Orchard, </em>establishing these works as dramatic masterpieces. During his final years, he was forced to live in exile from the intellectuals of Moscow. In 1904, he died of tuberculosis in a German health resort. Since his death, Chekhov&#8217;s plays have become famous worldwide and he has come to be considered the greatest Russian storyteller and dramatist of modern times.</p>

<p><strong>Václav Havel (</strong>1936 &#8211; 2011) was a Czech playwright, writer and politician. He was the tenth and last President<a href="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/havel-2.jpg" ><img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-620" title="havel-2" src="http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/havel-2.jpg" alt="" width="116" height="143" /></a> of Czechoslovakia (1989-1992) and the first President of the Czech Republic (1993-2003). He has written more than twenty plays and numerous non-fiction works, translated internationally. His first publicly performed full-length play, <em>The Garden Party</em> (1963), won him international acclaim and was soon followed by <em>The Memorandum</em> and <em>The Increased Difficulty of Concentration</em>. After 1968 his plays were banned in his own country and Havel was unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances.<br />
In 1977, his involvement with the human rights manifesto <em>Charter 77</em> brought him international fame and led to his imprisonment. Similar political activity resulted in multiple prison stays &#8211; the longest being four years &#8211; and also subjected him to constant government surveillance and harassment. (Compare the character Vanek in our current podcast.) The 1989 &#8220;Velvet Revolution,&#8221; the bloodless end to Communism in Czechoslovakia, launched Havel into that country&#8217;s presidency, a role in which he led it and later the Czech Republic to multi-party democracy. He has received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Philadelphia Liberty Medal and the Ambassador of Conscience Award.<br />

Production 13:
Protest, by Václav Havel (Drama)
Starring William Smithers and Richard Hoag
[Playing Time: 45:31]
(In a country where Big Brother is always watching, why would a successful media big-shot seek out an ex-con dissident?)
Václav Havel (1936 - 2011) was a Czech playwright, writer and politician. He was the tenth and last President(http://theatre-of-the-air.com/WordPress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/havel-2.jpg) of Czechoslovakia (1989-1992) and the first President of the Czech Republic (1993-2003). He has written more than twenty plays and numerous non-fiction works, translated internationally. His first publicly performed full-length play, The Garden Party (1963), won him international acclaim and was soon followed by The Memorandum and The Increased Difficulty of Concentration. After 1968 his plays were banned in his own country and Havel was unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances.
In 1977, his involvement with the human rights manifesto Charter 77 brought him international fame and led to his imprisonment. Similar political activity resulted in multiple prison stays - the longest being four years - and also subjected him to constant government surveillance and harassment. (Compare the character Vanek in our current podcast.) The 1989 &quot;Velvet Revolution,&quot; the bloodless end to Communism in Czechoslovakia, launched Havel into that country&#039;s presidency, a role in which he led it and later the Czech Republic to multi-party democracy. He has received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Philadelphia Liberty Medal and the Ambassador of Conscience Award.
Havel died on 18 December 2011, aged 75, at his country home in Hradecek.  Former U.S. Secretary of State Madelaine Albright, a native of Czechoslovakia, said, &quot;He was one of the great figures of the 20th Century&quot;, while Czech expatriate novelist Milan Kundra said, &quot;Václav Havel&#039;s most important work is his own life.&quot;
