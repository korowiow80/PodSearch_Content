<itunes:summary>We take pop culture, and skewer it with a pitchfork.  We then drive a white hot rod through it, and roast it over a spit, with God at one end and Satan at the other turning it slowly for eternity.  We also review movies straight from the bargain bin.  It's it's cheap, we review it.  Whether good or bad, mostly bad, as long as it's inexpensive, we're on it.  Look to us for current, sometimes not so current, events that you want to listen to us rip on.  It's a jolly good time, and everyone should absolutely be in on this.  </itunes:summary>

<description>What do you get when you put four geeks into an enclosed space with too much sugar and caffiene?  A violent outburst, or in some cases a Podcast about all things geeky and/or nerdy.</description>

<itunes:summary>Episode 11 truly does go to 11 when it spirals viciously out of control and we learn a little too much about a darker side of The Commish!  The Medium Bus Podcast Crew becomes angry when an imposter shows up instead of their scheduled guest, Paul from the movie "Paul."  We discuss sequels, prequels, and reboots, then review a movie that was so horrible it was packaged with a barf bag!  All this, and more deliciousness for your ears in Episode 11.

Welso have another look at movies in theatres this Summer as well as a discussion on sequels.  And then speaking of sequels, we review a movie that should have never been made.  Or really, maybe the original should have never been made?  Better yet, perhaps this movie should have been the original with the same budget as the original.  Regardless, it's a train wreck.  Enjoy at your leisure.

<itunes:summary>You can pretty much just leave mustard sitting around un-refrigerated for just about any length of time.  But, if you mixed ketchup and mustard together, would it ever go bad?  God only knows, and so do we.  Is the CDC trying to frighten us with the threat of a zombie apocalypse?  Watch out in South CEntral Los Angeles if you're deaf, seriously.  How does a grown man lose a fight to a cat?  A HOUSECAT!?  How much should your buyout be for a toddler on E-Bay?  We review a book entitled "The Dead Infested: Second Bane" by Edward J. Russell, @LordDward (contrary to Dusty's mis-spelling verbatim) on twitter.  Also, visit www.thedeadinfested.com to get info on how to order the book.  Then we review a movie that was pretty super, indeed.  Enjoy!

Noire, while Jeff can't get past it being a rental only.  Do we spend a little too much time making love to Rockstar Games?  Maybe, maybe not.  Maybe they'll file a restraining order against us for being all up on them?  We cap this one off with a movie that was near and dear to us as young nerds.  how does The Wizard hold up?  Tune in to find out.

Recorded documentation puts Jeff in a bind.  It's amazing what he'd do for scant amounts of money.  Speaking of which, what would the rest of us do for a given amount of money?  Dusty would become Robocop if he could.  Everyone stock up on baby food so he can accomplish that goal.  We also review Howard The Duck, a cult classic.  What did we think?  Listen and find out.

The Medium Bus investigates other possible mistresses.  What would any one of us do for $10 million, you might be surprised.  The show starts with a growl and ends with a movie about an animal that growls.  It's amazing, and it's intense.  Enjoy.

This may be our last visit to Days of the Dead.  Are 3D movies on the way out the door?  We certainly hope so.  We review a movie worse than Bear.  Enjoy.

The Commish reminds that you don't give no freebies out to no trick.  And Dusty reminds The Commish on how the birds and the bee's work.  Why would anyone try and stop a woman from doing her chores?  How furious does it make someone when they can't finish their ice cream cake?  What is Crunk Energy Drink made of?  Sizzurp and meth!  Why are super hero movies not doing well?  The Medium Bus discusses, and tells you exactly why!  Would George Lucas really hurt our feelings again with another trilogy?  We review The Crow: Wicked Prayer, hope you don't hate he review as much as we hated the movie.

Local news doesn't always make us proud.  But we have a story about a real Indiana hero for you.  What happened to Amy Whinehouse?  The Medium Bus answers your unasked questions.  What would be better than kids singing some Cypress HIll?  Not much.  Seriously, how epic would it be?  Despite what you may have learned from children's books, Canada is not a block of ice year round.  Be careful not to leave the house for anything at all, except to come see us at Gen-Con August 4th thru 7th.  We review a movie that will be showing at the convention written and directed by a near Indy local.  Enjoy.

In this first episode we talk a little about some of the sights, sounds, and games we played.  Among the interviews is author, Ed Russell, who's book we reviewed: The Dead Infested.  We also talk to the creator of the deck building game Eaten By Zombies, Max Holliday.  We then talk to Wizards of the Coast representative Shelly Mazzanoble about a lot of the new Dungeons and Dragons products coming to you very soon.  There was too much stuff to fit into one episode, so make sure you tune in next week for the exciting conclusion.

We also review some games.  And then, to top it all off, ew talk about a movie starring the unwavering James Van Der Beek.  It's an incredible time, and you should think so too.

Gladiators may not really be gladiators, so do NOT have your picture taken with them.  It's unreasonable what dolphins wash up on shore wrapped in.  The Commish hates Summer, and it becomes exactly how apparent that is.  But we talk about what was awesome about our Summer, and upcoming movies and games to look out for.  All this and more in Episode 31!

Is there a deleted scene from Earnest Goes to Jail that The Commish found on the directors cut blu-ray?  And, in an unprecendented Broad Talk, we get to "Ask a Broad."  Learn everything you've EVER wanted to know about a woman.  Then we review a brand spanking new movie by our candidate for biggest bad ass after Chuck Norris and the guy that plays Little Finger on Game of Thrones, called Blitz.

Vampires are real, and they're hanging around abandoned Hooters restaurants.  They're also biting chunks out of homless people as opposed to merely sucking their blood.  Is it unfair to force a man in a wheelchair to make his own way to the top of Pike's Peak?  Or is he actually volunteering himself to roll uphill?  The Medium Bus finally does some charity work for a web site called "Porn For the Blind."  We do everything we can, because we care.  We then discuss which women each of us would like to fight.  We then discuss a horendous movie called, The Chaperone.

We present the conundrum of having two lesbian mothers, with one of them being hot.  A new video game is set to revolutionize how we look at and feel about attacks on women.  Does teh discussion about nasty candy go on too long?  No, you can never be "too" informed about that kind of thing.  The Commish reviews Dead Island, which is as good as he says it is.  We then proceed to pick apart and destroy a list of 250 "must see" movies, and add our own.  Of course we're torn in our own lists, but there are definitely areas where we agree.  Then we review a movie that perhaps should never make a list of any movie to see.

Steve Jobs died.  Sad day for those who use Apple products.  PC users rejoice!!  All men, and some lesbians have adams apples?  Or no lesbians have adams apples?  Not sure.  How far will you go to get revenge on the guy making fun of your man boobs?  Harsh words?  Murder?  How manly are you really, if you can tear a leg from a chair before beating someone to death with it?  Is it okay to go from one news story, to a completely different one, and then directly back to the pervious story?  Cats are still attempting to take over the world.  Johnny Depp is under attack from multiple rapists.  HOW MUCH are they making?  We're of course referring to The Simpsons voice actors.  Nancy Grace farted!!  And The Bus is divided, severely, when we review Antichrist.

The Medium Bus is broken down and we're stranded at a haunted house.  Episode one of our haunted adventure features no Commish, but news galore.  We discuss our favorite horror villians, and try not to wet ourselves from the fear inducing horros happening in the background.  We want to really thank Haunts of Hidden River Inc. for having us out for this.  It was a great joy, and we wish them all kinds of luck.  They are a not for profit organization, volunteer run, and all proceeds go back into the community.  Follow them on twitter @HHRinc and find them on Facebook.  You can also visit their web site at www.hauntsofhiddenriver.com  The movie for this week is Cronos, a Guillermo Del Toro movie that leaves the bus divided once again.

We have a proposal for the best reality show that could ever exist.  How can a hook-up on Craig's List really ruin your life?  If you already have a girlfriend.  And also if you're trolling for chicks on Craig's List.  A man gets caught doing what?  With a donkey?  Really?  And I had to pay for it when I saw it?  After we drop some knowledge on you, we review 13 Assassins.

Does anything good come out of Pennsylvania aside from Amish food?  What's worse than a human centipede?  A human elkipede!!  Park Place, one of the best properties in Monopoly, is worth committing murder to acquire it.  We then do a full audio review of a game we played at Gen Con, Eaten By Zombies.  And then we review an entirely new game, The Legend of Drizzt.  And to top it all off, we divde the bus when we review Trollhunter.

A question from twitter asks, and we answer, whether The Commish is black. We also shout out to our newest podcasting homies, Game of Bro's.  Look them up on iTunes, and visit their web site.  The Medium Bus approves.  How can you catch a crook in England?  Offer them some beer.  Offer them beer and then send them to a prison in Mexico so they can party with some weed, prostitutes, and cock fights!  What does a reboot of Ninja Turtles need?  A topless Scarlett Johansson!  The Commish and Dusty then discuss projects they used to work on as kids.  Which Windows operating system is best?  We then introduce a new section to the podcast, Commishisms.  Then we review Tron: Legacy

We go trolling Craigs List for some Missed Connections and try to help them out.  Is that a cat?  We determine it's an excellent idea to hang out around Steak n Shake around dinner time on senior day?  We then answer some questions in another segment of Commishisms.  This time Dusty write's a novel though during the question answering portion.  What has Steve Guttenberg been up to?  Find out in this episode, the most comprehensive source of Police Academy information on the internet.  Not sure if we have ever Googled this much during one of our episodes.  Then we have another bus divided on the holiday horror movie, Thankskilling.

We then explore some Commishisms with idiots on a popular Q and A site.  To top it all off, we listen to a voicemail we received and read a text message.  Our rate of growth is immense.  We then stop and smell the Rose McGowan in Conan 2011.

What is required to have an actual circle of life?  not two dudes according to The Commish.  What does it take to convince people to rate us on iTunes?  What are expensive electronics used for in third world countries?  We discuss a couple of movie trailers that at the time Dusty did not see, because of his stupid internet problem.  Canadian money is worthless, eh.  Since when do the Amish live off the government?  What is the most brilliant idea for getting off of work for a short period of time?  Is there one holiday to rule them all?  Yes, it's one solid week of holiday festivities once a month, per The Medium Bus.  How do you handle one of those relatives that just sits, drinks gravy and drippings straight from the pan, and also won't get out of a chair for which you have already called "dibs?"  We nerd out over Star Wars for a little too long.  As our Christmas gift to all of you, we give you some ideas for really bad gifts.  We then review and agree whole-heartedly about, Santa's Slay.  Merry Christmas!

Scissoring, speedbaggin' and a punch WHERE?  Fatten up your girl by taking her out to Denny's.  It takes more than a push-up bra to make a dude hot.  What makes a good face surgery?  Nothing was better this year than the birth of The Medium Bus, but we talk about some things that we did like.  Which ones did we hate the most?   And which ones would we rate differently?  I that a Pringle's can in Willem Defoe's pocket, or is he just in a movie we watched earlier this year?  We answer a couple of questions for some people to end the year.  And then we end things on a glorious note when we review a short film, Treevenge.  Happy New Year!

How many Contra games were there?  Dusty plants on starting a band that does only music from and inspired by the video game Contra.  And is it possible to build a whole person just out of NES game body parts that were used as end bosses?  The Commish does not not approve of the newest Castlevania.  It appears that faithbook.com is an actual web site.  If you're eating cocaine, does it really matter where you eat it from if it's going to kill you regardless?  If the Emperor was cloned, how likely would it be the Dark Side would dominate the entire universe?  Some of us used to run around and play in stores, but some people attack others with light sabres.  How can you make your own light sabre at home?  We can sort of teach you.  How much space does a 5 1/4" floppy disk hold?  How long can we discuss it?  Who cares.  We start the year off right when we review Humble Pie.

We start the year off on the right foot with some really uplifting stories.  Those darned college kids are up to again also.  How far would Dusty go to see pictures of Scarlett Johannsen?  We have a round table discussion that Dusty really doesn't want to have.  Google translates some voicemail for us, and it is strange.  The Commish suggests a theory that it's not being translated by a computer, but by foreigners.  The Commish answers some stuff for us with Commishisms.  Poor Dick Clark.  Then we review a movie starring Alec Baldwin, the guy at the top of our Baldwin Scale.  The Edge.  And then we rate our first year as a podcast.

The Commish wants some salvia.  Is it still legal in your state?  Do you prefer a woman with no hair and big breasts or small breasts and a full head of hair?  We discuss extensively.  Trust me, it makes a difference that it's a personal choice, for some of us.  A male contortionist steals a police car after he's already in cuffs.  Hyjinks ensue at a North Carolina Wal-Mart as they cannot change a large bill.  A merging of species is part of that.  What are the advantages of taking large bills to a strip club?  Is there more meat in roadkill than food from Taco Bell?  Does The Medium Bus need a monstrous dictator as a mascot?  What's a good gift to give to the Pope?  There's an epidemic spreading in North Korea.  It's a problem called Canine Diabetes.  Also, how are they going to manage when we start taxing them for being hungry?  And have we unlocked our full potential when we watch and rate Limitless?

The Commish answers some questions for us.  And then we review a movie.  Winter's Bone.

And are accents too terrible for the air.  Super Bowl Picks!  And we review our first Tyler Perry movie!

Panda's might be one of the dumbest species on the earth.  What might the other be?  A woman lies about her husband beating her, when clearly it was a ghost.  We'll get Ghost Adventures on the case.

Learn how to get a nude spread of The Commish, and this episode isn't even ten minutes deep yet.  Find out more than you need to know about our individual semen.  We discuss a revolutionary sex toy.  Thailand is almost as bad as Africa because a man is marrying his decomposing girlfriend.  We answer the burning question on everyone's mind.  How long would each of us wait after a woman dies to stop having sex with her?  Are cat's known for flight?  Oh, no, okay then.  Would a cat de-rail a train if you put it on the track?  We answer this question as well.  The Commish helps a family through a gambling addiction.  We help another family decide whether to buy a bike for their teenage daughter.  And we also help a moron pick a name for their science fair project.  And then we review another blaxploitation film, Petey Wheatstraw: The Devil's Step-Son.

Due to some technical difficulties, Dusty will be much louder than everyone else for the next couple of weeks.  Revel in the fact that we have resolved our issues though, and all the sound problems will be cleared up in a couple of weeks!  We come up with our own God's and rename the ones that need it.  What color is Mr. Clean?  What are the real rules for being a Highlander?  We discuss some Walking Dead, and how people from Philly must be douchebags.  We also discuss issues of race to close out our Black History Month celebration!  What's the difference between ham and Canadian bacon?  We go in depth with this one.  The senior's menu at Denny's seems lacking.  And then we review Black Snake Moan to fill out an amazing Black History Month.

Only one more week of poor sound design.  The gang is back, and you can only really hear one of us good.  Judge Dredd, the Third Reich, and burning poles.  Within ten minutes, this train has jumped the tracks.  A naked man is welcomed to Wal-Mart.  Another naked man steals a fire truck, and an epic chase ensues!  We continue our discussion about a cat de-railing a train, and include answers from the wisdom that is Yahoo! Answers.  This leads into our discussion of displacer beasts, and News Jeff's thesis on said beasts.  We top it off with some Dear Commish and then we finally review Rise of the Planet of the Apes as a group.

We talk doomsday preparations since the discovery of an asteroid that will surely collide with earth.  Hulk Hogan sex tape talk!  We also talk the current financial status of other wrestlers.  Yeah, Brother.  And then we review TMNT II: Secret of the Ooze.

We didn't all see The Hunger Games, but we're going to talk about it anyway.  What is it that would stop hunger in a future as bleak as it's portrayed in the movie?  Dusty has some cake pans that the rest of the crew questions.  Jeff isn't here to do the news.  Last time that happened, everything fell apart.  How will it pan out this time?  Women are stealing sperm from men in Africa for Ju-Ju rituals.  Should men really be worried about such a thing?  What we should be more worried about is grown men biting genitals off of children.  We brainstorm our own ideas for spreading the word about different causes.  And oh what a discussion about the girl scouts.  Then we review, Wolf Town.

Jeff has a touch of thhe full blow AIDS.  Just a touch though.  Our introductions fly off without a single hitch.  Is that a black power symbol or are you just wanting to fist me?  Captain Bukkake is our new favorite super hero.  He has to be born every time he appears though.  We go over our Full Metal Jousting standings.  An unknown guy in a garage band has a bat pee in his eye.  A ouija board tells someone to kill his friend.  He listens.  Shadowrun 2D goodness is hopefully on its way to us!  How do you measure the severity of a scrotum tear?  Truck nuts!  And then a review of Million Dollar Hotel, written by Bono!

Children's Book spoilers.  A man takes his unwilling cat for a job, and hyjinks ensue!  Penises references abound!  Two Japanese teenagers make a breakthrough as they discover how to time travel!  Thoughts on Ninja Turtles.  Dear Commish is very special with a lightning round of questions.  We review Blazing Saddles and then tell you which order in which to view Mel Brooks movies.

Wow, we really discuss then in depth.  What's the difference between Rihanna and cats?  I think we determine, no one cares.  Oh, those crazy black people and movies.  Dusty tries to explain card tricks, it's hard to do.  Listen to us review a movie on the fly, after Commish didn't watch his assigned movie.
