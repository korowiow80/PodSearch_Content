            <description>Join us as we have the Patriot Pastor, Garret Lear, (back for another interview, this time on The Great Awakening, which started around 1730 and was one of the precipitating factors of The American Revolution. Pastors like Jonathan Edwards (Sinners In The Hands of an Angry God) and George Whitfield (supported by Benjamin Franklin) traveled around the colonies, bringing the people closer to God, and the colonies closer to each other, giving them a feeling of union for the very first time. </description>

            <description>Join Tom, Scott, James, and his charming friend, Cinderella, as we journey to historic Gettysburg to discuss the bloodiest battle on American soil. AfterÂ joking aboutÂ the statue ofÂ  General Buford being waxed and blow-torched,Â  we visit the newly restored Gettysburg Train station, talkng to locals aboutÂ the Ground Hog Day type time warp of theÂ town they live in: in Gettysburg it's always early July of 1863!Â  ThenÂ we talk about theÂ spooky Lincoln ghost train, andÂ Robert E. Lee's worst mistake of the war. Finally,Â we fast-forward to General Dwight D. Eisenhower who retired to Gettysburg as we chat with one of his neighbors, comparingÂ Pickett's Charge up Cemetary Ridge to the D-Day invasion.</description>

            <description>Join Tom and James as they journey back in timeto Old Sturbridge Village (http://www.osv.org/) a historical theme park set inÂ 1830s Jacksonian America, when most government was handled  at the town meeting level. It was aÂ very self-sufficient time  when most everything was grown or made close to home. Menlived theirÂ entire lives within twenty miles of theirÂ birthplace, the farmer down the road might also be a cooper on his day off, andand owning a horse was theÂ equivalent ofÂ a Porsche 930 SE.Â As James and Tom wander theÂ town, they find out what it meant toÂ be a blacksmith, a cooper, what did kidsÂ do for fun back then,  what sheep are like, and what types ofÂ punishment wereinflictedÂ whenÂ Â they disobeyed theÂ young school MistressÂ at the one-room schoolhouse?</description>

            <title>Pilgrims & Puritans: Religious Roots of America</title>
            <link>http://www.themidnightridecast.com/podcast/41</link>
            <guid>http://www.themidnightridecast.com/sites/default/files/podcast/TMR The Patriot Pastor 1.mp3</guid>
            <description>Join us as we interview The PatriotÂ Pastor, Garret Lear:  http://www.thewelloflivingwater.com andÂ discuss the various separatists thatÂ settledÂ Seventeenth-Century New England. Every kid in America knows thatÂ in 1620 theÂ Pilgrims stepped off The Mayflower atÂ Plymouth Rock. Then men in black like Captain Miles Standish and William Bradford, clad inÂ buckled hats and shoes sat down with the rest of the Pilgrims to aÂ tastyÂ First Thanksgiving with Squanto and friendly Indians (and not-so-friendlyÂ Chief Massasoit).But just who were these hardy soulsÂ whoÂ bravedÂ the tempestuous North Atlantic  only toÂ hack out a distant, unknownÂ wildnerness? Was their Mayflower Compact an early Declaration of Independence, placing a direct reliance on God and notÂ King James? Why didn't they stay in civilizedÂ Leiden, Holland, where they found tolerance, safety, andÂ modern prosperity? Why were they carrying The Geneva Bible of John Calvin? And who were the Puritans, who came ten years later on The Arabella, with John Winthrop proclaiming, "A City on A Hill"?Listen now and sign up to also access our extra content, containing more conversing with Pastor Lear about the hsitory of the Pilgrims, and the brewing of a friendly "Holy War" between Scott and the Pastor.</description>
