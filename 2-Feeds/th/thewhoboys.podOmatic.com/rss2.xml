After a short hiatus due to Mr Shed having a nervous breakdown and needing a break during which he travelled to the amazonian jungles of South America in order to seek guidance and healing from the local shamen, he is BACK WITH BALLS TWICE AS BIG AS A SICK BABY'S SWOLLEN HEAD AND HE IS READY TO ROCK!
 
Yes, it's John Shed's Saturday Shake Up show 4, featuring a story about a jacket and a tribute to Brian 'WhoBoy' Coleman who has just been released from the fraggle wing of San Quentin Prison. Full of the latest, greatest, hippest and happeningest new beat music, it's time to put your polo neck on, don a beret and light a huge pipeful of SHAG.

Yes, this is it, listeners &#8211; the very final show, and it&#8217;s nearly 3 bloody hours long. In which we play every track from our final album of original tracks, &#8216;Party songs for Outpatients&#8217; &#8211; best album we&#8217;ve ever done - FACT. To download the album for free, just go www.whoboys.com!

Well, 40 shows, eh? A lot has happened since we started this podcast, and it&#8217;s been one hell of a journey. We&#8217;ve loved it, even though it nearly killed us. And we love you for listening to it &#8211; thank you. May you all live happy and joyous lives, and that&#8217;s from our hearts. Apart from that bastard Keith in Newcastle.

So as of now the Who Boys are giving up music to start painting and filmmaking &#8211; keep an eye out for us on t&#8217;internet. We&#8217;ll be back.  Enjoy the show. And remember &#8211; never forget yer Who Boys. Over and out.

On this show we play our only &#8216;concept&#8217; album, &#8216;The Life &amp; Disaster of Old Jack Mathers&#8217;, in its entirety. We feel this is arguably our best lyrical and musical achievement as a whole album. It&#8217;s dark &#8211; my God it&#8217;s dark &#8211; but it&#8217;s based on a character we used to see in our local pub when we lived around Holloway Road, London &#8211; a very sinister man. This is his life story, in the form of music.

It doesn&#8217;t really matter what we say in between the tracks on this show, as the show is really all about the album, so the programme just lists the tracks of the album in order.

Turn the lights off, pour yourself a glass of wine and enjoy.

1. Young Jack Mathers
2. Old Jack Mathers
3. &quot;He was one of these self-deluded tossers&quot;
4. Mathers in the betting shop
5. Place that Bet
6. &quot;He was somebody who looked like he wanted to kick yer head in&quot;
7. Mathers&#8217; Wife
8 .&quot;I&#8217;ll tell you about old Jack Mathers&quot;
9. He Went Down
10. &quot;This became my local when I got out of prison&quot;
11. Mathers&#8217; Memories
12. &quot;He was a malign influence on the pub&quot;
13. Inside the Mind of Mathers
14. &quot;There&#8217;s one in every pub&quot;
15. Lonely Hatred, Putrid, Wasted
16. &quot;Some say the guy had a criminal record&quot;
17. Mathers Waits
18. &quot;I remember the smell&quot;
19. &quot;I warned him&quot;
20. Mathers in the Hospital
21. &quot;So what happened to him then?&quot;
22. No one miss you when you die
