            <description><![CDATA[Dont miss this post 2008 election wrap-up with J. Scott and 
Chuck Browder with several special return guests.<br/><br/>Steve 
Young, a former stand-up comedian, whos social and political satire is 
recognized as some of the funniest, yet still poignant, observations with his 
stories regularly gracing the op-ed pages of major newspapers across the country 
and&nbsp;placing&nbsp;Steve in demand as&nbsp;a TV &quot;pundit&quot; on networks&nbsp;such as the <em>Fox 
News Channel </em>and <em>CNN, </em>as well as appearing on <em>The Today Show, 
Connie Chung </em>and <em>Good Morning America</em>.<p>As contributing editor at 
the Writer Guild Of America’s &quot;Written By&quot; magazine, Steve’s reputation has 
given him serious entrance to the best writers and producers in the industry 
while also allowing him one more outlet to lampoon the entertainment business he 
cares so much about. </p>

<p>No matter what the venue, Steve always seems to be creating something unique 
and important.&nbsp; In TV he has written for <em>Boy Meets World, Cybill, The Smart 
Guy </em>and (the new) <em>Family Affair, </em>as well as 
being&nbsp;acknowledged&nbsp;with the Prism Award and a Humanitas nomination.&nbsp; </p>

<p>As a film director/writer Steve turned the power brokers of Hollywood on 
their funny bones with his biting/satirical film, <em>My Dinner With Ovitz </em>
(<a href="http://www.mydinnerwithovitz.com/">www.mydinnerwithovitz.com</a>). </p>

<p>As an&nbsp;author of the inspiring &quot;<a href="http://www.greatfailure.com/content/blogsection/2/3/">Great 
Failures Of The Extremely Successful</a>&quot; (Tallfellow Press, Sept 2002)&nbsp;he was 
able to get the greats of many different fields to share their remarkable 
stories of adversity. Of &quot;Great Failures...&quot;, Jack Canfield, co-creator of 
&quot;Chicken Soup For The Soul,&quot; said, &quot;<em>When you finish reading this amazing 
book, you will never let failure or fear of failure stand in your way again</em>.&quot;
</p>

<p>Steve has more than shown his grasp of creating stories and characters that 
both entertain and enlighten (without it being <em>jammed</em> down our 
children’s throats). &nbsp;Executive editor, Rosemary Brosnan of his whacked-out 
novel, &quot;130 Tales of Winchell Mink&quot; (Harper Collins 2004), &quot;...it's one of the 
funniest and freshest manuscripts I've ever read.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;15 Minutes&quot; 
(Harper&nbsp;Collins, 2005),&nbsp;another fun adventure novel, will follow.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<b><span style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">John Odom 
Republican candidate for NC Insurance Commissioner,&nbsp;Richard Morgan 
Republican candidate for NC Superintendent of Public Instruction, Teresa Sue 
Bratton Democrat candidate for U.S. Congress NC-6, Mark McMains Libertarian 
candidate for NC Insurance Commissioner, Christopher Cole Libertarian candidate for U.S. Senate, Mike 
Munger Libertarian candidate for Governor of NC, and IWF's Senior Policy Analyst Amy Watson&nbsp; </span><br/><br/></b><p>Insurance Commissioner Jim Long is finally retiring, and <b>the 
Journal endorses Republican John Odom to replace him</b>. Odom is not an 
insurance expert, but he is an experienced political leader, a conservative 
Republican who was a tremendous asset to the Raleigh City Council for years. He 
promises to be a consumer advocate in the job. Long's hand-picked successor, 
Democrat Wayne Goodwin, has experience in the department, but Goodwin has always 
struck us as a too-eager politician.</p>







As your candidate for insurance commissioner, I want to thank 
you for visiting the JOHN ODOM for Insurance Commissioner website.<br/>
The Department of Insurance affects your pocketbook more than any other 
department in Raleigh.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the insurance commissioner should serve the people by helping to 
provide the best climate for insurers to operate, and should be the state's 
consumer advocate in insurance matters.<br/>
<br/>
Making sure insurance companies live up to their agreements to provide services 
to the insured and to the public is important to me. The insurance industry 
provides a vital service to the public, and I salute those in the industry who 
take on this burden with the priority of serving the people they insure. <br/>
I stand for serving the people of North Carolina with honesty and integrity.<br/>
We need to insist on good government. People have had enough of reading about 
scandals and corrupt politicians.<br/>
<br/>
I stand for a workers' compensation system that is affordable to employers yet 
fair to employees.<br/>
<br/>
I will make sure the Department of Insurance responds to consumer complaints 
quickly and efficiently. I will make sure the Department responds to AGENTS 
quickly and efficiently-- and with courtesy and respect.<br/>
<br/>
Having the best qualified employees, especially the Deputy Insurance 
Commissioners and Chief Deputy, must be a priority and will be a priority with 
the John Odom administration.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your support and your vote in November.<br/><br/>Richard Morgan has held almost every top leadership position in 
the North Carolina House of Representatives; however, it is most important to 
note his Education Committee assignments for multiple terms. They included the 
Education Budget Committees such as the Full Appropriations Committee; 
Appropriations Sub-Committee on Education and the Substantive Policy Committee 
on Education. <br/>
<br/>
Morgan was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1990 and 
was Speaker of the House 2003-2004. He served eight consecutive terms as a 
member. He served as Speaker ProTempore 2005-2006, House Minority Leader and 
Chairman of the House Financial Institutions Committee 1999-2000, House Rules 
Chairman 1995-1998 and Vice-Chairman of the House Finance Committee 1993-1994.
<br/>
<br/>
He was the recipient of The Governor&quot;s Award and recognized as Legislator of the 
year by the North Carolina Wildlife Federation in 1997. <br/>
<br/>
Morgan received the Legislator of the Year Award from the North Carolina 
Association of Home and Hospice Care in 2004 and the North Carolina Association 
of Manufacturers in 2003 as well as the Champion of Transportation Award from 
North Carolina GO in 2003. <br/>
<br/>
Richard Morgan was chairman of the very first Moore County Drug Task Force. He 
has also been active in the Southern Pines Jaycees and supports the Boy Scouts 
of America. He has served the administrations of two North Carolina governors 
and was appointed by them to the North Carolina Council on the Status of Women 
and the North Carolina Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. 
Morgan was special assistant to the Secretary of the North Carolina Department 
of Human Resources and also served on the staff of the Governor of North 
Carolina. He has been a Republican nominee for North Carolina Insurance 
Commissioner and for the North Carolina House of Representatives. <br/>
<br/>
Richard Morgan is noted for his leadership not only in business, but also in 
civic, government and political service. He has been active in the Kiwanis Club 
of the Sandhills, serving as a member of its board of directors and receiving 
the Legion of Honor award for 25 years of service. He was chosen to receive the 
1993 Distinguished Alumnus designation from Sandhills Community College and in 
1991 he was selected as one of the Five Outstanding North Carolinians. He served 
a three-year term as a member of the board of directors of the University of 
North Carolina at Chapel Hill General Alumni Association. <br/>
<br/>
He married the former Cindy Richardson, also a Moore County native and a nurse. 
She is an Associate Vice President with the Association for Home and Hospice 
Care of North Carolina. They make their home on a farm near Eagle Springs and 
his office is in Pinehurst. <br/>
<br/>
Following college graduation, Morgan served in North Carolina Government until 
1977, and by 1981 he had started his own insurance brokerage firm &quot;from 
scratch.” Through long hours and determination, he built it into a successful 
business serving insurance clients throughout Moore County and North Carolina. 
He is also a North Carolina Real Estate Broker, a cattle farmer and is involved 
with several other businesses.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after high school graduation, Morgan enrolled at Sandhills Community 
College where he obtained an Associate of Arts degree with honors and was a 
member of Phi Theta Kappa Honorary Society. He completed his formal education at 
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a Bachelor of Arts degree 
in political science. Throughout his education, Morgan worked to pay the costs.<br/>
<br/>
Richard Timothy Morgan, 56, was born and grew up in the small town of Southern 
Pines, Moore County, North Carolina. His parents, also Moore County natives,

<p><b>
Insurance Goals
</b>
</p>






<ul><li>Decrease auto insurance for younger adults enrolled in school and 
	improve discounts for working families. </li><li>Lower home owners insurance for all the people and strengthen insurance 
	coverages for the people who live in the southeast of the state. Residents 
	should be able to have both their primary residence and vacation homes 
	covered under the same policy.</li><li>Lower insurance rates for anyone that takes a driver refresher or safety 
	class every four years and maintains a safe driving record.</li><li>Create more affordable business insurance for locally based and operated 
	companies. Repeal workmans comp premiums to help insure their affordability 
	factor, which will in turn promote commerce, and keep companies operating 
	and employing the citizens. The insurance industry needs to invest their 
	profits to improve the economy.</li><li>Lower insurance for the family farmer. Encourage agricultural 
	development to promote more jobs for rural areas.</li><li>We need to lower the cost of insurance for all teachers in the state. It 
	will include home, auto, family health care, and life insurance. They are 
	responsible for our children and we need to repay them for insuring our 
	children's future.</li></ul>







<b>
<p>Health Care choices in North Carolina</p>





</b>
<ul><li>Insurance companies must encourage all doctors to accept insurance by 
	paying them a customary and usual fee for their services.</li><li>Insurance companies need to stop promoting participation in their 
	companies based on below standard fees. This will only result in lowering 
	quality of health care in this state. People should be able to choose a 
	physician and be properly compensated without increased costs.</li><li>Health insurance companies need to allow college students to be covered 
	under their parents policy for up to 24 months after graduation or until 
	they obtain a full time job. Well being promotes good health, thus lowering 
	health costs. These students are our future and they are in our hands now, 
	we will be in their hands later.</li><li>Free drug care for the elderly of North Carolina is ideal. These people 
	should not have to live their golden years worried about paying for the 
	medications they need to survive. Drug and insurance companies should work 
	together to absorb the cost.</li></ul>







<b>
<p>For State Employees</p>





</b>
<ul><li>My goal is to decrease auto and home insurance by 40%. </li><li>For current and retired state employees I plan for free family health 
	care premiums. </li></ul>







<p>&nbsp;At the age of 46, I have accomplished many of my long-term 
goals. My family is most important to me and extremely supportive. I am happily 
married to my wife, Denise and we share 3 wonderful children. Our oldest 
daughter, Elizabeth, is a Senior at N.C. State University where is she is 
finishing her undergraduate degree in Economics. Steven is an 8th grader at 
Centennial Campus Middle and Brian is a fifth grader at Fuquay-Varina 
Elementary.<br/>
<br/>
I have been a resident of North Carolina for more than 31 years and am proud to 
call this great state my home. My family lives in Fuquay-Varina, a growing town 
in southern Wake County. I served on the Board of Directors for the 
Fuquay-Varina Fire Department for 2 years and worked hard to make sure that 
firefighters were well equipped.<br/>
<br/>
Currently, I am the owner of Cary Towing and Carolina Towing and with my wife in 
1998 started Cary Auto Body Specialists. Our business has prospered in the past 
few years and daily we deal with auto insurance companies, which is why I am 
well aware of the high insurance premiums and determined to help customers.<br/>

			<title>Martine Ehrenclou author of Critical Conditions &amp; John Villarreal of Villarreal Media </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/martine-ehrenclou-author-of-critical-conditions-john-villarreal-of-villarreal-media-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p align="justify">Author Martine Ehrenclou, MA, received a thorough education 
in hospitals with the extended hospitalizations of both her mother and 
godmother. Having spent the equivalent of a full year in three separate 
hospitals in different states, Martine was determined to find out if her family 
members' hospitalizations were the norm.</p>

<p align="justify">After interviewing fifty families, she found out that in fact 
they were the norm. Family members all reported feeling completely lost, 
overwhelmed and stymied by the hospital system. They couldn’t reach doctors when 
they needed them, nurses didn't respond to the call button, medication mistakes 
put their loved ones in peril, and infectious diseases delayed patients' 
recoveries, if in fact the patients made it out alive. Many were convinced that 
medical errors had killed their family members.</p>

<p align="justify">Alarmed by what she heard, Martine became extremely motivated 
to undertake further investigation of hospital patient care. She interviewed 
over eighty-five registered nurses who worked in hospitals, dozens of 
physicians, physician assistants, hospital social workers, psychologists, and 
other medical staff to find out what was going on in hospitals and why so many 
family members were distraught over their loved ones’ hospitalizations.</p>

<p align="justify">From all of the interviews and hundreds of hours of research, 
Martine realized that hospital care was in crisis. She set out to do something 
about it. She understood there was no way for her to fix hospital care, but knew 
that if she could educate family members and get them involved, patients would 
have safer hospital stays. Hence, the writing of her book, <em>Critical 
Conditions: The Essential Hospital Guide To Get Your Loved One Out Alive.</em></p>

<p align="justify">Martine is a writer and public relations and marketing 
executive, with clients that include authors, psychologists, and entrepreneurs. 
As past owner of Love Letters Ink, she was interviewed as the &quot;Contemporary 
Cyrano&quot; by national TV talk and news shows (Phil Donahue, Jenny Jones, ABC World 
News Tonight, CNN, etc.), national magazines (Time Magazine, Inc, The Economist, 
Glamour, and others) and newspapers (The Los Angeles Times, Washington Post and 
others). She has had several of her stories published in bestselling books and 
has written for newspapers and magazines.</p>

<p align="justify">She received her masters degree with honors in psychology 
from Pepperdine University, Los Angeles, CA. She conducted research for the UCLA 
Neuropsychiatric Hospital and research for a forensic psychologist. Martine has 
had a psychiatric article published in <em>The Journal of Forensic Sciences</em> 
and presented her own research paper at a national AAFS conference. She also 
worked as a counselor at Southern California Counseling Center.</p>

<p align="justify">She currently runs writing groups for at-risk teenagers and 
adults.</p>
Hospital care has become hazardous to the patient's 
health. It's a topic that hits news desks across the country every week. 
Recently Arizona State University released a shocking study. Their findings, 
with regards to the number of deaths caused by hospital errors is staggering. 
Just to get a perspective, the study uses a startling analogy...&quot;if if a jumbo 
airliner crashed every day, it wouldn't equal the number of deaths in today's 
hospitals as result of deadly medical errors, medication and surgical mistakes 
and hospital acquired infectious diseases!&quot; According to The Fifth Annual 
HealthGrades Patient Safety in American Hospitals Study, 2008, nearly a quarter 
of a million preventable deaths occur in hospitals nationwide.
<p align="left">These highly publicized and alarming statistics were the basis 
for Martine Ehrenclou's new book, Critical Condistions: The Essential Hospital 
Guide To Get Your Loved One Out Alive. Ehrenclou believes that hospital deaths 
could be prevented if patients had an advocate - a family member, close friend, 
or someone who can act as a sentinel to prevent medical errors. Patients who 
receive the wrong drug or the wrong dosage is the leading cause of hospital 
deaths, and these incidents touch everyone's life at one time or another. 
America finally faced this growing problem when actor Dennis Quaid brought media 
attention to the near death of his newborn twins, Thomas and Zoe, after they 
were given an overdose of the drug heparin.<br/>
<br/>
Critical Conditions is a step-by-step guide to traverse the unfamiliar hospital 
maize. Based on over 150 interviews with registered nurses, physicians and 
hospital staff, families, Martine's own experiences with hospitalized family 
members and hundreds of hours of research. It is a book for family members 
written by a family member who has been there.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has a parent, spouse, sibling or child in the hospital, they must get 
actively involved to monitor and oversee the medical care that is provided. 
Critical Conditions will arm you with helpful facts to:<br/>
<br/>
Prevent deadly medical errors, medication mistakes &amp; infectious diseases.<br/>
<br/>
Reach doctors when you really need them - every time<br/>
<br/>
Be proactive as you oversee your loved one's hospital care<br/>
<br/>
Navigate and manage the hospital system with confidence. <br/></p>

Jim Sciutto is ABC News’ Senior Foreign correspondent, based in 
London. Since moving overseas in 2002, he has reported from more than 40 
countries in Europe, Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, where 
he’s completed more than 100 assignments. His globe-trotting role for ABC News 
has put him on multiple trips to war-zones from Iraq to Afghanistan to 
Israel-Palestine, undercover in Zimbabwe and Myanmar, under fire in Beslan, 
Russia, and on frenetic cross-country tours of China and India for special, 
multi-part ABC series. When he was named senior foreign correspondent in 2006, 
he was the first person to carry the title since Peter Jennings and Pierre 
Salinger.<br/>
<br/>
Sciutto won the 2007 George Polk Award for television for his undercover 
reporting in Myanmar during the military regime’s brutal crackdown on peaceful 
demonstrations in October 2007. He won Emmy awards in 2004 and 2005 for best 
story in a regularly scheduled newscast, covering northern Iraq for “Iraq: Where 
Things Stand.” He was nominated for other Emmys in 2005 for outstanding coverage 
of a breaking news story for “Crisis in Beslan” and in 2007 for his contribution 
from Cambodia for Good Morning America’s “Around the World” series. <br/>
<br/>
Sciutto was the only western reporter to make his way inside Myanmar during the 
2007 crackdown, the first television reporter to interview Saudi Arabia’s King 
Abdullah and one of a handful of journalists allowed inside an Iranian nuclear 
plant in 2005. During the Iraq war, Sciutto was the only reporter embedded with 
the U.S. Special Forces. <br/>
<br/>
Prior to joining ABC News in 1998, Sciutto was Hong Kong correspondent for Asia 
Business News, an Asia-wide TV network owned by Dow Jones. For ABN, he covered 
Hong Kong’s return to China in 1997, and reported on every country in the 
region, including assignments to China, Mongolia, Laos, Vietnam, Singapore and 
South Korea. <br/>
<br/>
Sciutto’s first job in television was as moderator and producer of “The Student 
Press,” a weekly public affairs talk show for U.S. and Canadian college students 
broadcast on PBS. <br/>
<br/>
Sciutto earned a degree in history from Yale University in 1992. He was a 
Fulbright Fellow in Hong Kong from 1993 to 1994. In 2008, he was selected as a 
lifetime member of the Council of Foreign Relations. In 2002, he was appointed 
Associate Fellow of Pierson College at Yale. <br/>
<br/>
He lives in London with his wife, Gloria Riviera, also a London-based 
correspondent for ABC News.<br/><br/>A foreign correspondent for ABC News, Sciutto examines and 
explains the increasingly negative attitudes toward the United States among 
citizens of Muslim and Arab countries in this deeply insightful book. Structured 
around interviews conducted in the Middle East and the U.K., the book offers 
ample anecdotal evidence to suggest that anti-American sentiment—once the 
province of fringe groups—has gone mainstream, becoming in effect, a form of 
Middle Eastern nationalism, uniting moderates and radicals, Muslims and 
Christians for whom freedom implies the freedom from American interference. 
Sciutto weaves together interviews with historical background, poll data and 
personal experience in this consistently informative and captivating account. In 
the strongest interviews, including one with a young, reform-minded Iranian 
activist and another with an Iraqi doctor, the book sets intense, sometimes 
horrifying experiences against a complicated and changing political backdrop. 
The author makes a few amorphous foreign policy recommendations on the basis of 
his research, but the book is less interesting for what it reveals about 
American policy than for its empathetic and candid depiction of its subjects and 
their lives.<br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

			<title>Chaplain Todd DuBord, researcher for Chuck Norris's Black Belt Patriotism &amp; Republican U.S. House candidate Hugh Webster</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/chaplain-todd-du-bord-researcher-for-chuck-norris-s-black-belt-patriotism-republican-u-s-house-candidate-hugh-webster]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Todd A. DuBord was raised in the Bay Area of Northern 
California, in an atheist and agnostic background. As a young adult, he sensed 
that there was much more to life than he had been led to believe. Initially 
incorporating a wider pursuit of the world religions, Todd prayed to God, “If 
you show me the truths and purpose of this life, I will spend the rest of my 
life helping people to understand them.”<br/>
<br/>
In his years of research, both informal and formal (B.A. From Bethany 
University; M.Div. from Fuller Theological Seminary), Todd accepted that the 
claims of Christianity were true. Todd’s areas of expertise are in apologetics, 
biblical languages and studies, American religious history, historical and 
ecclesiastical theology, leadership equipping, and pastoral care and counseling. 
While going through his seven years of undergraduate and graduate studies, Todd 
also worked in business for a copier corporation, at which he served as 
Operations Manager for the entire region of Southern California.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout his initial years as a Christian in the Bay Area and Southern 
California, Todd also served in areas of prison ministry, homeless ministries, 
drug and alcohol rehabilitation, various discipleship programs, and in various 
Church leadership roles. Through seminary Todd also served as overseer of a 
thirteen-facility retirement home and convalescent hospital ministry, as well as 
a chaplain intern at U.C. Medical Center in Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
Chaplain Todd served as a youth pastor (in a Foursquare Church) in the 1980’s, 
an Associate Pastor (of a Presbyterian Church) in the 1990’s, and the past 
twelve years served as Senior Pastor of Lake Almanor Community Church, located 
near Lake Almanor on the edge of the Lassen National Forest in Northern 
California. In April 2008, he accepted the invitation of Chuck and Gena Norris 
to join them full time in serving the diversity of their humanitarian efforts 
and ministries as the Chaplain of Topkick Productions (and other Chuck Norris 
enterprises). Todd also accompanied Chuck Norris to Iraq in September of 2007, 
where they visited 15 military bases and over 18,000 troops. Todd’s revisionist 
ministry and research, as well as his story of their trip to Iraq, can be 
located, read, and downloaded at this website.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past two years, Chaplain Todd has gained national recognition in his 
work to restore Christian revisionism and reductionism from American historic 
sites and landmarks. He has successfully led restorations of our Christian 
heritage to the Jamestown Settlement (first English colony in America) and the 
Washington Monument (advances that were broadcasted on Fox News and other news 
agencies across the country). He continues to march against revisions at 
Monticello (Thomas Jefferson’s estate), the U.S. Supreme Court, and other 
historic landmarks that are revising America’s religious history.<br/><br/>Todd is known as a passionate, caring chaplain, who respects all people and 
inspires others to genuinely live and grow spiritually. He is a leader of 
leaders, and loves to simply serve God and encourage others wherever he’s 
called. As a speaker, Todd is an inspiring educator and motivator, using a blend 
of information, historical quotes, visuals, and contagious humor. His past 
messages, given as a Senior Pastor of Lake Almanor Community Church, are heard 
by people all over the world from his website and can be downloaded for free at 
www.iTunes.com (at the latter by typing in “almanor” or “dubord” to find link 
for “Lake Almanor Community Church). <br/><br/><p align="left"><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Born and 
raised on his family's farm in rural Caswell County, Hugh Webster is not what 
you would call a &quot;polished politician.&quot; He is blunt, brash, and firm in his 
straightforward, common sense convictions.&nbsp; Hugh Webster has never been accused 
of pandering to political correctness, but has earned the reputation of one 
unafraid to tell the truth and stand by his convictions.</span></font></p>

<font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;">That 
straightforward, common sense manner served the taxpayers of North Carolina well 
while Webster served in the State's General Assembly from 1995 through 2006.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">During those 12 years, Webster never once 
voted in favor of a state budget that included a tax increase and he never voted 
in favor of legislation that went against the provisions set out by the North 
Carolina Constitution. Webster led the fight to stop illegal aliens from getting 
NC drivers' licenses and fought against liberal legislation to allow illegal 
aliens to get in-state tuition and register to vote. He sponsored legislation 
known as &quot;The Baby Greer Act&quot; that would allow those convicted of murdering a 
pregnant woman to be charged with double homicide instead of a single murder.<br/></span></font><font face="Arial"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In Raleigh, Hugh Webster stood firm in his 
defense of the State's Constitution and protected the wallets of North 
Carolina's taxpayers.</span><br/>
<br/>
<span style="font-family: Arial;">Webster has pledged that as your Congressman 
in Washington, he will continue to take a firm stance defending the US

			<title>Senior writer at the Culture and Media Institute Kristen Fyfe, Clintons4McCain co-founder Anne Franklin, &amp; Paul F. Villarreal  </title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/senior-writer-at-the-culture-and-media-institute-kristen-fyfe-clintons4mc-cain-co-founder-anne-franklin-paul-f-villarreal-]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Kristen Fyfe joined the staff of the Culture and Media Institute on November 
20, 2006. Fyfe will serve as a Senior Writer for CMI. Fyfe was recently employed 
by the Alexandria, VA office of the Parents Television Council as a Senior 
Writer and Editor. In the spring of 2006 she authored a study documenting the 
violent content of children’s television. That study received unparalleled press 
coverage for the organization. <br/>
<br/>
Fyfe is also an Emmy-nominated producer and writer having worked most recently 
for South Carolina Educational Television. There she hosted and produced two 
weekly public affairs programs and specials that aired on the statewide network. 
She graduated summa cum laude with a Master’s of Science in Journalism from 
Northwestern University.<br/><br/><p>The <b>Culture and Media Institute</b> is an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States" title="United States">
American</a> non-profit organization focusing on promoting what it believes to 
be traditional values in American culture and beliefs and fair treatment of 
conservatives in the news media. It was founded in October 2006 as a division of 
the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Research_Center" title="Media Research Center">
Media Research Center</a>, a group that monitors perceived liberal news media 
bias.</p>

<p>CMI promotes its mission through editorials and research reports. &quot;Eye on 
Culture&quot; is a regular feature in which CMI writers express their opinions on the 
state of American popular culture. Among its viewpoints include opposition to 
the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairness_Doctrine" title="Fairness Doctrine">
Fairness Doctrine</a> and opposition to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage" title="Same-sex marriage">
same-sex marriage</a>. In March 2007, the CMI published a &quot;National Cultural 
Values Survey&quot; and concluded from its results that most Americans perceived a 
decline in moral values. One study released by the organization in July 2007 
claimed that television viewing time correlated directly with one's liberal 
attitude, even possibly degrading to moral attitudes.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> crime 
drama <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_Case" title="Cold Case">Cold 
Case</a></i> has been twice criticized by the CMI for alleged
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Christian_prejudice" class="mw-redirect" title="Anti-Christian prejudice">
anti-Christian prejudice</a> in two episodes.&nbsp; In May 2008, CMI released 
another report, one that claimed a moral decline in &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dear_Abby" title="Dear Abby">Dear 
Abby</a>&quot; columns.</p>
<p>Clintons4mccain was started as a grass roots effort by Cristi Adkins, Anne 
Franklin, Peter Boykin and a team of Clinton Supporters who are adamantly 
opposed to the DNC, the media and Hollywood selecting their presidential 
nominee. “We’re mad as hell and not going to simply fall in line like Stepford 
Wives.” The Clintons4mccain group plans to join other organizations across the 
country for a large army of dedicated soldiers devoted to ONE unified mission…<br/>
<br/>
For Information on Operation NOBAMA, go to www.Justsaynodeal.com<br/>
<br/>
To Join the group, you can go to www.clintons4mccain.com as well as the myspace 
page, http://www.myspace.com/clintons4mccain and get the latest updates on the 
www.youtube.com/clintons4mccain channel. <br/>
<br/>
With the pressure building on Senator Obama and masses exodus, it’s only a 
matter of time before the DNC realizes it’s biggest failure in ‘Votergate 08’ 
was the smoke and mirrors game they played on the entire 2008 Primary 
‘Selectoral’ process.</p>
<p>Co-founder Anne Franklin is a retired executive with a 
background in sales, marketing, strategy, operations and human resources. Like 
Hillary, Anne graduated from an all-female college. The nun (now Saint) who 
founded the college said, &quot;If you educate a man you educate a person, if you 
educate a woman you educate a family.&quot; That phrase stuck with Anne and according 
to Anne, has proven to be true from what she has seen in life. &quot;Hillary has a 
similar philosophy of taking care of the educational and healthcare needs of 
women/mothers to enable them to raise children who are less likely to drop out, 
abuse drugs and alcohol, commit violent crimes and end up on welfare, which is 
one of the things about her that appeals to me.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Anne is an Independent and believes that Independent voters are the most 
well-informed since, &quot;we don't let Party leaders or others decide for us for 
whom we will vote. We have to do our own research on all of the candidates from 
both parties. This year, Hillary was my first choice, followed by a Republican, 
followed by McCain, followed by another Democrat. I am a moderate (as I believe 
are most Americans). Hillary and McCain are both moderates. They belong to 
different Parties, but I am not aligned with a Party. So, I research all 
candidates' policies, their character and what each done in the past (which is 
the best predictor of future behavior). I don’t agree with any of the candiates 
100% on their policies. So, I look at the ones that are most important to me, 
where they stand and whether or not they are likely to get things done.&quot;</p>
<p>Also, make sure to listen our lively segment with Paul F. Villarreal and his brother John.&nbsp; You may check out their work at <a href="http://">www.youtube.com/user/</a><wbr/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PaulFVillarreal">PaulFVillarreal</a> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.villarrealsports.com/">www.villarrealsports.<wbr/>com</a></span></p>

			<title>Veteran Public Relations expert Fraser Seitel, blogger and P.U.M.A. founder Will Bower, and author of The Big Sort Bill Bishop</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/veteran-public-relations-expert-fraser-seitel-blogger-and-p-u-m-a-founder-will-bower-and-author-of-the-big-sort-bill-bishop]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><b><i>Fraser P. Seitel</i></b> is a veteran of more than three decades in the 
practice of public relations. In 2000, <i>PR Week</i> magazine named Mr. Seitel 
one of the &quot;100 Most Distinguished Public Relations Professionals of the 20th 
Century.&quot; </p>

<p>In 1992, after serving for a decade as senior vice president and director of 
public affairs for Chase Manhattan Bank, Mr. Seitel formed Emerald Partners, a 
management and communications consultancy, and also became senior counselor at 
the world's largest public affairs firm, Burson-Marsteller. </p>

<p>Mr. Seitel is a frequent contributor to cable television. Among other 
programs, he has appeared on Fox News Channel's <i>The O'Reilly Factor, Fox and 
Friends, Rivera Live, Fox Weekend,</i> and <i>On the Record with Greta Van 
Susteren;</i> MSNBC's <i>The News with Brian Williams and Nachman;</i> CNBC's <i>
Wall Street Journal Report;</i> and CNN's <i>Connie Chung Tonight, Inside 
Politics,</i> and <i>Larry King Live.</i> </p>

<p>Mr. Seitel has counseled hundreds of corporations, nonprofits, associations, 
and individuals in the area for which he had responsibility at Chase–media 
relations, speech writing, consumer relations, employee communications, 
financial communications, philanthropic activities, and strategic management 
consulting. </p>

<p style="margin: 0px;">Mr. Seitel is an Internet columnist at odwyerpr.com and 
a frequent lecturer and seminar leader on communications topics. Over the course 
of his career, Mr. Seitel has taught thousands of public relations professionals 
and students. <br/></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><br type="_moz"/></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">After studying and examining many texts in public relations, he concluded 
that none of them &quot;was exactly right:&quot; Therefore, in 1980, he wrote the first 
edition of <i>The Practice of Public Relations</i> &quot;to give students a feel for 
how exciting this field really is:&quot; In more than two decades of use at hundreds 
of colleges and universities, Mr. Seitel's book has introduced generations of 
students to the excitement, challenge, and uniqueness of the practice of public 
relations.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><br type="_moz"/></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><a href="http://willbower.blogspot.com/">Will Bower</a> was 
bred, raised, and educated in the epicenter of the Electoral Universe: Ohio. He 
began his political life in 1987 (at the age of 14) as a Youth Ambassador to the 
Soviet Union. The following year, he became a Youth Campaigner for Michael 
Dukakis. He went on to be chosen as a member of Boys' State Ohio (1989) and 
ended up winning the prestigious Delaware County Democratic Scholarship in 1990 
-- which he applied to his studies as a playwright at Kenyon College, Class of 
'94. Will spent most of the late 1990s traveling the world, living mostly in 
Paris, Sydney, and Los Angeles. However, the events of 2000 and 2001 inspired 
him to move to Washington DC, where he intended to work for the DNC. After a 
series of stellar interviews there, he realized to his disillusionment that the 
parties are mostly about fund-raising, for which he had little interest. 
However, he has remained in Washington DC, where he has been learning the 
politico-way from such Huffingtonian friends as Steve Clemons and Scott Shrake. 
He is currently a chief contributor for
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/will-bower/reforming-the-primary-cal_b_90903.html">
The Huffington Post</a> and for Florida-Delegates.com and is a researcher for 
Thomson CompuMark.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><br type="_moz"/></p>
<p style="margin: 0px;">Bill Bishop lives in Austin, Texas. He wrote <i>The Big Sort</i> 
with retired University of Texas sociologist Robert G. Cushing. Bishop has 
worked as a reporter at <i>The Mountain Eagle</i>, in Whitesburg (Ky.); a 
columnist at the Lexington (Ky.) <i>Herald-Leader</i> and on the special 
projects staff of the Austin (Tx.) <i>American-Statesman</i>. Bishop and his 
wife, Julie Ardery, owned and operated <i>The Bastrop County Times</i>, a weekly 
newspaper in Smithville, Texas. They now co-edit <i>The Daily Yonder</i>, a 
web-based publication (<a href="http://www.dailyyonder.com/">dailyyonder.com</a>) 
covering rural America.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px;"><br type="_moz"/></p>
<p align="left">Pulitzer Prize–finalist Bishop offers a one-idea grab bag with a 
thesis more provocative than its elaboration. Bishop contends that as Americans 
have moved over the past three decades, they have clustered in communities of 
sameness, among people with similar ways of life, beliefs, and in the end, 
politics. There are endless variations of this clustering—what Bishop dubs the 
Big Sort—as like-minded Americans self-segregate in states, cities—even 
neighborhoods. Consequences of the Big Sort are dire: balkanized communities 
whose inhabitants find other Americans to be culturally incomprehensible; a 
growing intolerance for political differences that has made national consensus 
impossible; and politics so polarized that Congress is stymied and elections are 
no longer just contests over policies, but bitter choices between ways of life. 
Bishop's argument is meticulously researched—surveys and polls proliferate—and 
his reach is broad. He splices statistics with snippets of sociological theory 
and case studies of specific towns to illustrate that while the Big Sort 
enervates government, it has been a boon to advertisers and churches, to anyone 
catering to and targeting taste. Bishop's portrait of our post materialistic 
society will probably generate chatter; the idea is catchy, but demonstrating 
that like does attract like becomes an exercise in redundancy.</p>

			<title>Columnist for Rolling Stone &amp; Spin magazines Carrie Borzillo-Vrenna, and from VH1's I Love Money, Mr. Boston</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/columnist-for-rolling-stone-spin-magazines-carrie-borzillo-vrenna-and-from-vh1-s-i-love-money-mr-boston]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Carrie Borzillo-Vrenna has written about music for such music 
magazines as Billboard, Spin, RollingStone.com and Alternative Press. She has 
covered the celebrity world, most recently for People, where she served as a 
staff correspondent before resigning to work on her next book, as well as Us 
Weekly and Teen People. The writer also penned the sex and relationship advice 
column “Dr. Love” for Gene Simmons defunct Gene Simmons Tongue magazine and the 
“Miss Truth” gossip column for the also-defunct award-winning allstarnews.com. 
She has appeared as a music and/or relationship expert on MTV, VH1, Fuse, E!, 
CNN, and MSNBC among others.<br/><br/>Borzillo-Vrenna’s first book, Eyewitness Nirvana: The Day 
by Day Chronicle, was released in 2000 and the expanded Nirvana: The Day to Day 
Illustrated Journals was released in 2003, both via Carlton Books.<br/><br/>The Wallingford, Connecticut native’s new book, “Cherry Bomb: 
The Ultimate Guide to Becoming a Better Flirt, a Tougher Chick, and a Hotter 
Girlfriend, and to Living Life Like a Rock Star” is due on Aug. 5, 2008 via 
Simon &amp; Schuster’s Simon Spotlight Entertainment. The non-fiction book is an 
A-to-Z reference for everything an edgy girl needs to know, including the 
obvious (style, beauty, dating, and sex tips) and the not-so-obvious (how to 
prepare Absinthe, how to hit on a celebrity, how to sneak backstage at a 
concert). It’s a girl’s guide with a difference; one that shows readers how to 
identify, go after, and get whatever they want in life, be it a hot guy, a great 
job, multiple orgasms, or a sexy new look—all while marching to her own (rock) 
beat.<br/>
<br/>
She lives in the Eagle Rock area of Los Angeles with her Grammy® Award-winning 
husband Chris Vrenna, who plays keyboards with Marilyn Manson.<br/><br/><p align="left"><span class="text">Lee Marks grew up outside Boston, MA and has 
always been a natural born comedian. Ever since he was young, he realized the 
best way to make friends is to make people laugh. When the reality television 
craze began several years ago, friends encouraged Lee to follow his dream and 
take his comedic act to a worldwide audience. All it took was one tryout for one 
show before Lee got his big break and was cast on the 2007 VH1 hit show &quot;I Love 
New York.&quot; The trashy nature of the show appealed to Lee, because it allowed him 
to be himself and express his sometimes raunchy yet hillarious style of humor 
without holding back. Now, millions of fans and hundreds of lays later, Mr. 
Boston is still on the top of his game, getting recognized virtually everywhere 
he goes. He has done numerous club appearances in Dallas, Phoenix, Miami, 
Charlotte, Buffalo, Minneapolis, and many other cities, all of which bring in a 
packed audience. Being asked by the producers to make an appearance on the 
second season of &quot;I Love New York,&quot; Mr. Boston is clearly one of the breakout 
stars of the show, and it remains a distinct possibility that he could 
eventually get his own show. With this rising star, sky is the limit!</span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="text">Some loyal Mr. Boston fans have decided to 
start a petition for him to get his own show.&nbsp; Check it out at

A DATE WITH ME, AND YOU STUMBLE UPON THIS PAGE TO &quot;RESEARCH ME&quot; BECAUSE YOU'VE

SAY SERIOUSLY!!!! I'VE HAD MULTIPLE GIRLS CANCEL DATES WITH ME BECAUSE THEY 
REALLY THINK I'M HAVING SEX WITH A DIFFERENT GIRL EVERY NIGHT. NOT TRUE! I'M

            <description><![CDATA[<p><b>Dr. Kathleen M. Puckett</b> spent 23 years as an FBI Special Agent, where 
she was primarily involved in the investigation and analysis of cases involving 
foreign counterintelligence and domestic and international terrorism.</p>

<p>In the mid 1970s, Kathleen was an officer in the Office of Special 
Investigations in the U.S. Air Force, where she acquired an early knack for 
investigations of Soviet and East Bloc espionage. When she left the Air Force, 
she was heavily recruited by both the FBI and the CIA.</p>

<p>By the mid 1980s she had learned Russian and was working against Soviet 
Intelligence in the San Francisco Division of the FBI.</p>

<p>Between 1988 and 1994 she was a principal in “Project Slammer,” an 
interagency espionage study that involved extensive interviews of individuals 
convicted of espionage.</p>

<p>In 1993 she became a founding member of the FBI National Security Division’s 
Behavioral Analysis Program (BAP), and was an operational and behavioral 
consultant to numerous high profile counterintelligence and counterterrorism 
investigations throughout the United States.</p>

<p>Between 1994 and 1998 she was the primary behavioral expert during the <em>
UNABOM</em> investigation. She also assisted FBI Inspector Terry Turchie in the 
investigation of Eric Rudolph in North Carolina in 1998, and received the 
Attorney General’s Award for Distinguished Service the same year.</p>

<p>In 2000 she completed a research internship that led to the production of a 
dissertation concerning the prediction of violence and the conferring of a Ph.D. 
in Clinical Psychology.</p>

<p>In 2001 Dr. Puckett conducted a multi-jurisdictional risk assessment study 
concerning lone domestic terrorists including Theodore Kaczynski, Timothy 
McVeigh and Eric Rudolph for the Counterterrorism Division of the FBI.</p>

<p>Dr. Puckett provides behavioral threat assessment consultation to 
international corporations and governmental security agencies, and is a law 
enforcement consultant to the Program of Psychiatry and the Law at the 
University of California at San Francisco. She is a frequent presenter at law 
enforcement and mental health community forums on both the <em>UNABOM</em> case 
and the psychology of terrorism.</p>
<p>
Terry Turchie and Dr. Kathleen Puckett give the reader a first-hand look inside 
the workings of the FBI, its workings with other agencies, and how the political 
forces around them have compromised the integrity of the agencies, particularly 
that of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Citing instances of political 
interference for the sake of political advantage at the expense of national 
security, one is able to understand how such examples of ineptitiude attributed 
to the FBI could happen. Turchie, after an outstanding career with the FBI, is 
now retired from the Agency and is affiliated with the University of California 
at Livermore National Laboratory. Dr. Puckett, after 23 years with the FBI, is 
now retired as well. She is also affiliated with the University of California at 
San Francisco. <span class="hpc_title">Homeland Insecurity</span> will be in 
bookstores in September, 2008.</p>

On September 12, 2001, the day after the fall of the Twin Towers, WABC-AM in New 
York City recruited John Batchelor to go on the air until Osama bin Laden was 
either killed or captured. On March 12, 2003, one week before the attack on 
Iraq, ABC Radio Networks invited John to bring his experiences to syndication as 
America committed itself to what is known as the Long War.</p>

<p align="left">
The John Batchelor Show celebrates the pell-mell pace and you-can't make-this-up 
quality of the 21st Century. John explores the global contest not only in search 
of national security in the Middle East and here in the homeland, but also in 
the struggle for energy security and food security across borders. Along the 
way, John celebrates the classic set pieces of American politics such as 
grotesquely lavish national campaigns, stock market roller-coaster events like 
the credit crisis of ‘07-‘08, the cleverness of the Congress to take care of 
itself first, and also the true joy of planetary exploration.<br/>
<br/>
The John Batchelor Show has broadcast from many corners of this good, modest 
planet, including New York, Los Angeles, Washington, Boston, Des Moines, 
Manchester, Orlando, Jerusalem, Amman, Gaza, Kazakhstan and Taipei.<br/>
<br/>
John is a veteran novelist, author of seven political romances as well as a 
short history of the Republican Party. Born in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, in 1948, 
John attended Lower Merion High School, Princeton University and Union 
Theological Seminary in New York City.<br/>
<br/>
The John Batchelor show can be heard in New York on Sunday nights on WABC-AM 770 
from 7-10PM Eastern Time, in Washington D.C. on WMAL-AM from 7-9PM Eastern Time, 
in San Francisco on KSFO-AM from 7-10PM Pacific Time, and in Los Angeles on KFI-AM 
640 from 7-10PM Pacific Time.</p>

Lawson attended Lakeland Senior High School in Lakeland, Florida, where he was 
president of the student council.[2] He moved to North Carolina in 1992,[2] 
where he graduated from Duke University with a degree in biomedical and 
electrical engineering and from Duke Medical School as a neurosurgeon.<br/>
<br/>
A year into his medical residency at Duke in neurosurgery, Lawson left to start 
a software company, MercuryMD, which focused on providing easier ways for 
physicians to access patient records through PDAs. Lawson served as the chief 
software architect for MercuryMD, which grew to serve 200 hospitals and have 70 
employees. He later sold the company.</p>

<p align="left">
During the campaign for the GOP 4th District nomination, Lawson has spoken about 
the higher cost of food and the overspending of the federal government. However, 
Price has stated that it is &quot;premature&quot; to render final judgment on the 
suitability of the Butner site before the environmental impacts are assessed, 
and he inserted a provision in the Department of Homeland Security's Fiscal Year 
2009 budget requiring a risk analysis of studying foot and mouth disease on the 
U.S. mainland before work can be done on design or construction of the disease 
research lab.</p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/stephen-mansfield-author-of-the-faith-of-barack-obama-the-faith-of-george-w-bush]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<b>Stephen Mansfield</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> 
bestselling author of <i>The Faith of George W. Bush</i>, <i>The Faith of the 
American Soldier</i>, <i>Then Darkness Fled: The Liberating Wisdom of Booker T. 
Washington, </i>and<i> Never Give In: The Extraordinary Character of Winston 
Churchill</i>, among other works of history and biography. Founder of both The 
Mansfield Group, a research and communications firm, and Chartwell Literary 
Group, which creates and manages literary projects, Stephen is also in wide 
demand as a lecturer and inspirational speaker.&nbsp; <br/><p>
In THE FAITH OF BARACK OBAMA (Thomas Nelson, August 5, 2008), Stephen Mansfield 
provides us with the most thoroughgoing examination of the role of religion in 
the Democratic presidential candidate's life to date. Mansfield, a recognized 
voice on the political Christian right, presents a balanced and objective 
analysis of Obama that is sure to surprise people across the political 
divide—and provoke widespread discussion about an issue that continues to be 
front-and center in this year&quot;s election. <br/>
<br/>
While the Rev. Jeremiah Wright controversy and its electoral fallout has often 
dominated the headlines, THE FAITH OF BARACK OBAMA shows us how the most 
under-reported story in the 2008 campaign could be Obama’s ability to reclaim 
the religious voice of the American political left after years of Democratic 
Party indifference.<br/>
<br/>
Refuting claims that Obama’s faith is &quot;political garb that focus group told him 
he ought to try.” Mansfield shows how Obama’s religion is transforming, lifelong 
and real. He observes: “Obama is the product of a new, post-modern generation 
that picks and chooses its own truth from traditional faith, much as a man 
customizes his meal at a buffet”-- putting him in sync with a growing number of 
Americans who were cited in a recent Pew Research study about religious 
attitudes in the U.S (June 2008). </p>




<p>
<b>THE FAITH OF BARACK OBAMA</b> is essential 
reading for anyone who seeks to understand the Illinois senator’s spectacular 
leap into the national spotlight—and the role that will religion will pay in 
this year’s election and will continue to play in future politics and culture. 
As Mansfield writes “In short, he (Obama) is going to be a political and 
religious force to be reckoned with in American society, and both his supporters 
and his detractors are well served by understanding why.”&nbsp;</p>

			<title>Larry Winget author of You're Broke Because You Want To Be &amp; Eric Roston author of The Carbon Age</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/larry-winget-author-of-you-re-broke-because-you-want-to-be-eric-roston-author-of-the-carbon-age]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Larry Winget, the Pitbull of personal development is the best-selling author 
of <strong><em>Shut Up, Stop Whining &amp; Get A Life </em></strong>and New York 
Times Bestseller<em> <strong>It's Called Work for a Reason!</strong></em>. He 
teaches universal principles that will work for anyone, in any business, at any 
time, and does it by telling funny stories. </p>


<p>He believes that most of us have complicated life and business way too much, 
take them way too seriously, and need to lighten up, take responsibility, and 
keep it all in perspective.</p>

<p><i>I wrote this book for the average person who has a job, makes 
a living and still can’t seem to get ahead. I wrote it for the person who dreams 
of being rich but can’t quite seem to turn his dreams into reality. I wrote this 
book for the person who is ready to turn his life around and finally have 
financial freedom. I wrote this book for the person who is covered in debt and 
can’t seem to stop living paycheck to paycheck. I wrote this for the person who 
spends more than they make and can’t figure out how to stop doing it.</i><br/>
<b>--Larry Winget </b><br/>
<br/>
If this describes you, you are not alone. Over 40% of families are feeling the 
pressure, spending more than they earn, and risking retiring financially 
dependent on the government, family, or charity. Larry Winget knows—he’s been 
where you are now. He grew up poor, then made and lost a fortune when a business 
in which he’d invested went bankrupt. But he worked his way back from 
rock-bottom to become a multi- millionaire. <br/>
Now he gets paid to help people in financial crisis on A&amp;E’s reality series, <i>
Big Spender</i>. On the show, he coaches people who have jobs, maybe even 
high-paying jobs, but are nevertheless in debt or living hand-to-mouth. His 
blunt take on their situations? <i>They’re broke because they want to be</i>. 
They all say they want stability, savings, and financial freedom, but their 
actions too often contradict their words. Larry helps them to see the 
contradiction, get back on track, and out of debt, step-by-step. He can help 
you, too. <br/>
<br/>
Whether your aim is to get out of debt, save for a house, or simply stop kidding 
yourself when it comes to savings (for retirement, for your kids’ college, 
whatever your goal) this book encourages you, through easy-to-complete 
worksheets and Larry’s bullying yet wise counsel, to <i>make it happen</i>. 
Larry’s motivating message: <i>If you want to be rich, you can</i>. But first, 
you have to stop being broke, and start getting ahead. And he’ll walk you 
through not only the necessary attitude adjustment, but the practical choices 
and actions that will get you there.</p>

<p>Eric Roston is a science writer in Washington, DC, and author of the 
forthcoming book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Carbon-Age-Element-Civilizations-Greatest/dp/0802715575/ref=sr_1_1/105-7494984-9518034?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190394339&sr=1-1">
<i>THE CARBON AGE: How Life's Core Element Has Become Civilization's Greatest 
Threat.</i></a> The book, based on three years of research, traces the dynamic, 
fundamental science that unifies seemingly disparate parts of our experience: 
Climate, energy, health, industry--the fastest way to learn the most about the 
world is through the carbon atom. <a href="http://www.walkerbooks.com/">Walker &amp; 
Co.</a> will publish the book in July.
<a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2007/12/31/old_lions_overseas_talents_eye_bestseller_lists/?page=2">
The Boston Globe</a> included <i>The Carbon Age</i> in its list of the 
most-anticipated books of 2008. The book has received endorsements from several
<a href="http://www.ericroston.com/reviews.html">prominent thinkers.</a></p>


<p>Roston is Senior Associate in the Washington, DC, office of
<a href="http://www.nicholas.duke.edu/institute">The Nicholas Institute for 
Environmental Policy Solutions</a> at Duke University. He is also a 
non-compensated Advisory Board member of <a href="http://www.clearstandards.com/">
Clear Standards, Inc</a>. </p>


<p>Previously, Roston wrote for <a href="http://www.roston.us/">TIME</a>, in its 
Washington bureau, where he covered economics, politics and technology. Roston 
joined the magazine in 2000 as a business reporter in the New York bureau, 
covering stories such as the collapse of Enron, China's emergence as a force in 
global trade, and how advanced computing technologies are reshaping the economy. 
An eyewitness to the collapse of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, 
Roston was a part of the reporting team that won a National Magazine Award for 
best single-issue coverage.</p>


<p>In September 2002, Roston became a part of TIME's Washington bureau. He 
traveled extensively with President George W. Bush and Senators John Kerry and 
John Edwards during the 2004 election campaign, providing analysis and reporting 
to the magazine's seasoned political team. He was also a frequent contributor to 
the magazine's work on energy, environmental and health issues. He has penned a 
monthly column on technology and society for TIME Inside Business. In the spring 
of 2004, he became Time.com's first blogger, writing a daily commentary on &quot;the 
technology that will carry us through tomorrow -- and the stuff that keeps us 
stuck in yesterday.&quot;</p>


<p>Roston has been a guest on Comedy Central's The Colbert Report, CleanSkies.tv, 
CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBC, National Public Radio and various radio stations 
nationwide and abroad. Prior to TIME, he wrote for LIFE magazine and contributed 
to Slate.com, where he wrote the &quot;Today's Papers&quot; column. Roston, who is fluent 
in Russian, holds an M.A. in Russian history, and a B.A. in modern European 
history, both from Columbia University.</p>

<p align="left">The story of carbon—the building block of life that is, 
ironically, humanity’s great threat. It could be said that all of us are a 
little alien—our bodies’ carbon atoms first shot forth from supernovas billions 
of years ago and far, far away. Carbon has always been the ubiquitous architect 
and chemical scaffolding of life and civilization; indeed, all living things 
draw carbon from their environments to stay alive, and the great cycle by which 
carbon moves through organisms, ground, water, and atmosphere has long been a 
kind of global respiration system that helps keep Earth in balance. And yet, 
when we hear the word today, it is more often than not in a crisis context: 
carbon dioxide emissions have sped up the carbon cycle; chlorofluorocarbons are 
destroying the ozone layer and warming the planet; the volatile Middle East 
explodes atop its stores of volatile hydrocarbons; carbohydrates threaten 
obesity and diabetes.<br type="_moz"/>
</p>


<p align="left">In <i>The Carbon Age</i>, Eric Roston evokes this essential 
element, its journey illuminating history from the Big Bang to modern 
civilization. Charting the science of carbon—how it was formed, how it came to 
Earth and built up—he chronicles the often surprising ways mankind has used it 
over centuries, and the growing catastrophe of the industrial era, leading us to 
now attempt to wrestle the Earth’s geochemical cycle back from the brink.

The Daily Show</a>. He is editor of the blog of the Robert J. Dole Institute of 
Politics at the University of Kansas (<a href="http://www.doleinstituteblog.org/">http://www.doleinstituteblog.org/</a>) 
and his own blog about online politics,
<a href="http://policybyblog.squarespace.com/">
http://policybyblog.squarespace.com/</a>.<br/><br/>Political blogs have grown astronomically in the last 
half-decade. In just one month in 2005, for example, popular blog DailyKos 
received more unique visitors than the population of Iowa and New Hampshire 
combined. But how much political impact do bloggers really have?<br/>
In <span class="star-caretcode-i">Blogwars</span> , David D. Perlmutter examines 
this rapidly burgeoning phenomenon, exploring the degree to which blogs 
influence--or fail to influence--American political life. Challenging the hype, 
Perlmutter points out that blogs are not that powerful by traditional political 
measures: while bloggers can offer cogent and convincing arguments and bring 
before their readers information not readily available elsewhere, they have no 
financial, moral, social, or cultural leverage to compel readers to engage in 
any particular political behavior. Indeed, blogs have scored mixed results in 
their past political crusades. But in the end, Perlmutter argues that blogs, in 
their wide dissemination of information and opinions, actually serve to improve 
democracy and enrich political culture. He highlights a number of the 
particularly noteworthy blogs from the specialty to the superblog-including 
popular sites such as Daily Kos, The Huffington Post, Powerlineblog, Instapundit, 
and Talking Points Memo--and shows how blogs are becoming part of the tool kit 
of political professionals, from presidential candidates to advertising 
consultants. While the political future may be uncertain, it will not be 
unblogged.<br/>
For many Internet users, blogs are the news and editorial sites of record, 
replacing traditional newspapers, magazines, and television news programs.
<span class="star-caretcode-i">Blogwars</span> offers the first full examination 
of this new and controversial force on America's political landscape.<br type="_moz"/>]]></description>

			<title>Legendary stand-up comedian Robert Schimmel (Clean), Rick Shenkman author of Just How Stupid Are We?, &amp; Malakkar Vohryzek</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/legendary-stand-up-comedian-robert-schimmel-clean-rick-shenkman-author-of-just-how-stupid-are-we-malakkar-vohryzek]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p align="left">Robert Schimmel is an American
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_comedian" title="Stand-up comedian" class="mw-redirect">
stand-up comedian</a> whose material is often X-rated and controversial. He is 
perhaps best known for his comedy albums and his appearances on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HBO" title="HBO" class="mw-redirect">HBO</a> 
and <i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Howard_Stern_Show" title="The Howard Stern Show">
The Howard Stern Show</a></i>. Schimmel's material almost always pertains to 
sex, whether he is discussing computers, his daughter, or animals.</p>



<p align="left">In 1998, Schimmel suffered a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">
heart attack</a>, and in June 2000, was diagnosed with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Hodgkins_lymphoma" title="Non-Hodgkins lymphoma" class="mw-redirect">
Non-Hodgkins lymphoma</a>. His treatments included
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy" title="Chemotherapy">
chemotherapy</a> and required long stays in the hospital.</p>



<p>Schimmel's willingness to frankly and humorously discuss the tragic events of 
his life in his act has set him apart from other comics. Before his illness, his 
act included a bit about how strange it might be if a person wore a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wig_%28hair%2529" title="Wig (hair)" class="mw-redirect">
wig</a> on their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pubic_hair" title="Pubic hair">pubic area</a>. 
When he lost his body hair due to chemotherapy treatment, he discovered that 
there really is such a thing — these wigs, or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkin" title="Merkin">merkins</a>, have 
existed for hundreds of years. He updated the comedy bit accordingly.</p>



<p>Bob will incorporate any aspect of his personal life into his act, even the 
death of his son. In perhaps his most extreme bit, Bob joked about making 
obscene suggestions to a lady from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make-a-Wish_Foundation" title="Make-a-Wish Foundation">
Make-a-Wish Foundation</a>.</p>



<p>Bob cites
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Bruce" title="Lenny Bruce">Lenny 
Bruce</a> as his all-time comedy hero. Like Bruce, Bob's raunchy act has gotten 
him into trouble from time to time. Bob had not been asked to perform on <i>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Night_with_Conan_O%27Brien" title="Late Night with Conan O'Brien">
Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a></i> from 1999 until a 2008 appearance, and he 
believed this was because of a particularly dirty sex joke he told during his 
last appearance.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span style="white-space: nowrap;" title="This claim needs references to reliable sources since March 2008"> </span></sup>However, his edgy style has made him a hit on <i>
The Howard Stern Show</i>.</p>



<p>In his stand-up act and a radio interview with Paul Harris, Bob talked about 
his November 8, 1999 appearance on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Squares" title="The Hollywood Squares" class="mw-redirect">
The Hollywood Squares</a>. The taping was reportedly stopped at least once when 
Bob ad-libbed jokes about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louie_Anderson" title="Louie Anderson">
Louie Anderson</a>. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Feud" title="Family Feud">Family 
Feud</a>, which Anderson hosted at the time, was taped in the same studio.)</p>



<p>Bob has released several comedy albums, including <i>Robert Schimmel Comes 
Clean</i>; <i>If You Buy This CD, I Can Get This Car</i>; <i>Unprotected</i>; 
and <i>Reserection</i>.</p>



<p>Bob is number 76 on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedy_Central" title="Comedy Central">
Comedy Central</a>'s list of the 100
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=100_Greatest_Stand-ups_of_All_Time&action=edit&redlink=1" title="100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time (page does not exist)" class="new">
Greatest Standups</a> of All Time.</p>



<p>Bob also wrote a book entitled <i>Cancer on $5 a Day* *(chemo not included): 
How Humor Got Me Through the Toughest Journey of My Life</i>.</p>


<p><font face="helvetica,arial">Richard Shenkman is the editor and 
founder of George Mason University's <a href="http://www.historynewsnetwork.org/">
History News Network</a>, a website that features articles by historians on 
current events. An associate professor of history at George Mason University, he 
can regularly be seen on Fox News, CNN, and MSNBC. He is a New York Times 
best-selling author of five history books, including <em>Legends, Lies &amp; 
Cherished Myths of American History.</em> His most recent book is <em>
Presidential Ambition: How the Presidents Gained Power, Kept Power and Got 
Things Done</em>, which was published in 1999 by HarperCollins. He is writing a 
new book, to be published by Basic Books, about the myths we need to face in a 
post 9/11 world. Educated at Vassar and Harvard, Mr. Shenkman is an 
award-winning investigative reporter and the former managing editor of KIRO-TV, 
the CBS affiliate in Seattle. In 1997 he was the host, writer and producer of a 
prime time series for The Learning Channel inspired by his books on myths. He 
gives lectures at colleges around the country on several topics, including 
American myths and presidential politics.&nbsp;

<p>Malakkar Vohryzek is the office coordinator in New York. He is a former 
prisoner of the federal government, sentenced to a mandatory minimum of 10 years 
for conspiracy to distribute LSD. During his seven-year-and-six-month prison 
stay, he earned his four-year degree, assisted prisoners with legal work and 
even managed to become a licensed dairy pasteurizer in California.</p>



<p>Vohryzek remains ardently opposed to intrusive and coercive government 
policies. He views his work against drug prohibition as just one of many avenues 
towards achieving a just and free society. To that end, he maintains an active 
online presence, being published in the <em>Los Angeles Times’</em> Blowback 
section, on Alternet and on the Huffington Post. He also regularly contributes 
to the D’Alliance, the blog of the Drug Policy Alliance Network.</p>

10 years the associate editor of the journal <i>Foreign Policy</i>, published by 
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In that capacity, he covered 
firsthand the fall of the Berlin Wall, the “Velvet Revolution” in

PHILIP ZIMBARDO is internationally recognized as the “voice and 
face of contemporary American psychology” through his widely seen PBS-TV series, 
Discovering Psychology, his classic research, The Stanford Prison Experiment, 
authoring the oldest current textbook in psychology, Psychology and Life, in its 
18th Edition, and his popular trade books on Shyness in adults and in children; 
Shyness: What it is, what to do about it, and The Shy Child. Past president of 
the American Psychological Association, and the Western Psychological 
Association.<br/>
<br/>
Zimbardo has been a Stanford University professor since 1968 (now an Emeritus 
Professor), having taught previously at Yale, NYU, and Columbia University. He 
is currently on the faculty of the Pacific Graduate School of Psychology, and 
the Naval Postgraduate School at Monterey, CA. He has been given numerous awards 
and honors as an educator, researcher, writer, and service to the profession. 
Recently, he was awarded the Vaclav Havel Foundation Prize for his lifetime of 
research on the human condition. His more than 300 professional publications and 
50 books convey his research interests in the domain of social psychology, with 
a broad spread of interests from shyness to time perspective, madness, cults, 
political psychology, torture, terrorism, and evil.<br/>
<br/>
Zimbardo has served also as the Chair of the Council of Scientific Society 
Presidents (CSSP) representing 63 scientific, math and technical associations 
(with 1.5 million members), and now is Chair of the Western Psychological 
Foundation. He heads a philanthropic foundation in his name to promote student 
education in his ancestral Sicilian towns. Zimbardo adds further to his 
retirement list activities: serving as the new executive director of a Stanford 
center on terrorism -- the Center for Interdisciplinary Policy, Education, and 
Research on Terrorism (CIPERT). He was an expert witness for one of the soldiers 
in the Abu Ghraib Prison abuses, and has studied the interrogation procedures 
used by the military in that and other prisons as well as by Greek and Brazilian 
police torturers.<br/>
<br/>
Noted for his personal and professional efforts to actually 'give psychology 
away to the public', Zimbardo has also been a social-political activist, 
challenging the U.S. Government's wars in Vietnam and Iraq, as well as the 
American Correctional System.<br/>
<br/>
His new book has been a New York Times bestseller: THE LUCIFER EFFECT: 
UNDERSTANDING HOW GOOD PEOPLE TURN EVIL (Random House, 2007; see 
www.lucifereffect.org).]]></description>

<p align="left">Philip Shenon is an investigative reporter with <em>The New York 
Times</em>, where he has worked since 1981. He was the lead reporter on the 
investigation of the September 11 commission and has held several of the most 
important assignments of the Washington Bureau, including chief Defense 
Department correspondent, diplomatic correspondent, Congressional correspondent 
and Justice Department Correspondent. He has reported for The Times from scores 
of countries across six continents. This is his first book.</p>
<p>Prof. Fagan is an archaeological generalist, with expertise in the broad 
issues of human prehistory. He is the author or editor of 46 books, including 
seven widely used undergraduate college texts. Prof. Fagan has contributed over 
100 specialist papers to many national and international journals. He is a 
Contributing Editor to American Archaeology and Discover Archaeology magazines, 
and formerly wrote a regular column for Archaeology Magazine. He serves on the 
Editorial Boards of six academic and general periodicals and has many popular 
magazine credits, including Scientific American and Gentleman's Quarterly.</p>

<p>Prof. Fagan has been an archaeological consultant for many organizations, 
including
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Geographic_Society" title="National Geographic Society">
National Geographic Society</a>, Time/Life,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica" title="Encyclopædia Britannica">
Encyclopædia Britannica</a>, and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" title="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> 
Encarta. He has lectured extensively about archaeology and other subjects 
throughout the world at many venues, including the Cleveland Museum of Natural 
History, the National Geographic Society, the San Francisco City Lecture 
Program, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smithsonian_Institution" title="Smithsonian Institution">
Smithsonian Institution</a>, and the Getty Conservation Institute.</p>

<p>In addition to extensive experience with the development of Public Television 
programs, Prof. Fagan was the developer/writer of Patterns of the Past, an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPR" title="NPR" class="mw-redirect">NPR</a> 
series in 1984-86. He has worked as a consultant for the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RKO" title="RKO" class="mw-redirect">RKO</a>, 
and many Hollywood production companies on documentaries. In 1995 he was Senior 
Series Consultant for Time/Life Television's &quot;Lost Civilizations&quot; series.</p>

<p>Prof. Fagan was awarded the 1996 Society of Professional Archaeologists' 
Distinguished Service Award for his &quot;untiring efforts to bring archaeology in 
front of the public.&quot; He also received a Presidential Citation Award from the 
Society for American Archaeology in 1996 for his work in textbook, general 
writing and media activities. He received the Society's first Public Education 
Award in 1997.</p>

<p>Fagan is critical of non-traditional archaeology, and has written scathing 
reviews of rivals outside academia. His own stance, that archaeology should 
remain a compendium of material facts, is influential within the field. This 
view permits Fagan's well-known textbooks to skirt issues that are controversial 
or political, including issues regarding gender, migration, and pre-Columbian 
oceanic voyages. His expository style is a departure from the kind of serious 
theoretical questioning of an earlier generation of archaeologist, particularly 
the pre-World War II generation of archaeologists, whose work he encompasses, 
but whose theoretical leanings he ignores. Critics of Fagan, therefore, point to 
his similarity with later members of the Boasian school of anthropology, who 
were more interested in tracking objects on a grid than in explaining 
similarities among objects found in various places, or denoting how notions of 
similarity were to be constructed.</p>

<p>Fagan appeared on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show" title="The Daily Show">The 
Daily Show</a> on March 17th, 2008 to discuss 'climate change and its impact on

			<title>New York Times best selling author of The Terrorist Watch Ronald Kessler</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/new-york-times-best-selling-author-of-the-terrorist-watch-ronald-kessler]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Ronald Kessler is the New York Times bestselling 
author of seventeen non-fiction books. Kessler began his career as a journalist 
in 1964 on the Worcester Telegram, followed by three years as an investigative 
reporter and editorial writer with the Boston Herald. In 1968, he joined the 
Wall Street Journal as a reporter in the New York bureau. He became an 
investigative reporter with the Washington Post in 1970 and continued as a staff 
writer until 1985. 
<p>Kessler's first book was THE LIFE INSURANCE GAME, 
an exposé of the life insurance industry published in 1985. His second book, THE 
RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD: The Story of Adnan Khashoggi, is the inside story of 
the world&quot;s preeminent arms dealer. Kessler’s next book, SPY vs. SPY: Stalking 
Soviet Spies in America, is the only book on the FBI’s secret 
counterintelligence program and contains the first interview with Karl Koecher, 
a Soviet bloc spy who became a mole in the CIA.</p>



<p>Kessler’s fourth book, MOSCOW STATION, is about 
the security breaches at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, the involvement of U.S. 
Marines, and the resulting investigations. Kessler’s THE SPY IN THE RUSSIAN 
CLUB: How Glenn Souther Stole America’s Nuclear War Plans and Escaped to Moscow 
is the bizarre tale of one of America’s most damaging spies who defected to the 
Soviet Union and committed suicide there.</p>



<p>Kessler’s sixth book, ESCAPE FROM THE CIA: How 
the CIA Won and Lost the Most Important KGB Spy Ever to Defect to the U.S., is 
about the defection and redefection of KGB officer Vitaly Yurchenko from a 
restaurant in Washington’s Georgetown section. It contains the only interview 
with Yurchenko by a western journalist and portrays the CIA’s disastrous 
mishandling of the case. Kessler’s INSIDE THE CIA: Revealing the Secrets of the 
World’s Most Powerful Spy Agency depicts what the CIA really does and was the 
only book about the agency written with the CIA’s limited cooperation.</p>



<p>For Kessler’s eighth book, THE FBI: Inside the 
World’s Most Powerful Law Enforcement Agency, the FBI gave Kessler unprecedented 
access to the bureau. The book revealed for the first time the defection of 
Vasili Mitrokhin, whose notes from the KGB’s archives disclosed the existence 
over the years of hundreds of spies in the U.S. The book is the authoritative 
work on the modern FBI. Its findings led to the dismissal of William Sessions as 
FBI director over his abuses.</p>



<p>Having probed the CIA and FBI, Kessler was 
prepared to take on the modern White House. INSIDE THE WHITE HOUSE: The Hidden 
Lives of the Modern Presidents and the Secrets of the World’s Most Powerful 
Institution depicts what the presidents and first families are really like and 
how the White House really operates, as seen by the Secret Service, Air Force 
One stewards, and White House aides and residence staff who know the true story.</p>



<p>Kessler’s tenth book, THE SINS OF THE FATHER: 
Joseph P. Kennedy and the Dynasty He Founded, is the first major biography of 
Joe Kennedy in more than thirty years. Based in part on the only interview ever 
given by the surgeon who performed the lobotomy on her, the book reveals that 
for political reasons, Joe Kennedy covered up the fact that his daughter 
Rosemary was mentally ill rather than retarded, as the family has long claimed. 
The book documents payoffs Kennedy made to win the presidency for Jack. And it 
reveals an affair with his Hyannis Port secretary that lasted nine years—three 
times longer than his affair with movie star Gloria Swanson.</p>



<p>Kessler’s latest book, THE TERRORIST WATCH: 
Inside the Desperate Race to Stop the Next Attack, presents the chilling story 
of terrorists’ relentless efforts to mount another devastating attack on the 
United States and of the heroic efforts being made to stop those plots. Drawing 
on unprecedented access, the book takes readers inside the war rooms of this 
battle for our survival—from the newly created National Counterterrorism Center 
to FBI headquarters, from the CIA to the National Security Agency, from the 
Pentagon to the Oval Office—to explain why we have gone so long since 9/11 
without a successful attack and to reveal the many close calls we never hear 
about.</p>



<p>Kessler and the book 
were featured on

The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.</p>



Kessler is chief Washington correspondent of
Newsmax.com,&nbsp;a web site with an average of 4.1 
million unique visitors a month, and of Newsmax magazine, which has a readership 
of 600,000. His stories for Newsmax have included interviews with President 
Bush, Donald Trump,&nbsp;Andy Card, Gen. Michael Hayden, Mitt Romney, Sen. Joseph 
Lieberman, Lynne Cheney, Dana Perino, Jim Cramer, Deborah Norville, Robert S. 
Mueller III, Margaret Spellings, Brian Lamb, Juan Williams, Jeb Bush, and Fran 
Townsend. Kessler's

Newsmax stories were instrumental in bringing to light Barack Obama's 
association with his radical minister, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. You can 
sign up for Kessler’s reports <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/kessler/">here</a>.

<p>Kessler has won sixteen journalism awards, 
including two George Polk awards—one for national reporting and one for 
community service. He won the top prize for business and financial reporting 
given by the Washington chapter of the Sigma Delta Chi society of professional 
journalists. Kessler has also won the American Political Science Association’s 
Public Affairs Reporting Award, the Associated Press’ Sevellon Brown Memorial 
Award, and Washingtonian magazine’s Washingtonian of the Year award. He is 
listed in Who’s Who in America.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>

Dave Rosenak 
is a successful Chicago&nbsp;executive, who has given a lot of thought to issues that 
the candidates are clearly avoiding - issues that are of major concern to all of 
us. Rosenak decided to take a proactive approach and offer some possible 
solutions of his own, all colorfully chronicled in his new book, <b><i>Running 
Amok</i></b>.</p>

<p>In a recent radio interview, 
Rosenak commented, <i>&quot;We must hold our presidential candidates' feet to the 
fire when it comes to viable solutions to the problems America faces today. Our 
forefathers established a government that was <b>FOR and BY THE PEOPLE</b>. The 
presidential candidates must take note of those issues that effect us all. <b>We</b> 
must become proactive in examining ways to control our borders. <b>We</b> must 
become proactive in solving our fuel crisis and helping our government discover 
renewable and affordable fuel resources. <b>We</b> cannot accept the failed 
policies of the past on such issues as immigration reform and health care, and
<b>We</b> must require that the next president take a more effective approach in 
his or her foreign policies, and do everything possible to improve the image of 
our country that has become so blemished after entering the war in Iraq.<b> We</b>
</i><i>must demand from our congressmen 
and women that we put an end to the spending of the illions of dollars that 
taxpayers fork out on disputes for, and with other nations, while we ignore 
issues of importancehere at home, like poverty, health care and education. <b>We</b> 
do nothing when major corporations lay off thousands of American's to outsource 
manufacturing and customer services with countries who cannot even speak our 
language. <b>We</b> must do something to insure that generations to come will 
not inherit our sad legacy, or face an insurmountable mountain of debt!&quot;</i></p>
<p>John Avlon is author of <i>Independent Nation: How 
Centrists Can Change American Politics </i>[Random House, 2005]. He served as 
Chief Speechwriter and Deputy Policy Director for Rudy Giuliani's 2008 
Presidential Campaign. Previously, he was a columnist and associate editor for 
the <i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>Avlon was the youngest and longest-serving speechwriter in 
Mayor Giuliani's City Hall. After the attacks of September 11th, 2001, he and 
his team were responsible for writing the eulogies for all firefighters, police 
officers and emergency workers killed in the destruction of the World Trade 
Center. His essay on the attacks, &quot;The Resilient City” concluded the anthology
<i>Empire City: New York through the Centuries</i> and won acclaim as “the 
single best essay written in the wake of 9/11.” </p>

<p>Avlon has appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Fox 
News, CNN, MSNBC, PBS, and C-Span. He has spoken at the Yale, the Citadel, the 
Kennedy School of Government, the State Department&quot;s visiting journalist 
program, and civic organizations around the nation. </p>

<p>In a profile, author Stephen Marshall wrote “Avlon talks 
about politics the way ESPN anchors wrap up sports highlights.” Columnist

<b>Elbie Powers (R) Governor<br/></b>
<p>Born, July 2, 1951 
raised and worked on the farm in Robeson county, NC. Share cropping. Graduated from St.Pauls High 
School 1968.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Becky who works as 
a&nbsp;school teacher in Macon county public schools. After her 33 years of teaching 
school, a very noble profession, today being her very last day of teaching. As 
of today Feb. 29<sup>th</sup> 08' she retires (Leap year day, so she leaped 
out). To you Becky, Congratulations Honey, job well done. You have paid your 
dues well. </p>



<p>I currently own a small farm 
in eastern NC of Sampson county. In 1996 I discontinued row crop farming, 
cotton, wheat, soybeans switching over to a Pecan orchard consisting of just 
under 1000 pecan trees. Aerial view of farm in 06'. I produce, process and store 
all pecans on my farm directing selling to the consumer, restaurant's, bakery's 
etc. My building where I process all pecans is called &quot;The Nut House, Inc&quot;. Yes 
I will be the first Governor straight from the Nut House.....</p>



<p>Why the run for Governor!!!</p>



<p>I feel current politicians are 
out of touch with the working class in NC and the United States. They continue 
to penalize working people for succeeding in life by way of more taxes, while 
they load our wagons, tell us to pull,&nbsp;many&nbsp;people jump on for the ride. If 
you,&nbsp;put me at the Governors desk for four years I will hands down out perform 
any other candidate regarding tax relief. I feel politicians come by each four 
years trying to tell us they are one of us. I also think the working people 
should have a safety net and am checking into this (your ideas welcomed). If an 
elected official does not stand behind their campaign platform, we taxpayers 
should have a way of replacing them at the half way mark of their term. I ask 
you, please help get the word out, just compare my plans, to ALL the other 
candidates. </p>

<p>Peterson established the annual &quot;National Day of Repudiation of
Jesse 
Jackson? event. He is a member of the advisory board of
Project 21, 
an African American

conservative organization, and former board member of the California

Christian Coalition.</p>

<p>On 
January 17, 2006, 
Peterson was a party to the case <i>Jesse Lee Peterson, et al., v. Jesse 
Jackson, et al. (BC 266505),</i> in Los Angeles County Superior Court, after a 
ruling the previous week by Judge George H. Wu. Judicial Watch filed the lawsuit 
against Jackson, his son Jonathan, and others on behalf of Rev. Jesse Lee 
Peterson, who was the alleged victim of a physical and verbal assault at an 
event hosted by Jackson's

Rainbow/PUSH Coalition and

Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. in December 2001. On January 27, 2006, a 
Los Angeles jury rejected Peterson's claim that Jesse Jackson had threatened him 
at a business meeting four years ago. The jury also found Jonathan Jackson did 
not hit Peterson, but split evenly (six to six) on whether he threatened an 
assault.</p>

<p>On 
September 21, 2005 
Peterson penned a column for

WorldNetDaily, in which he suggested that some of the

African-American people stranded in

New Orleans during

Hurricane Katrina were &quot;welfare-pampered,&quot; &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;immoral.&quot; Peterson 
also criticized

New Orleans mayor
Ray Nagin 
for blaming President

George W. Bush for his lack of response to the crisis, stating that 
&quot;responsibility to perform legally and practically fell first on the Mayor of 
New Orleans.&quot; </p>

<p>On 
February 28, 2006, 
as a member of a student panel discussion at the

University of California, Irvine on the

Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Peterson stated that 
extremist Muslims hate America.&nbsp; The event was sponsored by the

United American Committee and

College Republicans, and gained national attention for the controversy and 
confrontation associated with it.</p>

<p>Peterson is also a member of

Choose Black America, an organization of African Americans who oppose

illegal immigration.</p>

<p>Peterson has recently made headlines after his call for support of 
controversial reality television host,
Duane 
&quot;Dog&quot; Chapman.</p>

GA teaching a graduate course on privacy and public policy; and he serves as a

<br/>

			<title>Fox News analyst and Newsday columnist Ellis Henican &amp; AM talk radio host Mark Williams</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/fox-news-analyst-and-newsday-columnist-ellis-henican-am-talk-radio-host-mark-williams]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><font face="Arial">Ellis Henican has the most diverse portfolio of anyone 
working in American journalism today. He is a staff columnist for Newsday, a 
political analyst at the Fox News Channel and the host of a nationally 
syndicated <a href="http://crni.net/default.aspx?date=9/16/2007&nid=7&pid=0&eid=232">weekend show</a> on the Talk Radio Network. He is also the voice of 
“Stormy? on the hit Cartoon Network series, “<a href="http://www.adultswim.com/shows/sealab/">Sealab 2021</a>.? </font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">Henican’s award-winning newspaper column -- a personal, 
opinionated look at the news of the day – appears in the paper’s front news 
section every Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Working from Newsday’s Manhattan 
newsroom, he specializes in finding the human angle inside the news. His work 
puts him in the middle of politics, business, crime, race and the occasional 
tabloid silliness. One day, he is writing from the campaign trail. The next, 
he’s digging into a scandal in New York or poking fun at some self-important 
celebrity. Before taking on his current assignment, Henican wrote Newsday’s 
subway column, leading the paper to a Pulitzer Prize for the Union Square train 
wreck. </font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">In recent years, Henican has built a strong presence on TV 
and radio, appearing on most of the major broadcast and cable networks. He is in 
his sixth year under contract to the Fox News Channel, where he is a regular 
fixture on the network’s prime-time, early-morning and mid-day shows. He also 
fills in as a guest host. At Fox, Henican is known for his lively take on the 
news and for dissecting complex issue in an engaging way. He has been an 
integral part of network’s coverage of the Sept. 11th terror attacks, the 
Clinton impeachment, Election 2004 and virtually every other significant news 
story of the past six years. His early television experience included co-hosting 
a weekly transit program on New York-1, the city’s all-news channel. His weekly 
“Culture Clash? segments -- an irreverent look at television, movies and 
pop-culture trends – were a popular daytime feature on the USA Network. </font>
</p>



<p><font face="Arial">Henican has become a familiar voice on talk radio in New 
York and across America. His new national weekend program, “The Ellis Henican 
Show,? is syndicated by the Talk Radio Network and heard in several dozen of the 
nation’s top markets. Each Saturday afternoon, Henican delivers a fast-paced, 
two-hour romp through the news – local, national, serious, silly and those 
maddeningly little stories that bug everyone. Before launching his current show, 
Henican had a 10-year run as a talk host and daily commentator at Bloomberg 
Radio in New York. On the lighter side, Henican provides the voice for Derek 
“Stormy? Waters, a good-looking but decidedly dim crewman on “Sealab 2021.? Now 
in its fourth season, the popular animated program airs Sunday nights on the 
Cartoon Network as part of the “Adult Swim? programming bloc. </font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">Henican is a sought-after public speaker. His articles 
have been published in various national magazines, including The New Republic, 
Cosmopolitan and Penthouse. He has ghost-written two books for Simon &amp; Schuster 
-- an inside account of the nation’s largest drug-treatment program and a 
best-selling motivational business book. His work has been recognized with the 
Meyer Berger Award for Distinguished Writing About New York City, the National 
Clarion Award for Column Writing and shares of two Pulitzer Prizes for Spot 
News. </font></p>



<p><font face="Arial">Born in Virginia and raised in New Orleans, Henican earned 
a bachelor’s degree in political science from Hampshire College. He has a 
master’s degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, 
where he won the top student prize, the Pulitzer Traveling Fellowship. He began 
his career as a reporter at the Kentucky Post and the Albany (N.Y.) 
Knickerbocker News.</font></p>


<p><font face="Arial">Make sure to check out both his <a href="http://www.wor710.com/pages/46357.php">HD radio show</a> and <a href="http://www.henican.com/portal/index.php">homepage</a>.</font></p>

<p>Mark Williams is an opinion journalist. He is based in <font face="Arial">
<a title="Sacramento, California" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento,_California" style="text-decoration: none;">
<font color="#ffffff">Sacramento</font></a>,
<a title="California" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California" style="text-decoration: none;">
<font color="#ffffff">California</font></a></font>. Williams is a regular 
contributor to Fox News Channel, MSNBC and Court TV and writes a newspaper 
column for the new Sacramento Union newspaper. Additionally he has filled in for 
radio talk hosts on a number of radio outlets.</p>


<p>He coined the term &quot;Hildebeast&quot; and uses it on TV, in print and on the radio 
to refer to Hillary Clinton. While extremely supportive of the invasion of Iraq 
(and an advocate of invading Iran while suggesting that Mecca also be &quot;high on 
our list&quot;), and out in front of the movement to deport illegal aliens, he also 
supports same sex marriage, stating that a true conservative believes that the 
government should leave people's bedrooms alone. He is very active in raising 
funds for pet shelters and adoption efforts. His dog, &quot;Casey the pound dog&quot; 
often appears when he shows up to protest Arnold Schwarzenegger (for whom he 
coined the term &quot;Schwarzenkennedy&quot;). Casey has also appeared on TV as a &quot;spokesdog&quot; 
for animal adoptions.</p>


<p>Williams led listeners on a lobbying trip to Capitol Hill in a drive to 
support immigration reform. In 2005 he and his wife (Holly) traveled to Iraq and 
broadcast several shows from various locations around Baghdad.</p>


<p>In June 2007 Williams formed MarkTalk LLC, an Internet-based, on-demand 
content delivery project anchored by his own daily Podcast and incorporating 
Podcasts, Web streams and Internet Radio from other professional journalists; 
interactive audio, video and text commentary.&nbsp; Check out his show, <i>The

third part of the Civil War trilogy written by Michael Shaara and
his son Jeffrey
Shaara, <i>The Last Full Measure</i>, is a project currently waiting for
financial backing, since the bankroller of the first two parts, Ted Turner, backed
out following the poor reception of <i>Gods and Generals</i>.&nbsp; This may be
due in part to the media's reaction to United States Senator, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Allen_(U.S._politician)">George Allen</a> (Republican-Virginia) and Senator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Byrd">Robert Byrd</a> <u>(</u>Democrat-West

Texas Senator Phil Gramm appears as a member of the Virginia
Legislature early in the film.</p>

			<title>Third Rail with author Steve Young and Mayor Chad Foster</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/third-rail-with-author-steve-young-and-mayor-chad-foster]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[Don't miss this hilarious interview with Steve Young, a former stand-up comedian, whos social and political satire 
is recognized as some of the funniest, yet still poignant, observations with his 
stories regularly gracing the op-ed pages of major newspapers across the country 
and&nbsp;placing&nbsp;Steve in demand as&nbsp;a TV &quot;pundit&quot; on networks&nbsp;such as the <em>Fox 
News Channel </em>and <em>CNN, </em>as well as appearing on <em>The Today Show, 
Connie Chung </em>and <em>Good Morning America</em>.<br/><p>As contributing editor at the Writer Guild Of America’s &quot;Written By&quot; 
magazine, Steve’s reputation has given him serious entrance to the best writers 
and producers in the industry while also allowing him one more outlet to lampoon 
the entertainment business he cares so much about. </p>



<p>No matter what the venue, Steve always seems to be creating something unique 
and important.&nbsp; In TV he has written for <em>Boy Meets World, Cybill, The Smart 
Guy </em>and (the new) <em>Family Affair, </em>as well as 
being&nbsp;acknowledged&nbsp;with the Prism Award and a Humanitas nomination.&nbsp; </p>



<p>As a film director/writer Steve turned the power brokers of Hollywood on 
their funny bones with his biting/satirical film, <em>My Dinner With Ovitz </em>
(<a href="http://www.mydinnerwithovitz.com/">www.mydinnerwithovitz.com</a>). </p>



<p>As an&nbsp;author of the inspiring &quot;<a href="http://www.greatfailure.com/content/blogsection/2/3/">Great 
Failures Of The Extremely Successful</a>&quot; (Tallfellow Press, Sept 2002)&nbsp;he was 
able to get the greats of many different fields to share their remarkable 
stories of adversity. Of &quot;Great Failures...&quot;, Jack Canfield, co-creator of 
&quot;Chicken Soup For The Soul,&quot; said, &quot;<em>When you finish reading this amazing 
book, you will never let failure or fear of failure stand in your way again</em>.&quot;
</p>



<p>Steve has more than shown his grasp of creating stories and characters that 
both entertain and enlighten (without it being <em>jammed</em> down our 
children’s throats). &nbsp;Executive editor, Rosemary Brosnan of his whacked-out 
novel, &quot;130 Tales of Winchell Mink&quot; (Harper Collins 2004), &quot;...it's one of the 
funniest and freshest manuscripts I've ever read.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;15 Minutes&quot; 
(Harper&nbsp;Collins, 2005),&nbsp;another fun adventure novel, will follow.</p>


<p align="left">Also, be sure to also check out the second half of the show with Chad Foster, Mayor of the City of Eagle Pass, Texas and also the President of the Texas Border Coalition.&nbsp; Eagle Pass has 
been sued by the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._government" title="U.S. government">
U.S. government</a> for access to land to construct a border fence between the 
United States and Mexico.</p>



<p align="left">Mayor Foster's organization was founded in 1998, when 
communities throughout the Texas Border Region came together&nbsp;to form the Texas 
Border Infrastructure Coalition (TBIC) to develop key recommendations for the 
76th Texas Legislature. Cities, counties, workforce development organizations, 
community colleges, universities, and hundreds of individuals participated in 
subcommittees charges with the responsibilities of developing strategies to 
address the infrastructure needs of the region. </p>



<p align="justify">Today, the organization&nbsp;is known as the
<a href="http://www.texasbordercoalition.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=25&Itemid=41">
Texas Border Coalition</a> (TBC) and it continues to be a&nbsp;collective voice of 
border mayors, county judges, and communities on issues that affect Texas-Mexico 
board region quality of&nbsp;life. TBC's vision is to be recognized leader and 
authority for the Texas-Mexico region in order to bring attention to the 
infrastructure needs of the communities along the border. </p>

            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/third-rail-with-the-minuteman-project-founder-jim-gilchrist]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jim Gilchrist founded the multi-ethnic 
Minuteman Project on Oct. 1, 2004, after years of frustrated efforts trying to 
get a neglectful U.S. government to simply enforce existing immigration laws.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jim holds a B.A. in newspaper journalism, a 
B.S. in business administration, and an M.B.A. in taxation. He is a former 
newspaper reporter and a retired California CPA (Certified Public Accountant).</span></p>



<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Jim is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and 
recipient of the Purple Heart award for wounds sustained while serving with an 
infantry unit in Vietnam, 1968 - 1969.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mr. Gilchrist is a passionate defender of the 
First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and an avid supporter of law 
enforcement organizations. He has appeared on over 1000 radio and TV news and 
commentary shows in the past twelve months, and he believes he is only one of 
millions of 21st century minutemen / women / children who want the U.S. to 
remain governed by the “rule of law? and who want proactive enforcement of our 
national security protections and our immigration legal code.&nbsp; </span></p>

			<title>Third Rail with Presidential Candidate Senator Mike Gravel and author Dr. Darrell Bock</title>
            <link><![CDATA[http://thirdrail.libsyn.com/third-rail-with-presidential-candidate-senator-mike-gravel-and-author-dr-darrell-bock]]></link>
            <description><![CDATA[

<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Exclusive interview with current Democratic
presidential candidate, Senator Mike Gravel.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Gravel served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963-66, and
as Speaker from 1965-66. He then represented Alaska in the U.S. Senate from
1969-81. He served on the Finance, Interior, and Environmental and Public Works
committees, chairing the Energy, Water Resources, Buildings and Grounds, and
Environmental Pollution subcommittees.</span></p>





<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">In 1971,&nbsp;he waged a successful one-man
filibuster for five months that forced the Nixon administration to cut a deal,
effectively ending the draft in the United States. He is most prominently
known&nbsp;for his&nbsp;release of the Pentagon Papers, the secret official
study that revealed the lies and manipulations&nbsp;of successive U.S.
administrations that misled the country into&nbsp;the Vietnam War. After the
New York Times published portions of the leaked study, the Nixon administration
moved to block any further publication of information and to punish any
newspaper publisher who revealed the contents. </span></p>





<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">From the floor of the senate, Gravel (a
junior senator at the time) insisted that his constituents had a right to know
the truth behind the war&nbsp;and proceeded to read 4,100 pages of the 7,000
page document into the senate record. The&nbsp;Supreme Court ultimately ruled
that Senator Gravel did not have the right and responsibility to share official
documents with his constituents.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>





<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">He then&nbsp;published <em>The Senator
Gravel Edition, The Pentagon Papers, </em>Beacon Press (1971). This
publication&nbsp;resulted in&nbsp;litigation, Gravel v. U.S., resulting in a
landmark Supreme Court decision (No. 71-1017-1026) relative to the Speech and
Debate Clause (Article 1, Section 6) of the United States Constitution. </span></p>





<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He has worked as a cab
driver in New York City, a clerk on Wall Street and as a brakeman on the Alaska
Railroad. He founded and served as president of The Democracy Foundation,
Philadelphia II, and Direct Democracy, nonprofit corporations dedicated to the
establishment of direct democracy in the United States through the enactment of
the National Initiative for Democracy by American voters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>







<span class="customerinfoheader"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Also
check out our interview with author Dr. Darrell L. Bock Ph.D. </span></span><span class="customerinfo"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">research professor of
New Testament Studies at Dallas Theological Seminary has written several books
including <i>The Missing Gospels</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> best seller,
<i>Breaking the Da Vinci Code</i>. Bock is simultaneously the Professor for
Spiritual Development and Culture for the Center for Christian Leadership, as
well as being editor at large for <i>Christianity Today</i>. He also served as
a past president of the Evangelical Theological Society.</span></span>]]></description>
