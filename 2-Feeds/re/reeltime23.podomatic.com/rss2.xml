Well the newest edition to the, we will say &quot;saga&quot;, is The Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, starring James Franco, and Frieda Pinto, at least as far as the human stars are concerned, in our opinion the Ape Caesar, is the real star in the film played by Andy Serkis.  As you guessed we where surprised  and kind of disappointed by the lack of poop being tossed by the monkeys, but give REEL TIME latest PODCAST a listen and see what we really think of the movie.
