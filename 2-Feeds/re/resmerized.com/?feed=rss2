			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yes even I am guilty of giving myself too much to do lately. However in my own defense, I was fortunate to be given a few opportunities all at once practically, within a short period of time anyway. Sometimes you just have to do what you gotta do and know that when your intuition says &#8220;this is not coming around again any time soon if ever&#8221; you&#8217;d best listen! So I did. </p>
<p>Listening translates into taking some classes and learning some skills I&#8217;ve long wanted to learn. Even one that was a real personal coup for me, numerology. I had always been one of those &#8216;numbers and I agree to disagree&#8217; people. However, this time, when faced with learning formulas and then applying them to a particular name or situation, then interpreting the whole thing, proved to be so very interesting that I was compelled to tell the voices in my head that said &#8216;this is too hard&#8217;, to shut the heck up and stop trying to tell me what to do dammit! I have a new love for numbers now. You have no idea what a big deal that is for me.</p>
<p>So with my recently acquired advanced certifications in Numerology, Law Of Attraction Practitioner, Life Coaching, Neuro Linguistic Programming and even Hypnotherapy, this is me being ultra excited about offering my services to you in new and wonderful ways. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m needing to take time this week and next, to focus on studying for my numerology certification and giving readings more as well. As you know if you&#8217;ve been lovingly stalking me, I&#8217;m big on anyone who claims to be a psychic/spiritual counselor or light worker putting their own time and money where their mouth is, i.e. expanding their knowledge and abilities when the opportunity arises. Too many online practitioners are nothing more than someone who bought a few books, a deck of cards or what have you, claim to &#8216;see things&#8217; when all they&#8217;re really doing is playing parlor games for money with the audacity to call themselves professionals.  Can you tell that makes me angry? lol It DOES. Therefore, I resolve to &#8216;put up or shut up&#8217; in my own practice.</p>
<p>That said, the opportunity has arisen for me to invest in myself and my service to others by taking an intense course in numerology, leading to certification, adding to the others I worked hard to achieve.  And yes, I am proud of what I&#8217;ve done so far because I am my own support system on many levels and well, I&#8217;m no spring chicken buster! (I may be older but I&#8217;m growing more and more dangerous;)</p>
<p>There are very few opportunities for any spiritual worker to gain any sort of credentials. There are a few that will &#8216;certify&#8217; or &#8216;license&#8217; you for a fee with no instruction or mentoring whatsoever. I cannot in good concience woos out to not really knowing what I&#8217;m talking about. Knowledge is power, but knowledge is also worth the effort to me personally.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to trust me with your life and future, I intend to be worthy of it. I hereby challenge any and all other online psychics, healers, teachers, spiritual advisors of any kind, to do the same.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of my journey as so many of you have thus far. Get Resmerized Live will return in two week&#8217;s time. You can find me online for readings as usual.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every now and then I get an email or message from someone who either is a professional reader or someone who would like to be, asking my personal opinion of, and about my experiences with various psychic reading sites online. So in that vein, I decided it might be helpful to post about some of the things I&#8217;ve experienced and learned.</p>
<p>Things change rapidly in the online psychic world. Many readers will contract with several sites in order to be able to make a living wage or better, especially if they are the sole breadwinner in their household. In these challenging economic times, sadly that is often the case. The ethical ones do this for a living because they&#8217;ve answered a calling and are blessed to find ways to incorporate their gifts and services into being self employed. However, its hard work. As anyone who is self employed in ANY capacity will tell you, its often necessary to put in MORE hours than people with 9 to 5 jobs do because we&#8217;re not paid by the hour or on a fixed salary. We also do most of our own marketing and webmastering too, a constant effort for most of us.</p>
<p>So, when we show up bright faced and eager to share with you what you need to know about your life, questions you have, how to make your life or situation better, chances are you&#8217;re talking or chatting with someone who works at it ALL the time. That said, we are also dealing with making sure we&#8217;re working with sites that don&#8217;t waste our time. We NEED to know what&#8217;s what on the net.</p>
<p>Recently I&#8217;ve decided I really need to streamline my efforts and figure out what works best when and where for me, as far as earning a living online doing what I love. A psychic reader or spiritual advisor may work with one or two sites for years, yet there will inevitably come a time when that particular site just isn&#8217;t getting the traffic it once did. Such has been the case with me over the last couple years. Fluctuations in traffic are a constant and when it takes a nosedive, so does my income.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll begin this overall review of my own experiences with the very first website I started giving readings via chat, and that is <a href="http://www.kajama.com" target="_blank">Kajama.com</a>. This site started out being called Psychicchat.com but changed its domain name a few years ago. I don&#8217;t really know why but if anyone asked me, I would totally NOT have done that! lol However, the fact that changing its name didn&#8217;t make it go away, and that most of the psychics who started with them are still there (including me) 11 years later, they&#8217;re doing something right. That something is, real experienced accurate advisors and psychics, yet not tons of them. This though is not a place where I can spend all of my time and expect to earn enough to disregard any other site. When I first started with them in 1999, it was. But then it was one of two sites who did chat room readings at the time. Now there&#8217;s a BUNCH.</p>
<p><em>~ Pros for Readers: Always pays on time and accurately, set your own schedule and price, quality clientele, use chat, phone, cam or all three, owner responds quickly to issues. Email to inquire about being contracted.<br />
~ Pros for Clients: Don&#8217;t have to wade through tons of readers, readers tested for ability, experienced only accepted, prompt customer service.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.psychicaccess.com" target="_blank">PsychicAccess.com</a> also holds my loyalty. It is owned and operated by Mr. Doug Christman, someone who created and ran the first online psychic reading site to offer the ability to see your psychic read live via a webcam. This site has consistently been a joy to work with because the psychics are made to feel that we are understood, what we need in order to work confidently and smoothly, and focus on what we offer, never what we &#8216;sell&#8217;, like some other sites require. We are only required to genuinely offer our services, not &#8216;upsell&#8217; any other products or services. That makes it possible for us to maintain professional integrity. Trust me, any real working psychic doesn&#8217;t WANT to be a sales person or they&#8217;d be one.</p>
<p><em>~ Pros for Readers: Always pays on time and accurately (several methods to choose from), choose your own schedule and price, can offer email, phone, video chat readings and free chat time, can keep in touch with clients, owner ALWAYS accessible. You can choose to give readings via live video chat, telephone, or both. <a href="http://psychicaccess.com/employment/" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn about employment.<br />
~ Pros for Clients: Don&#8217;t have to wade through tons of readers, readers are expected to have experience, proven accuracy, genuine abilities, &amp; treat clients well. Client issues are heard and responded to by the owner and customer service quickly. Variety of price ranges to suit everyone. You can see and hear your psychic, &amp; chat with them before you pay for a private reading.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.psychicslive.com/live/resmyrranda/" target="_blank">PsychicsLive.com</a> is a relatively new online reading site. I enjoy working with this site because the owners make it a breeze. They&#8217;ve given their psychics multiple tools for self promotion, a forum for both psychics and clients to interact, and its just so much fun meeting people from all over the world. Its evident they are spending time and money on promotion. With a domain name like PsychicsLive.com, you can&#8217;t really go wrong! Its not saturated with tons of readers yet so while there aren&#8217;t alot of choices for clients, its also been easy to form lasting relationships and we just have a great time chatting with participants about all things psychic and paranormal.</p>
<p><em>~Pros for Readers: Clients can hear, see and chat with you; via desktop software or through your browser. Cam and audio quality is stellar. Pays on time a variety of ways, twice a month. Set your own rates.Traffic is increasing consistently.</em> <a href="http://www.psychicslive.com/apply/" target="_blank">Click here to apply</a>.<br />
<em> ~Pros for Clients: Chat free, see and hear your psychic as often as you like before you get a private reading. Registering for free, with a credit or debit card gets you free credits for a reading, and enables you to enter the chatroom at any time. (Other types of accounts may not enter at any time if the psychic blocks unregistered users due to abuse; an option each psychic has.)</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.oranum.com/psychics/Resmyrranda" target="_blank">Oranum</a> has been around for over a year now but I just recently signed up with them for a few reasons; they also offer live video chat rooms where you can see, hear, and chat with us for free before you get a private reading. This is truly an international site with every type of reader and advisor there is. Yes there are over a thousand to choose from on this site but not all of them are online all the time of course. Traffic on this site is through the roof so you&#8217;re always going to meet lots of new people and as a result, be able to help lots of people from EVERYWHERE. I LOVE this aspect. The psychics are well supported by staff that is online via skype at all times. Lots of promotional tools given and lots of promotion happening. The site and the software is as professional as it gets. Nothing cheesy about the setup. There&#8217;s even a couple guys in the UK who read in tandem sometimes using a large ouija board table! You know I luv that. lol Oranum is fun for all and a wonderful venue for psychics and advisors.</p>
<p><em>~Pros for Readers: They pay on time a variety of ways, twice a month. You are supported 24/7. Cam and chat software to use via your desktop or browser, set your own rates. Multiple promotional tools and mega traffic.</em> <a href="http://registration.oranum.com/master_account.php?partner=Resmyrranda" target="_blank">Click here to register as a reader</a>.<br />
<em> ~Pros for Clients: Free registration, see, hear and chat with your psychic free as long and as often as you like before you get a private reading. Schedule a reading too or get an email reading instead.</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way I could talk about all the sites on the net that offer psychic readings in all their various forms, but having worked with just about everyone over the years, some very briefly, I can say that the above sites have been consistently worth my time and effort, and have been places where I feel my own credibility and reputation are never compromised.</p>
<p>Be very very very picky about where you go to get a reading and spend your hard earned money, as well as what sites you sign on with to work. That may sound simplistic but when you are feeling scared, worried, sad, desperate or lonely, and we all do now and then, its alot easier to be taken advantage of by someone, especially if you are also trying to find a work from home opportunity as well; same advice applies. The opportunities to be scammed online are legion. Some of the sites that have been around for years, like Live Person (formerly Kasamba), and Keen, are so over crowded and overused, it will take you months to build a clientele and even cost you money in bids to get your profile seen or like Live Person, cost you a fee to even get started. Then, marketing is STILL up to you. Bitwine is another popular site for readers to signup with but they do not test anyone, which means anyone can sign up, real or fake. A fee applies there as well but its up to you to pay it at the end of each pay period.</p>
<p>One more thing you should be aware of if you&#8217;re looking for online work as a reader or advisor; Lately there has been what I call a &#8216;rash&#8217; of people who have been online readers and advisors, gotten fed up with the sites they were working on because of their own lack of experience, maturity and professionalism, so out of spite and &#8220;I can do this better than any of you&#8221; mentality, they start their own site. ANYONE can pay someone else to build a site, then pay a media company to provide cam and chat software, set it all up on a domain name, get a few inexperienced and/or discontented readers from other sites to sign on with them,  and voila they&#8217;re in business. I have no problem whatsoever with anyone starting their own online business. I do however want to point out that it will take some time and money put into a venture like that for at least a year before it would be worth expecting to earn a living wage from. Just because you&#8217;ve got the shiny new &#8216;thing&#8217; and others want to play too doesn&#8217;t mean anything. The proof is always in the pudding and edible pudding takes time and money, no exceptions. As a reader and advisor myself, I implore you, ASK QUESTIONS of a site and site owner before you signup. Do your due diligence in research by using tools like Alexa to check them out, google names and places, use whois.com to find out who the real owners are, then google them. Ask other readers who work on their site what its like for them. Hang out on their sites to see what&#8217;s what, what kinds of things they offer, how things work. And something that is really VERY telling, is their copy. What does it say on their first page? Does it put down other sites or other readers making themselves sound like they&#8217;re the &#8216;IT&#8217; site to be on and all the others are fakes? Does their copy make sense? Do you get a positive feeling from reading their pages and psychic profiles? Does it look cheap and homemade? Really LOOK and read it over well. You can tell if someone is mad at the whole industry and trying to make other psychics look bad or whether or not they&#8217;re true professional guides and counselors with ethics and experience.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said alot here I know and couldn&#8217;t possibly cover it all but please do ask me any questions you have, by commenting below. This is a discussion I&#8217;m happy to have always. Thank you and happy readings on both sides of the screen.;)</p>
