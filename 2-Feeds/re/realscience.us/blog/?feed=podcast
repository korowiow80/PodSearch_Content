			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="http://eplayer.clipsyndicate.com/embed/iframe?pf_id=1&#038;show_title=0&#038;va_id=3502949&#038;windows=1" width="425" height="330"></iframe></p>
<p>Potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) are orbiting space rocks that come within five million miles of Earth. As you can imagine, there are a lot of asteroids that qualify as regionally or globally dangerous.</p>
<p>And two sizable asteroids narrowly missed Earth at the end of May, one zipping less than 10,000 miles away from us. <div id="attachment_7178" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/AsteroidinfrontofEarth.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/AsteroidinfrontofEarth-e1339011014357.jpg" alt="Small Asteroid Zips by Earth, May 30, 2012" title="AsteroidinfrontofEarth" width="325" height="220" class="size-full wp-image-7178" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Small Asteroid Zips by Earth, May 30, 2012</p></div></p>
<p>A 16-foot asteroid discovered on Memorial Day whizzed past Earth just 8,950 miles from Earth&#8217;s surface. That&#8217;s a very close call. NASA&#8217;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which tracks such flybys, said the asteroid — dubbed <a href="http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2012%20KT42;orb=0;cov=0;log=0;cad=0#orb">2012 KT42</a> — was the sixth closest asteroid approach.</p>
<p>And it was the second asteroid encounter during the last week of May. On May 28, another asteroid, measuring 69 feet across, flew by at a distance of 32,000 miles.</p>
<p>Because these dark-colored space rocks appear inky black against the darkness of space, it is very difficult to spot an asteroid until it gets really close to Earth or until the sun shines on it to reveal its size and shape. Unfortunately, those are the space rocks that stand a greater chance of crashing into Earth.</p>
<p>The good news is that a direct collision happens about twice every million years. So it&#8217;s rather unlikely that anyone living today will experience an asteroid hitting Earth. But there are some long-range projections of big asteroids that regularly intersect Earth&#8217;s orbit that will squeak by, much like the two asteroids that buzzed us at the end of May.</p>
<p>NASA has its <a href="http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/">Near Earth Objects office</a> that monitors asteroids, including PHAs that threaten Earth. Telescope operators located in Hawaii and a couple of other places point powerful telescopes at suspect objects, including NEOs as requested by NASA and the European Space Agency.</p>
<p>Because the sky is a big place and professional astronomers are far outnumbered by potential objects in space, NASA is enlisting the help of amateur astronomers and citizen scientists to help sift through mountains of data, identify NEOs and even act as an early warning system for asteroids that have their sights set on Earth.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7179" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NEAs.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NEAs-e1339011544655.jpg" alt="An Edge-On View of the Solar System. Dots Represent the Population of NEAs and PHAs That Scientists Think Exist Based on the NEOWISE Survey" title="NEAs" width="325" height="243" class="size-full wp-image-7179" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">An Edge-On View of the Solar System. Dots Represent the Population of NEAs and PHAs That Scientists Think Exist Based on the NEOWISE Survey</p></div>Earlier this spring, NASA announced <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2012/apr/HQ12-121_OSIRIS-REx_Outreach_NEOs.html">Target Asteroids!</a>, a new citizen science project designed to support NASA&#8217;s <a href="http://osiris-rex.lpl.arizona.edu/">Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource Identification Security &#8211; Regolith Explorer</a> (OSIRIS-REx) mission scheduled for launch in 2016 that will study material from an asteroid.</p>
<p>Scientists haven&#8217;t been to the different types of asteroids to take geological samples to determine their composition. So much about asteroids, including successful ways to move them out of the way, remain a mystery.</p>
<p>NASA hopes that its new program will excite people about space and science and allow them to participate in a project to classify the population of NEOs, their position, motion, rotation and changes in the intensity of light they emit.</p>
<p><a href="http://osiris-rex.lpl.arizona.edu/targetasteroids.html">Target Asteroids!</a> data will be useful for comparisons with actual mission data. Then professional astronomers can use this refine theoretical models of asteroids and improve their understanding of asteroids similar to the one OSIRIS-Rex will encounter in 2019, designated 1999 RQ36.</p>
<p>OSIRIS-Rex project scientist Jason Dworkin at NASAs Goddard Space Flight Center says, &#8220;Although few amateur astronomers have the capability to observe 1999 RQ36 itself, they do have the capability to observe other targets.&#8221;</p>
<p>And getting better acquainted with asteroids, what they are made of and how they travel will help astronomers select destinations for manned missions to asteroids &#8212; like the one planned for planetoid Vesta. </p>
<p>And ESA is enlisting the power of crowdsourcing to help collect observations about PHAs as part of Europe’s contribution to the global asteroid hunt.</p>
<p>A new project in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.faulkes-telescope.com/">UK’s Faulkes Telescope Project</a> will set students loose tracking NEOs and watching for hazardous asteroids.</p>
<p>ESA’s Space Situational Awareness (SSA) program keeps watch over space hazards, including disruptive space weather, debris objects in Earth orbit and asteroids that pass close enough to cause concern.  </p>
<p>Professional research projects often turn to the armies of amateur astronomers around the world to help with observations or to lend a hand with the vast amounts of data that need processing. And it&#8217;s thanks to initiatives like Faulkes that makes research-grade instruments available that make projects like this viable.</p>
<p>Detlef Koschny, the head of NEO activity at ESAs SSA program office says, &#8220;The wider astronomy community offers a wealth of expertise and enthusiasm, and they have the time and patience to verify new sightings; this helps tremendously.&#8221; </p>
<p>While the Faulkes project focuses on schools, amateurs will be able to freely access the project&#8217;s data archives. ESAs archives are also open to all, and they work with amateur astronomers with the Teide Observatory Tenerife Asteroid Survey (TOTAS) team, who use a 1-meter telescope at the ESAs Optical Ground Station on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. Since starting their SSA-sponsored survey work in January 2010, the TOTAS amateur astronomers have identified hundreds of asteroid candidates, over 20 of which have been confirmed and named.<div id="attachment_7180" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 308px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NewComet.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/NewComet-e1339011924401.jpg" alt="School Children in Northern Ireland Discover New Comet, Only 5AU from Earth, February 2012" title="NewComet" width="298" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-7180" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">School Children in Northern Ireland Discover New Comet, Only 5AU from Earth, February 2012</p></div></p>
<p>And grade school students in Northern Ireland who were studying the positions of six NEOs, identified a never-before-seen comet, for which they received a special mention in a <a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/services/MPEC.html">Minor Planet Electronic Circular</a>, an electronic bulletin reporting urgent results of Near Earth Objects sent out to the astronomical community.</p>
<p>Nick Howes, Pro-Am Programme Manager at the Faulkes Telescope says, &#8220;For European students, collaborating on exciting ESA activities and possibly detecting new NEOs is very appealing, as it&#8217;s engagement with one of the world&#8217;s great space agencies doing critical scientific work.&#8221;</p>
<p>And getting as many eyes on the sky as we can is the best way to identify all potential asteroid threats. Citizen science is probably the best way to accomplish that.</p>

<p>For most of us the planet Mars is just far, far away. And not someplace that many of us envision visiting. But within the next ten years manned missions to the red planet may become possible and even routine. A Dutch television company is banking on Mars becoming a hot, new destination sometime in the early 2020s. And it will create a reality show to mark the historic human move to other planets. <div id="attachment_7164" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MarsOne1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MarsOne1-e1338933453904.jpg" alt="Image of Mars One Habitat" title="MarsOne1" width="325" height="187" class="size-full wp-image-7164" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image of Mars One Habitat</p></div></p>
<p>The company <a href="http://mars-one.com/">Mars One</a> thinks that when the first people land on Mars most of the world will be watching. And it wants to make sure cameras are rolling. But this isn&#8217;t an ordinary reality TV show. Instead of just being sequestered for a short period while producers incite conflict to create juicy dialogue, the lucky winners of this selection process will move to Mars &#8212; permanently. Just think, reality TV stars may be the first to colonize Mars.</p>
<p>Beginning next year the man behind the reality TV success <em>Big Brother</em> and his partners will select several teams of four astronauts each. Then the public will make the final choice to determine the first four people to move to Mars. Each winning contestant will receive a complementary one-way, seven-month trip to the red planet in 2023.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional manned missions, a Mars-to-stay mission is actually less costly. The astronauts only need a one-way trip. And they don&#8217;t have to pack all of their necessary provisions. They just need the tools to be self-sufficient. And creators of the show estimate that will cost about $6 billion. To raise money for the project this revolution will be televised from every angle.</p>
<p>The Mars One website says, &#8220;We see this as a journey that belongs to us all, and it is for this reason that we will make every step one that we take together. This will also be our way to finance the mission: the mission to Mars will be the biggest media event ever!&#8221;</p>
<p>And with all Earthly eyes watching that could be very true. But it&#8217;s still a high-risk project. Reality TV veteran <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&#038;sl=nl&#038;u=http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R%25C3%25B6mer_%28televisieproducent%29&#038;ei=-nPOT8mMFcPs2QXM7InJDA&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=translate&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=2&#038;ved=0CFUQ7gEwAQ&#038;prev=/search%3Fq%3DPaul%2BR%25C3%25B6mer%2B-economist%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DzkM%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26biw%3D1440%26bih%3D707%26prmd%3Dimvnsob">Paul Römer</a> says when the Mars One founders first approached him, asking whether they could discuss a mission to Mars, his first response was &#8220;these people are crazy. What can they do that NASA’s can&#8217;t?&#8221; </p>
<p>But he says, &#8220;That conversation made it clear to me, however. They think so creatively, and outside of the box and the concept of a &#8216;one-way&#8217; mission is both outrageous and exciting.&#8221;</p>
<p>After thinking about it, the reality TV veteran decided to put his name along side an August bunch, including theoretical physicist and Nobel Prize winner <a href="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/">Gerard &#8216;t Hooft</a>, best-selling author <a href="http://www.maryroach.net/books-news.php">Mary Roach</a>, and a couple of Dutch space experts.</p>
<p>Romer was impressed by the team, their plan and the opportunity to have the whole world watch his TV show. he says, &#8220;These aspects are what brought me to the idea of making the mission the biggest media event in the world. Reality meets talent show with no ending and the whole world watching. Now there’s a pitch!&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7168" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 334px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BasLansdorp.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BasLansdorp.jpg" alt="Bas Lansdorp, Founder of Mars One" title="BasLansdorp" width="324" height="237" class="size-full wp-image-7168" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bas Lansdorp, Founder of Mars One</p></div>Bas Lansdorp is the man behind Mars One. Some people like to organize family reunions or big parties. For years, the Dutch entrepreneur has wanted to organize a mission to Mars. </p>
<p>He says, &#8220;This will not be just another reality show. This will be a report on humanity&#8217;s next giant leap.&#8221;</p>
<p>Landsdorp says the mission to Mars is the goal. The media event around it is just the way to make it into a reality. And reality TV.</p>
<p>Lansdorp is a successful mechanical engineer who left his successful company <a href="http://www.ampyxpower.com/">Amypx Power</a> after just three years to join Mars One full time.</p>
<p>Starting next year the world will be able to watch a rigorous selection process as Mars One producers select astronaut candidates who will ultimately spend the next ten years training for a mission to Mars.</p>
<p>The would-be astronauts will face big challenges (which ought to make for good reality TV) as they build skills and prepare to leave Earth forever. </p>
<p>The Mars One website says that four people will leave Earth in September 2022 to embark on a seven-month journey to their new home, Mars. It says, &#8220;Four more will take off in October 2024, who will have started their training years before 2022. As this pattern shows, there will always be several groups training for future missions.&#8221;</p>
<p>By 2030 there will be 20 or so Martian colonists living and working on Mars. And we&#8217;ll be able to watch their experience as part of the reality TV show <em>Mars One</em>.</p>
<p>The company is in talks with <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>, a private space mission company owned by technology billionaire Elon Musk. According to Lansdorp, the crew heading to Mars will use the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket with Dragon crew capsule to get to the red planet. But hey will have trained for years before even setting foot in the rocket. </p>
<p>The entire mission relies on commercially-available parts and components using existing and proven technology. After announcing the project Lansdorp and company contacted companies to supply the mission. They say the response has been incredible. The Mars One website says, &#8220;All potential suppliers were enthused by an apolitical, commercial, manned mission to Mars and confirmed their ability to produce the parts when needed.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the mission plan and potential suppliers line up, Mars One turned its attention to training the astronauts for the grueling adventure.</p>
<p>In 2013 the company will build an exact replica of the proposed Mars colony in a remote desert here on Earth. There the 40 astronaut candidates will train and test equipment. The website says, &#8220;The astronaut selection and the preparations in the simulated Mars base will be broadcast on television and online for the public to view.&#8221;</p>
<p>Starting in 2014 the production of the first Mars communication satellite will begin. Signals take about 20 minutes to travel from Mars to Earth and back again. So a specialized satellite which is due to launch in 2016 will carry the continuous television signal, which makes this project so unique.</p>
<p>While the astronauts are deep in their training &#8212; spending about two months every year in total isolation from the rest of the world &#8212; the main supply mission to Mars will launch in early 2016, carrying all the pieces to build a Martian habitat. A rover will select the best spot for the new settlement in 2018 and by 2021 construction on the new human outpost should be complete and awaiting the first four astronauts. <div id="attachment_7171" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 237px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Marsone2.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Marsone2.jpg" alt="Proposed Crew Vehicle Lands on Mars" title="Marsone2" width="227" height="359" class="size-full wp-image-7171" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Proposed Crew Vehicle Lands on Mars</p></div></p>
<p>Once on Mars and settled into their new home, the new inhabitants will begin researching Mars&#8217; history and they will investigate any possible past life it hosted, as well as looking into present matters of interest, like how do Earth plants behave on Mars.</p>
<p>Lansdorp says that the astronauts will have two main tasks when they arrive on Mars. The first is construction and repairs. They will finish building the settlement that robots controlled from Earth will begin. Then they will work to improve it and extend the colony. Their second priority will be scientific research. Here they will be tasked with finding out all they can about Mars and about living on Mars.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Our astronauts will have to be the best people available for the job, both from the point of view of their skills and their personality. There are only four people there the first two years, so they need to be able to solve any conceivable problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>If something goes wrong on Mars they can&#8217;t just call a plumber or an electrician. Of the four, each will have a specialty but all of the colonists will pitch in to make life work so far away from what&#8217;s familiar. All four of the initial astronauts will be trained as medics &#8211; but probably not as full medical doctors, says Lansdorp, because the medical equipment will be limited. He says it will be like living in a remote mountain village or on Antarctica. He says, &#8220;The crew will first of all have to be able to fix any mechanical or electrical problem that could occur. Also, they will need to do biology and geology to do some interesting research. Discovering Mars is of course one of the main goals.&#8221;</p>
<p>He and his team would like the Mars settlement to slowly turn into a real society, a village on Mars. He says, &#8220;We would very much recommend the first settlers not to have children on Mars.&#8221; Medical facilities especially in the first years will be very rudimentary. He says, &#8220;Also, we don&#8217;t know if it is at all possible to get pregnant on Mars and how the baby would develop in lower gravity. This should be very well researched first.&#8221;</p>
<p>But many people are already dismissing the Mars One mission as &#8220;incredibly ambitious,&#8221; &#8220;expensive,&#8221; and &#8220;highly unrealistic.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ue62o/dutch_company_plans_colony_on_mars_the_one_way/c4uqfxl">One critic</a> says, &#8220;You can&#8217;t just throw Snooki and Britney Spears into a space ship for laughs, because they&#8217;ll very likely have a psychological breakdown.&#8221;</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ue62o/dutch_company_plans_colony_on_mars_the_one_way/c4uqhnn">anonymous aerospace engineer</a> says, &#8220;This is a very nice idea&#8230; but its horribly unrealistic. Going to Mars, even one way, is easily one of the most expensive things our species could decide to do, and the simple truth is that branding it as a media event is not enough to get us there. I really wish I was wrong, but as someone who works in the Aerospace industry, I can assure you that no one is going to want to watch us do our jobs for the sake of entertainment.&#8221; <div id="attachment_7167" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PackingforMarsCover-e1338933137939.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PackingforMarsCover-e1338933137939.jpg" alt="Packing for Mars by Mary Roach" title="PackingforMarsCover" width="275" height="415" class="size-full wp-image-7167" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Packing for Mars by Mary Roach</p></div></p>
<p>But for Mary Roach, a manned Mars mission struck is the ultimate reality television event. And the author who wrote <em>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</em>, <em>Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife</em> and <em>Packing for Mars: The Curious Science of Life in the Void</em> sees it as an &#8220;unbeatable funding opportunity.&#8221; The best-selling author recently signed on as a Mars One <a href="http://mars-one.com/about-mars-one/ambassadors">ambassador </a>to help champion the project.</p>
<p>Roach says the mission to Mars provides all the drama, duress, and psychological tension that makes reality TV so popular. She says, &#8220;At their core the Mars One team are aerospace professionals with the background and contacts to pull together the technical aspects of the mission. It&#8217;s <em>Jersey Shore</em> meets NASA meets <em>American Idol</em>. This might just work!&#8221;</p>
<h3>Mars over the Moon</h3>
<p>The Mars One team chose the red planet over Venus or other planets (or even the moon) for the destination of their reality TV project for a few reasons. After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system. Its soil contains water and it isn&#8217;t too cold or too hot. There is enough sunlight to charge solar panels and its gravity is 40 percent that of Earth, making it the healthiest place for the human body to cope off of Earth. </p>
<p>Lansdorp says Mars has a number of technical advantages and a number of technical disadvantages compared to the Moon. On the plus side he says, &#8220;Water is available, atmosphere with a bit of nitrogen in it. CO2 is available. But on the downside he says, &#8220;It takes more energy to get there, but it also takes longer to &#8216;fly&#8217; there, so more consumables to bring for the trip.&#8221;</p>
<p>The most important reason that Lansdorp says he is doing a Mars mission is that Mars is more cool. He says, &#8220;Mars has an appeal to people, and we need appeal because we&#8217;re planning the biggest media event ever. Mars has more drama: the people are millions of kilometers away from home. The Earth is just a star in the sky. The Mars crew is on their own.&#8221;</p>
<p>People haven&#8217;t tuned in to watch a space mission since the last moon walk in 1972. Lansdorp and his team believe more people will watch a media event around a Mars mission. Lansdorp says, &#8220;The goal of Mars One is to settle humans on Mars. Mars is more appealing to people than the Moon, which is why the media event will result in more attention than in [the] case of a Moon mission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. t&#8217; Hooft is convinced that the Mars One program is the way to go. He says, &#8220;Mars One is an extraordinarily daring initiative by people with vision and imagination. This project seems to me to be the only way to fulfill dreams of mankind’s expansion into space.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7169" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ElonMuskDragon.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ElonMuskDragon-e1338933921588.jpg" alt="SpaceX CEO Elon Musk Stands in Front of His Recently Returned Dragon Capsule" title="171698.FI.0419.spacex-launch.1.BRV" width="275" height="366" class="size-full wp-image-7169" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SpaceX CEO Elon Musk Stands in Front of His Recently Returned Dragon Capsule</p></div>And Mars is the dream retirement destination for SpaceX&#8217;s Musk. a couple of years ago he told the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/aug/01/elon-musk-spacex-rocket-mars"><em>Guardian</em></a> newspaper, &#8220;It would be a good place to retire.&#8221; Part of Musk&#8217;s mission is to turn humanity into a space-faring people who colonize other planets, including and especially Mars.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;When I was in college there were three areas that I thought most would affect the future of humanity. Those were the internet, the transition to a sustainable energy economy, and space exploration and ultimately extending life beyond Earth and making it multi-planetary.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Musk met his first goal by selling his technology company PayPal to Ebay for $1.5 billion. Then he started Tesla Motors, an electric car company and now he is making commercial space travel more affordable and more popular.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;One of the long-term goals of SpaceX is, ultimately, to get the price of transporting people and product to Mars to be low enough and with a high enough reliability that if somebody wanted to sell all their belongings and move to a new planet and forge a new civilization they could do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which is exactly what Mars One is planning. Musk estimates that this will take 20 years (though he says his Falcon rockets are ready to go to Mars now) and Mars One is trying to accomplish this feat in just over ten years.</p>
<h3>Exorbitantly Expensive</h3>
<p>Mars One estimates the cost of putting the first four people on Mars at about six billion US dollars. And it naturally assumes both the manned launch and landing on Mars will be watched by the whole world. So the company plans to raise money by taking on investors and sponsors who want their brands associated with the first colony on Mars.</p>
<p>Mars One says the six billion figure is the cost of all the hardware combined, plus the operational expenditures, plus margins. The team divided the mission into large components and talked to supply companies to figure out the overall cost. Some of the pieces, like the SpaceX Heavy Launcher can be calculated exactly but others like the Mars rover are a little trickier to price. <div id="attachment_7166" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MarsOne-e1338933212465.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/MarsOne-e1338933212465.jpg" alt="Image of Proposed Mars One Colony on Mars" title="MarsOne" width="325" height="188" class="size-full wp-image-7166" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Image of Proposed Mars One Colony on Mars</p></div></p>
<p>The company is now looking for a round of funding to pay potential suppliers to perform conceptual design studies, which will result in more accurate calculations of the cost of each component. With the results of these studies, Mars One will have a much better indication of the mission&#8217;s price and will have a far rounder, more detailed case to present for a new round of sponsorship or investment.</p>
<p>Making the mission to Mars into the largest media event in history may be easier than convincing potential sponsors that their plan is really feasible. Mars One is in the process of amassing relatively small sponsorships now to pay suppliers to take the hardware a step further. They believe that this will increase the plan&#8217;s credibility and in turn attract even more sponsors.</p>

<p>Mars One is one of a handful of projects exploring sending people to Mars. <a href="http://marshome.org/">Mars Foundation</a> and <a href="http://www.marssociety.org/">Mars Society</a> are working on missions to Mars. But this is the only one that is built by a commercial company with a planned reality TV program attached.</p>
<p>Lansdorp adds, &#8220;There is a big difference between the Apollo mission, the ISS and our mission. Our mission will be one of exploration. It will truly be the next giant leap for mankind. And who gets to go to Mars will be selected, at least in part, by the audience such that they will be interesting people to watch. We are expecting to use the Falcon Heavy as our launcher. It is powerful enough to launch our cargo straight to Mars, and the manned transit habitat in four pieces, assembled in low-Earth orbit. We have discussed our financial planning with our suppliers. Obviously it will be a challenge to secure the funding in line with our timeline, but as you can tell from replies from many other people, a lot of people believe in the media spectacle business case. We are building a strong technical case that will convince our sponsors and investors that this can really happen. If we can achieve that, believing the business case, we think we can convince them to join us!&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time ever scientists were able to use the nuclear disaster in Japan to track the migration of fish. After finding bluefin tuna with high levels of two cesium radioisotopes, marine biologists were able to determine the migration route for the species between Japan and California.</p>
<p>Scientists say they are surprised to see that blue fin tuna that were swimming near Japan last year during the nation&#8217;s nuclear crisis following a massive earthquake and tsunami still show signs of radioactivity after migrating all the way to the coast of California some 6,000 miles away.</p>
<p>After taking routine samples of the popular food fish off the coast of California, marine biologists found that all the fish tested contain levels of two radioactive isotopes &#8212; Cesium-134 and Cesium-137. <div id="attachment_7153" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BluefinTuna.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/BluefinTuna-e1338835110245.jpg" alt="Bluefin Tuna Make 6,000-Mile Migratory Trek Carrying Japanese Radiation" title="BluefinTuna" width="325" height="246" class="size-full wp-image-7153" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bluefin Tuna Make 6,000-Mile Migratory Trek Carrying Japanese Radiation</p></div></p>
<p><a href="http://www.somas.stonybrook.edu/people/fisher.html">Nicholas Fisher</a> from Stony Brook University in New York was shocked that every blue fin tuna his team analyzed still had measurable levels of radioactivity. Results from the study are published in the May 29 issue of <em><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/05/22/1204859109.full.pdf+html?sid=cc8ae292-2761-4ed9-b0f3-e8f82de97bcb">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the U.S.</a></em> </p>
<p>Stanford University marine biology PhD candidate <a href="http://micheli.stanford.edu/DanielMadigan.html">Daniel Madigan</a> is studying migration of large predators like sharks and bluefin tuna. While he was surprised that the tuna the team tested had elevated Cesium levels, he is more surprised that no one else is studying other marine animals that were likely affected by high radiation levels following the Fukushima Dai-Chi nuclear crisis.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;We were surprised to find this radioactivity in all bluefin tested, but we were also surprised that, to our knowledge, no other animals far from Japan have been tested.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the bluefin found near San Diego last August contain some extra radiation, the amounts are still within the safe range for human consumption. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/seafoodwatch.aspx?c=dd">Seafood Watch</a> scientist Tom Pickerell says that given the scale of the incident in Japan he isn&#8217;t surprised that fish picked up radioactivity and have absorbed it into their muscle tissue.</p>
<p>Scientists will monitor radioactivity levels in tuna and other food fish for years to come. Madigan says the discovery proves unequivocally the timing and migration routes of bluefin tuna. </p>

<p>Though the Dragon space capsule returned safely in a splash down 400 miles off the coast of California the mission was deemed a success just after launch on May 22. And each milestone it reached along the 9-day journey was met as another victory for the first private space cargo supply capsule.</p>
<p>Even before unberthing from the International Space Station, Dragon mission director John Couluris says, &#8220;It was a major success for us.&#8221; After spending five days attached to the orbiting space lab Dragon disconnected and began its return trip. After a ten-minute engine burn the capsule began its fiery reentry into Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>After the red and white parachutes were spotted from planes circling the landing zone, a triumphant SpaceX CEO tweeted, &#8220;Splashdown successfull!!&#8221; Those words from and elated Elon Musk.</p>
<p>Unlike other vehicles Dragon is built to withstand a super-heated reentry, capable of withstanding temperatures above 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. And on its first return trip, the capsule is carrying old equipment, science experiments and other payload that will be sent to NASA once it is recovered and returned to SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, CA, outside of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>This successful test flight proves that the era of commercial space flight has arrived. The entire mission unfolded without a hitch.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7144" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DragonCapsuleSplashdown-e1338489714999.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DragonCapsuleSplashdown-e1338489714999.jpg" alt="Dragon Capsule Floats in Pacific, Waiting Recovery Ships, photo by Mike Altenhofen/SpaceX" title="DragonCapsuleSplashdown" width="325" height="214" class="size-full wp-image-7144" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dragon Capsule Floats in Pacific, Waiting Recovery Ships, photo by Mike Altenhofen/SpaceX</p></div>For now, Dragon is the only capsule capable of delivering and returning cargo from the International Space Station. But several other private companies are hoping to secure contracts with NASA for future trips to the low-orbit space outpost. Besides SpaceX, three companies &#8212; Sierra Nevada Corp., Boeing, and Blue Origin &#8212; are working on capsules to take astronauts to and from the space station.</p>

<p>Billionaire tech mogul <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a> oversaw the launch of his latest enterprise from his own mission control in California while in Florida his t-shirt and shorts clad team took over the control center at Cape Canaveral. When the Dragon rocket ignited and lifted off effortlessly into the Florida predawn sky, a new era of space exploration officially began.</p>
<p>Musk&#8217;s company <a href="http://www.spacex.com">SpaceX </a>has spent over $1 billion and ten year working to become NASA&#8217;s taxi, ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Today&#8217;s launch was the audition for that job, which won&#8217;t begin for another three years. But successful liftoff with payload &#8212; mostly food and supplies &#8212; proves that a commercial entity can augment a government space program.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7137" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 372px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DragonLaunchT+05.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DragonLaunchT+05.jpg" alt="SpaceX Launches New Era with Successful Liftoff of Falcon 9 Rocket and Dragon Launch Vehicle, May 22, 2012" title="DragonLaunchT+05" width="362" height="593" class="size-full wp-image-7137" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">SpaceX Launches New Era with Successful Liftoff of Falcon 9 Rocket and Dragon Launch Vehicle, May 22, 2012</p></div>On Twitter proud papa Musk says, &#8220;Feels like a giant weight just came off my back.&#8221; Later he tells reporters, &#8220;For us, it&#8217;s like winning the Super Bowl.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this test flight had a lot riding on it. After several scrubbed attempts late last year and a last second abort last Saturday, a successful launch means that the commercial space age is finally here. Even Musk&#8217;s competitors are pleased by the first-stage success.</p>
<p>Mark Sirangelo, the chairman of <a href="http://www.sncorp.com/snc_ss.php">Sierra Nevada Corp. Space Systems</a> says, &#8220;The shuttle may be retired, but the American dream of space exploration is alive and well.&#8221;</p>
<p>NASA Administrator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_F._Bolden,_Jr.">Charles Bolden</a> seemed to proudly hand over the keys of low-Earth orbit space travel to private companies. He says, &#8220;The significance of this day cannot be overstated.&#8221; He says it&#8217;s a great day for America and for the world because there were those out there who thought that once the 30-year-old space shuttle program was retired last year that the U.S. was no longer in the space business.</p>
<p>And until today space was purely the domain of governments so that assumption was not so off base. But in the last ten years dozens of space companies have been designing crew vehicles, rockets, elevators and space planes. Several companies, including SpaceX secured lucrative contracts from NASA to do some of the heavy lifting that the shuttles used to do.</p>
<p>Because today&#8217;s launch was considered a test flight, the Falcon 9 rocket with unmanned Dragon crew vehicle attached to the tip is only carrying non-essential items just in case something went wrong. Just before 4:00 a.m. EDT the rocket launched without a hitch and began its three day journey to meet up with the ISS.</p>
<p>Only five different vehicles have rendezvoused with the orbiting space station and so far they have all been governments. On Saturday, if all continues to go well, the Dragon  will become the first commercial launch vehicle to dock at a space outpost.</p>
<p>President Obama&#8217;s science adviser John Holdren says of the occasion, &#8220;This expanded role for the private sector will free up more of NASA&#8217;s resources to do what NASA does best &#8212; tackle the most demanding technological challenges in space, including those of human spaceflight beyond low-Earth orbit.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the rocket raced into the night sky, the controllers on the ground celebrated. They cheered when the Dragon reached orbit, nine minutes into its flight. And they embraced once the solar panels opened as planned. The next milestone moment in this flight will occur on Thursday when the Dragon gets close to the space station. From over a mile away it will practice docking maneuvers. And if all goes well the actual docking will take place on Friday.</p>
<p>The six-crew team aboard the ISS will be happy to receive 1,000 pounds of groceries and other goodies from home. The Dragon is also carrying a special payload &#8212; the ashes of 300 people (including the actor who played Scotty in the Star Trek TV series.) The company <a href="http://www.celestis.com/">Celestis </a>sends the cremated remains of loved ones to orbit eternally aboard key rocket launches. </p>
<p>After a week attached to the station the capsule will begin its return trip in about a week. It won&#8217;t return empty though. It is scheduled to return science experiments and equipment. Unlike other vehicles that burn up on the way back through the atmosphere, the Dragon will splash down in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens in the next week, two more Dragon launches are planned this year. And the private space race has begun.</p>
<p>Musk says, &#8220;This mission heralds the dawn of a new era of space exploration, one in which there is a significant commercial space element. It is like the advent of the Internet in the mid-1990s when commercial companies entered what was originally a government endeavor. That move dramatically accelerated the pace of advancement and made the Internet accessible to the mass market. I think we’re at a similar inflection point for space. I hope and I believe that this mission will be historic in marking that turning point towards a rapid advancement in space transportation technology.&#8221;</p>

<p>24-year old <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/aimee-copeland">Aimee Copeland</a> was the picture of health. She was working towards a Masters degree in psychology at the University of West Georgia before she went zip-lining three weeks ago. During a weekend trip the adventurous student fell off a zip-line when it broke, cut herself and landed in a rocky river where a common bacteria got into the wound and began eating away at her soft tissue. Doctors think that a particularly virulent form of a waterborne bacteria caused Copeland&#8217;s infection.</p>
<p>Called <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002415/">necrotizing fasciitis</a>, this life-threatening condition can be started by any number of common bacteria. In this case Copeland was exposed to a very aggressive form of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeromonas_hydrophila">Aeromonas hydrophila</a></em>. The problem arises when that bacteria gets into a deep wound like the one Copeland sustained on her thigh requiring 22 stitches on May 1 after a homemade zip-line broke. <div id="attachment_7110" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 202px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AimeeCopeland.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/AimeeCopeland-e1337711245292.jpg" alt="Aimee Copeland, 24-Year-Old Georgia Graduate Student " title="AimeeCopeland" width="192" height="250" class="size-full wp-image-7110" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aimee Copeland, 24-Year-Old Georgia Graduate Student </p></div></p>
<p>After a number of surgeries Copeland had to have both hands and feet amputated as well as part of her abdomen so doctors could get ahead of the infection, which can be treated with antibiotics if caught early enough. But in Copeland&#8217;s case the infection was very deep, causing her a lot of pain, but didn&#8217;t appear unusual by looking at the stitched wound.</p>
<p>It took doctors four days to determine the infection and by that time the flesh eating was already underway. To prevent the infection from jumping from the soft tissue to the blood stream where it would cause sepsis doctors have to amputate the dead tissue.</p>
<p>One in five cases of flesh-eating bacterial infections result in death. Copeland is bucking the odds after doctors gave her a grim prognosis two weeks ago. She is off the ventilator and breathing on her own but she isn&#8217;t out of the woods yet.</p>
<p>A new mom and a landscaper also have contracted flesh-eating bacterial infections in Georgia this month. While the infections are very rare &#8212; occurring in only about 750 people each year &#8212; warm ponds and rivers are play host to the very bacteria that can destroy the soft tissue. It&#8217;s really the person&#8217;s immune system that determines how severe the infection will be.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7111" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 218px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LanaKuykendall.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LanaKuykendall-e1337711410655.jpg" alt="Lana Kukendall, 36-Year-Old South Carolina New Mom and Paramedic" title="LanaKuykendall" width="208" height="250" class="size-full wp-image-7111" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lana Kukendall, 36-Year-Old South Carolina New Mom and Paramedic</p></div>In the case of 36-year-old <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/21/lana-kuykendall-flesh-eating-bacteria-necrotizing-fasciitis_n_1531665.html">Lana Kuykendall</a> her immune system was naturally compromised because she was in the third trimester of her pregnancy with her twins. Shortly after delivering them in Atlanta, she returned to Greenville, South Carolina where the new mom who is also a paramedic went to the hospital after becoming worried about a bruise that appeared to be growing on the back of her leg. By the time she got to the emergency room it had grown to the size of a sheet of paper. And by the time they wheeled her into the operating room it had eaten a significant chunk of her legs.</p>
<p>Kuykendall had had seven surgeries to remove the bacteria-ravaged tissue. Doctors think that she contracted streptococcus, the same bacteria that causes sore throats and acne. But she and Copeland aren&#8217;t alone. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/21/bobby-vaughn-flesh-eating-bacteria-necrotizing-fasciitis_n_1533806.html">Bobby Vaughn</a>, a 32 year old landscaper in Cartersville, Georgia had a similar flesh-eating infection that went from the size of a peanut to a grapefruit in no time, he told a local TV station.</p>
<p>South Carolina state epidemiologist <a href="http://www.sph.sc.edu/epid_bios/facultystaffdetails.php?ID=339">Jerry Gibson</a> says that Group A streptococcus lives on people&#8217;s skin or in their nose but generally remains harmless. He says infection can be triggered by &#8220;something subtle, sometimes in a person who has poor nutrition or alcohol use, but also in people who have no immune deficiencies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Microbiologist <a href="http://medschool.umaryland.edu/facultyresearchprofile/viewprofile.aspx?id=2155">Amy Horneman</a>, the director of microbiology and molecular diagnostics at the Maryland Veteran&#8217;s Affairs isn&#8217;t involved in any of the current flesh-eating bacteria cases but she says the bacteria themselves are very common. <div id="attachment_7115" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 283px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Aeromonas_hydrophila.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Aeromonas_hydrophila.jpg" alt="Aeromonas hydrophilia, Rod-Shaped Bacteria under a Microscope" title="Aeromonas_hydrophila" width="273" height="220" class="size-full wp-image-7115" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Aeromonas hydrophilia, Rod-Shaped Bacteria under a Microscope</p></div></p>
<p>She says the water-loving variety of the microorganism Aeromonas is found in freshwater sources such as lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, as well as brackish water like the Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound. They can also be found in drinking and surface waters, especially recreational sources. Of the 33 strains of the bacteria only eight are known to cause problems in people. Those problems include diarrhea, wound infections, respiratory, ocular, and bloodstream infections. Dr. Horneman says some other serious but less common infections caused by this organism include necrotizing fasciitis and kidney failure.</p>
<p>The bacteria is more common during the warmer months from April to October and infections generally coincide with recreational water activities like swimming, fishing or boating. People can become sick by either ingesting the bacteria or by exposing an open cut to the bacteria in the water.</p>
<p>Dr. Horneman says that people with compromised immune systems are more at risk but that healthy people like Copeland are also subject to infection.</p>
<p>A Georgia TV station wanted to know what was in the water after Copeland&#8217;s story became public. A reporter took samples from the Little Tallapoosa River, where Copeland landed after the zip-line broke. She took the water to Emory University to have it analyzed and found that there were about 140 A. hydrophilia bacteria cells per tablespoon of water. Those findings aren&#8217;t terribly surprising and nothing to be overtly worried about.</p>
<p>Scientists at Emory&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sph.emory.edu/CGSW/">Center for Global Safe Water</a> say the concentration of bacteria in untreated water &#8212; like lakes and rivers &#8212; can change on a daily basis. Certainly 140 cells per mL is measurable but nowhere near the high of harmful bacteria 10,000 cells per mL that those researchers have reported in the past.</p>
<p>Dr. Amy Kirby tested the river water samples and says, &#8220;Aeromonas and streptococcus are very ubiquitous bacteria so you are going to be exposed to it every day.&#8221; But she says, &#8220;It&#8217;s just a matter of getting more dangerous exposures.&#8221; <div id="attachment_7113" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 267px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BobbyVaughn.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BobbyVaughn-e1337711567359.jpg" alt="Bobby Vaughn, 32-Year-Old Georgia Landscaper" title="BobbyVaughn" width="257" height="250" class="size-full wp-image-7113" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bobby Vaughn, 32-Year-Old Georgia Landscaper</p></div></p>
<p>Vaughn fell out of a tree and cut his side, leading to one of those more dangerous exposures. He began feeling sick right away. He tells <a href="http://www.cbsatlanta.com/story/18558629/catersville-man-fighting-off-flesh-eating-bacteria">CBS News</a>, &#8220;I just out of the blue wasn&#8217;t feeling real well, and I went over and sat in my truck for a minute, and I was feeling real hot, and I started vomiting, you know, so we just stopped for the day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tells the <a href="http://www2.nbc26.tv/news/2012/may/21/georgia-man-suffering-flesh-eating-bacteria-being--ar-3830509/">NBC affiliate in Atlanta</a> learning about what both Kuyrkendal and Copeland are facing makes what he&#8217;s going through pale in comparison. He says, &#8220;They are alive. I am alive. That is what I am grateful for. That is all I can ask for.&#8221; </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor’s Note: It&#8217;s Science Ditty Friday. Every Friday REALscience compiles a song (generally with an accompanying video) to kick your weekend off with a musical start. Have a favorite science song? Send it to <strong><a href="mailto:ditty@realscience.us">ditty@realscience.us</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qBXZ-Vw4Hmg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The news about Amimee Copeland is spreading like her flesh-eating bacteria. The sunny 24-year-old contracted a rare form of a common bacteria after being injured on a zip-line at the beginning of the month. She has undergone several surgeries to have dead tissue removed, including amputation of her hands and feet.</p>
<p>The brave psychology grad student from Georgia appears to remain optimistic through her trials and tribulations. Her father says that she hasn&#8217;t shed a tear over the loss of her limbs and that she was bored in the hospital and requested a book. Doctors think those are good signs after giving the young woman low odds of even surviving the flesh-eating bacterial infection from exposure to <em>Aeromonas hydrophilia</em>.</p>
<p>This water-loving superbug is very common in untreated water supplies, including warm lakes and rivers, like the one Copeland landed in when a homemade zip-line broke. The gash she sustained on her leg required 22 stitches but was deep and bacteria made it&#8217;s way in and was sealed up by doctors where it was able to start eating tissue from the inside out.</p>
<p>When a bacteria gets into an open wound like Copeland&#8217;s it kills the healthy tissue, turning it black. The only way to treat the infection is to get ahead of it and remove the dead and dying flesh. The infection is incredibly painful and requires multiple surgeries until the doctors are convinced they have removed it all.</p>
<p>Every year about 800 people contract some form of flesh-eating bacteria, also known as necrotizing faciitis. One in five die from the infection. Most people who develop life-threatening cases have already compromised immune systems that prevent the body from fighting off the pathogen.</p>
<p>Copeland appeared to be the picture of health before she was injured and exposed to the waterborne bacteria. Some news reports say she was recently diagnosed with lupus. But her family denies that claim, saying that she was being tested for food allergies.</p>
<p>Students and faculty of the psychology department at the University of West Georgia have turned the website into an electronic newsletter, chronicling Copeland&#8217;s journey as she fights for her life.</p>
<p>Connecticut singer-songwriter <a href="http://coreydurkin.com/aimee-copeland">Corey Durkin</a> was so moved by Copeland&#8217;s story that he wrote a song for her.</p>
<blockquote><h3>Southern Belle</h3>
<p>By: Corey Durkin</p>
<p>I hope you know I hope you hear<br />
He&#8217;s got big plans for you<br />
I know you&#8217;re tired but we&#8217;re all here<br />
We&#8217;re gonna stand right by you</p>
<p>When your heart gets heavy and you wanna breathe<br />
And your eyes stop searching for the better season our love won&#8217;t go away<br />
No our love won&#8217;t go away<br />
When your hips start moving to a country song<br />
And your lips turn up as the morning comes our love</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just a southern belle<br />
Who fell down a wishing well<br />
And you&#8217;ve got time to give<br />
You&#8217;re more than a silhouette<br />
Asleep in a hospital bed<br />
And i don&#8217;t know anything about you<br />
But i want to</p>
<p>When you wake when you smile<br />
Now the whole world sees you<br />
Make your love take your time<br />
And your faith will guide you</p>
<p>When your heart gets heavy and you wanna breathe<br />
And your eyes stop searching for the better seasons our love won&#8217;t go away<br />
No our love won&#8217;t go away<br />
When your hips start moving to a country song<br />
And your lips turn up as the morning comes our love</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just a southern belle<br />
Who fell down a wishing well<br />
And you&#8217;ve got time to give<br />
You&#8217;re more than a silhouette<br />
Asleep in a hospital bed<br />
And i don&#8217;t know anything about you<br />
But i want to</p>
<p>Ride in the daylight with those heavy winds by your side<br />
I wanna see you as you are what you are is beautiful<br />
To watch you dance feeling so high with all your love and grace</p>
<p>Soon you&#8217;ll be back where you belong</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just a southern belle<br />
Who fell down a wishing well<br />
And you&#8217;ve got time to give<br />
You&#8217;re more than a silhouette<br />
Asleep in a hospital bed<br />
And i don&#8217;t know anything about you<br />
But i want to</p>

<p>Matt Rutherford is not your typical 31 year old. The Annapolis, Maryland resident just returned from a 309-day sailing trip. The avid sailor becomes the first person to circumnavigate North and South America by himself. <div id="attachment_7092" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 219px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherford.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherford.jpg" alt="Matt Rutherford, First Man to Circumnavigate the Americas by Himself" title="MattRutherford" width="209" height="273" class="size-full wp-image-7092" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt Rutherford, First Man to Circumnavigate the Americas by Himself</p></div></p>
<p>After traveling over 27,000 miles the young philanthropist returned to shore in Chesapeake Bay in late April, after completely a trip that wasn&#8217;t even possible a few years ago. </p>
<p>Before setting out to accomplish this nautical feat, Rutherford didn&#8217;t plan much beyond sailing from east to west through the Northwest Passage, the no-longer-fabled sea route through the Canadian archipelago in the Arctic. After the ice began receding annually in August, Rutherford decided he wanted to be among the first to sail the passage.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7089" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherford2.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherford2-e1337386555521.jpg" alt="Rutherford Pilots the 27-Foot Albin Vega Sailboat, St. Brendan near Annapolis, Maryland after 309-Day Voyage" title="MattRutherford2" width="325" height="216" class="size-full wp-image-7089" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Rutherford Pilots the 27-Foot Albin Vega Sailboat, St. Brendan near Annapolis, Maryland after 309-Day Voyage</p></div>And if he and his 27-foot sloop made it through the treacherous waterway then he would continue the journey, setting his sights on the hair-raising milestone of Cape Horn at the southern tip of South America. Eventually, he hit all his goals and successfully sailed around both continents.</p>
<p>But first he had to sail through the Arctic.</p>
<p>Before leaving Annapolis last June Rutherford was focused on the Northwest Passage. Then, he said, &#8220;The ice won’t melt enough to make the attempt until August.&#8221; </p>
<p>And it did. He describes the journey across the far north as hairy, getting locked into long foggy stretches of flat water with floating iceberg obstacles.</p>
<p>But the Northwest Passage afforded him his favorite moment &#8212; spotting narwhals &#8212; which now inspires him to return there to film a documentary (his next project.)</p>
<p>He did almost get run over by a freighter in the home stretch. His engine died 7,000 miles from home. And he had a few scary days in the Arctic. </p>
<p>Rutherford&#8217;s Albin-Vega sailboat doesn&#8217;t have radar so sailing at night or in fog can be dangerous. When he reached Baffin Bay in the southern Arctic last July the fog rolled in for a few sleepless days. Then, he said, &#8220;I never have been a fan of the fog but when you are sailing blindly, surrounded by icebergs with no radar, things get a bit dodgy.&#8221; <div id="attachment_7091" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherfordIcebergNWPassage.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherfordIcebergNWPassage-e1337386638243.jpg" alt="Iceberg Cathedral at 75.22.410n, the Northern Point of the Solo the Americas Voyage, photo by Matt Rutherford" title="MattRutherfordIcebergNWPassage" width="325" height="193" class="size-full wp-image-7091" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Iceberg Cathedral at 75.22.410n, the Northern Point of the Solo the Americas Voyage, photo by Matt Rutherford</p></div></p>
<p>He says the fog dissipated and he found himself surrounded by five large icebergs within a mile of his position. The sun came out but the wind died so he crawled through parts of the passage where temperatures were a balmy 60 degrees last summer. This is an area that used to be ice-locked year round. But since 2007 the Northwest Passage has opened for several weeks during the late summer, allowing dozens of vessels to cross the top of North America.</p>
<p>Rutherford says that the area is still not ice-free but it is ice-less, meaning that boats can sail around icebergs of all sizes and shapes. He says, &#8220;I can deal with ice bergs but pack ice is something very different. Speaking of ice bergs I’ve seen more then I can count. From giant growlers the size of a large office building to bergy bits the size of a VW bug.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thinks it&#8217;s worth sailing to the Northwest Passage just to see the icebergs. He says, &#8220;The bergs are natures sculptures, each one unique and as they melt and break apart their beauty changes and evolves. Some are bleach white but most have a tint of blue or sometimes pink.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7097" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherford3.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherford3-e1337388348230.jpg" alt="Matt Rutherford Sailing the Northwest Passage, photo by Matt Rutherford" title="MattRutherford3" width="325" height="244" class="size-full wp-image-7097" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt Rutherford Sailing the Northwest Passage, photo by Matt Rutherford</p></div>While hugging the northwest coast of Greenland he didn&#8217;t sleep for three days and lamented not having a crew to watch for icebergs. He says, &#8220;I didn’t sleep for 3 days and only got a couple hours sleep last night broken up in 20 minute intervals. Because the sun never sets up here my concept of time has been destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that makes sailing through bergy water a little easier, providing the fog doesn&#8217;t shut down visibility.</p>
<p>Rutherford says, &#8220;Icebergs are amazingly beautifully, but man is it hard to sleep when they’re around. Hitting a berg would be like running into a giant rock. The ice has no forgiveness and would sink my little boat in record time.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the time he entered the Northwest Passage proper temperatures dropped to the 30s and the ice was still choking the narrow passage. He arrived on Day 50 of his journey, tired, wet and rattled.</p>
<p>After fighting a diesel leak he almost hit a mammoth iceberg, sailed for a straight 50 hours without sleep all while trying to discern whitecaps kicked up by 30-knot winds from low-lying iceberg tips.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;With all the drama aside – Baffin Bay is one of my favorite places I’ve ever sailed. It’s up there with the Gambia river, Galicia, and the Exumas. Between the icebergs of unexplainable beauty and 24 hours of daylight it’s as unique as any body of water can be. I’m happy to trade sleep for a chance to sail such incredible waters, but it’s also the most dangerous place I’ve ever sailed. It’s a place I love, fear and respect.&#8221;</p>
<p>From 2008 to 2010 Rutherford sailed the North Atlantic across to Europe, through Northern Europe, down the coast of Africa, and ultimately 200 miles up the Gambia River before returning via the Trade Wind route to the Caribbean.</p>
<p>With his previous sailing adventures firmly in mind, Rutherford continued his journey west, toward Alaska.</p>
<p>He fought sleep depravation, fog and the constant concern of crashing into an iceberg by singing to himself for hours. He says, &#8220;I usally start off with some Wu-Tang but its not long until I’m singing Christmas carols. That probably sounds strange considering its the middle of the summer, but you couldn’t tell me that – I’m surrounded by ice. Plus, Santa only lives two blocks down the road.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7093" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 257px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherfordCrokerBayIceberg.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherfordCrokerBayIceberg.png" alt="Icebergs in Croker Bay, photo by Matt Rutherford" title="MattRutherfordCrokerBayIceberg" width="247" height="186" class="size-full wp-image-7093" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Icebergs in Croker Bay, photo by Matt Rutherford</p></div>In Croker Bay Rutherford caught up on repairs and sleep, floating in a quiet bay amid a curious flotilla of icebergs, ranging from the size of a shopping cart to a house, with many about the size of a semi-truck. He fended off a few icy interlopers with his boat hook, and even caught some ice with his fishing net. He melted the fresh ice with a pot mounted on his engine and even treated himself to a Scotch on the rocks, where he says, &#8220;The rocks coming strait off a glacier and had been frozen for a millennia. Now thats a good drink!&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though the Northwest Passage is open for part of the summer every year after thousands of years of being iced in sailors have to time their passage carefully, following the shifting ice and making a run based on recommendations from Canadian officials who monitor the area. </p>
<p>By the second week of August Rutherford reached a point in the passage where the ice was about 50 percent open at the top but only 5 percent at the bottom. As the ice shifted, pushed by steady winds, he made his run through Peel Sound, hoping to reach the western entrance before the ice closed back in.</p>
<p>To make his circumnavigation a non-stop trip Rutherford&#8217;s boat, St. Brendan (named for the Irish saint who sailed across the North Atlantic in search of the Garden of Eden) couldn&#8217;t dock, anchor or tie up to anything attached to the ground. He could tie up to a floating iceberg or use his parachute sea anchor (which doesn&#8217;t attach to anything) to be considered a vessel under way, according to U.S. Coast Guard guidelines.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;The reason for the non-stop part of the trip is simple – for some time I’ve wanted to sail alone around the world non-stop in the southern latitudes. I’ve also wanted to sail the Northwest Passage. So I combined the two and this way I can sail both the Northwest Passage and Cape Horn.&#8221; <div id="attachment_7087" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherfordmap.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MattRutherfordmap-e1337387915589.jpg" alt="Matt Rutherford&#039;s Solo Navigation Route around North and South America" title="MattRutherfordmap" width="325" height="553" class="size-full wp-image-7087" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt Rutherford&#039;s Solo Navigation Route around North and South America</p></div></p>
<p>Halfway down Peel Sound, Rutherford ran into a marine party, which he describes as a stretch of water filled with seals, seabirds and narwhals (tusked whales). He says he was afraid to fish in the area for fear of hooking a seal. But says the narwhals were a trip highlight. he says, &#8220;The narwhals didn’t seem to pay any attention to my boat, they would swim right by like they had no care in the world. I must of seen at least 50 of them, it went on like this for miles. I can believe I’ve actually seen a narwhal!&#8221;</p>
<p>In mid-August Rutherford says that temperatures were still hovering around 60 degrees, which he says was great for him but terrible for the Arctic.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;I have a bad feeling that if things stay this way the Arctic is going to be decimated in the next 15 years or so and its going to effect us all.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he reached the halfway point of the Northwest Passage Rutherford ran into a series of strong storms which kept his boat wet most of the time. He noted that much of the wood on the boat was turning black from wood rot and his books and other belongings were collecting black mold.</p>
<p>By the time he reached the western side of the passage he was being regularly battered by strong wind and rain, part of which was a leftover typhoon from Asia that made sailing difficult.</p>
<p>But on September 19, a triumphant yet soggy Rutherford finished his journey across the top of North America. <a href="http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/">Scott Polar Research Institute</a> recorded his passage as the the smallest single-handed boat in history to make it through the Northwest passage.</p>
<p>Rutherford postulates that he set another record. He says, &#8220;I imagine I’ve also sailed the cheapest boat in history threw the Northwest Passage as ST Brendan is only worth around ten grand.&#8221;</p>
<p>After making the harrowing trip around the Americas a modest Rutherford tells <a href="http://www.sail-world.com/cruising/canada/Matt-Rutherford-solo-around-the-Americas:-Exclusive-interview/97114">Sail World</a>, &#8220;The ocean can be difficult but for the most part my circumnavigation of the Americas was a pleasant and enjoyable experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>But others describe Rutherford&#8217;s feat in terms of other great explorers.</p>
<p>Lee Tawney, director of the National Sailing Hall of Fame compared him to Sir Edmund Hillary and says it is like Rutherford scaled Mount Everest without Sherpas. </p>
<p>Rutherford&#8217;s friend Andy Shell says that the single-hander (solo sailor in sailing speak) belongs in the group that make up the Mount Rushmore of sailing pioneers.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7090" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 247px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CRABlogo.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CRABlogo.jpg" alt="Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating, Rutherford&#039;s Charity" title="CRABlogo" width="237" height="106" class="size-full wp-image-7090" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating, Rutherford&#039;s Charity</p></div>His journey wasn&#8217;t just one of vanity. Rutherford was raising money for <a href="http://crabsailing.org/">Chesapeake Regional Assessable Boating</a> (CRAB). The Annapolis-based charity has been helping mentally and physically disabled people learn to sail for over 20 years. He set a goal to raise $250,000 for the organization where he has volunteered. By the time he reached land on April 21, he had raised over $80,000.</p>
<p>While on a boat delivery from Chesapeake Bay to the Caribbean island of Antigua Rutherford shared his idea to start a sailing non-profit organization for disabled people with fellow sailor Tag Hunt. That&#8217;s when he first learned of CRAB. When he returned from that trip he met with CRAB founder Don Backe. After volunteering there for a few months, Rutherford joked that Backe should let him sail a 25-foot folkboat the charity had for sale through the Northwest Passage. <div id="attachment_7094" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 270px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DonBacke.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DonBacke-e1337387486305.jpg" alt="Don Backe, Co-Founder of CRAB" title="DonBacke" width="260" height="228" class="size-full wp-image-7094" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Don Backe, Co-Founder of CRAB</p></div></p>
<p>He says, &#8220;I said to Don &#8216;You should let me take that boat up to the Northwest Passage and we&#8217;ll raise some money for CRAB.&#8217;&#8221; Instead of laughing at Rutherford, Backe backed the idea and the <a href="http://www.solotheamericas.org/">Solo the Americas</a> journey was born. The website says, &#8220;Matt&#8217;s motivation for the trip is to show people, particularly those with disabilities, that there are no limits to what can be accomplished in life; and to raise money for Chesapeake Region Accessible Boating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rutherford is inspired by Backe&#8217;s unflinching optimism. After a severe car accident 25 years ago left Backe paralyzed, he co-founded CRAB. After the accident Rutherford says, &#8220;He was able to move on with his life without being depressed and saying &#8216;woe is me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>As Rutherford was making his final push for Annapolis in April, the crew of the boat Godspeed (the one Rutherford was sailing to Antigua when he first heard of CRAB) decided to match all donations (up to $21,000) made to CRAB through the end of May.</p>
<p>When it comes to sailing many agree that it&#8217;s very difficult to say who did what when because so many people have sailed so many places. Rutherford says his trip is much easier to track because of the Northwest Passage element. Few boats have sailed through the Northwest Passage and every boat that has is listed on the Scott Polar Research Institute&#8217;s website at University of Cambridge along with the number of crew. </p>
<p>Out of these boats very few were sailed through the Northwest Passage single-handed and out of those few only a couple boats did it both single-handed and non-stop. Rutherford says, &#8220;The very very few that have did not continue non-stop to Cape Horn and then back to their original starting point. So – long story short I’m the first person in history to have completed a non-stop single-handed circumnavigation of the Americas.&#8221; </p>
<p>Total mileage: 27,700<br />
Total time: 309 Days 18 Hours and 5 Minutes (only 5 hours off of his predicted 310-day estimate)</p>
<p>Next Trip: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The next trip (if I can raise the money) will be a trip back up to the artic. The idea is to have a few crew, one of which is a friend of mine who is a polar scientist. He will bring scientific instruments and we will sail to the extreme northern regions of the Northwest Passage and collect scientific data in places scientists usually don’t get to go. So it will not just be a trip to the arctic, it will be a scientific expedition. We will also shoot a documentary and raise money for a non-profit. So all in all I’m trying to sail back to the arctic on a scientific expedition and shoot a documentary that focuses on climate change and raise some money for charity. Sounds like a good idea to me.&#8221; &#8211;Matt Rutherford, May 11, 2012</p></blockquote>

<p>For several years conservationists, big-hearted celebrities and oceanographers have been talking about the <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2009/08/31/scientists-find-great-pacific-garbage-patch/">Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a> (and other garbage patches around the world.) Now scientists are showing that the Texas-sized piece of water real estate is growing bigger every year, fed by plastic pollution from developing countries like China. The diffused mass of micro-plastic gets stuck in an area between Hawaii and California called the <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2008/05/01/staying-current/">North Pacific Subtropical Gyre</a>. <div id="attachment_7048" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MicroplasticInGarbagePatch.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MicroplasticInGarbagePatch-e1337190643153.jpg" alt="Tiny Plastic Confetti Dots Open Ocean for Thousands of Miles, Making Garbage Patch Almost Invisible from Above, courtesy of Scripps" title="MicroplasticInGarbagePatch" width="325" height="216" class="size-full wp-image-7048" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Tiny Plastic Confetti Dots Open Ocean for Thousands of Miles, Making Garbage Patch Almost Invisible from Above, courtesy of Scripps</p></div></p>
<p>Think of it like a vortex where ocean currents and wind patterns converge to create a circular motion that traps anything that floats into a large but contained area.</p>
<p>New research by a graduate student at <a href="http://sio.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Oceanographic Institute</a> at the University of California San Diego shows the patch has experienced a 100-fold increase in the number &#038; mass of plastic per unit seawater in the last 40 years. The study appears in the journal <em><a href="http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/05/10/rsbl.2012.0298">Biology Letters</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.miriamgoldstein.info">Miriam Goldstein</a>, the lead author of the study says, &#8220;Plastic only became widespread in late &#8217;40s and early &#8217;50s, but now everyone uses it and, over a 40-year range, we&#8217;ve seen a dramatic increase in ocean plastic.&#8221; </p>
<p><div id="attachment_7047" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 302px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WaterSkeeter-e1337190170782.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/WaterSkeeter-e1337190170782.jpg" alt="Water Strider, courtesty of Scripps, photo by Anthony Smith" title="WaterSkeeter" width="292" height="198" class="size-full wp-image-7047" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Water Strider Finds Mid-Ocean Plastic Ideal Spot to Lay Eggs, courtesty of Scripps, photo by Anthony Smith</p></div>So dramatic in fact that her research shows the beginning of a significant shift in marine ecology as a result. A water-loving insect known as the water strider has begun laying eggs in the middle of the ocean by landing on fingernail-sized pieces of plastic that dot the ocean surface for thousands of miles. The flotsam in the gyre has created a suitable hard surface home for these bugs, which are generally found on lakes and ponds not in the open ocean.</p>
<p>Goldstein says the water striders &#8220;have exploited the influx of plastic garbage as new surfaces for their eggs [which] has led to a rise in the insect&#8217;s egg densities.&#8221; That&#8217;s good news for the predators that eat the insect, including crabs. And this ecological shift is very bad news for the critters that the bugs eat.</p>
<p>The study found that the explosion of the insects&#8217; population could lead to a dwindling supply in zooplankton and fish larvae, the water strider&#8217;s favorite foods. That can have devastating impacts up the food chain. The research noted a significant increase in egg-laying but didn&#8217;t comment on any resulting increase in adult water striders in the garbage patch. <div id="attachment_7049" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/microplastics.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/microplastics.jpg" alt="Microplastics Cleaned and Dried, courtesy of NOAA" title="microplastics" width="325" height="234" class="size-full wp-image-7049" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Microplastics Cleaned and Dried, courtesy of NOAA</p></div></p>
<p>Of all the plastic discarded into the ocean about 80 percent originates on land. And the floating pieces that don&#8217;t sink will eventually break down thanks to the sun&#8217;s energy and the pounding of waves. While those natural forces shred the material over time into smaller and smaller pieces, this micro-material gets ingested by marine birds and fish. </p>
<p>A similar study resulting from the same Scripps research expedition in 2009 found that nine percent of fish in the gyre had some plastic in their stomachs. That study published in <em><a href="http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v432/p173-180/">Marine Ecology Progress Series</a></em>, estimated the fish at intermediate ocean depths in the North Pacific Ocean could be ingesting plastic at a rate of roughly 13,000 to 26,000 tons per year.</p>
<p>And many of us have seen pictures of <a href="http://www.hawaiianatolls.org/research/June2006/albatross_death.php">young dead albatrosses</a> near Midway island who have starved to death because their stomachs are full of plastic which their mothers mistakenly feed to them thinking they are some other source of food.</p>
<p>Most scientists worry about the <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/08/090820-plastic-decomposes-oceans-seas.html">toxic plastic bioaccumulating in marine animals</a> and because of that Goldstein expected to see fewer water striders perched on mid-ocean plastic not more. But she was surprised to find that the insects seemed to be thriving in their new artificial environment.</p>
<p>She says, &#8220;The study raises an important issue, which is the addition of hard surfaces to the open ocean.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7050" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 216px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BarnaclesAnemonesRope.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BarnaclesAnemonesRope-e1337191253332.jpg" alt="Gooseneck Barnacles and Anemones on a Piece of Rope Found during 2009 SEAPLEX Expedition, courtesy of Scripps" title="BarnaclesAnemonesRope" width="206" height="275" class="size-full wp-image-7050" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gooseneck Barnacles and Anemones on a Piece of Rope Found during 2009 SEAPLEX Expedition, courtesy of Scripps</p></div>There is no seaweed floating on the surface between Hawaii and California. Occasional pumice (floating volcanic rock), seashells and other natural buoyant surfaces provide homes for barnacles, crabs, sea anemones and other creatures. The animals, the plants and the microbes that live on hard surfaces are different than the ones that live floating around in the water. And the addition of plastic is adding a whole new layer of surfaces in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p>The water strider is already taking advantage of this new micro-plastic habitat.</p>
<p>Goldstein says, &#8220;So, what plastic has done is add hundreds of millions of hard surfaces to the Pacific Ocean. That&#8217;s quite a profound change.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not every virus has a pathological purpose. Sure they make us sick regularly and terrorize our computers. But researchers at <a href="http://newscenter.lbl.gov/news-releases/2012/05/13/electricity-from-viruses/">Lawrence Livermore National Lab</a> in Berkeley have found a good use for harmless viruses &#8212; electricity generators.</p>
<p>Imagine walking down the street and charging your cellphone just from the motion of your feet. Scientists have been trying to capture the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity">piezoelectric effect</a> so that motion will create electricity and power our gadgets.</p>
<p>In new research at that appears in the journal <em><a href="http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nnano.2012.69.html">Nature Nanotechnology</a></em>, a team at LLNL found they can squish sheets of viruses between two plates and generate enough electricity to power a simple liquid-crystal display. It&#8217;s only the first step in generating electricity on the go but it&#8217;s an important one. </p>

<p><a href="http://leelab.berkeley.edu/">Seung-Wuk Lee</a> made a thin rubbery film from layers of genetically-engineered, non-toxic viruses, which are only harmful to the <em>e coli</em> bacteria into which they are inserted. He discovered that when pressure is applied the phage particles scatter and as they zip around a tiny spark of energy begins an electrical process which Lee and his team are confident can be scaled up to power phones, computers and other personal devices. </p>
<p>Lee says, &#8220;We ended up with trillions or jillions of these virus particles, which can generate the electricities.&#8221; He says the viruses cost nothing because they keep manufacturing themselves. Lee just adds water and waits. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage">Phage </a>can be produced simply and economically by infecting bacteria. The phage then co-opts the bacterial metabolism to continuously synthesize and secrete new phage particles, leading to millions of copies after culturing overnight.</p>
<p>A little ways off, Lee sees the big potential for this little science experiment.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Maybe 5 or 10 years later, we can begin to make very small, personalized electric generators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most piezoelectric generators &#8212; from <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2008/12/01/4-solutions-4-climate-change/">eco-friendly dance floors</a> in Europe to a little jacket worn by a <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2009/03/11/hamster-power/">hamster on a wheel at Georgia Tech</a>&#8211; use toxic and chemically treated wires to capture the kinetic energy being generated by mechanical motion. But the Berkeley experiment uses harmless viruses called phages. Common biotechnology techniques enable large-scale production of genetically modified phages so phage-based piezoelectric materials potentially offer a simple and environmentally friendly approach to piezoelectric energy generation.</p>

<p>The human brain may be more like a street map &#8212; laid out on a grid &#8212; than a tangled mess of spaghetti. Neuroscientists have been trying to unlock the structure of the brain to unravel mysteries of brain development and evolution, and help link neurological and psychiatric disorders to abnormalities in brain structure that occur in diseases like Alzheimer&#8217;s and Parkinson&#8217;s. But the long-held idea that the brain is a set of wires criss-crossing more or less at random has never quite fit with the simplicity and efficiency of natural selection. <div id="attachment_7077" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/PrimateBrainNeurology.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/PrimateBrainNeurology.jpg" alt="Primate Brain Neurology, Showing Grid-Like Patterning in Nerve Cells, image by Van Wedeen, Martinos Center and Dept. of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University Medical School" title="PrimateBrainNeurology" width="300" height="229" class="size-full wp-image-7077" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Primate Brain Neurology, Showing Grid-Like Patterning in Nerve Cells, image by Van Wedeen, Martinos Center and Dept. of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University Medical School</p></div></p>
<p>Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital are going out on a neurological limb to say the fiber architecture of the brain is as simple as anyone could imagine. They think that each pathway in the brain is one point in a three-dimensional grid not an isolated network that connects and disconnects at will.</p>
<p>New high-resolution images show a distinct grid pattern in the brain stem of a rhesus monkey. There is distinct left-right, up-down and front-back patterning shown in three axes, much like a three-dimensional street map.</p>
<p>Harvard professor <a href="http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/people/showPerson.php?people_id=196">Van Wedeen</a> and team found mind-blowing complexity can arise from a seductively simple underlying structure that follows a few simple rules and repeats them over and over. Wedeen argues that if you straighten out the folds in the brain it turns into a three-dimensional tapestry of interwoven fibers.</p>
<p>Using a brain mapping technique called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI">diffusion spectrum MRI</a>, Weeden insists that the images reveal sheets of parallel fibers running at 90 degrees to each another, much like a woven fabric. These sheets are also arranged at right angles to one another, completing a three-dimensional grid.</p>
<p>He says the pattern is easier to see in lower primates like the Galago bushbaby than it is in humans because we have more brain folds and curves giving us more complex brains.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7076" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BrainMap-e1337209470605.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BrainMap-e1337209470605.jpg" alt="Fiber Architecture of the Brain, image by Van Wedeen, Martinos Center and Dept. of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University Medical School" title="BrainMap" width="325" height="234" class="size-full wp-image-7076" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Fiber Architecture of the Brain, image by Van Wedeen, Martinos Center and Dept. of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University Medical School</p></div>Wedeen believes that brain fibers grow during embryonic development following a simple set of rules. He thinks biochemical signals determine which direction the fibers grow, much like how a city grid layout makes it easy to give directions to a destination.</p>
<p>And he thinks this simple structure might explain how complex brains evolved. If the brain were organized like a tangle of spaghetti, it would be difficult to see how mutations could lead to incremental changes in connectivity on which natural selection could act.</p>
<p>Wedeen says, &#8220;Try going into your basement and randomly rewiring your house. In a grid structure, it&#8217;s much easier to imagine changes in the developmental code producing adaptive changes in behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>But not everyone agrees with this simple approach to the complexity of brain architecture.</p>
<p><a href="http://neuroscience.wustl.edu/research/faculty.php?id=11">David Van Essen</a> says, &#8220;To me the jury is out.&#8221; He is the head of the <a href="http://www.humanconnectome.org/">Human Connectome Project</a>, a five-year federal program to elucidate the neural pathways that underlie human brain function. The goal? Deciphering this amazingly complex wiring diagram to see what makes us uniquely human and what makes every person different from all others. Of the current research Essen says, &#8220;My concern is that they may have oversimplified and overgeneralized in their optimism that this will apply brain-wide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The diffusion spectrum MRI technique gives great images but it doesn&#8217;t detect the nerve fibers directly. <a href="http://fsmweb.northwestern.edu/faculty/facultyProfile.cfm?xid=11876">Marsel Mesulam</a> says, &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at reconstructed images based on the movement of water molecules in a magnetic field.&#8221; It is not a microscope producing a literal image.</p>
<p>Van Essen thinks that this technique misses fibers that criss-cross in other orientations. <a href="http://www.iop.kcl.ac.uk/staff/profile/default.aspx?go=11688">Marco Catani</a>, a specialist in diffusion MRI at the King&#8217;s College London Institute of Psychiatry, argues that Wedeen&#8217;s method is likely to miss fibers crossing at angles less than about 70 degrees.<div id="attachment_7078" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/VanWedeenBrain.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/VanWedeenBrain-e1337210435334.jpg" alt="Van Wedeen, Associate Professor of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School and Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging" title="VanWedeenBrain" width="325" height="195" class="size-full wp-image-7078" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Van Wedeen, Associate Professor of Radiology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School and Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging</p></div></p>
<p>So for some, this simplified look at the brain is an oversimplification of much more complex geometry. </p>
<p>But Wedeen didn&#8217;t go searching for a simple answer to the complex organ. He says, &#8220;By looking at how the pathways fit in the brain, we anticipated the connectivity to resemble that of a bowl of spaghetti, a very narrow and discreet object.&#8221; But instead he found that the pathways in the top of the brain are all organized like woven sheets with the fibers running in two directions in the sheets and in a third direction perpendicular to the sheets. These sheets all stack together so that the entire connectivity of the brain follows three precisely defined directions.</p>
<p>Wedeen is adamant that his work would have detected fibers crossing at lower angles if they were common.</p>
<p>Now the focus of microscopic brain anatomy turns to study which view of the brain is most accurate. No doubt a flood of research answering the question of the human brain will follow.</p>
<p>With 100 billion neurons, each with around 10,000 connections, mapping the human brain will be no easy feat, and charting every single connection could take decades. That&#8217;s where the Human Connectome Project comes in. The HCP aims to map the large-scale connections of 1,200 human brains and is expected to start delivering the goods later this year.

<p>After a week of grueling physical and mental endurance tests in Seattle the iconic Space Needle announced that Gregory Schneider, a father from Tucson, Arizona has won a trip into sub-orbital space.<div id="attachment_7036" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 291px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GregorySchneider4.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GregorySchneider4.jpg" alt="Gregory Schneider, Winner of Space Race 2012" title="GregorySchneider4" width="281" height="273" class="size-full wp-image-7036" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gregory Schneider, Winner of Space Race 2012</p></div></p>
<p>Over 50,000 would-be astronauts entered the <a href="http://www.spaceneedle.com/spacerace2012/index.html">Space Race 2012</a> contest sponsored by the Seattle landmark, which celebrates its 50th Anniversary this year. </p>
<p>Decorated astronaut Buzz Aldrin was on hand at the end of the space race to announce the winner. He was intrigued by the contest and by the performance of the two finalists, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been kind of out and back,&#8221; he said, referring to venturing to the moon and to the bottom of the ocean, &#8220;but you wouldn&#8217;t catch me walking around that Space Needle. I&#8217;m afraid of heights.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7034" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GregorySchneider2.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GregorySchneider2-e1336779244788.jpg" alt="Gregory Schneider Walks the Space Needle&#039;s Outer Ring Answering Questions and Solving Puzzles" title="GregorySchneider2" width="325" height="189" class="size-full wp-image-7034" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Gregory Schneider Walks the Space Needle&#039;s Outer Ring Answering Questions and Solving Puzzles</p></div>The final test of the week-long final leg of this journey was to answer questions posted on the outside ring of the Space Needle. Schneider and his competitor Sara Cook, a 26-year-old diplomatic assistant at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, DC had to walk a narrow open-air catwalk that circles the top of the 525-foot Space Needle observation deck strapped into a safety harness.</p>
<p>After three other finalists were eliminated during the first two days of the competition, the two took turns climbing the antenna on top of the needle for time and then answering questions and solving puzzles as they walked around the &#8220;halo&#8221; of the Space Needle&#8217;s observation deck. Schneider answered the most questions (8 out of 10) to end up with the best time and Apollo 11 moonwalker Aldrin opened the envelope to read Schneider&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>After winning the spot on a future <a href="http://www.spaceadventures.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=suborbital.welcome">Space Adventures</a> sub-orbital flight the young father was overcome with emotion as he spoke while choking back tears. He says, &#8220;This is really thrilling for me. I think that space flight&#8230;and&#8230;the more people who get to see the world from a different perspective the closer we can all come.&#8221; <div id="attachment_7035" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 240px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GregorySchneider3.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GregorySchneider3.jpg" alt="Astronaut Buzz Aldrin Announces Schneider as Winner of Trip to Space" title="GregorySchneider3" width="230" height="259" class="size-full wp-image-7035" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Astronaut Buzz Aldrin Announces Schneider as Winner of Trip to Space</p></div></p>
<p>In his winning video he said he wants to go to space to &#8220;inspire my children, to turn their dreams into reality, to venture into the cosmos, and to understand the universe.&#8221;  He and his wife Lindsay have two children &#8211; Emi, 7 and Jude, 3. Like their father, Emi and Jude are interested in outer space. Gregory says, &#8220;[Jude] talks constantly about blasting off in a rocket ship, and I won&#8217;t be surprised when he eventually does.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Space Race program was launched in August 2011 and attracted applicants from around the country. One thousand entrants were randomly selected from that group and asked to submit videos detailing why they wanted to go into space. Then the judges selected twenty of those videos to post on the Space Needle&#8217;s Facebook page for public voting. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_7033" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 223px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GregorySchneider1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GregorySchneider1-e1336779491279.jpg" alt="Schneider about to Ascend the Antenna on Top of the Space Needle" title="GregorySchneider1" width="213" height="175" class="size-full wp-image-7033" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Schneider about to Ascend the Antenna on Top of the Space Needle</p></div>In his video, Schneider says, &#8220;The public determined the top five candidates, who were then flown to Seattle for the finals. In addition to Schneider and Cook, Lauren Furgason from Seattle; John Herman from Newmarket, New Hampshire; and Savan Becker from New York City, made it to the final competition. The top five performed mental and aerial acrobatics while floating in an indoor skydyiving facility. They raced remote-controlled rovers, and put together a simulated solar panel.</p>
<p>Gregory Schneider, from Tuscon, Arizona, is a recent law-school graduate from the University of Arizona, James E. Rogers College of Law now doing a clerkship with an appeals-court judge. He says his family is his motivation to go to space. He&#8217;s just about to graduate from law school, is expecting his third child later this year and now he&#8217;s going to space.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="http://eplayer.clipsyndicate.com/embed/iframe?pf_id=1&#038;show_title=0&#038;va_id=3478105&#038;windows=1" width="425" height="330"></iframe></p>
<p>Peru is ill-equipped to handle a coastal environmental emergency. Almost <a href="http://www.bluevoice.org/blog.php">900 dolphins washed ashore</a> on the nation&#8217;s northern beaches this winter and their deaths still remain a mystery, in part because the country lacks all the tools to test for diseases. Necropsies weren&#8217;t conducted in a timely manner as the animals showed up on beaches between January and April. By waiting too long to study the carcasses, biologists think that vital clues about the stranding may have been lost.</p>
<p>Before the dolphin disaster was over, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/peru-to-investigate-mass-die-off-of-pelicans-along-northern-coast-where-dolphins-recently-died/2012/04/29/gIQAB7pGqT_story.html">pelicans began dying in record numbers</a> along the same beaches, triggering concern from beach-goers and fishermen. Though it is fall in Peru and the prime tourist season is over, many surfers hang ten along 1,500 miles of coastline. And many Peruvians make their living from the sea and are worried that what might be harming dolphins and pelicans may also harm people.</p>
<p>But several leading scientists believe that the dolphin die-off and pelican deaths are completely unrelated. <div id="attachment_7019" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 330px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DeadBabyDolphinPeru.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DeadBabyDolphinPeru-e1336595050656.jpg" alt="One of Almost 900 Dead Dolphins along the Peruvian Coast, Photo Courtesy of Hardy Jones" title="DeadBabyDolphinPeru" width="320" height="184" class="size-full wp-image-7019" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">One of Almost 900 Dead Dolphins along the Peruvian Coast, Photo Courtesy of Hardy JonesOne of Almost 900 Dead Dolphins along the Peruvian Coast, Photo Courtesy of Hardy Jones</p></div></p>
<p>The Peru-based <a href="http://www.orca.org.pe/english.htm">Organization for Research and Conservation of Aquatic Animals</a> did 30 dolphin necropsies from some of the first cetaceans to wash ashore on February 12. <a href="http://www.oceanexpert.net/viewMemberRecord.php?&#038;memberID=16117">Carlos Yaipen-Llanos</a>, the group&#8217;s director, says they had broken ear bones, collapsed livers and internal hemorrhages, all signs of acoustic explosions.</p>
<p>He tells the <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2012/05/08/peru_dolphin_pelican_die_offs_appear_unrelated/">Associated Press</a>, &#8220;In microscopic exams we found fatty tissue with a great quantity surrounding bubbles and hemorrhages. This happens when there is a strong sound in the fatty tissue, in the mandibular fat where sounds are received.&#8221;</p>
<p>ORCA blames seismic sounding for oil deposits on the dolphin deaths. The Peruvian government denies that the animals died from seismic oil exploration being conducted by Houston-based BPZ Energy off the north coast of Peru between Feb. 8 and April 8. On April 27, BPZ announced a joint venture with Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. to explore and develop offshore oil drilling in the area where the dolphins died. The company <a href="http://ir.bpzenergy.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=663445">denies any involvement</a> in the almost 900 dead dolphins.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7020" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BPZoildrillingPeru.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BPZoildrillingPeru-e1336595142382.jpg" alt="BPZ Energy Map of Oil Exploration Block Z-1 off Coast of Peru, Courtesy of BPZ Energy" title="BPZoildrillingPeru" width="325" height="374" class="size-full wp-image-7020" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">BPZ Energy Map of Oil Exploration Block Z-1 off Coast of Peru, Courtesy of BPZ Energy</p></div>Dolphin defender <a href="http://www.bluevoice.org/about.php">Hardy Jones</a> hopped a plane to Peru to see what he termed the &#8220;greatest dolphin mortality events ever recorded.&#8221; When he arrived he joined the ORCA team and headed for the beach. In one day in late March, the team spotted over 600 dead and decomposing dolphins over an 85-mile stretch of beach.</p>
<p>Jones says, &#8220;We had counted 615 dead dolphins and had evidence of the tragedy and necropsy samples that might shed light on what had produced this catastrophe.&#8221;</p>
<p>But like so many marine die-offs, definitive answers are often impossible to find.</p>
<p>When the story was first reported, a few scientists thought that earthquakes in Chile were the culprit. Some thought algae blooms or disease could be responsible. Chemical runoff and near-shore pollution couldn&#8217;t be ruled out either. But based on initial reports from Dr. Yaipen-Llanos, the acoustic explosion theory holds the most water.</p>
<p>He tells Jones in an email from mid-February, &#8220;Now Hardy, what we found in this mass stranding is that 10 of the 17 animals found dead had broken periotic bones, that is, due to acoustic impact. The source of the impact was from the right side of the pod, since hemorrhagic internal ear was found in the right side of the stranded animals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other tests have ruled out heavy metal poisoning, biotoxin contamination, several common diseases and bacterial infections.</p>
<p>But what about the pelicans?</p>
<p>Probably unrelated to the dolphin die-off the deaths of over 4,500 pelicans along the same stretch of Peruvian coastline has people wondering what is happening to animals on the Pacific.</p>
<p>Again, no definitive proof can be gleaned but scientists think what&#8217;s killing juvenile pelicans began in January. That&#8217;s when the anchovy fishery near Lambayeque plummeted. Daily catches of 5 tons of anchovetas a day by fishermen dwindled so almost nothing about the time they started seeing the small fish dead on beaches.</p>
<p>Anvhovetas (the Spanish version of anchovies) require cool water. Biologist <a href="http://www.pewenvironment.org/research-programs/marine-fellow/id/85899371381">Patricia Majluf</a> believes that tongues of warm water began driving the small fish which is the main source of food for pelicans into deep waters, where the younger birds can&#8217;t reach them.</p>
<p>Carlos Bocanegra at the National University of Trujillo analyzed 10 dying pelicans last week and found they were starving. Many of the birds had empty digestive tracks or some evidence of fish that the birds generally don&#8217;t eat. Scientists believe that the dead and dying birds are 3-4 years old, an age when they can&#8217;t dive as deep for food as older birds. <div id="attachment_7021" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/PelicanDieOffPeru.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/PelicanDieOffPeru-e1336595514297.jpg" alt="Dead Pelicans on the Beaches in Pirua, Peru, Photo by REUTERS/Heinze Plenge" title="Dead pelicans are displayed by conservationists at Reventazon beach, close to the Illescas peninsula in Piura" width="325" height="215" class="size-full wp-image-7021" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dead Pelicans on the Beaches in Pirua, Peru, Photo by REUTERS/Heinze Plenge</p></div></p>
<p>Similar pelican die-offs in 1982-1983 and 1997-1998 coincided with strong El Ninos, which warm the oceans, forcing the feeder fish deeper where young birds can&#8217;t reach them. Could this be the beginning of another strong El Nino weather pattern?</p>
<p>Bocanegra says, &#8220;We saw mass deaths along Peru&#8217;s entire coast, also associated with high sea temperatures.&#8221; He says right now ocean temperatures in the region are 10 degrees above normal for this time of year.</p>
<p>This double marine die-off has scientists questioning Peru&#8217;s ability to handle coastal emergencies. As the dolphin disaster winds down &#8212; though rotting carcasses still line the beach &#8212; and the pelican problem ramps up health officials warned the public to <a href="http://ca.reuters.com/article/topNews/idCABRE8440E820120506">stay away from beaches</a> from Lima northward, though the Health Ministry didn&#8217;t identify a specific health issue.</p>
<p>One economist says these die-offs highlight Peru&#8217;s lack of readiness. <a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&#038;sl=es&#038;u=http://www.ecocostas.org/index.php/membresias/334-juan-carlos-sueiro&#038;ei=dtCqT4vUJISdiQKQmpmbCQ&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=translate&#038;ct=result&#038;resnum=2&#038;ved=0CCwQ7gEwAQ&#038;prev=/search%3Fq%3DJuan%2BCarlos%2BSueiro%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3Djnt%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Dimvnso">Juan Carlos Sueiro</a> says, &#8220;Peru doesn&#8217;t have a policy of coastal territory management.&#8221; He calls it &#8220;probably the most backward in the entire region.&#8221;</p>
<p>And for an area so rich in biodiversity thanks to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humboldt_Current">Humboldt Current</a>, which funnels cold, nutrient rich water along the coastline from Chile to Peru. It is the most productive marine ecosystem in the world, as well as the largest upwelling system. That has marine biologists, like Sue Rocca, worried. </p>
<p>She says, &#8220;One of the things we do know is just how fragile we have discovered our ecosystems have become.&#8221; </p>
<p>These die-offs show that slight alterations to the natural environment have big consequences.</p>

<p>35 million sheep and 8 million cows animals are emitting more than 50 percent of the greenhouse gas New Zealand produces. That is why scientists at the <a href="http://www.nzagrc.org.nz/">Agricultural Greenhouse Gas Research Center</a> are studying ways to reduce the potency of their methanated burps and high-nitrogen urine.</p>
<p>Farmers in the U.S. have been studying ways to reduce cow flatulence, which releases methane into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, more than 20 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide though it only stays suspended in the atmosphere for 9-15 years (compared to CO2&#8242;s 100-year atmospheric lifespan.)</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/05/us/05cows.html?pagewanted=all">Stoneyfield Farm Experiment</a> proved to be effective in reducing methane output by 18 percent on some farms by adjusting animal feed to include more alfalfa and flaxseed and less corn and soy. And climate scientists believe that improving cow breath needs to be a top priority. <div id="attachment_7010" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CowsMethane.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CowsMethane-e1336503689100.jpg" alt="In The U.S. Cattle Account for 20 Percent of Methane Emissions" title="CowsMethane" width="325" height="191" class="size-full wp-image-7010" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">In The U.S. Cattle Account for 20 Percent of Methane Emissions, According to the EPA</p></div></p>
<p>Cows have digestive bacteria in their stomachs that help them break down food but in the process they belch methane, the second-most-significant heat-trapping emission associated with global warming after carbon dioxide. </p>
<p>As transportation improvements, energy efficiency and other preventive global warming measures are being studied the agricultural sector is playing a role, too. According to the United Nations, worldwide animal emissions (mostly from 1.2 billion cows) account for 18 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>Peter Janssen at the New Zealand ag center is working on a number of ways to reduce cow and sheep emissions. Like in Vermont he is altering animal feed to test which grains and grasses reduce methane output. He is even injecting a vaccine or a methane inhibitor in an effort to reduce the methane output from cows.</p>
<p>Ultimately he is trying to understand how the amounts of methane changes with different treatments.</p>
<p>Also at the New Zealand ag center <a href="http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/research/staff_page.asp?staff_num=194">Surinder Saggar</a> is looking at sprays that can be used on grazing pastures to reduce the nitrous oxide that goes into the atmosphere and increases the nitrogen the ground absorbs.</p>
<p>And all for good reason.</p>
<p>A group of scientists just published a study showing that massive methane expulsions from dinosaur dietary tracts may have been significant enough to create a global-warming induced mass extinction.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_7011" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BrachiosaurusEating.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/BrachiosaurusEating-e1336504021875.jpg" alt="Brachiosaurus and Other Sauropods Produced Large Methane Quantities, Equal of all Animal and Industrial Emissions Today" title="BrachiosaurusEating" width="325" height="372" class="size-full wp-image-7011" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brachiosaurus and Other Sauropods Produced Large Methane Quantities, Exceeding of Animal and Industrial Emissions Today</p></div>Some are calling for the plant-eating brachiosaurus to be renamed gassiosaurus after scientists extrapolated their methane emissions to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 520 million tons per year. Like cows and camels these dinosaurs probably possessed methane-producing bacteria that helped them digest fibrous foods.</p>
<p>Scientists don&#8217;t know what kind of bacteria lived in the stomachs of these giant herbivores, which gases they produced or even what the dinosaur digestive track looked like. </p>
<p>Lead author David Wilkinson from Liverpool John Moores University and study coauthor Graeme Ruxton from the University of St Andrews were studying sauropod ecology when a question dawned on them: If modern cows produce enough methane gas to be of interest to climate scientists, then what about sauropods? They teamed up with methane expert Euan Nisbet at the University of London to work out the numbers. </p>
<p>Wilkinson supposed the bacteria was very similar to those in cows today. Starting with that as his hypothesis, he and his team used a mathematical model to estimate what level of emissions plant-eating dinosaurs were producing. They took a middle of the road approach to their calculations and wound up with startling results.</p>
<p>Large dinosaurs produced as much methane tens of millions of years ago as modern animals and all manmade sources combined today. In fact, the numbers are startlingly close. The total number of tons of methane produced by manmade and natural sources is almost equal to what the dinosaurs emitted themselves 250-65 million years ago.</p>
<p>Wilkinson says, &#8220;I was expecting a number like that produced by cows, so the size of the number really surprised me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cows produce 55 to 110 million tons of methane per year. Wilkinson and his team determined dinosaurs produced about 520 million tons though there is no way to confirm that. Current animal and manmade methane emissions total about 500 million tons per year. The study will be published in <em><a href="http://download.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/PIIS0960982212003296.pdf?intermediate=true">Current Biology</a></em> this week.</p>
<p>If the levels were anywhere near where the calculations indicate, Wilkinson says, it very well could have been one of many factors that made that era warmer and wetter than modern times.</p>
<p>He adds, &#8220;Indeed, our calculations suggest that these dinosaurs could have produced more methane than all modern sources—both natural and man-made—put together.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.luketipple.com/">Luke Tipple</a> is a shark advocate. The marine biologist and television host reveres the misunderstood fish. So it was a bit curious to find out that he decided to mount a laser on a shark in a real-life reenactment of the villainous fictional musings of Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies.</p>
<p>With a little prodding from laser maker <a href="http://www.wickedlasers.com/">Wicked Lasers</a> in Hong Kong who offered to fund some of his research, Dr. Tipple decided to turn a publicity stunt into a science opportunity. He found a somewhat willing male lemonshark (who he affectionately named Mr. Bigglesworth) swimming in the Caribbean for the experiment.</p>
<p>On his website, Tipple says that he chose the lemon shark because they are relatively slow-moving during the day, they like the shallow clear waters of the Bahamas and they have a big dorsal fin ideal for attaching a laser-mounted clip.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the video that Wicked Lasers commissioned, showing a shark swimming with a laser attached to its dorsal fin. Tipple says this video makes sharks appear cool to a frightened human audience who mostly associate sharks with being bitten or killed. Sharks are apex predators but so are humans.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-v7k6-eEBrk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>When the laser company approached Tipple in March he said, &#8220;My first thought was, um&#8230; no. There&#8217;s really no reason to do it and it was obviously just a publicity stunt.&#8221; </p>
<p>But after talking to the company&#8217;s owner &#8212; who apparently has a deep affection for sharks too &#8212; Tipple tweaked the original the mission and added ome scientific rigor. In exchange for 15 minutes of sensational underwater footage of a shark tooling around the ocean with a green laser beam projecting from its dorsal fin, Tipple would test a non-invasive mounting technique and see if sharks are attracted or repelled by lasers.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Initially I rejected the idea as I thought it was simply just a stunt and, while it was very cool and Austin Powersy, I was only interested if we could find a real world or scientific application for the technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he did. <div id="attachment_6996" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 304px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LukeTipple3.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LukeTipple3.jpg" alt="Luke Tipple, Shark Advocate and Marine Biologist" title="LukeTipple3" width="294" height="366" class="size-full wp-image-6996" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Luke Tipple, Shark Advocate and Marine Biologist</p></div></p>
<p>As a marine biologist Tipple has always been &#8220;a bit uneasy&#8221; by the accepted practice of drilling tags into the dorsal fins of sharks (and other marine animals) to collect scientific data. He says it&#8217;s the most effective attachment process for expensive and informative electronic tags. But he still doesn&#8217;t like it and has been developing a gel clip that can attach easily to shark fins.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;I&#8217;m not saying that the data isn&#8217;t worth it or that the methodology is flawed, but I do like the idea of exploring less invasive ways in which to attach scientific packages to sharks (and even other marine animals).&#8221;</p>
<p>The Wicked Lasers offer presented an opportunity for him to showcase his clip and demonstrate a less-invasive way to attach sensors to sea creatures. He says, &#8220;I&#8217;m pleased that the experiment is getting so much attention and that we&#8217;ve demonstrated a secure, and temporary attachment protocol. It definitely warrants further research and work&#8230; but probably minus the lasers from now on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The clip has specially designed gel pads on the inside of the jaws which create a tactile surface interaction with the dermal denticles of the sharks skin. In other words, Tipple says, &#8220;Basically, it doesn&#8217;t move.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tipple attached his specially-designed clip to Mr. Bigglesworth for about 15 minutes but he says that the clip will stay on for up to 30 days before the seawater corrodes the zinc elements in the spring and it releases its grip on the shark&#8217;s fin and eventually falls off. </p>
<p>After the experiment, he reports that the shark seemed unfazed and that his test was a success.</p>
<p>Though Wicked Lasers holds a world record for most powerful handheld laser, which can be seen from space (apparently) and its products boast the brightness of 8,000 times that of the sun, require safety goggles and warn not to point directly at a person or animal, Dr. Tipple asked for the weakest member of the laser beam team.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;No animals (or divers) were put at any risk during this experiment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides testing the clip, Tipple is fascinated by the scientific opportunities that lasers offer when mounted on sharks.</p>
<p>Researchers could use sharks with lasers not to destroy enemy combatants but to study shark velocity and trajectory in real-time. Tipple says, &#8220;One implementation we have worked on for the laser tracking is to measure these two variables in relation to observed behavior.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scientists could use such information to understand the difference in a shark&#8217;s behavioral reaction to a person splashing in the surf or a wounded animal. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_6998" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 385px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SharkLaser.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SharkLaser-e1336427379695.jpg" alt="Male Lemon Shark Dons a 50mm Laser for the Camera" title="SharkLaser" width="375" height="249" class="size-full wp-image-6998" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Male Lemon Shark Dons a 50mm Laser for the Camera</p></div>While underwater with a shark and a laser Tipple decided to see if lasers could be used to hold sharks at bay. He says they can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>To test whether certain wavelengths of light repel sharks Tipple held the laser and knelt in the seabed, pointing the beam at the shark. A laser net or force field is a common gimmick used by online laser retailers. If lasers harmlessly nudge the fish away from an area, then a laser fence could be constructed to keep swimmers and sharks separated near beaches with frequent shark attacks.</p>
<p>Tipple says, &#8220;If it turned out to be true imagine if we could virtually net off a swimming area without causing harm to the sharks.&#8221;</p>
<p>During his experiment he didn&#8217;t shine the laser directly in the shark&#8217;s eyes and turned the beam off as soon as the sharks snout crossed it. If pressed Tipple would say that his quick experiment on shark reaction to a laser beam is the opposite of the hypothesis. Not only did the beam not repel sharks, Tipple says it seemed to get their attention and attract them. But he admits it was a crude test and more research needs to be done.</p>
<p>He says since sharks can&#8217;t go backwards they might just swim faster through a laser fence just to get through the beams. And he adds, &#8220;Viewed from an angle the laser is a bright point of green light and time and again the sharks seemed to swim over to me when they caught sight of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>If Luke Tipple can make sharks known for something other than hurting people then he&#8217;s all for it. As the managing director for the non-profit organization <a href="http://www.sharkfreemarinas.com/">Shark-Free Marinas</a>, Tipple is dedicated to one singular purpose, to reduce worldwide shark mortality. He does that by informing people about sharks, discouraging commercial fishermen from catching and killing sharks and he encourages sports fishing and resort marinas to prohibit the landing of any shark at a participating marina.</p>
<p>But all told, mounting a laser to a shark helped shine a bright light on the issue of attaching scientific tags to sharks and other marine life. It busted the myth used by laser makers that sharks don&#8217;t like light beams. And the publicity stunt made sharks cool&#8230;for a minute.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Editor’s Note: It&#8217;s Science Ditty Friday. Every Friday REALscience compiles a song (generally with an accompanying video) to kick your weekend off with a musical start. Have a favorite science song? Send it to <strong><a href="mailto:ditty@realscience.us">ditty@realscience.us</a></strong></em>.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="410" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ApZhIjMGoSs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration may need to pull a rabbit out of its hat &#8212; and fast &#8212; in light of recent news that a leadership conference planned for June would feature a magcician. Within days of the agency that monitors weather, climate and oceans announcing a solicitation for a motivational prestidigitator it withdrew the request.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MagicofChange.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MagicofChange-e1336163909608.jpg" alt="" title="MagicofChange" width="325" height="377" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6969" /></a></p></blockquote>
<p>The original bid notice, posted on <a href="https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&#038;mode=list&#038;tab=list&#038;_nfound=1">Federal Business Opportunities</a> website called for someone with a specific background in magic who could deliver &#8220;physical energizers, magic tricks, puzzles, brain teasers, word games, humor and teambuilding exercises.&#8221; It asked for the performer to create &#8220;a unique model of translating magic and principals of the psychology of magic, magic tools, techniques and experiences into a method of teaching leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>But a Washington government watchdog magazine made the whole idea disappear before NOAA&#8217;s very eyes.</p>
<p>A few members of Congress weighed in on the issue, which most would chalk up to poor decision-making (though the fixed cost was only to be $3,500.)</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MagicofChange1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MagicofChange1-e1336163948833.jpg" alt="" title="MagicofChange1" width="325" height="382" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6970" /></a></p></blockquote>
<p>House Science Committee Chairman Ralph Hall, (R-TX) gave NOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco a week (which expires on May 11) to explain her agency&#8217;s decision and he is asking for details about past spending on magicians and comedians.</p>
<p>Senator Scott Brown, (R-MA) says &#8220;This is a low point even by Washington&#8217;s standards&#8221; and he added, &#8220;The best magic that NOAA could perform would be to make this wasteful spending disappear.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s what happened within days of the May 1 posting. So the day-long session at a quarterly training exercise put on by NOAA and the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which part of Commerce’s Leadership Effectiveness and Advancement Program, will not feature a &#8220;magic of change&#8221; session.</p>
<p>Patricia McBride-Finneran, the NOAA administrative officer who placed the solicitation told <em><a href="http://www.govexec.com/management/2012/05/noaa-seeks-magician-training-conference/55565/">Government Executive</a></em> magazine, &#8220;This is a program in which we train potential managers &#8212; just a one-day conference, where we teach about different things that pertain to government, such as working with Congress.&#8221; It is only intended for an audience of 45 federal workers.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MagicofChange2.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/MagicofChange2-e1336163997724.jpg" alt="" title="MagicofChange2" width="325" height="154" class="alignright size-full wp-image-6971" /></a></p></blockquote>
<p>This comes a little over a month after the General Services Administration found itself in hot water over extravagant spending at a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gsa-chief-resigns-amid-reports-of-excessive-spending/2012/04/02/gIQABLNNrS_story.html">Las Vegas training conference</a> in 2010. There the agency hired a clown and a (self-proclaimed) mind reader. A meetings planner who reviewed the spending for the biannual Western Regions GSA training conference says that the GSA overspent, including spending $130,000 on six scouting trips before the group met in October 2010. Some question whether a training conference like this (which included staff from four out of 11 regions) is necessary at all.</p>
<p>Steve Ellis, vice president for the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense tells the Associated Press he&#8217;s surprised that NOAA would try to hire a magician after the GSA scandal raised people&#8217;s awareness about silly conference spending.</p>
<p>Next week the Republican-controlled House of Representatives will act on NOAA&#8217;s budget bill. Since NOAA has been a target Republican budget cutting efforts in the past it might behoove the important scientific agency to steer clear of the illusion of government waste, less Congressional budget choppers saw it in half. </p>

<p>Type-2 diabetes used to be called adult-onset diabetes. But that had to change when so many kids, some as young as 5, began contracting the disease that stems from poor nutrition and obesity.<div id="attachment_6956" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 329px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DiabeticKids.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DiabeticKids.jpg" alt="Overweight and Sedentary Kids Have Higher Risk of Type-2 Diabetes, Photo courtesy of Digital Vision" title="DiabeticKids" width="319" height="208" class="size-full wp-image-6956" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Overweight and Sedentary Kids Have Higher Risk of Type-2 Diabetes, Photo courtesy of Digital Vision</p></div></p>
<p>Now fully one-third of all kids between the ages of 10 and 17 are on track to get diabetes because they are overweight. That means people are living with this chronic disease from an early age and it will follow them throughout their lifetime.</p>
<p>University of Sydney researcher <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/molecular_bioscience/cphn/about_us/staff.php">Tim Gill</a> says, &#8220;With diabetes developing younger in life, it means people now have the disease for a longer period and will move onto more intensive and expensive therapy earlier, and require it longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctors are seeing cirrhosis in seven-year-olds and strokes in five-year-olds. And kids are having heart attacks at age 20. </p>
<p>In our super-sized society, a sedentary lifestyle in front of the TV or computer combined with fast food nutrition is creating a national health crisis.</p>
<p>And one that may be worse than doctors realized.</p>
<p>A four-year study just wrapped up and found that it&#8217;s much tougher to treat diabetes in children 10-17 than in adults. Scientists also found that diabetes develops much faster in this age population and is difficult to combat with three standard therapies.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/doctor.aspx?ID=16595">Dr. David M. Nathan</a> led the study and says, &#8220;It’s frightening how severe this metabolic disease is in children.&#8221; The director of the diabetes center at Massachusetts General Hospital adds, &#8220;It’s really got a hold on them, and it’s hard to turn around.&#8221; </p>
<p><div id="attachment_6957" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DiabetesFatBoyMeasured.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DiabetesFatBoyMeasured-e1336156162262.jpg" alt="Girth of Youth Worries Doctors, Photo courtesy of Peter Dazeley/Getty Images" title="DiabetesFatBoyMeasured" width="325" height="263" class="size-full wp-image-6957" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Girth of Youth Worries Doctors, Photo courtesy of Peter Dazeley/Getty Images</p></div>About 700 overweight and obese U.S. children and teens were given three therapies in the study: The oral drug metformin alone; that medicine combined with GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)’s Avandia; and metformin used alone with diet and exercise. And throughout the study researchers found high failure rates among all treatments. The results of the study were just published in <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1109333">New England Journal of Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>Most doctors agree that starving the obesity crisis starts with a heavy helping of prevention. Parents need to jump in and make their children understand that diabetes once contracted is a lifelong disease. The honorary president of the Brussels-based <a href="http://www.idf.org/">International Diabetes Federation</a> says, &#8220;We don’t have a solution to this except to do better things about prevention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since 1980 the number of cases of child-onset diabetes has tripled. Every year 3,600 kids become diabetic, adding to the eventual healthcare costs for us all. The National Diabetics Education Program estimates at about 215,000 kids have diabetes. While most of those are type-1 the type-2 kids are catching up.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.idf.org/node/1214?unode=2964344A-A00C-43BB-8FB5-0F0E3D3941A7">Dr. Paul Zimmet</a> says, &#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to tell a 12-year-old that they&#8217;re going to be on medication for the rest of their life.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nbdiabetes.org/?page_id=334">Robin Goland</a>, a member of the research team and co-director of the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center at Columbia University Medical Center in New York tells the <em>New York Times</em>, &#8220;The research is the first large study of Type 2 diabetes in children, &#8216;because this didn’t used to exist.&#8217;&#8221;<div id="attachment_6959" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/YMCAdiabetesPrevention.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/YMCAdiabetesPrevention-e1336156620840.jpg" alt="Healthy Nutrition Lowers Diabetes Risk, Photo courtesy of YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program" title="YMCAdiabetesPrevention" width="325" height="279" class="size-full wp-image-6959" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Healthy Nutrition Lowers Diabetes Risk, Photo courtesy of YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program</p></div></p>
<p>Prior to the 1990s type-2 diabetes in kids was almost unheard of and now it is starting to outpace type-1 also known as juvenile diabetes.</p>
<p>Both forms of the disease cause high blood sugar, but their underlying causes are different.</p>
<p>Type 1 occurs when the patient begins destroying pancreatic cells that make insulin, a hormone that controls blood sugar levels. For this type, patients must take insulin.</p>
<p>Scientists don&#8217;t yet understand why people are getting type-2 diabetes but they know that inactive and obese people seem to develop the disease when they gain weight. There is also a genetic predisposition both to the disease and to put on weight, both of which may be involved in the onset of the disease. In type-2 diabetes the pancreas still produces insulin &#8212; though not enough &#8212; and the body doesn&#8217;t process it properly. That leads to a common condition called insulin resistance. Type-2 diabetics often have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Many people can be adequately treated initially by changing their diets, exercising and taking a pill. But eventually most need insulin to control the disease.</p>
<p>Poorly controlled diabetes leads to more severe health problems, including eye problems, nerve damage, heart disease, kidney failure and amputations. Since the childhood type-2 diabetes study showed how difficult it is to control the disease in the hormone-filled teen years, in theory, kids who develop diabetes could begin suffering chronic complications much earlier in life than previous generations who became diabetic as adults. Dr. Nathan is worried about what this means for young people. </p>
<p>He says, &#8220;I fear that these children are going to become sick earlier in their lives than we&#8217;ve ever seen before.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Canadian government wants to know exactly what its scientists are saying to the media. A few months ago the Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper tightened a five-year-old <a href="http://www.desmogblog.com/sites/beta.desmogblog.com/files/media%20relations%20protocol.pdf">communications policy at Environment Canada</a> where it began watching and recording what the agency&#8217;s scientists are saying, especially about climate change, wildlife and the Arctic. <div id="attachment_6942" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CanadianMediaRelationsProtocolRationale.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CanadianMediaRelationsProtocolRationale-e1336149732361.jpg" alt="Page from November 2007 Media Relations Protocol, Environment Canada" title="CanadianMediaRelationsProtocolRationale" width="325" height="249" class="size-full wp-image-6942" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Page from November 2007 Media Relations Protocol, Environment Canada</p></div></p>
<p>The protocol has been in effect since November 2007 but a polar conference in Montreal at the end of April presented rare opportunity to see the <a href="http://fairwhistleblower.ca/content/media-minders-keep-tabs-federal-scientists">science minders en masse</a>. At a conference of hundreds of scientists from all over the world it was easy to spot the Canadian ones &#8212; they all had shadows, hanging on their every word.</p>
<p>A week before the <a href="http://www.ipy2012montreal.ca/">International Polar Year conference</a> began all Environment Canada scientists received an e-mail with their muzzled marching orders. It says, &#8220;If you are approached by the media, ask them for their business card and tell them that you will get back to them with a time for interview. Send a message to your media relations contact and they will organize the interview. They will most probably be with you during the interview to assist and record.&#8221;</p>
<p>The memo, signed by Kristina Fickes, an Environment Canada senior communications adviser, goes on to say that recordings of interviews are to be forwarded to the department’s media relations headquarters in Ottawa.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6949" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CanadianScienceMinder.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/CanadianScienceMinder-e1336151540305.jpg" alt="Science Minder (L) and Canadian Scientist (R) at Montreal IPY Conference in April" title="CanadianScienceMinder" width="325" height="212" class="size-full wp-image-6949" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Science Minder (L) and Canadian Scientist (R) at Montreal IPY Conference in April</p></div>Mark Johnson, an Environment Canada spokesman, Tells Postmedia News that there is nothing unusual about the plan, which he describes as &#8220;standard practice&#8221; and consistent with the government’s overall communication policy.</p>
<p>It may be consistent with the government&#8217;s communication policy but many believe that there is a warped obsession with information control within the Harper government.</p>
<p>A senior Environment Canada scientist who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussions from Ottawa says, &#8220;Until now such a crude heavy-handed approach to muzzle Canadian scientists, prior to a significant international Arctic science conference hosted by Canada, would have been unthinkable.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that the memo is clearly designed to intimidate Environment Canada scientists. He calls the move unethical and says it&#8217;s very embarrassing to those in the international world of science. </p>
<p>University of Victoria climate scientist <a href="http://climate.uvic.ca/people/weaver/">Andrew Weaver</a> says the government&#8217;s email instructions to polar scientists is &#8220;unbelievable.&#8221; A vocal critic of the federal government silencing and muzzling scientists for several years he says, &#8220;It&#8217;s going from bad to worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weaver says having media minders take charge of arranging interviews and sending copies of the recordings to Ottawa is reminiscent of the way the Soviet Union used to send KGB agents to conferences with scientists during the Cold War. He says Weaver. &#8220;It’s an affront to democracy.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one knows exactly what prompted the government-wide policy but its had the chilling effect of reducing media coverage on climate change by 80 percent since going into effect in 2007. And during that time the number of media strategists, information officers and science minders on the federal payroll has risen to almost 4,500.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6945" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 180px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/KristiMiller.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/KristiMiller.jpg" alt="Dr. Kristi Miller, Barred from Speaking to Press Because Her Research Found Too Many Salmon Are Dying" title="KristiMiller" width="170" height="264" class="size-full wp-image-6945" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dr. Kristi Miller, Barred from Speaking to Press Because Her Research Found Too Many Salmon Are Dying</p></div><a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/04/18/audio-aih-snow-scientist-muzzling.html"></a><a href="http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/facilities-installations/pbs-sbp/mgl-lgm/geno/staff-personnel/index-eng.htm">Kristi Miller</a>, the head of molecular genetics at Fisheries and Oceans Canada says that she was barred from speaking to reporters at a conference last November where her published work on declining salmon stocks was being presented.</p>
<p>At the time she said, &#8220;I cannot speak to the press&#8230;it&#8217;s an unfortunate situation and I do hope that this policy doesn&#8217;t not undermine the public credibility or relevance of Canadian government science.&#8221;  </p>
<p>After the Montreal polar conference memo went public on April 25, Environment Minister <a href="http://www.peterkent.ca/home">Peter Kent</a> defended the policy, calling it standard practice. He said, &#8220;Communications management is a widely respected and essential tool of any large organization.&#8221; He went on to say, &#8220;Our scientists are free to address questions regarding science but my friends should remember that when it comes to policy issues ministers speak for the department.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weaver says, &#8220;The current administration in Canada feels it&#8217;s really important to control the information that&#8217;s being disseminated to the public.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;There is a fear about science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Weaver also says the instructions to polar scientists are also &#8220;absurd&#8221; since anyone — including a journalist — is allowed to ask questions after presentations at scientific conferences. It is also common for the media to conduct impromptu interviews with speakers immediately following sessions to clarify details before filing stories on tight deadlines.</p>
<p>In February, Canadian journalists protested, demanding the government allow more open media access to federal scientists. Two weeks later, one of the world&#8217;s leading scientific journals, <em>Nature</em>, accused Canada of <a href="http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20120302/journal-nature-tells-canada-to-stop-muzzling-scientists-120302/">muzzling its scientists</a>. <div id="attachment_6946" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DavidTarasick.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/DavidTarasick-e1336150386301.jpg" alt="David Tarasick, Barred from Discussing His Ozone Hole Findings until Government Said He Could Talk" title="OZONE-TARASICK" width="325" height="243" class="size-full wp-image-6946" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David Tarasick, Barred from Discussing His Ozone Hole Findings until Government Said He Could Talk</p></div></p>
<p>Environment Canada scientist <a href="http://www.ec.gc.ca/scitech/default.asp?lang=En&#038;n=F97AE834-1&#038;xsl=scitechprofile&#038;xml=F97AE834-A762-47A6-A2D9-9C397FD72F37&#038;formid=6C6D07FB-88C9-4227-AABE-462D19B78011">David Tarasick</a> was part of an international team involved in a study that found the largest recorded ozone hole above the Arctic. He was forbidden last fall by Environment Canada for several weeks from speaking to the media about the study or his part in it.</p>
<p>In Dr. Miller&#8217;s case, her salmon investigation seemed to suggest that fish might have been exposed to a virus associated with cancer. That suggestion raised many questions, including whether the virus might have been imported by the local aquaculture industry. But Miller couldn&#8217;t speak about it thanks to the government&#8217;s communications policy.</p>
<p>At the American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting held in February in Vancouver, many scientists, journalists and members of the public groused about the state of communication since Stephen Harper became Prime Minister in 2006.</p>
<p>Postmedia News reporter <a href="http://www2.canada.com/topics/news/cns_writers/margaret_munro.html">Margaret Munro</a> told a AAAS session that the muzzling of scientists is worse when the topic is controversial.</p>
<p>She says, &#8220;The more controversial the story, the less likely you are to talk to the scientists. They (government media relations staff) just stonewall. If they don&#8217;t like the question you don&#8217;t get an answer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Munro says because reporters were denied the opportunity to question Dr. Miller about her work, important public policy issues went unanswered.</p>
<p>She says, &#8220;You have a government that is micromanaging the message, obsessively. The Privy Council Office (which works for the Prime Minister, Stephen Harper) seems to vet everything that goes out to the media.&#8221; </p>
<p>But senior scientist <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/eosc/people/pedersen.htm">Thomas Pedersen</a> at University of Victoria says vital research on the environment and health is being suppressed. And he sees a political motive.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;The Prime Minister is keen to keep control of the message, I think to ensure that the government won&#8217;t be embarrassed by scientific findings of its scientists that run counter to sound environmental stewardship. I suspect the federal government would prefer that its scientists don&#8217;t discuss research that points out just how serious the climate change challenge is.&#8221;</p>
<p>With accusations of poor environmental policy and secrecy around oil extraction in the tar sands of Alberta, chemical pollution of the pristine Arctic and Canada&#8217;s withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol earlier this year, the Canadian government wants to keep set the conversation on its terms. That&#8217;s the number one rule of public relations. Unfortunately, it has to keep the public in the dark and the scientists silent to do that.</p>
<p>The 2007 communications protocol for Environment Canada scientists states, &#8220;Just as we have one department we should have one voice. Interviews sometimes present surprises to ministers and senior management. Media relations will work with staff on how best to deal with the call (an interview request from a journalist). This should include asking the programme expert to respond with approved lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Weaver calls it simply, &#8220;Orwellian.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since the 1960s theoretical phsycists have been working with a veritable <a href="http://images-of-elements.com/particle-zoo/">elementary particle zoo</a> that underlies the more familiar nucleic parts of atoms &#8212; electrons, protons and neutrons. And slowly over decades and with the help of expensive atom smashers those theorized particles are being experimentally observed, thus moving from theory into reality.<div id="attachment_6906" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Quarks-e1336006803907.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Quarks-e1336006803907.jpg" alt="Six Types of Quarks over Three Generations" title="Quarks" width="325" height="269" class="size-full wp-image-6906" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Six Types of Quarks over Three Generations</p></div></p>
<p>It all started with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann">Murray Gell-Mann</a>, who noticed that during a Stanford linear accelerator experiment where protons collided with electrons traveling near the speed of light that three shadowy blobs appeared inside the atomic nucleii. He called these new fundamental building blocks of atoms quarks. Protons and neutrons are the subatomic particles also known as baryons.</p>
<p>In particle physics, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon">baryon family</a> refers to particles that are made up of three quarks. Quarks form a group of six particles that differ in their masses and charges. The two lightest quarks, the so-called &#8220;up&#8221; and &#8220;down&#8221; quarks, form the two commonly known atomic components, protons and neutrons. Scientists have found all the baryons that are composed of the three lightest quarks &#8212; up, down and strange &#8212; quarks. But only very few baryons with heavy quarks have been observed in the lab. They can only be generated artificially in particle accelerators and are highly unstable.</p>
<p>Now several years after the <a href="http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html">Large Hadron Collider</a> below the Franco-Swiss border began recreating the moments following the Big Bang in the Universe particle physicists have put another theoretical particle puzzle to rest.</p>
<p>Cornell University physicist <a href="https://wiki.lepp.cornell.edu/lepp/bin/view/People/JimAlexander">James Alexander</a> says the discovery of the new Xi_b* (pronounced ky-bee-star) particle is &#8220;another brick in the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Xi_b* particle belongs to the so-called beauty baryons, particles that all contain a heavy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom_quark">bottom quark</a>, also known as a beauty quark.</p>
<p>Researchers from University of Zurich&#8217;s <a href="http://www.itp.uzh.ch/">Physics Institute</a> detected a baryon with one light and two heavy quarks. Xi_b* has one up, one strange and one bottom quark. With this observation by physicists Claude Amsler, Vincenzo Chiochia and Ernest Aguiló two of the three baryons theorized to have that usb composition have been experimentally observed.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://cms.web.cern.ch/">Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector</a> found evidence of the new particle&#8217;s rapid decay but didn&#8217;t see it directly because it is such a short-lived subatomic particle, existing for just a fraction of a second before decaying into 21 equally fleeting particles.</p>
<p>Following the discovery CMS physicist <a href="http://unizh.web.cern.ch/unizh/People/Vincenzo_Chiochia.htm">Vincenzo Chiochia</a>, a co-discoverer of the new particle, told <em><a href="http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2012/04/27/cms-collaboration-discovers-its-first-new-particle/">Symmetry Breaking</a></em> magazine, &#8220;Finding this particle is really very hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chiochia says, &#8220;Finding this complicated decay in such a messy event makes us confident in our abilities to find other new particles in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>CMS scientists believe they have confirmed Xi_b*&#8217;s existence to a sigma level of five, which means the researchers are 99.99 percent confident that the result is more than a chance occurrence.</p>
<div id="attachment_6907" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 570px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ParticleZoo.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ParticleZoo-e1336006926841.jpg" alt="Known and Theorized Subatomic Particles Make the Particle Zoo of the Standard Model" title="ParticleZoo" width="560" height="266" class="size-full wp-image-6907" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Known and Theorized Subatomic Particles Make the Particle Zoo of the Standard Model</p></div>
<p>The discovery of the new particle confirms the long-held theory of how quarks bind. It is part of quantum chromodynamics, which predicts how quarks combine to form heavy particles, but had never before been observed. It also helps to explain the strong interaction, one of the four basic forces of physics which determines the structure of all matter.</p>
<p>This is only the second particle discovery at CERN since the LHC began smashing atoms in 2008.</p>

<p>Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder but what the beholder beholds is just math. We don&#8217;t see math in a pretty face but it is math that makes it appear beautiful.<div id="attachment_6918" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 203px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GoldenSpiral.gif"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GoldenSpiral-e1336070444459.gif" alt="Golden Spiral Made from Whirling Triangles, Based on Fibonacci Sequence" title="GoldenSpiral" width="193" height="275" class="size-full wp-image-6918" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Golden Spiral Made from Whirling Triangles, Based on Fibonacci Sequence</p></div></p>
<p>Scientists have found the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldenRatio.html">Golden Ratio</a> throughout nature and the man-made world. It appears in the spirals of seashells and the great pyramids of Giza. It can be found in the Parthenon in Athens and all over your own body. Expressed as a number the Golden Ratio is 1.618. </p>
<p>It starts with the <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2011/10/21/nature-by-numbers/">Fibonacci Numbers</a> where every number (after the second) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For example 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21&#8230;</p>
<p>The Golden Ratio is derived by dividing the Fibonacci Numbers. For example 1/1=1, 2/1=2, 3/2=1.5, 5/3=1.666&#8230;, 8/5=1.6, 13/8=1.625, 21/13=1.61538&#8230;, 34/21=1.61905&#8230;, 55/34=1.61764&#8230;, 89/55=1.61861&#8230;</p>
<p>Like its neighbor irrational number Pi, the Golden Ratio or Phi has no equivalent fraction and the numbers after its decimal point go on forever. Though it is irrational it is very important in nature and demonstrates a high degree of efficiency. The Golden Ratio is found in the patterns we see in sunflowers, pine cones and even pineapples. This is largely because one of the best ways to efficiently pack things tightly together is using the Fibonacci sequence. Just look at the petals of flowers and leaves on many plants. They are designed to maximize sunlight and water transport. And they all utilize the Golden Ratio.</p>
<p>Population can be measured with this ratio in mind and we can even tell how attractive someone is by how they fit the Golden Ratio. A recent contest in England proved that.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6919" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 345px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FlorenceColgate.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/FlorenceColgate-e1336070654476.jpg" alt="Florence Colgate, Most Beautiful Face of Britain" title="FlorenceColgate" width="335" height="258" class="size-full wp-image-6919" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Florence Colgate, Most Beautiful Face of Britain</p></div>Over 8,000 women submitted pictures in Great Britain in hopes of being rated the most beautiful according to the Golden Ratio. Natural beauty is based on distances between prominent facial features and symmetry. It is the optimum ratio between the mouth, eyes, chin, and forehead.</p>
<p>18-year-old Florence Colgate took home the prize from Lorraine Cosmetics for her near-perfect symmetry and mathematically flawless face. The young seaside fish and chip fry girl who is studying for exams to study business management in college has been dubbed Britain&#8217;s most beautiful face and there is science to back up that claim.</p>
<p>Scientists at the <a href="http://www.perceptionlab.com/">St. Andrews University perception lab</a> determined that Colgate has a perfectly proportioned face. The distance between the eyes is 44 percent of the whole width of her face. The ideal golden ratio girl would have eye distance of 46 percent. Experts also believe the relative distance between eyes and mouth should be just over a third of the measurement from hairline to chin. Colgate&#8217;s ratio is 32.8 per cent.</p>
<p>PhD student <a href="http://psy.st-andrews.ac.uk/people/pg/cel37.shtml">Carmen Lefèvre</a> says Colgate has all the classic signs of beauty. She says, &#8220;She has large eyes, high cheekbones, full lips and a fair complexion. Symmetry appears to be a very important cue to attractiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Colgate is the current mathematical beauty scientists have conducted several studies on attractiveness over the years and the most aesthetically pleasing people are closely aligned with the Golden Ratio. 1.618 gets repeated throughout nature and is the ideal for many body proportions.</p>
<p>For example, the ideal distance from the pupil of a person&#8217;s eye to the center of the chin is 1.618 times the distance from the pupil to the end of the nose. The ideal length of a face is also 1.618 times its width and 1.618 times the distance between the eyes and the person&#8217;s mouth. In other words, wherever you think classical beauty, you&#8217;re probably just responding to the beautiful symmetry and repeating mathematical perfection.<div id="attachment_6920" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GoldenRatioFaceMask.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/GoldenRatioFaceMask-e1336070776212.jpg" alt="RF Mask of Facial Beauty, Designed by Stephen Marquardt, Female (L), Male (R)" title="GoldenRatioFaceMask" width="325" height="195" class="size-full wp-image-6920" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">RF Mask of Facial Beauty, Designed by Stephen Marquardt, Female (L), Male (R)</p></div></p>
<p>It is the ratio between the length of your hand and the length of your lower arm (between your elbow and your wrist). It&#8217;s also the ratio of your total height to the distance between your head and your fingertips. It can even appear deep inside your cells in the structure of DNA. The DNA molecule measures 34 angstroms long by 21 angstroms wide for each full cycle of its double helix spiral. And a cross-section of a DNA double helix forms a decagon, which in essence is two pentagons rotated 36 degrees so each spiral of DNA double helix traces out a pentagon. And the ratio of the diagonal of a pentagon to its side is 1.618:1.</p>
<p>In 2007 scientists at Cambridge University found that the closer a woman&#8217;s hips to waist ratio is to 0.7 the sexier her walk is. So, a woman with 25 inch waist and 36 inch hips, has all she needs for a perfect walk. For men, a ratio of 0.9 shows a strong correlation with general health and fertility. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_6922" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JessicaAlbaRFMask1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JessicaAlbaRFMask1.jpg" alt="Jessica Alba, Modern Day Beauty, According to the Math" title="JessicaAlbaRFMask1" width="325" height="227" class="size-full wp-image-6922" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Jessica Alba, Modern Day Beauty, According to the Math</p></div>According to the mathematicians actress Jessica Alba&#8217;s sashay beat the competition, including Kate Moss, Angelina Jolie and even Marilyn Monroe, whose sexy strut made her famous. While the math team found Monroe was a fraction off the target ratio with 0.69, the Cambridge team said that Alba had the perfect proportions.</p>
<p>The report also reveals that singer Shania Twain and actresses Liz Hurley are ranked among perfectly formed celebrities.</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s an app to see where you fall on the scale of stunning. The Ugly Meter uses a virtual structure to measure your eyes, nose, mouth and the size and shape of your face. It then comes up with a rating based on the measurements and spits out a score based on a 100 point scale. Ugly Meter scans a user&#8217;s photo looking for contours, symmetry and proportions. <div id="attachment_6923" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JoeOverlineUglyMeter.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/JoeOverlineUglyMeter-e1336074131739.png" alt="Joe Overline, Ugly Meter App Maker" title="JoeOverlineUglyMeter" width="325" height="192" class="size-full wp-image-6923" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Joe Overline, Ugly Meter App Maker</p></div></p>
<p>Jo Overline made the app and admits that his ugly mug is just that. According to his own invention, he scores a measly 32. But he&#8217;s laughing all the way to the bank. The app he built at his company Dapper Gentlemen just knocked Angry Birds of its perch as the top-selling app in the iTunes store. </p>
<p>Arizona-based Overline started the $.99 app as a joke. But the $4.99 Pro version is much more scientifically robust, including using the Golden Ratio for facial symmetry.</p>
<p>He says Brad Pitt scores a 91 out of 100 on the Ugly Meter while a photo of Angelina Jolie gets an 86. The app suggests that her eyes are a bit too close together although the perfect size for her head. </p>
<p>While holding a smartphone up to a photo removes a lot of the scientific validity that went into building the app, it shows that mathematical proportion and symmetry underlie what we commonly view as beautiful.</p>

<p>When Ernest Callenbach wrote the environmental page-turner <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ecotopia-Ernest-Callenbach/dp/0553348477">Ecotopia </a></em>in 1975 he drew the vision of his environmental utopian society from the latest science available at the time. <div id="attachment_6888" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ErnestCallenbackEcotopia.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ErnestCallenbackEcotopia-e1335827227100.jpg" alt="Ernest Callenback Ecotopia" title="ErnestCallenbackEcotopia" width="325" height="255" class="size-full wp-image-6888" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Ernest Callenback, Author of Ecotopia, Dies at 83</p></div></p>
<p>The 83-year-old author died at his home in California earlier this month. His famous book sold over one million copies, became a mainstay in college classrooms and painted a portrait of a sustainable future, some of which we are just starting to realize.</p>
<p>In an interview several years ago, he said, &#8220;What has happened in the 30 years since I wrote the book in a million little ways people have begun to do Ecotopian things. Most of them don&#8217;t realize these are Ecotopian things. They&#8217;re just good business decisions or they&#8217;re an interesting technological thing that somebody has cooked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before his death from cancer on April 16 he said the world is moving in a decidedly Ecotopian direction where we are rethinking all of our processes &#8212; from household to manufacturing. They all have Ecotopian characteristics and Callenbach said the transitions would go faster if we just realized that.</p>
<p>He said, &#8220;Anytime somebody invents something that is better it turns out that it not only saves money which has to happen or they won&#8217;t do something in our society. But it will also save energy. It will probably take up less space. It will probably be more inherently efficient in terms of the physics and the mechanics of the processes and so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those are just some of the characteristics of Ecotopia.</p>
<p>Ernest found his footing when he founded the magazine Filme Quarterly in the late 1950s. He grew up on a chicken farm in Pennsylvania where his father taught poultry classes. Callenbach flew the coop and studied cinema in Paris before returning to the U.S. and venturing to University of California to be the assistant editor of the press.</p>
<p>He served as the magazine&#8217;s editor until 1991 while also editing the university&#8217;s California Natural History Guides.</p>
<p>But as much as he loved his work Callenbach was becoming increasingly concerned about water and sewage problems. Unable to get any publisher to print a futuristic novel about a world that solves its environmental problems he mustered up enough money from friends to self-publish <em>Ecotopia</em>. The book went on to sell over one million copies, became the founding document for the Green Party in Germany and left a lasting impression of a greener future.</p>

Set in a fictional future San Francisco the book opens with a journalist visiting the city 20 years after the great water wars. The only sounds that can be heard on Market Street are the hum of electric cars, the whir of bicycles and the gurgling of an urban stream. That vision is underway in many American cities. And in 2005, Seoul opened a downtown creek for people to splash.</p>
<p>Callenbach was an avid country music lover, especially the home-spun stylings of Tammy Wynette and Mary Lou Harris. But according to his son Hans his father who many called Chick held great musical appreciation for another reactionary with political flair, Tom Lehrer. </p>
<p>He tells REALscience, &#8220;In addition to being a man of ideas and words, Chick loved a good laugh and he had a mischievous side and a sly smile. I think he would smile thinking about this song, as an east-coaster who got to the west coast and could not believe what he saw and felt there, the Wild West. It will certainly stir up some commentary speaking to our carelessness as a species and need for us fix more things than we break.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><h3>The Wild West is Where I Want to Be</h3>
<p>By Tom Lehrer</p>
<p>Spoken intro:<br />
<em>Now if I may indulge in a bit of personal history, a few years ago I worked for a while at the Los Alamos scientific laboratory in New Mexico. I had a job there as a spy. No, I guess you know that the staff out there at that time was composed almost exclusively of spies&#8230; of one persuasion or another. And, while I was out there, I came to realize how much the Wild West had changed since the good old days of Wyatt Earp and Home on the Range, and here then is a modern cowboy ballad commemorating that delightful metamorphosis called The Wild West Is Where I Wanna Be.</em></p>
<p>Along the trail you&#8217;ll find me lopin&#8217;<br />
Where the spaces are wide open,<br />
In the land of the old A.E.C. (yea-hah!)<br />
Where the scenery&#8217;s attractive,<br />
And the air is radioactive,<br />
Oh, the wild west is where I wanna be.</p>
<p>Mid the sagebrush and the cactus,<br />
I&#8217;ll watch the fellas practice<br />
Droppin&#8217; bombs through the clean desert breeze.<br />
I&#8217;ll have on my sombrero,<br />
And of course I&#8217;ll wear a pair o&#8217;<br />
Levis over my lead B.V.D.&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Ah will leave the city&#8217;s rush,<br />
Leave the fancy and the plush,<br />
Leave the snow and leave the slush<br />
And the crowds.<br />
Ah will seek the desert&#8217;s hush,<br />
Where the scenery is lush,<br />
How I long to see the mush-<br />
room clouds.</p>
<p>&#8216;Mid the yuccas and the thistles<br />
I&#8217;ll watch the guided missiles,<br />
While the old F.B.I. watches me. (yea-hah!)<br />
Yes, I&#8217;ll soon make my appearance<br />
(Soon as I can get my clearance),<br />
&#8216;Cause the wild west is where I wanna be. </p>
<p>Music and lyrics by Tom Lehrer<br />
(c) 1960</p></blockquote>

<p>A fireball from space screamed across the weekend morning sky last Sunday, creating a sonic boom as it broke the sound barrier and shaking parts of California and Nevada. That was the signal from space that put Bob Ward, Scott Sanford and David Gheesling on the same trajectory. The three men came from Arizona, California and Georgia to try to find pieces of the minivan-sized meteorite that broke up over the Sierra Nevada foothills. <div id="attachment_6876" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MeteoriteHunterBobWard.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MeteoriteHunterBobWard-e1335456471623.jpg" alt="Meteorite Hunter Bob Ward Finds Fireball Fragments in Lotus, CA" title="MeteoriteHunterBobWard" width="200" height="155" class="size-full wp-image-6876" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Meteorite Hunter Bob Ward Finds Fireball Fragments in Lotus, CA</p></div></p>
<p>They all met in Lotus, a town born during the California gold rush in the 1800s.</p>
<p>Ward who runs <a href="http://www.ironfromthesky.com/">Iron from the Sky Meteorites</a> has been hunting meteorites for 20 years. When he heard about the fireball event last weekend he hopped in his car and drove 14 hours from Prescott, Arizona.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;This is an opportunity of a lifetime and this may never ever happen again in my lifetime.&#8221; As the first person to retrieve two pea-sized fragments of the meteorite Ward says his trip was well worth it.</p>
<p>He is quick to point out that this event is only the third time a meteorite has been known to fall in the state of California in recorded history. He says, &#8220;There is material in here that predates the formation of our sun &#8212; 4.8 billion years or older.&#8221;</p>
<p>A fireball event of this size happens about once a year somewhere in the world. But most of the time they occur over uninhabited areas or the ocean. And most of the meteors we incorrectly label shooting stars in the night sky are the size of dust or pebbles.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a huge scientific opportunity as well as being an exciting moment of treasure hunting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6878" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MeteoriteHunterScottSanford.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MeteoriteHunterScottSanford-e1335456559438.jpg" alt="NASA Meteorite Expert Scott Sanford Hunts Fireball Fragments" title="MeteoriteHunterScottSanford" width="200" height="146" class="size-full wp-image-6878" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">NASA Meteorite Expert Scott Sanford Hunts Fireball Fragments</p></div>Astrophysicist <a href="http://spacescience.arc.nasa.gov/staff/scott-sandford">Scott Sanford</a> also joined the hunt in Lotus. He is a research scientist with NASA Ames in the Bay Area who says the last time there was a meteorite finding event like this was in 1969. He wants to know where this rock came from before it raced across the morning sky and scattered across a ten-mile stretch of California between Lotus and Coloma. His goal is to collect as many rock fragments as possible and measure the composition to see what kind of meteorite it is.</p>
<p>When Ward found the first piece of the meteorite on Tuesday between a baseball field and a park, he knew it was a <a href="http://www.meteorite.fr/en/classification/carbonaceous.htm">carbonaceous chondrite</a> meteorite, a rare and exciting find. Scientists confirmed that the rock he found dates back to the early solar system, some 4-5 billion years ago. He could tell it was a &#8220;CM&#8221; meteorite because the nickel-sized rock showed &#8220;fusion crusts&#8221; which form during atmospheric entry on one side. Excitedly, Ward says, &#8220;It is one of the oldest things known to man and one of the rarest types of meteorites there is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without studying his find, he says it contains amino acids and organic compounds that are very important to science.<div id="attachment_6875" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 293px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MeteoriteFragmentsWard.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MeteoriteFragmentsWard.jpg" alt="First Two Remnants of Carbonaceous Chondrite Meteorite Found by Bob Ward" title="MeteoriteFragmentsWard" width="283" height="177" class="size-full wp-image-6875" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">First Two Remnants of Carbonaceous Chondrite Meteorite Found by Bob Ward</p></div></p>
<p><a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/deepimpact/science/dyeomans.cfm">Don Yeomens</a> from NASA&#8217;s Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory says the meteorite contains two of the most important chemicals that science seeks &#8212; carbon and a form of water. While this type of meteorite is very unusual, according to NASA scientists, it appears to be full of water (not in a liquid form) and out in space it would have made a good candidate for a new asteroid mining company that launched this week.</p>
<p>UCLA meteorite expert and cosmochemist <a href="http://cosmochemists.igpp.ucla.edu/Wasson.html">John Wasson</a> hopes that the hundreds of meteorite dealers and collectors who flock to the area this week will find big chunks of the space rock. He says it&#8217;s critical to recover as many fragments as soon as they can because rain will degrade the rocks, causing them to lose their sodium and potassium.</p>
<p>And it is worth hunting. The meteorite market can be quite lucrative. The going rate for a meteorite like this is about $10,000 per gram. The two pieces that Ward found are about 10 grams each.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6877" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 175px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MeteoriteHunterDaveGheesling.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MeteoriteHunterDaveGheesling.jpg" alt="Atlanta Meteorite Collector Dave Gheesling Joins Hunt in California" title="MeteoriteHunterDaveGheesling" width="165" height="181" class="size-full wp-image-6877" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Atlanta Meteorite Collector Dave Gheesling Joins Hunt in California</p></div>Private meteorite collector Gheesling from <a href="http://www.fallingrocks.com/About.htm">Falling Rocks</a> raced from Georgia to California because to him this is a big deal. He says, &#8220;These events are fairly rare.&#8221; Just having a big fireball event is a treat but he says recovering any material from the meteorite is even more rare.</p>
<p>And that makes the space rock fragments so valuable.</p>
<p>NASA Ames is organizing a meteorite search party this weekend in an effort to recover as much of the rock as they can before weather changes, turning a sleepy California village into a boom town once more.</p>

<p>The fledgling commercial space industry hasn&#8217;t even fully achieved liftoff and already there&#8217;s a new space start-up eager to pave the way for a whole new commercial space industry &#8212; mining. And in the process the company could expand the scope of natural resources as robotic spacecraft search the solar system for extractable precious metals and water to be used as rocket propellant.</p>

<p>The team thinks that gold, precious metals used in electronics and water can be found on near-Earth asteroids. And they are going to go look for it in the next couple of years.<div id="attachment_6865" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MiningAsteroids1-e1335395254795.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MiningAsteroids1-e1335395254795.png" alt="What a Future Asteroid Being Mined for Natural Resources Looks Like" title="MiningAsteroids1" width="325" height="235" class="size-full wp-image-6865" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What a Future Asteroid Being Mined for Natural Resources Looks Like</p></div></p>
<p>The plan is to send small commercially built spaceships to squeeze water and valuable minerals out of space rocks that regularly whiz by Earth. It will cost untold millions if not billions of dollars and may not amount to much. But if it all works, the payoff could be huge, revolutionizing how we view space travel and opening up the solar system for future generations.</p>
<p>Planetary Resources says it is poised to initiate prospecting missions targeting resource-rich asteroids that are easily accessible.</p>
<p>Right now, going to space is a lot like going camping. You have to take all your provisions with you, carry enough to get by until you return to Earth and you have to plan for surprises so you always pack more than you need.</p>
<p>Since we first put men on the moon in the 1960s scientific exploration has included the search for water and minerals that could be used in some far-off, science fiction-inspired future to fuel spacecraft and even establish permanent off-Earth settlements.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.planetaryresources.com/team/">seasoned team</a> at Planetary Resources announced their plans this week at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. Members who include NASA veterans responsible for the Mars rover program believe that process begins with the extraction of abundant natural resources contained in asteroids.</p>
<p>Dr. Diamandis recognizes that the idea is crazy. But he&#8217;s wanted to be an asteroid miner since he was a teenager.  He says, &#8220;I always viewed it as a glamorous vision of where we could go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The founder of the X-Prize Foundation which launched commercial spaceflight in the first place believes it&#8217;s not only possible but he is determined to make it happen in the next eight years. He says the company&#8217;s vision &#8220;is to make the resources of space available to humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>But before Planetary Resources can collect samples and cash in on the high price of gold here on Earth, they will have to do some real science to determine the make up of the asteroids they are targeting.</p>
<p>To be considered a good <a href="http://www.planetaryresources.com/asteroids/target-asteroids/">candidate asteroid</a>, it must be easier to get to from Earth than the moon. Planetary Resources has identified 1,500 space rocks left over from the formation of the solar system that fit the bill. And astronomers are finding more and more asteroids every year.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6866" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MiningAsteroids2.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MiningAsteroids2-e1335395513248.png" alt="Planetary Resources Spacecraft Scans Asteroid for Valuable Minerals and Water" title="MiningAsteroids2" width="325" height="191" class="size-full wp-image-6866" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Planetary Resources Spacecraft Scans Asteroid for Valuable Minerals and Water</p></div>Ideal asteroids will contain water clinging to minerals that can be extracted and separated into its component parts of hydrogen and oxygen, key elements in rocket fuel. Once the mining company (and likely others that will follow) figure out how to turn water into rocket fuel, asteroids can act as potential refueling stations on missions to and from deeper parts of space. That alone could rewrite the book on space exploration.</p>
<p>This would be the equivalent of going camping with electricity and running water as opposed to really roughing it. Right now, space travel is pretty rough all things considered. The ability to extract minerals could make it much more sophisticated in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Planetary Resources is not the only group looking at the suitability of asteroids. Since scrapping the idea to go back to the moon and to Mars in the next decade, NASA has trained its attention on asteroids with the intention of sending a manned mission to one by 2025.</p>
<p>But before people can zip off to an asteroid on the way to Mars or beyond, scientists who know very little about asteroids must develop a quick and easy way to look at a candidate space rock and determine its value from a resource perspective. To do that Planetary Resources is developing a fleet of explorer robots that can venture to near-Earth asteroids and take a took at their offerings.</p>
<p>They are looking for iron, nickel, gold, platinum and palladium. The Bellevue, WA-based company says some near-Earth asteroids contain platinum group metals (including ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and platinumin) in much higher concentrations than the richest mines on Earth.</p>
<p>The website says, &#8220;In space, a single platinum-rich 500 meter wide asteroid contains about 174 times the yearly world output of platinum, enough to fill a basketball court to four times the height of the rim.&#8221;</p>
<p>It has a similarly optimistic view of <a href="http://www.planetaryresources.com/asteroids/composition/">water on asteroids</a>. A single water-rich 500-meter-wide asteroid could contain 80 times more water than the largest supertanker could carry and could provide. And, according to Planetary Resources if the water were converted to rocket propellant it would equal over 200 times the rocket fuel needed to launch all the rockets in human history.</p>
<p>But do asteroids contain the treasure trove of minerals and water that Planetary Resources hopes? </p>
<p>Asteroid exploration has been part of the human space agenda since 1991 when <a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galileo/">spacecraft Galileo</a> fly by asteroid 951 Gaspra on its way to Jupiter. But in over 20 years the asteroid knowledge base hasn&#8217;t grown much. Every mission involving asteroids seems to rewrite what science knows about the space rocks.</p>
<p>Planetary Resources says, &#8220;Our knowledge of these celestial neighbors has been revolutionized by a small set of US and international missions carried out since that time. With each visit or fly-by, the science on asteroids has been rewritten.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the newest commercial space company and first in space mining aims to do just that.</p>
<p>It will all start with an array of small spaced-based telescopes.<div id="attachment_6867" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/LeoSpaceTelescope.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/LeoSpaceTelescope-e1335395672353.png" alt="Leo Space Telescope Gives Private Sector Access to Space Exploration" title="LeoSpaceTelescope" width="325" height="267" class="size-full wp-image-6867" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Leo Space Telescope Gives Private Sector Access to Space Exploration</p></div></p>
<p><em>Leo </em>will lead the charge. The small remote-sensing telescope will sit in low-Earth orbit looking for target asteroids. But Planetary Resources is designing Leo to be more than a rock lookout. The company says, &#8220;Leo is capable of surveying for near-Earth asteroids during one orbit, then be retasked for rain forest observation on the next. The possibilities for utility and engagement are only limited by the imagination of the user.&#8221;</p>
<p>It calls Leo &#8220;the first space telescope within reach of the private citizen.&#8221;</p>
<p>To date, space-based telescopes have been the provenance of government agencies and research institutions. And while our taxpayer dollars fund those projects, they remain out of reach for most.</p>
<p>Planetary Resources hopes to launch the first in a series of Leo telescopes within the next 18 to 24 months. The asteroid spotting sentinels will consist of several foot long tubes, weighing just a few pounds and should be small enough to hold in your hand. And they will each run about $10 million, according to company documents.</p>
<p>Though many scientists remain skeptical, Diamandis and his co-founder Eric Anderson have an established track record of profiting from various <a href="http://www.spaceadventures.com/">space ventures</a>. They led the industry in selling rides to space and Diamandis has a separate company that offers weightless plane flights.</p>
<p>Anderson says, &#8220;There will be times when we fail and there will be times when we have to pick up the pieces and try again.&#8221; But he says the benefits to humanity far outweigh the risk. He adds, &#8220;We do understand that the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, if it&#8217;s successful, will be big.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Ebbesmeyer">Curtis Ebbesmeyer</a> recently returned from Alaska, where he visited the area near where the first fishing boat drifted into American coastal waters after being washed out to sea following the devastating Japanese tsunami in March 2011.</p>
<p>The Seattle-based consulting oceanographer has been tracking wayward <a href="http://cnn.at/2003/TECH/science/05/26/coolsc.oceansecrets/index.html">Nike shoes, rubber duckies and hockey gloves</a> for 25 years. In fact, he is known as one of the top flotsam experts in the world and is the author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0061558419/">Flotsametrics and the Floating World</a></em>. And with decades of practice he&#8217;s pretty good at predicting what will float past thanks to wind patterns and ocean currents. <div id="attachment_6848" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JapaneseTsunamiDebrisIsland.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JapaneseTsunamiDebrisIsland-e1335309046313.jpg" alt="Japanese Tsunami Debris Island off Coast of Japan, courtesy of US Navy" title="JapaneseTsunamiDebrisIsland" width="325" height="235" class="size-full wp-image-6848" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Japanese Tsunami Debris Island off Coast of Japan, courtesy of US Navy</p></div></p>
<p>He predicted that the U.S. mainland would start seeing the most buoyant pieces of <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2012/01/18/debris-from-japanese-tsunami-hits-u-s/">debris from Japan</a> sometime this year. After studying drifting ships and other things that float, he thought the first of dozens of Japanese fishing boats would begin to hit the U.S. west coast in February.</p>
<p>Many other scientists thought that was a bold prediction and one that seemed too early by their standards. When the first Japanese boat found its way to the north Pacific waters off Canada, Ebbesmeyer thought the sighting was a bit later than he thought.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Judging by the devastation in Japan I was expecting dozens of boats. You know we have about 100 boats that we&#8217;ve recorded in the last 200 years so I was expecting a boat in February. I was a little surprised that it took so long.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6845" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JapaneseFishingGhostVessel.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/JapaneseFishingGhostVessel-e1335309130851.jpg" alt="Japanese Ghost Ship, Ryou-Un Maru Floats Near British Columbia before Coast Guard Scuttles Her" title="JapaneseFishingGhostVessel" width="325" height="206" class="size-full wp-image-6845" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Japanese Ghost Ship, Ryou-Un Maru Floats Near British Columbia before Coast Guard Scuttles Her</p></div> A derelict Japanese fishing vessel drifted at least 4,500 miles before it was spotted off the coast of Canada and sunk by the U.S. Coast Guard in early April.</p>
<p>During a spring trip to Craig, Alaska, Ebbesmeyer taught kids how to spot Japanese tsunami debris, how to use a geiger counter and even asked them for solutions to get rid of the refuse.</p>
<p>So far he says hundreds if not thousands of four-foot black styrofoam buoys have washed ashore &#8212; mostly from oyster farms off the coast of Japan. They are appearing, pretty much all at once, Ebbesmeyer says, from Kodiak, Alaska all the way to northern California.</p>
<p>He tells <a href="http://kuow.org/program.php?id=26430">KUOW&#8217;s Weekday</a> says, &#8220;When you have a disaster like a container spill the debris comes ashore all at once and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve seen since last October.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Ebbesmeyer says he&#8217;s expecting more to wash ashore, including refrigerators, cameras and boats. But so far there&#8217;s only been the one squid, which the U.S. Coast Guard sank in deep water near the Queen Charlotte Islands. </p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Refrigerators float because the insulation around the outside is styrofoam.&#8221; A couple of years ago Ebbesmeyer tracked a container spill of little refrigerators which washed ashore months later. So he knows that they float quite well. </p>
<p>The Coast Guard says the Japanese ghost ship was floating in shipping lanes and posed a risk as an unmanned, unmarked, unlit vessel. Therefore it had to be sunk, despite the fact that it was still carrying diesel fuel on board.</p>
<p>Ebbesmeyer says that we are woefully unprepared for the Japanese tsunami debris and that the decision to sink the 200-foot boat shows that.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;We&#8217;re in reactionary mode when things show up and we react but we don&#8217;t have time to plan.&#8221; <div id="attachment_6850" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 263px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TsunamiDebrisArrivesinWA-e1335309413683.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TsunamiDebrisArrivesinWA-e1335309413683.jpg" alt="3 Japanese Buoy Types Washing Ashore from Oregon to Alaska, Photo by John Ingraham" title="TsunamiDebrisArrivesinWA" width="253" height="275" class="size-full wp-image-6850" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">3 Japanese Buoy Types Washing Ashore from Oregon to Alaska, Photo by John Ingraham</p></div></p>
<p>The debris began arriving last October in what Ebbesmeyer says was the wake-up call. Now, he says, this boat has given us another wake-up call. He says, &#8220;I think we are going to be driven by more and more events of different things washing up until the main event starts maybe this fall in October.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says that&#8217;s when we are going to see a lot of flotsam washing ashore up and down the U.S. west coast from Alaska to California. Right now, Ebbesmeyer says we are &#8220;behind the curve&#8221; and need to get ahead of it.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6846" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TsunamiSoccerBall.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TsunamiSoccerBall-e1335309551868.jpg" alt="The Soccer Ball with Japanese Writing, &quot;Hang in There, Murakami!!&quot; Came from a School in the Tsunami Zone Washed up on An Alaskan Island.

Photo by David Baxter.</p></div>Last week a soccer ball and volleyball rolled ashore in a remote Alaska island used primarily as a radar station. The soccer ball has Japanese writing stenciled on it and allowed radar technician David Baxter and wife Yumi to translate and identify the school where the ball came from in Japan. The school is located in the tsunami zone but is up a hill and didn&#8217;t sustain much damage.</p>
<p>NOAA spokesman Doug Helton says he is working with the U.S. State Department and Japanese officials to return the two items.</p>
<p>He tells the <a href="http://www.adn.com/2012/04/20/2433870/sports-gear-may-be-first-of-tsunami.html">Anchorage Daily News</a>, &#8220;There have been other items that were suspected, but this is the first one that we&#8217;re aware of that has the credentials that may make it possible to positively identify it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Baxter and his wife are in the process of returning the soccer ball to 16 year-old Misaki Murakami and the volleyball to 19 year-old Shiori Sato. According to a <a href="http://usresponserestoration.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/japanese-soccer-ball-lost-during-tsunami-washes-up-in-alaska/">NOAA update</a> Murakami received the ball in 2005 as a gift from his classmates in third grade before moving to a new elementary school. He lost everything in the 2011 Japan tsunami and is grateful that this sentimental object has been located. The NOAA update also says that Sato&#8217;s house washed away during the March 11, 2011 tsunami.</p>
<p>Helton says that a new computer model released earlier this month puts Alaska as one of the first stops for tsunami debris from Japan. He says, &#8220;You can see that the Gulf of Alaska is going to get high windage items, floats, Styrofoam, soccer balls. Those things could be moving pretty quickly. Wood and construction materials will be a lot slower.&#8221; </p>
<p>In a late March post on his blog <a href="http://beachcombersalert.blogspot.com/">Beachcomber&#8217;s Alert</a> Ebbesmeyer began tracking the 170-foot squid boat <em>Ryou-Un Maru</em>. Using the <a href="http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/REFM/docs/oscurs/get_to_know.htm">OSCURS computer model</a> which his oceanographer friend <a href="http://www.pathsacrossthepacific.org/james-ingraham.html">Jim Ingraham</a> built, the two tracked the ship&#8217;s path using wind speed and ocean currents. </p>
<div id="attachment_6851" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 570px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/RyouUnMaruDriftMap.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/RyouUnMaruDriftMap-e1335310110368.jpg" alt="OSCURS Model Maps Path of Ryou-Un Maru Japanese Ghost Ship" title="RyouUnMaruDriftMap" width="560" height="312" class="size-full wp-image-6851" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">OSCURS Model Maps Path of Ryou-Un Maru Japanese Ghost Ship, courtesy of Jim Ingraham, Driftbusters, Inc.</p></div>
<p>They wanted to see where the vessel would eventually make landfall, somewhere near the northern tip of British Columbia. As it turns out, the Coast Guard scuttled the ship about 150 miles south of Alaska.</p>
<p>Ebbesmeyer thinks that Japanese tsunami debris in coming months and years is going to overwhelm beach clean up efforts because it&#8217;ll just be too much stuff. After talking with middle and high school students in Alaska he&#8217;s decided that beachside rock pits that commonly dot the coastline there could be a good place to store the debris as it washes ashore before it can be sorted and recycled or returned.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;There will be mementos that the Japanese will want to come over and retrieve themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the rest he says needs to be removed from beaches and &#8220;sequestered so we can sort it judiciously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on running the OSCURS model for the last 30 years, a lot of experience with flotsam and the wind factor, Ebbesmeyer says that the U.S. west coast is going to be getting a big pile of Japanese debris sometime around October. Based on ocean currents the coast of Washington and Vancouver Island could receive up to 90 percent of the debris that&#8217;s on its way.</p>

<p>A minivan-sized meteorite woke many California and Nevada residents yesterday morning as it streaked across the sky, probably less than five miles above Earth. The low altitude and high speed aligned to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_boom">sonic boom</a>, which occurs when an object travels faster than the speed of sound and the pressure waves before and after an object get compressed, merging into one sound shock wave at the speed of sound, also known as mach 1 (761 mph.)</p>
<p>Residents from Reno to Las Vegas and from San Francisco to Sacramento all heard, felt and saw the same thing &#8212; a fireball racing across the low horizon accompanied by a loud explosion. <div id="attachment_6827" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NevadaMeteorite.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NevadaMeteorite-e1335205935897.jpg" alt="Map of Sightings of Sunday&#039;s Supersonic Meteorite" title="NevadaMeteorite" width="325" height="226" class="size-full wp-image-6827" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Map of Sightings of Sunday&#039;s Supersonic Meteorite</p></div></p>
<p>Many people hopped out of bed thinking they were experiencing an earthquake. Some thought a car had hit their homes. But it was a 12-foot solid piece of space rock racing through the atmosphere and burning up as it shrieked across the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Small chunks of the meteorite probably hit the ground, according to astronomers.</p>
<p>Meteor physicist <a href="http://astro.uwo.ca/~esilber/">Elizabeth Silber</a> at Western University in Ontario, Canada tracks fireball events. She followed Sunday&#8217;s supersonic meteorite using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound">infrasound</a>, which allowed her to triangulate the location of the <a href="http://woodshole.er.usgs.gov/epubs/bolide/introduction.html">bolide</a>, high in the California mountains.</p>
<p>Meteors generate <a href="http://meteor.uwo.ca/research/infrasound/is_whatisIS.html">infrasound </a>waves, which appear at the frequency below 20Hz, the range of human hearing. Animals such as whales, dolphins, elephants and giraffes use infrasound to communicate with each other across long distances because the infrasound waves travel far without losing signal quality. Avalanches, ocean waves, waterfalls and earthquakes also create infrasound, which scientists like Silber can track.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6829" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/source-of-infrasound.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/source-of-infrasound-e1335206233896.jpg" alt="Natural and Manmade Infrasound, courtesy of Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization" title="source of infrasound" width="325" height="198" class="size-full wp-image-6829" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Natural and Manmade Infrasound, courtesy of Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization</p></div>Bill Cooke at NASA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/meo/home/aboutMEO-rd.html">Meteoroid Environment Office</a> quickly decoded the mysterious morning event that had whole towns talking. He tells <a href="http://www.spaceweather.com/">SpaceWeather.com</a>, &#8220;The fact that sonic booms were heard indicates that this meteor penetrated very low in atmosphere, which implies a speed less than 15 km/s (33,500 mph). Assuming this value for the speed, I get a mass for the meteor of around 70 metric tons. Hazarding a further guess at the density of 3 grams per cubic centimeter (solid rock), I calculate a size of about 3-4 meters, or about the size of a minivan.&#8221;</p>
<p>He thinks that the space rock was a sporadic meteor and not a fragment from a comet (a much rarer event). The Earth is passing through the tail debris field of the comet Thatcher and dust to pea-sized chunks of the comet have been making spectacular nighttime viewing during the annual Lyrid meteor shower, which was just winding down when the unusual meteor disrupted a quiet Sunday.</p>
<p>Cooke says this was a big event and the comet packed quite a punch which caused the sonic boom. He says, &#8220;The energy is estimated at a whopping 3.8 kilotons of TNT &#8212; about one fourth the energy of the [atomic] bomb dropped on Hiroshima.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was enough for Silber to detect from Canada and it roused Reno resident Nicole Carlsen. She tells the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/explosion-heard-in-nevada-california-was-likely-caused-by-meteor-astronomers-say/2012/04/22/gIQAZczXaT_story.html">Associated Press</a>, &#8220;I kept looking for earthquake information, but (there was) nothing. I even checked the front of my house to make sure no one ran into the garage. I wish I had seen the meteor.&#8221; <div id="attachment_6832" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NevadaMeteoriteSky.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NevadaMeteoriteSky-e1335206940398.jpg" alt="Bright Fireball Zips across Cloudless Morning Sky in Nevada, courtesy of KTVN viewer Lisa Warren" title="NevadaMeteoriteSky" width="325" height="215" class="size-full wp-image-6832" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Bright Fireball Zips across Cloudless Morning Sky in Nevada, courtesy of KTVN viewer Lisa Warren</p></div></p>
<p>Many people in a 600-mile range thought the sonic boom was actually an earthquake but the U.S. Geological Survey didn&#8217;t report any quakes in the area at the time. The American Meteor Society says it was a fireball, which is an extremely bright meteor. Member and man who wrote the book on observing meteors Robert Lunsford says, &#8220;It happens all the time, but most are in daytime and are missed. This one was extraordinarily bright in the daylight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says most fireballs are visible at about 50 miles above the ground but a sonic boom won&#8217;t occur unless the meteor breaks up pretty close to Earth, like about five miles.</p>
<p>Lunsford says, &#8220;If you hear a sonic boom or loud explosion, that’s a good indication that some fragments may have reached the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>While somewhat rare, the AMS has logged over 2,000 reports of nine <a href="http://www.amsmeteors.org/category/fireball-sightings/">fireball events</a> so far this year.</p>
<p>Now the search begins for meteorite fragments. Could be a job (and episode) for the <a href="http://www.meteoriteadventures.com/">Meteorite Men</a>, Geoff Notkin and Steve Arnold.</p>
<p>If you find a fragment of this meteor, please let REALscience know, too! Happy hunting.</p>

<p>Rise and Mobilize on April 22, the 42nd Earth Day.</p>
<p>The international theme of Earth Day this year is <a href="http://www.earthday.org/2012">Mobilize the Earth</a>. After last year&#8217;s call for one billion acts of green, the environmental movement is trying to put all of those individual good deeds into a global push for environmental sustainability, reduction of waste, climate policy and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>To mark the green occasion the environmental arm of Disney &#8212; called <a href="http://disney.go.com/disneynature/chimpanzee/">DisneyNature</a> &#8212; is releasing its fourth Earth-centric feature film today. In partnership with the <a href="http://www.janegoodall.org/chimpanzee-movie">Jane Goodall Institute</a>, <em>Chimpanzee </em>tells the story of orphaned chimp Oscar who finds himself alone in the African jungle until a male chimp Freddie adopts him. </p>
<p>Like the other DisneyNature films a portion of the opening week&#8217;s proceeds will be donated to charity &#8212; this time the Goodall Institute&#8217;s Chimpanzee work. $.20 from every Chimpanzee ticket sold between April 20 and 26 will go toward habitat restoration, education and other chimp-related programs as part of the Disneynature Tchimpounga Nature Reserve Project.</p>
<p>Previous efforts by Disney included partnering with the Nature Conservancy to <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/culture/disneynature-makes-good-on-tree-planting-idea-by-partnering-with-nature-conservancy.html">plant trees</a> and to <a href="http://corporate.disney.go.com/citizenship/20100429-tnc_coralreef.html">preserve coral reefs</a>. DisneyNature also partnered with African Wildlife Foundation to ensure the <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/corporate-responsibility/disneynatures-african-cats-helps-save-the-savanna-on-earth-day.html">future of lions</a>, cheetahs, and other animals on the African savanna.</p>
<p>Each of these films has debuted just before Earth Day, a global day of celebration and appreciation for the planet on which we all live.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to turn out for the national Earth Day celebration in Washington D.C. on Sunday. Among the entertainers will be Cheap Trick, Dave Mason (frontman for Traffic), Kicking Daisies, Explorers Club as well as numerous political and environmental activists, including Denis Hayes the founder of Earth Day.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6801" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/denishayes.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/denishayes-e1334946377236.jpg" alt="Denis Hayes, Earth Day Founder and CEO of the Bullitt Foundation" title="denishayes" width="325" height="254" class="size-full wp-image-6801" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Denis Hayes, Earth Day Founder and CEO of the Bullitt Foundation</p></div>Hayes leads the largest environmental non-profits in the Pacific Northwest. And as CEO of the <a href="http://bullitt.org/">Bullitt Foundation</a> he is busy overseeing the construction of the uber-green building that will house the organization. If all goes according to plan when finished the building will generate its own water and electricity, meeting the top qualification for greeness &#8212; a LEED Platinum certification.</p>
<p>He considers Earth Day to be a gateway drug to environmentalism. And he hopes it&#8217;s one on which everyone gets hooked. As the honorary chair of the global <a href="http://www.earthday.org/about-earth-day-network">Earth Day Network</a> he says, &#8220;We need a shot in the arm. We’ve been pretty disappointed with the environmental movement’s failure to capitalize on things that have gone wrong – the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the nuclear meltdown in Fukushima. These things were all over the headlines, and yet what new policies have they led to?&#8221;</p>
<p>But they are only a handful of issues the world faces this Earth Day. Fortunately, there are tens of thousands of events around the world highlighting the problem and millions of ways to make a difference. This Earth Day think about Arctic ice melting, wildlife disappearing, deforestation, oil spills, air pollution and contaminated water.</p>
<p>Earth Day is a moment when people can tell their elected leaders what they want for a better environment. This year that list includes, renewable energy, improved energy efficiency, green jobs, clean air and a healthy environment for our families.</p>
<p>The Earth Day Network is encouraging a billion acts of green to show how serious people are about improving and preserving the environment for generations to come. And that&#8217;s why in the Earth Day trailer, activists say, &#8220;We are going to show our leaders that we are tired of waiting by inspiring a billion acts of green.&#8221;</p>
<p>Whether it is turning off the lights when they aren&#8217;t in use, organize a tree planting or bike to work, your actions can tell the world how you are pitching in on Earth Day. Everyday is Earth day but April 22 is just an annual reminder to focus on our precious planet.<div id="attachment_6810" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/McClainSistersChimpanzee.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/McClainSistersChimpanzee-e1334947302558.jpg" alt="McClain Sisters (China, Lauryn and Sierra) at Chimpanzee Premier" title="McClainSistersChimpanzee" width="325" height="217" class="size-full wp-image-6810" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">McClain Sisters (China, Lauryn and Sierra) at Chimpanzee Premier</p></div></p>
<p>Three teen sisters, China, Lauryn and Sierra make up the pop trio McClain Sisters. Their song Rise is featured in the DisneyNature film <em>Chimpanzee</em>. They are the spokesteens for Disney&#8217;s community and environmental program <a href="http://disney.go.com/projectgreen/aboutffc.html">Friends for Change</a>, which inspires kids to make change, to rise above their circumstances and improve their communities. Those are also themes from <em>Chimpanzee</em>.</p>
<p>Talking over each other at the Orlando premier of the movie, the sisters say, &#8220;And, um, since Friends for Change, we’ve started recycling and turning water off [OVERLAP] — Turning the water off. Exactly, exactly. And lights. Exactly. Stuff like that, so it’s really changed our lives, and we were really excited.&#8221;</p>
<p>After seeing very early scenes from <em>Chimpanzee</em>, the sisters created Rise to capture the resilience of one little chimp and ability of a new family of chimps to band together to protect their land from a gang of rivals.</p>
<p>Sierra McClain says, &#8220;It’s uplifting, you know, and it’s spiritual and that was a big thing for the movie, you know, how they all had to stick together if they wanted to survive, you know, they had to be together.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><h3>Rise</h3>
<p>By: McClain Sisters (Disney Friends for Change)</p>
<p>I used to be afraid of giving up<br />
The road was just too tough<br />
Out here on my own<br />
My path was so alone</p>
<p>But now I see clearly<br />
Everything within me<br />
Is reaching out to the sky<br />
I can see the world with open eyes</p>
<p>You can’t let it pass you<br />
Just take hold and grasp it<br />
Now’s the time to take a chance<br />
With the strength of a thousand men<br />
Climbing to my feet again</p>
<p>So dry those tears from your eyes<br />
And everything will be alright<br />
You know the rainbow’s just in sight<br />
Dust your wings off as you rise<br />
If your heart feels overwhelmed<br />
Just know you’re never by yourself<br />
Put your hands in mine, hold your head up high<br />
And together we’ll rise</p>
<p>That’s what left your head up to the sky<br />
And find yourself asking why?<br />
Never see them out at night<br />
With the hardships of life</p>
<p>But faith is where my heart is<br />
Let energy replace my doubts<br />
Won’t my trials get the best of me<br />
I’m marching forward towards my destiny</p>
<p>You can’t let it pass you<br />
Just take hold and grasp it<br />
Now’s the time to take a chance<br />
With the strength of a thousand men<br />
Climbing to my feet again</p>
<p>So dry those tears from your eyes<br />
And everything will be alright<br />
You know the rainbow’s just in sight<br />
Dust your wings off as you rise<br />
If your heart feels overwhelmed<br />
Just know you’re never by yourself<br />
Put your hands in mine, hold your head up high<br />
And together we’ll rise</p>
<p>Together we can do anything<br />
We’ll rise<br />
We can make it through anything<br />
We’ll rise<br />
Together we can do anything<br />
We’ll rise, we’ll rise, we’ll rise</p>
<p>You can try to hurt me, doubt me and desert me<br />
I feel the will of kings, with my mind I’ll build the sea<br />
And you know a tree will grow and take me in<br />
To safety’s arms, I will descend</p>
<p>So dry those tears from your eyes<br />
And everything will be alright<br />
You know the rainbow’s just in sight<br />
Dust your wings off as you rise<br />
If your heart feels overwhelmed<br />
Just know you’re never by yourself<br />
Put your hands in mine, hold your head up high<br />
And together we’ll rise</p>
<p>Together we can do anything<br />
We’ll rise<br />
We can make it through anything<br />
We’ll rise<br />
Together we can do anything<br />
We’ll rise, we’ll rise, we’ll rise</p>
<p>Together we can do anything<br />
We’ll rise<br />
We can make it through anything<br />
We’ll rise<br />
Together we can do anything<br />
We’ll rise, we’ll rise, we’ll rise</p>

<p>Known as the father of Microsoft Word and Excel, billionaire tech titan <a href="http://www.simonyifund.org/charlessimonyi.asp">Charles Simonyi</a> has been to space twice, spending two two-week stints aboard the International Space Station. The high-profile astronaut is a neighbor of Bill Gates just outside of Seattle who recently donated $3 million to outfit the nearby Museum of Flight with his Russian orbital capsule which is housed in the new <a href="http://www.museumofflight.org/exhibits/future-spaceflight-exhibit-and-gallery-preview">Charles Simonyi Space Gallery</a>.<div id="attachment_6784" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CharlesSimonyiSpace.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CharlesSimonyiSpace-e1334856883979.jpg" alt="Charles Simonyi Practices Superman Move in Preparation for His First Space Trip, 2006" title="CharlesSimonyiSpace" width="325" height="246" class="size-full wp-image-6784" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charles Simonyi Practices Superman Move in Zero-Gravity Preparation for His First Space Trip, 2006</p></div></p>
<p>Right now, he is touring the country talking about the cultural place of science in society. To do that he is promoting the published work of his father, Hungarian physicist <a href="http://www.omikk.bme.hu/archivum/angol/htm/simonyi_k.htm">Károly Simonyi</a>. The elder Simonyi published <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cultural-History-Physics-K%C3%A1roly-Simonyi/dp/1568813295">A Cultural History of Physics</a></em> in his native language in 1979. Since then it has been updated five times and now thanks to his son, the work is being published in English and released in the U.S. for the first time. The younger Simonyi shows that he is more than his wealth, his education and his accomplishments. He is also a good son.</p>
<p>The book chronicles 4,000 years of physics from the Ancient Greeks to the to the end of the 20th Century. The new English &#8220;world book&#8221; edition features an introduction by physicist <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~dyson/">Freeman Dyson</a>, a foreword by Charles Simonyi and an epilogue by physicist <a href="http://www.sns.ias.edu/~witten/">Ed Witten</a> (who brings the story from the year 2000 to the present.) </p>
<p>Charles Simonyi tells <a href="http://www.space.com/15225-charles-simonyi-space-tourist-book.html">Space.com</a>, &#8220;It&#8217;s an extraordinary book because it&#8217;s written for everyone who is interested in culture either from the humanities side or from the science side.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6785" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ACulturalHistoryofPhysics.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/ACulturalHistoryofPhysics-e1334856927732.jpg" alt="A Cultural History of Physics by Karoly Simonyi Reaches English-Speaking World Thanks to Son Charles" title="ACulturalHistoryofPhysics" width="325" height="325" class="size-full wp-image-6785" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Cultural History of Physics by Karoly Simonyi Reaches English-Speaking World Thanks to Son Charles</p></div>Simonyi says his father always kept an incredible library of books and was well versed in both the humanities and the sciences. He says of his father, &#8220;He always professed that culture is an integral whole; the humanities and the sciences are indivisible and they should be understood together.&#8221;</p>
<p>After being forced to step down as director at the Hungarian Physics Research Institute for political reasons in the 1960s Károly Simonyi decided to write a book which helps to bridge two seemingly diametrically opposing cultures &#8212; the humanities and science.</p>
<p>Science historian C.P. Snow defined the idea of <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=an-update-on-cp-snows-two-cultures">Two Cultures</a>. And other scientific historians have attempted to explore the societal divide between them.</p>
<p>The proud son Simonyi says, &#8220;I think science, of course, is very important for everyone to understand — if not the details of science, the role of science in society and how science relates to the rest of our lives and the rest of our pursuits.&#8221; And what could be a better way to learn about the connection of science and the humanities he says than through the familiar lens of history.</p>
<p>American physicist Freeman Dyson writes the introduction of the book. He calls Károly Simonyi&#8217;s masterwork &#8220;a grand monument to the life of its author&#8221; whom he says was a teacher first, a scholar second and a scientist third.<div id="attachment_6786" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CharlesSimonyiBookopen.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/CharlesSimonyiBookopen-e1334857062388.jpg" alt="Charles Simonyi Poses with His Father&#039;s Book Next to His Old Spacesuit" title="CharlesSimonyiBookopen" width="325" height="216" class="size-full wp-image-6786" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Charles Simonyi Poses with His Father&#039;s Book Next to His Old Spacesuit</p></div></p>
<p>Son Charles penned the book&#8217;s foreword. In it he says, &#8220;In the politically charged atmosphere of the 1960s in Hungary, his quasi-apolitical personal conduct, based on the age-old virtues of hard work, good character, and charity, was interpreted as political defiance that could not be countenanced by the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>At age 17 in another act of political defiance, Charles left Hungary and his parents for the U.S. in search of a better life. At the time and perhaps prophetically the man who would become the only civilian to visit the International Space Station twice knew only two English words, &#8220;propellant&#8221; and &#8220;nozzle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Simonyi says the book captures his father&#8217;s sense of humor. It even features 17th Century gossip among heavy hitters in science, including an apparent exchange between Sir Isaac Newton and Leibniz.</p>
<blockquote><p>Newton: He [Leibniz] uses hypotheses rather than arguments resulting from experimentation, accuses me of opinions that I do not hold, and instead of asking questions that should be answered by experiment before they are granted entrance into philosophy, proposes hypotheses that should be accepted and believed before they are examined.</p>
<p>Leibniz: After I was told that Newton had said something unusual about God in the Latin version of his Opticks, I had a look at it and had to laugh over the idea that space is the sensorium of God—as though God, the source of all things, had need of a sensorium. … In metaphysics, this man, it would seem, is not very successful.</p></blockquote>
<p>Diagrams throughout the book taken from non-Western philosophers exemplify Károly Simonyi&#8217;s position that science needs the humanities and that between the two cultures lies an exciting interplay of ideas, emotion and insight about life. </p>
<p>The tome is filled with obscure and illuminating quotations from the great scientific masters, including one from German physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Planck">Max Planck</a> taken from his autobiography.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;My original decision to devote myself to science was a direct result of the discovery which has never ceased to fill me with enthusiasm since my early youth—the comprehension of the far from obvious fact that the laws of human reasoning coincide with the laws governing the sequences of the impressions we receive from the world about us; that, therefore, pure reasoning can enable man to gain an insight into the mechanism of the latter. In this connection, it is of paramount importance that the outside world is something independent from man, something absolute, and the quest for the laws which apply to this absolute appeared to me as the most sublime scientific pursuit of life.&#8221; &#8212; Max Planck, <em>Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Dyson remembers visiting the elder Simonyi in Budapest once where he saw the man&#8217;s tattered and bullet-riddled books. There a highlight for him was catching a glimpse the German version of the book now available in English. Of that experience, he says, &#8220;I had only a few minutes to explore the beauties of this work, but I recognized it at once as a unique and magnificent achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Simonyi pays tribute by fulfilling his father&#8217;s dream of having <em>A Cultural History of Physics</em> published in English. Now Dyson and others have all the time in the world to dive into the misunderstood chasm that lies between science and the humanities.</p>

<p>Self-deprecating astronomer <a href="http://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/astro/people/ChrisLintott.htm">Chris Lintott</a> is terribly British. From his post at University of Oxford he keeps tabs on the universe and everything in it. He says, &#8220;This is a problem because the universe is very big and reasonably complicated and I am very small and reasonably stupid.&#8221; <div id="attachment_6769" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/chrislintott3.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/chrislintott3.jpg" alt="Chris Lintott, Astronomer and Galactic Zookeeper " title="chrislintott3" width="250" height="263" class="size-full wp-image-6769" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chris Lintott, Astronomer and Galactic Zookeeper </p></div></p>
<p>Before a crowd of London pub-dwellers recently Lintott who is the brain behind <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse</a>, an online portal for citizen science, admitted getting lost on the way to the Lost Lectures, a bit of irony not lost on him.</p>
<p>As is commonly understood the universe expanding and that expansion is even speeding up. To that Lintott quips, &#8220;So there is more stuff that I don&#8217;t understand each and every second.&#8221; That&#8217;s why he needs everyone&#8217;s help to unravel a few scientific mysteries.</p>
<p>Lintott is traveling the world telling the story of Zooniverse, raising awareness and excitement about citizen science initiatives and projects. And he is pointing out that we are living in a unique period of human history.</p>
<p>For thousands of years our understanding of the universe has been limited to what we could see with our eyes, brains and telescopes. But now we can process much more data than ever before with distributed networks, supercomputers and citizen scientists.</p>
<p>Now astronomy finds itself in a reverse conundrum where there is a vast shortage of astronomers to analyze an accelerating and growing amount of data.</p>
<p>In just a couple of years Zooniverse has become a leading citizen science portal with over 600,000 people from all over the world helping astronomers better understand the universe. But why turn to the public?</p>
<p>Lintott says, &#8220;We had one of those everyday problems &#8212; too many galaxies.&#8221; The <a href="http://www.sdss.org/">Sloan Digital Sky Survey</a> in New Mexico captured images of a million galaxies. And each of those galaxies has a hundred billion stars. And now astronomers believe there is at least one planet orbiting each of those stars. That&#8217;s a lot of information available just waiting to be studied.</p>
<p>Before turning to the public, Lintott tells the crowd he did what any self-respecting scientist would do to classify the million galaxies. He got a student named Kevin to work on it. But after a mere 50,000 galaxies the Kevin sat Lintott down at the Royal Oak pub in Oxford where he announced he couldn&#8217;t look at all one million galaxies on his own.</p>
<p>Lintott put a call for help since this was a project for people not computers. And with literally a million images to sift through this task called for an army of citizen scientists.</p>
<p>A few years later, Zooniverse was born. And then Lintott faced another problem &#8212; coping with the hordes of people who wanted to help with the research. At the same time other researchers began calling saying they had too much data as well.</p>
<p>Now the Zooniverse includes <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects">projects </a>on climate, archiving ancient papyrus texts, classifying galaxies, identifying icy Kuiper Belt objects and even planet hunting.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6770" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/zooniverse7.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/zooniverse7-e1334782903184.jpg" alt="A Few Projects from Zooniverse.org" title="zooniverse[7]" width="325" height="179" class="size-full wp-image-6770" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">A Few Projects from Zooniverse.org</p></div>He says, &#8220;We&#8217;ve built a suite of projects to allow people to make a meaningful difference to science.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the first planet orbiting a star outside our solar system was discovered it was an exciting moment and at the time thought to be a rare occasion &#8212; like spotting a super nova mid implosion. But 16 years later the <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">Kepler Space Telescope</a> is sending back so much information after staring day in and day out at the same patch of sky with 150,000 stars that astronomers need the public&#8217;s help to comb through all the information and images.</p>
<p>Using a process called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_extrasolar_planets#Transit_method">transit method</a> to find new planets orbiting distant stars can be accomplished with precise instruments and computers but the public seems to do a better job.</p>
<p>Lintott says, &#8220;Computers find some of them but with the help of the public we&#8217;d like to find the weird and the strange ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last year, citizen science <a href="http://blog.planethunters.org/2011/09/16/tatooine-discovered-by-kepler/">planet hunters</a> found a world orbiting a double star. Lintott compares it to the fictional Star Wars planet Tatooine and cites it as a stellar example of weird planets that are out there waiting to be found. Zooniversers also found an odd galaxy. <div id="attachment_6772" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HannysVoorwerp.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/HannysVoorwerp-e1334783217953.jpg" alt="Hanny&#039;s Voorwerp, a Super-Heated Gas Cloud near a Black Hole, Discovered by Zooniverse Volunteer Hanny van Arkel" title="HannysVoorwerp" width="275" height="308" class="size-full wp-image-6772" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hanny&#039;s Voorwerp, a Super-Heated Gas Cloud near a Black Hole, Discovered by Zooniverse Volunteer Hanny van Arkel</p></div></p>
<p>A Dutch school teacher found a super-heated and galaxy-sized gas cloud on one of the galaxy images. She tagged it as unusual and that caught the attention of astronomers who discovered that it is a real-life example of something that was only theorized.</p>
<p>Called a thingy in Dutch, Lintott says <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanny%27s_Voorwerp">Hanny&#8217;s Voorwerp </a>looks like a space ship or Kermit the Frog, depending how you squint at it. </p>
<p>Lintott says, &#8220;The Voorwerp is a cloud of gas that just got in the way and got heated up (to 50,000 degrees) and it may even be forming stars as the result &#8212; very odd.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it wouldn&#8217;t have been spotted by a computer because no one knew it existed in order to tell the computer to look for it. Computers can give predictable results but in exploration and research like astronomy what isn&#8217;t known is just as valuable or more so than what it.</p>
<p>That makes citizen scientists indispensable to the science process involving big amounts of data.</p>
<p>Now that Zooniverse and other citizen science portals have broken down the barrier which has left science to the experts in universities, Lintott is hoping to let the citizens drive the research by asking relevant questions and having the scientists follow along helping out with the process.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Once we see people are empowered to do that they start leading their own projects; they have their own research questions.&#8221; He says that the citizen scientists become passionate defenders who are doing their own research with our help on the things they care about.</p>
<p>Then citizens not research councils begin to drive the science agenda. And that really excites Lintott.</p>
<p>To participate in citizen science project you need to be able to recognize patterns. So Lintott says you should be about 6 or older to join a citizen science project. You just need spare time, a willingness to help and a web browser.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6774" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shesanastronomerpics.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/shesanastronomerpics-e1334783951676.jpg" alt="Zooniverse Volunteers Help Make Science History" title="shesanastronomerpics" width="325" height="243" class="size-full wp-image-6774" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Zooniverse Volunteers Help Make Science History</p></div>Zooniverse has a partnership with the Chicago school district to motivate students to get excited about current science research, a far cry from the dull science lessons of Lintott&#8217;s youth.</p>
<p>Lintott still wants to know why galaxies act the way the do. He says, &#8220;It&#8217;s a beautifully messy problem and we&#8217;re just getting to the point where we can look at millions of galaxies and with the help of our volunteers we can unpick the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Galaxy Zoo, the oldest of the Zooniverse projects has spawned <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/published_papers">28 scientific papers</a> and has contributed to the knowledge base of galactic astronomy. Zooniverse is also working with SETI to search for signals from extraterrestrial civilizations and to study solar storms as they erupt from the sun.</p>
<p>Lintott says, &#8220;It&#8217;s all visual information using pattern recognition software that&#8217;s already running between your ears to do real science.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fifty years ago the biggest problem facing science was getting enough information. Since then scientists have become very good about collecting information about the world and the universe. And in a networked world electronics are cheap cameras are cheap. Lintott says, &#8220;That&#8217;s easy&#8221; But he adds, &#8220;The hard bit is processing the stuff and having enough eyes to do that. So that&#8217;s why we&#8217;re asking for everybody&#8217;s help.&#8221;</p>

But their findings were clouded in controversy. For over 35 years the two persistent scientists have maintained that they found evidence of biological life on Mars. But many other scientists believe that a superoxide in the Martian soil gave the appearance of microbial life when none was actually present.</p>
<p>NASA has only ever searched for extraterrestrial life during one mission. The three experiments took place in 1976 during the Viking lander missions on Mars. And according to a <a href="http://ijass.org/On_line/admin/files/2%29%28014-026%2911-030.pdf">new paper</a> (PDF) published in the journal <em>International Journal of Aeronautical and Space Sciences</em> scientists found life but discounted it for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Of the three experiments performed on Martian soil only the Labeled Release experiment obtained a clearly positive response, according to new research. The paper says, &#8220;Labeled Release (LR) experiment of Levin and Straat [1-4] satisfied a stringent set of prior agreed upon criteria for the detection of microbial life on Mars (i.e. a significant increase in evolved radioactive carbon-containing gas over baseline after 14C radiolabeled nutrient administration to a Mars soil sample.&#8221;</p>
<p>After applying a chemical cocktail that would react with any biological form in the soil, Levin and Straat (who are co-authors on the new paper) say there was a gas release, indicating they had found microbial life.</p>
<p>But those results became controversial because some scientists believed the samples were contaminated by a mysterious agent in the planet&#8217;s soil, giving a false result. For decades researchers studied the chemistry of that experiment.</p>
<p>Now an international group of scientists, including two who were involved in the original LR experiment, conducted a new kind of mathematical analysis using complexity and came up with the same result. There is microbial life on Mars.</p>
<p>But critics remain doubtful.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6759" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MarsVikingLanderBiologicalPackage.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MarsVikingLanderBiologicalPackage-e1334708733829.png" alt="Schematic of Mars Viking Lander Life Detection Equipment" title="MarsVikingLanderBiologicalPackage" width="325" height="306" class="size-full wp-image-6759" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Schematic of Mars Viking Lander Life Detection Equipment</p></div>In the paper, USC neurobiologist <a href="http://www.usc.edu/hsc/info/pr/hmm/02winter/benchmarks.html">Joe Miller</a> and Italian biomedicine and astrobiology researcher Giorgio Bianciardi join original LR experiment scientists Straat and Levin to show that the numbers point to Martian life.</p>
<p>Miller tells REALscience the paper looked at the numeric complexity of biological and non-biological data sets and found that the LR experiments &#8220;generated data that were much more complex than the controls.&#8221;</p>
<p>To do their complexity study the team took the LR data from Mars and then added both known terrestrial biological and non-biological data series to see how they compared. By doing a cluster analysis they found that the active LR data naturally sorted with known biological samples and the control LR data (from heat-sterilized soil) naturally sorted with non-biological data.</p>
<p>Miller says those results are highly significant. He says, &#8220;You can see that the two data types, biolgoical v. non-biological are almost mirror images of each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not enough to appease the critics who say that the study didn&#8217;t use enough different types of biological and non-biological data to validate the procedure.</p>
<p>To that Miller says, &#8220;Our critics say it would have been best to look at say, 30 examples of biological and non-biological measures on Earth.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Sure, no argument. But the thing they are missing is that we got highly significant differences even with a modest data set.&#8221;</p>
<p>Biological systems are highly ordered but non-biological processes are fairly random. Think of biological systems as the signal while non-biological processes are the white noise. To tease out the signal from the noise biological systems exhibit patterns over time.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComplexityTheory.html">complexity theory</a>, Miller and his astrobiological cohorts employed seven complexity variables, all derived from LR data, to show that Viking LR active responses can be distinguished from controls via cluster analysis and other multivariate math techniques.</p>
<p>The paper says, &#8220;These measures very strongly suggest, in agreement with terrestrial analyses, that the active LR experiments in all likelihood detected microbial life on Mars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miller reiterates, &#8220;The obvious hypothesis is that the active LR experiments were looking at some type of microbial life.&#8221;</p>
<p>To do the complexity analysis, the team used a data series of rat core temperatures taken every minute over a 23-day period for a biological comparison. They also compared the complexity of the Viking lander LR experiments samples to soil samples with known Earthly microbes. Then they added non-biological data to the analysis, including Mars background radiation, Mars atmospheric temperature, temperature readings from the Viking lander, and data from a terrestrial heat-sterilized soil sample.</p>
<div id="attachment_6761" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 570px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MarsVikingLabeledReleaseExperiment.gif"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MarsVikingLabeledReleaseExperiment-e1334709130281.gif" alt="Viking Lander During Labeled Release Experiment on Surface of Mars, 1976" title="MarsVikingLabeledReleaseExperiment" width="560" height="327" class="size-full wp-image-6761" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Viking Lander During Labeled Release Experiment on Surface of Mars, 1976</p></div>
<p>After seeing the non-biological data cluster sort so well with the control experiments from the Viking mission and likewise seeing the active experiments sort with known terrestrial biological specimens, Miller says, &#8220;It is amazing that life is so ordered.&#8221;</p>
<p>And since healthy living systems are so complex with a high degree of order, they tend to get less orderly as the degrade over time. But why? Well, Miller thinks, &#8220;It is probably because Earth is not a closed system. energy is pumped into our environment from the sun and plants use that energy to make complex chemicals, some of which we eat, allowing us to grow, develop intelligence and create civilizations.&#8221;</p>
<p>And in their complexity analysis that&#8217;s what the team found.</p>
<p>By looking at all the biological and non-biological data over time the scientists found changes in the biological data and no change in the non-biological. The paper says, &#8220;It demonstrated that the complexity measures evolve over time in the direction of disorder.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with the possible chemical explanations over the years Levin and Straat cling to a biological interpretation of the Mars Viking lander data. More scientists have begun considering a biological explanation after the discovery of overlapping regions of methane and water ice deposits at the equator of Mars and the discovery of hardy extremophiles in the sub-soil desert region here on Earth. Maybe the red planet does have the necessary ingredients for life.</p>
<p>And this complexity analysis may point the way toward evidence of life on Mars.</p>

<p>Scientists may have found life on Mars 36 years ago and just not realized it. During the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/viking/index.html">Viking lander mission</a> to the red planet in 1976, robotic probes scooped up soil samples, including some microbial life.<div id="attachment_6736" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 316px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Viking1Launch.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Viking1Launch.jpg" alt="Viking 1 Launches from Cape Canaveral in 1975" title="Viking 1 launched by a Titan Centaur rocket from Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station" width="306" height="423" class="size-full wp-image-6736" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Viking 1 Launches from Cape Canaveral in 1975</p></div></p>
<p>Initial analysis showed the soil to be bereft of life. But a new mathematical reanalysis may shed new light on the old data.</p>
<p>Neurobiologist <a href="https://my.usc.edu/wp/faculty/ViewDetail.do?uscpvid=scjf9rs3">Joseph Miller</a> from the USC Keck School of Medicine took another look at the numbers and concluded that the lander may have grabbed some Martian dirt containing life decades ago.</p>
<p>This news comes as NASA is in the midst of re-prioritizing its future scientific space program, which includes several planned trips to Mars. Starting next year the science budget will be slashed nine percent and that includes a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/space/story/2012-03-21/arizona-scientists-mars-research-cuts/53681672/1">39 percent cut</a> to the NASA <a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/">Mars Program</a>.</p>
<p>The next Mars mission is now slated for 2018 (at the earliest) and the space agency is <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-04/16/nasa-mars">looking for mission ideas</a> in an effort to redraw the road map to Mars two months after NASA pulled out of two joint missions with the European Space Agency in 2016 and 2018.</p>
<p>For years scientists have maintained the only way to know if life ever existed on Mars is to go there and bring back rock and soil for detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Unfortunately budget realities continue to push Mars and other solar system missions off into the far future. In his latest budget President Obama cut spending for exploration of the solar system by 21 percent, angering scientists and making the joint effort with Europe too expensive to continue.</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press NASA has spent $6.1 billion exploring Mars in the last ten years. Two rovers have been patrolling the planet for five years and this summer a car-sized rover named <em>Curiosity </em>will join <em>Spirit </em>and <em>Opportunity </em>on the red planet where the new $2.5 billion rover will explore the Martian equator.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/nasa-planning-group-takes-key-steps-for-future-mars-exploration-2012-04-13">new NASA team </a>will cull through the mountains of ideas that will flood the agency in an effort to find cost-effective missions to Mars. All ideas must cost less than $700 million and must be ready to fly by 2018.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6737" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MarsVikingLander.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/MarsVikingLander-e1334599118140.jpg" alt="Mars Viking Lander, courtesy of NASA" title="MarsVikingLander" width="325" height="201" class="size-full wp-image-6737" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Mars Viking Lander, courtesy of NASA</p></div>But if Miller&#8217;s mathematical analysis of the 1976 Viking lander data is accurate, then we&#8217;ve already found life on Mars. He contends that there is life in the numbers. The data sets collected in 1976 found there was no sign of biological evidence. But Miller didn&#8217;t just look at the raw data he looked at its complexity.</p>
<p>Since life is a complex system or at least vastly more complex than a non-living system, he believes that proves there is life on Mars.</p>
<p>With great confidence he says, &#8220;On the basis of what we&#8217;ve done so far, I&#8217;d say I&#8217;m 99 percent sure there&#8217;s life there.&#8221; But he&#8217;d like to send a video camera on the next mission to capture microbial life wriggling around under a microscope just to be sure. He says, &#8220;The ultimate proof is to take a video of a Martian bacteria. They should send a microscope &#8212; watch the bacteria move.&#8221;</p>
<p>In 1976 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_biological_experiments#Labeled_Release">Labeled Release experiment</a> looked for signs of life by studying microbial metabolism in soil scooped up by both Viking landers. At the time the general scientific consensus was that the soil contained geological but no biological activity. To confirm microbial life scientists fed the soil samples a radiolabeled nutrient cocktail that if life did exist in the soil would have produced either carbon dioxide or methane as the microbes munched. But that didn&#8217;t happen so scientists concluded that there was no life present.</p>
<p>Miller&#8217;s team pored over the old data and found some interesting and complex patterns &#8212; patterns he says you don&#8217;t find in non-biological soil samples. The team concludes that the high degree of order found in the data is more characteristic of biological, rather than purely physical processes.</p>
<p>Miller says, &#8220;The presence of circadian rhythmicity and a high degree of mathematical complexity most likely means Viking discovered microbial life on Mars over 35 years ago.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_6739" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 570px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mars_Viking_12a002-e1334599283937.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Mars_Viking_12a002-e1334599511176.png" alt="Panoramic View of Mars from Viking Lander, Photo by NASA July 20, 1976" title="Mars_Viking_12a002" width="560" height="114" class="size-full wp-image-6739" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Panoramic View of Mars from Viking Lander, Photo by NASA July 20, 1976</p></div>
<p>But critics are quick to point out that Miller&#8217;s theory hasn&#8217;t been tested on Earth so it couldn&#8217;t possibly work on Mars.</p>
<p><a href="http://spacescience.arc.nasa.gov/staff/chris-mckay">Chris McKay</a> at NASA&#8217;s Ames Research Center in California tells <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/mars-life-viking-landers-discovery-120412.html">Discovery News</a>, &#8220;Ideally to use a technique on data from Mars one would want to show that the technique has been well calibrated and well established on Earth. The need to do so is clear; on Mars we have no way to test the method, while on Earth we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>While far from conclusive Miller thinks his findings are an additional piece of evidence that challenges the popularly held belief that Viking did not find life on Mars.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;To paraphrase an old saying, if it looks like a microbe and acts like a microbe, then it probably is a microbe.&#8221; And to Miller and his team the old Viking lander data shows a level of complexity they would only see associated with biological life.</p>

<p>The unsinkable ship <em>Titanic</em> sank in the frigid waters 100 years ago but a shroud of mystery still surrounds the boat that inspired a box-office breaking blockbuster movie.<div id="attachment_6720" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/RustciclesTitanic.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/RustciclesTitanic-e1334346966961.jpg" alt="Iron-Eating Bacteria is Giving Titanic Rustcicles Which Will Recycle Ship by 2030" title="RustciclesTitanic" width="325" height="403" class="size-full wp-image-6720" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Iron-Eating Bacteria is Giving Titanic Rustcicles Which Will Recycle Ship by 2030</p></div></p>
<p>A couple of years ago, scientists reported that the <em>Titanic </em>remains sitting at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean will be nothing but a rust stain by the year 2030. Newly discovered bacteria (aptly named <em>Halomonas titanicae</em>) found in the scuttled ship&#8217;s icicle-shaped rust deposits along the ship&#8217;s hull are eating away at the metal and essentially recycling it &#8212; a promising method of dealing with cleaned heavy machinery like oil rigs and other rusting hulks of metal buried at sea.</p>
<p>Dalhousie University biologist and geologist <a href="http://sextondigital.library.dal.ca/Titanic/newlife.html">Henrietta Mann</a> says the <em>Halomonas titanicae</em> bacteria is &#8220;able to reproduce and interact with all the other species that are there and then continue to extract the iron away from the steel that the <em>Titanic </em>was made of, and so it’s going to degrade and break down all of the Titanic and it’ll be all gone and recycled.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the 100th Anniversary of the <em>Titanic </em>sinking approached, scientists have tried to figure out what made the steel luxury liner go down after striking an iceberg.</p>
<p>Some blame the moon. A pair of scientists believe that a full moon months before <em>Titanic </em>sailed on her maiden voyage created abnormally high tides near Greenland which allowed a large number of icebergs to break off and sail into the path of the <em>Titanic</em>.</p>
<p>The theory originally put forth in the 1990s by oceanographer Fergus Wood goes like this. And iceberg broke off from the Disko Bay area of Greenland in January 1912 during some super high tides caused by a rare convergence of astronomical factors: within a single 27-hour span on January 4th, Earth came its nearest to the Sun, the Moon was its nearest Earth, and the Moon was full.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6721" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TitanicIceberg.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/TitanicIceberg-e1334347777316.jpg" alt="Photo of Iceberg, from German liner Prinze Adelbert on the morning of April 15, 1912, Hours after Titanic Sank" title="TitanicIceberg" width="325" height="190" class="size-full wp-image-6721" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo of Iceberg, from German liner Prinze Adelbert on the morning of April 15, 1912, Hours after Titanic Sank</p></div>Texas State University astronomers <a href="http://media.skyandtelescope.com/documents/Titanic+layout.pdf">David Olson and Russell Doescher</a> resurrected Wood&#8217;s theory, which was tossed out in 1995 after discovering it would be impossible for an iceberg to travel 1,600 nautical miles to get in the way of the <em>Titanic </em>in just a couple of months. The pair believe a supermoon event may have been enough to dislodge the iceberg which was already near New Foundland and send it south of New Foundland where it ran into the hulking cruise liner. </p>
<p>Olson says, &#8220;The lunar connection may explain how an unusually large number of icebergs got into the path of the Titanic.&#8221;</p>
<p>University of Washington seismologist <a href="http://earthweb.ess.washington.edu/dwp/people/profile.php?name=vidale--john">John Vidale</a> thinks blaming the moon for the <em>Titanic </em>iceberg encounter is weak at best. He tells the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/titanic-moon-may-have-caused-liner-to-sink_n_1326181.html">Huffington Post</a> that a key calculation is missing from the theory. No one knows how much higher the January 4, 1912 tides were to see if they could have had any impact on the release of icebergs southward.</p>
<p>Still, Olson says, &#8220;We don&#8217;t claim to know exactly where the Titanic iceberg was in January 1912 — nobody can know that — but this is a plausible scenario intended to be scientifically reasonable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Geophysicist John Bellini sides with Vidale and remains skeptical. He says, &#8220;It sounds to me like the authors are teasing with chaos theory akin to the classic scenario of a butterfly&#8217;s wings fluttering in one place causing a deadly hurricane thousands of miles away and many weeks later.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vidale studies the weak connection between ocean tides and earthquake activity. Regardless of what the moon was doing, the failure to see the iceberg in time to respond is what sank the <em>Titanic</em>.</p>
<p>Ultimately the ship&#8217;s crew didn&#8217;t see the massive ice block floating toward them in time to change course, killing 1,500 passengers on board and creating the world&#8217;s most famous shipwreck.</p>
<p><a href="http://inadiscover.com/news_events/current/delgado_joins_noaa/">James Delgado</a>, director of maritime heritage at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tells the <a href="http://www.thehour.com/story/523434/scientists-probe-new-theories-in-sinking-of-the-titanic">Associated Press</a> this week that while new research and theories of what happened are important, &#8220;At its most basic what happened is they failed to heed warnings and they hit the iceberg because they were going too fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a just-in-time-for-the-hundredth-anniversary theory Titanic historian Tim Maltin says a freak atmospheric condition known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novaya_Zemlya">Novaya Zemlya</a> may be partly to blame. His latest Titanic e-book called <em><a href="http://averydeceivingnight.com/">A Very Deceiving Night</a></em> lays out a theory that an Arctic mirage could have tricked the crew on a cloudless night.</p>
<p>Though not a scientist Maltin believes that unusually cold sea air underneath a pocket of warm air in the North Atlantic was bending light in such a way as to obscure a large object like a massive iceberg until it was too late.</p>
<p>According to the <em>Titanic </em>logs, the first officer reported a haze on the horizon. Maltin says that rescue boats even ran into the same phenomenon which made it difficult to navigate around icebergs.</p>
<p>Maltin reports that British meteorologists monitored the same area for these oddball temperature inversions and he says they found them there about 60 percent of the time.</p>
<p>The idea of a mirage is not as far-fetched as many would think. When a cold weather front collides with warmer air it causes light passing between the boundary of the two to be bent dramatically, distorting how an object appears.<div id="attachment_6722" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NovayaZemlyaEffect.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/NovayaZemlyaEffect-e1334347998954.jpg" alt="Common Arctic Mirage which Distorts Objects Making Judging Size and Distance Difficult" title="NovayaZemlyaEffect" width="325" height="125" class="size-full wp-image-6722" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Common Arctic Mirage which Distorts Objects Making Judging Size and Distance Difficult</p></div></p>
<p>As crews of pleasure boaters navigate the once-impenetrable Northwest Passage through the Canadian Archipelago similar Arctic mirage stories begin to emerge. Captains of small, lightweight boats are particularly vulnerable to icebergs which dot the area and are sometimes hard to see because the light distortion creates a false horizon.</p>
<p>This theory also explains why Stanley Lord, captain of the nearest ship The Californian, ignored the Titanic&#8217;s distress call because the mirage effect made it look like a much smaller ship, which created confusion during the crisis.</p>
<p>Maltin says, &#8220;‘It does actually make me feel sorry for Captain Lord, knowing now what I know about the science of that night. When he is apparently making excuses, saying the ship he was looking at did not look anything like the <em>Titanic</em>, what I now understand is that he was telling the exact truth.In fact, what he was looking at did not look anything like the Titanic at all.</p>
<p>Maltin, who is releasing a new documentary about the disaster on the National Geographic channel says, &#8220;It&#8217;s almost as though the <em>Titanic </em>sank in a killing zone of nature where all these dangerous elements combined to make it fatal.&#8221;</p>
<p>After looking at the weather charts in the area, he concludes that the ship was also right in the middle of an extreme Arctic high pressure system. In fact he says at 1,035 millibars, that is the highest pressure anywhere in North America. And that pressure usually sits over the North Pole but for a number of reasons it dipped south, setting up perfect conditions to help sink the <em>Titanic</em>.</p>
<p>After poring over weather records from the time, Maltin concluded that the ship sank at the exact location and time that freezing waters from the Arctic flowing along the Labrador Current met hotter air from the Gulf Stream. This system of ocean currents comprises the North Atlantic Oscillation or the great ocean conveyor belt that shuttles warm water from the Caribbean to the North Atlantic, allowing Great Britain to enjoy a temperate climate.</p>
<p>He also says because a clear night Arctic mirage bent the light rays passing through the air at this point the Titanic sailed directly towards the giant iceberg for a full 20 minutes because the hunk of floating ice was completely obscured by the false horizon and completely out of view of the ship look-outs.</p>
<p>Maltin attributes the botched rescue to the same effect, known as the scintillation. It&#8217;s what makes stars appear to twinkle as light gets distorted when it passes through the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere.</p>
<p>During the attempted rescue of the passengers on board the <em>Titanic</em>, Maltin says the rescue flares probably appeared to the crew of the <em>Californian </em>to be the mast flickering under the stars or ordinary lights on the deck.</p>
<p>He says the cold mirage also explains why SOS Morse lamp signals got crossed. He says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent years wondering why these two ships which were trying to Morse each other all night couldn&#8217;t communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The British historian says the <em>Titanic </em>sank not because of avoidable human error but because of air density difference.</p>
<p>As the world gears up for the 100th Anniversary of the sinking of the <em>Titanic</em> this weekend surely more theories of the whys and wherefores of the famous mid-sea collision will surface causing the scientific speculation to go on and on&#8230;</p>

<p>A major <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/usc000905e.php">8.6 magnitude earthquake</a> struck off the coast of the island of Sumatra in the Indian Ocean, triggering a tsunami alert for the whole ocean and traumatizing those who lived through the 2004 9.1 earthquake that killed more than 230,000 in 12 countries.</p>
<p>But this earthquake was all bark and no bite. Very few reports of damage and injuries have been reported. And no big tsunami threatened the area.</p>
<p>U.S. Geological Survey seismologist <a href="http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/hough/">Susan Hough</a> says, &#8220;It&#8217;s clearly a bit of an odd duck.&#8221; <div id="attachment_6699" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 154px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EarthquakeTypes.gif"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EarthquakeTypes.gif" alt="Movement of Crust during Earthquakes, courtesy of the USGS" title="EarthquakeTypes" width="144" height="360" class="size-full wp-image-6699" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Movement of Crust during Earthquakes, courtesy of the USGS</p></div></p>
<p>That is in large part due to the type of earthquake. The quake that struck today and an 8.2 aftershock that followed are <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?term=strike-slip">strike-slip</a> quakes. While unusual in this seismically active part of the world, this type of quake is far less devastating and typically doesn&#8217;t cause a tsunami because of the direction of the shaking.</p>
<p>Strike-slip quakes occur when the earth&#8217;s crust fractures along a fault line creating two blocks. In a strike-slip quake the two blocks of the Earth&#8217;s crust move side to side (either left or right) not up and down. Because there is only horizontal movement, the seafloor does not get displaced. That seafloor displacement pushes water up and causes tsunami.</p>
<p>But scientists are puzzled because a strike-slip quake like this is usually much smaller.</p>
<p>Penn State University geosciences professor <a href="http://geodyn.psu.edu/people/kevin.htm">Kevin Furlong</a> tells the Associated Press, &#8220;A week ago, we wouldn&#8217;t have thought we could have a strike-slip earthquake of this size. This is very, very large.&#8221;</p>
<p>By contrast, the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake">San Francisco earthquake of 1906</a> was the biggest strike-slip quake on record. And it measured 7.8 on the Richter scale. During that quake, the ground shifted about 15 feet. </p>
<p>Geologists believe that during today&#8217;s Indonesian quake one side of the fault lurched 70 feet past the other, making it the strongest strike-slip fault quake on record and the 11th most powerful earthquake since record-keeping began in 1900.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6700" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2004AcehTsunami.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/2004AcehTsunami.jpg" alt="2004 Aceh Tsunami Overpowers Indonesians" title="2004AcehTsunami" width="275" height="406" class="size-full wp-image-6700" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">2004 Aceh Tsunami Overpowers Indonesians</p></div>In 2004, the same region of Indonesia was devastated by a thrust fault earthquake, where a block of crust moved vertically, causing the seafloor to drop and propagated dangerous tsunami that wreaked havoc from India to Thailand and hit Indonesia especially hard.</p>
<p>British geological seismologist Susanne Sargeant says, &#8220;We have had two blocks rubbing together, it&#8217;s called a strike-slip earthquake &#8230; That means there hasn&#8217;t been any displacement of the sea floor. Although an earthquake of this magnitude has the potential to cause a large tsunami, the fact that we haven&#8217;t seen any drop of the sea floor, which is what generates the wave, it looks like the possibility of a tsunami being generated is low&#8221;.</p>
<p>And within hours of the first big quake, the <a href="http://ptwc.weather.gov/">Pacific Tsunami Warning Center</a> in Hawaii canceled its alert for the Indian Ocean. Several tsunami ranging between six inches and 3 feet did follow the quakes but they were not enough to cause damage, even on low-lying islands that sit barely above sea level.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usgs.gov/blogs/features/usgs_top_story/magnitude-8-6-earthquake-strikes-northern-sumatra-indonesia/?from=image">U.S. Geological Survey</a> issued the following statement right after the quake.</p>
<blockquote><p>Large strike-slip earthquakes, while rare, are not unprecedented in this region of the Indo-Australian plate. Since the massive M 9.1 earthquake that ruptured a 1300 km long segment of the Sumatran megathrust plate boundary in December of 2004, three large strike-slip events have occurred within 50 km of the April 11, 2012 even. These earthquakes occurred on April 19 2006 (Mw6.2), October 4 2007 (Mw6.2) and January 10, 2012 (Mw7.2). In all three cases, the style of faulting was similar. These events align approximately with fabric of the sea floor in the diffuse boundary zone between the Indian and Australian plates.</p>
<p>The M8.6 April 11, 2012 earthquake off the west coast of northern Sumatra, Indonesia, occurred as a result of strike-slip faulting within the oceanic lithosphere of the Indo-Australia plate. The quake was located approximately 100 km to the southwest of the major subduction zone that defines the plate boundary between the Indo-Australia and Sunda plates offshore Sumatra. At this location, the Indo-Australia plate moves north-northeast with respect to the Sunda plate at a velocity of approximately 52 mm/yr. </p></blockquote>
<div id="attachment_6702" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SumatraQuakeMap.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SumatraQuakeMap-e1334184705983.jpg" alt="Site of April 11 Sumatra Earthquake in Relation to Minor Tectonic Plates" title="SumatraQuakeMap" width="325" height="261" class="size-full wp-image-6702" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Site of April 11 Sumatra Earthquake in Relation to Minor Tectonic Plates</p></div>
<p>Amy Vaughan, a geophysicist with the National Earthquake Information Center says the big difference between today&#8217;s quakes and the 9.1 temblor in 2004 was location. These quakes were both relatively shallow (14 miles and 10 miles) and situated 110 miles from the edge of the Eurasian plate, firmly over the Australian plate.</p>
<p>If the fault happened at the subduction zone, where the two plates meet, a tsunami would have been the likely outcome. And with the distance from the plate boundary comes a less devastating event.</p>
<p>While those strike-slip fault earthquakes are fairly unusual in this region, there have been three big ones since the massive thrust fault earthquake in 2004 that ripped open a 1,500 mile fault line. The fault during oday&#8217;s big quake slipped 70 feet.</p>
<p>Since the 2004 earthquake and tsunami Unesco has helped install a seismic monitoring and communication system so anytime an earthquake strikes in the Indian Ocean, sensors placed on the seafloor can detect any change in the water column and that information can be sent to all countries in the path of a potential tsunami within minutes.</p>
<p>After today&#8217;s quake and aftershocks, officials say that all alerts went out within five minutes even though the quake didn&#8217;t produce any tsunami.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6703" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SundaTrenchQuakes.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SundaTrenchQuakes.jpg" alt="Large Quakes Involving the Sunda Trench" title="SundaTrenchQuakes" width="250" height="296" class="size-full wp-image-6703" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Large Quakes Involving the Sunda Trench</p></div>British seismologist <a href="http://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/people/fellows/luckett.html">Richard Luckett</a> thinks the quakes today are part of a resetting of the fault system. He says, &#8220;What we think this is, is some kind of correction to do with all the massive earthquakes that have happened in the Sunda trench in the last 10 years. He tells the BBC, &#8220;And so this kind of earthquake, although very big and widely felt, is much less likely to cause a serious tsunami.&#8221; </p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunda_Trench">Sunda trench</a> is a large depression in the ocean floor where the Indian and Australian tectonic plates presse into and under the larger Eurasian tectonic plate. </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="http://eplayer.clipsyndicate.com/embed/iframe?pf_id=1&#038;show_title=0&#038;va_id=3411051&#038;windows=1" width="425" height="330"></iframe></p>
<p>Twenty years ago Judy Avery Arroyo stumbled into her calling to rehabilitate injured and abandoned sloths in Costa Rica. The bed and breakfast owner from Alaska and her Costa Rican husband now run one of the largest sloth sanctuaries in the world. With over 130 sloths under their care, it all started with Buttercup.</p>
<p>When some neighbor girls brought the three-toed baby sloth to Arroyo, she took one look at its cute face and decided to take it in. Now she says, &#8220;I cupped the tiny animal in my hands and knew I had to do something.&#8221; Buttercup was dying of starvation and had been abandoned by her mother who Arroyo presumes was killed by a jungle animal.</p>
<p>People around her advised her to let the baby sloth go because she wouldn&#8217;t be able to feed it. In those days, very little was known about sloths. But Arroyo decided to learn how to care for Buttercup and after what she says was a lot of trial and error and a good bit of intuition, the baby sloth began to thrive after a couple of tough months.<div id="attachment_6683" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Sloth1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Sloth1-e1334087354476.jpg" alt="Buttercup, 20-year-old Queen of the Sloth Sanctuary, Aviarios del Caribe" title="Sloth1" width="325" height="488" class="size-full wp-image-6683" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Buttercup, 20-year-old Queen of the Sloth Sanctuary, Aviarios del Caribe</p></div></p>
<p>Now Buttercup holds the record of being the oldest sloth in captivity and is a tourist attraction in eastern Costa Rica, where according to Arroyo the matron sloth &#8220;reigns supreme over the veranda&#8221; at the <a href="http://www.slothsanctuary.com">sloth sanctuary</a>.</p>
<p>As the founder of the sloth rescue center at <a href="http://www.ogphoto.com/aviarios/about.htm">Aviarios del Caribe</a> Arroyo has helped hundreds of the world’s slowest mammals. Sloths are found across parts of Central and South America and call the jungles of Costa Rica home. There are six-known species across the continent and the Costa Rican sanctuary is home to the Bradypus and Choleopus genuses. According to the World Wildlife Fund, many species of the sloth are at risk of extinction. The animals are under severe pressure from urban development including electrical cabling strung up through its habitats and deforestation across the country.</p>
<p>Sanctuary veterinarian Marcelo Espinoza says, &#8220;There are many cases of electrocutions and they recover here, there are also fractures when they fall from trees and [we] repair their limbs and send them back to the jungle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Arroyo says, &#8220;Many have been maimed by electric wires, or tortured by cruel humans. They require our constant attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sloths have caught the world&#8217;s attention. A series of videos shot at the sloth sanctuary in Costa Rica are wildly popular on Animal Planet.</p>
<p><iframe id="dit-video-embed" width="512" height="288" src="http://static.discoverymedia.com/videos/components/apl/e938cc97235ae2e385bde48861a2ec341bed77ae/snag-it-player.html?auto=no" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></p>
<p>CNN newsman and daytime talk show <a href="http://www.andersoncooper.com/2012/03/09/anderson-on-sloths-my-favorite-animal-in-the-world/">Anderson Cooper loves sloths</a>. During a 2007 CNN special he and animal expert Jeff Corwin visited the jungle of Costa Rica where they help return sloths to the wild. <div id="attachment_6690" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/AndersonCooperJackHannaSloth.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/AndersonCooperJackHannaSloth-e1334089086116.jpg" alt="Anderson Cooper, Jack Hanna and a Sloth" title="AndersonCooperJackHannaSloth" width="325" height="227" class="size-full wp-image-6690" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Anderson Cooper, Jack Hanna and a Sloth</p></div></p>
<p>Cooper says sloths are his favorite animal. On a recent episode of his eponymous show Anderson he told animal wrangler Jack Hanna that he looked into getting a sloth but decided against it, learning that exotic animals never make good pets.</p>
<p>The sloth sanctuary outside of Limon, Costa Rica has also become the center of sloth research. After 20 years of behavioral and medical study Arroyo and her team of sloth watchers have gathered a lot of good data about these unusual animals.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6684" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Sloth2.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Sloth2-e1334087536136.jpg" alt="Twin Orphaned Baby Two-Fingered Hoffman&#039;s Sloths, photo by Suzi Eszterhas" title="Sloth2" width="250" height="329" class="size-full wp-image-6684" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Twin Orphaned Baby Two-Fingered Hoffman&#039;s Sloths, photo by Suzi Eszterhas</p></div>Sloths live high in the jungle canopy and only venture to ground level to go to the bathroom once a week for a few minutes before lumbering back to the safety of high trees. In the rainforest, sloths accumulate algae on their fur which helps them blend into their environment. They can even roll into a ball resembling a coconut if they need to hide from jaguars or other jungle predators.</p>
<p>As the slowest moving land mammal they spend a lot of time digesting food and sleeping. Sloths sleep about 18 hours a day. </p>
<p>Costa Rica is home to the brown-throated bradypus sloth which has three toes. Unlike the other sloth genus found in Costa Rica, the bradypus are diurnal, meaning they are active during the day. They can turn their heads 180 degrees, have telescopic vision and are agile swimmers.</p>
<p>The two-fingered Hoffman&#8217;s sloth is the only member of the choloepus genus found in Costa Rica. The choloepus is larger than the bradypus and it is nocturnal. It also has peripheral vision, which helps to keep it safe from predators.</p>
<p>Luis and Judy Arroyo say their private wildlife sanctuary is a living biology classroom. They invite students and researchers to use the various habitats of Aviarios del Caribe as the object of their research.<div id="attachment_6685" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Sloth3.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Sloth3-e1334087804868.jpg" alt="Three Two-Fingered Hoffman&#039;s Sloths Prepare for a Tea Bath" title="Sloth3" width="325" height="243" class="size-full wp-image-6685" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Three Two-Fingered Hoffman&#039;s Sloths Prepare for a Tea Bath, courtesy of Sloth Sanctuary</p></div></p>
<p>Arroyo still offers a bed and breakfast experience at the sloth sanctuary, where tourists are flocking to volunteer to spend time with the animals. </p>
<p>But despite their best efforts humans are no replacement a baby sloth&#8217;s mother. Arroyo says, &#8220;This is a problem that we&#8217;re facing. How do we teach a baby, who has arrived and is less than a year old, who doesn&#8217;t have the information that its mother provides? Because in the jungle all the trees that they eat from have their defenses and the mother needs to teach the baby how to choose the correct quantity of a leaf that is toxic and change to another tree. It&#8217;s very complicated.&#8221;</p>

<p>Abstract artists Daniel Hill and Ron Janowich say, &#8220;Art and science are both born from a sense of wonder and curiosity and a desire to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a series of conversations about the complexity of the natural world, the two men decided to mount an exhibition, featuring the artistic side of science. Looking at scientific theory with artist eyes helps convey very complicated technical information to a broad audience. </p>
<p>And while no collaborating artists are scientists, their work incorporates the precision and accuracy of science and math to tell a story about the subject, which often is rooted in science.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6674" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureMannAttractors.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureMannAttractors-e1334073758647.jpg" alt="Attractors (2012) by David Mann, courtesy of Lafayette College" title="Emergence&amp;StructureMannAttractors" width="400" height="404" class="size-full wp-image-6674" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Attractors (2012) by David Mann, courtesy of Lafayette College</p></div>The traveling exhibit <em>Emergence &#038; Structure</em> takes specific aspects of science, adapts scientifically inspired methodologies, conceptual underpinnings, natural systems or structures that exist in all scales throughout the universe and turns it into art. </p>
<p>Hill and Janowich say, &#8220;Whether it is the Higg&#8217;s boson particle and the origin of mass/structure (the so-called &#8220;God particle&#8221;); Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle; entanglement’s &#8220;spooky action at a distance&#8221;; or the experience of perception and the origin of consciousness, these ideas prove not only irresistible but abound in profound and potentially unrealized implications in the quest to comprehend our world.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the foreword of the exhibition catalog, neuroscientist Jonah Lehrer says that people have an innate need to see the world as it is but also to make sense of what we see. He says that need explains the necessity of art. He says, &#8220;Within the framework of art we are able to affirm simultaneously the mystery, even as we seek to unravel it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hidden within the abstract are patterns that elicit a feeling of familiarity that conveys truth about the world around us. </p>
<p>Lehrer says, &#8220;Even when staring at these deliberate abstractions, we still see the familiar stuff of life, those forms we never seem to leave behind. They emerge, like ghosts, from the brushstrokes and charcoal marks, from the acrylic on wood and the shellac on paper. Such simple materials give rise to such complex thoughts that the artist provokes us to see patterns while forcing us to recognize where these patterns emanate from.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two curators say the artists in &#8220;their investigations into the sciences have added significantly to the theoretical<br />
foundation of their practice.&#8221; They say the <em>Emergence &#038; Structure</em> exhibition is an expression of that understanding.<div id="attachment_6666" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureAslanidisSonicNetworkNo10.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureAslanidisSonicNetworkNo10-e1334013425745.jpg" alt="Sonic Network No. 10 (2011) by John Aslanidis, courtesy of Location One" title="Emergence&amp;StructureAslanidisSonicNetworkNo10" width="325" height="258" class="size-full wp-image-6666" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sonic Network No. 10 (2011) by John Aslanidis, courtesy of Location One</p></div></p>
<p>Since the 1990s, electronic music buff and Australian visual artist <a href="http://johnaslanidis.com/">John Aslanidis</a> has been exploring the relationship between optical and sound art by looking at patterns of waves, frequencies and vibrations. In each of his paintings, he uses color and line patterns to create a visual intensity that invokes the experience of listening to music.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6667" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureAslanidisSonicCurrentNo2.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureAslanidisSonicCurrentNo2-e1334013905293.jpg" alt="Sonic Current No. 2 (2007) by John Aslanidis, courtesy of Lafayette College" title="Emergence&amp;StructureAslanidisSonicCurrentNo2" width="325" height="276" class="size-full wp-image-6667" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Sonic Current No. 2 (2007) by John Aslanidis, courtesy of Lafayette College</p></div>Aslandidis says, &#8220;This latest phase adds another level of complexity, and interactivity, between the intersecting patterns in the paintings. My intention is to create imagery with a sonic resonance where there is no start or end point. They capture a fragment of infinity and represent a sense of a perpetual change.&#8221;</p>
<p>His sonic painting series includes <em>Sonic Current No. 2</em> and <em>Sonic Network No. 10</em>, which are featured in the current Emergence &#038; Structure exhibition. He says he draws concentric circles with a beam compass and uses a lot of masking tape. Then he layers oil or acrylic airbrushed paint in alternating layers to mirror his own cyclic creative process. He believes his paintings represent a fragment of infinity, a scientific concept that is difficult to show visually but somehow the visual depiction of sound makes this pattern easier to recognize.</p>
<p>Angie Drakopoulos is trying to to find balance between the complex and the simple in her mixed media art. And in the process she is trying to unite the scientific with the mystical.</p>
<p>Using symmetry as her base, she adds elements from biology, geometry, physics, metaphysics and eastern philosophy. She says, &#8220;I try to find the most subtle and interesting way to connect the different elements that will reveal an underlying structure or system.&#8221;<div id="attachment_6668" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureDrakopoulosNegentropyIII-e1334016134480.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureDrakopoulosNegentropyIII-e1334016134480.jpg" alt="Negentropy III (2007) by Angie Drakopoulos, courtesy of Lafayette College" title="Emergence&amp;StructureDrakopoulosNegentropyIII" width="325" height="242" class="size-full wp-image-6668" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Negentropy III (2007) by Angie Drakopoulos, courtesy of Lafayette College</p></div></p>
<p>In her acrylic and resin on plexiglass <em>Negentropy III</em>, Drakopoulos explores the intersection point between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_and_life">entropy and life</a>. Nobel Prize-winning physicist Erwin Schrödinger introduced the concept of negative entropy or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negentropy">negentropy </a>in his popular 1944 science book<em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_is_Life%3F_%28Schr%C3%B6dinger%29">What is Life?</a></em> In the book Schrödinger states that life feeds on negative entropy. For example, people eat dead food in order to stay alive. In other words the entropy that a living system exports to keep its own entropy low is negentropy.</p>
<p>Drakopoulos expresses the very complex physics with light. She allows refined and intricate patterns to emerge as light dances over the paintings&#8217; surface, showing different tonalities of iridescent paint locked in the translucent layers. She says, &#8220;Slowly as the work evolves, these inner connections and details begin to form an alternative definition of the energy and invisible forces that govern the movement of matter, from the microcosmic level of molecules and light particles, to the macrocosmic level of planets and galaxies.&#8221; For her the work then becomes a &#8220;diagram for energy and a quest for unity.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6670" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureHillUntitled8.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureHillUntitled8-e1334072410382.jpg" alt="Untitled 8 (2011) by Daniel Hill, courtesy of DanielHill.net" title="Emergence&amp;StructureHillUntitled8" width="325" height="247" class="size-full wp-image-6670" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Untitled 8 (2011) by Daniel Hill, courtesy of DanielHill.net</p></div>Exhibition co-curator Hill uses squeeze bottles of acrylic paint to showcase the &#8220;omnipresence of pattern in life and systems,&#8221; drawn from physics and eastern philosophy. He says the final product &#8220;recalls patterns which we are surrounded by by rarely notice or even see such as: gravity, sound, light, water, magnetism, or thought, emotions, breath or pulse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hill says we are expert modelers, relentlessly constructing visual models to truly see the world, including the parts of the world that we can&#8217;t possible see with our eyes. He says, &#8220;Visual modeling is an invaluable tool in both how we perceive our world and how information about our universe can be organized and better understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The abstract artist takes abstract theories, ideas and concepts of science that are often difficult to comprehend. With the aid of visual models and the language of abstraction Hill and the other exhibition artists can be transform physics, biology and neuroscience into more easily digestible and familiar forms, such as graphs, schematics, diagrams, and maps. <div id="attachment_6671" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureHillUntitled9.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/EmergenceStructureHillUntitled9-e1334072519129.jpg" alt="Untitled 9 (2011) by Daniel Hill, courtesy of DanielHill.net" title="Emergence&amp;StructureHillUntitled9" width="325" height="242" class="size-full wp-image-6671" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Untitled 9 (2011) by Daniel Hill, courtesy of DanielHill.net</p></div> </p>
<p>Hill believes that our collective future is deeply rooted in the imagination and that abstract art such as that featured in <em>Emergence &#038; Structure</em> plays a role not in answering the big questions of life and the natural world. But rather, this type of art can play a larger role in our understanding of the world by helping to reveal the right questions to ask.</p>
<p>He says we did not solve the great problems of the past with a sudden influx of intellectual capability. Hill says, &#8220;What did change was our ability to look at the problem in new ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>Spring has barely sprung and already much of the country is experiencing abnormally high temperatures. Trees are budding a month early and over <a href="http://motherjones.com/environment/2012/03/record-heat-wave-grips-us-it-climate-change">7,000 March high temperature records</a> have been broken. Across the Northeast and Midwest winter has suddenly turned into summer.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6658" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LakeMichiganWaders.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LakeMichiganWaders-e1332543550193.jpg" alt="Brave Waders Hit the Beach around Lake Michigan as Temps Soared above 80, courtesy of Bill Steffen" title="LakeMichiganWaders" width="325" height="193" class="size-full wp-image-6658" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Brave Waders Hit the Beach around Lake Michigan as March Temps Soared above 80, courtesy of Bill Steffen</p></div>Lake Michigan is as <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2057">warm now</a> as it normally is in June. A balmy 78-degree day in Chicago had people talking, including President Barack Obama who says he&#8217;s &#8220;a little nervous&#8221; about global warming. The President said, &#8220;It’s warm every place. It gets you a little nervous about what’s happening to global temperatures. But when it’s 75 degrees in Chicago in the beginning of March it gets you thinking.&#8221; At a <a href="http://grist.org/climate-change/freak-heat-wave-makes-obama-and-oprah-nervous-about-climate/">campaign fundraiser</a> with Oprah Winfrey, the TV network owner said, &#8220;Something&#8217;s wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of temperatures hovering in the mid-40s for early March, the windy city has been enjoying an unseasonably warm streak of 80-degree days, including reaching 87 degrees March 21. Chicago rarely reaches the 80-degree mark in April, let alone March.</p>
<p>International Falls, Minnesota saw a 93-degree temperature swing from -14 to 79 from March 9-18. Marquette, Michigan obliterated its old March 21 record high of 49, replacing it with a new record of 81. Even the low temperatures that day was higher than the old record high.</p>
<p>Those staggering numbers have meterologists across the heartland using words like &#8220;freak heatwave,&#8221; &#8220;record heat wave.&#8221; And <em><a href="http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-03/2012-heat-wave-almost-science-fiction-mind-boggling">Popular Science</a></em> says it&#8217;s &#8220;almost like science fiction.&#8221; <div id="attachment_6655" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 515px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/HeatWave2012.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/HeatWave2012.jpg" alt="Partial List of Records Set during 2012 Spring Heat Wave" title="HeatWave2012" width="505" height="287" class="size-full wp-image-6655" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Partial List of Records Set during 2012 Spring Heat Wave</p></div></p>
<p>University of Edinburgh climate scientist <a href="http://www.geos.ed.ac.uk/homes/ghegerl">Gabi Hegerl</a> sees evidence that extreme heat events like the one that began in a good chunk of the U.S. on March 12 have become more common and more severe, including at the regional level in parts of the U.S. She says, &#8220;This is consistent with observing more and stronger heat waves.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she is not alone. A group of climate scientists are studying the role that climate change plays in individual extreme weather events. They are pioneering a new scientific discipline called <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/csi/whatis/">climate attribution</a>. And they agree that global warming has made March&#8217;s summer-like temperatures more likely but they say that natural variability also played a vital role.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6654" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MapleTappers.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MapleTappers-e1332542370645.jpg" alt="Two Technical College Students Tap a Maple Tree in Vermont where Warm Weather and No Snow Cover Means a Short Sugaring Season " title="MapleTappers" width="325" height="244" class="size-full wp-image-6654" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Two Technical College Students Tap a Maple Tree in Vermont where Warm Weather and No Snow Cover Means a Short Sugaring Season. Photo by Trent Campbell, courtesy of Addison Indpendent</p></div>Since the climate is a very complex system it is difficult to pinpoint exact cause and effect relationships without careful study. And while the current bout of heat is still ongoing (but likely to peter out over the weekend) scientists plan to look at it carefully over the next few months.</p>
<p>Hegerl suggests conducting climate model studies where scientists compare the odds of this event occurring with and without added greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, &#8220;to see how much the warming has changed the odds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scientific studies of previous heat waves using this probability-based approach have shown that global warming is increasing the odds of heat extremes. But to what extent is unclear. </p>
<p>Both global-warming trends and shifts in atmospheric circulation are help make an extreme weather event, so scientists need to observe the whole climate system in order to investigate how often an event with these extreme characteristics takes place under the two alternative scenarios.</p>
<p>A study published in the October issue of the Journal <em><a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/44/17905.abstract">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a></em> found a local warming trend in the Moscow, Russia area is quintupling the number of heat records there per decade. The study also concluded that there is an 80 percent chance that the 2010 July monthly heat record in Russia wouldn&#8217;t have happened without global warming.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v432/n7017/abs/nature03089.html">similar study</a> after the European heat wave in 2003 reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p>NOAA deputy research director <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/people/randall.m.dole/">Randall M. Dole</a> says the U.S. spring heat wave is &#8220;absolutely&#8221; global warming. He says, &#8220;The planet as a whole is warming, the continents on average are warming faster than the oceans, so there is a great body of scientific evidence that would support such an interpretation. The question is how much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Moscow heat wave study suggests that global warming enables extreme heat events, increasing the frequency of such weather anomalies but not causing them directly or being responsible for one extreme event characteristic.</p>
<p>Dr. Dole says that climate change definitely stacked the deck in favor of this springtime heat wave but global warming&#8217;s small role just doesn&#8217;t explain its intensity.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6653" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Heatwave2012map.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Heatwave2012map-e1332541388913.png" alt="Top: Massive Heat Dome over Eastern North America on March 22.

Bottom: Satellite Image Showing Low Pressure Forming over Midwest to Push Heat Dome East. Photos courtesy of Wright Weather and Stu Ostro, University of Washington</p></div>That he attributes that to a massive ridge of high pressure in the Jet Stream that is blocking weather systems from much of the country and he thinks the lack of snowpack also played a role. With less snow than average (thanks to a warm winter) sunlight doesn&#8217;t bounce as much energy off a white ground or keep the air temperatures near the ground cooler. </p>
<p>The high pressure dome that is blocking storms from reaching the midsection of the U.S. and Canada are similar to those that influenced the Moscow heat wave in 2010 and the European heat wave in 2003.</p>
<p>Scientists don&#8217;t yet understand what causes these big high pressure systems that block incoming weather systems and they don&#8217;t yet grasp what effects climate change are having on the frequency and intensity of those patterns.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/people/martin.hoerling/">Martin Hoerling</a> agrees with Dole that climate change didn&#8217;t play a leading role in this spring heat wave. He says, &#8220;Meteorology, not climate change, is the main ingredient in the current March 2011 U.S. extreme warmth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Climate scientist <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/trenbert.html">Kevin Trenberth</a> says, &#8220;Indeed [greenhouse gas-driven] warming is not dominant, but I suspect when all the evidence is in we will find that the event likely would not have occurred without global warming.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;The odds will be so low.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this burst of springtime summer is about to end. The high pressure system is breaking down already and a wet weekend is on the way thanks to a low pressure system that will push out the high.</p>
<p>Well-known global warming advocate <a href="http://www.billmckibben.com/">Bill McKibben</a> summed up the heat wave on <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/billmckibben">Twitter </a>saying, &#8220;I know I’m a little obsessed with this heat wave&#8211;but: it’s not just off the charts, it’s off the wall the charts are tacked to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Capital Weather Gang at the <em><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/capital-weather-gang/post/epic-march-heat-wave-to-conclude-in-midwest-great-lakes-link-to-global-warming/2012/03/22/gIQA6hj3TS_blog.html?tid=pm_local_pop">Washington Post</a></em> says, &#8220;Meteorologists and other weather commentators have frequently commented they’ve never seen anything like this, exhausting superlatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a round-up of the popular words weather forecasters have used to describe Spring Heat Wave 2012: Mind-boggling, eye-popping, unthinkable, unreal, unbelievable, astonishing, unfathomable, historic, unprecedented, crazy, insane, mutant, incredible, amazing, stunning, unheard of, surreal, remarkable, jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>When low temperatures are the same as previous record highs, the deputy director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Climate Prediction Center calls that &#8220;incredible.&#8221; <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/information/personnel/index_staff.shtml">Mike Halpert</a> says,&#8221;To me, that&#8217;s just mind-boggling.&#8221; </p>

<p>Who could say No to a face like this? Especially when that face is attached to a scientist doing cool research? <div id="attachment_6634" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 233px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/KevinMiklasz.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/KevinMiklasz-e1332442083394.jpg" alt="Kevin Miklasz, Independent Scientist" title="KevinMiklasz" width="223" height="229" class="size-full wp-image-6634" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Kevin Miklasz, Independent Scientist</p></div></p>
<p><a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/denny/kevin.html">Kevin Miklasz</a> is just about to finish his PhD in Biomechanics at Stanford University. At the end of the month he&#8217;ll be one of many well-educated scientists without big research dollars or a university to back his future work. He&#8217;s opted to help develop science curriculum for an after school program for most of the year and then devote his two-month summer break to his own research. More and more this is becoming the norm for scientists.</p>
<p>Shrinking basic research budgets and a glut of smart graduates has created a problem &#8212; too many brains and not enough jobs.</p>
<p>But venture capitalist and life-long lover of science <a href="http://www.mattsalzberg.com/">Matt Salzberg</a> is stepping in with his new crowdfunding site <a href="http://www.petridish.org/">Petridish.org</a>. It&#8217;s a platform that allows independent scientists like Miklasz who need to collect basic data or conduct preliminary research before they attempt to secure big National Science Foundation grants.</p>
<p>Petridish is not the first site to attempt to match researchers with unfunded projects with a science-appreciative donor base. The <a href="http://scifund.wordpress.com/">SciFund Challenge</a> launched by media and arts crowdfunding source <a href="http://www.rockethub.com/">RocketHub</a> has helped raise tens of thousands of dollars for different projects. And, <a href="http://sciflies.org/">SciFlies.org</a> is a non-profit platform doing the same thing.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding has become a disruptive way to turn the venture capital business model for start-up organizations upside down. Instead of a lot of money coming from one or a few sources, crowdfunding encourages little bits of money from many people &#8212; the crowd. And the beauty of it is that nobody pays anything until the goal amount is raised in pledges during a certain period of time.</p>
<p>Salzberg says, &#8220;Petridish is an online community of scientists and everyday science-lovers that allows researchers to connect with private donors interested in their work.&#8221;</p>
<p>So because of this new model to fund science research, soon-to-be Dr. Miklasz will be able to do his work, which could shed some much-needed light on the future health of oceans.</p>
<p>As a biomechanic, Miklasz looks at biology from a physics perspective. He wants to know what forces exert pressure on biological organisms to make them look the way they do. And, his current plant passion happens to be seaweed. It may not sound like a sexy science project.</p>
<p>But 28 backers helped raise the necessary $1,000 he asked for through Petridish.org and with 30 days to go he&#8217;s actually raised 140 percent of his target.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6639" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Algae.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Algae-e1332459255937.jpg" alt="Adult Algae on Rocky Coastline" title="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="325" height="243" class="size-full wp-image-6639" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Adult Algae on Rocky Coastline</p></div>He wants to know why algae offspring are &#8220;so bizarrely shaped and small&#8221; and if that morphology will benefit them in the future. He says, &#8220;The answer, I propose, may strangely enough lie in the physics of the waves that bash against these spores.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his crowdfunding pitch he points out that algal spores are one-tenth the size of a period at the end of a sentence (like this one.) Yet, he says they grow to be gigantic, some reaching the size of redwood trees hundreds of feet tall.</p>
<p>He thinks that physics and particularly the wave crashing of reef break near-shore environments has something to say about the size and shape of algae spores.</p>
<p>And thanks to a group of public supporters, he&#8217;ll take his experiment to <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/fhl/">Friday Harbor Labs</a> in the San Juan Islands of Washington state where in their new state-of-science ocean acidification tank he&#8217;ll see how well these little buggers fare in future ocean waters which will be warmer and contain a higher acid content.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;As we put more CO2 into the atmosphere, more CO2 will end up in the oceans, which in turn makes the water more acidic and toxic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because more acid oceans create difficulty for shell-building creatures at the bottom of the food chain to grow calcium rich shells, Miklasz supposes the same will hold true of important coralline algae, which could be wiped out before we know anything about them.</p>
<p>His crowdfunded project will be the first attempt to try to characterize the influence of ocean acidification on juvenile algae. Other scientists have long been looking at how changes in ocean chemistry will affect juvenile fish and other animal species. But Miklasz says he&#8217;s the first to think about algae.</p>
<p>In concrete terms his experiment will create a shear flume &#8212; think of it like a high-pressure water chute &#8212; to pummel algae in a simulated ocean of the future. He&#8217;ll study the effects of wave action on algal offspring and see if he can pinpoint the physics that currently drive their shape and size to get a sense of how that will change in a more acidic ocean environment.</p>
<p>Salzberg is happy to provide a platform and community where scientists can promote research, educate and engage the public, and raise money all at once. And science enthusiasts can donate to projects and be a part of exciting new discoveries, which makes them feel more invested in the outcomes of basic research.<div id="attachment_6640" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 385px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Petridish.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Petridish-e1332459143497.jpg" alt="Petridish.org" title="Petridish" width="375" height="284" class="size-full wp-image-6640" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">New Science Crowdfunding Platform Petridish.org</p></div></p>
<p>Petridish co-founder Ilia Papas says, &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to introduce a new way to help researchers fund fascinating work and give the public a way to connect with scientists!&#8221;</p>
<p>The founders acknowledge that they have no pure scientific background, but say that is deliberate because they wanted to build a community platform that allows the public to support research based on the researchers’ pitches and every user’s individual interests and concerns.</p>
<p>And it seems to be working. After launching quietly on March 6, 615 science supporters have donated just over $37,000 across 14 projects. That averages out to just about $61 per person. Donors can give any amount they want, starting at $1. And projects often give out incentive gifts for larger donations.</p>
<p>If you give $100 to Miklasz&#8217; algae project you will receive a framed algae pressing. And one lucky person who pledges $5,000 toward <a href="http://www.petridish.org/projects/new-species-of-ants-in-madagascar">Brian Fisher&#8217;s Madagascar ant project</a> will get a new ant species named in him or her honor.</p>

<p>Amelia Earhart&#8217;s disappearance has been one of the long-standing mysteries of a modern age and it has endured since the determined woman pilot vanished while trying to be the first person to fly solo around the world following the longest equatorial route. <div id="attachment_6617" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 165px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AmeliaEarhart.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AmeliaEarhart-e1332367842898.jpg" alt="Amelia Earhart, Disappeared 1937" title="AmeliaEarhart" width="155" height="200" class="size-full wp-image-6617" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Amelia Earhart, Disappeared 1937</p></div></p>
<p>But during that journey 75 years ago something happened and the pilot disappeared, sparking a big mystery that today remains unsolved.</p>
<p>A new search attempt will begin this year, supported by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and mounted by a private effort of airplane enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amelia_Earhart">Amelia Earhart</a> Secretary Clinton says, &#8220;Her legacy resonates today for anyone &#8212; girls and boys &#8212; who dreams of the stars and I do think it&#8217;s important as Americans to keep our eyes on the stars and keep our minds set on what we are able to do that keeps pushing the boundaries of human experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Clinton spoke at a press conference Tuesday announcing the expedition researchers from <a href="http://tighar.org/">The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery</a> (TIGHAR) are launching to find Earhart’s plane in the ocean off a remote island in the Pacific nation of Kiribati. </p>
<p>Former aviation accident investigator <a href="http://tighar.org/wiki/Richard_E._Gillespie">Ric Gillespie</a> founded TIGHAR and is leading the latest search for Earhart. He believes he&#8217;s solved what is one of the biggest mysteries of the 20th Century. And this time he feels confident.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6618" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/EarhartBevingtonPhoto.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/EarhartBevingtonPhoto-e1332367987842.jpg" alt="1937 Photo Taken By U.S. Navy Searchers, Red Box May Be Landing Gear" title="EarhartBevingtonPhoto" width="325" height="218" class="size-full wp-image-6618" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">1937 Photo Taken By U.S. Navy Searchers, Red Box May Be Landing Gear</p></div>Over the years he&#8217;s made nine trips to Gardner Atoll, the previous name of the South Pacific island where he believes Earhart and her navigator Fred Noonan crash landed in 1937. And more astonishing, he thinks that the pair likely survived as castaways on the island for some time, based on artifacts he found at camp sites there.</p>
<p>But what is fueling the renewed search for the lost aviator and what gets Clinton and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood excited about this new expedition is a photograph that recently underwent new photo-enhancement analysis.</p>
<p>Researchers believe that a blurry object lower left corner of the black-and-white photo taken months after Earhart disappeared shows the landing gear from an airplane protruding from the water near the remote island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikumaroro">Nikumaroro</a>. The object, which the team affectionately calls &#8220;Nessie&#8221; &#8212; after the well-circulated blurry pictures of a black object sticking out of Loch Ness in Scotland &#8212; could be a strut and wheel of a Lockheed Electra landing gear. <div id="attachment_6620" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 138px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/EarhartBevingtonPhotoNessie.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/EarhartBevingtonPhotoNessie-e1332368120925.jpg" alt="&quot;Nessie&quot; Photo Showing Enhanced Image of Possible Upside Down Landing Gear" title="EarhartBevingtonPhotoNessie" width="128" height="200" class="size-full wp-image-6620" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Nessie&quot; Photo Showing Enhanced Image of Possible Upside Down Landing Gear</p></div></p>
<p>Gillespie says, &#8220;To you and me it might just look like a blob, but to the people who do forensic imaging analysis, all the elements of the landing gear of a Lockheed Electra, the kind of plane Amelia was flying, are present.&#8221;</p>
<p>In July Gillespie will lead a team of historians, scientists and salvagers on a ten-day expedition to the island in the hope of finding the wreckage of Earhart&#8217;s plane and perhaps even her remains.</p>
<p><em>Titanic </em>discoverer  and oceanographer <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/robert-ballard/">Bob Ballard</a> is advising the team that will use state-of-the-art underwater robotic submarines and mapping equipment to look for the wreckage in a few square miles off the island’s reef. </p>
<p>He thinks the photographic evidence may be the &#8220;smoking gun&#8221; the searchers have needed to narrow the search to a certain manageable area. He says, &#8220;If you ever want a case of finding a needle in a haystack, this is at the top of the list.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_6622" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 570px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NikumaroroMap-e1332368429516.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/NikumaroroMap-e1332368764545.jpg" alt="Remote Nikumaroro Island in Kiribati, South Pacific Ocean, Amelia Earhart Search Site" title="NikumaroroMap" width="560" height="362" class="size-full wp-image-6622" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Remote Nikumaroro Island in Kiribati, South Pacific Ocean, Amelia Earhart Search Site</p></div>
<p>Earhart&#8217;s winged globe trek started in Oakland, California in May 1937. She crossed the U.S., stopping in Miami. Then, following the equatorial line she flew over South America, the Atlantic Ocean, Africa, before continuing on to India, across Southeast Asia, Australia and New Guinea. Then on July 2, she took off for Howland Island, in the remote South Pacific where she planned to re-fuel before her final leg to the United States. That&#8217;s the last anyone heard from Amelia Earhart.</p>
<p>Despite dozens of searches over decades, no one has found definitive proof of what happened. Radio distress calls, island lore and other circumstantial evidence points to Earhart and Noonan landing alive on the South Pacific atoll. But her disappearance has fueled speculation for a long, long time.</p>
<p>In a press conference announcing the new search Clinton said to the explorers, &#8220;Even if you do not find what you seek, there is great honor and possibility in the search itself. So, like our lost heroine, you will all carry our hopes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And regardless of what the privately-funded $500,000 expedition turns up, the search will be turned into a Discovery Channel documentary about the investigation into Earhart&#8217;s mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p>Some would call <a href="http://felixbaumgartner.com">Felix Baumgartner</a> crazy. Others call him fearless. Either way this high-diving sky jumper wants to break the world record for highest sky dive, currently held for over 50 years by U.S. Air Force Colonel (Retired) Joseph Kittinger. He jumped from a whopping 102,600 feet.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6606" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 231px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FelixBaumgartner4.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FelixBaumgartner4.jpg" alt="Felix Baumgartner Prepares for His Test Jump in New Mexico" title="FelixBaumgartner4" width="221" height="224" class="size-full wp-image-6606" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Felix Baumgartner Prepares for His Test Jump in New Mexico</p></div>Later this year the Austrian Baumgartner will attempt a new record of 120,000 as part of the <a href="http://www.redbullstratos.com/">Red Bull Stratos Project</a>. The high-flying star of the the energy drink brand has base jumped off the world&#8217;s tallest buildings, glided on a carbon fixed wing over the English Channel and performed other high-flying stunts.</p>
<p>But this will be his biggest and to prepare for the big dive he practiced his stratospheric leap in a practice jump from 71,581 feet on March 15.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s been planning to complete this high-altitude dive for a couple of years but it&#8217;s taken a while to iron out all the bugs associated with this kind of stunt, including a lawsuit from someone claiming to have the same idea. Even on his recent dive he noticed he could barely move his hands to open the capsule to make the jump because he was so cold.<div id="attachment_6605" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 343px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FelixBaumgartner3.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FelixBaumgartner3.jpg" alt="Wearing a Spacesuit Baumgartner Steps Out of the Capsule at 71,000 Feet" title="FelixBaumgartner3" width="333" height="500" class="size-full wp-image-6605" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Wearing a Spacesuit Baumgartner Steps Out of the Capsule at 71,000 Feet</p></div></p>
<p>The plan is to ride inside a pressurized capsule attached to a helium weather balloon and at 120,000 feet he will depressurize the capsule and step out on a ledge where he will then step into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Since the height of this record attempt is beyond the Armstrong Line &#8212; the altitude at which no one can survive a jump without oxygen and a pressure suit &#8212; Baumgartner looks more like a spaceman without a ship than a skydiver.</p>
<p>Current record-holder Kittinger has been advising the 42-year-old flying man as the team prepares for this supersonic freefall.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;What Felix is doing is proving the next generation of space suit so that when we go back into space we&#8217;ll have a better understanding than we have today and Felix will make that contribution.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once he leaves the capsule Baumgartner will plunge toward Earth at about 690 miles per hour and will probably break the sound barrier about 35 seconds into his 10-minute dive. He has enough oxygen for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>He will be wearing a special suit built to withstand temperatures of -94 degrees F, which coincidentally is the outside temperature in the stratosphere at 120,000 feet. And even in August above the New Mexico desert where the skydive will take place it will be very cold when the trained helicopter pilot steps outside and into the record books.</p>
<p>On the way down, Baumgartner is hoping to break four world records: Highest-altitude freefall, highest manned balloon flight, longest distance travelled in freefall and fastest freefall.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6601" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FelixBaumgartner1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FelixBaumgartner1-e1332345389995.jpg" alt="Baumgartner Freefalling at Supersonic Speed" title="FelixBaumgartner1" width="325" height="280" class="size-full wp-image-6601" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Baumgartner Freefalling at Supersonic Speed</p></div>He already holds the records for lowest parachute jump from the 95-foot statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, and highest jump from a building at the 1,479-foot Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
<p>Besides helping to develop the next generation of space suits, Baumgartner and the Stratos team are creating viable escape procedures for passengers and crew in space, and creating parachutes with state of the art safety systems.</p>
<p>During his big dive over Roswell, New Mexico later this year a chest pack full of equipment will record the event. A GPS unit will track his position while some telemetry equipment will capture key data. A High-Definition video camera with a 120-degree view will capture every moment of his dive.</p>
<p>The world governing body for air sports and aeronautical world records (the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale) that will ultimately verify the records Baumgartner hopes to break will also attach some equipment to his suit. An inertia measurement unit (IMU) will report Baumgartner&#8217;s altitude, pitch, angle and spin.</p>
<p>When he reaches 5,000 feet he will open a specially-designed parachute to slow his supersonic descent from beyond the speed of sound to 172 miles per hour. His chute pack also comes equipped with a smaller chute called a drogue designed especially to steady him even at mach 1.</p>
<p>And even though outer space officially begins once you cross the 62-mile mark, Baumgartner&#8217;s planned parachuted plummet from high in the sky caught NASA&#8217;s attention.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;I like to challenge myself and this is the ultimate skydive. I think there&#8217;s nothing bigger than that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Paleontologists got a brief glimpse into Earth&#8217;s tropical past when the U.S. built the Panama Canal Zone almost 100 years ago. But the scientific world didn&#8217;t know what was there until the unearthed fossils housed at the Smithsonian were studied and Frank Whitmore and Robert Stewart published the <a href="http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1244&#038;context=usgsstaffpub">first paper on Panamanian fossils</a> at the end of the 1960s.</p>
<p>At the time they determined that South America was a giant island continent with its own diverse and unusual animal life until  the isthmus of Panama grew through uplifting of tectonic plates, connecting North and South America and cutting off the Atlantic Ocean from the Pacific.<div id="attachment_6586" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 410px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AncientPanamaX.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AncientPanamaX-e1332209410380.jpg" alt="With the Discovery of Ancient Camels 20 Million Years Ago, Tectonic History Needs Revision" title="AncientPanamaX" width="400" height="240" class="size-full wp-image-6586" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">With the Discovery of Ancient Camels 20 Million Years Ago, Tectonic History Needs Revision</p></div></p>
<p>A few years ago the largest expansion of the Panama Canal began and the $5.2 billion project is giving scientists another glimpse of our tropical geological past. This time, a PhD candidate from the University of Florida unexpectedly found camel fossils while doing field excavations at the construction site in Panama.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/panama-pire/people_graduate.htm#ar">Aldo Rincon</a> found the fossils of two species of small camel that roamed the area 23 million years ago, well before North and South America were joined together. Researchers from Panama, the U.S. and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute also report finding fossils of horses and marine vertebrates, including ancient marlins and turtles. </p>
<p>Rincon says he was very excited when he took the fossil pieces back to his lab in Gainsville and began piecing them back together. He realized that he had a nearly complete camel jaw that had been nearly perfectly preserved beneath a greenish coating of volcanic ash. He says, &#8220;It&#8217;s something like Pompeii.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6587" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AldoRincon.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AldoRincon-e1332209512984.jpg" alt="University of Florida Geologist Aldo Rincon at Panama Canal Expansion Site, 2011" title="AldoRincon" width="325" height="213" class="size-full wp-image-6587" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">University of Florida Geologist Aldo Rincon at Panama Canal Expansion Site, 2011</p></div>The 33-year-old researcher was most surprised by the camel&#8217;s teeth. He says they are crocodilian and is still trying to figure out why. Other paleontologists who have been following the fossil find for a couple of years believe that modern camels have flat teeth because they eat grass. Ancient camels may have needed sharp teeth to cut into fruit and thick foliage found in the area.</p>
<p>So far five camel fossils have been recovered from the Panama Canal expansion project. Four belong to the larger species, which looked little like a modern camel. Besides having no hump, they probably only stood about three feet tall.<br />
<a href="http://www.stri.si.edu/"><br />
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute</a> biologist <a href="http://www.stri.si.edu/english/scientific_staff/staff_scientist/scientist.php?id=43">Carlos Jamarillo</a> says, &#8220;It was like a little dog.&#8221; </p>
<p>The discovery by <a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/panama-pire/">Florida Museum of Natural History</a> researchers extends the distribution of mammals to their southernmost point in the ancient tropics of Central America. The tropics are home to the world&#8217;s most important ecosystems, including rain forests that regulate climate systems and serve as a vital source of food and medicine, yet little is known of their history because lush vegetation prevents paleontological excavations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/panama-pire/people_faculty.htm#bm">Bruce MacFadden</a>, vertebrate paleontology curator at the Florida museum and co-principal investigator on the National Science Foundation grant funding the project says, &#8220;We&#8217;re discovering this fabulous new diversity of animals that lived in Central America that we didn&#8217;t even know about before.&#8221;<div id="attachment_6588" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CamelFossil1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CamelFossil1-e1332209702956.jpg" alt="Lower Jaw of Aguascalietia Panamaensis, A New Species of Ancient Camel, Courtesy of University of Florida" title="CamelFossil1" width="325" height="192" class="size-full wp-image-6588" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Lower Jaw of Aguascalietia Panamaensis, A New Species of Ancient Camel, Courtesy of University of Florida</p></div></p>
<p>Jamarillo says scientists never expected to find a camel in the canal zone. He adds, &#8220;It&#8217;s really, really a surprise.&#8221;</p>
<p>Part of the reason that it&#8217;s such a surprise is that scientists thought they had pinpointed the date that North and South America joined together. But they may be wrong, given the discovery of these mammal fossils.</p>
<p>Researchers have long thought the isthmus of Panama rose about 3.5 million years ago, but now that scientists have discovered a camel species living in the area so much earlier, that hypothesis is being questioned.</p>
<p>Before Rincon and his team found the camel fossils in Panama, no one had spotted camels south of Mexico. The camel family likely originated in Florida and Texas about 30 million years ago and spread across most of North America and changed as they migrated south.</p>
<p>A construction project near San Francisco unearthed some ancient camel bones a couple years ago that dated back 11 million years. The camels <a href="http://www.paleoresource.com/staff.htm">Josh Wyatt</a> at PaleoResource found in the Caldecott Tunnel excavation were from giant camels that he says were probably the size of giraffes. </p>
<p>Rincon made the Panamanian camel discovery over a two-year period but didn&#8217;t publish until recently. The study appears in the March 2012 issue of the <em><a href="http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.1080/02724634.2012.635736">Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</a></em>.</p>
<p>Since 2007, when the multi-year excavation project began, thousands of fossils have been recovered and sent to labs across the Americas for analysis.</p>
<p>Until the expansion project is finished and the new canal channels opened paleontologists will follow the footprint of the construction, searching for lost moments in geologic time, trying to piece together the planet&#8217;s past through the fossil record.</p>

<p>The battle over teaching evolution in biology class is still raging. Proponents of intelligent design want to import a quasi-religious teaching (many call it veiled creationism) as an alternative to Darwin&#8217;s theory of natural selection. Intelligent design is the idea that life is too complicated to have arisen through mutation, chance and evolution. Therefore, it must have been initiated by a creative, intelligent force, which many proponents identify as God. <div id="attachment_6558" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pzmyers_expelled3.thumbnail.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/pzmyers_expelled3.thumbnail-e1331941138662.jpg" alt="P.Z.

<p>Most scientific organizations, including the <a href="http://ncse.com/creationism/general/what-is-intelligent-design-creationism">National Center for Science Education</a> classify intelligent design as a religious philosophy not a scientific theory. </p>
<p>A few years ago a quasi-documentary starring former President Nixon speech writer, game show host and comedian Ben Stein stirred up debate over scientists being fired for their belief in intelligent design as a sound theory. The documentary <em><a href="http://www2.canada.com/components/print.aspx?id=f022096b-6832-4ec1-929d-92e8bc337364">Expelled </a></em>however was dismissed because as its subtitle says, &#8220;No Intelligence Allowed.&#8221; (REALscience covered the film previously, including the expulsion of <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2008/06/04/on-creationists-blogs-and-science-debates/">evolutionary biologist P.Z. Myers</a> from a screening).</p>
<p>This week, a former NASA computer specialist went to court, alleging he was first demoted and then fired for his stance on intelligent design, a belief that a higher power pushed the button of creation because life is just too complex to have developed on its own. Opening statements are supposed to begin Monday in a complicated workplace lawsuit that could reopen old evolution v. creation debates.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6555" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DavidCoppedge-e1331940744128.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DavidCoppedge-e1331940744128.jpg" alt="David Coppedge at the Los Angeles Superior Court, March 12, 2012" title="DavidCoppedge" width="275" height="337" class="size-full wp-image-6555" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">David Coppedge at the Los Angeles Superior Court, March 12, 2012</p></div><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-coppedge/30/681/a25">David Coppedge</a> was the former &#8220;team lead&#8221; on the Cassini mission exploring Saturn and its many moons. He says he was discriminated against for talking about intelligent design at work and handing out intelligent design DVDs to his coworkers. He lost his team lead title in 2009 and was let go last year after working on the Cassini mission for 15 years.</p>
<p>The organization that birthed the idea of intelligent design &#8212; Seattle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.discovery.org/">Discovery Institute</a> &#8212; is backing Coppedge in his legal battle.</p>
<p>Discovery Institute spokesman John West tells the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasas-jpl-computer-specialist-alleges-discrimination-over-his-belief-in-intelligent-design/2012/03/11/gIQAr6gg5R_story.html">Associated Press</a> that being fired for espousing intelligent design is part of a pattern of discrimination. He says, &#8220;There is basically a war on anyone who dissents from Darwin and we&#8217;ve seen that for several years. He adds that this is a free speech and freedom of conscience case.</p>
<p>The National Center for Science Education is watching the case very closely and has posted all legal filings on its website. NCSE program and policy director Josh Rosenau believes this is a pretty straightforward case of a man being laid off as a mission comes to a close.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;It would be unfortunate if the court took what seems to be a fairly straightforward employment law case and allowed it to become this tangled mess of trying to adjudicate scientific matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his lawsuit Coppedge alleges his bosses singled him out specifically because they perceived his belief in intelligent design as religious. Around NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech Coppedge had a reputation as an evangelical Christian. His case will hinge on his being persecuted for religious beliefs.</p>
<p>NASA JPL tells a different story. In court documents lawyers representing Caltech, where JPL is housed say Coppedge was given a written warning after coworkers complained he was harassing them. And they say he lost his team lead position because he had conflicts with others.</p>
<p>A professor of First Amendment law at UCLA tells the Associated Press, &#8220;The question is whether the plaintiff was fired simply because he was wasting people&#8217;s time and bothering them in ways that would have led him to being fired regardless of whether it was about religion or whether he was treated worse based on the religiosity of his beliefs.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his free time, Coppedge runs a website called <a href="http://creationsafaris.com/whycsf.htm">Creation Safaris</a> where his company puts together Bible-inspired hiking and camping trips. In his company&#8217;s description he mentions Creation Science and being a leader of a local <a href="http://www.bsa-ca.org/">Bible Science Association</a> in California where he lives.</p>
<p>From a quick Internet survey, Coppedge is a devout believer in the literal interpretation of the Bible. He says, &#8220;God’s greatest judgment on this earth was the great Flood of Noah’s day.  Now if the Bible is not just telling stories, but is revealing the true history of the world, we would expect to find evidence of this event in nature.   And that’s exactly what we do find!   All over in our travels on Creation Safaris, we see evidence for flooding and erosion on monumental scales, far more than what is happening in the world today.  This is another confirmation of the veracity of God’s word.  Seeing it with your own eyes can increase your fear of God.&#8221; <div id="attachment_6560" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DarwinsDilemma.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DarwinsDilemma-e1331941534132.jpg" alt="Film by Illustra Media, Espousing Idea of Intelligent Design" title="DarwinsDilemma" width="250" height="353" class="size-full wp-image-6560" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Film by Illustra Media, Espousing Idea of Intelligent Design</p></div></p>
<p>Coppedge looks at scientific discoveries through the lens of intelligent design. He also sits on the board of Illustra Media, a company that produces documentaries examining the scientific evidence of intelligent design, including the DVDs Coppedge gave to coworkers which landed him in trouble.</p>
<p>Coppedge is not a scientist. He maintained the computer network and solved technical problems for the Cassini mission. As &#8220;team lead&#8221; he acted as the go-between for the technicians and the managers. His suit filed in April 2010 alleges religious discrimination, retaliation and harassment. Once he lost his job he amended the suit to include wrongful termination last year.</p>
<p>In the 2008 quasi-documentary <em>Expelled</em>, other scientists alleged wrongful termination for their support of intelligent design.</p>
<p>Immunopharmacologist <a href="http://intellectualhonesty.info/">Dr. Caroline Crocker</a> lost her job at George Mason University after she gave a lecture using long since discredited creationist arguments in her biology class. She says she was let go &#8220;for teaching the problems with evolution.&#8221; George Mason University disagrees. </p>
<p>The university says she held a non-tenure track contingent faculty position and left when her contract was not renewed. The school denies she was let go for her intelligent design beliefs, as alleged in <em>Expelled</em>. Two years before the movie was released GMU spokesman Daniel Walsch told the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/03/AR2006020300822_pf.html"><em>Washington Post</em></a>, &#8220;We wholeheartedly support academic freedom.&#8221; He added, Does academic freedom &#8220;literally give you the right to talk about anything, whether it has anything to do with the subject matter or not? The answer is no.&#8221;</p>

As the editor of the journal <em><a href="http://www.pbsw.org/">Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington</a></em>, Sternberg allowed the publication of Stehen Meyer&#8217;s paper <a href="http://www.discovery.org/a/2177">The Origin of Biological Information and the Higher Taxonomic Categories</a> (now only found at the Discovery Institute website.)</p>
<p>The controversial essay appeared in the August 2004 issue of the quarterly magazine and it was Sternberg&#8217;s last issue as editor, not because he authorized the article but because he was stepping down anyway, something not illuminated in <em>Expelled</em>. A month later, the journal made a statement saying, &#8220;The paper by Stephen C. Meyer, &#8220;The origin of biological information and the higher taxonomic categories&#8221;, in vol. 117, no. 2, pp. 213-239 of the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington, was published at the discretion of the former editor, Richard v. Sternberg. Contrary to typical editorial practices, the paper was published without review by any associate editor; Sternberg handled the entire review process. The Council, which includes officers, elected councilors, and past presidents, and the associate editors would have deemed the paper inappropriate for the pages of the Proceedings because the subject matter represents such a significant departure from the nearly purely systematic content for which this journal has been known throughout its 122-year history.&#8221;</p>
<p>After his journal controversy became public Sternberg who was working as an unpaid research associate at the National Musuem of Natural History at the Smithsonian filed a religious discrimination complaint. Sternberg claims that he was &#8220;targeted for retaliation and harassment&#8221; and that several efforts were made to remove him from the museum in retaliation for his religious views and ties to intelligent design. </p>

He and presidential candidate and intelligent design advocate Rick Santorum attacked the Smithsonian&#8217;s treatment of Sternberg. Using taxpayer dollars to fund its investigation the report was written by Souder&#8217;s subcommittee staff, but published by Souder as an individual representative without it being officially accepted into the Congressional Record. The investigation was eventually dropped altogether and Sternberg left the Smithsonian. Souder resigned from Congress in 2010 after an affair with one of his part-time female staff members.</p>
<p>After leaving his volunteer position there in 2007 (but not before demanding the institution pay him <a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/50733610-Intolerance-and-the-Politicization-of-Science-at-the-Smithsonian-Souder-Sternberg-Report-Appendix-Emails.pdf">$300,000 for his trouble</a>(PDF)) Dr. Sternberg became a research fellow at the Biologic Institute of Seattle, funded by a grant from the Discovery Institute.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Behe is a professor of biochemistry at Lehigh University. While he is not barred from speaking about intelligent design, his university has issued a <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~inbios/news/evolution.htm">Biology department disclaimer</a> saying, &#8220;The department faculty, then, are unequivocal in their support of evolutionary theory, which has its roots in the seminal work of Charles Darwin and has been supported by findings accumulated over 140 years. The sole dissenter from this position, Prof. Michael Behe, is a well-known proponent of &#8220;intelligent design.&#8221; While we respect Prof. Behe&#8217;s right to express his views, they are his alone and are in no way endorsed by the department. It is our collective position that intelligent design has no basis in science, has not been tested experimentally, and should not be regarded as scientific.&#8221; <div id="attachment_6570" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 330px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MichaelBeheandBook.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MichaelBeheandBook.jpg" alt="Biochemist Michael Behe and his book, Darwin&#039;s Black Box" title="MichaelBeheandBook" width="320" height="245" class="size-full wp-image-6570" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Biochemist Michael Behe and his book, Darwin&#039;s Black Box</p></div> </p>
<p>Behe is a fellow at the Discovery Institute&#8217;s Center for Science and Culture where he reports to director Stephen Meyer. Most prominently, Behe is well known for his testimony in the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitzmiller_v._Dover_Area_School_District">Kitzmiller v. Dover</a></em> court case in Pennsylvania, which found that intelligent design was indeed based on the religious idea of creationism and therefore could not be mandated in public schools. </p>
<p>Despite his appearance in the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGCxbhGaVfE&#038;feature=player_embedded">trailer for <em>Expelled</em></a>, somehow he was left on the cutting room floor, perhaps because his continued standing as a scientist hasn&#8217;t been jeopardized by his intelligent design beliefs.</p>
<p>Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez is an assistant professor of astronomy and physics at Iowa State University was denied tenure, claiming discrimination against him for his support of intelligent design. The university said that it was because he didn&#8217;t meet the basic requirements for tenure because he published no significant papers in the seven years he was at ISU and he didn&#8217;t get any grants and only had one graduate student finish a doctoral dissertation.</p>
<p>In 2008 Gonzalez left ISU and accepted a non-tenure track job in the <a href="http://www2.gcc.edu/dept/phys/index.asp">physics department</a> at Grove City College in Pennsylvania. There he runs the astronomy program and operates the school&#8217;s observatory.</p>
<p>David Coppedge joins a long list of people complaining that their religious beliefs cost them their scientific jobs. And now it&#8217;s up to a court to determine whether NASA acted within the confines of the Constitution, which all federal institutions are bound.</p>

<p>Can you see yourself in space? Do you envision yourself traveling months or even years to explore our corner of the solar system? If so, you may want to get your eyes checked.</p>
<p>A new study of astronauts who have spent a lot of time in space on shuttle missions or at the International Space Station shows they develop eye problems after prolonged periods in weightlessness.</p>
<p>University of Texas Medical School researchers scanned the eyes of 27 astronauts who had spent at least 108 days in space. They found that many astronauts who previously had 20/20 vision required glasses. and quite a few developed blurry vision, likely caused by <a href="http://www.ihrfoundation.org/intracranial/hypertension/info/C16">intracranial hypertension</a>, a condition caused by pressure building in the skull. Twenty percent of the astronauts studied also reported a flattening of the back of the eyeball, which makes focusing more difficult.</p>
<p>Study lead author <a href="http://www.uth.tmc.edu/radiology/faculty/larry-a-kramer/index.html">Larry Kramer</a> says, &#8220;The MRI findings revealed various combinations of abnormalities following both short and long-term cumulative exposure to microgravity also seen with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6539" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AstronautJohnGrunsfeld.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AstronautJohnGrunsfeld-e1331835460457.jpg" alt="Astronaut John Grunsfeld, Spacewalking, courtesy of NASA Goddard" title="AstronautJohnGrunsfeld" width="325" height="326" class="size-full wp-image-6539" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Astronaut John Grunsfeld, Spacewalking, courtesy of NASA Goddard</p></div>In the study which was published this week in the journal <em><a href="http://radiology.rsna.org/content/early/2012/03/07/radiol.12111986.abstract">Radiology</a></em>, he says that long term space travelers may suffer serious effects including blindness.</p>
<p>For years NASA has studied bone mineral loss and temporary muscular aches in astronauts. Now it is focusing on the eye health of its spaceflyers.</p>
<p>Dr. William Tarver at NASA&#8217;s Johnson Space Center says, &#8220;NASA has placed this problem high on its list of human risks, has initiated a comprehensive program to study its mechanisms and implications, and will continue to closely monitor the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few astronauts who developed eye problems were told returning to space might permanently damage their vision. And weak vision has even cost a couple astronauts their private pilot licenses. When this astronaut vision problem became visible last year, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/space-station-astronauts-eyesight-affected-long-stays-orbit/story?id=15904338#.T2IcDs5W2So">ABC News</a> talked to former astronaut Peggy Whitson who said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve known about vision changes on orbit but in some cases we&#8217;ve actually found that it can be permanent.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The question remains what does this mean for flights to Mars or beyond? Dr. Kramer isn&#8217;t sure and that&#8217;s why he wants to study this more closely.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;At this point we&#8217;re just raising the issue but once you&#8217;re headed to Mars, there&#8217;s no turning back.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Earth our bodies are oriented with gravity in mind. That is why our hearts pumps to prevent blood and other fluids from pooling in our legs. In microgravity, there is no force to counteract the pumping, so fluids get pushed upward without a way to pull them back down. Astronauts report a feeling of full headedness. On short flights astronauts use tabasco sauce and horseradish to help clear out their sinuses.</p>
<p>In the study 60 percent of the astronaut subjects reported some eye problem. Some were reversible and others may be permanent. This has immediate implications for the US space program since ending the shuttle program last year all spaceflights are multi-month missions to the International Space Station aboard a Russian Soyuz capsule. And all long term space exploration involves long range targets, whether Mars or a large asteroid.</p>
<p>Russian cosmonaut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Lebedev">Valentin Lebedev</a> lost his eyesight to progressive cataracts. He blamed excessive radiation for his eye problem, after spending 221 days orbiting Earth in 1982. He says, &#8220;It was all concealed back then, during the Soviet years, but now I can say that I caused damage to my health because of that flight.</p>
<p>According to one NASA survey of about 300 astronauts, nearly 30 percent of those who have flown on space shuttle missions – which usually lasted two weeks &#8212; and 60 percent who&#8217;ve completed six-month shifts aboard the station reported a gradual blurring of eyesight. But 40 percent of astronauts experienced no eye problems whatsoever, which puzzles Kramer and his team.</p>
<p>NASA&#8217;s Chief Health and Medical Officer says, &#8220;This [eye problem] is comparable to the other risks like bone demineralization and radiation that we have to consider. Dr. Rich Williams says, &#8220;It does have the potential for causing mission impact.&#8221;</p>
<p>So before you purchase a $200,000 ticket to the edge of space on <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/">Virgin Galactic</a> next year, start counting how much time you are spending in a weightless environment. This research shows that symptoms associated with intracranial hypertension can begin after just 30 days in space or other microgravity.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drought resistant corn is coming soon. It&#8217;s the latest transgenic offering from the Monsanto seed company. After the US Department of Agriculture chose not to regulate DroughtGard, a new species of genetically engineered corn late last year it means the new crop will move from its current test phase into commercialization this year.<div id="attachment_6522" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MonsantoDroughtGardcorn.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MonsantoDroughtGardcorn-e1331766312607.jpg" alt="DroughtGard Corn from Monsanto, courtesy of Monsanto" title="MonsantoDroughtGardcorn" width="325" height="213" class="size-full wp-image-6522" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">DroughtGard Corn from Monsanto, courtesy of Monsanto</p></div></p>
<p>But what&#8217;s in the corn that makes it more resistant to drought? It&#8217;s a gene called <a href="http://www.jbc.org/content/276/18/15511.full.pdf">cold shock protein B</a> or cspB that comes from a common bacteria. It is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacillus_subtilis"><em>Bacillus subtilis</em></a> bacteria, also known as hay or grass bacillus, commonly found in soil. The gene facilitates protein function. The seed giant also added a second foreign gene that codes for antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>According to Monsanto in the case of corn, &#8220;CspB works by helping the plant maintain growth and development during times of inadequate water supply. A corn plant is particularly vulnerable to drought during reproductive growth stages. By mitigating the impact of drought on the plant, cspB helps provide yield stability.  Improved yield stability is of significant value to farmers faced with unpredictable rainfall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Monsanto worked with European chemical company BASF to develop the first biotechnology-derived drought-tolerant crop in the world. They made the initial discovery in 2009 but it&#8217;s taken several years of regulatory scrutiny and testing to bring it to the farmers in drought-stricken parts of the U.S.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/Biotechnology/Submissions/ucm240080.htm">2010 biotechnology note</a> the FDA, which regulates food additives, said, &#8220;Monsanto describes the <em>CSPB </em>protein produced in corn event MON 87460 as identical to the native <em>CSPB </em>protein produced in <em>B. subtilis</em> except for one amino acid introduced for cloning purposes. Bacterial cold shock proteins (CSP) are hypothesized to function by binding to RNA secondary structures, thus reducing the free energy required for unfolding misfolded RNA. CSPs are classified as RNA chaperones. Monsanto notes that similar cold shock domain-containing proteins are also present in plants where they appear to play a role in conferring stress tolerance.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_6523" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 570px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MonsantoDroughtGardProcess.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MonsantoDroughtGardProcess-e1331766370308.jpg" alt="CsbB Protein at Work in Monsanto Genetically Modified Corn" title="MonsantoDroughtGardProcess" width="560" height="296" class="size-full wp-image-6523" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">CsbB Protein at Work in Monsanto Genetically Modified Corn, courtesy of Monsanto</p></div>
<p>The FDA noted that Monsanto found several <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peptide">polypeptides </a>containing at least 8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid">amino acids</a> that could express proteins. The company ran those sequences against databases of any known toxins or allergens and found they didn&#8217;t match any. Then the FDA reports that it tested both bacillus subtilis and the <em>cspB </em>protein for safety and toxicity. </p>
<p>Previous research shows that <em>b. subtilis</em> is commonly used as a food additive with no deleterious effects, thus answering the safety question. And additional research shows that the <em>cspB </em>protein bears no similarity to proteins known to be toxic or bioactive.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the agency, Susan Carlson said, &#8220;Based on the information provided by the company and other information available to the agency, FDA did not identify any issues under Sections 402 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act that would require further evaluation at this time.&#8221; She felt that Monsanto had satisfied their obligation to determine if its intended genetic modification of corn posed any risk. </p>
<p>Before the FDA gave its approval for Monsanto to move forward with its testing and commercialization of drought-resistant corn, Dr. Shenaz Moola from the African Centre for Biosafety <a href="http://www.biosafety-info.net/file_dir/3328765124be3c9f5ce3da.pdf">raised a few objections</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Inserted gene sequences may interrupt native gene sequences and/or their promoters and additional code fragments are not necessarily non-functional and may be transcribed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He cites Monsanto&#8217;s product Roundup Ready Soy which was supposed to have gene fragments that were &#8220;non-functional and not-transcribed.&#8221; Later they were found to <a href="http://www.genengnews.com/gen-articles/point-of-view-genetically-modified-foods-unsafe-evidence-that-links-gm-foods-to-allergic-respo/2252/">transcribe and produce RNA</a>. He says, &#8220;Unintended effects that are not detected in the lab and that may only become apparent in the long term cannot be ruled out.&#8221;</p>
<p>The antibiotic resistance marker gene <em>nptII</em> from <em>E.coli</em> is also part of the drought-resistant corn DNA. That gene codes for an enzyme that makes the organism (in this case the corn) resistant to three common families of antibiotics.</p>
<p>Dr. Moola doesn&#8217;t know why Monsanto and BASF even put that gene into the drought-resistant corn. He says, &#8220;In the development of MON 87460 [drought-resistant corn], the residual <em>nptII </em>gene is gratuitous especially since it is bordered by <em>loxP </em>sites and thus could have been removed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.efsa.europa.eu/fr/scdocs/doc/1108.pdf">European Food Safety Authority</a> statement (PDF) Monsanto says its antibiotic resistance markers have &#8220;no adverse effects on human health and the environment.</p>
<p>Not everyone agrees.</p>
<p>Two senior members of the EFSA’s biohazard panel that reviewed Monsanto&#8217;s application for use of drought-tolerant corn say, &#8220;adverse effects cannot be assessed&#8221; and the probability of gene transfers from plants to bacteria ranges widely &#8220;from unlikely to high.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Moola says the evolution of antibiotic resistance is a clear indicator of gene transfer frequency, since antibiotics have been used in medicine for about 50 years. He is concerned about horizontal gene transfer where genes transfer genetic material between organisms, outside the context of parent to offspring reproduction. Most of the time it is performed through infectious transfer where the genetic material is transported by a bacteria or virus.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;The intentional modification of plants could through horizontal gene transfer result in the unintentional modification of other organisms.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is already widely seen in pollination events where genetically modified plants are interbreeding with non-GMOs.<div id="attachment_6525" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MonsantoDroughtGardmap.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MonsantoDroughtGardmap-e1331766622930.jpg" alt="DroughtGard Field Test Map, 2010, courtesy of Monsanto" title="MonsantoDroughtGardmap" width="325" height="205" class="size-full wp-image-6525" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">DroughtGard Field Test Map, 2010, courtesy of Monsanto</p></div></p>
<p>But the new DroughtGard variety of corn is already in the ground. For the last three years over 200 test sites throughout the Midwest have been planting the transgenic corn next to unmodified corn to measure the difference. </p>
<p>During its testing phase Monsanto has shifted its effort from a drought-resistant variety ideal for the parched Earth of Africa to a drought-tolerant variety that just boosts yields a bit under stressed water conditions.</p>
<p>And for the last couple of years the corn belt in Kansas and Nebraska have feel the full force of drought conditions as corn yields dropped under unusually dry conditions. During these times the DroughtGard corn performed well compared to non-GMO corn.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="http://www.fao.org/emergencies/what-we-do/hazard-and-emergency-types/drought/en/">United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization</a> report prepared for ministers of the G-8, the number and duration of dry spells, especially in already drought-prone areas, is expected to increase.</p>
<p>Monsanto and its line of drought-resistant crops is banking on that. Over the next ten years it hopes to roll out a series of genetically modified plants that will all have foreign genes inserted into the seed&#8217;s DNA to make it more drought tolerant and make the company an additional $300 million to $500 million a year.</p>
<p>In December when the FDA decided not to regulate the new Monsanto corn variety, it marked the first time the US Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service approved a product that is genetically modified to resist drought, instead of a pest or fertilizer.</p>
<p>The agency concluded that the corn is is unlikely to harm the environment, people or animals and wouldn&#8217;t boost corn production at the expense of grasslands and forest.<br />
<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/news/experts/doug-gurian-sherman.html"><br />
Doug Gurian-Sherman</a> from the Union of Concerned Scientists&#8217; Food and Environment Program says, &#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to think the corn might be unsafe.&#8221; But he and <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/about/staff-bios/">Bill Freese</a> at the Center for Food Safety wish there were more stringent testing and regulation of crops produced with biotechnology.</p>

<p>For the last seven years famed film director <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/the-team/james-cameron/">James Cameron</a> has been working to build a tiny submarine capable of exploring the deepest reaches of the ocean. Later this month, the blockbuster creator of <em>Titanic</em>, <em>The Abyss</em> and <em>Avatar </em>will venture where only two men have gone before.</p>
<p>In preparing for his deep-sea dive last week, Cameron, who is an <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/explorers/bios/james-cameron/">explorer in residence</a> at the National Geographic Society set a new world depth record as he descended 5.1 miles. He beat the old record for modern vehicles previously held by a Japanese submersible by over a mile. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_6500" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DeepseaChallenger1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DeepseaChallenger1.jpg" alt="Deepsea Challenger Bobs on Surface during Final Checks" title="DeepseaChallenger1" width="250" height="595" class="size-full wp-image-6500" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Deepsea Challenger Bobs on Surface during Final Checks</p></div>After returning from his test dive in the New Britain Trench in the Solomon Sea near Papua New Guinea, he wrote an <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/latest-news/cameron-to-walsh-on-record-8k-dive-youd-have-loved-it/">email to Don Walsh</a>, one of the original men who landed briefly at the bottom of the Challenger Deep 50 years ago. </p>
<p>Cameron describes his surroundings 26,791 feet underwater. He says, &#8220;The ponded sediment in the center of the trench was the finest I’ve ever seen. When the thrust-wash just barely kissed it, it formed silken veils undulating across the bottom, and then it would rise and hang in tendrils like ectoplasm. Not at all like the typical turbidite plains of abyssal depths. Where I dove the basin of ponded sediment was 1.5 km across, flat as a billiard table, and virtually featureless. It actually ended at a well-defined &#8216;beach&#8217; where the normal rocks and sediment commenced, terracing upward to the fault scarps. I explored up the scarps onto a plateau.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s ready to go deeper. Driven by pure curiosity the six-foot-two inch man will fold himself into the one-man sub and plunge seven miles to the Challenger Deep located in the Mariana Trench in the South Pacific. 57-year-old director Cameron hopes this expedition will help answer some basic scientific questions about ocean trenches, like whether fish can live there. So far no deep sea camera has captured one swimming around.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;We&#8217;re gonna go down there with our cameras, our lights, and find the answers to some of those questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many fans of Cameron&#8217;s movies are critical of this flight of fancy and would rather have him working on his next film than exploring the ocean. </p>
<p>Adam Chitwood at <a href="http://collider.com/james-cameron-deepest-challenge/150955/">Collider.com</a> says, &#8220;When you’re James Cameron, you get to do pretty much whatever you want. That’s why instead of working away like a madman on Avatar 2 and 3 in order to meet a studio deadline, Cameron is out doing fun, hobby stuff like trying to reach the ocean’s deepest point; you know, for giggles.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Cameron is fulfilling a boyhood dream and he is pushing science and exploration at the same time. He says, &#8220;So little is known about these deep places that I knew I would see things no human has ever seen.&#8221; And the alien creatures he will surely film will likely inspire a new generation of movies.<div id="attachment_6502" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DeepseaChallengerCameron.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DeepseaChallengerCameron-e1331673252495.jpg" alt="James Cameron and Crew in Front of Deepsea Challenger" title="DeepseaChallengerCameron" width="325" height="243" class="size-full wp-image-6502" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">James Cameron and Crew in Front of Deepsea Challenger</p></div></p>
<p>The only way to make his dream a reality was to build a new type of submersible vehicle unlike anything that was available. And Cameron is no stranger to submarines. He&#8217;s been on 72 dives, 51 of which were in Russian <em>Mir </em>subs to depths of up to 16,000 feet. And he&#8217;s visited the final resting place of the <em>Titanic </em>33 times.</p>
<p>Over the last seven years he has been working on his new sub design, which he built secretly in Australia. Cameron is emerging as one of a handful of wealthy entrepreneurs who are helping to push scientific exploration forward.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2011/04/06/billionaire-branson-heads-for-murky-depths/">British billionaire Richard Branson</a> launched his own submersible company, called Virgin Oceanic. Part of that underwater airline involves deep sea dives to the five of the most inaccessible spots on Earth. </p>
<p>Even though there is no real competition afoot, both Branson and Cameron would like to be the first to return to the bottom of the ocean after a 52-year hiatus.</p>
<p>Science is the binder for both of these projects. And <a href="http://www.sio.ucsd.edu/Profile/dbartlett">Douglas Bartlett</a>, a professor of marine microbial genetics at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California San Diego is the glue that holds the science together for both expeditions.</p>
<p>While Cameron will film his entire deep sea experience on the ocean floor 36,000 below the surface, he will also be collecting water and marine life samples which will get turned over to Dr. Bartlett who has become a global expert on deep sea life.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6506" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 285px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/xenophyophore.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/xenophyophore-e1331673946635.jpg" alt="Xenophyophore, Large Single-Celled Protist in Deep Ocean" title="xenophyophore" width="275" height="206" class="size-full wp-image-6506" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Xenophyophore, Large Single-Celled Protist in Deep Ocean</p></div>Last year, the marine biologist dropped cameras into the Mariana trench and <a href="http://scrippsnews.ucsd.edu/Releases/?releaseID=1206">discovered fist-sized amoebas</a>, single-celled creatures found only in deep oceans but not expected at that depth. Called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophyophore">xenophyophores</a>, studies indicate that by trapping particles from the water, these creatures can concentrate high levels of lead, uranium and mercury and are thus likely resistant to large doses of heavy metals. They also are well suited to a life of darkness, low temperature and high pressure in the deep sea.</p>
<p>Bartlett says, &#8220;The identification of these gigantic cells in one of the deepest marine environments on the planet opens up a whole new habitat for further study of biodiversity, biotechnological potential and extreme environment adaptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there are more than giant amoebas in the deep ocean. Bartlett is also part of the science team on <a href="http://www.virginoceanic.com/">Branson&#8217;s Challenger project</a> to dive the deepest parts of the world&#8217;s five oceans. First stop, the Mariana Trench.</p>
<p>The $15 million project will give researchers at Scripps and elsewhere an unprecedented peek into the least accessible waters on Earth. Bartlett says, &#8220;It’s just going to be an incredible resource for looking at life in this extreme environment.&#8221;<div id="attachment_6504" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/virginoceanicWelshandBranson.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/virginoceanicWelshandBranson-e1331673700772.jpg" alt="Chris Welsh and Sir Richard Branson Sit atop Virgin Oceanic&#039;s Challenger, April 2011" title="To the Deepest Depths with Virgin Oceanic" width="325" height="203" class="size-full wp-image-6504" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Chris Welsh and Sir Richard Branson Sit atop Virgin Oceanic&#039;s Challenger, April 2011</p></div></p>
<p>Virgin Oceanic&#8217;s Challenger idea began years ago when adventurer Steve Fossett was setting sailing records with his 125-foot catamaran <em>PlayStation</em>. Eddie Kisfaludy, Virgin Oceanic’s operations manager says Fossett &#8220;was having this sub built to go down to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fossett converted his catamaran into a research yacht, complete with a crane that could lift a sub out of the water and into a cradle on a center deck. He also commissioned a sub but died in 2007 before completing the project. Newport Beach real estate investor <a href="http://www.virginoceanic.com/team/operations-team/#chriswelsh">Chris Welsh</a> shared Fossett&#8217;s passion for adventure so he bought Fossett&#8217;s catamaran and came up with the idea to dive five oceans.</p>
<p>He partnered with Branson and together the two adventurers are funding the whole project, with a little help from <a href="http://www.virginoceanic.com/sponsors/">sponsors </a>listed on the website.</p>
<p>Welsh says, &#8220;I just sort of sat back and looked at what could be done, and going to the deepest places in each of the five oceans kind of bubbled to the top.&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6509" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 210px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DougBartlett.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/DougBartlett.jpg" alt="Deepsea Challenge and Challenger Expeditions Science Team Member Douglas Bartlett" title="DougBartlett" width="200" height="300" class="size-full wp-image-6509" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Deepsea Challenge and Challenger Expeditions Science Team Member Douglas Bartlett</p></div>And Doug Bartlett will be a big beneficiary of that decision. He plans to use remotely operated robots to collect water, sediment and life-form samples from the trenches in conjunction with all <a href="http://www.virginoceanic.com/mission/dives/">five Challenger dives</a>. The landers are untethered robots that will carry a bunch of scientific instruments to the seafloor. While the sub is busy shooting video with high-definition cameras illuminating the depths with powerful lights, the robots will be busy sampling the depths for science.  </p>
<p>Welsh plans to pilot the first of five dives himself later this year. Currently, the Branson team is testing the fitness of the flying sub off the coast of California ahead of its maiden voyage to the Mariana Trench.</p>
<p>After each of the five Challenger dives scientists will look at everything from the geology and chemistry of the area. They will analyze the types of simple organisms that survive in extreme environments and they may even find answers to all sorts of biological riddles.</p>
<p>Cameron&#8217;s <a href="http://deepseachallenge.com/">Deepsea Challenge</a> expedition seven miles down wouldn&#8217;t be complete without filming something. National Geographic says he&#8217;ll be at the bottom of the ocean shooting his environment in high-definition 3D video for up to 6 hours.</p>
<p>The last dive to these depths lasted only 20 minutes and no images were captured. A window cracked in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathyscaphe_Trieste">US Navy sub <em>Trieste</a> </em>on the way down. The landing stirred up so much ooze that the divers could see little through the portholes, took no pictures and Don Walsh and Jacques Piccard began their ascent after just 20 minutes on the seabed. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/science/earth/james-cameron-prepares-to-dive-into-mariana-trench.html">New York Times</a> says, &#8220;As with the birth of the private space rocket industry, where commercial companies are building ships to take astronauts aloft, the debut of Mr. Cameron’s submarine signals the rising importance of entrepreneurs in the global race to advance science and technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>And it signals a commitment to learning about our planet&#8217;s innerspace &#8212; the deep ocean. According to the Cameron&#8217;s expedition website, &#8220;Its mission will be one of scientific exploration and discovery, part of an expedition that will help scientists study alien ecosystems and the tectonic forces that help shape Earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>And according to those close to the project, the big dive will take place later this month.</p>

<p>James Hansen looks more like an Amish farmer these days &#8212; sporting a chin curtain beard, button-down white shirt and hat &#8212; than a scientist. At least that&#8217;s how the renowned climate expert appeared at the end of February, as he delivered a dire message to a room full of movers and shakers at the 2012 TED Conference in Long Beach.<div id="attachment_6474" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansenNASAmissionstatement.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansenNASAmissionstatement-e1331602157562.jpg" alt="NASA Dropped &quot;To Understand and Protect The Home Planet&quot; from Its Mission Statement in February, 2006" title="JamesHansenNASAmissionstatement" width="325" height="229" class="size-full wp-image-6474" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">NASA Dropped &quot;To Understand and Protect The Home Planet&quot; from Its Mission Statement in February, 2006</p></div></p>
<p>The outspoken physicist used to justify his advocacy for planet Earth as part of NASAs mission statement, which stated in its first line, &#8220;To understand and protect the home planet.&#8221; But that was before NASA dropped that piece in 2006, largely because of Dr. Hansen.</p>
<p>Dr. Hansen runs the <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/">NASA Goddard Institute for Space Sciences</a> in New York. But he started out studying Venus under James Van Allen, for whom the Van Allen radiation belts are named. As a young scientist Hansen focused his research on understanding the atmosphere of Venus. By helping NASA build an instrument to study our neighboring planet, Hansen helped confirm that Venus is hot &#8212; about 860 degrees F on the surface &#8212; and is surrounded by a smoggy atmosphere of sulfuric acid.</p>
<p>In the 1960s and 1970s he published several papers about the Venutian atmosphere, postulating that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet and preventing it from radiating back to space. Essentially, Hansen was describing the greenhouse effect on Venus. While the Pioneer Venus Project was still being planned, Hansen started looking at the greenhouse effect here on Earth because scientists realized that the atmospheric composition was changing.</p>
<p>Hansen says he resigned from the Venus experiment &#8220;because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important.&#8221;</p>
<p>He immediately recognized that changes in the composition of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere will affect all of humanity. By the late 1970s the greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century after first having been discovered by British physicist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tyndall">John Tyndall</a> in the 1850s. Tyndall measured infrared radiation, which is heat. And in laboratory tests he showed that gases such as carbon dioxide absorbed heat, as Hansen says, &#8220;thus acting like a blanket warming Earth&#8217;s surface.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he began looking at the temperature record of Earth and found that over the previous century (from 1880-1980) the world had warmed by 0.4 degrees Celsius. And that was enough to show that the greenhouse effect was already in effect.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6478" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansen1981ScienceArticle-e1331605743294.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansen1981ScienceArticle-e1331605743294.jpg" alt="Hansen, et al. Publish Critical Climate Change Study in 1981" title="JamesHansen1981ScienceArticle" width="325" height="203" class="size-full wp-image-6478" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Hansen, et al. Publish Critical Climate Change Study in 1981</p></div>In August 1981, Hansen and six co-authors published a paper in <em>Science </em> entitled <em><a href="http://www.atmos.washington.edu/2009Q1/111/Readings/Hansen1981_CO2_Impact.pdf">Climate Impact of Increasing Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide</a> (PDF)</em>. It made the following predictions:</p>
<p>1. Earth would likely warm in the 1980s<br />
2. Warming would exceed the random noise level of random weather by the end of the century<br />
3. The 21st Century would see shifting climate zones, creation of drought-prone regions in North America and Asia, erosion of ice sheets, rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage</p>
<p>In 2012 Hansen says, &#8220;All of these impacts have since happened or are now well underway.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that is still not why he is so adamant about getting people to recognize the importance of climate change. After over 40 years of studying the climate and understanding the physics of the atmosphere as well as anyone can, he is driven to speak out in an uncharacteristically vocal way because he looks at his grandchildren and says he can&#8217;t imagine knowing what he knows and not sharing that crucial information clearly with everyone he encounters. </p>
<p>In 1988 he testified before Congress where he talked about global warming increasing both extremes of the Earth&#8217;s water cycle. He said a warming world would experience heat waves and droughts directly from the increased warming. But he also warned that since a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor there would also be more intense storms and flooding.<div id="attachment_6480" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 312px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansen3.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansen3.jpg" alt="James Hansen Addresses TED Conference, February 2012" title="JamesHansen3" width="302" height="346" class="size-full wp-image-6480" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">James Hansen Addresses TED Conference, February 2012</p></div></p>
<p>Fast-forward 15 years. Hansen and his colleagues have more evidence than ever that the planet is warming and could reach a tipping point where reversing the effects will be impossible. He began engaging politicians &#8212; most notably President George W. Bush&#8217;s administration, twice. </p>
<p>He says, &#8220;By then most of the things we mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts but energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels.&#8221;</p>
<p>After being censored by the White House and causing NASA to drop the first part of its own mission statement Hansen, the quiet Midwestern physicist was thrust into the spotlight and began talking not about physics but about energy policy. He was still studying the science but physics wasn&#8217;t as provocative as the controversy surrounding the hot-button issue of global warming.</p>
<p>At the TED Talk in February, Hansen says the most important piece of science he learned during the last decade is about Earth&#8217;s energy imbalance.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed. It reduces Earth&#8217;s heat radiation to space so there is a temporary energy imbalance. More energy is coming in than going out until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the sun.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the big climate physics question revolves around Earth&#8217;s energy imbalance. Is there more energy coming in than going out? If so, then more warming is already in the pipeline and the process will continue without adding any additional greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>After decades of speculation Hansen says science &#8220;can finally measure Earth&#8217;s energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth&#8217;s heat reservoirs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of the excess heat that can&#8217;t escape back to space gets absorbed in the ocean at three levels, the upper ocean, the deep southern ocean and the abyssal ocean. Ice melt and ground warming make up the rest of the heat reservoirs.</p>
<p>Over the last ten years scientists have been racing to understand the role the ocean plays in global warming. Now Hansen has discovered that the upper ocean accounted for 71 percent of the energy imbalance. That means 71 percent of the heat is going right into the ocean, warming the surface, raising sea level and changing the chemistry. By 2006 3,000 floats covering most of the world&#8217;s oceans began collecting temperature and other data. In 2011, <a href="http://www.euro-argo.eu/layout/set/print/Main-Achievements/European-Contributions/Science/Global-Scales/Global-Ocean-Indicators-von-Schuckmann-et-al">Karina von Schuckmann and Pierre-Yves Le Traon</a> estimated that between 2005 and 2010 the world ocean gained energy at a rate 0.41 W/m2 averaged over the planet.</p>
<p>That put a big missing piece of the climate puzzle in place.</p>
<p>Hansen says, &#8220;The total energy imbalance right now is about 0.6 of a watt per square meter.&#8221; He says that may not sound like a lot but when added together it is about 20 times greater than the amount of energy used by everyone on Earth. It&#8217;s equivalent to exploding 400,000 Hiroshima-style atomic bombs per day, 365 days per year. Hansen says, &#8220;That&#8217;s how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Based on his calculations, Hansen holds firm to his previous recommendation that we need to reduce CO2 levels to 350 parts per million from today&#8217;s 391 ppm. He says, &#8220;That is the chance to restore energy balance and prevent further warming.&#8221;</p>
<div id="attachment_6482" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 487px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansenIceCoreData.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansenIceCoreData.jpg" alt="800,000 Years of Ice Core Data from Antarctica" title="JamesHansenIceCoreData" width="477" height="345" class="size-full wp-image-6482" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">800,000 Years of Ice Core Data from Antarctica</p></div>
<p>Looking back to the history of our planet scientists see fluctuations in temperature, carbon dioxide levels and sea levels. They shift as the orbit of Earth around the sun shifts. Hansen says these <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles">natural cycles</a> that begin with very small orbital changes, which affect how much sun reaches Earth&#8217;s surface, cause planet-wide climate change.  </p>
<p>The same thing happened on Venus. Scientists now with a better understanding of the planet thanks the work of James Hansen note that Venus was probably very similar to Earth billions of years ago. It likely had a water and rock surface, much cooler surface temperatures and a more breathable atmosphere. But a runaway greenhouse effect caused by the evaporation of that original water probably generated a critical level of greenhouse gases in its atmosphere, warming the planet to its current levels.</p>
<p>Now human action has perturbed Earth&#8217;s climate outside of its natural state. And Hansen (along with many other scientists) are concerned that if things continue in a business-as-usual fashion, Earth is heading for an energy imbalance that would create runaway global warming.</p>
<p>Because the world hasn&#8217;t come together to solve this planetary crisis, Hansen says, &#8220;Clearly I haven&#8217;t got this message across. The science is clear. I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions. More effectively, we owe it to our children and grandchildren.&#8221;<div id="attachment_6481" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 235px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansenArrest2011-e1331605577334.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansenArrest2011-e1331605577334.jpg" alt="James Hansen Arrested in Front of White House, 2011" title="JamesHansenArrest2011" width="225" height="337" class="size-full wp-image-6481" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">James Hansen Arrested in Front of White House, 2011</p></div></p>
<p>He says, &#8220;The phsyics doesn&#8217;t change. As Earth warms now from extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere, ice will melt and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost.&#8221;</p>
<p>These are the climate feedback loops that Hansen worries about most. While he says no one can be certain when these amplifying feedbacks will happen, he says, &#8220;We can be certain that they will occur unless we stop the warming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Like all climate scientists Hansen says that global warming can&#8217;t be attributed to a single event. But over time the frequency of such events can be linked to climate change. </p>
<p>Hansen says that global warming is already affecting people. He points to the Texas, Oklahoma, Mexico drought last year, Moscow the year before and the widespread heat wave in Europe in 2003. He calls them exceptional events. To qualify as exceptional an event it must be more than three standard deviations outside the norm.</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;Fifty years ago, such anomalies covered 2-3 tenths of one percent of land area. In recent years, because of global warming, they now cover about ten percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>That big jump, by a factor of 25-50, allows Hansen and others to say with a great degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heat waves are not natural. He says, &#8220;They were caused by global warming.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a physicist who has studied the problem for a long time Hansen believes he&#8217;s come up with a suitable solution. He says placing a rising carbon fee on fossil fuels is a &#8220;simple and honest approach.&#8221;</p>
<p>He says, &#8220;It would be immoral to leave young people with a climate system spiraling out of control.&#8221; His plan calls for a fee collected from fossil fuel companies with of the proceeds given to citizens on a monthly basis. His hope is that new money would increase jobs, spur innovation and make clean energy sources more affordable. He wants the system automated so 100 percent of the carbon money gets transferred &#8220;electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis with the government not keeping one dime.&#8221;</p>
<p>The energy policy of the U.S. and much of the world externalizes the true cost of fossil fuels. That&#8217;s what prompts Hansen to sound the alarm. The quiet scientist was arrested last year for protesting outside the White House. He is so determined to get the public to embrace the serious nature of climate change that he spends his vacation time speaking to audiences around the world and raising awareness about our climate&#8217;s precarious situation.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6472" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 291px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansenTED-e1331602082906.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JamesHansenTED-e1331602082906.jpg" alt="James Hansen at TED 2012" title="JamesHansenTED" width="281" height="194" class="size-full wp-image-6472" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">James Hansen at TED 2012</p></div>With his carbon fee and dividend solution Hansen says fossil fuel companies must stop relying on the public to subsidize their use. Right now, he estimates the subsidy amounts to about $400-$500 billion per year worldwide. That, he says only encourages further extraction of every remaining fuel source, including mountain top removal, long wall mining, fracking, tar sands, tar shale, deep ocean and Arctic drilling.</p>
<p>According to his figures if we had started in 2005 we could have restored Earth&#8217;s energy balance and stabilized the climate during the 21st Century with only three percent emissions reduction per year. If we start next year, we would need to reduce emissions six percent per year to prevent runaway warming. And if we wait another ten years we would need to reduce emissions drastically by 15 percent per year. At that point Hansen says it would be extremely difficult and expensive and perhaps impossible. </p>
<p>He says, &#8220;The longer we wait the more expensive and difficult it becomes. And we aren&#8217;t even starting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite what some people may think 19-year-old <a href="http://www.mileycyrus.com/">Miley Cyrus</a> is not a robot. She even has a song about it. Though this week the teen rock star upset many of her most ardent fans who are also religious conservatives when she posted a picture on a social network.</p>
<p>Normally, that type of celebrity behavior wouldn&#8217;t raise eyebrows. But Cyrus posted a picture of theoretical physicist <a href="http://krauss.faculty.asu.edu/">Lawrence Krauss</a> embedded with his quote: &#8220;You are all stardust. You couldn’t be here if stars hadn’t exploded, because the elements (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, all the things that matter for evolution) weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in stars. So forget Jesus. Stars died so you can live.&#8221;<div id="attachment_6451" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 570px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LawrenceKraussMileyCyrus.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/LawrenceKraussMileyCyrus.jpg" alt="Miley Cyrus Twitpic of Lawrence Krauss with His Quote" title="LawrenceKraussMileyCyrus" width="560" height="373" class="size-full wp-image-6451" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Miley Cyrus Twitpic of Lawrence Krauss with His Quote</p></div></p>
<p>To the photo, she added her own comment, &#8220;Beautiful.&#8221; That seeming endorsement of the Big Bang theory began a war of words where some of her fans in an unchristian fashion attacked the pop star for her belief in the beginning of the universe.</p>
<p>They clearly took issue with the &#8220;So forget Jesus&#8221; line of Krauss&#8217; quote.</p>
<p>This week she returned to Twitter saying, &#8220;How can people take the love out of science and bring hate into religion so easily? It makes me sad to think the world is this way. Like Einstein says: &#8216;Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6453" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 186px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MileyCyrus2.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MileyCyrus2-e1331327689160.jpg" alt="Miley Cyrus Sings &quot;Robot&quot;" title="MileyCyrus2" width="176" height="247" class="size-full wp-image-6453" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Miley Cyrus Sings &quot;Robot&quot;</p></div>As a child star who grew up in the spotlight of her achy-breaky father Billy Ray Cyrus, young Miley used to attend church and even wore a purity ring as a sign of her Christian faith. Naturally the Disney megastar grew a like-minded following.</p>
<p>Now that the singer is a young adult, some of her growing pains are creating conflict. But as she says in her song Robot, &#8220;Stop telling me I&#8217;m part of a big machine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right after the backlash began <a href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/03/06/miley-cyrus-religious-tweets-anti-christian-tweets/">Hollywood Life</a> editor Bonnie Fuller came to the teen&#8217;s defense. She says, &#8220;Miley, we’re so proud of you for standing up in your new tweets about your beliefs that the world was created through evolution, even though you were attacked by some livid fans!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, the quote more refers to the Big Bang creating the universe not evolution but Fuller means well despite her scientific naivete. So we&#8217;ll give her a pass for now.</p>
<p>In a poll on the same site, Fuller reports that 57 percent didn&#8217;t think Cyrus&#8217; Twitpic of Krauss was offensive.</p>
<p>But many die-hard fans are ready to take away her Southern Baptist card and some even told her to go to Hell. Again, not very Christian of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MileyCyrus4.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MileyCyrus4.jpg" alt="Miley Cyrus Tweets" title="MileyCyrus4" width="522" height="158" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6461" /></a></p>
<p>One online supporter says, &#8220;I believe in God, the big bang and evolution. The heavens and the earth are so awesome that i cant imagine that it is an accident. We may have been created in God&#8217;s image but we have no idea what that image is. I dont think it was an ashton kutcher lookalike.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Krauss in a 2009 <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124597314928257169.html">Wall Street Journal</a> editorial outlines why science must be separate from religion. He says, &#8220;God is, of necessity, irrelevant in science.&#8221;</p>
<p>He refers to evolutionary biologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._B._S._Haldane">J.B. Haldane&#8217;s</a> idea that science is an atheistic discipline. This kind of talk angers many religious people but let&#8217;s look at what that really means. </p>
<p>In 1934 Haldane said, &#8220;When I set up an experiment I assume that no god, angel or devil is going to interfere with its course.&#8221; And science would lack consistency, reproducibility and integrity if supernatural interventions explained how the natural world works.</p>
<p>While Haldane was an true non-believing atheist, Krauss balks at the title, accepting the less extreme moniker of rational atheist (as opposed to an absolutist). He says, &#8220;Faced with the remarkable success of science to explain the workings of the physical world, many, indeed probably most, scientists understandably react as Haldane did.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MileyCyrus5.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/MileyCyrus5.jpg" alt="Miley Cyrus Fan Tweets" title="MileyCyrus5" width="520" height="246" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6462" /></a></p>
<p>And that ability to reason has allowed society to advance over the last 400 years. Krauss says that God has no place in science he also argues that the true believers in each of the leading world religions are themselves atheists regarding the specific sacred tenets of all other faiths. </p>
<p>Krauss says, &#8220;So while scientific rationality does not require atheism, it is by no means irrational to use it as the basis for arguing against the existence of God, and thus to conclude that claimed miracles like the virgin birth are incompatible with our scientific understanding of nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>When it comes to the hot topic of science and religion, those thought-provoking statements are far more incendiary than Miley Cyrus tweeting a picture of a theoretical physicist and saying his quote is beautiful. But that&#8217;s not what grabs headlines.</p>
<blockquote><p>Robot<br />
By: Miley Cyrus</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been like this from the start<br />
One piece after another to make my heart<br />
You mistake the game for being smart<br />
Stand here, sell this, and hit your mark</p>
<p>But the sound of the steel<br />
And the crush, and the grind<br />
It all screams who am I, to decide my life<br />
But in time it all dies,<br />
There&#8217;s nothing left inside<br />
Just rusted metal that was never even mine</p>
<p>I would scream<br />
But I&#8217;m just this hollow shell<br />
Waiting here, begging please<br />
Set me free so I can feel</p>
<p>HEY</p>
<p>Stop trying to live my life for me<br />
I need to breathe, I&#8217;m not your robot<br />
Stop telling me I&#8217;m a part of the big machine<br />
I&#8217;m breaking free,<br />
can&#8217;t you see<br />
I can love, I can speak<br />
Without somebody else operating me<br />
You gave me eyes and now I see<br />
I&#8217;m not your robot I&#8217;m just me</p>
<p>All this time, I&#8217;ve been mislead<br />
There was nothing but crossed wires in my head<br />
I&#8217;ve been taught to think that what I feel<br />
doesn&#8217;t matter at all<br />
till they say its real</p>
<p>I would scream<br />
But I&#8217;m just this hollow shell<br />
waiting here, begging please<br />
Set me free so I can feel</p>
<p>HEY</p>
<p>Stop trying to live my life for me<br />
I need to breathe, I&#8217;m not your robot<br />
Stop telling me I&#8217;m a part of the big machine<br />
I&#8217;m breaking free,<br />
can&#8217;t you see<br />
I can love, I can speak<br />
Without somebody else operating me<br />
You gave me eyes and now I see<br />
I&#8217;m not your robot, I&#8217;m just me</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not your robot, I&#8217;m just me<br />
I&#8217;m not your robot</p>
<p>I would scream,<br />
but I&#8217;m just this hollow shell<br />
Waiting here<br />
Breaking free<br />
Set me free so I can feel</p>
<p>HEY</p>
<p>Stop trying to live my life for me<br />
I need to breathe, I&#8217;m not your robot<br />
Stop telling me I&#8217;m a part of the big machine<br />

I can love, I can speak<br />

You gave me eyes and now I see<br />
I&#8217;m not your robot, I&#8217;m just me</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not your robot, I&#8217;m just me<br />
I&#8217;m not your robot</p>

<p>Last year 1,668 tornadoes raked the U.S. causing billions of dollars in damage and claiming many lives. Winter tornadoes tend to be infrequent and weak because they rely on warm water in the Gulf of Mexico which is cooler at that time of year. But not this year. Temperatures in the Gulf are running 2-4 degrees above normal because it&#8217;s been a very mild winter.</p>
<p>With that fuel ready to power severe storms all that is needed is a little push of cold unstable air coming across the Rocky Mountains and the recipe for severe tornado outbreaks is complete.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6434" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/TornadoMarch2012Henryville.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/TornadoMarch2012Henryville-e1331242449819.jpg" alt="Snow covers a storm-damaged home in Henryville, Indiana, March 5, 2012. REUTERS/John Sommers II" title="Snow covers a storm-damaged home in Henryville" width="325" height="212" class="size-full wp-image-6434" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Snow covers a storm-damaged home in Henryville, Indiana, March 5, 2012. Courtesy of Reuters/John Sommers II</p></div>March roared in like a lion this year with 139 tornadoes as of March 5, bringing the yearly total to 239. Some of those have yet to be confirmed. Last year at this time there were only 154 winter tornadoes reported but that was before several tornado outbreaks in April that devastated much of the Midwest and the South. </p>
<p>Because of the mild winter, the tornadoes are stronger than usual. Television meterologist Zack Shields says there are more F3 and F4 twisters being reported. Tornadoes rank from weakest to strongest on the <a href="http://www.tornadoproject.com/fscale/fscale.htm">Fujita Scale</a> from F0 to F5.</p>
<p>And some scientists only think the seasons will start earlier as the world warms. Climate scientist <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cas/trenbert.html">Kevin Trenberth</a> says, &#8220;As spring moves up a week or two, tornado season will start in February instead of waiting for April.&#8221; The National Center for Atmospheric Research scientist believes that climate change will likely change the severity and frequency of tornadoes.<div id="attachment_6436" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AnatomyofaTornado.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AnatomyofaTornado-e1331242685503.jpg" alt="Inside a Tornado, Courtesy of NOAA" title="AnatomyofaTornado" width="325" height="225" class="size-full wp-image-6436" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Inside a Tornado, Courtesy of NOAA</p></div></p>
<p>Researchers say that the two conditions necessary to spawn tornadoes will be affected in opposite ways. While the intensity of twisters will probably increase as the world warms a reduction in high altitude winds known as wind shear will follow, reducing the frequency of such events.</p>
<p>NASA atmospheric physicist <a href="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/adelgenio.html">Anthony Del Genio</a> says thunderstorms in the future will pack a more powerful punch but strike less frequently than in the past.</p>
<p>Despite wind shear making tornadoes less frequent, Trenberth sees last year&#8217;s record-breaking tornado season as a bad omen. In April 2011 multiple tornado outbreaks spun out 753 twisters that month, almost reaching the annual average of 800. In the past scientists have noticed a connection between the La Nina weather phenomenon and active tornado seasons. While a powerful La Nina last year likely made the tornado season so violent, a repeat La Nina this year is weakening and shouldn&#8217;t be much of a factor this season. </p>
<p>March generally marks the beginning of tornado season across the Midwest and deep South, with April and May as the peak months for severe thunderstorms that create ideal tornado conditions. Last year the tornado activity began on New Year&#8217;s and ramped up to big outbreaks in April and May.</p>

Funnel clouds raise and lower, making it hard to predict their path and even harder to warn people of impending danger. Currently the National Weather Service can issue a widespread Tornado Watch for a big geographic area then then a more precise Tornado Warning when a twister is imminent. But for the most part, people get about a 20-minute notice before the storm bears down on them.</p>
<p>In the recent spate of late February and early March storms, some people report only getting a three or four-minute head start before tornadoes pummeled entire towns.</p>
<p>New research is looking at ways to increase the warning lead time but weather prediction of this sort still baffles most meteorologists. Scientists will meet this summer to determine how they can do longer range tornado prediction. The National Weather Service is also in the process of installing upgraded radar for live forecasting, tracking and distinguishing of tornadoes, which according to NWS meteorologist <a href="http://www.stormcenter.com/wxcs2012/biography.html">Paul Schlatter</a> will help forecasters make more certain warnings and potentially save lives.</p>
<p>But those advances are about 8-10 years down the road. And in the meantime tornadoes are already bearing down on snow-covered towns.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="http://eplayer.clipsyndicate.com/embed/iframe?pf_id=1&#038;va_id=3327695&#038;windows=1&#038;show_title=0" width="425" height="330"></iframe></p>
<p>It may seem far away but astronomers have confirmed that a new planet orbiting a star 42 light years away is mostly made of water. This super Earth is much larger than our own planet and is one of several orbiting the star JG 1214, located in the constellation Ophiuchus (the serpent bearer).</p>
<p>The planet was actually spotted in 2009 by a first year graduate student working on the <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~zberta/mearth/Welcome.html">MEarth Project</a>, an array of ground-based robotic telescopes in Arizona. That student is credited with the discovery of the second &#8220;Super Earth&#8221; exoplanet.</p>
<p>Three years later that student is Harvard-Smithsonian astrophysicist <a href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~zberta/">Zachory Berta</a>. He says, &#8220;GJ 1214b is like no planet we know of.&#8221; And of the over 700 exoplanets that have been detected by ground-based and space telescopes over the past 15 years this one is unique for its high water content.</p>
<p>Brown University physics professor <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Physics/people/facultypage.php?id=1106969931">Ian Dell&#8217;Antonio</a> teaches a class about exoplanets. He tells the <a href="http://www.wpri.com/dpp/news/local_news/providence/exoplanet-discovery-explained">Providence Journal</a> that the discovery of this watery world is very important. He says, &#8220;[It has] interesting and perhaps intriguing properties in terms of the possibilities of the search for life.&#8221; </p>
<p><div id="attachment_6427" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ExoplanetGJ1214b.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/ExoplanetGJ1214b-e1331165983745.jpg" alt="Artist Rendering of Exoplanet GJ 1214b with Star GJ in the Background" title="ExoplanetGJ1214b" width="325" height="178" class="size-full wp-image-6427" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Artist Rendering of Exoplanet GJ 1214b with Star GJ in the Background</p></div>The new planet is 2.7 times Earth&#8217;s diameter and weighs nearly seven times as much as our home planet. Knowing its mass and size, scientists can then determine its density, which Berta and his team found to be 2 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc). For comparison, water&#8217;s density is just 1 g/cc and Earth is 5.5 g/cc.</p>
<p>For that reason, astronomers believe the planet is a water world, containing much more water than Earth and far less rock. </p>
<p>Even though it was a lot of water, it probably isn&#8217;t conducive to life as we know it. The average temperature is a steamy 446 degrees F. </p>
<p>Berta&#8217;s team studied the planet&#8217;s sunsets using the <a href="http://hubblesite.org/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> after initial analysis suggested that its atmosphere was made mostly of water. Astronomers studied how the planet&#8217;s atmosphere filtered starlight to determine its composition. Now in light of the high surface temperature the atmosphere is likely made of steam.</p>
<p>Berta says, &#8220;The high temperatures and high pressures would form exotic materials like &#8216;hot ice&#8217; or &#8216;superfluid water,&#8217; substances that are completely alien to our everyday experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>So this is an alien planet among alien planets. There are <a href="http://www.nasawatch.com/archives/2012/02/kepler-has-iden.html">over 2,300 candidate planets</a> that astronomers have identified using the <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">Kepler Space Telescope</a>, which has only been watching for exoplanets for 16 months. The candidate planets have yet to confirm many but with each new discovery science is adding a lot of diversity to our cosmic landscape.</p>
<p>Astronomers have found one planet that is as light and airy as Styrofoam and another that is as dense as iron. They have also found several alien worlds that orbit two suns or are locked in orbit around a single star.</p>
<p>Because GJ 1214b is so close to Earth, it is considered a prime candidate for future study by specialized instruments, including those that will be loaded on NASA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, which is slated to launch in 2018.</p>

<p>Ocean acidity is one of the most worrisome problems facing marine biologists. There is a lot that we don&#8217;t understand about the <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2007/06/21/carbon-cycle/">carbon cycle</a>, including exactly how much of the carbon dioxide human activity belches into the atmosphere ultimately ends up in the ocean. Scientists think it&#8217;s about 30 percent, give or take.</p>
<p>They know that the oceans act as a carbon sink, meaning excess atmospheric CO2 makes its way to the ocean where it gets absorbed. When carbon dioxide mixes with saltwater it turns to carbonic acid. The more carbon in the ocean the higher the acidity and the lower the ocean&#8217;s pH balance.</p>
<div id="attachment_6413" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 476px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/OceanAcidGraph.gif"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/OceanAcidGraph.gif" alt="As Carbon Dioxide Gas Dissolves in Seawater, Carbonic Acid Forms. In the Weak Acid Carbonate Ions neutralize Free Hydrogen Ions, Causing Carbonate Levels to Drop." title="OceanAcidGraph" width="466" height="320" class="size-full wp-image-6413" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">As Carbon Dioxide Gas Dissolves in Seawater, Carbonic Acid Forms. In the Weak Acid Carbonate Ions neutralize Free Hydrogen Ions, Causing Carbonate Levels to Drop.</p></div>
<p>Scientists studying the carbon cycle believe over 30 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions go straight into the oceans, which makes them progressively more acidic. <a href="http://www.realscience.us/2008/05/28/corrosive-ocean/">Acidification </a>harms many marine life forms and interferes with the development of shell-building creatures, especially those with calcium-carbonate skeletons, like corals and molluscs. It also can affect phytoplankton species, which are at the bottom of the ocean food chain but are an essential part of the marine network that feeds fish, crustaceans and other species. </p>
<p>New research from an international collaboration of scientists finds the ocean&#8217;s pH levels have dropped 0.1 unit during the 20th Century. Since the make up of the ocean has remained very stable for millions of years, this seemingly rapid change represents the largest shift in ocean chemistry in 300 million years.</p>
<p>For millions years the oceans have become hospitable to many forms of life because the chemistry has been stable. But about 56 million years ago volcanic activity coupled with the destabilization of frozen methane hydrates on the ocean floor forced the release of massive amounts of carbon dioxide. Ocean acidification then led to a mass extinction of marine animals.<div id="attachment_6410" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CretaceousNanoFossils.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CretaceousNanoFossils-e1331062839364.jpg" alt="Calcium Dependent Nano-Fossils under a Scanning Electron Microscope, L, before PETM, R, after PETM 56 Million Years Ago" title="CretaceousNanoFossils" width="325" height="179" class="size-full wp-image-6410" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Calcium Dependent Nano-Fossils under a Scanning Electron Microscope, (L) before PETM, (R) after PETM 56 Million Years Ago</p></div></p>
<p>But scientists warn that those rapid CO2 emissions were still at least ten times slower than those occurring now.  Dr. <a href="http://biogeochemistry.org/scientists/carles-pelejero">Carles Pelejero</a>, researcher at the CSIC Institute of Marine Sciences and <a href="http://icrea.cat/web/home.aspx">ICREA </a>in Spain says the fossil record &#8220;augurs more catastrophic consequences caused by current anthropogenic changes.&#8221; </p>
<p>The geological record shows how large disturbances on the planet can change the pH levels in the oceans. 65 million years ago when a giant meteor struck Earth killing the dinosaurs and marking the end of the Cretaceous Period oceans became more acidic. And 200 million years ago the Triassic Period may have ended with ocean acidification. The same can be said for the end of the Permian Period about 250 million years ago.</p>
<p>The one thing that all three of these major events have in common is warming temperatures, decreased oxygen and ocean acidification.<br />
<a href="http://www.falw.vu/~palmorph/frameset.html?http://www.falw.vu/~palmorph/staff/zivp.htm"><br />
Patrizia Ziveri</a>, a Spanish researcher at ICTA says, &#8220;Considering the effects we detect through fossil records, there is no doubt that we must tackle the problem at its roots as soon as possible, adopting measures to immediately reduce our CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.&#8221;</p>
<p>Columbia University paleoceanographer <a href="http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~hoenisch/Baerbels_webpage/home.html">Bärbel Hönisch</a> is the lead author on research that appears in the journal <em><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/335/6072/1058">Science</a></em>. She led the review of hundreds of paleoceanographic studies, and headed a team of researchers from five countries that found evidence for only one period in the last 300 million years when the oceans changed even remotely as fast as today &#8212; the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, or PETM, some 56 million years ago.</p>
<p>She says, &#8220;We know that life during past ocean acidification events was not wiped out — new species evolved to replace those that died off. But if industrial carbon emissions continue at the current pace, we may lose organisms we care about — coral reefs, oysters, salmon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The oceans act like a sponge to draw down excess carbon dioxide from the air. The greenhouse gas reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, which over time gets neutralized by fossil carbonate shells on the seafloor. But if CO2 goes into the oceans too quickly, it can deplete the carbonate ions that corals, mollusks and some plankton need for reef and shell-building. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_6411" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PteropodDissolvingShell.png"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/PteropodDissolvingShell-e1331064090183.png" alt="Pteropod Placed in Corrosive Water Simulating the Ocean in 2100.

The Shell Dissolves over 45-Day Period, courtesy of PMEL</p></div>And that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s happening now. From pterapods to coral reefs, shell-building creatures are struggling against increasingly acidic environments. Their shells are getting weaker and eventually if there aren&#8217;t enough carbonate ions available they won&#8217;t be able to build them at all. They will either adapt or become extinct.</p>
<p>In the early 1990s, scientists extracting sediments from the seafloor off Antarctica found a layer of 56-million-year-old mud from this period wedged between thick deposits of white plankton fossils. In a span of about 5,000 years, they estimated, a mysterious surge of carbon doubled atmospheric concentrations, pushed average global temperatures up by about 6 degrees C, and dramatically changed the ocean&#8217;s entire biotic landscape. </p>
<p>Hönisch says that in the last hundred years, atmospheric CO2 has risen about 30 percent, to 393 parts per million, and ocean pH has fallen by 0.1 unit, to 8.1&#8211;an acidification rate at least 10 times faster than that 56 million years ago.</p>
<p>And, the United Nations <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch10s10-4-2.html">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that pH may fall another 0.3 units</a> by the end of the century, to 7.8, raising the possibility that we may soon see ocean changes similar to those observed during the PETM.</p>
<p>NOAA oceanographer <a href="http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Richard++A.+Feely,+Ph.D.">Richard Feely</a> says studying the past may a good way to see the future. He wasn&#8217;t associated with the current study but says, &#8220;These studies give you a sense of the timing involved in past ocean acidification events — they did not happen quickly.&#8221; But current ocean acidification is happening at a very rapid pace. To that Dr. Feely says, &#8220;The decisions we make over the next few decades could have significant implications on a geologic timescale.&#8221; </p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Actor, science enthusiast and communicator Alan Alda has always been puzzled by science. As a kid asking basic questions he never walked away with the answers he sought. Perhaps that&#8217;s why he grew up to be an actor who played a doctor on TVs <em>M*A*S*H</em> and then went on to host PBS&#8217;s <em>Scientific American Frontiers</em>.</p>
<p>Throughout his career it is clear that one moment stuck out for him. When he was 11 years old he asked his teacher about the flame at the end of a candle. Her quick yet unsatisfying response only heightened the mystery. </p>
<p><div id="attachment_6392" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AlanAlda1.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/AlanAlda1-e1330976246525.jpg" alt="Actor, Science Communicator Alan Alda" title="AlanAlda1" width="325" height="244" class="size-full wp-image-6392" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Actor, Science Communicator Alan Alda</p></div>Last week, in a guest editorial in the journal <em><a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Flame-Challenge1019.full_.pdf">Science</a></em> (PDF), Alda placed The Flame Challenge. As a member of the faculty of Stony Brook University <a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/">Center for Communicating Science</a> he is calling upon scientists from around the country and around the world to submit their explanations of a flame. </p>
<p>The trick is that it can&#8217;t be couched in jargon. The explanation must be easily understood and appreciated by a panel of 11 year olds because that&#8217;s who will be judging the entries.</p>
<p>Obviously, Alda never got a satisfactory answer to his own question about the flame and that ignited a burning desire within him to communicate complex subject matter to a general audience.</p>
<p>Hey, that&#8217;s what REALscience does. How about that?</p>
<p>Alda says, &#8220;Scientists urgently need to be able to speak with clarity to funders, policy-makers, students, the general public, and even other scientists.&#8221; He even recounts the wish of some young researchers to be able to relay their work to their grandmothers.</p>
<p>He says he first became aware of the divide between scientists and the public when working on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/saf/">Scientific American Frontiers</a> where he abandoned the traditional interview format for a conversation because he had to ask so many questions to be able to understand what the researchers were saying.</p>
<p>During that process he humanized the science and let his audience see the people behind the lab coats. He says, &#8220;I began to think that clarity in communicating science is at the very heart of science itself.&#8221;<div id="attachment_6393" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 255px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CandleFlame.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/CandleFlame-e1330976334182.jpg" alt="What&#039;s Going on with A Candle Flame? Alan Alda Wants to Know" title="CandleFlame" width="245" height="319" class="size-full wp-image-6393" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">What&#039;s Going on with A Candle Flame? Alan Alda Wants to Know</p></div></p>
<p>Drawing from his personal disappointment over a concise and digestible explanation of a simple candle flame Alda is convinced that the failure to communicate science with clarity holds very serious consequences for society. He says, &#8220;We feel the disconnect all around us, from a common misimpression that evolution is the theory that we’re descended from monkeys, to the worry that physicists in Geneva might suck the universe into a teacup—or something uncomfortably smaller.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sixty-five years ago Alda&#8217;s teacher answered his inquiry about a candle flame with, &#8220;It&#8217;s oxidation.&#8221; Clearly that wasn&#8217;t a good enough explanation for the curious young Alda. Now he&#8217;s challenging the world&#8217;s chemists and physicists to come up with a better explanation and one a child can grasp.</p>
<p>For the next month <a href="http://www.flamechallenge.org/">The Flame Challenge</a> will light the way for scientists to intelligibly convey to a preteen panel what goes on at the end of a burning candle. Alda suggests the process could even be fun. The contest runs March 2 to April 2 and the results will be announced in June at the World Science Festival in New York.</p>
<blockquote><p>Rules:</p>
<p>1. Answer the question — “What is a flame?” — in a way an 11-year-old will find intelligible and maybe even fun.</p>
<p>2. Answers will be screened for accuracy by scientists, then judged by a panel of 11-year-olds.</p>
<p>3. Answers can be submitted through April 2, 2012. [<a href="http://www.centerforcommunicatingscience.org/?page_id=787">Click here for the entry form</a>.]</p>
<p>4. The winning entry will be unveiled at a special event at the World Science Festival in New York in June. The winner will get VIP tickets to the Festival, along with a Flame Challenge T-shirt, and the gratitude of a nation of 11-year-olds.</p>
<p>5. Finalist entries, as well as the winning entry, will be posted on the Flame Challenge website:<a href="http://www.flamechallenge.org/">www.flamechallenge.org</a></p>
<p>6. Entries can be written, spoken (on video), or told through graphics.</p>
<p>7. There is no limit on length, but remember – brevity is the soul of wit, particularly when the 11-year-old has a cell phone, an X-Box, a Facebook habit, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Jill Tarter has never been accused of being a small thinker. The astronomer and director of the <a href="http://www.seti.org/center-for-seti-research">Center for SETI Research</a>, one of three non-profit organizations that make up the SETI Institute. The purpose as the acronym implies is to search for extraterrestrial intelligence.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_6374" class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JillTarter.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/JillTarter-e1330629476286.jpg" alt="Astronomer Jill Tarter Makes Her TED Prize Wish, 2009." title="JillTarter" width="325" height="258" class="size-full wp-image-6374" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Astronomer Jill Tarter Makes Her TED Prize Wish, 2009.</p></div>In winning the <a href="http://www.tedprize.org/jill-tarter/">2009 TED Prize</a>, Dr. Tarter made her wish: &#8220;I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now three years later her wish is coming true in the form of <a href="http://www.setilive.org/">SETI Live</a>, a new public project that enlists citizen scientists to sift through radio telescope data, separating terrestrial noise from any extraterrestrial signal.</p>
<p>TED Prize Director Amy Novogratz says, &#8220;This landmark step empowers people around the globe to meaningfully contribute to this important scientific endeavor and work towards answering the ultimate question, &#8216;are we alone?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>SETI Live was created in collaboration with <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse </a>at Chicago’s Adler Planetarium where Dr. Chris Lintott is the principal investigator. He says, &#8220;Over the last few years, we have learned about the incredible desire of hundreds of thousands of people to take part in scientific research as they’ve used Zooniverse to classify galaxies, explore the Moon and even to discover planets.&#8221;<div id="attachment_6375" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 335px"><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/SETI.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/SETI-e1330629626940.jpg" alt="Allen Telescope Array, SETI" title="SETI" width="325" height="216" class="size-full wp-image-6375" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Allen Telescope Array, SETI</p></div></p>
<p>For the first time SETI supporters &#8212; many of whom donated excess computer processing time in the search for aliens in the SETI@home program &#8212; now can look through data streaming live from the <a href="http://kepler.nasa.gov/">Kepler Space Telescope</a> that is trained on a group of stars in the Kepler field where over 1,000 planets have been discovered.</p>
<p>But SETI Live almost didn&#8217;t go live. And the <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/science/ci_17926565">Allen Telescope Array (ATA) almost shut down</a> last year after deep budget cuts and the loss of a key funder. But the <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/12/06/seti_checks_out_kepler_habitable_exoplanets/">Air Force stepped up</a> and gave the search for extraterrestrials a new chance for success. They will fund a project that will keep the radio telescopes listening for signals from out of this world for the next five years. And a <a href="https://setistars.org/stars">crowdfunded project</a> helped raise $200,000 to dust off the telescopes and get them back online after they began the process of shutting down for good.</p>
<p>For the last 70 years we have been transmitting radio waves into space, beyond our ionosphere in hopes of reaching some other intelligent life in the universe. </p>
<p>The nearest star that astronomers know to have a planet is Epsilon Eridani, which is 10 light-years away. That means it would take ten years to travel there racing at the speed of light. And sound waves travel much slower. The distance that sound can travel in 70 years is our current radiosphere.</p>
<p>Our signals haven&#8217;t had time to reach planets outside our radiosphere, so there&#8217;s no chance they could detect them&#8230;yet. Another problem is that radio waves spread out over space, so the signal weakens as it travels, requiring an intelligent civilization to have powerful antennas to detect our signal. </p>
<p>The radiosphere works in reverse as well, but we don&#8217;t know of any extraterrestrial civilization so we can&#8217;t figure out the radiosphere if it started producing signals that could escape their ionosphere. But that is what SETI Live is all about. The project will scan the mountains of radio signal data, looking for signals that other-worldly civilizations are producing. </p>
<p>Until now, there were entire areas of the SETI project that were impossible to sort because of overlapping signals in crowded radio frequency bands. That&#8217;s where Tarter and her team decided it would be worthwhile getting human eyes on the data instead of relying on computer algorithms.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/SETILivelogo2.jpg"><img src="http://www.realscience.us/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/SETILivelogo2.jpg" alt="SETI Live" title="SETILivelogo2" width="192" height="237" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-6378" /></a>She says, &#8220;There are frequencies that our automated signal detection systems now ignore, because there are too many signals there.  Most are created by Earth’s communication and entertainment technologies, but buried within this noise, there may be a signal from a distant technology.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hopes that by recruiting a global army of volunteers the scientists can overcome the crowded frequency bands that confuse the computers. And, it&#8217;s all being done live. So if several volunteers mark the same data repeatedly the ATA can be stopped and go back for a second look.</p>
<p>Tarter says, &#8220;By doing this in real-time, we will have an opportunity to follow up immediately on what our volunteers discover.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lintott says, &#8220;This is what real alien hunting looks like. The pictures aren’t as pretty and it’s not as exciting as a flying saucer landing at your gate, but it is real science.&#8221;</p>
