<p>It&#8217;s been a long time!  Before my life was swallowed by the podcast of my novel <a href="http://antithesis.jdsawyer.net">Predestination and Other Games of Chance</a>, I recorded quite a bit for Reprobates Hour.  So now, to kick off part 2 of Season 3, <a href="http://richardcarrier.blogspot.com">Richard Carrier</a> returns to talk about science in the ancient world.  We discuss the works and missteps of <a href="http://www.rodneystark.com">Rodney Stark</a> and his theory of the scientific revolution, we talk about the amazing and usually forgotten scientific and technological discoveries and innovations in the ancient world, and have a lot of fun along the way.  In this first of three episodes, we talk about science in the Greek world.  Next week, we talk about the Roman world.  Hope you enjoy!</p>

<p>Meantime, check out the promo on the feed.  This one is important.  You see,  there’s only a few days left to pick up <a href="http://www.scottsigler.com/">Scott Sigler’s</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Infected-Novel-Scott-Sigler/dp/0307406105/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1207912482&amp;sr=8-1">Infected.</a></p>
<p>If you haven’t heard the podcast, you’ve been missing out. I’ll be posting a proper review in a couple days when I have time, but for now suffice it to say that even if you don’t like horror, you’re probably going to enjoy this book. Check out the Amazon reviews and get your copy - and try to get it before the 14th of April so that your purchase will count towards the New York Times Bestseller list. If Scott can make the list, it’s going to mean good things for ALL podcast authors - Sigler, Harwood, Lafferty, Hutchins, Wallace, myself, and all the others who are creating excellent free content for all of you guys out there in podcastland.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to go to Amazon, hit B&amp;N.com or go to a local brick-and-mortar store and look for the book with this disturbing cover:</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the premier episode that we made back in April of &#8216;06.  It has gobs of nudity and&#8230;oh, right, this is an audio file.   Well, it has a lot of entertaining banter.</p>
<p>In this episode we (in the first 20 minutes) introduce ourselves and talk about our personal journeys through the valley of faith to the mountains of reason (or, at least, our struggles to climb them).</p>
<p>From 20:12 to 22:57 , Heraflea (daughter of Heratick) gives us the Reprobates News.</p>
<p>From 21:00 to 29:00, we discuss the etymology of our name.  Gene Cook, the Infideguy, Rational Response Squad all get a mention as we talk about the mission of our show.</p>
<p>From 29:00 to 38:00, we talk about the pernicious effect of Walt Disney and the history of Romantic Love as a concept, and the incompleteness of skeptical apostasy from religion.</p>
<p>35:00 to 52:00, we talk about the process of apostasy and the fallout in the personal lives of apostates.</p>
<p>53:00 to 54:35, we talk about upcoming guests and plans for future shows.</p>
<p>54:36 to end, Juila Ecklar&#8217;s &#8220;Hands of God&#8221; from her CD &#8220;Divine Intervention&#8221;</p>
