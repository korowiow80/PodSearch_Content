The recipes are from his 4 star restaurant yet written for the home cook.

<itunes:summary>The Guys start off the show with a discussion of Food Industry&apos;s &quot;Health Choices&quot; program (hardly).  They then welcome Anne Mendelson, Author of The Surprising Story of Milk Through the Ages. Part cookbook-- with more than 120 enticing recipes-- part culinary history, part inquiry into the evolution of an industry, Milk is a one-of-a-kind book that will forever change the way we think about dairy products. Anne explores the ancient heritage of milk from lands that include Greece, Bosnia, Turkey, Israel, Persia, Afghanistan, and India, she mines a rich source of culinary traditions. Then takes the reader on a journey through the lands that traditionally only consumed milk fresh from the cow-- what she calls the Northwestern Cow Belt (northern Europe, Great Britain, North America). She shows us how milk reached such prominence in our diet in the nineteenth century that it led to the current practice of overbreeding cows and overprocessing dairy products. Her lucid explanation of the chemical intricacies of milk and the simple home experiments she encourages us to try are a revelation of how pure milk products should really taste. The delightfully wide-ranging recipes that follow are grouped according to the main dairy ingredient: fresh milk and cream, yogurt, cultured milk and cream, butter and true buttermilk, fresh cheeses. We learn how to make luscious Clotted Cream, magical Lemon Curd, that beautiful quasi-cheese Mascarpone, as well as homemade yogurt, sour cream, true buttermilk, and homemade butter. She gives us comfort foods such as Milk Toast and Cream of Tomato Soup alongside Panir and Chhenna from India. Here, too, are old favorites like Herring with Sour Cream Sauce, Beef Stroganoff, a New Englandish Clam Chowder, and the elegant Russian Easter dessert, Paskha. And there are drinks for every season, from Turkish Ayran and Indian Lassis to Batidos (Latin American milkshakes) and an authentic hot chocolate....</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Michael Ruhlman joins the guys to discuss his exciting new book Ratio. From Booklist: Ruhlman, who explained the basic ingredients, tools, and cookbooks essential to the home chef in The Elements of Cooking (2007), now offers an illuminating read on the magic numbers that lie at the heart of basic cookery. He divides the book into five parts (doughs, stocks, sausages, sauces, and custards). In each section he explains what essential properties make the ratios work and the subtle variations that differentiate, for instance, a bread dough (five parts flour, three parts water) from a biscuit dough (three parts flour, one part fat, two parts liquid). While making his case that &apos;possessing one small bit of crystalline information can open up a world of practical applications&apos; gets a little repetitive, it&apos;s certainly a lesson worth taking to heart. This revealing and remarkably accessible read offers indispensable information for those ready to cook by the seat of their pants; with a handy grasp of these ratios (and a dash of technique), willing chefs should have no excuse to remain tethered to recipe cards and cookbooks. --Ian Chipman...</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Bon Appetite Magazine recently named some of America&apos;s best ice cream shoppes. In New York - it&apos;s a fleet of ice cream trucks - Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream (the ice cream is also available in some stores such as Whole Foods).  A Washington D.C. native and a current Brooklynite, Benjamin Wallace is fast establishing himself as one of today&apos;s up-and-coming authors. Wallace&apos;s work has been published in GQ, Food &#38; Wine, Salon, The Washington Post, and Details, garnering national recognition for spotlighting conservative mouthpiece Glenn Beck in 2007. From 1996 to 2005, Wallace worked at Philadelphia Magazine where he not only served as Executive director, but also discovered the controversial historical tale that would later become the inspiration for his first book.   In the &quot;Billionaire&apos;s Vinegar: The Mystery of the World&apos;s Most Expensive Bottle of Wine&quot;, Wallace delves into the questionable authenticity of the story of a 1787 bottle of Chateau Lafite Bordeaux owned by Thomas Jefferson. Fetching $156,000 at auction, rumors concerning the bottle&apos;s legitimacy abounded, involving an intriguing web of eccentric, but overly wealthy characters who regularly indulged in wines worth thousands of dollars. Wallace investigated not just that one specific transaction, but the entire ostentatious world of wine collecting in the mid-eighties....</itunes:summary>

<itunes:summary>Food Network Magazine determined the best burger in every state of The Union.  The winner for NJ: Stage Left, of course.  So now The Food Network and NY Magazine have joined the chorus who recognize our burger as best in the land.   Nina Planck, food writer, entrepreneur, and mother, returns to the Restaurant Guys to discuss her latest book, &quot;Real Food for Mother and Baby&quot;. Drawing from her childhood growing up in rural Virginia, Nina remains a strong advocate for traditional foods and is undoubtedly a leading expert on farmers&apos; market and local food.  In fact, she created the first farmer&apos;s market in London and went on to direct New York City&apos;s Greenmarkets.  Nina first shook the culinary world with her groundbreaking book &quot;Real Food&quot;, in which she challenged the way we look at old-fashion, rich (and the often extremely fatty) foods like butter, whole milk, and lamb. Inspired by the birth of her son Julian, Nina extends her &quot;real food&quot; philosophy to motherhood and dispels many of the myths and misleading ideas about nutrition for mother and baby both.  Nina, a contributor to the New York Times and a reporter for TIME, currently resides in New York City with her husband Rob Kaufelt (owner of Murray&apos;s Cheese and Highland Park, NJ native) and their son Julian....</itunes:summary>
