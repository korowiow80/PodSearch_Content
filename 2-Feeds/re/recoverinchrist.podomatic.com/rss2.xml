    <description>We believe, according to John 14:6, that Jesus is the only way to heaven. That way is made, when the Holy Ghost pricks (John 6:44) our hearts, we confess (Romans 10:9) ourselves a sinner, and believe on Christ to be our savior. This is Christ&#8217; will (2 Peter 3:9) for us. When we, as a sinner, receive His gift for us, that is when our name is written in the Lambs book of life, Christ&#8217; shed blood is applied to our sinful lives, and He not only forgives our sins, but cleanses (1 John 1:9) us from all unrighteousness 

matt 28:9Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</description>

In these verses in Proverbs we find a comparison between a merry heart and a sorrowful heart. Verse 13 tells us that you can tell the condition of a man's heart by looking at his countenance (his facial appearance). When people are happy, you can tell by the sparkle in their eyes, their smile and their cheerful attitude. When they are older, they will even have what we call &quot;smile wrinkles&quot; instead of the wrinkles caused by frowning. Indeed, facial looks reveal a lot about a person. Even children speak up when they see someone who is unkind. Just by observing the countenance on someone, they might say, &quot;That is a mean man.&quot;

You can also read on a person's face when they have sorrow in their heart, especially when you know a person. We have all experienced someone saying to us, when we were troubled about something, &quot;What is wrong? Are you worried about something?&quot; We all have experiences in our lives that cause us to be broken-hearted about an incident. The scripture tells us that if we allow this sorrow of heart to continue, it can break our spirits.

How can we get over heart break over the loss of someone or something? We must give the person or situation to the Lord and ask Him to remove the sorrow and grief from our hearts. We can keep the good memories of a lost loved one, but we must not allow the enemy to torment us with the grief of our loss. God will replace the emptiness we feel from the loss of a mate, a child, a friend or a home, if we ask Him to do this. Jesus died on the cross, not only to give us eternal life, but He also died to take our grief and sorrows. Jesus Christ, on the cross bore all of our iniquities, pain, sickness and sorrow. Since He took them, we do not have to take these things, but rather receive our salvation, healing, deliverance and peace by faith.</description>

1Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;

   2It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

   3And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

   4And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

   5And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

   6And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

   7And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.

   8And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.

   9He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.

   10So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.

   11Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:

   12And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.

Thoughts for the Day

As we continue to look at the wisdom in the book of Proverbs we see that individual righteousness influences corporate righteousness, especially when a righteous person is in a position of leadership. Truly &quot;no man is an island&quot; unto himself. Each of our individual actions will have an effect on those around us. We can influence the world by our good deeds or our evil deeds. We each have a choice as to how we will live. Verse 10 tells us that when there are good reports in a city, the city rejoices. The city also has shouts of joy when criminals are arrested or evil is overthrown in a city. It is sad to say in our day, there seems to be more reports of evil than reports of good. When leadership is corrupt in high places, it filters down to all levels of our society and whole cities suffer.

In countries where there is democracy and the people are allowed to vote, the people have a responsibility to elect qualified moral leaders to their leadership posts. The devil uses lies to keep many people from voting. He wants to keep godly men and women away from the voting booth and get the candidates of his choice elected instead. If we do nothing, it makes it easy for the enemy to help those who could become the wrong leadership for our nations. Here are some of the lies the devil whispers to people to attempt to keep them from voting:

&quot;My one vote doesn't count anyway.&quot; &quot;I'm disillusioned by the whole political process.&quot; &quot;I'm already too busy to take the time to cast an informed vote, so I just don't vote at all.&quot; &quot;Politics are corrupt anyway and as a Christian I don't want to be involved.&quot;

These are just some of the excuses that people use to justify their failure to exercise their civil responsibility to vote. Only heaven will reveal the many opportunities that we had to change things for the better in our nations, yet we failed to do so because we did not use our right to vote. We do not realize the privilege we have to be able to have a voice in the choice of who shall be our leaders and what kind of laws should govern our land. If we were to go to a country that did not afford its people this right and live under the usual dictators that rule those countries, we might be more thankful for this advantage.

The heart of God is expressed in the Bible for His concern for government leaders by telling us that we should pray in this vein when we look at the admonition in the following verses:

1 Timothy 2:1-4: &quot;I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; 2 For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty. 3 For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour; 4 Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. &quot;

Should we not assume that if the Lord would have us pray for leaders, would He not also want us to use every opportunity to assist in electing the leaders that would be the best ones for promoting peace and righteousness? Yes, Jesus, himself said in Luke 20:25: &quot;And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's, and unto God the things which be God's.&quot;

If we have been given a civil responsibility by government (Caesar) to vote, we should take that opportunity. Caesar was the Roman emperor at that time, so Jesus was telling them they were to pay their taxes, as well as support the work of God. These scriptures tell us as Christians that we are to be good citizens as well and pay our taxes. As good citizens in our nations, we should not leave the operation of the government to ungodly men if we have opportunity to change things. How can we prevent that? One way is to use our one vote wisely. We will be accountable before God as to how we voted. Another issue is to spend time in study and prayer so that we can vote wisely for the proper candidates, as well as the right issues. Recently, in the presidential election of 2000 in the U.S.A. we have seen how one vote does make a difference. As Christians, our lives should make a difference in the circle of influence that we each have. Let us each live righteous lives wherever we are, so that our nations are changed.

Proverbs 14:34: &quot;Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.

i want to give a special thanks to Preacher mike for the great message of god, along with Brother Randy Jenkins for his praising the lord. Thanks guys for your obediance

 Thoughts for the Day

These verses in the book of Proverbs describe the ways of a prostitute, with a warning of the deadly fate that awaits those who embrace her. The description of the whore in verse 13 is one of a foolish woman who is noisy and open to all forms of evil.  She is willfully reckless and knows nothing of eternal values. Verses 14 and 15 describe her at the door of her house inviting the upright men to come in.  She even finds her way to the &quot;high places&quot; or places of influence in the city, tempting those men to join her in &quot;stolen waters&quot; and &quot;the eating of bread in secret.&quot;   This is simply a description of forbidden sexual pleasures that are done in secret. Those that lack understanding and are easily led astray by their lust, will turn into her house (verse 16). Men who go there, will join the past transgressors that embrace death, and the whore's ways. Ultimately they all will end up in hell unless they repent and turn to God (verse 18).

The deeds of wicked women are recorded in the Bible so that we might observe their lives and learn the consequences of sin. One of the most wicked women in the whole Bible was the woman known as Jezebel. Her complete story is told in chapters 16, 18, 19 &amp; 21 of 1 Kings and chapter 9 of 2 Kings. Jezebel was a strong woman in intellect and will. The scripture does not mention that she had any of the finer, nobler feminine qualities. She was savage and relentless. This proud and strong minded female carried out her foul schemes unmercifully. Her evil plans included murder of an innocent man, to seize his property because her husband, Ahab desired it for his own. She was a gifted woman, yet she prostituted all her gifts for the furtherance of evil and her misdirected talents became a curse. Persuasive, her influence was wrongly directed. Resolute above other women, she used her strength to destroy a king and her own offspring, as well as pollute the life of a nation. Jezebel was an ardent idolater, who also practiced witchcraft, as she sought to convert Israel to Baal worship. Her own life ended in a horrible tragic death as she reaped what she had sown.

Perhaps one of Jezebel's worst traits was that she was a dominating and controlling wife. Ahab was like a puppet in the hands of his overpowering wife. Spineless Ahab did not resist the evil scheming of his ruthless wife. In this marriage, Ahab was the weaker vessel, with a wife who mocked at what conscientious scruples he did possess. It could have been that Ahab was more luxury-loving and sensual than cruel, but under the complete domination of a ruthless woman, he was forced to act against his finer feelings. Today, many women are falling under this same &quot;Jezebel Spirit&quot; as they want to rule their households and husbands.  They are determined to have their own way and are not submitted to the Lord.  True submission involves both husband and wife submitting to the Lord; then, they are able to submit one to another in love. Men can act like &quot;Jezebels&quot; too if they have a domineering attitude over their wives. Women like Jezebel, who have led their husbands astray, are still doing it today. 

However, women who move in faith and obedience to God can be responsible for influencing their husbands in the things of God.  As this kind of woman prays and reaches out in love, the whole atmosphere of the home can change. It would be quite a revelation to take inventory of how many men came to know the Lord Jesus as a result of the faith of some woman. I have heard of thousands of testimonies of men who were saved as a direct result of a praying mother, wife or girlfriend. Jezebel may have led her man astray, but God has used many women to bring their men back to Him.   Allegiance and submission to the Lord bring miracles of deliverance to entire families.

 Thoughts for the Day

These verses in the book of Proverbs describe the ways of a prostitute, with a warning of the deadly fate that awaits those who embrace her. The description of the whore in verse 13 is one of a foolish woman who is noisy and open to all forms of evil.  She is willfully reckless and knows nothing of eternal values.

 Proverbs Day 49 (KJV):

Proverbs 8:15-17:(KJV): &quot;By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth. 17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.&quot;

Thoughts for the Day

Our study in the book of Proverbs continues with an emphasis on the value of having God's wisdom. These verses tell us that good rulers in the earth will rule justly, by using the sound wisdom that is recorded in the Bible. Any student of history knows that throughout the ages the most prosperous and blessed earthly kingdoms have been those that had a Christian influence coming from the leadership of those nations.

Historically, when true Christianity came to any region, those who were practicing Christ's commands would began to reach out to help the poor, the oppressed, the sick, and needy. Most of our present day hospitals, charity centers, orphanages and rescue missions were all founded by Christians in keeping with the Biblical commands of Christ to demonstrate His love to a needy world. God has always been interested in helping the weak, the feeble and afflicted.  Ungodly societies destroy their weak, helpless and burdensome members.

We are praying that the ungodly practice of abortion will cease in all nations that now legally allow and encourage it. This practice does not show the love of God toward babies or basic respect for human life. Rather, it is an unloving act that is adversely affecting all of society.  The more we harden our hearts to the idea of protecting the sanctity of human life, the more susceptible we all become to violent crimes against humanity.  Regardless of what those who believe in abortion rights claim, most abortions are not done to protect the mother's life or some other so-called valid reason,  but rather to allow the parents to escape their responsibility of caring for the little life they had a part in creating.  Most abortions are done out of pure selfishness. The mother and father simply did not want a child to interfere with their plans.   The Bible teaches we are to overcome selfishness, not encourage it. We need to reverse the law in our land that allows abortions so freely, as the soul of our nation has accepted a practice that we will all regret. The consequences of murder is &quot;a life for a life&quot; and this will mean the loss of much life in any nation that practices abortion unless the people repent.

Numbers 35:33:  &quot;So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.&quot;

In verse 17 of Proverbs 8, the Lord says, that He will love those that love Him.  How do we show love for God?   We show it by loving one another and keeping His commandments.  If we desire to have His favor and love, then we must seek Him &quot;early&quot; or to put it another way, we must seek Him early enough, before His patience and mercy runs out and we are faced with severe judgment on our nations. We must repent and turn back to God and obey His commandments.

Prayer for the Day

Dear Heavenly Father,  We do ask you to forgive the sin of murder, due to the abortions in our nation.  Lord, this sin of murder began with the sin of lust and selfishness. Deliver Your people from these sins.   Help me Lord, to overcome my own selfishness, and be willing to lay down my wants for the sake of the kingdom of God.  Help me to think of others and their needs, and not concentrate so much on my own needs.  Thank you, that You are taking care of my needs, so that I can help and bless others.  Lord, I pray for the leaders of our nation.  Give them wisdom, protect them from harm, give them strength and health.   Turn our nation back to the Christian principles that it was founded upon. Thank you, Lord for being merciful to all of us.  In Jesus' name I pray.  Amen.</description>

 Proverbs Day 48 (KJV):

Proverbs 8:14(KJV): &quot;Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.&quot;

Thoughts for the Day

Proverb's theme of God's wisdom runs throughout this book. These verses tell us that God's wisdom will give us sound   counsel.  Many people today are seeking their counsel in the wrong places and most of the time, the advice they are receiving is not based on God's Word, but rather, is usually telling people to be selfish and look after &quot;number one.&quot;  So many are going to fortune tellers, psychics, card readers, astrology books, etc. The Bible warns us that this type of counsel is not only wrong, but is opening one's spirit up to a form of witchcraft. When people are seeking advice from anyone who claims to have supernatural powers, (other than the true power of Christ and His prophets, and servants;) they are committing a sin, that the Lord calls an abomination.

Deuteronomy 18:9-15: &quot;When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.
10 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch,
11 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.
12 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.
13 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.
14 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.
15 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken.&quot;

These verses in Deuteronomy mention several very wicked things these nations were doing, because they did not know God.   They   were using divination, astrology (observering the times),  and getting their advice or counsel from enchanters or witches and wizards. They were seeking the dead (necromancy) and having seances (consulting with familiar spirits).  They were even offering their children to the god Molech to be burned (verse 10).  Our civilized world today thinks how ghastly that was for people to murder their own children. However, our modern society does the same thing by committing abortion. Many nations of the world are killing their children before they are born. This is murder and is also an abomination in the sight of God.

God does not want us to seek counsel in the wrong places.  He wants to direct us and give us His understanding. He declares that He is wisdom, understanding and strength. Moses wrote the book of Deuteronomy and in Verse 15 he tells us that we are to seek the true Prophet, Jesus.  If God shows us something that we should do and we feel we could not possibly do it or face it, His promise to His children is to give them the strength to accomplish it.  One of the greatest scriptures we can quote for strength is found in the New Testament:

Philippians 4:13 &quot;I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.&quot;

We are also told that the way to overcome is not to rely on our own strength and wisdom, but to look to God for for His counsel and His advice and His strength to obey Him. He promises to give us the strength to resist and overcome the temptations that we face. We are told in Ephesians 6:10: &quot;Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.&quot;  He did not tell me I had to be strong in my own strength, but rather, to &quot;be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.&quot; I can rely on Him for all I need, He will give me His might.  I can trust the Words of the Bible to be the right advice.  I can trust that the Lord will enable me to keep it. In so doing I will walk in strength and victory!</description>

 Proverbs Day 42 (KJV):

Proverbs 6:30-35(KJV):  &quot;Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.&quot;

Thoughts for the Day

These verses in Proverbs contrast how men in general react to a thief and an adulterer when they are caught. Verse 30 begins by explaining when a thief steals because he is hungry, people tend not to judge them as harshly, as when they steal for other reasons. The thief will be judged, however, as no one likes his goods stolen. Verse 31 describes what the punishment for thievery should be. The thief should restore sevenfold what he stole, even if it means selling his own household goods or house to make it right. Restoration is God's plan for making up for the loss of what the thief took.

Verse 32 goes on to say although thievery is bad in the eyes of men, adultery is worse because it will destroy his own soul.  Verse 33 says that when the adulterer is caught, he will not only be wounded in the process, but he will also be dishonored in the public eye.   With this dishonor, comes reproach that will not be wiped out. This simply means people will never forget about the act of adultery and it will always be a part of a man's record in this life. We have witnessed this in our nation not only in the public arena with a president and other congressional leaders guilty of adultery, but many of our religious leaders have been caught in this act of unfaithfulness too.  Their reproach has not been wiped away and is still with them today and it will be written down in the history books. If they repent, the Lord will forgive them, but the public in general is not that forgiving. Many people will never forget.

Some men, when they find out that some other man has had an affair with their wife, allow their rage and jealousy to make even  worse attacks against the adulterer. Verses 34 and 35 say, that even when they are offered gifts or a settlement, it will not compensate for the damage that is done.   Some angry husbands will not rest, nor be content with an apology, but are bent on destroying the guilty one. Many cases of murder have happened because of the sin of adultery.  The Bible is very clear that if a young man wants an honorable life, he must resist this deadly sin of pursuing an affair with a married woman.

 Proverbs Day 42 (KJV):

Proverbs 6:30-35(KJV):  &quot;Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.&quot;

Thoughts for the Day

These verses in Proverbs contrast how men in general react to a thief and an adulterer when they are caught. Verse 30 begins by explaining when a thief steals because he is hungry, people tend not to judge them as harshly, as when they steal for other reasons. The thief will be judged, however, as no one likes his goods stolen. Verse 31 describes what the punishment for thievery should be. The thief should restore sevenfold what he stole, even if it means selling his own household goods or house to make it right. Restoration is God's plan for making up for the loss of what the thief took.

Verse 32 goes on to say although thievery is bad in the eyes of men, adultery is worse because it will destroy his own soul.  Verse 33 says that when the adulterer is caught, he will not only be wounded in the process, but he will also be dishonored in the public eye.   With this dishonor, comes reproach that will not be wiped out. This simply means people will never forget about the act of adultery and it will always be a part of a man's record in this life. We have witnessed this in our nation not only in the public arena with a president and other congressional leaders guilty of adultery, but many of our religious leaders have been caught in this act of unfaithfulness too.  Their reproach has not been wiped away and is still with them today and it will be written down in the history books. If they repent, the Lord will forgive them, but the public in general is not that forgiving. Many people will never forget.

Some men, when they find out that some other man has had an affair with their wife, allow their rage and jealousy to make even  worse attacks against the adulterer. Verses 34 and 35 say, that even when they are offered gifts or a settlement, it will not compensate for the damage that is done.   Some angry husbands will not rest, nor be content with an apology, but are bent on destroying the guilty one. Many cases of murder have happened because of the sin of adultery.

And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.2And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.

3And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

4As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.

5Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

6And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

8And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

9And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

11And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

12And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.

15And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

16And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.

17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

18And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!

19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

21But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

22And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 



Advocate: My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: (1 John 2:1)
Almighty: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. (Revelation 1:8)
Alpha and Omega: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. (Revelation 1:8)
Amen: And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write; these things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God; (Revelation 3:14)
Angel: The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth. (Genesis 48:16)   Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared. Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for My name is in him.(Exodus 23:20-21)
Angel of His presence: In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old. (Isaiah 63:9)
Anointed: The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the Lord, and against his anointed, saying, (Psalms 2:2)
Apostle: Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus; (Hebrews 3:1)
Arm of the Lord: Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon? Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? (Isaiah 51:9-10)
Author and Finisher of our faith: Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God. (Hebrews 12:2)

1Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;

   2It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.

   3And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.

   4And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.

   5And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?

   6And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.

The purpose of Saddleback Church's Celebrate Recovery ministry is to fellowship and celebrate God's healing power in our lives through the &quot;8 Recovery Principles.&quot; This experience allows us to &quot;be changed.&quot; By working and applying these Biblical principles, we begin to grow spiritually. We become free from our addictive, compulsive and dysfunctional behaviors. This freedom creates peace, serenity, joy and most importantly, a stronger personal relationship with God and others. As we progress through the program we discover our personal, loving and forgiving Higher Power - Jesus Christ, the one and only true Higher Power.




    1. Realize I&#8217;m not God; I admit that I am powerless to control my tendency to do the wrong thing and my life is unmanageable.
    &#8221;Happy are those who know they are spiritually poor.&#8221; Matthew 5:3

    2. Earnestly believe that God exists, that I matter to Him, and that He has the power to help me recover.
    &#8221;Happy are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.&#8221; Matthew 5:4

    3. Consciously choose to commit all my life and will to Christ&#8217;s care and control.
    &#8221;Happy are the meek.&#8220; Matthew 5:5

    4. Openly examine and confess my faults to God, to myself and to another person whom I trust.
    &quot;Happy are the pure in heart.&quot; Matthew 5:8

    5. Voluntarily submit to any and all changes God wants to make in my life.
    &quot;Happy are those whose greatest desire is to do what God requires.&quot; Matthew 5:6

    6. Evaluate all my relationships, offer forgiveness to those who have hurt me and make amends for harm I&#8217;ve done to others when possible, except when doing so would harm them or others.
    &quot;Happy are the merciful&quot; Matthew 5:7 &quot;Happy are the peacemakers&quot; Matthew 5:9

    7. Reserve a daily time with God for self-examination, Bible reading, and prayer in order to know God and His work for my life and gain the power to follow His will.

    8. Yield myself to be used by God to bring this good news to others, both by my example and by my words.
    &#8220;Happy are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires.&#8221;
    Matthew 5:10

The purpose of Saddleback Church's Celebrate Recovery ministry is to fellowship and celebrate God's healing power in our lives through the &quot;8 Recovery Principles.&quot; This experience allows us to &quot;be changed.&quot; By working and applying these Biblical principles, we begin to grow spiritually. We become free from our addictive, compulsive and dysfunctional behaviors. This freedom creates peace, serenity, joy and most importantly, a stronger personal relationship with God and others. As we progress through the program we discover our personal, loving and forgiving Higher Power - Jesus Christ, the one and only true Higher Power.




    1. Realize I&#8217;m not God; I admit that I am powerless to control my tendency to do the wrong thing and my life is unmanageable.
    &#8221;Happy are those who know they are spiritually poor.&#8221; Matthew 5:3

    2. Earnestly believe that God exists, that I matter to Him, and that He has the power to help me recover.
    &#8221;Happy are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.&#8221; Matthew 5:4

    3. Consciously choose to commit all my life and will to Christ&#8217;s care and control.
    &#8221;Happy are the meek.&#8220; Matthew 5:5

    4. Openly examine and confess my faults to God, to myself and to another person whom I trust.
    &quot;Happy are the pure in heart.&quot; Matthew 5:8

    5. Voluntarily submit to any and all changes God wants to make in my life.
    &quot;Happy are those whose greatest desire is to do what God requires.&quot; Matthew 5:6

    6. Evaluate all my relationships, offer forgiveness to those who have hurt me and make amends for harm I&#8217;ve done to others when possible, except when doing so would harm them or others.
    &quot;Happy are the merciful&quot; Matthew 5:7 &quot;Happy are the peacemakers&quot; Matthew 5:9

    7. Reserve a daily time with God for self-examination, Bible reading, and prayer in order to know God and His work for my life and gain the power to follow His will.

    8. Yield myself to be used by God to bring this good news to others, both by my example and by my words.
    &#8220;Happy are those who are persecuted because they do what God requires.&#8221;
    Matthew 5:10

Job 14

   1Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.

   2He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.

   3And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?

   4Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

   5Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

   6Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.

   7For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.

   8Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;

   9Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.

   10But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?

   11As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:

   12So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

   13O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!

   14If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

   15Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.

   16For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?

   17My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity. </description>

2 Corinthians 1

   1Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:

   2Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.

   3Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;

   4Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.

   5For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.

   6And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.

   7And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.

   8For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:

   9But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:

   10Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;

   11Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.

   12For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.

   13For we write none other things unto you, that what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;

   14As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.

   15And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;

   16And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.

   17When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?

   18But as God is true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.

   19For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.

   20For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.

   21Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;

   22Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.

   23Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.

   24Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</description>

Matthew 1

   1The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.

   2Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;

   3And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

   4And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;

   5And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;

   6And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

   7And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;

   8And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;

   9And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;

   10And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;

   11And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:

   12And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

   13And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;

   14And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;

   15And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;

   16And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.

   17So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

   18Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

   19Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.

   20But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

   21And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

   22Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

   23Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.

   24Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

   25And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.

Matthew 2

   1Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,

   2Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

   3When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

   4And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.

   5And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,

   6And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

   7Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.

   8And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

   9When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over where the young child was.

   10When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.

   11And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

   12And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

   13And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.

   14When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night, and departed into Egypt:

   15And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.

   16Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had diligently inquired of the wise men. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,

   18In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be comforted, because they are not.

   19But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

   20Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.

   21And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel.

   22But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:

   23And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.

 A morning and evening daily devotional based on the King James Version Bible.

October 08, Morning

Daily Light

I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell: yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven. None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy. I will speak of thy testimonies ... before kings, and will not be ashamed.

Heb. 13:6. Rom. 8:35,37. Luke 12:4,5. Matt. 5:10-12. Acts 20:24. Ps. 119:46.

Daily Light

He set my feet upon a rock.

That Rock was Christ. Simon Peter ... said, Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God. Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
Full assurance of faith. Faith without wavering. Faith, nothing wavering ... He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Ps. 40:2. 1 Cor. 10:4. Matt. 16:16,18. Acts 4:12. Heb. 10:22,23. James 1:6. Rom. 8:35,37,39.

   1And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.

   2And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore famine in Samaria.

   3And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:

   4For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.)

   5And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.

   6So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

   7And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord Elijah?

   8And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.

   9And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?

   10As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.

   11And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.

   12And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.

   13Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophets by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?

   14And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shall slay me.

   15And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.

   16So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to meet Elijah.

   17And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?

   18And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.

   19Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.

   20So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the prophets together unto mount Carmel.

   21And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.

   22Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.

   23Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under:

   24And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.

   25And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on the name of your gods, but put no fire under.

   26And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.

   27And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said, Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.

   28And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.

   29And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.

   30And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD that was broken down.

   31And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came, saying, Israel shall be thy name:

   32And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.

   33And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.

This verse from Proverbs tells us that a person who has an abundance of food will not care for an honeycomb; while a person who is hungry, even food that is bitter is sweet to them. Many people who are rich are also wasteful. They never think about the crumbs from their table that could feed others. They simply throw away things that they do not want even things that are still good and would be a help to someone who had nothing. Western societies like ours, who have so much abundance compared to the rest of the world, can be insensitive to the needs of those who are suffering in other parts of the world. I believe we commit a great sin when we keep indulging our own desires, while turning away from the cries of the poor and hungry of the world. If every Christian gave to the poor and the needy, we could reduce hunger in the world substantially. Jesus went about doing good and ministering to the poor and we, as His followers, should do likewise. Jesus demonstrated His compassion for the poor, and also His frugality, in the story of His feeding of the five thousand.

Matthew 14:14-21:
14 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.
16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two fishes.
18 He said, Bring them hither to me.
19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.</description>

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thegiftband.net/default.htm&quot;&gt;The Gift&lt;/a&gt;


In 2003 Chad had a vision. A vision of a band that has a purpose. The mission
of the band will be to serve God, talk about Jesus and create an atmosphere to
examine truthfully your relationship with our Saviour. The Gift was born.

The band has diverse influences, Trace Adkins to Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix
to Hank Williams Sr., P.O.D. to Evanessence, Robert Johnson to Grand Funk
Railroad, Tim McGraw to Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Chad started the band with family members, wife, sister and brother-in-law.
The Gift through personnel changes, has changed from a family band to a
band that is truly family. The band has been successful at accomplishing it&#8217;s
mission before it ever played a show and the future holds more victories in the
name of Jesus. God is ever faithful.

The Gift has diversity. The members have a range of musical experience with
various other bands and genres. Also, the members attend various churches.
The music reflects this diversity as the writing is done collectively. The lyrics
are straight to the point and are doctrinally correct .The Gift&#8217;s music is hard to
put into a nice neat box. Our diversity and reliance on God&#8217;s providence is our
appeal and strength.

The band has played prisons, youth groups and various church functions.
But, any event is possible as long as it falls into our criteria. The only criteria
for where we will play is we have to lift up the name of Jesus and the gospel.

The Gift


In 2003 Chad had a vision. A vision of a band that has a purpose. The mission
of the band will be to serve God, talk about Jesus and create an atmosphere to
examine truthfully your relationship with our Saviour. The Gift was born.

The band has diverse influences, Trace Adkins to Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix
to Hank Williams Sr., P.O.D. to Evanessence, Robert Johnson to Grand Funk
Railroad, Tim McGraw to Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Chad started the band with family members, wife, sister and brother-in-law.
The Gift through personnel changes, has changed from a family band to a
band that is truly family. The band has been successful at accomplishing it&#8217;s
mission before it ever played a show and the future holds more victories in the
name of Jesus. God is ever faithful.

The Gift has diversity. The members have a range of musical experience with
various other bands and genres. Also, the members attend various churches.
The music reflects this diversity as the writing is done collectively. The lyrics
are straight to the point and are doctrinally correct .The Gift&#8217;s music is hard to
put into a nice neat box. Our diversity and reliance on God&#8217;s providence is our
appeal and strength.

The band has played prisons, youth groups and various church functions.
But, any event is possible as long as it falls into our criteria. The only criteria
for where we will play is we have to lift up the name of Jesus and the gospel.

      <title>Genesis 17</title>
      <description>Proverbs 16:18: Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.

1 John 2:16-17:
16 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
17 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

Men are mortal and prone to weakness and error. If we rely on self, without the underlying foundation of faith in God, we will at some point in our life face a situation where self reliance fails us. We must all realize if we have any abilities, and are able to accomplish anything in this world, it is because God has gifted us with those abilities and gave us the health, strength and desire to be able to achieve those things. Many self-made men and women will testify to the fact that they reached a point in their lives where they were no longer able to keep on going. They faced problems they were not able to solve on their own. They were forced by their halting circumstances to call on God. Confidence in our own abilities, without God, is a false foundation and will crumble under the attack of the devil and his evil powers. Only God's power can defeat the evil attacks of Satan.

Verse 28 tells us that a person who cannot rule over his own spirit is as vulnerable to attacks as a city that is broken down and has no wall around it for defense. In Bible days, most cities had high walls around them for protection against enemies. They had gates that were open during the day for the commerce trade to come and go, but they would shut them at night so that no intruders would gain an advantage of them.

As individuals we become vulnerable to the devil's attacks if we do not have a wall around our own spirits. Our &quot;wall&quot; and &quot;high tower&quot; that gives us protection is found in our faith in Jesus. He is the one who keeps our hearts and minds steady so that we are able to resist the attacks of the enemy. He is our solid rock and we can remain steady and solid because of Him. David speaks of this in the book of Samuel.

2 Samuel 22:1-4:
1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:
2 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;
3 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.
4 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.

If we do not rely on Jesus to keep us, the enemy of our souls, the devil, could come in and drive us crazy. However, all Christians have the promise of God to be able to keep our minds and souls against the onslaughts of the wicked one. We are required to reinforce our cities (lives) by keeping our walls built up. We do this spiritually by reading the Word of God, praying and fellowshipping with others of like faith.

Isaiah 26:1-4:
1 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
2 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
3 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.
4 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength.</description>

Daily Light

I will not fear what man shall do unto me.

Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell: yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven. None of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy. I will speak of thy testimonies ... before kings, and will not be ashamed.

Heb. 13:6. Rom. 8:35,37. Luke 12:4,5. Matt. 5:10-12. Acts 20:24. Ps. 119:46.

He set my feet upon a rock.

That Rock was Christ. Simon Peter ... said, Thou art the Christ the Son of the living God. Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.
Full assurance of faith. Faith without wavering. Faith, nothing wavering ... He that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Ps. 40:2. 1 Cor. 10:4. Matt. 16:16,18. Acts 4:12. Heb. 10:22,23. James 1:6. Rom. 8:35,37,39.

Genesis 11

   1And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.

   2And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.

   3And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.

   4And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.

   5And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.

   6And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.

   7Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.

   8So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.

   9Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

   10These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

   11And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

   12And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:

   13And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.

   14And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:

   15And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.

   16And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:

   17And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.

   18And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

   19And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.

   20And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

   21And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.

   22And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

   23And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

   24And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

   25And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.

   26And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

   27Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

   28And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

   29And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

   30But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

   31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

   32And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</description>

   18And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:

   19And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.

   20And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:

   21And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.

   22And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:

   23And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.

   24And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:

   25And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.

   26And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

   27Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.

   28And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.

   29And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.

   30But Sarai was barren; she had no child.

   31And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

   32And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</itunes:summary>

Genesis 9

   1And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.

   2And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand are they delivered.

   3Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as the green herb have I given you all things.

   4But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.

   5And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.

   6Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.

   7And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth, and multiply therein.

   8And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,

   9And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you;

   10And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl, of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.

   11And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.

   12And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:

   13I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth. .

 Proverbs Day 266 (KJV):

Proverbs 25:8-10 (KJV):
8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
9 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:
10 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.

Proverbs 25:8-10 (AMP):
8 Rush not forth soon to quarrel (before magistrates or elsewhere), lest you know not what to do in the end when your neighbor has put you to shame.
9 Argue your cause with your neighbor himself; discover not and disclose not another's secret,
10 Lest he who hears you revile you and bring shame upon you and your ill repute have no end.

Thoughts for the Day

These verses from Proverbs warn us not to get into a public quarrel, but rather, try to settle the problem with our neighbor first privately, as he could testify against us and take us to court and they could rule in his favor and we could end up in shame. The Bible counsels us to avoid strife and court, if at all possible, as the Lord wants us to walk in peace with all men. It is much better to take an humble position and try to work out our differences with a neighbor, than to get in strife and end up in court. We are not to go and gossip about the matter, telling secrets to others, as this will only rile the neighbor more and he could cause more trouble. We have no guarantee as to the judge ruling in our favor and we may even be in the wrong to some degree. If we are proven wrong, the Bible tells us to agree with our adversary quickly, as he can deliver us to the judge and the judge can rule that we are to be given over to the officer to lock us in prison and we will not be released until we have paid our penalty in full.

Genesis 17

   1And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.

   2And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly.

   3And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,

   4As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.

   5Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee.

   6And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.

   7And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.

   8And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.

   9And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.

   10This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised.

   11And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.

   12And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed.

   13He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.

   14And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken my covenant.

   15And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.

   16And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of people shall be of her.

   17Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?

   18And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!

   19And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his seed after him.

   20And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make him a great nation.

   21But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.

   22And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. </description>

Passage John 1 :
John 1

   1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

   2The same was in the beginning with God.

   3All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

   4In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

   5And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

   6There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

   7The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.

   8He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

   9That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

   10He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

   11He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

   12But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:

   13Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

   14And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

   15John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.

   16And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

   17For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

   18No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

   19And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?

   20And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

   21And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

   22Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?

   23He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

   24And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.

   25And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?

   26John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;

   27He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

   28These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

   29The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

   30This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.

   31And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

   32And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.

   33And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

Passage John 1 :
John 1

   1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

   2The same was in the beginning with God.

   3All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.

   4In him was life; and the life was the light of men.

   5And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.

   6There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.

   7The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.

   8He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.

   9That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.

   10He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

   11He came unto his own, and his own received him not.

   12But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:

   13Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.

   14And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.

   15John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me: for he was before me.

   16And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.

   17For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.

   18No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.

   19And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?

   20And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ.

   21And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.

   22Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?

   23He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

   24And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.

   25And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?

   26John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there standeth one among you, whom ye know not;

   27He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.

   28These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.

   29The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world.

   30This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is preferred before me: for he was before me.

   31And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

   32And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.

   33And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.

      <description>Step 9: Made direct amends to such people whenever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.
Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.
Matthew 5:23&#8211;24
 
As we grow as Christians and as we grow in our recovery, we want to follow the guidance and directions of Jesus Christ. As we get to know Him better, we want to model His teachings and model His ways. We want to become more like Him. Honestly, if we are going to implement Principle 6 to the best of our ability, we need to learn to model God&#8217;s grace. But how?
Let&#8217;s look at tonight&#8217;s acrostic: GRACE.
God&#8217;s gift
Received by our faith
Accepted by God&#8217;s love
Christ paid the price
Everlasting gift
The G in grace is GOD&#8217;S gift
Grace is a gift. Grace cannot be bought. It is freely given by God to you and me. When we offer (give) our amends and expect nothing back, that&#8217;s a gift from us to those whom we have hurt.
Romans 3:24 (ncv) tells us, &#8220;All need to be made right with God by his grace, which is a free gift. They need to be made free from sin through Jesus Christ.&#8221;
First Peter 1:13 (ncv) says, &#8220;Prepare your minds for service and have self-control. All your hope should be for the gift of grace that will be yours when Jesus Christ is shown to you.&#8221;
If my relationship with God was dependent on my being perfect, I would have trouble relating to God most of the time. Thank God that my relationship with Him is built on His grace and love for me. He gives the strength to make the amends and offer the forgiveness that Principle 6 requires.
And how do we receive God&#8217;s gift of grace? That&#8217;s the R in grace: RECEIVED by our faith.
No matter how hard we may work, we cannot earn our way into heaven. Only by professing our faith in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior can we experience His grace and have eternal life.
Ephesians 2:8&#8211;9 says, &#8220;For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith&#8212;and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God&#8212;not by works, so that no one can boast.&#8221;
Let me share another verse with you. Philippians 3:9 (tlb) states, &#8220;No longer counting on being saved by being good enough or by obeying God&#8217;s laws, but by trusting Christ to save me; for God&#8217;s way of making us right with himself depends on faith&#8212;counting on Christ alone.&#8221;
You and I tend to be more interested in what we do. God is more interested in what we are.
Romans 5:2 says of Jesus, &#8220;Through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God.&#8221;
Just a word of warning: Our walk needs to match our talk. Our beliefs and values are seen by others in our actions. And it is through our faith in Christ that we can find the strength and courage needed for us to take the action Principle 6 requires: making your amends and offering your forgiveness.
The next letter in grace is A. We are ACCEPTED by God&#8217;s love.
God loved you and me while we were still out there sinning. Romans 5:8 says, &#8220;God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.&#8221;
We can, in turn, love others because God first loved us. We can also forgive others because God first forgave us. Colossians 3:13 (tlb) says, &#8220;Be gentle and ready to forgive; never hold grudges. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.&#8221;
Ephesians 2:5 (ncv) reminds us that &#8220;Though we were spiritually dead because of the things we did against God, he gave us new life with Christ. You have been saved by God&#8217;s grace.&#8221;
I don&#8217;t know about you, but I know that I do not deserve God&#8217;s love. But the good news is He accepts me in spite of myself! He sees all my failures and loves me anyway. And the same goes for you.
Hebrews 4:16 (ncv) tells us, &#8220;Let us, then, feel very sure that we can come before God&#8217;s throne where there is grace. There we can receive mercy and grace to help us when we need it.&#8221;
Let&#8217;s move on to the C in grace: Christ paid the price.
Jesus died on the cross so that all our sins, all our wrongs, are forgiven. He paid the price, sacrificed Himself for you and me so that we may be with Him forever.
When we accept Christ&#8217;s work on the cross, we are made a new creation. We can then rely on God&#8217;s strength and power to enable us to forgive those who have hurt us. We can set aside our selfishness and speak the truth in love. We focus only on our part in making amends or offering our forgiveness.
Ephesians 1:7 (ncv) says, &#8220;In Christ we are set free by the blood of his death, and so we have forgiveness of sins. How rich is God&#8217;s grace.&#8221;
The last letter in grace is E: God&#8217;s grace is an EVERLASTING gift.
Once you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, God&#8217;s gift of grace is forever.
Let me read a quote from the Big Book of AA, pages 83&#8211;84: &#8220;Once you have completed Step Nine, you will know a new freedom and a new happiness.... you will comprehend the word serenity and know peace.... You will suddenly realize that God is doing for you what you could not do for yourself.&#8221;
And here&#8217;s a quote from the real Big Book&#8212;the Bible: &#8220;And I am sure that God who began the good work within you will keep right on helping you grow in his grace until his task within you is finally finished on that day when Jesus Christ returns&#8221; (Philippians 1:6 tlb).
Also, 2 Thessalonians 2:16 (ncv) states, &#8220;May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father encourage you and strengthen you in every good thing you do and say. God loved us, and through his grace he gave us a good hope and encouragement that continues forever.&#8221;
My life verse is 1 Peter 2:9&#8211;10 (tlb), where God says, &#8220;For you have been chosen by God himself&#8212;you are priests of the King, you are holy and pure, you are God&#8217;s very own&#8212;all this so that you may show to others how God called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light. Once you were less than nothing; now you [John Baker] are God&#8217;s own. Once you knew very little of God&#8217;s kindness; now your very lives have been changed by it.&#8221;
I stand before you as a product of God&#8217;s grace. Everyone here this evening who has let Christ into his or her life is also a product of God&#8217;s grace. As we model this grace, we will be able to do the work that Principle 6 requires.
Let&#8217;s close tonight with Colossians 1:6: &#8220;All over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood God&#8217;s grace in all its truth.&#8221;

Step 8: We made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.
Do to others as you would have them do to you.
Luke 6:31
 
Evaluate all my relationships. Offer forgiveness to those who have hurt me and make amends for harm I&#8217;ve done to others, except when to do so would harm them or others.
Happy are the merciful.
Happy are the peacemakers.
We started doing repair work on the personal side of our lives earlier in our recovery by admitting our powerlessness, turning our lives and wills over to God&#8217;s care, doing our moral inventory, sharing our sins or wrongs with another, and admitting our shortcomings and asking God to remove them. But now we begin to do some repair work on the relational side of our lives. Making your amends is the beginning of the end of your isolation from God and others.
 
So, in the words of Step 8, it is time to &#8220;make a list of persons that we have harmed and become willing to make amends to them all.&#8221; At this point, you are only looking for the willingness. Step 8 only requires that we identify those to whom we need to make amends or offer forgiveness.
Luke 6:31 reminds us to treat others the way that you want to be treated. For some of you, that may be very difficult. You have been hurt very badly or abused. Many of you had nothing to do with the wrong committed against you.
 
Let&#8217;s look at the second part of Principle 6: &#8220;... make amends for harm I&#8217;ve done to others, except when to do so would harm them or others.&#8221;
Listen as I read Matthew 5:23&#8211;24: &#8220;Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.&#8221;
 answer the question, How do I make AMENDS?
Admit the hurt and the harm
Make a list
Encourage one another
Not for them
Do it at the right time
Start living the promises of recovery
The A is ADMIT the hurt and the harm. Principle 4 showed us how important it is to open up to God and to others. Your feelings have been bottled up far, far too long, and that has interfered with all your important relationships. In this step of your recovery you need to once again face the hurts, resentments, and wrongs others have caused you or that you have caused to others. Holding on to resentments not only blocks your recovery, it blocks God&#8217;s forgiveness in your life.
Luke 6:37 (gnb) tells us, &#8220;Do not judge others, and God will not judge you; do not condemn others, and God will not condemn you; forgive others, and God will forgive you.&#8221;
 
Do you know that you can become addicted to your bitterness, hatred, and revenge, just as you can become addicted to alcohol, drugs, and relationships? A life characterized by bitterness, resentment, and anger will kill you emotionally and shrivel your soul. They will produce the &#8220;Three Ds&#8221;:
Depression
Despair
Discouragement
An unforgiving heart will cause you more pain and destruction than it will ever cause the person who hurt you.
Let&#8217;s move on to the D in amends: DO it at the right time.
This principle not only requires courage, good judgment, and willingness, but a careful sense of timing!
Ecclesiastes 3:1 (tlb) tells us that &#8220;There is a right time for everything.&#8221; There is a time to let things happen and a time to make things happen. There is a right time and a wrong time to offer forgiveness or to make amends.
Before making amends, you need to pray, asking Jesus Christ for His guidance, His direction, and His perfect timing.
Principle 6 goes on to say, &#8220;... except when to do so would harm them or others.&#8221;
Listen to Philippians 2:4: &#8220;Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.&#8221;
Don&#8217;t wait until you feel like making your amends or offering your forgiveness; living this principle takes an act of the will! Or perhaps I should say a crisis of the will. Making your amends is an act of obedience to Scripture and of personal survival.
The last letter in amends is S: START living the promises of recovery.
If we work this principle to the best of our ability, we will be amazed before we are halfway through, when we realize that we know a new freedom and a new happiness. We will no longer regret the past. We have a new understanding of serenity and peace. We will see how our experience with our hurts, hang-ups, and habits can benefit others.
That feeling of uselessness and self-pity will disappear. We will lose interest in selfish things and gain interest in others, causing our self-seeking to slip away. Our whole attitude and outlook on life changes. And suddenly we realize that God is doing for us what we could not do for ourselves!
Let&#8217;s pray.
Dear God, I pray for willingness&#8212;willingness to evaluate all my past and current relationships. Please show me the people that I have hurt, and help me become willing to offer my amends to them. Also, God, give me Your strength to become willing to offer forgiveness to those that have hurt me. I pray for Your perfect timing for taking the action that Principle 6 calls for. I ask all these things in Your Son&#8217;s name, AMEN.</description>

      <itunes:summary>step 8
Step 8: We made a list of all persons we had harmed and became willing to make amends to them all.
Do to others as you would have them do to you.
Luke 6:31
 
Evaluate all my relationships. Offer forgiveness to those who have hurt me and make amends for harm I&#8217;ve done to others, except when to do so would harm them or others.
Happy are the merciful.
Happy are the peacemakers.
We started doing repair work on the personal side of our lives earlier in our recovery by admitting our powerlessness, turning our lives and wills over to God&#8217;s care, doing our moral inventory, sharing our sins or wrongs with another, and admitting our shortcomings and asking God to remove them. But now we begin to do some repair work on the relational side of our lives. Making your amends is the beginning of the end of your isolation from God and others.
 
So, in the words of Step 8, it is time to &#8220;make a list of persons that we have harmed and become willing to make amends to them all.&#8221; At this point, you are only looking for the willingness. Step 8 only requires that we identify those to whom we need to make amends or offer forgiveness.
Luke 6:31 reminds us to treat others the way that you want to be treated. For some of you, that may be very difficult. You have been hurt very badly or abused. Many of you had nothing to do with the wrong committed against you.
 
Let&#8217;s look at the second part of Principle 6: &#8220;... make amends for harm I&#8217;ve done to others, except when to do so would harm them or others.&#8221;
Listen as I read Matthew 5:23&#8211;24: &#8220;Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift.&#8221;
 answer the question, How do I make AMENDS?
Admit the hurt and the harm
Make a list
Encourage one another
Not for them
Do it at the right time
Start living the promises of recovery
The A is ADMIT the hurt and the harm. Principle 4 showed us how important it is to open up to God and to others. Your feelings have been bottled up far, far too long, and that has interfered with all your important relationships. In this step of your recovery you need to once again face the hurts, resentments, and wrongs others have caused you or that you have caused to others. Holding on to resentments not only blocks your recovery, it blocks God&#8217;s forgiveness in your life.
Luke 6:37 (gnb) tells us, &#8220;Do not judge others, and God will not judge you; do not condemn others, and God will not condemn you; forgive others, and God will forgive you.&#8221;
 
Do you know that you can become addicted to your bitterness, hatred, and revenge, just as you can become addicted to alcohol, drugs, and relationships? A life characterized by bitterness, resentment, and anger will kill you emotionally and shrivel your soul. They will produce the &#8220;Three Ds&#8221;:
Depression
Despair
Discouragement
An unforgiving heart will cause you more pain and destruction than it will ever cause the person who hurt you.
Let&#8217;s move on to the D in amends: DO it at the right time.
This principle not only requires courage, good judgment, and willingness, but a careful sense of timing!
Ecclesiastes 3:1 (tlb) tells us that &#8220;There is a right time for everything.&#8221; There is a time to let things happen and a time to make things happen. There is a right time and a wrong time to offer forgiveness or to make amends.
Before making amends, you need to pray, asking Jesus Christ for His guidance, His direction, and His perfect timing.
Principle 6 goes on to say, &#8220;... except when to do so would harm them or others.&#8221;
Listen to Philippians 2:4: &#8220;Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.&#8221;
Don&#8217;t wait until you feel like making your amends or offering your forgiveness; living this principle takes an act of the will! Or perhaps I should say a crisis of the will. Making your a(continued)</itunes:summary>

Genesis 3

   1Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?

   2And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:

   3But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.

   4And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:

   5For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.

   6And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

   7And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.

   8And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.

   9And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou?

   10And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.

   11And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?

   12And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.

   13And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.

   14And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:

   15And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

   16Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.

   17And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;

   18Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field;

   19In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.

   20And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.

   21Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of skins, and clothed them.

   22And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:

   23Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.

   24So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</description>

Romans 15

   1We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.

   2Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification.

   3For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.

   4For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.

   5Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:

   6That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

   7Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.

   8Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:

   9And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.

   10And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.

   11And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.

   12And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.

   13Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.

   14And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.

   15Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,

   16That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.

   17I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.

   18For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,

   19Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.

   20Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

   21But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

   22For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.

   23But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;

   24Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.

   25But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

   26For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

   27It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.

   28When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

   29And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

   30Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;

   31That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;

   32That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.

   33Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.

   20Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:

   21But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.

   22For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.

   23But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;

   24Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.

   25But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.

   26For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.

   27It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.

   28When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.

   29And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.

   30Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;

Podcasting is the method of distributing multimedia files, such as audio programs or music videos, over the Internet for playback on mobile devices and personal computers. The distribution format of a podcast uses either the RSS or Atom syndication formats.

The term podcast, like &quot;radio&quot;, can mean both the content and the method of delivery. The host or author of a podcast is often referred to as a &quot;podcaster&quot;.

Podcasters' web sites may also offer direct download or streaming of their files, however a podcast is distinguished by its ability to be downloaded automatically using software capable of reading RSS or Atom feeds.

Usually the podcast features one type of &quot;show&quot;, with new episodes either sporadically or at planned intervals, such as daily or weekly. In addition to this, there are podcast networks that feature multiple shows on the same feed.

Podcasting's essence is about creating content (audio or video) for an audience that wants to listen or watch when they want, where they want, and how they want.

Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.

   2Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.

   3For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:

   4For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.

   5Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.

   6For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.

   7Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.

   8Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.

   9For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

   10Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.

   11And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.

   12The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.

   13Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.

   14But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.

Romans 12

   1I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.

   2And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.

   3For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.

   4For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:

   5So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.

   6Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;

   7Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;

   8Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.

   9Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.

   10Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;

   11Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;

   12Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;

   13Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.

   14Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.

   15Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.

   16Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.

   17Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.

   18If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.

   19Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.

   20Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.

   21Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</description>

Romans 11
I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.

   2God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel saying,

   3Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.

   4But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.

   5Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.

   6And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.



   7What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded.

   8(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.

   9And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:

   10Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.

   11I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.

   12Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?

   13For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:

   14If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.

   15For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?

   16For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.

   17And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;

   18Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.

   19Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.

   20Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:

   21For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.

   22Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

   23And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graff them in again.

   24For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?

   25For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.

   26And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:

   27For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.

   28As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.

   29For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

   30For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:

   31Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.

   32For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.

   33O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!

   34For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?

   35Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?

   36For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

   17And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;

   18Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.

   19Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.

   20Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:

   21For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.

   22Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.

   23And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graff them in again.

   24For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?

   25For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.

   26And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:

   27For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.

   28As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.

   29For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.

Romans 10

   1Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.

   2For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.

   3For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.

   4For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.

   5For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.

   6But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down from above:)

   7Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)

   8But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;

   9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

   10For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.

   11For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.

   12For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.

   13For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.

   14How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?

   15And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!

   16But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?

   17So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

   18But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

   19But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.

   20But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.

   21But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</description>

Romans 3

   1What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?

   2Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.

   3For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?

   4God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.

   5But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)

   6God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?

   7For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?

   8And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.

   9What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;

   10As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:

   11There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.

   12They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

   13Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:

   14Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:

   15Their feet are swift to shed blood:

   16Destruction and misery are in their ways:

   17And the way of peace have they not known:

   18There is no fear of God before their eyes.

   19Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

   20Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.

   21But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;

   22Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:

   23For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;

   24Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:

   25Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;

   26To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.

   27Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.

   28Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.

   29Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:

   30Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.

   31Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.

leviticus 4

   1And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   2Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:

   3If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.

   4And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

   5And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

   6And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.

   7And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   8And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

   9And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,

   10As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.

   11And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

   12Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

   13And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

   14When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

   15And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.

   16And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

   17And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

   18And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   19And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.

   20And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

   21And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.

   22When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;

   23Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:

   24And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it is a sin offering.

   25And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.

   26And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.

   27And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be guilty;

   28Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned

leviticus 4

   1And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

   2Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:

   3If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.

   4And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

   5And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

   6And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.

   7And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   8And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

   9And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,

   10As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.

   11And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

   12Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall he be burnt.

   13And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

   14When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

   15And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.

   16And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

   17And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

   18And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   19And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar.

   20And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.

   21And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering for the congregation.

   22When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning things which should not be done, and is guilty;

   23Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:
