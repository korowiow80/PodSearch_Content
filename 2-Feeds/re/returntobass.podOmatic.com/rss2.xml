Hello again, and welcome to my latest podcast, this cast is rather special, earlier this year I lost a very close friend he was like a brother to me, and help to shape the man I am as well as the DJ I&#8217;ve become, taking me to my first gay club in London some 10 years ago,  being as well connected as Clint was within the scene at that time it was not long before I was able to pass my demo on to the guys at Salvation-London, the rest as we say is history, the music featured on this podcast is from a period when myself and Clint did quite a lot of clubbing together, and also represents  my explosion on to the scene, it&#8217;s dedicated to one of the best friends I&#8217;ve ever known and will never forget. I love you brother.....I know your Bumping to these Tracks.........

Mr James Brown and ending the Chapter with some Turkish Funk from Mr Mustafa Ozkent. I have tried to delve a little deeper to give you even more pieces that are almost impossible to find on vinyl or download on the internet. Sit back and let the music set the scene and take you right back to the late 60&#8217;s early 70&#8217;s, when even the way people spoke was made up of Soul/Funk (Jive)..... I&#8217;ll be bringing you NS.S.F - VOL 3 in July. Watch out for next month&#8217;s podcast &#8211; REGGAE VOL 1 ft. Special Guest DJ DEXTROUS....It&#8217;s going to be awesome don&#8217;t miss it....Enjoy...xx</description>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1264023/600x600_2603077.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello everyone, and welcome to the bonus editions, these podcasts are extra podcasts that I will be uploading alongside the  main monthly podcasts,  just a little extra music to tickle the taste buds.

This first bonus edition is entitled I&#8217;M STAYING IN TONIGHT/ANYONE WANNA BUMP? And is mainly for those deep house heads who still want that bump but are too attached to Facebook and Twitter to actually venture far from the computer.  

There is no real order to the grooves in this podcast, the records are simply compiled  from the way we were feeling on the night, the tracks do have 1 thing in common with each other THE BUMP, there is no order to the year of the tracks chosen either, but all are from within the last decade, put it on the iPod or simply enjoy at home either way  your body will want to move to these grooves.....enjoy

All tracks compiled from the original LPs &amp; 7&quot; Vinyl&#8217;s (please excuse the crackles)  a compilation of this magnitude would cost a small fortune, as a DJ and an avid record collector I have for many years been asked to put together CD&#8217;s for friends, now I feel it&#8217;s time to share with a wider audience. I do hope that you enjoy this first volume of Northern Soul/Soul/Funk there will be more volumes to accompany this series and I will also be adding Classic House/Techno/Balearic and Rare Jazz/Jazz Funk including some of the funkiest Film Soundtracks known to man, I do hope you will Enjoy my collection over this coming year as much as I have enjoyed collecting them over the last 30 years....

I&#8217;ll be uploading a post EVERY month, for a year..... With special guests and bonus podcasts to keep your taste buds lubricated!</description>
