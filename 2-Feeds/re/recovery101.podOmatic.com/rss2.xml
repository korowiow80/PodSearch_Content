      <title>Using Dreams</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/1044800/600x600_5819013.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recovery 101 Radio is a recovery radio program based loosely on 12 step recovery programs. The format is less like a meeting and more like going to coffee afterward. The &quot;Meeting AFTER the meeting&quot; as it were.
&lt;br&gt; This episode we join Bruce, Shelly, and guest host Marty as they broadcast from the world famous Laguna Beach studio! We join them as they discuss their normal 15 minutes of crap mixed with 15 minutes of recovery!
&lt;br&gt;This episode we talk about using dreams! Are they freebies? Do the freak you out? Do you have to check to make sure that you're still clean and sober? What do YOU think? See what WE think! The Boozy Newz and all the other crap you've come to love or hate!
&lt;br&gt;

The videos are at http://youtube.com/easylook and http://youtube.com/recovery101rule62 ...And Of Course All The Other Insanity You've Come To Expect!

 This episode we join Bruce, Shelly, and Mark as they broadcast from the world famous Laguna Beach studio! We join them as they discuss their normal 15 minutes of crap mixed with 15 minutes of recovery!
This episode we talk about people saying &quot;You'd Drink Too...if you had MY problems...&quot; Have you ever heard THAT one before? Like there's a good reason to actually get loaded. What do YOU think? See what WE think! The Boozy Newz and all the other crap you've come to love or hate!
