      <title>Rendal's Thoughts #3-Second Life And WoW Argent Dawn thoughts</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_3798680.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well not probably anything deep, just talking about drama and how it has ruined a lot of fun I have had in both games.

With Second Life, oddly enough success is part of the problem. Lost Angels started on the Satellite sim and was limited to 40 people. If you weren't one of them you stood at the border waiting for someone to leave or crash to get in. Because of that drama and fighting was controlled a bit.

Now LA is on its own sim, with several other sims bordering that can be easily crossed. thus when people have issues it can easily blow out of control.

With Argent Dawn, Mainly my portion here is talking about regretting letting others control where I play.

I was a member of the Alliance guild the Agency, controlled by Davnika. It was a good guild if somewhat notorious. I liked the people and wish now I wouldn't have stopped playing. By the time I gave up caring the guild had changed a lot. I don't even know if it still exists.

On the horde side My character Sylvestria met a lady named Zahrah and I enjoyed being with her. She showed me a couple places in the game I sill think of as special, one being the zone next to Tristfall Glades where the Tower is. I have tried writing to her to apologize for leaving but I never expect to hear back.

If I could go back in time I would in the case of argent Dawn. La is doomed due to its success and nothing will change that. I will be around as long as it will be.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Rant-You're Dying Joey Bucheker...Really?</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_3751169.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so sick of this. I heard on the podcast &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.visitnowhere.com&quot;&gt;Greetings from Nowhere&lt;/A&gt; that a podcast one of the hosts liked is up for a podcast award. Hey good for them. I even got invited to a group about voting for them which I thought the lady created. So I voted once out of respect to a friend.

Then the spam started. Every day I got a reminder to vote. I just ignored most of them since I didn't care as I'd never listened.

Then I got one today, the title? &quot;Dear Friends, I'm Dying&quot;. I blinked and clicked it to find the rest of the sentence, &quot;To win the Podcast Awards.&quot;

OK Joey that did it. I don't care what your thought process, if you had one, for that was but that pissed me off. That is spam on the level of penis enlargement or breast enhancement. It was a title for shock value to pull the reader into the message. I have done internet marketing so I know that trick well, though I never resorted to that.

I don't honestly care if Cocktails and Cream Puffs wins or comes in dead last, And now thanks to that I don't care if I ever hear of them again.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Thoughts #2- World of Warcraft, The Shattering</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_3710094.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the break, I've had trouble being sick a lot lately, usually with a bad cough so doing this was rather difficult.

Today I talk about the WoW event the Shattering and its affect on the alliance Capital Stormwind. The effect being, the Park got morphed into a barracks and destroyed, A queen I didn't even know was there to begin with died, and everyone else went back to work like nothing happened.

All of the NPC's are still there, all saying the same thing. I know after a while you have to move on but aside from a cemetery which honestly could house every NPC in it, nothing much has changed but the design of the city itself.

It took completely destroying a town (Auberdine) to even get any of the NPC's there to change what shows up when you talk to them.

Back to Stormwind, we were told time would have passed, if so why have none of the NPC's aged? The two sets of boys who fish are still as they were. Old Emma is still just as she was. the only thing that changed is a couple kids changed places. Where it was a boy who was being chased by a girl over a doll, now it is the boy chasing her over a toy gorilla.

Come on Blizzard, is that what you call change?</description>

      <title>Rendal's Thoughts #1-Linda Mcmahon remember your manners</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_3314624.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rendal's Thoughts will be replacing Rendal's Ravings. there will be not set time for these, they will be done as the mood hits.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ctpost.com/default/article/Best-and-the-rest-of-the-past-week-622398.php&quot;&gt;Linda McMahon Comments on Lance Cade&#8217;s Passing&lt;/A&gt;

OK the first topic of Rendal's thoughts will be manners. Apparently either this or common sense is something lacking in Linda McMahon. 

Now I'm not knocking her for not immediately remembering a wrestler, even if they were a tag champion for some time, when someone puts her on the spot. Now what gets me are the following lines, which I doubt sounded any better at the time than it does now.

Linda said WWE can no more be held accountable for deaths of talents &#8220;than a studio could have prevented Heath Ledger&#8217;s death.&#8221;

&#8220;Who knows what causes people to have addictions and do what they do?&#8221;

Apparently Linda wasn't listening when her mom gave her a very good bit of advice so I'll refresh her memory with two words for her, Shut Up.

One of the golden rules is if you can't say something nice don't say anything at all. Now while this rule is rarely followed there are times, like when talking about someone recently deceased that common courtesy tends to say err on the side of caution.

Now how can Linda avoid a snafu like this again? Well that is quite easy. Assign one of her team to monitor the web, Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lordsofpain.net&quot;&gt;Lords of Pain&lt;/A&gt; for news of deaths in the industry. If someone who worked for the WWE/WWF dies then have them get a couple of photos along with a brief synopsis of what they accomplished in their time in the company. It would also be good to do this for well known people who may not have wrestled for them just so they can be up on the news. This way when someone asks her the question again she will at least have some facts to use in her answer.

No charge.</description>

Champions Online, In my mind what an MMO should be. Speyeder Farina being a fun character to play. All the possibilities of crafting and evolving your hero. My new 

character &lt;a href=&quot;http://champions-online.com/character_profiles/2519970/&quot;&gt;Cylver&lt;/A&gt;.

World of Warcraft...Meh. I used to like it when I had the possibility of being able to run with someone, but being on my own its just not fun anymore. that and having 

way to many characters makes it hard to think of who I should play as.

Second Life, Trying to get back into it. GM meeting, other driders in city of Lost Angels. Wonder what happens to people when they disappear.

Adult movies, a good idea they have in showing scenes from movies in bonus sections. Though the good idea gets messed up when they neglect to tell you what the movie is. Also that they have some good music with their stuff.

Which brings us to wrestling, which also now gets some good reviews on its music though it hasn't always been that way.

      <title>Rendal's Thoughts March 12, 2010 (FooPets is Fubared, Zynga games trick)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2577531.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why there is no file with Monday's podcast post.

FooPets is Fubared

OK FooPets we get the point, you have a hardon for flash. The problem is Flash tends to make things crawl. You have 4 active flash points as well as the Meebo bar and now its taking me twice as long to do anything.

Solution: Give us a way to turn them off. If you need help look at forums. they have a way to change the whole look just with a click. It would save your users a lot of time.

Trick on Zynga games

OK I found a nice trick in Zynga games on Facebook. If you need something, send it to someone as a free gift. This obviously works better the more friends you have. Need a mission item in Vampire wars? Something for your Farmville stables, or maybe just want to get more of the special items? Send them to your game friends. If they haven't sent you something they have an option to send a thank you gift, which is sending back what you gave them.

Cafe World

As with FooPets, Cafe World seems to have a love for making things grind. It takes me a couple minutes just to get everything loaded. That doesn't exactly scream fun times to me.

FB Games

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/matthew.ulmen&quot;&gt;My profile on Facebook&lt;/A&gt;-If you want to add me as a friend for one of the games.

Laughing at more proof of Beth Phoenix's Ego-&quot;I'm told I hurt Chyna's feelings with my comments. Oops!&quot;

Beth Phoenix wrote the following on Twitter yesterday: &quot;just got pulled over while driving to Dallas by a Walker Texas Ranger wannabe. he wrote me a ticket. I gave him the Glamastare..he cried.&quot;-Most likely due to laughter.

Why Beth has to do this when she is a wonderful wrestler I have no clue.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 12, 2010 (Ludvig Borga dies, WWE name change)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2522209.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is another wrestling day, but not about the shows or the current talent.

I start off today talking about the death of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludvig_Borga&quot;&gt;Tony Halme (aka Ludvig Borga)&lt;/A&gt;. I honestly don't remember much about him as he wrestled in WWF 17 years ago. I do remember liking his character and finding him impressive in the ring. This is finishing a three parter of him, Steve &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Williams and Eddie &quot;Umaga&quot; Fatu. Hopefully we will have a break now.

The second thing is regarding this quote made in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://magazine.continental.com/201001-idea-makers&quot;&gt;Continental Airlines Magazine article&lt;/A&gt; talking about women in power in the WWE:

&lt;i&gt;&quot;There are two things WWE wants you to know. First, the operative word is &quot;entertainment,&quot; not &quot;wrestling.&quot; Second, watch how you refer to the talent. They're not wrestlers; the men are &quot;superstars&quot; and the women &quot;divas.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;

So looking at that, the WWE doesn't see itself in the wrestling business. So, time for a name change. From here on out I'll be referring to it as Whole World Entertainment. I thought of World Wide entertainment, going back to the WWWF roots, but someone has that name already. I suggest everyone start using that name since they don't want to be associate with it. They shouldn't care right? They aren't in wrestling. They don't call their athletes wrestlers. They just pointed that out themselves. If they want to pay me I'll take .1% of sales on the WWE logo. :)

Why this sudden shift? I have a couple ideas. First off wrestler deaths. In the past couple months we have lost the three above plus Captain Louis Albano. Ludvig Borga aside those are some big names.

Second, Linda McMahon. She is running for Senate and I'm sure won't want her career in a wrestling organization, especially one that has done the angles they have, studied or brought out to much. This is the same Linda who pretended to be in a wheel chair while her husband pretended to have an affair in front of her. Good quality TV there.

Third, Drugs. Entertainers use drugs all the time. That's par of their life style. I'm not saying everyone does, just that it is accepted. You can't do that in sports. So with their drug policies not doing much good might as well shift to a industry where stuff like that is accepted.

That is my show this week. Yes it was wrestling again but I think with good reason.

      <itunes:summary>Today is another wrestling day, but not about the shows or the current talent.

I start off today talking about the death of Tony Halme (aka Ludvig Borga). I honestly don't remember much about him as he wrestled in WWF 17 years ago. I do remember liking his character and finding him impressive in the ring. This is finishing a three parter of him, Steve &quot;Dr. Death&quot; Williams and Eddie &quot;Umaga&quot; Fatu. Hopefully we will have a break now.

The second thing is regarding this quote made in a Continental Airlines Magazine article talking about women in power in the WWE:

&quot;There are two things WWE wants you to know. First, the operative word is &quot;entertainment,&quot; not &quot;wrestling.&quot; Second, watch how you refer to the talent. They're not wrestlers; the men are &quot;superstars&quot; and the women &quot;divas.&quot;

So looking at that, the WWE doesn't see itself in the wrestling business. So, time for a name change. From here on out I'll be referring to it as Whole World Entertainment. I thought of World Wide entertainment, going back to the WWWF roots, but someone has that name already. I suggest everyone start using that name since they don't want to be associate with it. They shouldn't care right? They aren't in wrestling. They don't call their athletes wrestlers. They just pointed that out themselves. If they want to pay me I'll take .1% of sales on the WWE logo. :)

Why this sudden shift? I have a couple ideas. First off wrestler deaths. In the past couple months we have lost the three above plus Captain Louis Albano. Ludvig Borga aside those are some big names.

Second, Linda McMahon. She is running for Senate and I'm sure won't want her career in a wrestling organization, especially one that has done the angles they have, studied or brought out to much. This is the same Linda who pretended to be in a wheel chair while her husband pretended to have an affair in front of her. Good quality TV there.

Third, Drugs. Entertainers use drugs all the time. That's par of their life style. I'm not saying everyone does, just that it is accepted. You can't do that in sports. So with their drug policies not doing much good might as well shift to a industry where stuff like that is accepted.

That is my show this week. Yes it was wrestling again but I think with good reason.

If you like wrestling go listen to Cornette's Commentary (PodOMatic Search link) from the Who's Slamming Who podcast. I quote him a lot in this one :). Since I'm advertising for him go to his website at JimCornette.com or get some of his wrestling stuff he has collected over the years at Cornette's Collectables.</itunes:summary>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2500533.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I will say right off I don't miss wrestling any more now than I did going into this. I hadn't watched a full show in many years and neither show gave me any reason to change that.

Yes there was some intrigue with Bret Hart and Ric Flair, but other than that not much.

The match of the night was hands down AJ styles against Kurt angle. Watch it, download it, burn it, hide it and put it in a time capsule. this is why wrestling fans watch wrestling. It is one of the most spectacular matches I've ever seen.

Who won on format, WWE. they had a show, they stuck to it. Nothing felt out of place or seemed like much of a deviation of the product. TNA on the other hand had so much stuff going on the show suffered for a lack of direction.

Matches overall were WWE again. They had more time and while the TNA show had lots of title matches you get the feeling most of the matches could've done much better had time not been wasted backstage.

So while yes Bishoff and Hogan arrived, they seemed to just slip into NWO habits, not caring about anything but screen time and stroking their own ego. I do applaud Hogan for coming out and praising the Styles vs Angle match.

WWE wins, not because they are bigger, not because they had a better guest host, but because they gave people what they wanted and didn't force them to sit through bs that wasn't needed.

I focus on a game featuring pets, dogs and cats, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foopets.com/&quot;&gt;FooPets&lt;/a&gt;. It has real dog and cat breeds, you feed them real food and play with them. Its quite a good game.Below are my stats on it:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foopets.com/pet/6562685&quot;&gt;Spectyr&lt;/A&gt;

I also talk about a site called Free Kibble that you can visit once a day to donate kibble to shelters by answering a daily question. You donate weather you guess right or not.

For Dogs-&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.freekibble.com/&quot;&gt;Free Kibble&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;a lastly another Facebook game I got into after yesterday called &lt;a href=&quot;http://apps.facebook.com/cafeworld/&quot;&gt;Cafe World&lt;/A&gt;. Its got simple graphics, much like Farmville, and is neat to pop into every so often :) I'm Matthew &quot;Raving Rendal&quot; Ulmen on there if you want to add me to be a neighbor.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings December 23, 2009 (World of Warcraft, Mission Creek Players)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2470941.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well this may be an odd thing for a Christmas time show, BUT since I usually do a show after or during Christmas regarding it then it shouldn't be surprising :)

OK primary topic is World of Warcraft, specifically economy. I found it to be quite jarring in difference between two servers. the two I'm comparing are Argent Dawn and Wyrmrest Accord. Argent Dawn has always had problems with two many new people, mainly because of it beginning with an &quot;A&quot;. It is the first server listed in RP servers, Wyrmrest being the last. Just to give you an idea on how this can muck things up try this on.

I checked out the price of a small egg, something I could go and bonk something on the head for and not have much problem. I needed five for a quest to get WoW's version of Santa Clause, Greatfather Winter, some gingerbread cookies. Now on Argent Dawn I check and the price for ONE egg was either fifty gold or ninety gold. To those scratching their heads right now, gold is the highpoint of money going from copper, to silver to gold. 100 copper=1 silver, 100 silver=1 gold. Now keep in mind anyone from level 5 on up can get a small egg no problem, 50 gold however, impossible. 

Now on Wyrmrest I checked and I got 5 eggs for 1 gold. I saved a  minimum of two hundred and twenty four gold, just by being on a server at the bottom of the RP list. It would be interesting to go through them and see if that is a trend, if as you go up from Wyrmrest things get more expensive. 

Warcraft has been a favorite of mine since I got the Warcraft II Battle.net CD, so I'll never leave it, though I still think the best fun to be had is Warcraft III Corridor maps. I can play those for hours :)

Other note is I now consider myself officially a member of Wenatchee's Mission Creek Players. I was present from Rehersal, to show and take down on Farndale's  A Christmas Carol. I never missed a show, and have a great time. I also got asked if I would be interesting in being part of a play the director is thinking of proposing for next season. Granted this was just a thought, but that says to me they know I'm serious now about wanting to be a part of things. it's a good feeling to be a part of something again.

That's it for this show, have a good holiday season :).</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings December 15, 2009 (Reaction to Furrydom, Jim Cornette, Wrestling)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2446327.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the break but lately its getting hard for me to think of what to say. This may end up being more of a situational podcast than a regular one.

First up, one of the things that got me to do this is a reaction I got from people when I admitted I considered myself a furry. We had been talking and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ranting-gryphon.com/&quot;&gt;2, The Ranting Gryphon&lt;/a&gt; came up. they asked if I was furry and I said yes. then they looked at me weird. &quot;Are you into plushophilia?&quot; My response wasn't the best &quot;God no have you seen what they do to those poor things?&quot;

I'll let you find out what plushophilia is, sufficed to say they were worried I was a person who couldn't tell the difference between reality and fantasy. apparently one of them had dated such a girl and now they look at everyone as a possible person like her. 

This is a problem the fandom has been having for a long time. We have so much shit piled on us that when people find out your Furry they don't quite act right. I think a lot of it is because, unlike homosexual or transgendered or such where you can look them up and get a clear idea of what they are, being furry varies from person to person. 

Some see it as a sexual thing, others more of a spiritual thing. and of course with sex being involved we have our well known offshoots of plushophilia and zoophilia. both of which make it ten times harder to be taken as a serious person.

Anyway that is one of the things that got me thiking about doing a show. the other was Jim Cornette's &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.jimcornette.com/Commentary.html&quot;&gt;Contract with the fans&lt;/a&gt;, something he also covered on his &lt;a href=&quot;http://whosslammingwho.podomatic.com/entry/2009-12-08T11_19_24-08_00&quot;&gt;podcast&lt;/a&gt; segment on &lt;A href=&quot;http://whosslammingwho.podomatic.com/&quot;&gt;Who's Slamming Who?&lt;/A&gt;.

It boils down to this. Jim Cornette, having nothing to do now with TNA apologized to the fans for his actions of working for the money instead of for the betterment of the business. He also talked about the reactions to wrestling he has heard from some people.

I'm one of the ones who only watches wrestling on you tube or other sites. I can't bring myself to watch them on TV. I just have had enough of the bull shit. The kicker for me was Hunter Hearst Helmsley ruining the wedding of Andrew &quot;Test&quot; Martin and Stephanie McMahon. They built it up very well, roped everyone in and then shit on it. 

I don't care anymore about it. I'll watch what I want and just ignore the rest. The one moment I found that gave me a hint of what I used to like about wrestling came when I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x47ew9_john-cena-returns-royal-rumble-2008_sport&quot;&gt;John Cena's return at 2008's Royal Rumble&lt;/A&gt;. I can't explain why. I watched it originally to see the confrontation between &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper and Jimmy &quot;Superfly&quot; Snuka. then as the show wound down and hit number 30 I heard Cena's music, which I honestly didn't know at the time. The crowd reacted and I got , and still get, the shiver down my spine that someone special was coming. 

I don't know where WWE is going. I like Sheamus, and got to see one of my dream matches with him and Finlay. I am surprised they didn't have a match with him last night though think that may have extended his reign. If they screw him over his best bet is to go back to ECW and &quot;Claim it is his own&quot;.

That's it from me this week. Have a god holiday season if you don't hear from me :)</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings November 24, 2009 (The Mission Creek Players &quot;Farndale's A Christmas Carol&quot;)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2381058.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a local subject, but I'm allowed those now and then.

I am doing sound for the &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.ncwtheater.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=56&quot;&gt;Mission Creek Players&lt;/a&gt; performance of &quot;Farndale's A Christmas Carol&quot;. It is turning out to be a fun introduction to theater work. I haven't done anything in a theatrical production before and I'm looking forward to seeing it through. My main fear is finally getting sick :P.

The play is about a troupe doing the Christmas Carol play and the fun that comes along with it. Many things go wrong and characters are as often arguing with each other as &quot;acting&quot;. There are a couple of music spots too which should be expected in a Christmas show. The dates for attending are below:

Show Only: November 27 &amp; 28, Tickets $12

Dinner and Show , Tickets $25:

December: 4&amp;5, 11&amp;12, 18&amp;19

I'll be talking about this I'm sure until it is over :)

In other internet news I'm still off and on Second Life as Speyeder Farina though lately I've been on World of Warcraft as either &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Wyrmrest+Accord&amp;n=Kheloria&quot;&gt;Kheloria&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Wyrmrest+Accord&amp;n=Keirian&quot;&gt;Keirian&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings November 17, 2009 (Repo! The Genetic Opera vs Rocky Horror Picture Show)</title>
      <description>Yes I finally found my microphone. A bit bittersweet as I mentioned before with the FBC disappearing. So now I'm one of many who record then post with no live show, yet. The levels are weird, a lot of background noise for some reason, I'm working on it.

I have a domain now I use to broadcast my show on SL and may use that. I'll probably keep the times close to what they were, more for ease on my part so I don't have to adjust. I'll know more next week.

I also, thanks to said domain, may put up the archives again. Yes they are on PodOmatic but you can't be to safe :)

OK today its comparison time; &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0963194/&quot;&gt;Repo:The Genetic Opera&lt;/a&gt; vs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073629/&quot;&gt;Rocky Horror Picture Show&lt;/a&gt;. 

Starting out with what is similar. Both are musicals obviously. Both have a darker atmosphere, and both have a character who regularly talk to the audience. That's about it honestly.

For Rocky Horror: The movie is campy and it does it very well. Everyone hams up their parts when need be and while it doesn't seem possible, it still makes Brad &amp; Janet's reactions funny, in an awkward kind of way. 

The music is good though little of it strays from the camp. &quot;I'm Going Home&quot; is the only one that tries going in any serious direction that I can recall. Again the movie is campy anyway so that works. The Classic from it is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yarYjuN-m8I&quot;&gt;&quot;Time Warp&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. 

Overall Rocky Horror is a safe bet for watching as even though it strays from comfort sometimes it does it with a smirk you can't ignore.

Now onto Repo: This is a very dark movie, think along the lines of Dark City. While there are some moments that you will chuckle at, there are some that will have you reaching for Kleenex. Many of the jokes may not get a laugh from everyone as they can get rather graphic. The actors though play their parts very well.

The music follows a lot of different styles. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr9wOuXZVDk&quot;&gt;It's a Thankless Job&lt;/A&gt; is a good sign of graphic dark humor, more from the scene accompanying it, while songs like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SO9W0DMjQ_U&quot;&gt;Legal Assassin&lt;/a&gt; are good at showcasing specific characters. Due to its just being released in 2008 its hard to say it has a &quot;Classic&quot; song, though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7AjlT406_s&quot;&gt;Repo Man&lt;/a&gt; seems to be popular with who I talk to.

Overall the characters do a good job on drawing you into their lives. People Like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0372117/&quot;&gt;Anthony Head&lt;/A&gt; (Giles from Buffy the Vampire Slayer Series) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0385296/&quot;&gt;Paris Hilton&lt;/A&gt; surprised me while co-creator and narrator &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0954023/&quot;&gt;Terrance Zdunich&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite due to his ability to both sing and his role as guide in the movie.

I rate Repo! higher than Rocky Horror for one reason. It's got teeth. It doesn't shy at making you feel uncomfortable or angry at the  characters and really blurs the lines between good and evil. While I own Rocky Horror and hope to soon own Repo, I will most likely wear out Repo long before.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings October 27, 2009 (The Fed, Swine Flu, Revelations &amp; Social Security)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2293133.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK first off Talking about an article talking about the Federal Reserve Bank thinking of pulling &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/politico/28677&quot;&gt;One Trillion dollars from the economy&lt;/a&gt;. Now maybe they aren't aware but the economy isn't exactly in a condition that it can shrug off loosing one trillion dollars, but it is still something they are considering. Their defense is worrying about the effects of inflation, not that I don't think anyone takes inflation as a serious threat right now when few people can afford ever basic services easily. I guess it is easy to think of numbers like this when things are digital. Simply clicking the minus sign and entering 1,000,000,000 then enter. Ten, maybe 15 seconds. No wonder things get so easily mucked up

Next is the Oooooooo scary Swine flu, which is now apparently a &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091024/ap_on_he_me/us_obama_swine_flu&quot;&gt;national emergency&lt;/a&gt;. I really wish if the government wanted us to take this seriously that when they post this news they give us more than scare figures. The current ones are one hundred children and one thousand total US citizens have died from it and forty-six states are wide spread infected. Now call me heartless but one thousand, out of two hundred and fifty million? For those at home that's one out of every two hundred and fifty thousand people. That's an epidemic?

Now granted I'm going by the very limited facts they choose to release so I don't know percentages. I did find a &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/&quot;&gt;CDC Flu site&lt;/A&gt; which gives some data but I haven't looked at it to fully comprehend it as I found it while doing the show. I really have to wonder about hysteria moves like this one. I also wonder if it was debated weather or not to election day? Who knows, we only know they won't tell us.

OK I put a break in here where I play the latest from &lt;A href=&quot;http://unclejayexplains.com/2009/10/25/uncle-jay-explains-oct-26-2009/&quot;&gt;Uncle Jay on Political Ads&lt;/a&gt;. In this you hear him listening to a campaign and political referendum ad and he tells you what usually happens. It's quite well done.

Next, time to talk about Revelations. I won't lie I think this is the only book of the Bible I ever read. Why? Its an attention grabber. The person who wrote it, basically was writing down what he saw during a drug trip. Since the visuals were so fantastic people ascribed them to prophecy. Fast forward and people are worried that the events may come to pass and point at various things they believe to be signs. What got me on this is how one person claimed &quot;experts&quot; from all fields believe in this. 

OK I want to meet these &quot;Experts&quot;. I also want to know what does it take to be an expert, a King James and a half formed theory? Heck I must be one then. I look at Revelations as a self fulfilling prophecy. I say that because it seems to me that if you keep looking for things like that and are so anxious to make ties to tings, then your going to end up pushing yourself to those conclusions.  A person on there for once agreed with me which made me feel good. 

One of the things I mention in this line is everyone thinking that there could be another impact on earth that kills of man like it did the dinosaurs. My question, &lt;A href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event&quot;&gt;The Tunguska Event&lt;/A&gt;. Could this be what we were expecting? Could the fact it exploded in the air instead of a ground impact which could've been quite devastating, have spared us this time around? the problem with that is there are people so convinced that such an event will be the end of things that they would rather deny that the world survived one rather than accept it. (&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/missesyounevernow#grid/user/4A239E1BC2E680B5&quot;&gt;Siberian Apocalypse /The Tunguska Event You Tube Playlist&lt;/A&gt;)

On the subject of denial, last topic is Social Security. I've been having a rather stupid problem with them lately. I have a $250 over pay on my check, which for some reason never seems to show up on my paper work when I ask for proof of income. This hits hard on the fact I get food stamps. I used to get one hundred a month which is about right. that can feed me well for one month. Unfortunately someone was using the correct numbers instead of the governments. So now I'm down to sixteen. Why? because Social Security keeps lying about what I'm making. Why they have a rule allowing them to do this I don't know. All I do know is I'm sure I'm not the only one getting screwed like this. I just need to find out how to protest it.

      <title>Rendal's  Ravings October 20, 2009 (Wenatchee, WA Scream World, Heroes &amp; Villians)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2272517.png&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first part of this is off, now the music volume is off. Thankfully it doesn't last long.

OK first off I have a call for help in identifying a movie that creeped into my head this morning. Its a cgi movie about a cop looking into murders and finding them being done by a creature he had fought and thought dead. turns out the chief has kept it sealed up. The creature is a deep red squid creature capable of moving through as easily as water, usually flying. Its going to be fun trying to remember its name :P

Next up is talking about the Wenatchee, WA haunted theater &quot;Scream World&quot;. Anyone who knows me knows that getting in front of people isn't something I'm exactly fond of, so finding myself as a monster that everyone can see and no where for me to hide is quite a leap for me. Now granted the monsters I've done (twice as a Scarecrow and once a Mutant) I have basically sold by being the one your not sure about. I've had several people not know if I was a real person or not. 

This plays up very nicely with a old trick I've had that I don't even have to try to do. I usually breathe very shallowly and so unless you really look sometimes you can't tell if I'm breathing at all. Now factor in poor or discolored lighting and that makes it even harder. As a Scarecrow I had an advantage as I had a burlap sack over my head so I had facial freedom. I didn't have that as a Mutant, that was quite a good feeling when someone would look at me and then have it dawn on them that yes I am alive.

I find I have been bitten by the same bug my sister was, I love being in front of people in this way. I would do this forever if I could. I doubt my time with the Mission Creek Players, ie the group who run Scream World, will stop when it does. I'll be hooked on it, and hopefully I'll be able to continue it without many problems.

I have had one silly moment. at the end of the night the crew come out and to the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Time Warp&lt;/A&gt;. We could only do one this last time due to weather, and I of course made an idiot out of myself. The problem was as a mutant they had me in a jumpsuit about an inch to small all around so movement was a bit of a hassle. Still I knew the song by heart and was anxious to try it. I got to part four, pulling my knees in when my body caught on and hit the stop button by my knee popping. Down I went like a sack of potatoes but I was laughing about it and still had a great time. If that, which before would've killed it for good can't do the job I don't know what would.

Last up is talking about the relationship between Heroes and Villains, specifically the ones where they come to mutually respect each other in a way that see both in their own ways trying to relish in the conflict. A good example is the meeting between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarity in Jeremy Brett's Holmes episode &quot;The Final Problem&quot;. In that both, begrudgingly, admit some form of respect for one another, though also acknowledging they know only one can survive. 

Another is Spider Man and Doctor Octopus. Dr. Octopus at one point discovered Spider Man to be dying of cancer and instead of rejoicing it occurs to him that Spider Man is who keeps him going. After explaining to Spider Man that he has to trust him or resign himself to the fate of dying, he eventually cures him. As the police come to take him away he happily says that now he knows his rival will be there for him that he can handle anything.

The final one is from the movie &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3034708/1/Night_Sabre_Eyes&quot;&gt;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&lt;/A&gt;. In the movie Fu Manchu is forced to gather the ingredients of a new Elixir Vitae, after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0QwZGsLKjw&quot;&gt;A familiar henchman spills his remaining supply&lt;/A&gt;. Though his nemesis Nayland Smith tries to stop him Fu Manchu ultimately is successful and the climax has a young Fu Manchu bringing Nayland to his laboratory. Instead of killing him though, Fu Manchu admits that Nayland has made things worth while, offering him the remaining Elixir so they can continue their game. I play the clip where they talk from the movie, one of my favorite moments in movies.

Thats it until next week.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings October 6, 2009  (Wenatchee, WA Haunted Theater, Best Countries to Live in)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2229880.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well today I'm a bit blah after going to an oriental buffet and eating far more than I'm used to.

First up is the Wenatchee, WA &lt;a href=&quot;http://thecabinet.com/darkdestinations/location.php?sub_id=dark_destinations&amp;letter=h&amp;location_id=haunted_theatre_wenatchee_wa&quot;&gt;Haunted Theater&lt;/a&gt;. I saw a sign outside the Wenatchee Wolrd saying &quot;Monsters Wanted&quot; and how could I not call that? Orientation is tonight and I'll get a look at what is going on. I know I'll do something, it just sounds like to much fun.

Will I be a monster though? I'm not sure. I've never done anything like that with just makeup. I helped play a monster once before getting into a paper mache dragon costume, which was wonderful, and about as I'll ever come to suiting. The other thing I did that same day was play a corpse. they had a nice pine box and I just had to lie still. I was good too, people thought I had fallen asleep. I was so happy when people left and I could grin.

Also looking at the list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nowpublic.com/world/best-place-live-list-countries-2009-un-hdi&quot;&gt;Best Countries to Live&lt;/A&gt; which turned up three surprising place in the top 30:

&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luxembourg&quot;&gt;Luxumbourg&lt;/a&gt; Ranked 11, two spots above the United States 13. Size 998.6 sq mi.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liechtenstein&quot;&gt;Lichtenstein&lt;/A&gt; Ranked 19. Size 62 sq mi. 
And &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunei&quot;&gt;Burnei Darussalam (Brunei)&lt;/A&gt; takes 30. Size 2,226 sq mi.

I just find it funny that three of the smallest nations in the world ended up on there. There are good reasons I'm sure, maybe its more communal there. Still a country the size of Rhode Island beating the US...priceless.

Last up is a link to the &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.electricferret.com/bozo/&quot;&gt;Bozo Criminal of the Day&lt;/a&gt; website. Look up October 6, 2009 if it isn't up there, its absolutely hilarious.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings September 29, 2009 (Furry vs Anthro, Denial, DDO &amp; SL)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2209200.gif&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Denial is the topic of the week. Since this is a furry program I focus on a form I'm seeing of people insisting they are anthropomorphic instead of furry, which is for the most part the same thing.

Anthropomorphic is a creature with humanoid features, abilities, etc. Furry, While being a fan of anthropomorphics, is a very broad definition at times depending on who you ask. For me, as far as Role Play goes, a Furry is a creature with humanoid thought, sentience. 

Yes in that they are different, what gets me though is the anthropomorphics almost disturbing in their insistence not to be called furry. Though if you look at it there is no real difference. They both ultimately take a animal and give it either human qualities or body.

So if the definition of Furry in Role play is taking an animal and giving it human qualities/abilities then sorry anthro's you're not going to win.

Next up is a game update for Dungeons and Dragons Online and Second Life. Still having a lot of fun on DDO, I have two characters now who can get to level 8, which is cool as I can see more of the game. I still want to subscribe if for nothing else to unlock everything and have more room to play around.

Second Life isn't doing to good. I've given Lost Angels one last chance by giving myself a spot in the sim that no one has every used. If I can't do anything with a spot in the town then its over. I don't know about SL so much as LA is done, I can justify sitting and staring at a screen with no movement or purpose.

That's it for this week. 

&lt;a href=&quot;http://fc00.deviantart.com/fs28/f/2008/087/0/9/Furry_VS_anthro_by_LilleahWest.jpg&quot;&gt;Furry Vs Anthro Pic by Lilleah West&lt;/a&gt;-This says it all, to large to post.

      <itunes:summary>Denial is the topic of the week. Since this is a furry program I focus on a form I'm seeing of people insisting they are anthropomorphic instead of furry, which is for the most part the same thing.

Anthropomorphic is a creature with humanoid features, abilities, etc. Furry, While being a fan of anthropomorphics, is a very broad definition at times depending on who you ask. For me, as far as Role Play goes, a Furry is a creature with humanoid thought, sentience. 

Yes in that they are different, what gets me though is the anthropomorphics almost disturbing in their insistence not to be called furry. Though if you look at it there is no real difference. They both ultimately take a animal and give it either human qualities or body.

So if the definition of Furry in Role play is taking an animal and giving it human qualities/abilities then sorry anthro's you're not going to win.

Next up is a game update for Dungeons and Dragons Online and Second Life. Still having a lot of fun on DDO, I have two characters now who can get to level 8, which is cool as I can see more of the game. I still want to subscribe if for nothing else to unlock everything and have more room to play around.

Second Life isn't doing to good. I've given Lost Angels one last chance by giving myself a spot in the sim that no one has every used. If I can't do anything with a spot in the town then its over. I don't know about SL so much as LA is done, I can justify sitting and staring at a screen with no movement or purpose.

That's it for this week.

First off &quot;Tea Partying&quot;. I want to say I don't know why they took this but its obvious as it brings up patriotism in remembering our fight against the British. Problem is the colonists had a good reason behind it, they were being taxed without representation. These people?

This is going t offend some people I'm sure as Cornette doesn't censor himself, but I agree with his points so I'm playing it. There is a text version of this can be found &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.jimcornette.com/Commentary.html&quot;&gt;on Jim Cornette's Web Page&lt;/a&gt;.

Last up I wind down  talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ddo.com&quot;&gt;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online&lt;/a&gt;. I like the game. I would say I love it, but addicted to it would be closer. I'm Speyeder Farina on all the servers so no one can take Speyeder, so drop me a line :)</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings September 15, 2009 (DDO, Jeff Hardy vs Chris Benoit &amp; being a wrestling manager)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2167808.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK First up is Dungeons &amp; Dragons Online, which is free now. You can only go to level 4 and have two characters (per server? haven't tried yet). I'm having fun with it. I have an Elvish Ranger and a Halfling Rogue. Will I pay $15 for an account, oh yeah, just have to work it into the bills.

Played:Zero Punctuation-Wolfenstein Review

The rest of the show is centered around wrestling with the news of Jeff Hardy's drug charges. From what I've heard it was for possession and in the case of opium intent to distribute. 

Now I'm not going to get into drugs being right or wrong, that's up to you, BUT I do have issues with people comparing this to the Benoit murders. I hate that. This is apples and oranges people. Benoit was horrible and even I won't deny that as much as I despise the WWE trying to pretend he no longer exists. He was one of the best wrestlers of his generation who tragically died taking his family with him. 

I'll maintain my point, if  Chris Benoit should be censored after committing murder, will Phil Spector  be if he is convicted of murder? If not why, nothing different except he is still alive.

Played:WWF-Jive Soul Bro  (Slickter's theme)

Wrapping up and keeping on the wrestling theme I would love to be a manager. I have always loved managers, how they can help people who normally wouldn't be able to advance far. How they become a presence of their own through either interviews or actions in the ring or ringside. 

I would probably base myself on four people; Slick, Harvey Whippleman, James Mitchell and Paul E. Dangerously. I would also grab from Jimmy Hart, Bobby Heenan and probably everyone else I could think of because I don't think there is any one manager who didn't have some gift or something that made them their own. 

I don't have a fed around here I can meet and greet at, or know anyone in the business so getting a foot in is probably as likely as getting a jackpot, but still people hold out for those too.

      <description>Well today's show is rather random as I just got back from from Shopping for school supplies and it did not go well. 

My main thing I( wanted to chat about this week is TV. I've gotten back into it again, or three shows of it:&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.history.com/video.do?name=ClashoftheGods&quot;&gt;Clash of the Gods&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.history.com/content/universe&quot;&gt;The Universe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;A href=&quot;http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/mythbusters.html&quot;&gt;Mythbusters&lt;/a&gt;. 

Yeah as you can tell I'm a geek, I love shows like these that help me learn things or are of subjects I like, Astronomy and Mythology two strong ones. Mythbusters I love for the show overall. It is one I look forward to every week.

On &lt;a href=&quot;http://rendalspicks.podomatic.com/&quot;&gt;Rendal's Picks&lt;/A&gt; tomorrow the theme is Not Safe For Work (N.S.F.W.), and after today that would've been it anyway had I not had it planned.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings August 25, 2009 (Blue Coward Democrats &amp; Health Care)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2110258.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm back, I went to visit my folks in Minnesota for a couple weeks and had some fun. I got a new laptop too which I was going to link to but has disappeared of Best Buy's site.

So, I read in Rolling Stone an article by Matt Taibbi about the health care bills going around and a couple things caught my attention,  Firstly this group calling itself Blue Dog Democrats.

The Blue Coward Democrats, which is the name I have given them, is a group of Democrats who have just openly gone with the Democratic promise the moon then cower in Congress creed. This shows up mostly when the Congress and President are two different parties, or when the Congress is split to fine for anything.

Here is where they earn their coward label though. They have a democratic President and a strong Democratic congress. There is nothing stopping the party of making a bill calling for all firstborns, regardless of gender, of being named Sue. But there in lies the problem. The Democrats are so pussy whipped by the Republican party that all they can hope for is their master's consent on trivial things while taking money from everyone who wants things to stay exactly how they are. If the Republican Party to me wasn't so abhorrent I would've joined them long ago as they are the only party who ever seems to accomplish anything.

The other thing is something they talk about and makes me worried. Part of this bill is supposed to be giving choices, but it seems to be ending up on the only choice being how badly you'll be fucked over. I'll use an example instead of rambling. Mitt Romney got a medicare increase in Vermont so more people could join the program, which would be nice IF only for it saying on the other side you got penalized for not being insured. This is is the type of thinking going into this bill, and of course no one can do anything about it. 

So what to do, well that's up to you honestly. It's all of our country swirling down the drain, but if enough of us decide to do something we could stop it yet. Weather it would take contacting you congressman, marching, rioting or even outright domestic terrorism at this point I don't know. I know that they will always have us right where they want us if we don't, begging at the table for scrapes and thinking that this is all it can ever be.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_2033712.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK starting off the show with suggestion time. First off, and the reason for this is Warren Ellis' articles on &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.bleedingcool.com/category/do-anything-by-warren-ellis/&quot;&gt;Bleeding Cool&lt;/a&gt;. If you don't know of Warren he is a comic book writer and his writing outside the medium is unique in that he doesn't only uncensor himself he just writes whatever and hell if you get all of it.

Of course me not able to keep my mind on one thing leads to a couple more website recommendations; &lt;a href=&quot;http://freekibble.com&quot;&gt;Free Kibble&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://freekibblekat.com&quot;&gt;Free Kibble Kat&lt;/a&gt;, two sites who both donate 10 pieces of kibble every day. Also check out their Kibble Kartoons.

And THAT brought up &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehungersite.com&quot;&gt;The Hunger Site&lt;/A&gt;, a site that is also a one click a day and supports:Hunger, Breast Cancer, Child Health, Literacy, the Rainforest and Animal Rescue. Between the three in about 5 minutes you can help a lot of people no matter how rich you are :).

First news bit is an article on &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090728/ap_on_re_us/us_obama_birth_certificate&quot;&gt;Obama's birth Certificate&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently someone saying he didn't have a valid one which you think would've been checked BEFORE he started his campaign. I have heard another spin on this where after his birth he moved out of the country and is suc h no longer a citizen. I don't know how that works, I would guess like here where if you don't live in a place a certain amount of time you can't claim to be from there.

Next is a comment on the Rolling stone article &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/28816321/inside_the_great_american_bubble_machine&quot;&gt;Inside the great American bubble Machine&lt;/A&gt;. Basically my point here is to sum, up the oil price bubble in 30 seconds which the article states is the attention span of the government officials, hence why they never seem to understand problems. I think I do pretty well in boiling it down to the simple points, though I think it take a minute :/.

Last point comes from a post on the Live Journal community &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.livejournal.com/wow_ladies/10801904.html&quot;&gt;WoW Ladies (my wife got me into it)&lt;/A&gt;. The post was about someone wondering about online friends vs real life friends and what people thought of it. I know for me I've had a lot of online friends, far more than real life. there is one serious setback though, if they disappear, you may never know why and depending on  the relationship that can be hard. 

I have posted a similar conversation on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccs-gametech.com/index.php/colaccs-forums?task=viewtopic&amp;id=3808&quot;&gt;City of Lost Angels&lt;/a&gt; forum as well wondering about this, and also a topic on if &lt;a href=&quot;http://ccs-gametech.com/index.php/colaccs-forums?task=viewtopic&amp;id=3814&quot;&gt;people have ever used an avatar based on them&lt;/a&gt;, which I have as Rendal Meriman when I used to DJ, even down to making a Joe Internet shirt.

That's it for the week, have fun.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings June 30, 2009 (Death, WoW Nerfing and Wresting managers)</title>
      <description>OK three topics for today and I apologize for the interruptions, nothing I can do about it sadly =/

First off is the quartet of deaths: Michael Jackson, Farrah Fawcet, Ed McMahon &amp; Billy Mays. I talked about Michael in the Rendal's Thoughts but readdress it here. I find I have the same reaction to all four, indifference. I'm in no way discounting them but it seems I can't really bring myself to feel anything in the deaths. Maybe it just comes with getting older.

Next up is World of Warcraft. Talking to a roommate I found out they are planing to nerf Death Knights. While it doesn't surprise me it does bug me because every time I hear that I remember all the stupid things they have done. I give a couple examples and one solution maybe being instead of nerfing drop them down  a level. You have three levels of mob in the game: normal, silver elite &amp; gold elite. most nerf are mobs going from gold elite to normal which makes a lot of the things that were challenges let downs. so instead drop them to silver. The problem, whiners. People want everything done and easy and they won't play unless it is. So you either dumb it down for them or go out of business.

Last up is managers in wrestling. Being a &quot;old timer&quot; fan I miss seeing managers around. While people can argue that now the WWE/TNA(not sure on that one) now handle the flights and lodging they aren't needed, they have sorely missed the point. None of the managers who we loved we ever popular for what they do outside the ring, it was what we saw them down on TV or in the arenas. So they do so much anymore, that's fine you don't have to pay them as much. You can't deny there is still a strong need for them.

My case in this is Umaga. great athlete for his size. Problem is his character doesn't talk. So apart from seeing him in the ring what motivation is  there to really get into his character? Enter Armando Alejandro Estrada. He spoke for Umaga and got him over threatening to unleash him on people. Playing a role which was basically Harvey Wippleman and Kimchee combined he got the crowd into either Umaga or against him (&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeX9HddZCuc&quot;&gt;see the Jackass confrontation&lt;/a&gt;).

So I've got a suggestion to anyone who wants it, though I target James E. Cornette because he is the one I still hear about. Start up a manger camp. If behind the scenes is taken care of well all well and good but you aren't remembered by the fans as great if your big accomplishment is getting your guys to work on time. They judge by what they see and hear. I think managers still have a place in wresting, they need someone to show them how its done though thanks to the lapse in time we have had without them on screen. 

That's it for me, see ya next week hopefully.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Thoughts: Reaction to Michael Jackson's Death</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1950955.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is about the hot topic of the Day Michael Jackson's death. I must say even growing up in the 80's and being strongly addicted to music I found myself surprised that I didn't feel anything at the news. 

I talk a bit about him then tie him into another, still living, 80's icon Hulk Hogan saying I probably won't feel much for him either. This is no slap at the two's accomplishment, its just that when I think about it I don't get any reaction.

Using wrestling I talk about some deaths that have and will affect me in some way, related mainly to strong memories, the one that even gets me now is seeing Rowdy Roddy Piper's reaction when he won the Intercontinental Championship (see the match &lt;A href=&quot;http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=7435175&quot;&gt;here&lt;/A&gt;).

Feelings are tricky things, I don't know if there ever would've been a time Michael's death would've affected me, I'll still always love his song Thriller though and am thankful he made it.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings June 16, 2009 (updates and Hellboy II)</title>
      <description>Well the summer is here so the kidlet is out of school. I'm trying to find a way to do the show in my room so it won't be an issue if he is up and at home.

Second Life Update:I've quit being the coordinator for the City of Lost Angels Supernatural Clan. I had a chat with Suzanna Soyinka and She Juniper and decided if I stayed it would break the Clan up so I left hoping that they will succeed. I don't know what I'll do now on there, especially since it seems I've been evicted from my home. I'm sure I'll end up somewhere, though I doubt I'll get that involved ever again.

Last up is talking about Hellboy II. I just saw it the other night and love it. I would post a scene from it but ever version online is cut wrong so I'll just recommend renting it and when they get to the locker room, don't drink.

That's it for this week, to see the amusing Bozo Criminal Report go &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.electricferret.com/bozo/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and search for incompetence award.</description>

A lot of stuff is going on today so I just bring you all up to speed on whats going on here at the apartment. I would've done more maybe but I'm waiting on three phone calls :P

One thing I will mention  that I talk about. The person who lives next to the apartment complex recently installed a camera under the belief the kids were harassing his dogs. While that's fine I have to wonder what took him so long? In the ten years living here I've seen the kids throwing rocks that break windows and windshields, deliberately messing with the sprinklers and other things. Sorry but if I had been him it wouldn't be one camera now, it would've been all down the fence years ago.

Of course there is more to it but that's on the podcast.

In the ten years living here I've seen the kids throwing rocks that break windows and windshields, deliberately messing with the sprinklers and other things. Sorry but if I had been him it wouldn't be one camera now, it would've been all down the fence years ago.

Of course there is more to it but that's on the podcast.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings May 26, 2009 (Suicidal Korean Man pushed off bridge, Batman the Animated Series)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1857904.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today's story comes from Korea. A man standing on a bridge contemplating suicide was given a helping hand.

Quoted from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chinasmack.com/more/suicide-jumper-pushed-off-bridge-by-old-man-passing-by/&quot;&gt;This article on the incident&lt;/A&gt;: Chen Fuchao wanted to kill himself because he was in 2 million yuan of debt following a failed construction project.

After knowing the situation, Lai Jiansheng volunteered to talk with the Chen to persuade him. After denied by the police, he broken through a police cordon and climbed up to where Chen sat.

Lai first greeted Chen with a handshake, and then he pushed him off the bridge. Chen fell 8 meters onto a partially-inflated emergency air cushion, damaging his spine and elbow in the fall. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPRM1BfxKL0&quot;&gt;Video here&lt;/a&gt; and I can see the problem, looking at it the catch apparatus was full but it wasn't in position yet, though from the angle above it could've looked safe.)

Now at first I got a kick out of this because honestly there are times when you hear abut someone threatening it to a crowd (Chen did for five hours) and just standing there. Now I know me personally I would love to do to them what Lai did because that's just whining &quot;Oh pity me life has shit on me and it stinks.&quot; Well yeah and everyone else, though they push that inconvenience out of their mind. 

&#8220;I pushed him off because jumpers like Chen are very selfish. Their action violates a lot of public interest,&#8221; Lai said.

I agree. I'm not talking about people who do commit suicide, but those like Chen who start then find the attention it brings. At that point the threat is almost always just for show. 

A quote from &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSTRE54O3BW20090525&quot;&gt;this Reuters article on it&lt;/A&gt; Gives me another reason to support Lai in what he did.

Chen was at least the twelfth person since early April to threaten suicide at the same spot, the Haizhu bridge in Guangzhou. But none jumped and -- until Lian gave Chen a helping hand -- none was pushed.

12 people, in 7 weeks. Sorry but whatever his true intentions were hearing that it makes it look like this spot now is the &quot;Hey look at me&quot; point to go to when things get bad.

Don't get me wrong, I feel for Chen. That much money in a country like that pretty much ruins your life. It would make sense if it were me to end it all since getting out of it looks impossible. And yeah maybe after a while Chen would've come down on his own. But you know he had some little part, or not so little maybe, of him that just wanted to be the star. Why else would he choose that spot?

&quot;Chen is currently recovering in a hospital; the fees are estimated to be very costly.&quot;

Well, he's alive, and who knows maybe this will give him a wake up call and in a few years we'll be hearing how this event shocked him into realizing that while its bad it can get worse so you just have to go with it. I hope so.

After the break I talk about a TV show that I think is just one of the best ever made, Batman the Animated series. Knowing a lot of you may think otherwise I give a list of episodes to back my case, all available for around two dollars on iTunes.

The man who killed Batman
Showdown
Almost Got 'im

Then I talk about what I think is one of the best tragic figures ever, Mr. Freeze. Episodes &amp; movie below.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings May 19, 2009 (Isn't World War 2 Over?)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1840114.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK this one will get some bad reaction I'm sure and that's fine, you take the good with the bad.

It all starts off with me shaking my head at a story on &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090512/ap_on_re_eu/eu_demjanjuk&quot;&gt;John Demjanjuk&lt;/a&gt;, a retired auto worker from Ohio who was a Nazi guard at the Sobibor Camp. What sets me off is this statement from camp survivor Samuel Lerer, &quot;My sense of justice is that he go on trial&quot;.

For what, being a guard? No of course not he was an awful Nazi, we all know that they killed priests and ate babies right? It just gets to me that we have something left over from that time that didn't even last the Cold War where you could point and say Communist, apparently you can still point and say Nazi.

So here is what my sense of justice calls for. I want a Guantanamo person to do the same. I want America's feet in the fire so we can stop pretending we are any better than anyone else. Yeah it got a lot of press but has anyone tried to bring war crimes up against us?

And lets not forget, he was a guard. OK...and? He's a guard. Is everyone honestly supposed to believe that just because he was there he did anything? Maybe he just guarded and protected the camp, isn't that what they're supposed to do?

I find it sick that at 81 with him being in a wheelchair and needing help to breathe that people still have to throw their little fits. Yes he was a Nazi. Yes the group did some terrible things. Yes the war is over and they lost. Now repeat that line over with me kids. THE WAR IS OVER. 

Let the man die so hopefully the war can finally go with him.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings May 12, 2009  (CoLA, Interviews and spiders?)</title>
      <description>Start off by apologizing for coughing in the show as I have caught the bug going around. I do hop on (collective groan) the CoLA topic for a few but just bear with me. There is a reason for it because this time me being sick/gone from SL is different as I finally have someone running the Clan while I'm gone.

First up is something I found gets snickers when I mention it. I get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rollingstone.com/&quot;&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/a&gt; and used to get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.playboy.com/interviews/&quot;&gt;Playboy&lt;/a&gt; and for both I have and still read for the interviews. Yeah there can be some wink wink nudge nudge with people but I'm honest. 

Playboy has interviews that are great to read because you get the feel that people being interviewed feel a little less restrained. Playboy is an adult magazine after all so some things they can't say in other things they can there.

Rolling Stone, even with its popularity has the underground reputation which is helpful. Not quite as unrestrained as adult given it is a public magazine, but much more open than most.

I couldn't find a direct link to Rolling stone interviews but the Playboy link is set right to them.

After the break I talk about spiders, specifically how I got my case of arachnophobia, and crazily how happy I felt when after 5 months or so of hiding mine finally came out and is active again.

      <description>&lt;A href=&quot;http://2-gryphon.livejournal.com&quot;&gt;2, the Ranting Gryphon&lt;/a&gt; posted an article on Live Journal today which has gotten me thinking. That article, &lt;A href=&quot;http://2-gryphon.livejournal.com/210247.html&quot;&gt;Who are you?&lt;/a&gt; is a response from him to people who keep asking how the best way to tell someone how thy truly are is. The article is quite interesting as it looks at a why we feel we have to identify ourselves with one aspect of our being.

It got me to thinking of a You Tube use I like named &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/urgelt&quot;&gt;Urgelt&lt;/a&gt; who made  video called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld1azzZrfGQ&quot;&gt;What is a human being?&lt;/A&gt;. Instead of taking a social or spiritual approach he literally goes inside humans reminding us that not only are we more than we seem, it isn't just one thing that makes us operate.

After the break I talk about gay marriage and about a you tube video I heard about. I also wonder why gay marriage activists insist on using the line &quot;Well if your going to allow gay couples than you need to allow for incest and bestiality too.&quot; Basically their way of saying if you allow for one taboo then why not all of them.I give my thoughts on this and some ideas for people who think like this maybe in the hope one of them will finally be honest and say &quot;I don't want gays getting married because I don't like it.&quot;

I've been thinking about stuff like this a lot lately, the article just showed me I'm not the only one.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings April 21, 2008 (Reminiscing about Second Life)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1765964.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things have been happening lately that really make me feel obsolete in the area I work for in Second Life. It's a dark RP area and while that is all well and good I'm coming to find that I just don't fit anymore. 

I've been working in this position for over two years, and honestly if anyone were to ask what I would have if I walked away I'd have to say nothing. I'm not a builder or scripter so I haven't earned any money on Second Life. While the group I work with I care for it's not something anyone could really understand. It's like an artist being proud of a painting that something in him knows will never be accepted by anyone but him. 


Dark RP isn't all hugs and kittens, I know that. I find in me something though that is having trouble not only accepting it but even listening to people talking about it. I've come to think it being fine for the area, just not my group. Now that it has worked its was in I'm stuck.

I also talk about Opal Island and New Gomorrah, both places that I thought were absolutely beautiful in Second life, both revamped to &quot;fit their surroundings&quot; and as such both lost. I know it will sound silly but the loss of both of those forms really hurt, at what point do you stop conforming and just be yourself?

So yeah just me being an old man still in his 30's.</description>

      <itunes:summary>Things have been happening lately that really make me feel obsolete in the area I work for in Second Life. It's a dark RP area and while that is all well and good I'm coming to find that I just don't fit anymore. 

I've been working in this position for over two years, and honestly if anyone were to ask what I would have if I walked away I'd have to say nothing. I'm not a builder or scripter so I haven't earned any money on Second Life. While the group I work with I care for it's not something anyone could really understand. It's like an artist being proud of a painting that something in him knows will never be accepted by anyone but him. 


Dark RP isn't all hugs and kittens, I know that. I find in me something though that is having trouble not only accepting it but even listening to people talking about it. I've come to think it being fine for the area, just not my group. Now that it has worked its was in I'm stuck.

I also talk about Opal Island and New Gomorrah, both places that I thought were absolutely beautiful in Second life, both revamped to &quot;fit their surroundings&quot; and as such both lost. I know it will sound silly but the loss of both of those forms really hurt, at what point do you stop conforming and just be yourself?

So yeah just me being an old man still in his 30's.</itunes:summary>

      <description>The show is basically a ramble starting with talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYMv7yOJOUM&quot;&gt;this YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/TheAmazingAtheist&quot;&gt;The Amazing Atheist&lt;/a&gt;. The basis being people who not just want to fondly remember the past or past values but want to go back to them.

I go on then talking about people and how they are seen including a couple of focuses on a neat comment I heard on Adolf Hitler, and Tsar Nicholas II after watching Nicholas &amp; Alexandria. 

Then go onto my own little &quot;old man&quot; rant on comics and cartoons stories. Partly on the fact of people discounting them as just kiddie things, mentioning a couple of stories that in both cartoons and comics easily disprove this thought.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings February 23, 2009 (60 Minutes Rundown)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1354575.gif&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Start of by apologizing for the lack of show last week and the meh quality of them. I'm working on it :P

This is basically a full &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/60minutes/main3415.shtml&quot;&gt;60 Minutes Rundown&lt;/a&gt;. 

Starting off we have a really touchy topic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/19/60minutes/main4813571.shtml&quot;&gt;The Drinking Age in America&lt;/a&gt;. The topic of this is the idea of rolling back the drinking age in America from 21 back to 18 on the basis that the law as it stands isn't doing much good.

The law was rolled back apparently in the 70's and as a result there was an increase in drunken driving amoungst young adults (Big surprise :P). in the 80's the age was reset to 21 and not surprisingly the numbers dropped again.

The problem is that now the problem is off the streets and a lot harder to control. This is one sure to cause some debate.

Next up is a story on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/20/60minutes/main4815552.shtml&quot;&gt;The Youngest Nazi&lt;/a&gt;. I honestly don't know what to say except that this is a truly fascinating story. It explains how a man who was born Jewish not only survived the holocaust, but ended up as a Nazi Mascot of all things.

A hostage story concerning CBS producer Richard Butler is last up and I don't know much on what to say about it so here is the link to the story: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/02/20/60minutes/main4815881.shtml&quot;&gt;Hostage Recalls Basra Kidnapping Ordeal&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1581605.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry about this being posted a day late but life has been crazy.

First off is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4784194n&quot;&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; rundown. Nothing much to talk about as a good majority of it deals with U.S Airways Flight 1549 and that's fairly old news. One thing that did irk me though is how people responded to Katie Couric's job in doing the interview. Sorry but if you think you can do better then go get a journalism degree and do it yourself.

Second up was a site I found thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crackle.com/c/Penn_Says#id=2439392&quot;&gt;Penn Says&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://whatstheharm.net/&quot;&gt;What's The Harm?&lt;/a&gt;. Now I found myself for a lot of this just shaking my head wondering how people could do this, I guess this is a form of the Bozo Criminal or Darwin awards.

Last one before my SAM borked (It does help to remember to turn on your mic if you want to talk) was talking about some drug companies &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/2009-02-03-ftc-generic_N.htm&quot;&gt; holding out on releasing cheaper (generic) drugs&lt;/a&gt;. I know I shouldn't be surprised but meh, I guess everyone is allowed to be naive every now and then.

Basically I run down why there was no show last week thanks to the kidlet running off again. This time though he got arrested and so now we have three letters after us that no parent wants to see...CPS or Child Protective Services.

Now while I understand they have to do their job it seems like the ones we talked to are a bit stone faced. They almost seem to be doing this by routine. After a while I'm sure that does happen but it would be nice if they showed some interest. The only time they did was when I mentioned we had a spider. 

Aside from that they have been very rude and I wouldn't wish them on anyone honestly. Do they occasionally do some good? Probably, hell everyone does good sometimes. However, there is nothing saying they can't show a little more interest than a scientist looking through a microscope.

Sole news was a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wivb.com/dpp/news/offbeat/offbeat_kxan_austin_road_signs_warn_of_zombies_200901282181340&quot;&gt;prank pulled that changed a road sign&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 20, 2009-Barack Obama's Inauguration</title>

First up is the first hot topic &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbs2.com/video/?id=90290@kcbs.dayport.com&quot;&gt;Rick Warren's Invocation&lt;/a&gt;. A lot of people were up in arms on this one and for good reason. On the surface he may seem like one of the worst picks Obama could've made. However I have to say that he did good. I think he knew this was not the time to be controversial, and managed to bring a very good message.

Second up is the Inauguration speech by Barack Obama (Watch: &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-zjho9SPgA&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y88a9EpQid8&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;). I won't lie and say I think this is the best Inauguration speech I've heard, and that's only because I don't remember any previous ones. For the first one I have the ability to remember right now and go back to watch whenever I wish this is a good speech to have that available. I hope that things move forward in as good as they seem to be looking.

For those who aren't listening to this on &lt;a href=&quot;http://fbc.jaieproductions.com/index.php&quot;&gt;The FBC&lt;/a&gt; take my rants  today how you will. I'm sure in some senses some can be applied to other groups in some way, for good or ill. My purpose isn't meant to divide but to show if we don't finally get out and stand behind our beliefs then this victory won't be worth winning because we won't make anything of the opportunities this time brings.

      <itunes:summary>Obama's Inauguration is the topic today, partially because its news worth and partially because I know the furry community is as comfortable with the topics of politics as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs.

First up is the first hot topic Rick Warren's Invocation. A lot of people were up in arms on this one and for good reason. On the surface he may seem like one of the worst picks Obama could've made. However I have to say that he did good. I think he knew this was not the time to be controversial, and managed to bring a very good message.

Second up is the Inauguration speech by Barack Obama (Watch: Part 1 and Part 2). I won't lie and say I think this is the best Inauguration speech I've heard, and that's only because I don't remember any previous ones. For the first one I have the ability to remember right now and go back to watch whenever I wish this is a good speech to have that available. I hope that things move forward in as good as they seem to be looking.

For those who aren't listening to this on The FBC take my rants  today how you will. I'm sure in some senses some can be applied to other groups in some way, for good or ill.

Next is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/60minutes/&quot;&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; Rundown. First up is the feature on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/17/broadcasts/main4188620.shtml&quot;&gt;Oil Features&lt;/a&gt; which show that the the past price spike the oil industry had little or no say on the price per barrel thanks to oil commodities pandered on Wall Street. Next up is an interview with the Joint Chief's Chairman &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/08/60minutes/main4707798.shtml&quot;&gt;Mike Mullen&lt;/a&gt; about how the Obama administration plans on handling the Middle East conflict with Iraq and the mainly forgotten Afghanistan. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/08/60minutes/main4707723.shtml&quot;&gt;Wyclef Jean&lt;/a&gt; is next and again a very positive celebrity story talking about his work to improve his home country of Haiti. Its nice to see encouraging stories with celebrities at times like this. And of course &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/08/60minutes/rooney/main4707740.shtml&quot;&gt;Andy Rooney&lt;/a&gt;, this time discussing his favorite holiday.

OK First story is about &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090107/ap_on_re_us/unemployment_glitches&quot;&gt;Unempolyment Claims crashing networks&lt;/a&gt;. Yes the economy is hit to the point that the computer networks can process things fast enough to keep up. this is a mixed thing because while it means more jobs are being cut it also means that there will be plenty of able people to take up job programs should the government choose to go that route.

Speaking of getting fired, in addition to loosing its balls on standing up for its wrestlers (IE Muhammad Hassan and Chris Benoit), now the World Wrestling Entertainment apparent has developed a fear of the phrase &quot;Fired&quot;, instead using the stupidest phrase yet I've heard...&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/wwe/230.html&quot;&gt;&quot;Efficiences&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Are they that sad that they can't even use a simple phrase? No wonder Trump kicked McMahon's keister, He at least has no fear of the English language.

Finishing up jobs, Australia may have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090113/od_afp/lifestyleaustraliatourismoffbeat_20090113032028&quot;&gt;Best Job in the World&lt;/a&gt;, being a caretaker of Hamilton Island. Anyone in the world can apply, and while I like being warm I think I would melt down there :)

Top story for the past week is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090109/ap_on_re_us/illinois_governor&quot;&gt;Impeachment of Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt; by a vote of 114-1 with one declaring present. 114-1-1. OUCH. Sorry but it doesn't get much more final than that. All I have to say is good lock Rod, you'll need it.

In some fun news a lady has found what seems to be one of, if not the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Woman-finds-139-year-old-baseball-card-in-box-of?urn=mlb,132871&quot;&gt;Baseball Cards&lt;/a&gt; of the Red Stocking B.B. Club of Cincinnati. It sounds like they were baseball's equivalent of the early days of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.harlemglobetrotters.com&quot;&gt;Harlem Globetrotters&lt;/a&gt; who used to just crush other teams until they started adding tricks to their routine. 

Last up, we know what the Seven wonders of the World were, and What the current seven man made wonders are now its time for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090106/ap_on_sc/eu7_natural_wonders&quot;&gt;Seven Natural Wonders&lt;/a&gt;. Yup someone is trying to cement the seven places in the world that can be considered &quot;wonders&quot;. I expect a lot of quiet dissension on this one, especially well well known places start getting eliminated.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 6, 1008 (60 Minutes, Alcohol and Government)</title>

Anyway we start off talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2009/01/05/world/international-us-iraq-usa-embassy.html&quot;&gt;New American Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in Iraq which if it hasn't at least been attempted bombed in two months, someone isn't doing their job. It looks like a prison and cost 592 Million dollars?! does this mean we can start fixing the country up now that this monstrosity is up?

Next up is the &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/60minutes/&quot;&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; Rundown. The first part I talk about is the story relating to a new use of MRI's for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/31/60minutes/main4694713.shtml&quot;&gt;&quot;Mind Reading&quot;&lt;/a&gt;. Its quite an interesting segment. They have a ways to go but it is still quite amazing that we're talking about it at all.

Next up is Alcohol. The first part comes from the other 60 Minutes segment I cover and that's on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/12/31/60minutes/main4694666.shtml&quot;&gt;Drunk Driving&lt;/A&gt;. I'm sorry but I have little sympathy for someone who drives while drunk. That is reckless. The story tells it better than I can so of too...

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/06/business/06smoke.html?_r=1&amp;ref=us&quot;&gt;Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;. Now granted I've never lived with someone who hasn't smoked so maybe I'm biased but why is it people constantly go after smokers. &lt;insert whiny voice&gt;Oh but they stink and I shouldn't have to be forced to breathe that smoke&lt;/end whiny voice&gt;. And I agree, but that doesn't mean you practically shun it. Just certify place to be places where people can smoke. You have to have a Liquor license so why not a smoking one? I know a LOT of bars who would get one if they could.

After the break and winding it down now. Talking briefly about the race for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0109/17029.html&quot;&gt;Republican Chair&lt;/a&gt;. 

Last up is talking about &lt;a href=&quot;http://wonkroom.thinkprogress.org/2009/01/05/club-tax-cuts/&quot;&gt;Tax Cuts&lt;/a&gt;. As expected some people are still pushing for tax cuts for the rich. I hope Obama and the new administration chuck it in the bin and file it in the &quot;utter failure&quot; category.

I also mention a funny comic I found done by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhjunior.com/&quot;&gt;R.H. Junior&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhjunior.com/TH/&quot;&gt;Tally Ho&lt;/a&gt;. The link to the comic itself is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhjunior.com/TH/Images/00128.gif&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;.

First things I talk about are &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081220/ap_on_re_us/gay_marriage_lawsuits&quot;&gt;Proposition 8&lt;/A&gt; and how now people are trying to get the marriages that occurred at the time annulled. Basically this is a &quot;what the fuck is up with you whackoffs?&quot; rant. I compare the gay rights to black civil rights since some people lately have made that comparison as well and wonder how they can do that when slavery was pretty open and homosexual hate has always been pretty quiet.

Second up after the break is talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081230/ap_on_re_us/santa_shooting&quot;&gt;Killer Santa (COVINA, Calif)&lt;/a&gt; and end up talking about how it might be a good time to start teaching Santa as an ideal instead of a actual person to kids. this ends up bleeding into philosophy talk and mentioning a you tube video I'd done on &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_j7L7nH5L4&amp;feature=channel_page&quot;&gt;Reincarnation and Parallel Worlds&lt;/a&gt; (hey I ramble so going from Santa to reincarnation is possible).

After playing Weird Al in honor of Bruce Pardo our killer Santa I finish up on the story of a lady, Michelle Duggar, who has just had her  &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/18th_baby&quot;&gt;18th Child&lt;/a&gt; and is looking to have more! Call me crazy but when your kids can form their own sports team, I think its time to stop.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings December 16, 2008 (60 Minute Rundown &amp; The Condemned)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1472047.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4668132n&quot;&gt;60 Minute Meltdown&lt;/a&gt; is the top of the discussion, and this episode is definitely recommended. 

It starts out with a &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4668109n&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.house.gov/frank/&quot;&gt;Rep. Barney Frank (D.-Mass.)&lt;/a&gt; which I found very fun to watch as he is quite open and honest about his views. 

The second is one that I found quite scary on the &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4668112n&quot;&gt;Mortgage Meltdown&lt;/a&gt; and that it should be watched carefully as there is much more coming and weather or not you own the home your in you still could be affected.

Last up on the rundown is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4667942n&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/A&gt; on &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.petecarroll.com/&quot;&gt;Pete Carroll&lt;/a&gt; which is a neat view of a sports figure and behind the scenes.

Then I review &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/stonecold/&quot;&gt;Steve Austin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443473/&quot;&gt;The Condemned&lt;/a&gt; (which stars &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2488008/&quot;&gt;Emelia Burns&lt;/A&gt;, not &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0365140/&quot;&gt;Naomie Harris&lt;/A&gt; who played Calypso).

The show &quot;ends&quot; (my SAM messed up) talking more of the fiasco surrounding Illinois Governor &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Blagojevich&quot;&gt;Rod Blagojevich&lt;/a&gt; and me admitting that even reading about him makes me uncomfortable as it seem to go against a lot of what I thought of America.

      <itunes:summary>The 60 Minute Meltdown is the top of the discussion, and this episode is definitely recommended. 

It starts out with a profile on Rep. Barney Frank (D.-Mass.) which I found very fun to watch as he is quite open and honest about his views. 

The second is one that I found quite scary on the Mortgage Meltdown and that it should be watched carefully as there is much more coming and weather or not you own the home your in you still could be affected.

Last up on the rundown is a profile on Pete Carroll which is a neat view of a sports figure and behind the scenes.

Then I review Steve Austin's The Condemned (which stars Emelia Burns, not Naomie Harris who played Calypso).

The show &quot;ends&quot; (my SAM messed up) talking more of the fiasco surrounding Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and me admitting that even reading about him makes me uncomfortable as it seem to go against a lot of what I thought of America.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings-December 2, 2008 (Lotta Stuff)</title>
      <description>The show starts off with a &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/60minutes/main3415.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/a&gt; Rundown, talking a bit about the Michael Phelps and Monica Brown before getting a mini rant in about online gambling

The first topic is one that is just kind of there, that being the &lt;A href=&quot;Shooting-http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081129/ap_on_re_as/as_india_shooting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;India Shooting Spree&lt;/a&gt;. I'm not trying to discount this story a all, but somethings are just damn hard to put into words. That is a common thread with this show :/

Second up is another one, &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081129/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/soldier_stress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Soldier stress&lt;/a&gt;. This is an article about the military making preparations to deal with large amounts of cases involving Post traumatic stress disorder. I guess they decided to stop blaming the solders for this one.


&lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081129/ap_on_go_su_co/scotus_stevens&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Justice Stevens&lt;/A&gt; is next. I'm really picking crap this week :P. most of these I have no clue how to approach.

It gets a little better with a story on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081129/ap_on_re/obit_docherty&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Pastor who helped get under god in the Pledge of Allegiance&lt;/A&gt;. I can see some of this though it still is a weird issue for me. My advice change God to &quot;God&quot;.

Coming back from the break I talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081129/ap_on_bi_ge/ml_opec_meeting&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OPEC Meeting&lt;/A&gt;.The price of oil is quite a topic here as Norvak works for a company who is dependent on that industry, making parts for the various tools they use in getting oil. So this one is a problem as oil is down under $50 a barrel and his boss warned him things might get tight if it dropped below $60.

Last up is a mention of an article I added just for the hell of it on &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081129/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/infant_formula&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Infant Formula&lt;/a&gt;, but I can't remember why I added it. So I finish up talking about a couple of history Channel shows, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.history.com/minisites/einstein&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Einstein&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.history.com/minisites/universe&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Universe&lt;/A&gt;. Incidentally the Asian guy I found out is &lt;A href=&quot;mkaku.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michio Kaku&lt;/A&gt;.</description>

      <title>Raving Rendal-OK Vince McMahon here is an idea.</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1405106.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh my god, I posted and it isn't Tuesday? Yes it took a while but I finally found something to talk about, in this instance the WWE (world wrestling Entertainment) and an idea from a lowly TV watcher.

For those of you not in the know, the WWE has hired &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005327/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freddie Prinze Jr.&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to help wrestlers learn how to act. As confusing as that is just role with it.

I was browsing You Tube last night and came across this match involving &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFQvOazOA8w&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Truth Commission&lt;/a&gt;. It got me to thinking, which is dangerous but hey, and this is what I came up with.

The Commandant, the first manager of the Truth Commission, was South African actor &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0809770/&quot;&gt;Robin B Smith&lt;/A&gt;. He still is acting and still looks in excellent shape. His whole idea was America is weak and he is here with his men to Show us how to be strong again.

So lets go to the present. Here is what I would do if I could.

JBL, the Wrestling God, looks at the state of the WWE and is disgusted. The &quot;sports Entertainment&quot; he feels has cheapened his Godhood. With this is mind he goes out looking for someone to help him return wrestling to its former glory. He looks around talking to past managers looking for someone to help him with the idea he will bankroll it. Most obvious one would be Ted Dibiase Sr. though maybe check some others as well.

Finally he says he found his man and brings out the Commandant. The Commandant says this time he is going to prove his case by instead of bringing in his men, taking existing people and bringing them into his fold. Another thing you could do is bring in Kurrgan, strictly as the muscle behind the Commandant.

So through trial and error the new Truth Commission is born and you also had the advantage of having an actor who also has pre existing knowledge of the product, having worked with it for a while in both WWE and the USWA.

This is just my idea and if I could I'd pitch it to WWE myself. This will have to do though, so here you go Vince, I know its not much but hey, you would have a stable again, a strong managing team in JBL and the Commandant and give the people a storyline that could run for a long time and be able to change players without getting old or unbelieveable.</description>

Now don't get wrong I didn't even bother taking the test because I know all I'd be doing is adding a one to the long line of dumb shits, but it does worry me that we don't seem to have enough national pride to learn about our own history anymore. Well its either that or the corporations running America now just doesn't want people reminded that they weren't always in charge.

Next on the line of stupidity we have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081122/ap_on_re_us/fort_campbell_fire&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Stupid Arson Wife&lt;/A&gt;. Our brain dead heroine decided the best way to get rid of her husband and collect his life insurance was to burn down where they live. Of course he got out and she ended up killing two of her kids. Next time might I recommend something a LITTLE less likely to go awry...like...oh maybe a knife or a gun?

Now the stupid gets really weird as we look in on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081122/ap_on_re_us/webcam_suicide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Online suicide&lt;/A&gt;. Say what you will about the person killing themselves in front of an audience, but what the hell does it say about us as a species when we just sit back and watch it like any other TV program?

Last one before the break, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=sandwich+making+patent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;McDonald's Sandwich making Patent&lt;/A&gt; (which I learned of reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubersoft.net/files/comics/hd/hd20081125.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ubersoft&lt;/A&gt;). I really am not sure how to take this, especially when looking this up I've found this isn't &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sealed_crustless_sandwich&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the first time&lt;/a&gt; this would be patented.

Back after the break and now discuss Politics, specifically an article on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081123/ap_on_bi_ge/lt_apec_summit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;APEC summit&lt;/a&gt;. Is it just me or is the Bush group doing everything possible to reverse everything
they spent eight years doing, or at least those things that
will help the American sheep think just a little more highly
of them.

And last up is the topic of Immigration, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4628657n&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Deporting Widows&lt;/A&gt;. For those of you who haven't been following this, our brave government has taken
the war on terror to that hotbed of...widows? yup, saying that they didn't go through the proper steps to get their citizenship they now are almost foaming at the mouth to deport these people. Why? I don't have the foggiest notion, and I strongly suspect neither do they.

I wander a bit today starting out talking about the economy, talking about making it look like a governmental land grab.

then I shift to a dream I had some time ago dealing with Madison Lake, MN (and giving a shout out to Jerry Groebner), and talking about some of my life while living there. I also mention Montevideo, MN and a quick mention of a dream involved with that city as well.

I end with giving praise to the webcomic &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.flipsidecomics.com/&quot;&gt;Flipside&lt;/A&gt; as well as erotic fan fiction author &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asstr.org/files/Authors/Dimitri/&quot;&gt;Dimitri&lt;/a&gt; for both giving me much more from erotic stories than I could've hoped, a plot that overshadowed the eroticism.</description>

I didn't think Americans had it in them to speak with one voice anymore but you did and it made me proud to be an American again.

What am I talking about? The defeat of the 700 Billion dollar bailout bill. Yes yes the Democrats and Republicans can blame each other all they want but it was calls and e-mails from you that woke the house up to the facts that:

A. We don't want this.

B. This is an election year and only little more than a month away from voting, so pay attention if your up for re-election!

I discuss a couple other things as well like the You Tube Oct.1 videos (re: Marshall Law) and even how I got really into politics due to 9/11, but the main point of this is the economy, my thoughts on it and my thanks to you all for standing up for yourselves. Bravo America...now Keep it up!

      <title>Rendal's Ravings September 2, 2008 (Video game addiction, Gustav and other bits)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1190368.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK a couple of topics today, this is also a rare recorded show instead of live becaus someone asked me to DJ in second Life and with it starting at 11am there is no way it will be done by noon when I would normally do a show.

OK first topic is &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/gustav_evacuees&quot;&gt;Gustav and the feeling of New Orleans evacuees&lt;/A&gt;. I talk about about the article though most of my attention is on some scum who robbed a church voulenteer's home and killed one dog while blinding the other. Honestly is it so hard to see why some people want to hide their affiliation with the human race after shit like this?

Second up is an article on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/06/08/craft_addicts/&quot;&gt;Psychologically treating video game addicts&lt;/A&gt;. It is an interesting topic and I get into this one a bit being a long time addict myself starting WAY back with ATARI 2600 and now up to World of Warcraft.

I also plug a new Podcast someone let me onto called &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.fanoff.com/shows/rinse/&quot;&gt;Rinse/Repeat&lt;/a&gt;. If you have ever listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fanoff.com/shows/artar/&quot;&gt;Anime Round Table and Review&lt;/a&gt; then you will probably recognize the ladies in it Theresa and Rachel. It is wodnerfully fun to listen to and I recommend it highly, especially since it is just starting up :)

The last thing I touch on is something in &lt;a href=&quot;http://readersdigest.com&quot;&gt;Reader's Digest&lt;/a&gt;. They periodically print bits of books and this month have posted a bit on a book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://readersdigest.com/diamonds&quot;&gt;The Necklace by Cheryl Jarvis&lt;/A&gt;. I highly recommend reading this as it is a very fun thing to read over. As soon as I can I'll be buying the book :)

Thats it for today, next week should be live again.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings August 26, 2008 (Second life Kidapper and Barack Obama the feel good candidate?)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1177854.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start off by talking about Second Life. It is in the news again and of course it can't be positive news. The latest bad press is on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesreporter.com/world/x81488526/Woman-charged-in-Second-Life-kidnapping-plot&quot;&gt;a 33 year old lady who went to kidnap an ex virtual boyfriend who is 52&lt;/a&gt;. Apparently dating in your own generation isn't cool anymore and now you have to date your parent's generation. Why can't these people just sleep with their folks and get it out of their system? At least then the craziness would be under one roof. 

In all seriousness this is a growing problem and it shouldn't be surprising honestly. The more popular online chat and dating becomes, the more you are going to run into stories like this. I feel sorry for the guy and the one victim who this article doesn't mention. the lady brought a dog with her and ended up tieing it up with duct tape to keep it quiet thinking the dog might alert the man. 

The second topic is Barack Obama. It is worrying me that lately McCain seems to be getting ahead of Obama in the polls. Is Barack a feel good candidate. Like wrestling does he only have star power while he is chasing the title? Some can capture the ring, others are at their best TRYING to capture it. Time will tell which one Barack Obama ends up being.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings August 12, 2008 (Bernie Mac/Issac Hayes, Dark Humor and Reader's Digest)</title>
      <description>OK I start off today talking about school starting up again. The thing that confuses me about it is that it starts before Labor Day, which never happened when I was in school. I also chuckle about how when a Pizza Hut opened in Montevideo, MN we opened twice, once the day before thanksgiving and once the day after.

I divert a bit and talk about a game on MySpace called Heroes, that I literally just found out about before the show. My character on there is called Rendal and is a Paladin. I don't know how to search for a character so you'll have to figure that one out for yourself :P 

Next up I mention the death's of both Bernie Mac and Issac Hayes, who died a day apart and just finished a movie together called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1111948/&quot;&gt;Soul Men&lt;/a&gt;.This leads me to wondering how well qualified I am to even mention these two men since I know little of either, though the soul Men joke kicks off the topic for today...

Today's topic is Dark humor. I didn't realize how tough this could be for a topic as once I start talking it goes from discussing what Dark humor is to what humor is which is a whole different problem. It ends up more with me wondering how  dark my humor has gotten as I've grown older and worrying that it might get to bad at some point. The topic came up as in idea because the September 2008 Issue of Reader's Digest has an article on it.

Which leads me to the closing topic of Reader's Digest's idea to put a McCain vs Obama article in the &quot;Annual Humor Issue&quot;. It consists of both men answering questions sent in by the readers which is a good idea but could've been used to build around its own issue. Maybe that is just me thinking they missed out on something but you never know.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings August 5, 2008 (Dark Knight, Lonesome Dove and other stuff)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1139987.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dark Knight partial review kicks off the movie as I don't want to spoil it for those who either A. are living under a rock, or B. can't afford/find time to go. I liked it. I think it helped cement the new direction in the franchise and hopefully they will keep Bale (minus the guttural batman voice) for future movies. Typecasting be damned he is good and so are the other regulars.
                
                Now there is one burr in my bonnet on this movie, comparisons. Heath vs Jack vs Cesar, Christian vs Michael vs Val vs George vs Adam...yadda yadda, though I'm surprised the battle of the Alfred's hasn't come up yet between Michael Caine and Michael Gough. 
                
                Still two of the best actors in my mind to play the Joker and the Batman keep getting left out, those being Mark Hamill as the joker and Kevin Conroy as the batman. You didn't know they did those roles? Check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103359/&quot;&gt;The Animated Series&lt;/a&gt; Credits, there are a lot of surprises in it. I ended up chuckling about long time voice actor Frank Welker and then going to a break.
                
                After the break things wound down a bit. I start by talking about an &lt;A href=&quot;http://ulmenreunion.com&quot;&gt;Ulmen Family Reunion&lt;/a&gt; out in Oregon my dad thinks I should goto. While I admit it would be interesting there are many problems. getting there and back, lodgings, money, already having a family I just can't leave...you get the idea. If mom and dad went as well, I could probably find a way to convince myself even on such short notice (its the 15-17 of august with this beign the fifth). We'll see...
                
                then I talk about the new &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018PH3L0?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=catspawsskins-20&quot;&gt;DVD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018RWMNM?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=catspawsskins-20&quot;&gt;Blu Ray&lt;/a&gt; release of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096639/&quot;&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/a&gt; which I consider to be one of the best movies ever made. Again a lot of stars in it and while in some cases that spells doom for a project, this one soared with it.
                
                Last up is what I'm guessing is an urban legend. apparently at the time Kurt Angle was a heel in the WWE, an actual Olympic event used his music and the crowd started chanting &quot;You Suck&quot; in the manner wrestling fans had been doing for a while. I can't find anything on the net mentioning it (though honestly looking up Olympic at this point is rather pointless), but that could mean I just haven't found it.

I don't know how many hits to the head it took for them to think this was a good idea but apparently they did it just to prove they could. Good, now sit down and shut the fuck up.

Second up are &lt;a href=&quot;http://kids.yahoo.com/parents/blog/1001/141--Is+%27The+Dark+Knight%27+for+Kids?&quot;&gt;people who think the Dark Knight is to dark for kids&lt;/A&gt;? OK I realize that comic books are STILL seen as something kids steal flash lights for so they can read them under the covers but come on this is Batman. If they payed any attention to the Batman Begins movie they would've noticed things have taken a darker turn again. But hey why take responsibility when you can just bitch afterward right?</description>

But hey why take responsibility when you can just bitch afterward right?</itunes:summary>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings July 8, 2008 (Disassociated)</title>
      <description>Today marks the first of what will probably be a stretch of shorter shows because I feel I have become to distant from the fandom of late, and a large part of that is thanks to the time I spend in &lt;a href=&quot;http://cityoflostangels.biz/&quot;&gt;City of Lost Angels&lt;/a&gt; on Second Life.
                
                I go on to explain what I do there, the formation of the Supernaturals group, who was in it at the start, who is in it now and the directions we are planning on going in if we can and a call out to the fandom to come on over and help us have fun with it. The link to the sim is here (warning it does load slow, both sim and web page :P):&lt;A href=&quot;http://goaddr.com/f5r&quot;&gt;Lost Angels Sim SLURL&lt;/a&gt;. Look for me on there as Speyeder Farina or Rowan Valentine who is my Co-GM.
                
                The Livejournal entry I talk about that started all of this thinking is &lt;a href=&quot;http://raving-rendal.livejournal.com/92943.html&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/A&gt;. The two Cons here in the state of Washington, that I'm aware of, are &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.allfurfun.com/&quot;&gt;All Fur Fun&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rainfurrest.com/&quot;&gt;RainFurrest&lt;/a&gt; which is the one I talk about at the end of the show.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings July 2, 2008 (Ancient UFO's and Magic Mushrooms)</title>
      <description>OK I start off by apologizing for the show being late. I start off by talking about one of two stories that I heard about on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coasttocoastam.com/&quot;&gt;Coast to Coast AM&lt;/A&gt;. The first one deals with a UFO that was discovered by an archeological dig and is &lt;a href=&quot;http://jointreconstudygroup.blogspot.com/2008/06/ancient-crashed-ufo-claimed-to-be-from.html&quot;&gt;assumed to be between 150-200 million years old&lt;/A&gt;. I talk about his for a bit and the possibility for why they seem to buzz small towns and pick on cows so much capping it off with talking about the only experience I had with them in the mid 80's in Madison Lake, Minnesota.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiIW1MiDmlE&quot;&gt;Played Insane Clown Possse-Dirt Ball&lt;/a&gt;

OK next up is the other story I heard and that is concerning &quot;magic mushrooms&quot;. According to an article in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=long-trip-magic-mushrooms&quot;&gt;Scientific American&lt;/A&gt;, Dr. Roland Griffiths gave several volunteers a dose of psilocybin which is the active ingredient in magic mushrooms. It should be noted I'm talking about this as someone who has never smoked or drank. So when I say I would be curious in trying this sometime I would only out of curiosity.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP-CtPR73S8&quot;&gt;Played Bill Hicks-Shrooms&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://ritual-reality.com/archive/radio_sub_rosa/paxamericana/track_09.mp3&quot;&gt;Played Radio Sub Rosa-Vision of Love w/Bill Hicks (6.8 meg mp3)&lt;/a&gt;

I close out the show by talking about perception and putting forth a bit of a challenge to Mr. Griffiths asking to see what the effects of the mushrooms would be in areas outside a lab. What would the effect be in nature? In the workplace? In a traffic jam? I don't know about you but I would love to see those results. And if he needs a volunteer I'm game to test it while on Second Life.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_1059574.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Starting out by talking about being back on air and go into discussing the death of comedian &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.georgecarlin.com/&quot;&gt;George Carlin&lt;/a&gt;. I came upon him in the 80's and when I graduated found Carlin on Campus. It hurts to think he is gone now. He seemed to me to be one of the few comics who wasn't afraid to be serious while on stage if he had a point he wanted to get across. 

I do go off on KPQ in Wenatchee for not reading &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_dirty_words&quot;&gt;the seven dirty words&lt;/a&gt; on air. In the end I have to worry that maybe we have lost one of the few who had the courage to stand up for our right to use words the way we want to.

After the break I try talking about a movie I saw this weekend called &lt;a href=&quot;http://zeitgeistmovie.com&quot;&gt;Zeitgeist&lt;/a&gt;. It is a conspiracy theory movie but ne I think is pretty well made. It deals with the history of dominating religion, governmental conspiracies and the one world government.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings June 3, 2008 (Net neutrality, Music in hell, Second Life)</title>
      <description>I started off today talking about a response to my video on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNOgmC9yIYI&quot;&gt;Net Neutrality&lt;/a&gt; and have me and Norvak talking about the pros and cons of some points of the issue.
                
                We also somehow get to talking about music and what some layers of hell would be playing. I honestly don't know how that happened, but it gave us a chuckle.
                
                Mentioned the case of &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/6/2/105034/2069/606/527235&quot;&gt;Wisconsin Navy Vet Keith Roberts&lt;/a&gt; as well and how the ramifications of the case are disturbing.
                
                After the music break I try to start talking about Second Life  and how they are preparing their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.massively.com/2008/06/02/peering-inside-pleading-the-fifth/&quot;&gt;5 yeah anniversary&lt;/a&gt; but Stuff comes up at the apartment and basically ruins any ideas I had so I end the show.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings May 27, 2008 (the power of Words)</title>
      <description>OK its time for some bitching about words and their power. The case for class today is the word Nigger *GASP and over dramatic faint*. Yes I take this word for a reason as it seems to be one of the most volitle words left in the English language. It can have several meanings (&quot;Fuck off Nigger (asshole)&quot; or &quot;What's up Nigger(homie/pal/acquaintance/etc)?&quot;) 

The only other word I can think of with this much variation is Fuck. Maybe thats why they are shunned so much is it is to easy to misjudge the meaning?
                                                
I also talk about political Correctness and even symbols and the hold some of them seem to have on us (US Flag and Swastika). 
                                                
In short don't listen if hearing the word Nigger offends you because I say it quite a bit :P

      <title>Rendal's Ravings May 20, 2008 (America, Driders and Role Play)</title>
      <description>OK a couple of odd topics for today. 

The first topic covered is how America has shifted from being a communal nation to one of individuals and the effect it is having on the communities. I mention two Minnesota towns as examples, Mankato and Elysian. 

After the break I talk a bit on how another problem lately with people is the stubbornness to accept new was of looking at things, We want everything to stay set in stone so we no longer have to learn.

Ending the show is talk about Roleplay and how limits in it that some people set directly conflict with the RP they are trying to engage in.

After the break I talk a bit on how another problem lately with people is the stubbornness to accept new was of looking at things, We want everything to stay set in stone so we no longer have to learn.

Ending the show is talk about Roleplay and how limits in it that some people set directly conflict with the RP they are trying to engage in.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings April 22, 2008 (Earth Day)</title>
      <description>OK today is Earth Day so lets talk about Pollution. We have WAY to much junk and at this point conventional means of disposal are a joke. So we need some UN conventional ways. How about dropping stuff in volcanoes or shooting stuff into the sun?

After the break I continue taking about the planet and this time shifting focus to the seasons, specifically Winter. I talk about how it seems like we are loosing something when we go through the &quot;winter months&quot; and no snow shows up. 

And at some point I mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.epilogue.net/cgi/database/art/view.pl?id=83913&quot;&gt;this pic&lt;/a&gt;, which I think is just uber pretty.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings April 15, 2008 (John McCain's Economy and Barack Obama's truth)</title>
      <description>GAH...If it wasn't that politics as a whole didn't make me feel so stupid I wouldn't mind shows like this.

First up we have Senator McCain's brilliant idea to help the economy by taking money out of it? Apparently he thinks what we shoudl do is set up a &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080415/ap_on_el_pr/mccain_economy&quot;&gt;&quot;tax holiday&quot;&lt;/a&gt; on the gas tax during the one time of year that most of the income from this tax is generated, starting in Memorial Day and going until Labor day.

Now while that would be good for families taking road trips the problem is he thinks this will cause a &quot;tricle down&quot; economical push. hmmm..trickle down economics...who thought of that again? AH yes...good old Ronnie.

Second up we have yet more BS from the Democrats. Apparently people are taking issue to the fact Barack Obama did the unthinkable and gave his perception on how people live. I think more what they have issue with is if you look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080413/ap_on_el_pr/obama_clinton&quot;&gt;what he said&lt;/A&gt; it doesn't sound like something a speech writer woudl put in. That is how a lot of politicians get away with being so blunt. They phrase it in a way that you  think &quot;Meh, he is just reading what they wrote for him. Maybe next time he tries this, if he is behind a podium he should look down?

      <title>Rendal's Ravings April 8, 2008 (Uncle Jay, Absolut and Missle shields)</title>
      <description>Ok I JUST squeeked it this week as I ended up Djing in CoLA 10-noon. It was lots of fun with 19 people at one point tuning in and lots of requests. It may end up being something I do everyweek though not on Tuesday &gt;.&gt;

Next up I play the March 17th show of &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.unclejayexplains.com/&quot;&gt;Uncle Jay Explains&lt;/a&gt;, that deals with hubris. It is quite a fun little videocast and I recommend it to anyone who needs a fun way to start the week as it comes out every Monday.

Next up is the first major topic of the day. This deals with an &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080408/us_nm/mexico_absolut_dc&quot;&gt;Absolut Ad&lt;/a&gt; that ran in Mexico and depicted a historical map from pre-1848 where Mexico had control of a lot of land in what is now the US. What gets me is this was ONLY run in Mexico and people in the U.S. got the thing taken down. Why? Because the people of the U.S. can't stand the fact that this all wasn't laid out for them when the first settlers arrived.

Next up is Russia vs the US, and no this isn't a retro news from the Cold War. Russia is getting pissed that the US is pushing ahead with their &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080408/ts_nm/shield_russia_lavrov_dc&quot;&gt;Missile Shield&lt;/a&gt; located in the Czech Republic and Poland. I can certainly sympathize with them, I know I wouldn't want some idiot to park a missle next door to me, I don't care if he thinks he has a good reason or not. But this is the US so we're just going to do it anyway :P.

This time I talk about a statement Bill Clinton made of someone telling him &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080330/ap_on_el_pr/campaign_rdp&quot;&gt;Don't you dare let her(Hillary) drop out. Don't listen to those people in Washington, they don't represent us.&lt;/a&gt; That statement depresses me because it shows that people seem to just be voting for party now (I'm a democrat/republican so I'm going to vote for X because they are democrat/republican!). That is stupid people. There are MANY better reasons to vote for people. Also talk about the Democrats becoming flustered with the election that seems to go on and on to the point the candidates are saying &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080401/ap_on_el_pr/clinton_primaries&quot;&gt;each wants the other to drop out&lt;/a&gt;.

I also give a rundown of my presidential voting experience and  my thoughts on how the Hillary/Barack race may end up helping them or hurting them where it comes to McCain as the Republicans have long since picked their representative. 

After the break I talk about the &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080330/ap_on_re_us/obit_dith_pran&quot;&gt;&quot;Killing Fields&quot; survivor dying&lt;/a&gt;. I will confess I have not read the story or seen the movie and all I know of this is what is in this article, but I think it is worth talking about as it is from a past we seem to have shut in the closet long ago.

The last bit is talking about one of my favorite artists in &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.toddlockwood.com&quot;&gt;Todd Lockwood&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.multichannel.com/index.asp?layout=blog&amp;blog_id=1300000330&amp;blog_post_id=460022446&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; Todd was commissioned by &lt;A Href=&quot;http://www.upperdeck.com/&quot;&gt;Upper Deck Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, The company who makes the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://clickserve.cc-dt.com/link/tplclick?lid=41000000011185116&amp;pubid=21000000000114749&quot;&gt;World of Warcraft TCG&lt;/a&gt;, to make a special card for the game based on TV host &lt;A href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_colbert&quot;&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/a&gt;. While Todd completed the picture (which can be seen as the graphic for this podcast), Someone on the Colbert side nixed it. The picture was subsequently leaked to the internet and has caught on quickly. Lockwood apparently is covered by the parody law and can sell this at conventions, though not on his website. I hope I can e-mail him and see about getting a copy, I think it is awesome.

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_819998.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This weeks show is short due to me having parent teacher conferences today. I talk about a bill apparently being looked at in the Oklahoma state legislature concerning religious views in school. Basically what I have learned from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edmondsun.com/opinion/local_story_067125346.html&quot;&gt;article in the Edmond Sun&lt;/a&gt; is that This bill, while in addition to allowing student's to push their views on others if they hold any rank in the school by using their speech time to talk about their religion, also would allow them to give answers that are scholastically wrong in a test or class and still receive credit.

The example given is some religions believe the Earth to be 6000 years old, while education believes it to be 4.65 billion. With this law the school would have to accept the 6000 answer or risk being sued.

Look folks, we all have things we don't like to do or subjects we don't want to learn. Sit in the room, give t he answers your taught and keep your individuality for outside the school. The end of days won't come if everyone who believed in the 6000 year old theory puts down 4.65 billion on a test. there are much better fights to be fought, like...oh I don't know...maybe increasing funding in education so that teachers have better resources to do their jobs?

      <title>Rendal's Raving March 18, 2007 (atlanta tornado, Ferraro feedback, BEES, fuel efficient cars)</title>
      <description>OK the first story covered is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/weather/03/17/atlanta.tornado/index.html&quot;&gt;tornado that hit downtown Atlanta&lt;/a&gt;. It surprises me a bit to hear more often how Tornadoes are making it so far into towns like this even thinking that maybe downtown is the new trailer park to them?

Next up is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/12/ferraro.feedback.irpt/index.html&quot;&gt;follow up&lt;/a&gt; to the Geraldine Ferraro I talked about last week. A lot of people have left feedback on this (including one from my mom's hometown Elysian, MN) and i cover some of the things they brought up including how business must be laughing at the affirmative action pickle the media is in having to work with a woman and a black man. Also on Barack Obama channeling Martin luther king (why wouldn't he?) and how the republicans are doing the same with Regan.

I also talk briefly about a fear I had of being compared to others, though I learned while it is often inevitable iot isn't always bad.

Next we have....&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/17/swarming.bees/index.html&quot;&gt;BEEES!&lt;/a&gt; Yes a truck tipped over spilling its load of 400 hives and some 8 million bees out on a highway in Sacremento, CA. I feel sorry for the people behind it.

The closing topic is two cars that get...are you ready..hundreds of miles to the gallon of gas. One in fact gets &lt;A href=&quot;http://green.yahoo.com/blog/ecogeek/361/7-000-mpg-car-wins-eco-marathon.html&quot;&gt;7,148 miles per gallon&lt;/a&gt; while another, that is planning to be out this year gets &lt;a href=&quot;http://auto.howstuffworks.com/aptera-hybrid.htm&quot;&gt;330 miles per gallon&lt;/a&gt;. Wouldn't it be sweet if we could get all cars to those standards?

      <title>Rendal's Ravings March 11, 2008 (Vatican, Water, Stds and Obama)</title>
      <description>Ok start off by apoligizing for not keeping up to date on things when it comes to the archives. Also warn that Rendal's Picks might not be live due to having to goto court.

First off is &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/03/10/vatican.updates.sins.ap/index.html&quot;&gt;New vatican sinful behaviours&lt;/a&gt;. I ramble a bit about this as honestly it was just thrown into the swhow because I found this a bit redundant. So over time we have found new ways to sin, way to keep up with the times Rome.

Next up, &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080309/ap_on_re_us/pharmawater_i&quot;&gt;Drugs in Drinking Water&lt;/A&gt;. While it may be news to some this doesn't shock me as much as WHAT drugs they are finding. Some of these I wouldn't take if they were prescribed and here I am drinking it?

&lt;A href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/conditions/03/11/teen.std.ap/index.html&quot;&gt;1 in 4 teen girls has had a STD&lt;/a&gt;. This surprised me much less when I saw the age range was 14-19. Come on..18 and 19 you are quite experimental so should it be any surprise? I would love to know what those figures are if you went from 14-17. If THAT was still around 25% I would be worried, or even 1 in 6 (18%). Still it is an eye opener for some I'm sure.

The two main topics this week deal with Barack Obama. The first being &lt;a href=&quot;http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/11/obama-adviser-says-clinton-must-repudiate-backers-comments/&quot;&gt;Geraldine Ferraro's comments&lt;/a&gt;. I don't know where this old bag gets off saying that Obama wouldn't have the success if he wasn't black but hey maybe she believes it. The same case could be made with Hillary Clinton being a woman but honestly the reason is simple. Barack and Hillary are riding high because they're DEMOCRAT. The Republicans screwed up big time and now the Democrats are having their day in the sun. So drop the race and gender already.

Last is Obama being number 2. I don't like this idea and why is simple. He can do much more staying in the Senate if he looses the primary because then he will be able to use his charisma to help push Hillary's stuff through. That way he can give the naysayers on his experince the brush off.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings February 26, 2008 (Break, Internet gender and bionics)</title>
      <description>First half of the show was spent catching people up on why there haven't been any live shows in a while (me on vacation and a week where I just was to frazzled to do it). 

Next up is a re-asking of the Question from the February 5 show. What would you play for a child if you knew the song would influence how they grew up. You can name two songs and it doesn't matter what they are. This is what YOU would play, not what is socially acceptable. Email me your choices at rendalsravings@yahoo.com.

Then I discuss a thread in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cityoflostangels.biz&quot;&gt;CoLA&lt;/A&gt; forum (totally off topic section) that dealt with people posting their &lt;a href=&quot;http://cityoflostangels.biz/wiki/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=18&amp;thread_id=2476&quot;&gt;RL pics&lt;/a&gt;. I posted mine as Speyeder and talk about the surprise I got when people didn't freak out that a feminine herm was played by a guy. 

After the break I talk about a story that was on Yahoo this morning in that scientists now are working on developing a bionic contact lens that can zoom in and out, work in night vision, all the stuff straight out of sci-fi. I wonder since we already have &quot;bionic&quot; arms and I believe legs, if we really have much left before we can create en exoskeleton. Someone on the verge of death? No problem, just drop the brain in an exoskeleton.

The obvious problem would be power and how to connect the brain to the power source without frying it. Also how would the five senses be dealt with? Touch and taste could be done with sensors of some kind. Hearing could be done with a microphone in each ear. Sight is already solved with the contact lens. that would leave smell. that I don't know but maybe someone is working on that too?

Thats it for my show today, thanks for dropping by.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings February 5, 2008 (Winter Travel, What would you play, The Revenge of Little Crow)</title>

Remember kiddies if you are dumb like me and think traveling in winter is a push over then don't be surprised when it isn't :P.

Next up I have  question for you all. If you could play one song for a child that would influence them the rest of their life what would you play for them? You can send your ideas to RendalsRavings@yahoo.com or keep an eye &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/mattulmenin&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/A&gt; for a youtube post with the same question.

After that I start off by thinking I'm doomed to talk about politics but my dad comes in and we end up talking for almost an hour on his Civil War historical fiction novel The Revenge of Little Crow. We talk about the history of the Great Sioux Uprising and about the battle of Wood Lake as well as the presidential order that sentanced 38 indians to hanging in Mankato, MN, The biggest mass execution in US history. If you would like to check the book out on Lulu.com you can do so by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/content/386938&quot;&gt;Clicking Here&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lulu.com/sulmen2001&quot;&gt;Clicking Here&lt;/a&gt; to check out steve's other books incluing Toby Ryker and Deadwood Days, the second and third in the series started by Little Crow.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 29, 2008 (Travel and Hypnosis on Second Life?)</title>
      <description>I talk today about my day so far and the fact I'm going on a trip back to Minnesota to visit my folks and that it is a test of sorts to see if I can still enjoy myself in a state I haven't lived in for almost 10 years.

The second half of the show deals with something Inny Colo, who is a friend of mine in the City of Losy Angels on Second Life mentioned to me and that there is now supposedly a thing in SL that hypnotizes you in a way that you literally become your character. You don't change physically but your mind believes what is happening in the game is what is happening to you. 

This can be dangerous in my mind for various reasons. How would your body cope to changes from your biological form. How would it treat being a furry, or having a tail, tentacles, even being a different gender? Wouldn't that cause serious confusion in the body?

And what happens in a combat sim? What if you end up being killed after being pumped full of lead. How would your body react to that? 

It is an insanely interesting idea, but I have to wonder if we're ready for it yet.

You don't change physically but your mind believes what is happening in the game is what is happening to you. 

This can be dangerous in my mind for various reasons. How would your body cope to changes from your biological form. How would it treat being a furry, or having a tail, tentacles, even being a different gender? Wouldn't that cause serious confusion in the body?

And what happens in a combat sim? What if you end up being killed after being pumped full of lead. How would your body react to that? 

It is an insanely interesting idea, but I have to wonder if we're ready for it yet.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 22, 2008</title>
      <description>I start briefly running down the show topics which today is RPG's and the evolution into MMORPG's. I start off first though By mentioning that yesterday (January 21) was Martin Luther King Jr Day and so I take my break early in order to play the I have a Dream speech in full (Just over 16 minutes).

The RPG topic poked its head into my mind when I saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rhjunior.com/GH/Images/00167.gif&quot;&gt;This Webcomic&lt;/A&gt; on RH Junior's &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.rhjunior.com/GH/&quot;&gt;Goblin hollow&lt;/A&gt;. It also helped that RP etiquette as far as response posts go had been brought up on the &lt;A href=http://cityoflostangels.biz/wiki/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=18&amp;thread_id=2252&quot;&gt;CoLA Forum&lt;/a&gt;. So I take some of the points from both and expand on it to what I hope is an interesting show.

I close by mentioning XFire and having fun with it as a messanger and social site.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 8, 2008 (Politics, Nibiru and Sumerian Tablets)</title>
      <description>The first topic I bring up is politics along with a warning that this will probably be a popular topic for me for a while. I go into who I owuld vote for, both republican and Democrat and my thoughts on the politcs.

I finish up politics after the break and go on to talk about youtube and some very interesting videos I've found that are nothing more than text videos that display a translation of Sumerian tablets that date thousands of years before the old testament. 

And thats about it.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 1, 2008 (Resolutions, Mating and The Longest...)</title>
      <description>OK since we are kicking off a new year with this show I figured the obvious topic would be Resolutions. I do say that I can see them doing some good but think often times we set our standards a bit to high for what we can accomplish.

to this end I propose an idea. Anyone wanting to give up something for their resolution instead of starting on the new year wait until &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lent&quot;&gt;Lent&lt;/a&gt;. Lent for those who don't know is the time of year when people try to do without things, so it would seem like a good time to test that resolution. If afterward you don't think you can follow through you can at least have the pride in knowing you did it for a while.

I go off on a tangent talking about a thread on the CoLA forum called &lt;a href=&quot;http://cityoflostangels.biz/wiki/forum/viewthread.php?forum_id=18&amp;thread_id=1910&quot;&gt;If They Mated...&lt;/a&gt; looking at some of the pictures which I grant doesn't come off well on the air but I'm easily distracted.

The ending has me wondering what the longest time at #1 for a song is which has me finding the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English&quot;&gt;the longest word in english&lt;/A&gt; before finding &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.everyhit.co.uk/record.html&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings December 18, 2007 (Bad Weather Drivers, Mitchell Report, Chris Benoit &amp;amp; WWE and the U.S.A.)</title>
      <description>Well it's officially winter here in Washington as we are covered in &lt;a href=&quot;http://wenatcheeworld.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070301/WEBCAM/70301009/1018/WEBCAM&quot;&gt;the white stuff&lt;/a&gt;. So starting off the show I talk about how people in snow, and bad rain, seem to forget how to drive. And when it isn't the other drives messing with you, usually this is the time the traffic lights play their little games.

Next up I talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071215/ap_on_sp_ba_ne/bbo_mitchell_report_public_reaction&quot;&gt;Public reaction to the Mitchell Report&lt;/A&gt;. I don't see what people don't get here as to why the public is so disinterested in the findings. DUH. The public isn't as stupid as you would believe. We know people are doing things stupid. You know what? That's their choice. Let them do it because they will anyway. Just let us tune in and root for our team.

Next up in a similar vein is the continuing &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/2007_/articles/1197853468.php&quot;&gt;Chris Benoit drama&lt;/a&gt; with people STILL trying to figure out how the estate of the wrestler should be distributed based on...get this...who died first?? That and my continung disgust with WWE and the McMAhon's on their cowardly actions toward this whole situation including now The WWE basically dumping the family aside instead of saying &quot;Yeah Chris Made us money, here why don't you have some.&quot; Jackoffs the whole place.

And winding up the Show I talk about the USA and how we deserve the attacks we have been getting including 9/11. Why do I go off? because to me we are hypocrites. I got on this tangent when talking about Benoit brought up Phil Spector and O.J. Simpson and how Simpson's little emo ride ruined a already bad time in my life (My grandma died the same day). Then to how I hate 9/11, not because of the attack on the US, because it came on my parent's 30th wedding anniversary. So yeah lots of ranting here and some out right raving. If you STILL think the US is good then maybe the last couple minutes will get you thinking, I won't hold out hope though.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings December 11, 2007 (World of Warcraft vs Second Life)</title>
      <description>Well today I had no end of crap luck. at 7am with world of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.squidoo.com/wowtcg&quot;&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; still down for weekly maintenance &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.secondlife.com/?u=1b0c61ad279a7f556b2033f5d0ba44b7&quot;&gt;Second Life&lt;/a&gt; went down. this wouldn't have been so bad except Trillian was also on the blink as was mIRC. I went into Furry MUCK and Tapestries a bit but looking at the slow scrolling chat started making me goto sleep.

During all this the CoLA website thought it would join in the fun and went down. I then discovered while none of the messangers worked on Trillian IRC did. and Y! worked as long as I used Yahoo's program...to weird...

At 11am WoW was back and SL...Well not so lucky, now they said noon. And as of the time I started this they said 2pm. SO off I rant...

After said rant, music break and the normal Bozo Criminal and Thought of the day I quickly go over some of the news that caught my eye. Stories like &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20071208/wl_asia_afp/britaincourtwillchina_071207192840&quot;&gt;Chinese restraunt owners winning a court case where their status as a legal benifactor of a will was contested&lt;/A&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071210/ap_on_re_eu/nobel_prizes&quot;&gt;Gore Accepting his Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071211/ap_on_re_us/winter_storm&quot;&gt; The Severe weather&lt;/A&gt;.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings December 4, 2007 (online Relationships, Rendal's Picks and News)</title>
      <description>Todays first topic is relationships, specifically the ones I have found myself in. A couple instances relate to my characters on world of Warcraft Sylvestria and Speyeder, which the other focuses on the Second Life character Speyeder Farina.

I also tell the current take of how Mairia Miranda has managed to inadvertently slide herself into a very fun little storyline and about the story I wrote to help progress the plot involving Mairia and Speyeder.

The second half is announcing &lt;A href=http://rendalspicks.podomatic.com/&quot;&gt;Rendal's Picks&lt;/a&gt; which is going to replace Flash in the Pan fully come next year. I also run down the list of article titles from news I had hoped to discuss including:&lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071204/ap_on_re_eu/sudan_british_teacher&quot;&gt;The British teacher from Sudan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;A href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071203/ap_on_sc/dinosaur_mummy&quot;&gt;A Dinosaur Mummy&lt;/a&gt; and thoughts from &lt;A href=&quot;http://suicidegirls.com/news/culture/22750/&quot;&gt;Warren Ellis:aka The Sunday Hangover&lt;/A&gt;.

The show ends a bit weird as the stream conked out and I had to re record the end but it happens.

      <itunes:summary>Todays first topic is relationships, specifically the ones I have found myself in. A couple instances relate to my characters on world of Warcraft Sylvestria and Speyeder, which the other focuses on the Second Life character Speyeder Farina.

I also tell the current take of how Mairia Miranda has managed to inadvertently slide herself into a very fun little storyline and about the story I wrote to help progress the plot involving Mairia and Speyeder.

The second half is announcing Warren Ellis:aka The Sunday Hangover.

The show ends a bit weird as the stream conked out and I had to re record the end but it happens.

This has gotten some heated debate and &lt;a href=&quot;http://myspace.com/maelynd&quot;&gt;Maelynd&lt;/a&gt;, who is one of those involved in the controversy talks for a while about it with me.

After that its just talking about Warcraft and trying to get people from SL on there to have more fun. I don't want to leave SL, just want someone I am friends with to run with on Warcraft.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings November 20, 2007 (Sesame Street, Family Movies, First Amendment and Myspace Suicide)</title>
      <description>OK I start out by talking about an article in the New York Times about, of all things, Sesame Street. Apparently the first season which inititally aired in 1969 is no longer child friendly and has been labled for adults only. Do anyone else see this as a sign of the end when we don't trust our kids to be smart enough &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/magazine/18wwln-medium-t.html&quot;&gt;not to eat a pipe?&lt;/A&gt;

The second bit is talking about a list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cookiemag.com/entertainment/2007/06/moviepicks?currentPage=1&quot;&gt;25 movies&lt;/a&gt; that families might find fun to watch together. Not a bad list, and I give a couple thoughts on the titles as I read them. I also suggest a couple things that should be on the list, in my opinion of course.

After the break I talk about an article &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-11-19-n52.html&quot;&gt;relating to a lawsuit to find out the identity of a Blogspot Blogger&lt;/a&gt; and how I think some people are misinterpriting how it turned out and how people would be a lot better off if they actually read the terms and conditions of thinsg before they sign up.

Last up...Lets just say I get VERY passionate about this one. It stems from &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071117/ap_on_re_us/internet_suicide&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about the suicide of a girl on MySpace in DARDENNE PRAIRIE, Mo and how the family members of a former friend made a fake ID for the sole purpose of basically fucking with her mind. Not for those easily offended.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings November 13, 2007 (Good vs Bad, Writting, Wenatchee Property Tax and the CoLA vs NoR Battle)</title>
      <description>OK time to jabber once again. I start off by talking about a neat theme in movies I'm becoming more aware of lately in good vs evil with a twist, the twist being that both sides not only accept but admit that the game is only fun when their opponent is involved. I play a clip from &lt;A href=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FFiendish-Plot-Dr-Fu-Manchu%2Fdp%2FB000SVZID0&amp;tag=catspawsskins-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&quot;&gt;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Mandchu&lt;/A&gt; where Fu Manchu not only admits he likes having Nayland as a sparring partner, but gives him some Elixir Vitaie so they can continue thier game.

I then talk about writing a bit and feeling a relief when reading someone in Rolling Stone basically saying &quot;Not everything is going to be eprfect so just give it a try&quot;. That thought along with the above inspired me to write the world of Warcraft Fan fiction &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3883576/1/Reflections&quot;&gt;Reflections&lt;/a&gt;.

After the break I talk a bit about yet another loss for money thanks to the two words &quot;Property Tax&quot;. You know folks, if you don't want the few paying for the ideas of the many thats fine, then give us a better option, and for a lot of this &quot;Don't spend so much&quot; isn't an option.

I close out talking about the ongoing drama in SL between &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.landofnor.com&quot;&gt;Nation of Remembrance (NoR)&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cityoflostangels.biz&quot;&gt;City of Lost Angels (CoLA)&lt;/a&gt;. Maelynd comes in to talk about this a bit as well.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings November 6, 2007 (Ron Paul record, Citigroup &amp;amp; JBL, falling cow, radio cancer therapy and Darth Cheney)</title>
      <description>OK I start out this week apologizing for the lack of current music to the FBC archives aned the inane stupidity of working on Limewire. I guess having 8.2 quadrillion sources for a song no longer means it will be a surefire download.

Next up is talking about one of my favorite Presidential Candidates Ron Paul. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071106/ap_po/paul_fundraising&quot;&gt;set a record&lt;/a&gt; for fundraising pulling in 3.2 Million dollars in donations in 20 hours on Nov. 5th. Quite a accomplishment for someone the mainstream media seems bound and determined to ignore.

We follow with talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=90ec2cc6-24e3-4a3a-8db9-2ddbb47ae902&amp;k=96984&quot;&gt;Citigroup stock downgrade&lt;/a&gt; and how it is crossing news services because the financial analyst is married to a pro wrestler. I do veer off topic a little talking about JBL and some thoughts of him but do wander back.

After the break I read a humorous article on a &lt;A href=&quot;http://wenworld.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071105/NEWS04/711050054&quot;&gt;Cow falling off a cliff onto a car&lt;/a&gt;. then I start into the &quot;Main topic&quot;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/la-na-cancer2nov02,0,4741362.story?page=3&amp;coll=la-tot-topstories&quot;&gt;This is an article&lt;/a&gt; I heard about on Coast to Coast AM and I thought I would look into it. Apparently someone has been working on using radio waves to be used in a form of cancer treatment by bonding the cancer cells with nanites and using radiowaves to heat the cancer tissue. This has been used but only in limited ways, so this could be quite an expansion in cancer therapy. 

Last but not least we have &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071101/ap_on_fe_st/cheney_darth_vader;_ylt=AjVvrrg3B4ZvV7R2850WxVkuQE4F&quot;&gt;Darth Cheney&lt;/a&gt;? Yes apparently Cheney haas no problem being compared to the Dark lord Darth Vader, and why should he? It's not like it is going to hurt his feelings, or his pocket book, any more than anything else. so props to Cheney for running with a joke and proving that there is a human in there somewhere.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings October 30, 2007 (Moscow Ballet, Resolution 4204, Taser Boy and Pirates)</title>
      <description>I opened the show by tooting Wenatchee's horn, and deservedly so I think, with getting the only US performances of Swan Lake as performed by the Moscow Ballet. The first two shows sold out and one more has been added to the roster which will undoubtably sell out as well. This I think is quite a boon to Wenatchee. We have now landed a internationally known performance and MAYBE this will let other acts know that yes we are out here and yes we have built it, now will you come?

I then shift to a vote in the state of Washington that has bearings in the city of Wenatchee. The WA Resolution 4204 would allow simple majority in a vote for a school levy to pass (50% or more) instead of super majority (60%). So Since no matter what happens people will still be complaining since it is Property tax being used for schools I offer a suggestion that they instead use a sales tax and use that to pay for anything the schools might need.

After the break I mention a couple of articles that caught my eye on while browsing the net for news. One dealing with Cocoa, FL and its stance on masks for Halloween and the other with Sante Fe, NM and moving prairie dogs.

Then we get into &quot;Taser Boy (or Boi if you prefer) and the current press surrounding him. I honestly think the situation was handled right as he seemed to be egging things along after a while. Thats my point of view though and I go one to rant a bit on use your head if you want to avoid unpleasent outcomes.

Lastly I find a story on Piracy and wonder how previlant it is in modern day. It still is around, but in what capacity?

      <title>Rendal's Ravings October 23, 2007 (Vote by Mail, Iraq, Chris Benoit, SL Privates and staph)</title>
      <description>OK starting today is me bitching about how Washington state has switched to Vote by mail, but to be able to have your vote counted you have to get a stamp. So in short they are forcing you to pay for a basic freedom to participate in the electoral process.

Then I move on to my thoughts on Iraq and the army claiming at times that raids and bombings conducted don't yield any known civilian casualties. How do they know this? Do they have Civilian goggles that let all civilians show up one color and militants another?

OK after the music break I shoot on the WWE. Come on Vince pull you poker out of the Diva's and retrieve your spine. Chris Benoit is not going to be forgotten no matter how many white outs you use so just give the guy the props he deserves for the contributions he gave to the business. We all remember them and while your to chicken shit to admit it we will continue to long after we forget about you and your &quot;Genetic Jackhammer&quot;.

And on that note. I close out by talking a bit on Second life and fake genitals for avatars. Personally I don't get the use of them but thats me. I also touch a bit on the staph problem that seems to be hitting some areas to the point of closing some schools. If anyone can find me a map showing confirmed locations of this I would appreciate it.

      <itunes:summary>OK starting today is me bitching about how Washington state has switched to Vote by mail, but to be able to have your vote counted you have to get a stamp. So in short they are forcing you to pay for a basic freedom to participate in the electoral process.

Then I move on to my thoughts on Iraq and the army claiming at times that raids and bombings conducted don't yield any known civilian casualties. How do they know this? Do they have Civilian goggles that let all civilians show up one color and militants another?

OK after the music break I shoot on the WWE. Come on Vince pull you poker out of the Diva's and retrieve your spine. Chris Benoit is not going to be forgotten no matter how many white outs you use so just give the guy the props he deserves for the contributions he gave to the business. We all remember them and while your to chicken shit to admit it we will continue to long after we forget about you and your &quot;Genetic Jackhammer&quot;.

And on that note. I close out by talking a bit on Second life and fake genitals for avatars. Personally I don't get the use of them but thats me.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings October 16, 2007 (Furry Article, Net Sexuality and Timmy the Orc Retard)</title>
      <description>Today I talk more about the Santa Fe Reporter article about furries and about Storm Gryphon's comments in it. I try to be fair about it and even mention some of the main reservations I still have for the fandom/culture/religion...whatever Furry is now.

I also discuss how the internet seems to be helping blur the lines of gender when it comes to relationships online thanks to chat capabilities.

I also read a funny little clip someone I know wrote about World of Warcraft quests.

      <description>Talking about my luck with cars and how it would be nice to have one last a while and not cost me thousands. I also talk about how politicians should have a few shots for use with news paper articles so the photo can more closely match the mood of the article. I close by talking about the situation in Surfside Beach, Texas and give my impressions on it. That and some blather about Sl, WoW, The FBC in the news and other things.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings October 2, 2007 (SL VAT alleged tax Fraud, Viewer Authentication and Racism in Movies)</title>
      <description>Second Life (SL) apparently commits international tax fraud by using a Internet Law Article concerning EU VAT Tax to charge EU customers VAT Tax fees OVER AND ABOVE THE FEES ALREADY CHARGED. So needless to say I have quite a few words to say about this blatant bullshit by SL. I also mention a bit after this the new Viewer Authentication apparently being looked into and how yet again all their supposed problems would be solved by charging a initial sign up fee per account.

Then the topic shifts to Racism in movies and how people seem to use it more often as an excuse for why some movies shouldn't be out on DVD even though plenty already are.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings-September 18, 2007 (Surveys, September 11 (did I miss it? oh darn) and Screaming Bee)</title>
      <description>Start out today by mentioning a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ringsidecollectibles.com/ClassicSurvey2007.html&quot;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; run by a  toy company looking to see what action figures people would buy of wrestlers. 

Next is September 11, one week late I know but thats the point really. Why are people constantly trying to remind me of something that I could care less about? N o one I know died that day and in fact all it managed to do was ruin my parents 30th wedding Anniversary. People need to be more honest and stop saying &quot;Don't Forget&quot; when they mean &quot;We don't WANT you to forget&quot;.

After that I talk about something Warren Ellis wrote on his e-mail list about not doing a podcast and one reason being he doesn't like the sound of his own voice, which is one of the reasons I was hesitant, but now we have stuff like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.screamingbee.com/&quot;&gt;Screaming Bee&lt;/a&gt; things can change. I tried booting it up and running it through SAM (it didn't go through but you can faintly hear it sometimes, I have it working now) and did some talking as a woman and a &quot;tiny person&quot; which is just a helium voice. Quite a bit of fun actually.

The challange for this show is get &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.screamingbee.com/&quot;&gt;Screaming Bee&lt;/a&gt; and send in your voice as a man, woman and tiny person.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings august 29, 2007 (Pigeon Shit and School Bonds)</title>
      <description>I open up today talking about one of the more interesting explanations for the Minnestoa Bridge Collapse...Pigeon Shit? Ye folks I'm not kidding. One of the reasons for the bridge failing is apparently corrosive pigeon shit. Of coursde no one thought to CLEAN IT UP or anything.

Next up is a World of Warcraft Update talking about some of the fun things I'm encountering playng some of the different races/classes.

The main topic is the Wentchee Washington (WA) School bond failing yet again. Last time they lost by less than one percent, this time by almost six percent. So bascially this is me wondering what it will take to pass it?

One of the reasons for the bridge failing is apparently corrosive pigeon shit. Of coursde no one thought to CLEAN IT UP or anything.

Next up is a World of Warcraft Update talking about some of the fun things I'm encountering playng some of the different races/classes.

The main topic is the Wentchee Washington (WA) School bond failing yet again. Last time they lost by less than one percent, this time by almost six percent. So bascially this is me wondering what it will take to pass it?

      <description>Talked about legalizing internet gambling by using the Gaming Commission to monitor who can and can't run one and setting aside a portion of customer deposits to goto the taxes. I also discuss the problem with being an online affiliate right now with everything just being more of the same.

Then chatted a bit on World of Warcraft and how its helping relieve some tension caused by Second Life RP.

      <title>Rendal's Raving's August 7, 2007 (politics and Money)</title>
      <description>Well today I have a job interview so that is on my mind. I shift though to politics starting off by playing the aduio from a youtube video done by 2 Gryphon on global warming. From there I talk about how politicians should stop makin bullshit promises about fixing the big problems and start working on some problems they don't see as big but in the long run would help the economy.

Some examples would be like Gallagher's Helicopter idea for clearing stalled cars from highways or taking existsing parking lots and making parking spaces for motorcycles/mopeds so they don't take up full parking spaces. Another one woould be making C-Span a HDTV Channel so political nuts would have to get a HDTV to view it and the rest of us would be able to free up channels on cable for things we would actually like to watch.

After the music break I talk about Gallaghers idea of the Forty doors Resort and about how I would love t o see it  setup in Wenatchee. I also talk about the idea I have or opening a video arcade in town if I can find the games I want. Thn end asking if people think the Forty Doors Resort would work in thier town or not.

      <description>OK I know I'm touching on this late but hey, This show is going to focus on a still growing section of the Furry fandom and that is radio. Krayden from Australia asked 2 Gryphon on the 6/3/07 show why there isn't more furry talk shows..this is my response. Much bitching about feedback in this show, fair warning.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings June 5, 2007 (Second Life, pedophilia, age play, DJing)</title>
      <description>OK this one is going to be a hot one as I discuss Second Life's &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.secondlife.com/2007/05/31/keeping-second-life-safe-together&quot;&gt;Blog Post&lt;/a&gt; about cracking down on some &quot;unacceptable behavior&quot; in the system. This of course is a &quot;slippery slope&quot; post as while it is easy to agree with what they are doing now, what about later on down the road? And this is a &quot;Fantasy&quot;. why is it people now get to govern other's fantasies?

After that I talk about getting a new job as a DJ for the City of Lost Angels. The times so far are Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 10am-noon. &lt;A href=&quot;http://66.197.56.39:8414&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the stream page :)

      <itunes:summary>OK this one is going to be a hot one as I discuss Second Life's Blog Post about cracking down on some &quot;unacceptable behavior&quot; in the system. This of course is a &quot;slippery slope&quot; post as while it is easy to agree with what they are doing now, what about later on down the road? And this is a &quot;Fantasy&quot;. why is it people now get to govern other's fantasies?

After that I talk about getting a new job as a DJ for the City of Lost Angels. The times so far are Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 10am-noon. Here is a link to the stream page :)

Make sure you VOTE!&quot;.

The rest of the show is my thoughts on Memorial day and some of the events I've heard reported (Mainly flag burning and soldier grave desicration). I go off on many things here ultimately tying it up with reading a letter from Andrew J. Bacevich to the Washington Post that was printed in the Weekend Wenatche World Paper.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings May 22, 2007 (Videos, Soldier Censorship and Wenatchee School Bond)</title>
      <description>The show opens today with talking about some stuff I found while browsing videos this morning specifically the You Tube Guru &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/Urgelt&quot;&gt;Urgelt&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://montyoum.gametrailers.com/gamepad/&quot;&gt;Monty Oum video &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gametrailers.com/umwatcher.php?id=57998&quot;&gt;Haloid&lt;/a&gt;. From there I touch on the Government annoucing it is censoring US soldiers internet access using the pathetic excue of conserving bandwidth.

After the break I get to the main topic which is the Wenatchee, WA School bond (Resolution 03-07) which barely failed to pass, of course only ten thousand people even bothered to vote. The main source of controversy in this is WestSide High School which is an Alternative school. From here I go off on some of the reasons I think people are against it and of course our good frind N.I.M.B.Y. (Not In My Back Yard) is one of the reasons.

      <description>Quick mention of the May 12 Coast to Coast show about the bees and a thought on the earthquake. Then we get into &quot;phoney&quot; religions such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Pink_Unicorn&quot;&gt;The Invisible Pink Unicorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monsterism&quot;&gt;The Flying Spaghetti Monster&lt;/a&gt; and others and try to see why they couldn't be taken seriously using &lt;A href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot&quot;&gt;Russell's Teapot&lt;/A&gt; for basis. The show goes south when Maelynd and Matthew get going on nipples..Don't ask LOL

      <title>Rendal's Ravings May 1, 2007 (Death, Online and Lack of Imagination</title>
      <description>I start out rather out out of it as I just hear last night the a friend of mine in Second Life named Claire Glitterbuck. I then talk about how it really is dangerous in a sense to get to close to people online as you have no way of knowing if this happens to someone usually. 

I take a moment to lighten the mood playing a aol Parody called UGOTMAIL about America Inline and read a letter Woyro the Skunk sent in. This leads me to finding Podshow and broadcasting the signup process and the hints that accompany it.

Finally We talk a little about how people just can't seem to believe people can come up with good art without having some drug or substance involved. The example given is Alice in Wonderland. Then we close out with Norvak showing me that an imaginary friend was for sale on eBay...is there nothing people won't sell?

      <title>Rendal's Ravings April 24, 2007 (Apathy in Da HOUSE!)</title>
      <description>First off What is Humas?2 Sense quiestion brought up: Why didn't people stand up to the Virginia Tech shooter when he had a gun? How about why didn't the 9/11 &quot;victims&quot; stand up to people with BOX CUTTERS?! 

From there we go into the excuses offered for the Virginia Tech shooting. Was he a Loner or LONELY? Were Video Games responsable?  And why are game sites advertising games that no one interested in games would even remember.

I finish up talking about bullies and reading off a double dose of Bozo's of the week along with the thought of the day.

      <description>OK for those of you who have been waiting for me to just go off, the wait is over. The first part of the show focuses on changes over 50 years with how people react to certain things. I then go off on something I found in Ginmar's journal by Lee Iacocca on how the leaders of the nation have failed the people who elected them culminating in me announcing the official formation of the Furry Political Party.

I also about the honey bee problem that has been mentioned on Coast to Coast AM, updating the WWJD from What would Jesus Do? to Who Would Jesus do? and closing out mentioning my favorite Doomsday site Exit Mundi.

      <itunes:summary>I talk today about religion and going off on wondering what it would be like if Easter and April Fool's Day ended up falling on the same day. I also about the honey bee problem that has been mentioned on Coast to Coast AM, updating the WWJD from What would Jesus Do? to Who Would Jesus do? and closing out mentioning my favorite Doomsday site Exit Mundi.

      <title>Rendal's Ravings March 6, 2007 (CoLA Video, NIMBY and SAM)</title>
      <description>Started off talking about a video I narrated for the Second Life Vampire RP Community City of Lost Angel's. From there I joked about how long it takes Google to process video. After reading off the thought of the day and Bozo Criminal I take a music break replaying the TV theme of the previous Week as well as introduce a new feature to my podcasts, The Bud Light Real Men Of Genius ads.

Then I goty into the ugly topic of NIMBY (not in my back yard) and how it is rearing its head in East Wenatchee, WA. The rest of it is me bitching that SAM has messed up my Podcast stream file and the results of doing a Google Search on your own name.

      <description>During this past week wrestler &lt;A href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Bigelow&quot;&gt;Scott &quot;Bam Bam&quot; Bigelow&lt;/a&gt; died and it sent me off on think about death for a while. How some deaths we see coming, some catch us out of the blue and still others sneak by not making themselves know for a while. I also talk about the ranings for this show on Podomatics Society and Culture section and how the show Flash in the Pan now has its own &lt;a href=&quot;http://fitp.podomatic.com&quot;&gt;Podomatic Archive&lt;/a&gt;.

 All this as well as the &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.wallerbroadcasting.com/bozo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bozo criminal of the Day&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refdesk.com/totd-arch.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thought of the day&lt;/a&gt; along with uncovering the great &lt;A href=http://chrisdolley.livejournal.com/65951.html&quot;&gt;Nigerian Tune Scam&lt;/A&gt;.</description>

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 16, 2007 (SL and Compensation)</title>

I start off actually though talking about CoLA's new DJ &lt;a href=&quot;http://djdigital-pixie.livejournal.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Digital Enigma&lt;/A&gt; and how much fun she is to listen to then go off talking about a neat map I found over at &lt;a href=&quot;http://tailen.livejournal.com/56439.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tailen's Journal&lt;/a&gt; that matches states annual income with GNP's of countries.

Also played some songs today so here they are :) Enjoy the show and remember to look for the Angel of Compensation. &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.advfilms.co.uk/titles/hellsing/armoury/cannon.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; incidentally is Speyeder's Weapon SL.

Songs

      <title>Rendal's Ravings January 9, 2007 (More on Art, SL, Blurring the Lines and Search Engine chatter)</title>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.podomatic.net/mymedia/thumb/39363/600x600_662132.gif&quot; alt=&quot;itunes pic&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I start off by talking a bit about the weather and the site &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comicartfans.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Comic Art Fans&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which I found a nice nude pinup of the &lt;B&gt;Marvel Comics&lt;/b&gt; character &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comicartfans.com/GalleryPiece.asp?Piece=51024&amp;GSub=1495&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;AOA Blink (NOT WORKSAFE)&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

I then resume my discussion from last week about differences in &lt;a href=&quot;http://goaddr.com/fgw&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Second Life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and real life discussing teleporting (even mentioning Real Life rumors of teleporting experiments, namely Russian) and having children in SL which seems odd but could fullfill a need for Real Life couples who can' have kids need for one. 

I also talk about a project called Blurring the Lines that I'm toying around with dealing with Second life characters switching places with their real life counterparts. I'm not sure if it should be written as a tv series or as a movie, though I'm leaning to series build up and then movie.

Then as time winds down I check the stats and talk about how using a good description in your podcast can lead to surprise hits from search engines.

      <description>Ok this week we start out talking about the memorial service for Gerald Ford and move on to things that differ between Real life and Online life. Things discussed are mainly what makes sense in one world and seems rediculous in another. &lt;A href=&quot;http://www.wallerbroadcasting.com/bozo/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bozo criminal of the Day&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.refdesk.com/totd-arch.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;thought of the day&lt;/a&gt; show up as well as the results of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darwinawards.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Darwin Awards&lt;/a&gt;.</description>
