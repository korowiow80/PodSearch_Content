        <description>President-Elect Obama presents himself as a committed Christian, yet co-sponsored the most sweeping piece of pro-abortion legislation ever proposed in Congress. He also supports partial-birth abortions and no aid to those born alive in botched, late term abortions.

Solomon also claimed to be a committed believer; nevertheless, he was the first ruler to allow and even participate in the abominable worship of Molech, which required live child sacrifices.
