            <description>In the words of Jay Bradley (all rights reserved)
Danielle Dark is the story of a vampire not entirely accustomed to what she is. Danielle is trying to fit into mortal society, but discovers that is more difficult than she imagined.

Turned just over 150 years ago, Danielle is a relatively young vampire, but the circumstances of her change have made her a vampire with additional abilities. The fact that Danielle is different than other vampires has not escaped the attention of various entities with their own agendas. Some merely wish to observe Danielleâ??s activities, while others want her cooperation. There are also those who want Danielle destroyed.

Fortunately, Danielle Dark is a formidable vampire with equally formidable allies. But her biggest challenge is to accept herself for what she is. Find out more about Danielle Dark each week. Updates are every Friday.</description>

            <description>In the words of the author(All Rights Reserved)
Welcome friend to Cwen&apos;s Question....Quest QUEST! Cwen&apos;s Quest. The product of the dare I say momumental collaboration between myself the Emperor of Evil and SarahN. Cwen&apos;s Quest is very special for me as it is the third comic I&apos;m currently collaborating on with a successful female artist who does a vampire comic. I&apos;m sure that says something about me but I really don&apos;t know what.

As I hope you can tell I&apos;m very excited about Cwen&apos;s Quest. I&apos;ve been a fan of SarahN work for a long time; I even had the privilege of giving Jack his last name, or rather his &apos;real&apos; last name (true story), so getting the chance to work with her is a dream come true.

Cwen&apos;s quest follow the Kill Bill style adventure of Cwen, except as if it had been written by Kevin Smith and directed by Mel Brooks! You know actually, it isn&apos;t much like that at all and I think you&apos;ll just have to stick with us to find out what it is like. You&apos;ll like it though, trust me. So sit back and enjoy Cwen&apos;s Question....QUEST! Cwen&apos;s Quest!

            <description>Allen Steadham was born and raised in Texas. He started drawing original comics as a hobby in 1980. His interests were in mostly serious, sometimes funny, sometimes dark superhero team comics for about two decades.
Allen and Angel met in 1991and married in 1995. By 1994, Angel had agreed to help Allen edit and help co-write the superhero comics.

In September 1995, Angel decided that, after deeply contemplating her life, she would give Jesus Christ a try. Allen did not immediately follow suit but did not oppose her decision. However, after seeing the positive, evident changes in Angel&apos;s life (and, shortly after, experiencing a life-and-death moment of his own), he also decided to try Christ for himself.

Allen attempted to continue the creation of his superhero comics, minus the various negative-themed inflections formerly employed that he no longer identified with. Within a few years, though, the superhero comics became less and less satisfying.

Then Allen had a new inspiration in 1999. He begun ideas for a comic that reflected his Christian experience and beliefs, and he very much wanted to co-create these new concepts with his wife, Angel. By 2003, the basic groundwork for Due East was in place. Allen and Angel debuted the comic on an online comic hub called &apos;Keenspot&apos; (now called &apos;Comic Genesis&apos;). By May 2007, Due East was well into Book Two. Allen and Angel started mirroring Due East on a new comic hub called &apos;Drunk Duck&apos;. Over the months following, Due East developed a growing, loyal following.

In June 2008, Allen and Angel expanded the Due East development by creating its own fully independent website. This site now includes the full Due East book archives and all the aspects of the Due East experience in one ad-free environment, complete with its own blog and forum -- dueeastcomic.com!</description>

            <description>A few words about George Ford in his own words (All Rights Reserved)
Greetings, Dear Reader! My name is George Ford. Iâ??m the guy whose bright idea it was to create a funny-haired little character named Hank Addanac. I take the credit, as well as the blame.

Lemme give you a little background on who I am. There are two versions of the story. This first part is the â??official company spielâ??. Read, enjoy, and marvel. Hahahaha!

â??George W. Ford, Jr. has been a professional graphic artist for over twenty years. He graduated from Virginia State University (located in Petersburg, VA) in 1994 with a BFA in Visual Communication/Commercial Art. 

As a youth, Ford was commissioned to be the resident cartoonist for Halifax Countyâ??s local newspaper, The Gazette-Virginian. He was the creator and artist of three features which were published three times per week. His work led various newspapers in the region to call upon other young, fledgling cartoonists to create comic strips for them. George has won numerous awards for his artistic endeavors throughout elementary and high school.

After graduating from college, Ford went to work as a computer graphic artist at Annin Flags (formerly Dettra Flags, Inc.), the largest flag-manufacturing company in the United States. Several of his projects went on to win awards for creativity at industry conventions in Las Vegas. 

While still employed with Annin Flags, Ford developed the comic strip, Addanac City. It was such a huge success, with fan mail arriving daily, that he decided to launch it as a comic book series. Addanac City the comic book sold exceptionally well, at times, making it the top-selling periodical in the area, second only to the newspaper. Six self-contained stories were published with Ford serving as writer, pencil artist, inker, and colorist. An additional book, which was a collection of published comic strips, also found its way into readersâ?? hands. The soaring popularity of Addanac City and its flagship character, Hank, prompted Ford to develop many commercial tie-ins. The area was inundated with t-shirts, posters, coffee mugs, Christmas ornaments, and other products.

George is not one to rest on his laurels. After leaving the flag company for greener pastures, he soon joined Homeplace Creations, a privately-owned ceramics pottery company in Halifax, VA. His duties included sketching designs on various pottery and ornaments which were then passed on to other artists for coloring. He also personally hand-painted many of the pieces of pottery. Soon thereafter, Ford was placed in charge of custom work, utilizing his talent to satisfy the individual needs of the customers. His diligence and eye for detail led to the company being flooded with custom-work orders during the Christmas season. Everyone pined for a personal work of art.

Ford has also delved into the arena of playwriting. He has written several full-length plays, mainly comedies. As an artist, George designed the playbills and advertisements for his plays. He has two plays which are in consideration for production in the near future, and he is in talks for one play to be developed into a movie. He has also cultivated an ongoing relationship with the Halifax County Little Theatre, serving as playbill artist for many of their productions. He also made his foray into acting, portraying Walter Lee Younger in the Lorraine Hansberry-penned A Raisin in the Sun. The performances garnered rave reviews and received positive critical accolades.

Currently, George is the president of Ford Graphic Entertainment. He creates freelance artwork for clients all over the country (and some even abroad). He has created book illustrations, t-shirt and fashion design, as well as commercial advertisements. He is married to â??the most wonderful woman in the worldâ??, Traviett Jernigan Ford. The gorgeous couple resides in sunny Southern California with their two children and cat, Bootsy.â??</description>

            <itunes:summary>A few words about George Ford in his own words (All Rights Reserved)
Greetings, Dear Reader! My name is George Ford. Iâ??m the guy whose bright idea it was to create a funny-haired little character named Hank Addanac. I take the credit, as well as the blame.

Lemme give you a little background on who I am. There are two versions of the story. This first part is the â??official company spielâ??. Read, enjoy, and marvel. Hahahaha!

â??George W. Ford, Jr. has been a professional graphic artist for over twenty years. He graduated from Virginia State University (located in Petersburg, VA) in 1994 with a BFA in Visual Communication/Commercial Art. 

As a youth, Ford was commissioned to be the resident cartoonist for Halifax Countyâ??s local newspaper, The Gazette-Virginian. He was the creator and artist of three features which were published three times per week. His work led various newspapers in the region to call upon other young, fledgling cartoonists to create comic strips for them. George has won numerous awards for his artistic endeavors throughout elementary and high school.

After graduating from college, Ford went to work as a computer graphic artist at Annin Flags (formerly Dettra Flags, Inc.), the largest flag-manufacturing company in the United States. Several of his projects went on to win awards for creativity at industry conventions in Las Vegas. 

While still employed with Annin Flags, Ford developed the comic strip, Addanac City. It was such a huge success, with fan mail arriving daily, that he decided to launch it as a comic book series.

            <description>Tony Kinnard is a 22 year old native of Burlington Wisconsin, and also a college graduate with a B.A. in Illustration, and a degree to make cartoons. Such a waste of a couple thousand, ain&apos;t it?

Tonys biggest inspirations are Bill Watterson of Calvin and Hobbes fame, Monty Python, George Carlin, and a really messed up imagination. To help pay the bills, Tony became an erotic dancer...nah, I&apos;m kidding

Tony is currently working on making another book along with working on other projects, including voice acting work and an animated series based on Negligence.</description>

            <description>Capes n Babes was originally envisioned as a graphic novel.
About eight years or so ago, I went to the Small Press Expo in Bethesda, Maryland. It was there that I discovered a wonderful little comic book called The Copybook Tales. It told the story of two friends - a writer and an artist as they remembered their childhood adventures. The story essentially was a flashback of then and now. It was a great book and I eventually found the trade paperback.

But it helped spawn an idea. At the time, I was still into serious super-hero booksÃ¢?Â¦ Batman, X-Men, Captain America and all the rest but thanks to the first trip to the SPX, I was suddenly getting into more self-published work. So much so that I started creating my own story.

Inspired by The Copybook Tales, I started writing about my high school memories of hanging out at the local comic book shop. The characters started flying out of my brain. The stories were too. The only problem was I could never get it right whether it was the style (realistic) or the story (drama/autobiographical). Although I thought it was a good concept - a story about a comic book shop - I could never seem to get it right.

But the idea never left my brain. In fact, many of the original story elements are still there:
Capes n Babes is based on a real store and a real strip mall.

            <description>Brian Anderson of Dog Eat Dog joins the Villains Corner to talk about his syndicated comic on Creators Syndicate!
Brian&apos;s earliest cartoon memories are of drawing James Bond-esque comics in second grade. His cartoons appeared in monthly grammar-school newsletters and then jumped to the St. John&apos;s High School paper (where he promptly found himself in the principal&apos;s office explaining the meaning of a giant soap-on-rope that had crushed a small sedan). 

Public debate over his cartoons followed him to Holy Cross, where his strip was the most-read feature next to the sports section. Escaping the walls of academia in 1996, Brian pursued a career as a graphic designer and comic book artist. With comic book work scarce, Brian published his own comic book series, Absence of Light. He also worked as an editorial cartoonist for his hometown newspaper, The Town Crier. 

Brian sent his college strip to the syndicates in 1998. Although there was interest in developing the feature, Brian knew this wasn&apos;t the strip for him. For the next few years, Brian spread his focus on his dark comic book visions and fledgling screenwriting career. 

All that changed in 2003. In a matter of months, he became a husband, a homeowner and father of a chocolate Labrador puppy. With the support of his wife, Tammy, and the inspiration of his dog, Sophie, he created Dog eat Doug. The daily strip debuted online in 2005 and continues to enjoy a growing, international fan base</description>

            <description>Bear VS. Zombies is an action, adventure, humor comic that updates every Monday. It started in in December of 2008 and have been picking up steam ever since. Zaymac came up with the idea for BVZ after he started reading The Walking Dead comic book series. Zaymac had this bear character that had been laying around for a fews years in my sketchbook, but he didn&apos;t know what to do with him. Then he thought, in every zombie apocalypse story, you always see it from the human perspective, I wonder how animals would react. From that BVZ was born. Obviously it&apos;s not quite as serious as some other zombie tales, but Zaymac said that he really don&apos;t do serious. He actually don&apos;t even care for zombies all that much, I just think they make great fodder for storytelling. Its Zaymacs hope that everyone enjoys the story that he is telling, and he does have an ending, but it will be awhile before he reach it, so he hope you all stick around.</description>
