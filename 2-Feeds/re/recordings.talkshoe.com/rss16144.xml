            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Finance&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Harold Lustig. He will talk about how to pay for long term care (LTC), even if you have little or no savings. Did you know that if you run out of money while in a long-term care facility, they can repossess your funeral plot? Or that people in LTC who are far from their adult children have shorter life spans than those with children nearby? Another little known fact is that there are more than 40-percent of people in LTC who are under age 65 - which means it&apos;s really younger, healthier people who need to learn about and plan for LTC, not just seniors.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Natural Healing&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Dr. Noel Thomas. She will explain about Neurofeedback (also known as EEG biofeedback) that is a non-invasive and scientifically proven therapy that trains the brain and central nervous system to function more efficiently and strengthen its own neurological connections. Once the brain has learned how to better self-regulate, the changes are generally maintained for life. Neurofeedback is a high tech brainwave biofeedback. It helps to optimize the brain&apos;s bio-electrical activity by improving neural communication and self-regulation. In the process, mood, behavior, attention and motivation improve and anxiety is reduced or resolved. It is a proven therapy for addressing many mental and emotional issues without the use of medication. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Education&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Brooke Hauser. She will talk about two pressing issues in American: education and immigration to offer an alternative to a lot of recent chatter on these topics by telling a positive story on both fronts. She spent about a year chronicling the lives of recently arrived immigrants from around the world starting school at Brooklyn&apos;s International High School at Prospect Heights. Many of them overcame unimaginable difficulties to reach the United States. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

She will talk about two pressing issues in American: education and immigration to offer an alternative to a lot of recent chatter on these topics by telling a positive story on both fronts. She spent about a year chronicling the lives of recently arrived immigrants from around the world starting school at Brooklyn&apos;s International High School at Prospect Heights. Many of them overcame unimaginable difficulties to reach the United States. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</itunes:summary>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Green &amp; Sustainable&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Taggart Siegel. He is the filmmaker of the documentary, &quot;Queen of the Sun&quot; that is about the effort to pollinate awareness about the declining, global bee population called colony collapse. As Carlo Petrini explains in the film, &quot;If we kill all the bees, there will be no agriculture. I repeat, no agriculture. Bees are the pollinators that guarantee fruit growth and survival.&quot; The emphasis in the film is the biodynamic and organic communities that have deep and profound insights into the long-term issues that have brought about the recent collapse. It&apos;s all about bee survival and our own. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

Birds are part of the angelic realm and, like their traditional counterparts, they bring messages of divine guidance at a time when we need to hear them. Each bird brings its own specific message for you to apply in your life. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;History&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Jodi Lorimer. Find out about the Labyrinth in the Paleolithic. The first modern humans in Paleolithic Europe painted the labyrinth journey to the Otherworld on the walls of deep caves (in photo above) over 32,000 years ago. Ancient shamans mapped the route of the labyrinth revealing the complex minds and spirit of a sophisticated people. To understand the significance of this mythological symbol requires that we dig into the very core of human experience and tread the paradoxical paths of belief and biology, history and myth, and discover where they cross over into transcendence, at the Center.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Growth&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Dr. Eric Wolterstorff of the Love and Trauma Center. He will explain some secrets of trauma psychotherapy: we store traumatic experiences through three different kinds of memory, as if we were using three separate brains. You&apos;ll learn about how each kind of memory is healed in a different way...and much healing can be done on your own and with the help of a trained psychotherapist. His book, &quot;Love and Trauma&quot; will teach you how and be available in bookstores in 2012. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Film&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Nik Fackler, 25, director of &quot;Lovely Still&quot; that stars actors Martin Landau and Ellen Burstyn in a romance that is complicated by Alzheimer&apos;s. Fackler began writing and directing short films during high school in Omaha, Nebraska. His work as a painter and filmmaker was quickly recognized by members of Omaha&apos;s acclaimed music scene, and before long he was directing music videos and stage backing videos for bands such as Bright Eyes, Cursive, Tilly and the Wall, Sia, The Elected and many others. He chose never to attend college, deciding instead to continue writing and shooting music videos in Omaha, all while searching for support for his first feature-length screenplay. The heartfelt narrative - which would become &quot;Lovely Still&quot; - combined a genuine warmth and surprising maturity that enthralled some of the film industry&apos;s most impressive actors and craftsmen.

            <description>Many parents are unconsciously passing on an inheritance of psychological pain and emotional void-ness. The children are paying too heavy a price for this lack of consciousness. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Growth&quot; talks, Dr. Shefali Tsabary, Ph.D. believes that time has come to shirt the entire paradigm of parenting on its head. She turns it around to not allow for any such safe illusion of allowing the parent to focus on the child. Instead, her message is that children can be raised into conscious adults only when the parents have allowed themselves to be raised into a higher state of consciousness.

            <description>Written by foreign correspondent Stephen Kinzer, he argues that two countries in the region are America&apos;s logical partners in the 21st century: Iran and Turkey. Kinzer bases his new &quot;Power Triangle&quot; on the similarities between the countries. They share strategic interests, like a stable Iraq, stable Afghanistan, and stable Pakistan, and their people share a desire for democratic values. He recommends that the U.S. reshape relations with its two, traditional Middle East allies: Israel and Saudi Arabia. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>Parents of previous generations had to &quot;let go&quot; when their kids left home, but with current technology, parent don&apos;t have to, and most students don&apos;t want them to. As a result, the long and winding road to adulthood keeps getting longer, with many students incapable of handling their responsibilities independently. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Parenting&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Abigail Sullivan Moore. She&apos;ll explain about what is an iConnected Parent - when it&apos;s good and when it&apos;s detrimental; how all this contact can delay kid&apos;s ability to grow up; how frequent cell phone usage can make parents and kids more anxious; and more.

            <description>In no country is the Constitution so respected and revered and disregarded as in the United States. Many Americans, encouraged by public figures such as Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh and Ron Paul believe that a major solution to our nation&apos;s ills is to restore the &quot;constitutional republic&quot; and return this country to its constitutional principles. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Political&quot; talks, listen to an interview with historian, Mark Weber. He will tackle such questions as these: What do those who call for a &quot;constitutional republic&quot; really want? How realistic is this goal? Just what would a return to constitutional principles mean? How important is a constitution in defining a society? Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Medical Care&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Andrew Bernstein. He&apos;ll explain that the way we think about stress and more importantly, how we deal with it, is completely wrong. We generally believe that negative emotions come from what&apos;s going on in our lives. In reality, these emotions come from our thoughts about what&apos;s going in our lives. Stress management tools like exercise and relaxation don&apos;t affect these thoughts, so the stress keeps coming back.

the suburbs, Pasricha started his blog as a small reminder of the free, easy little joys that make life sweet. Today, his site gets over 10 million readers worldwide. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Fitness&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Carolinda Witt from Australia. She will explain about an ancient set of exercises from Tibet called T5T that can dramatically slow down aging and prevent illness. It is done through specific yoga postures, &quot;energetic breathing,&quot; and spinning the body to spin all of the chakras (seven energy centers on the body) at the same rate. When the spin rate is slowed or blocked, the vital life force energy cannon circulate and illness and aging set in. Many worldwide have experienced remarkable results from practicing T5T for a few minutes daily. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Death &amp; Dying&quot; talks, listen to an interview about joining the Home Funeral Movement. There is a growing interest by many to bypass the expensive funeral industry to exercise their individual &quot;rights&quot; to care for their own at death. Instead of handing over a loved one&apos;s body to a mortician for embalming and display before cremation or burial, another alternative is individualized funeral rites (based on culture and beliefs) and eco-friendly burials. Crossings is a leading resource on family directed after-life care. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>The true story of Anastasia from the Russian taiga forests of Siberia is a remarkable one. Written by Vladimir Megre, he discovered Anastasia in 1995 and wrote about her story from many conversations with her. She was born in the forest in 1969 to parents who died tragically when she was a baby. Raised and cared for by animals in the wild, Anastasia learned to live peacefully and in harmony with Nature. Her message to the world has touched and changed millions of lives. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Eco-Friendly &amp; Sustainability&quot; talks, listen to publisher and literary translator Dr. Leonid Sharashkin about Book 3. You&apos;ll get a behind-the-scenes understanding about the armed men with machine guns who got a taste of hell from Anastasia after trying to capture her; raising Vladamir&apos;s baby boy with the help of animals; and a school within the forest attended by 7 to 17-year-olds who are mostly self-taught with hardly any adult supervision. They can complete a 10-year math syllabus in one year, while learning three foreign languages, martial arts and ballroom dancing.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Political&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Juan Cole. He is the leading national authority on foreign policy between the Western and Muslim World. His ideas to improve relations include a constructive withdrawal of troops from Iraq as the only way forward, and may actually be the best catalyst for a compromise between the Shiite government and Sunni Arabs; Iran as not being the incorrigible enemy; Green Energy is the next step, but will require the cooperation of the old fossil fuel producers with the consuming nations; and more.

            <description>Until now, the cause of Osteoarthritis has been unknown until recently from medical research done in Australia. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Natural Healing&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Len Smith, CEO/President of BSP Pharma Inc., about their remarkable product called FlexNow that contains shea nut from West Africa. The nut is known to have the highest concentration of inflammation fighters called triterpenes - leading to a dramatic reduction in the breakdown of collagen, which makes up 70% of cartilage and significantly reduces the pain. Taking glucosamine is not enough. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Natural Healing&quot; talks, Dr. Alan Greenberg of Chelorex is back to talk about how he came up with a formula to naturally remove heavy metal toxicity from the body. He warns about the harmful effects of heavy metal poisoning (like mercury) that&apos;s found in foods, crown fillings, vaccinations, water and air. Many products on the market are either non-effective or partially effective, which includes liquid zeolite, synthetic chelators like EDTA, and others.

            <description>If you&apos;re a Michael Crichton or Stephen King fan, then you&apos;ll love to hear from Scott Sigler, the author of &quot;Contagious&quot;. It&apos;s rare that you&apos;ll read a techno-thriller that is backed up by lots of hard science, like in this story about a mysterious disease sweeping across America that transforms ordinary people into violent, paranoid murderers. The only explanation: the epidemic is driven not by evolution, but by some unknown intelligence. The story&apos;s best weapon is a former football star named Perry Dawsey.

            <description>This is about our soldiers in Iraq unlike any other. Before falling into battle, a soldier named First Sergeant Charles Monroe King wrote a journal about life lessons for his unborn son, Jordan, in case he did not make it home from Iraq. King, 48, was killed on Oct. 14, 2006. His son, Jordan, was seven months old. Within the pages are wrenching accounts of losing men in battle and with advice on everything from withstanding disappointment to behaving on a date. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Parenting&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Dana Canedy, (who was married to King) about the journal that will be made into a movie by famous actor Denzel Washington.

            <description>Adam Shepard graduated from college in the summer of 2006 feeling disillusioned by the apathy he saw around him. Eager to see if he could make something out of nothing, he set out to prove wrong the theory that those who start at the bottom stay at the bottom, and to see if the American Dream can still be a reality. Carrying only a sleeping bag, the clothes on his back and $25 in cash, his goal was to have, after a year, $2,500, a working car, and a furnished apartment.
