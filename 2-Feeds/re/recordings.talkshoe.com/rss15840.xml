        <description>The New Series of a ITune hit, Now with an feminine energy. &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; is a Spiritual Path to Enlightenment which leads to awakening. &quot;ACIM&quot; is done at your own time, where ever you are. Enlightenment is best described as a change a perspective of everything you think you know and see. Awakening is a release from the Dream in witch we think we sleep. The Course (and many other things) are here to remove blocks witch keep us from viewing truth. Truth is beyond what we see now. We Search for Truth in everything, We search for Love, Happiness and peace were it is not. It is not in these blocks, where we look... it is beyond what you and ego think you know. I am here to help you understand A Course in Miracles, as I also am trying to do, here with you.--- This is a course in miracles... It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love&apos;s presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:Nothing real can be threatened.Nothing unreal exists.Herein lies the peace of God ... ...

False Empathy &amp; True Empathy
- - Please send us any questions or comments to; OpenacnClear@GMail.com - - The New Series of a ITune hit, Now with fun feminine energy. A show that covers our adventures with spirit. Topics include relationship following our inner guidance and much laughter. A course in miracles is used predominately as the source of inspiration for the show and our lives. A course in miracles is a book that goes beyond normal new age spirituality . It involves deep mind training that changes the way we look at the world . Other teachers of the course are Regina Dawn Akers. Marianne Williamson. Earl raj Purdy lisa Natoli. Wayne Dyer, David Hoffmiester to name a few. - -

&quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; is a Spiritual Path to Enlightenment which leads to awakening. &quot;ACIM&quot; is done at your own time, where ever you are. Enlightenment is best described as a change a perspective of everything you think you know and see. Awakening is a release from the Dream in witch we think we sleep. The Course (and many other things) are here to remove blocks witch keep us from viewing truth. Truth is beyond what we see now. We Search for Truth in everything, We search for Love, Happiness and peace were it is not. It is not in these blocks, where we look... it is beyond what you and ego think you know. I am here to help you understand A Course in Miracles, as I also am trying to do, here with you.--- This is a course in miracles... It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love&apos;s presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:Nothing real can be threatened.Nothing unreal exists.Herein lies the peace of God.</description>

The Levels of ego thought, 
What is judgment,
Can I experience judgmentlessness?

- - Please send us any questions or comments to; OpenacnClear@GMail.com - - The New Series of a ITune hit, Now with fun feminine energy. A show that covers our adventures with spirit. Topics include relationship following our inner guidance and much laughter. A course in miracles is used predominately as the source of inspiration for the show and our lives. A course in miracles is a book that goes beyond normal new age spirituality . It involves deep mind training that changes the way we look at the world . Other teachers of the course are Regina Dawn Akers. Marianne Williamson. Earl raj Purdy lisa Natoli. Wayne Dyer, David Hoffmiester to name a few. - -

&quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; is a Spiritual Path to Enlightenment which leads to awakening. &quot;ACIM&quot; is done at your own time, where ever you are. Enlightenment is best described as a change a perspective of everything you think you know and see. Awakening is a release from the Dream in witch we think we sleep. The Course (and many other things) are here to remove blocks witch keep us from viewing truth. Truth is beyond what we see now. We Search for Truth in everything, We search for Love, Happiness and peace were it is not. It is not in these blocks, where we look... it is beyond what you and ego think you know. I am here to help you understand A Course in Miracles, as I also am trying to do, here with you.--- This is a course in miracles... It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love&apos;s presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:Nothing real can be threatened.Nothing unreal exists.Herein lies the peace of God.</description>

Todays Major topics include;
Why does it seem the grass is always greener on the other side?
What is the grass?
I am the grass, must I protect my-self with a fence? 
Why do we need to keep separated? 
- - Please send us any questions or comments to; OpenacnClear@GMail.com - - The New Series of a ITune hit, Now with fun feminine energy. A show that covers our adventures with spirit. Topics include relationship following our inner guidance and much laughter. A course in miracles is used predominately as the source of inspiration for the show and our lives. A course in miracles is a book that goes beyond normal new age spirituality . It involves deep mind training that changes the way we look at the world . Other teachers of the course are Regina Dawn Akers. Marianne Williamson. Earl raj Purdy lisa Natoli. Wayne Dyer, David Hoffmiester to name a few. - -

&quot;A Course in Miracles&quot; is a Spiritual Path to Enlightenment which leads to awakening. &quot;ACIM&quot; is done at your own time, where ever you are. Enlightenment is best described as a change a perspective of everything you think you know and see. Awakening is a release from the Dream in witch we think we sleep. The Course (and many other things) are here to remove blocks witch keep us from viewing truth. Truth is beyond what we see now. We Search for Truth in everything, We search for Love, Happiness and peace were it is not. It is not in these blocks, where we look... it is beyond what you and ego think you know. I am here to help you understand A Course in Miracles, as I also am trying to do, here with you.--- This is a course in miracles... It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love&apos;s presence, which is your natural inheritance. The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.This course can therefore be summed up very simply in this way:Nothing real can be threatened.Nothing unreal exists.Herein lies the peace of God.</description>

Todays Major topics include;

-Being clowns in the Merrie Monarch Parade in Hilo HI.

-Am I in Heaven, What is my Purpose to being lost?

- - Please send us any questions or comments to; OpenacnClear@GMail.com - -


Q #679: I have always enjoyed the whole idea that the journey, A Course in Miracles, the return to God, is not an if but a when. The journey is sure because once the idea of separation entered our minds, time &quot;rolled out&quot; and then the journey to return began with time &quot;rolling up&quot; along a path that takes us nowhere but back to our Father (ultimately, though the path is wide and offers room to wander). However, in the Epilogue (C.ep) I see for the first time in the Course an element of uncertainty; namely, &quot;Our new beginning has the certainty the journey lacked till now.&quot; Further, the Epilogue hints strongly that we started this journey before and got lostâ?¦that it is an &quot;ancient journey&quot; leading to an &quot;ancient door&quot; that is held open by the &quot;Holy of Holies.&quot; But for some reason, our path was not sure. I&apos;m confused about this; can you please shed some light on this?
