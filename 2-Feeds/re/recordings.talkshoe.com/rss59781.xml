            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Natural Healing&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Trish Schwenkler, a top earning distributor for ASEA. She will talk about ASEA&apos;s Redox Signaling Molecules that are foundational to cellular health and proper function. Redox Signaling Molecules are naturally found within cells to support cellular communication; protect against free radical damage; boost efficiency of the body&apos;s own antioxidants by up to 500%; help to make the action of some nutrients and blood messengers (such as hormones and insulin more efficient); and other benefits. The ASEA product is a perfectly balanced mixture of Redox Signaling reactive molecules that exists outside of the body as a supplement to support it on a cellular level.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Political&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Bob Reiss. He has traveled to the Arctic 7 times to determine just how vulnerable the United States is in the race for resources and security in the Arctic. This summer Shell Oil company plans to sink exploratory wells in the pristine waters off the North Slope of Alaska - a field that the company believes may contain three times as much oil as has been taken from the Gulf of Mexico since 1990, possibly 27 billion barrels. Is it oil, other resources, shipping rights and shortcuts or national security? All question American superiority in the region.

In the wake of the disaster at Japan&apos;s Fukushima Daiichi plant, he proposes the development and deployment of a fleet of small, inherently save nuclear powre reactors. It&apos;s a move away from huge, multi-megawatt plants to much smaller (container-sized) modular plants to produce clean energy at the local level - getting us off the worst of our fossil-fuel gluttony within a decade.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Growth&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Lydia Belton, fondly known as Dr. Tranquility. According to her, the reason that many people make repeated mistakes in choosing their relationship partners is that they they think they want certain characteristics, values and behaviors on a conscious level, but what they really want is hidden in the deep layers of their subconscious mind. Thus, they are picking partners who are destined to ultimately make them unhappy and are not a good match for who they are. Date therapy is designed to get past that using hypnotherapy to find someone who matches your true values. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Science&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Lawrence Krauss. He will discuss about the current picture of the Universe, how it will end, and how it could have come from nothing. The latest physics research into the origins of the Universe shows that, not only can our universe arise from nothing, but more generally, the laws of quantum mechanics and relativity imply that something will generally always arise from nothing. Even space, and the very laws of physics, may so arise. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>Unwanted and negative emotions are like lead on our bodies. When we release and clear unwanted emotional baggage and patterns, we are able to live with a calm clarity. The triggers that caused negative responses from the collective, our cultural, childhood programming and beliefs no longer have such a strong effect on us. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Growth&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Rowena McKee. She will explain about the Art of Emotional Alchemy that is an inner healing process that uses Meridian Psychotherapy, Energy Psychology, EFT and Mind Body Medicine Techniques to release resistant emotions.

            <itunes:summary>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Employment&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Pam Lassiter. She&apos;ll explain that the new job security of today is not dependent on expecting a company to support you until retirement. Job security is alive and well and centered in you, not a company. She offers five best strategies for achieving work security and success to help you uncover interesting alternative jobs; generate multiple income streams; shape your job so that it reflects your values and goals; move successfully within your company; and plan for career transitions so that they&apos;re under your control.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Finance&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Steve Olsher. According to him, parents are better off playing the Lotto than paying for your 18-year-old to go to college if you want to realize a decent return on your investment. Your child will not only have the responsibility of a high student loan to pay back, but there&apos;s also the great possibility of not pursuing the career or landing a job within their chosen major/area of focus after graduation. Olsher offers good alternatives that can benefit the parents and their child. Hosted by Beyond 50&apos;s intern, Devin DeCuna.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Finance&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Kimberly Palmer. If you are a parent with a young adult earning a living, this discussion is for the both of you. Today&apos;s young professionals have taken on more debt than previous generations, but they are not slackers living off of credit cards as many believe. Palmer will discuss about the 3 phases of life that relate to finance: 1. Building Your Life (topics include &quot;The Joy of Spending&quot; and &quot;The Upside of Debt&quot;), 2. Creating a Home (like &quot;Lessons in Modern Frugality&quot; and &quot;When Parents are Landlords (or Renters)&quot;), and 3. Changing the World (such as &quot;Nonprofit Dreamin&apos;). You&apos;ll especially want to learn about stock investing that&apos;s specifically for the 20-somethings.

            <description>There&apos;s nothing wrong with &quot;living in the now&quot; - except that it&apos;s only part of our story. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Growth&quot; talks, listen to an interview with John P. Schuster. He&apos;ll expose the many ways we ignore, distort, or become captive to our pasts and will explain how we can tap into this underutilized treasure trove. The negative experiences of our past must be recast - reinterpreted so that they no longer lessen our possibilities, but rather serve to expand our understanding of who we are and what we can be.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Spirituality&quot; talks, listen to an interview with filmmaker on Michael Wiese on his experiences with Peruvian shaman Don Jose Campos of Pucallpa, Peru. Internationally respected, Campos introduced to Wiese the practice and benefits of Ayahuasca, the psychoactive plant brew that, according to the latest finds, has been used for healing by Amazonian shamans for as long a 70,000 years. Ayahuasca is called a plant teacher because it can heal physical, psychological and emotional blocks. Through vivid visions, Ayahuasca takes the patient to other realms and dimensions, providing profound insights into human beings&apos; true nature and place in the cosmos.

            <description>A brand new branch of science promises a revolution in health and happiness. It is called Epigenetics - control of genes from outside the cell. We used to think that our DNA determined much of our behavior, as well as our physical characteristics. No more. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Natural Healing&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Dawsen Church. He offers exciting, scientific research to show that many genes are being turned on and off - every day - by your beliefs, feelings, and attitudes.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Growth&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Tracy Ross. She will share her riveting story of her childhood, her relationship with her stepfather and a mistake that has taken 30 years and thousands of miles of raw wilderness to reconcile. Statistically, 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 6 boys have been sexually abused by the time they are eighteen. But unlike most survivors, Ross found the courage and strength to speak out about her experiences and eventually confront her abuser. From skiing in the woods of northern Michigan to trekking across the glaciers of Alaska to guiding teenagers through the deserts of Southern Utah, Tracy pushed herself to the physical limit on her way to becoming whole again.

But unlike most survivors, Ross found the courage and strength to speak out about her experiences and eventually confront her abuser. From skiing in the woods of northern Michigan to trekking across the glaciers of Alaska to guiding teenagers through the deserts of Southern Utah, Tracy pushed herself to the physical limit on her way to becoming whole again.

            <description>Job candidates wrongly believe that job experience is what employers value most. Not so! For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Employment&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Garrett Miller. He&apos;ll explain that there are four traits employers look for in an exceptional job candidate: outstanding work ethic, even in the face of stressors and personal challenges; integrity to do what&apos;s right, especially when forces are telling you to do the opposite; maturity, which enables you to be stable, wise and resilient in times of turmoil; and humility, or the willingness to learn, listen and serve without complaint.

            <description>Managers and employees are often overwhelmed by the amount of change being imposed on them by internal and external forces. Generally, they won&apos;t openly discuss it because it threatens their sense of job security, and as a result, the dilemma gets suppressed, then symptoms emerge like blame, criticism, scapegoating, above normal conflict, lost work days, lower productivity, lack of engagement, and higher turnover become the norm. This is an enormous cost to you and a continuous drain on resources. For Beyond 50&apos;s â??Businessâ?? talks, listen to an interview with Executive Coach, Ed Ferrigan. He will talk about neural science and how the brain works to provide the essential insights to addressing this ongoing issue at a root level.

She&apos;ll talk about a massive undertaking by hundreds of astronomers to survey the sky, called the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

            <description>Italians have influenced American life since the beginning of the Republic. Thomas Jefferson adapted the classic Italian architecture of Andra Palladio in designing his home and the University of Virginia; discussed agronomy and political philosophy with his neighbor, the Italian-trained physician and merchant Philip Mazzei; signed the Declaration of Independence along with William Paca of Maryland; and invited Italian musicians to form the first marine band in Washington, D.C. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;History&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Vincenza Scarpaci.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Personal Growth&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Arnie Kozak, a psychologist who has studied with the Dalai Lama. He&apos;ll talk about original metaphors and creating your own, drawn from Buddhism to clarify mindfulness and encourage us to practice it even amid internal or external chaos.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Parenting&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Jim Fay, founder of the Love &amp; Logic Institute. He&apos;ll give some easy-to-do techniques that are an alternative way to communicate with kids and young adults that places a heavy emphasis on respect towards them. As an example, one of the most effective ways for your kids to stop with the blame game and not wanting to be held accountable for their actions is to give them lots of empathy before delivering the consequences. Fay&apos;s methods make nagging, yelling, threatening, and warnings unnecessary. The turnarounds in their behavior can be amazingly quick!

As an example, one of the most effective ways for your kids to stop with the blame game and not wanting to be held accountable for their actions is to give them lots of empathy before delivering the consequences. Fay&apos;s methods make nagging, yelling, threatening, and warnings unnecessary. The turnarounds in their behavior can be amazingly quick!

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Sustainable Practices&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Dmitry Orlov, the author of &quot;Reinventing Collapse.&quot; He will explain
that the current collapse in America is very similar to what the people of the Soviet Union went through in the 1980s. For the Soviets, the real cause of their country&apos;s breakdown was from the petroleum industry crashing. Learn about how they have had to tap into other natural resources. What is going on in America can be seen as an opportunity. By staying optimistic in a post-oil end game, we can survive and thrive during these challenges.

            <description>The devaluation of the American dollar with the subsequent inflation, is eerily similar to the chaotic markets of the 1970s. The factors that created the stagflation and the gold and silver bull markets of the late 70s and 80s are back. Only this time, they&apos;re ever more exaggerated. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Finance&quot; talks, we&apos;ve brought back Howard Ruff, a nationally renowned financial advisor and author of &quot;How to Prosper in the Coming Bad Years of the 21st Century&quot;. He&apos;ll explain about America becoming a socialist country and how to prosper through investments during a deep, economic recession and depression. This is part 3 of 3 interviews with Howard Ruff.

            <description>The devaluation of the American dollar with the subsequent inflation, is eerily similar to the chaotic markets of the 1970s. The factors that created the stagflation and the gold and silver bull markets of the late 70s and 80s are back. Only this time, they&apos;re ever more exaggerated. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Finance&quot; talks, we&apos;ve brought back Howard Ruff, a nationally renowned financial advisor and author of &quot;How to Prosper in the Coming Bad Years of the 21st Century&quot; about the reality of being in an economic crisis for years, even with the financial programs proposed by President Obama. He&apos;ll also explain about how to prosper through investments during a deep recession. This is part 2 of 3 interviews with Howard Ruff.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Medical Care&quot; talks, listen to an interview with renowned pioneer in preventative cardiology Dr. Michael Ozner. He will explain that heart surgery may not be necessary. Many heart treatment don&apos;t work. Nine major studies in the U.S. and Europe have found that bypass surgery neither prolongs life nor prevents heart attacks in 70 - 90% of patients. Additionally, angioplasties and stents can actually increase the likelihood of future attacks.

            <description>The devaluation of the American dollar with the subsequent inflation, is eerily similar to the chaotic markets of the 1970s. The factors that created the stagflation and the gold and silver bull markets of the late 70s and 80s are back. Only this time, they&apos;re ever more exaggerated. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Finance&quot; talks, learn from Howard Ruff, nationally renowned financial advisor and author of &quot;How to Prosper in the Coming Bad Years of the 21st Century&quot; about how to reap huge profits with relatively small investments in gold, silver, certain ETFs, mutual funds and mining stocks. As a side note, Howard Ruff regards the Social Security program as a Ponzi Scheme by the government and that the actual national debt is about $55 trillion. We&apos;ll go over his ideas in a series of interviews this year and encourage all to tune in for a very unique financial education.

Eni is a highly devout Buddhist nun, ordained by the Holiness the Dalai Lama.

Brother and sister became reacquainted and discovered each other&apos;s philosophy.

            <description>If you&apos;re familiar with alternative energy forms (like solar, wind, geothermal), there is another kind called free energy. The inventors who harness this power create amazing technologies like a car run by a water fuel cell, a battery charger powered by the earth, or a home furnace driven by permanent magnets - most are little known by the public. The most famous of these inventors is Nikola Tesla. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Emerging Trends&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Joel Garbon, a leader in the &quot;Free Energy Revolution&quot; to support these unique inventions so they can be made available for use by the masses. He&apos;ll also discuss about his book called &quot;Breakthrough Power: How Quantum Leap New Energy Inventions Can Change the World.&quot; Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>The latest medical findings point to the importance of two new diagnostic tests: Hemoglobin A1c and C-Reactive Protein - in addition to traditional risk markers in determining overall cardiometabolic risk. These important tests provide vital information to help monitor average glucose levels and inflammation in the body to further determine cardiometabolic risk. For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Medical Care&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Dr. Sanjay Kapur, Scientific Director with ZRT Lab about your heart health and a comprehensive blood spot test you can take at home called the CardioMetabolic Profile 1.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Emerging Trends&quot; talks, listen to Elizabeth Peter of Red Lotus. She is an expert on Eastern and Western Astrology to give her annual predictions. She&apos;s been amazingly accurate for the last two years on-the-show, so we&apos;ve brought her back to go over what&apos;s to come worldwide in 2009. Last January, she predicted America&apos;s financial collapse and breakdown of major industries, from the banking system to traditional media. The upside is that we can rebuild them to be more ethical and sustainable in how they operate for all. Visit www.Beyond50Radio.com and sign up for our free e-newsletter.</description>

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Finance&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Scott Bittle and Jean Johnson about understanding the federal budget in a fun way. According to them, the two biggest financial strains on all is paying for Social Security and Medicare.

Afterwards, Joan Sotkin is back again to talk about our emotional dysfunctions around money and how to really create a foundation for prosperity during hard economic times.

            <description>For Beyond 50&apos;s &quot;Finance&quot; talks, listen to an interview with Harley Schlanger of the Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee (PAC). He offers an even better solution to America&apos;s economic collapse that&apos;s not a hyper-inflationary bailout. Free trade policies and deregulation are the primary causes of the global financial crisis. The answer lies in learning from the past through President Franklin Roosevelt programs to do a Bankruptcy Reoganization; offering government credits to build the nation&apos;s infrastructure; and doing away with globalization.

            <description>When bestselling author Joe Vitale heard stories about a remarkable Hawaiian doctor who healed a ward of mentally ill criminals completely without ever meeting them in person using Ho&apos;oponopono, he was intrigued and wrote about it in &quot;Zero Limits.&quot; Tune in to hear from Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len, the actual healer about how to use this method for yourself that teaches &quot;total responsibility&quot; for everything that is in your life, &quot;cleaning&quot; the negativity, and to reconnect with the Divine. Afterwards, Matthew Brownstein, the Executive Director of the Florida Institute of Hynotherapy will explain about effectively treating conditions (about 30 - 50%) that are psychosomatic (originating from the mind) using hypnotherapy. Our memories are stored in the subconscious mind, and have within them beliefs, which cause our emotions, which can manifest as symptoms in our bodies.

            <description>To kick off the New Year, listen to the hilarious interview with A.J. Jacobs, the Esquire editor (and human guinea pig) who literally spent an entire year following nearly 700+ wise (and some baffling) rules of the Bible, from the Ten Commandments down to stoning adulterers. By becoming an ultra-fundamentalist, he learned many lessons about not taking the Bible too literally in our modern times.
