            <description>Biography: Silverlyn started writing poetry at the young age of 12 while walking outside each night. 
The sights and sounds of the Night fascinated her into writing about it&apos;s transforming beauty. 
Along this time, she also began studying philosophy and religion and was drawn to the the Earth-based paths. 
Taking beliefs from Druidry, Paganism and Wicca, they have given her personal joy and power from then on; their themes reflected in many of her writings. 
Silverlyn is now 40, still loves to write, is happily married and has two grown children and one new grandson. She lives in Wichita, KS with her two cats and two dogs.</description>

            <description>Silverlyn started writing poetry at the young age of 12 while walking outside each night.
 
The sights and sounds of the Night fascinated her into writing about it&apos;s transforming beauty.
Along this time, she also began studying philosophy and religion and was drawn to the the Earth-based paths.
 
Taking beliefs from Druidry, Paganism and Wicca, they have given her personal joy and power from then on; their themes reflected in many of her writings.
 
Silverlyn is now 40, still loves to write, is happily married and has two grown children and one new grandson.
She lives in Wichita, KS with her two cats and two dogs.</description>
