            <description>This week&apos;s upcoming real estate investing Talkcast is about buying low cost property. By low-cost, I am not referring to buying in bad areas or buying junk property. What I am referring to is pursuing investments in areas where the price point is clearly less than in the surrounding market. 

In nearly every market a saavy real estate investor will uncover little pockets of treasure - neighborhoods and communities that, for whatever reason, are bargains compared to the surrounding market.

Learn how to locate these bargain areas, and what to look for - and be wary of - in these bargain pockets. I&apos;ll also be discussing how investing in low-priced properties can be a safer bet than buying expensive homes.</description>

            <description>In this talkcast, I&apos;ll be introducing you to what is one of the best, and safest, real estate investments - buying in new and preconstruction projects. 

Real estate investors are often drawn to the potential in preconstruction, and because of that there is a lot of hype and even charlatanism in preconstruction deals. 

Still, new and preconstruction investing is one of the most consistently profitable ways I know of to invest, especially out of state. I want to teach you to understand preconstruction: how it works, why it works, as well as to dispell the myths and teach you what to stay away from.</description>
