        <description>Right now, The Church has glib Jonahs with tickets in hand, heading in the opposite direction from the call of God; others caught in horrendous storms and causing others to suffer as a result of their disobedience; many swallowed whole by something they can&apos;t get out of. Every one of our Jonahs have been called to be signs and wonders to a rebellious nation; all have been called to say one thing-&quot;Repent&quot;!
